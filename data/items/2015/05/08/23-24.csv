Also, there are many people who lack the aptitude and desire to leave their first-world  home countries-they will simply be out-competed by migrants (most third world migrants who open little shops tend to employ people from the home country rather than locals).<p>There are ways to help poor third world countries:\n1) focus on ameliorating eradicating the worst forms of preventable suffering. Bill Gates is doing this. Improve childhood nutrition to reduce stunting.\n2) Trade with them. While Europe and the U.S. were bailing out their banks, South African corporations have been getting rich selling satellite TV, cellphone services and introducing chain supermarkets to  Africans. You see, they want the same things that the rest of us have. Invest in their countries and make a profit. That will help them in the medium-long term.",1431129570

Some of its faculties are very demanding, some are bogged down by endless red tape, but the education level is pretty good (according to who you ask, ranked among the best in South America). And everyone can get into university, no grades from high school requirements. The &quot;hidden&quot; fee is that university can be pretty demanding, and if you&#x27;re poor and have to work to support yourself or your family, it&#x27;s exhausting and very hard to keep up with your studies; this causes many students to drop out.<p>Here in Argentina there are plenty of private universities to choose if you wish, some cheap, some expensive. Everyone who&#x27;s honest acknowledges public university has the better quality (with a few exceptions), but some people just can&#x27;t have a job and afford the time/dedication public education takes, so they pick a private university with lower dedication demands. And that&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable choice.",1431129413

9514799,comment,9513673,9514751,0,0,seiji,,,"Yeah, the root problem is everybody wants to move where everybody already is.  Big cities have large immigrant communities because cities are walkable or transit-able and have, at the edges, cheap housing stock, so you don&#x27;t need a car or large funds—you can just move in and start your life over.  Then, when you move there, more people from where you were will move there and you will help them get acclimated, then those people will help more new people, then before you know it, where you set down roots is now &quot;Little WhereICameFrom.&quot;<p>But, NYC breaks down if another 8 million people move into it.  San Francisco is 1/10th the size of NYC and it already can&#x27;t handle the people it has.<p>The only way fully open and accepted and world-wide immigration works is under unconscionable &quot;living area restriction&quot; schemes limiting already overly-popular areas.  You either pick an &quot;open&quot; area (Idaho!  North Dakota!) or slot new people into some pre-allocated catchment areas/states with restricted residency/transit for the first 5-15 years of their relocation?  But, that sounds a bit too ghettoy.<p>China can build new cities in the blink of an eye, even if some of them end up going completely unused.  The US can&#x27;t maintain the cities it has and spends $30 billion  to dig a new 2 mile subway ($5 billion towards cost, $25 billion towards corruption).  There <i>are</i> solutions to &quot;everybody wants to live in a better place&quot; problems, but it takes organization, time, resources, a vision for a better future, and generosity.  The world isn&#x27;t currently offering those as a packaged deal.  Be 70s forward-thinking-by-30-years-ahead California, not 2010s only-plan-for-6-months-later California.<p>But, that&#x27;s assuming &quot;aspirational&quot; immigration where 30 million to 300 million people would want to move &quot;to the west&quot; for a chance at a better life.  What about &quot;i got mine, i just want to move&quot; immigration?  NYC<->London?  Sydney<->Chicago?  Something between an educated worker visa and an investor visa?

I think this is a bad idea for several reasons.<p>First off, one of the things that makes Chile great is that its education system is independant of the government.  It results in chileans who are markedly better at critical thinking than americans. (While there one of the things I did was work with high school and college students and of course got to know a lot of chileans.)   Their schools are all about education and keeping the people sending their kids there happy-- by educating them.<p>There is a real effect where the person paying the bills calls the shots.  When government is paying the bills, turning out good citizens is the goal.  This is why the football players are the heroes of most schools and the computer nerds are beat up.  This is why schools are enacting absurd zero tolerance policies.  This is why standardized tests and teachers tenure and unions are so bad.<p>There really is something to the market incentive to provide a better experience at lower cost...<p>The socialists are in power in chile right now but I don&#x27;t think that will last long, and the reality is the Chilean constitution is pretty well protecting capitalism.  Consequently the government runs a surplus does a great job of providing services and mostly stays out of peoples way... and Chile is the south american economic miracle as a result.",1431128278

We are discussing features and extensibility of finer languages than Java.<p>> <i>The example I gave above -- based off LanceH&#x27;s -- of transactions is a way where the macro-based solution is more elegant than non-macro solutions.</i><p>Here we disagree. In your example of transactions, you didn&#x27;t shown that macro-based solutions are more elegant than non-macro based solutions; you merely showed that Java before version 8 wasn&#x27;t very good (and when someone replied &quot;but we can do better with Java 8!&quot; you basically replied &quot;ok, but how do you know Java 8 is enough for some other unspecified problem?&quot;). Your answer is unconvincing, especially since non-macro-based solutions to your example in other languages, such as Scala, are equally elegant to Lisp&#x27;s, because Scala has support for first-class functions and closures.

There are no hard and fast rules, often it&#x27;s just a gut feeling, but here are the mistakes I used to make & how to try to avoid them:<p>1) People who want to discuss their site for an hour or more on skype are not proper businessmen.<p>Look for people who&#x27;s time is money - they have some key questions for you, they don&#x27;t just want to &quot;chat&quot; about their idea. People who just want to chat - get your hourly rate mentioned early. If you tell them &quot;I charge X&quot; and they still want to talk a bit, then go with your gut, but don&#x27;t talk more than 15min. with anyone without giving some indication of the price.<p>2) Don&#x27;t lower your price unless you are repeatedly being rejected at that price level BY THE TYPE OF CLIENT YOU WANT.<p>That second part is important - your price will screen out the little projects you aren&#x27;t really after. Don&#x27;t worry if it is doing that job. But others will reflexively ask for a better deal, and won&#x27;t push back hard if you don&#x27;t budge. $10/hr less at &quot;full-time&quot; costs you $20,000 year that you&#x27;ll never earn back.<p>What always seemed to happen to me was, the moment I agreed to a lower rate, someone would come along who was willing to pay full rate, and now I&#x27;m massively stressed trying to do everything.<p>3) Ask to see any specs and/or designs early - offer to sign an NDA right up front<p>This is to let you see how prepared they are, how professional they are, and if the work is defined well enough to be able to offer a weekly rate. Weekly rates are great, but they can be a harder sell for certain types of work.<p>4) Weekly rates are NOT risky if you define the number of hours/amount of work you can reasonable expect in a week.<p>Project rates are dangerous. Weekly rates just mean, &quot;Of course I can do that! You understand that will cost X, correct? Would you like to cut something else out, or just approve the overrun?&quot;<p>Weekly rates DO mean you need to be professional - you are promising 40-50hrs of actual work.

Create a career learning plan of technologies you want to improve at, and use down time to study those. Don&#x27;t jump around to new languages/server tools/whatever that a potential client mentions & never get good at anything.<p>To a point that&#x27;s ok, when you really ARE new and need to get familiar with what is out there & being used, but get away from that habit quickly. If it looks useful, schedule it in your Career learning plan & visit at the appropriate time.<p>I know there&#x27;s plenty more, but I think those are solid enough that I feel comfortable offering them to people.<p>Good luck!",1431127641

Students unable to get good scores has no other chance. Lazy rich kids who are not interested in studying, go to private colleges, basically, to buy a &quot;title&quot;.

They increased taxes hoping to collect additional money from taxpayers (which didn&#x27;t work), without knowing how they are going to use the funds.<p>4) Those students leaders that are now part of congress, deceived the people that supported them and are now supporting completely different things than what they said they would when they were leading the people that got them elected. They basically sold out.<p>5) The article is from February. Only 2 days ago, the president of Chile announced she was asking for the resignation of all of her ministers.

Today, Taiwan is wealthy, and is on track to be one of the richest countries in the world by 2050.[1] Taiwan is far from having open immigration so far, but it has taken in tens of thousands of guest workers from other, poorer countries in Asia, and is a bit unusual in having a big phenomenon of &quot;foreign brides.&quot;[2] Free movement of people into Taiwan doesn&#x27;t yet match the former rather vigorous movement of people out of Taiwan into the United States, but it is increasing, and all around the world the countries that are especially welcoming to immigrants are largely also countries that gain in prosperity over time.<p>As the article correctly points out, just more than a century ago in the United States, many people worried that HUGE rates of immigration from non-English-speaking countries would be dangerous to this country. They were wrong. Both my maternal grandparents were born in the United States, but their schooling was conducted entirely in the German language. My paternal grandmother was also born in the United States, and attended school only in English, but she attended church services in the Norwegian language and spoke Norwegian at home. Even the descendants of languages less closely cognate to English than those have grown up to be English-speakers just like me. This is not a problem. The strength of the United States (as the article points out) was established in the era when the United States had essentially no restrictions on immigration. I wouldn&#x27;t mind bringing back those days. If other countries didn&#x27;t try the same policy, the United States would just grow faster at their expense.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/48686889"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/48686889</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/15/news/adfg-brides15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/15/news/adfg-brides15</a><p><a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304198004575171232326284928"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023041980045751712...</a>",1431127205

So what Holacracy offered above what we already had was rigid structure, and cumbersome terminology.<p>It also has a weird religious vibe in that the Holacracy franchise holders who we turned to for input on our implementation of it refused to work with us unless we adhered to the defined process 100%. No modifying it to suit our company.<p>The formal governance meeting process caused a severe backlash when rigidly adhered to because it only allowed one &quot;reaction round&quot;[1], so if someone else&#x27;s reaction caused a new viewpoint to arise in your mind, but you had already spoken, too bad. Our facilitator who had attended the training rigidly enforced this process, and several people, myself included, felt silenced.<p>So yeah, as we weren&#x27;t a traditionally pyramid structured company to begin with, we had very little to gain from it - we tried it because we had started with 5 employees and no governance beyond &quot;let&#x27;s ask the boss&quot;, and we had grown to a point where we needed to get _some_ governance in place, because while intra-team decisions were fine and dandy, how we made decisions affecting everyone was really unclear.<p>So in the end, we dropped it. We have kept some of the ideas we found useful, for example the separation between governance and tactical meetings, and the idea of the &#x27;lead link&#x27; or their equivalent being opposed by the &#x27;rep link&#x27; equivalent, in our case, it&#x27;s our proxy product owners (PPO) and their eternal opponents are our scrum masters. It&#x27;s a healthy tension between what the business wants and what the team wants.<p>The other valuable thing we&#x27;ve kept was the objection and objection testing process - if someone has an idea, objecting just because you don&#x27;t like it is not considered valid. You need to be able to present a coherent argument as to how the proposal, if adopted, would harm the company. It means that the &quot;Bah humbug&quot; curmudgeons can&#x27;t stall innovation. Basically it boils down to &quot;Would it hurt us to try this?&quot; as a test for a new idea.<p>So now our governance consists of a small group of &#x27;executives&#x27; for want of a better word, and what we call &quot;The General Circle&quot;. The &quot;executives&quot; is our boss and two 2ICs (to increase our bus factor to keep our business team happy) one with an HR and finance focus, the other with a businss analysis / product development focus. This group&#x27;s primary focus is the relationship with our business team, but it also handles the aspects of running a company that require handling an employee&#x27;s confidential information, like pay reviews and HR issues.<p>But every other cross-company decision is made by the General Circle, a group consisting of the PPO and scrum master from each team, plus our finance and HR specialists. These discussions are totally open to anyone else who wants to attend, and our financial performance is tabled as a matter of course, with more detailed numbers and budgets available for the curious. PPOs are theoretically appointed by the General Circle (our existing PPOs were in their roles before this governance guff, so no new ones have needed to be appointed yet), while Scrum Masters are selected by the team however they like. I think all our teams rotate it every six months or so.<p>Oh, and we also like the election process from Holacracy - write down a person&#x27;s name on a piece of paper, with your name on it, and then in the discussion, you say why. After everyone has explained their reasoning, people can then change their votes if they heard a good point that persuaded them.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Governance_Meetings#Reactions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Governance_Meeting...</a>",1431127042

A direct consequence of those for-profit institutions was a constant decrease in the quality of higher education, at expenses of overcrowding classrooms or hiring bad professors.

The longer you&#x27;ve worked with us, the more personal relationships you have developed, perhaps with the same people making the decision to eliminate your position. A generous severance (which IMO requires a tenure component) sends an important signal of stability to the employees who remain AND makes it easier for managers (who are of course humans themself) to make the decision to eliminate the position of a long-tenured but &quot;surplus to ongoing operations&quot; employee.<p>What&#x27;s the alternative?

3909245,comment,3908964,3908964,8,0,pilom,,,"I'm really not impressed with this guy's description. His understanding of a 3d transistor is flawed. Currently 3d transistors are just one layer of the transistor which has a rectangular cross section to reduce leakage. Future 3d processors will have transistors layered on top of other transistors. Granted heat dissipation becomes a harder problem for those processors but ""a hard problem"" is much easier to overcome than the theoretical laws of physics at 5nm.<p>Also, I don't like how his go to solution for after silicon is molecular computing. He said himself that silicon breaks down when we are around 5 atoms across. How big are the molecules which we can use as switches? Much more than 5 atoms across. Molecular computing will not get a transistor density any greater than silicon will.",1335794248

You end up implementing relational db backed by object collections.

I haven&#x27;t even mentioned one distro vs the other.. So in fact I&#x27;m now interested at what distro do you run.<p>Its always interesting to talk about a great desktop Linux experience.. Maybe on par with osx. I don&#x27;t care which Linux as long as its some Linux. The sat solver based package manager was a very serious engineering effort, to resolve circular dependencies among packages, etc. That is also an interesting thought experiment for people who might not know about it. That&#x27;s a feature that I believe is made redundant by static package managers like Click packages.<p>In fact, I will gladly argue with anybody on what I feel is the true future of Linux - desktop Android!!!",1446613110

Citing a previous poster, around 70 MT of uranium is used every year, which comes to about 6.3 G$, which comes to about 2.61 $/TWh. As per the NEI, the cost of nuclear energy is 108 $/TWh. At current prices, uranium accounts for 2.4% of the cost of producing nuclear energy.<p>Keeping the same profit margins under an increase of one order of magnitude of the price of uranium would mean increasing the price of nuclear energy by roughly 20%.",1446613064

I may be mistaken, but my impression was that they sort of separate their products into two groups - the ad-related are earning the money, and then the money is spent on funding something else (like GMail), with little direct connection between the two groups.

According to this idea by doing this you can live fully. For me this seems a bit vague, but it did plant a seed in my head.<p>The thing is, meditation teaches you equanimity, which from my understanding means being able to feel but without judgement. When I was in deep meditation I experienced equanimity a couple of times. At one point my muscles were aching so much by sitting perfectly still that I walked like a cripple after that meditation session. My body just could not perform normally, which I found odd in a sense. Yet, I never felt any pain, I noticed my body was having a hard time sitting perfectly upright in a still position, that was it. Or perhaps better said: I did feel a form of pain (aka that something is wrong with my body), but I never experienced any suffering from it. The converse is also true with regards to pleasure (e.g. small forms of non-clinical addiction).<p>What I learned from practicing equanimity is that I prefer to die while using this skill. Because to me it means I won&#x27;t die by suffering from pain or pleasure, I just die and experience how it feels. It could be pain, it might be pleasure, either way I just experience it and nothing more.<p>Note: while equanimity has to be explained through language, it&#x27;s not an intellectual concept in the sense that riding a bike isn&#x27;t an intellectual concept. It&#x27;s something you do. Intellectualising about riding a bike won&#x27;t get you anywhere, same goes for equanimity in the way that I&#x27;ve been taught.",1446610550

10504522,comment,10503603,10504261,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Swarm and Kubernetes are definitely competitors.<p>Swarm is a container manager that automatically starts and stops containers in a cluster using a scheduling algorithm. It implements the Docker API, so it actually acts as a facade that aggregates all the hosts in the pool. So you talk to it just like you would with a single-host Docker install, but when you tell Swarm to start a given container, it will schedule it somewhere in the cluster. Asking Swarm to list the running instances, for example, would list everything running on all the machines.<p>Kubernetes is also a container manager. The biggest difference is perhaps that it abstracts containers into a few high-level concepts — it&#x27;s not tightly coupled with Docker and apparently Google plans to support other backends — that map more directly to how applications are deployed in practice. For example, it comes with first-class support for exposing containers as &quot;services&quot; which it can then route traffic to. Kubernetes has a good design, but for various reasons the design feels overly complicated, which is not helped by some of the terminology they&#x27;ve invented (like replication controllers, which aren&#x27;t program, but a kind of declaration), nor by its somewhat enterprisy documentation.<p>Kubernetes is also complicated by the fact that every pod must be allocated a public (or at least routable) IP. If you&#x27;re in a private data center that already has a DHCP server set up, that&#x27;s a non-issue, but in this day and age, most people probably will need an overlay network. While there are tons of such solutions — Open vSwitch (aka OVS), GRE tunnels, IPsec meshes, OpenVPN, Tinc, Flannel (formerly Rudder), VXLAN, L2TP, etc. — none of them can be called <i>simple</i>. Of course, plain Docker doesn&#x27;t solve this in any satisfactory way, either, but at least you can be productive with Docker without jumping into the deep end like Kubernetes forces you to do.<p>Docker Networking is a stab at solving the issue by creating an overlay network through VXLAN, which gives you a Layer 2 overlay network. VXLAN has historically been problematic because it has required multicast UDP, something few cloud providers implement, and I didn&#x27;t know VXLAN was a mature contender; but apparently the kernel has supported unicast (which cloud providers to support) since at least 2013. If so, that&#x27;s probably the simplest overlay solution of all the aforementioned.<p>As for Compose, it&#x27;s a small tool that can start a bunch of Docker containers listed in a YAML file. It&#x27;s unrelated to Swarm, but can work with it. It was designed for development and testing, to make it easy to get a multi-container app running; there&#x27;s no &quot;master&quot; daemon that does any provisioning or anything like that. You just use the &quot;compose&quot; tool with that one config file, and it will start all the containers mentioned in the file. While its usefulness is limited right now (for example, you can&#x27;t ensure that two containers run on the same host, unlike Kubernetes with its pods), the Docker guys are working on making it more mature for production use.",1446609749

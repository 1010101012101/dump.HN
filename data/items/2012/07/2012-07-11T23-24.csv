4232074,comment,4231219,4231916,8,0,bobwaycott,,,"You should both read up on the history of the French Revolution, as well as the definition of the word ""conceived"". Yes, the parent was off in calling out the French Revolution specifically, but the actual statement made was spot-on.<p>The American Revolution was, in fact, <i>built on earlier and contemporaneous ideas</i>, found in myriad writings of <i>mostly non-American</i> Enlightenment thinkers who had been working out various new, altered, subversive, or otherwise novel ideas, studies, and classifications in political theory (among other topics) for nearly 125 years before American founders built upon them in both the Articles of Confederation and the US Constitution. A basic review of political theory in the Age of Enlightenment would both confirm for you the correctness of the parent's statements (despite the errant inclusion of the French Revolution), as well as help you see exactly where the American Revolution got the whole of its ideas. America's founders very much imbibed on the Enlightenment, particularly works of political theory.<p>The French Revolution was not in any way ""conceived of"" as a result of the American Revolution. Instead, it had been growing in its own specifically French/European manner among the salons and their <i>philosophes</i>, and was quite in step with the march of Enlightenment across much of Western Europe. Ultimately this was brought to a head when, seeing that the Americans' disregard for English rule was something they, too, could emulate in order to bring Enlightenment ideals to practical fruition in France, shit got started in the Estates-General in May 1789 (just two months after the Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation, bringing the fully Montesquieu-esque political system into reality).<p>I apologize if I seem overly pedantic, but when you call out someone to check a timeline based on two words in an otherwise sound comment that added something to the discussion, you should at least ensure you have your own timeline correct--particularly if you are going to be bandying about the idea that Historical Event X ""was not even conceived of until after"" Historical Event Y. History rarely works like that, especially when it is happening but a handful of years apart.<p>Ultimately, what Abb Sieys said in his famous pamphlet, ""What is the Third Estate?"", is so applicable to both revolutions as to further indicate that a revolutionary wave was both forming and interacting on both sides of the Atlantic (trans-Atlantic intellectual and cultural history is an eye-opening field of study):<p><i>""What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something.""</i><p>The Americans espoused the same sentiment. Neither the American founders nor the Estates-General were owners of that idea, though. They both took it from 125 years of hundreds of intellectuals hammering it out.<p><i></i>EDIT:<i></i> Formatting & a couple extraneous words.",1342050227

I often encountered either nationalist jabs royal treatment from strangers simply due to what was on TV at the time.  In quite a few people I encountered both views.  Some told me point blank that they thought that the US was the best place in the world and that they didn't understand why I left... only to change gears minutes later and tell me what a dangerous, terrible country America is.  A love-hate relationship with America and Americans is very common in China.  In Taiwan, where I lived for 7 years, I pretty much only encountered love.  In Guatemala, I saw both, but very muted compared to China.  I did encounter some serious hate from some Canadians there, though... I spent hours helping them translate and apartment hunt, after which they realized I was American, not Canadian.  Amazingly, this was such a big deal to them that they pretty much forgot my kind deed and blew me off!<p>As for affection, I think pretty much everywhere I lived in Asia saw Americans as outgoing and affectionate.  In Guatemala, we were seen as reserved.  I'd put us at the middle of the continuum, not at the extreme non-affectionate end.<p>Americans aren't that status obsessed.  Just look at sales of luxury cars and handbags.  Chinese people tend to be status-obsessed.  Rich people in the US are surprisingly restrained by comparison.<p>Ditto on unhealthiness.  After moving to the US 2 months ago I find there's very little drinking, people never smoke in offices, not many people smoke at all, and I haven't seen a single scuffle outside a restaurant yet.  It's certainly not as health-focused as someplace like Japan, and food portions are too big, but there is a culture of exercise.  On the whole I'd say Boulder, Colorado is the healthiest place I've ever lived.  SF isn't bad.<p>I agree that the health care system leaves a lot to be desired.  I do miss Taiwan's quite a bit.  It amazed me how it was cheap, high quality and somehow supported by a very low tax rate.  I prefer the US system to China's or Guatemala's though.<p>One constant I've found over the past 10 years is that no matter where I live, I encounter American movies at the theaters, news about the US on TV, American restaurants and businesses in the streets, and a lot of people who very much want to understand my home country better.  Sometimes it was frustrating when I was looking for total immersion and an experience living someplace completely different from home.  My Swedish and Argentinian classmates in Taiwan could go weeks without hearing their mother tongues or seeing anything about their countries in any media, but I could not.  Even a single day would be almost impossible because in truth the US <i>is</i> exceptional among countries.<p>In short, I think this list is closer to a European caricature of the US than it is to reality.",1342049365

If you go the whole basic service argument then not only do you provide a wifi hotspot but you also provide a way for someone to browse the web, send and receive email, and maybe chat at these same kiosks. If you don't provide that then you run into the social justice argument that you are discriminating against the poor who can't afford a smartphone or laptop to hop onto the 'free' WiFi in favor of the rich. Whereas if you charge for the access and dump that money into the general fund (after expenses of course) then its a service fee that achieves a socially acceptable taxation of people with more disposable income to provide services to those without.

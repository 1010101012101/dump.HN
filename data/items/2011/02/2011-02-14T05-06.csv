While it's not programming, I knew she wanted to make her own game and simply told her to do the tutorial and go from there. 6 hours later she had the basic tutorial finished and was hard at work on her own game. She figured out how actions worked, started reading about the scripting and designed her own characters. She loves it and I am glad to offer any advice along the way, however if she stops playing with it, that will be fine too.",1297663161

There is roughly one admissible source -- ""Through the looking glass"" in Trends in Functional Programming. Small workshop paper, 12 citations according to CiteSeer. Doesn't show up in the ACM Digital Library. There are a number of other papers on Saarland University's website, but they are either 1) not peer reviewed (tech reports) 2) not cited or 3) not actually about Alice ML. To illustrate #3, consider ""A concurrent lambda-calculus with Futures"". This is a relatively well-cited paper, and it mentions Alice ML (a sentence or two?), but it isn't actually <i>about</i> Alice ML! It describes a new language construct and models the semantics in the lambda-calculus. In this case, wouldn't it be the construct, not the language that is notable?<p>I gave the following example in my Wikipedia talk page: the first paper on functional reactive programming is very famous. It describes a DSL called Fran.

2215486,comment,2215365,2215365,0,0,dmg8,,,"It would have saved me a ton of frustration and wasted effort if it were a lot less than currently. In high school I remember hating math - it was obvious some people were far better at grinding through computations than I could ever hope to be, and it made me resentful being forced to go through what seemed a pointless exercise.<p>In university I made a late switch to computer science, and took real analysis thinking it would be very painful, but would make up for having no calculus. I actually enjoyed so much I switched to math, and so did sort of a math crash course over a year to prepare for grad school. Some of the math was hell. Studying differential equations, complex variables (computation oriented), and bits of differential geometry, etc. would leave me with so frustrated, wondering why I was putting myself through this. On the other hand, measure theory, complex analysis, functional analysis, algebra, and galois theory were so illuminating. I could just sit there for hours working through proofs, and not burn out.<p>However, this would not work for everyone (or most even). It shocked me that everyone else didn't see it my way, so it was very interesting observing how others studied/thought about math. I had a friend in all my pure math classes whom I worked on assignments with. He was a computational wizard who could flawlessly plow through pages of computations. My rate of errors - flipping a sign, carelessly misapplying a rule, etc. - was so much higher than his I had to conclude our brains were just wired in a totally different way. I noticed, when trying to prove something, we'd proceed very differently. He'd take what he knew to be true, and just begin enumerating some logical consequences of that, and go in the direction which seemed to have the smallest blowup in data. I'd usually assume the statement was false, and think and think and think about why that would be so absurd. Then, when I came up with the abstract explanation in my mind, in my mind I'd shape it into something concrete enough to write down (or even describe).<p>I identify a lot with the mathematician Alexander Grothendieck (at least before he became a little eccentric), because he's one of the rare examples (I know of) of an outstanding mathematician who seems to have approached math the way I do, and derives value from it for similar reasons. AG was reknowned for thinking about math in an extremely abstract way: many people learn by taking specific examples and then playing around with them mechanically until they get a general 'feel' for what's going on. Instead AG would describe the phenomenon being observed in the most abstract and general way possible, sometimes building an entire new theory of which the solution to the original problem was merely a trivial consequence.<p>Here is a two part piece biographical essay that, regardless of your interest in math, you'll probably find very interesting. He led an extraordinary life:<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/35435936/As-If-Summoned-from-the-Void-The-Life-of-Alexandre-Grothendieck-Part2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/35435936/As-If-Summoned-from-the-V...</a><p>EDIT: Hmm, I sort of went off on a general rant instead of making the point I intended (this tiny text field makes that so easy, haha). I wanted to point out it's a common distinction in math made between the ""problem solvers"" and the ""theory builders"" (AG, mentioned above, epitomizes the latter). Most subjects in pure math are populated by people in one field or the other, and I believe that by forcing a computational approach on people early in their development, you're completely turning people off of math who could have fallen in love with the abstract theory. How prevalent this is, I don't know.",1297662745

Some things, like solving simple algebra and simultaneous equations are done to death, get the students to understand the concept, do a few different examples and move on.

Misguided people who in most cases could never write a good article (or even improve an existing one) themselves are running amok because the system is re-enforcing the belief that their only talent, destroying information, is also a valid form of contribution. It is no statistical accident that rampant wiki deletionism is even more intense in ...""strict"" countries such as Germany.<p>At the same time it is important to note that a lot of articles have serious shortcomings and are in need of improvement. While deleting them is in my opinion unforgivable as long as they contain useful  information, I believe Wikipedia could profit from a more modern approach to article rating and validation. If substandard articles were allowed to continue existing albeit with low ratings and missing validation tags, Wikipedia as a process could focus more on improvement as opposed to gleeful pruning. If they concentrated on more constructive measures and included better ways of gathering user feedback for quality control, they could also provide former deletionist users with a UI option that simply prevents them from ever having to see an article that is below a certain quality threshold. Everybody would win.<p>As it stands today, Wikipedia increasingly fails at its stated mission of being a repository for the world's knowledge. Sadly, I don't believe it is possible to change Wikipedia in any way, ever. Someday, someone will have to come along and fork it.",1297660488

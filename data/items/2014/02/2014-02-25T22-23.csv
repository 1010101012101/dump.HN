7301318,comment,7300392,7300392,16,0,foobarqux,,,"From Scott Aaronson:<p>> If one considers only the ~10% of instances on which the D-Wave machine does best, then the machine does do slightly better on those instances than simulated annealing does.  (Conversely, simulated annealing does better than the D-Wave machine on the ~75% of instances on which it does best.)  Unfortunately, no one seems to know how to characterize the instances on which the D-Wave machine will do best: one just has to try it and see what happens!  And of course, it’s extremely rare that two heuristic algorithms will succeed or fail on exactly the same set of instances: it’s much more likely that their performances will be correlated, but imperfectly.  So it’s unclear, at least to me, whether this finding represents anything other than the “noise” that would inevitably occur even if one classical algorithm were pitted against another one.<p>He continues:<p>> However, I neglected to mention that even the slight “speedup” on ~10% of instances, only appears when one looks at the “quantiles of ratio”: in other words, when one plots the probability distribution of [Simulated annealing time / D-Wave time] over all instances, and then looks at (say) the ~10% of the distribution that’s best for the D-Wave machine.  The slight speedup disappears when one looks at the “ratio of quantiles”: that is, when one (say) divides the amount of time that simulated annealing needs to solve its best 10% of instances, by the amount of time that the D-Wave machine needs to solve its best 10%.  And Rønnow et al. give arguments in their paper that ratio of quantiles is probably the more relevant performance comparison than quantiles of ratio.  (Incidentally, the slight speedup on a few instances also only appears for certain values of the parameter r, which controls how many possible settings there are for each coupling.  Apparently it appears for r=1, but disappears for r=3 and r=7—thereby heightening one’s suspicion that we’re dealing with an artifact of the minimum annealing time or something like that, rather than a genuine speedup.)",1393369148

Where is the equal distribution of resources, the control of the economy by workers, or any of the rest of the Marxist programme?

You hear it from train driver unions, banks, and doctors.<p>There is merit in what they say about safety, but they see it not as a set of problems that might be overcome, but as a way of shutting down the conversation. They don&#x27;t want to think about how easily a significant part of what they do could be automated or eliminated.<p>The heuristic is not that they object, it is that they don&#x27;t want to discuss, even as speculation.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that one place these objections haven&#x27;t come up is air travel. Because if you think about it, air travel should be a place we fear to automated, but we already did it. Autopilot sort of sneaked in before people realized what automation was, and pilots are comfortable that they still have a place alongside the machines, so they are happy to talk, and explain as slowly as necessary that automated landing might be a good idea one day, but automating a crash landing wouldn&#x27;t work out well.<p>The way this usually seems to work out is, everyone says it&#x27;s impossible, until someone does it, and eats the other players alive. The most interesting thing here is that the insurers are the barrier. When drone designs are up and running, there will be a niche for an insurer that will take the risk, and in these days of crowd funding, you wouldn&#x27;t need to be an entrenched player to take it.",1393368876

7301101,comment,7299826,7300395,1,0,sigil,,,"> But I still see the lack of reversibility of transactions (one of bitcoin&#x27;s strengths) as the major problem here.<p>&quot;Stop Saying Bitcoin Transactions Aren&#x27;t Reversible&quot; <a href=""http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-arbitration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-arbitration/</a><p>The n-of-m multisignature facilities described in that article are the future of Bitcoin. You probably don&#x27;t need multisig arbitration when you buy a coffee or a stick of gum, but you probably do when you&#x27;re transferring large sums. Of course, there was no multisig protection in sight in the MtGox case, but then there was no blockchain in sight either. Far worse errors of judgement were made there.<p>Bitcoin makes the use of arbitration services optional, <i>and</i> it makes the actual mechanics of arbitration services safer and more efficient. The arbiter in a 2-of-3 multisig transaction can&#x27;t freeze or seize funds in transit -- hello PayPal! -- and takes zero action in the vast majority of cases, where there is no dispute.<p>Banks, credit card companies, and existing payment systems like PayPal can&#x27;t easily, optionally disintermediate themselves. They must play arbiter. And we must pay for it.<p>> bitcoin tries to workaround them for no good reason.<p>There&#x27;s a good reason. Why do businesses today pay transaction fees when you use your card to buy that coffee?<p>I&#x27;ll just quote the opening paragraph of the original Bitcoin paper:<p>&quot;Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.&quot;<p><a href=""https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>",1393367087

It is, overall, a very small part of freight theft, the vast majority of which happens on land. This should be obvious: on land, you don&#x27;t need a boat big enough to float a container to steal a container. You just need a access to a semi-tractor and maybe a trailer.<p>If you make the technical demands on a successful hijacking higher, I expect these numbers to fall.<p>I also expect self-driving trucks to sharply cut theft, rather than enable it.",1393366591

Take the note taking webapp they use as an example. Without javascript crypto, anyone who breaks into the server can read everyones notes. Likewise, the FBI can get a warrant and have the owner of the web application turn over everyones notes.<p>If they do use javascript crypto, instead of just getting a warrant for the machine, the fbi has to convince the owner of the site to modify their source code to target an individual user to steal their key. That is a significant difference. Also, the victim user has to log in again for that attack to be successful, if they just used the server for a couple weeks and left, they are safe.<p>Likewise, an attacker who breaks into the server can&#x27;t get a dump of all the notes in the system.

This means that you could download the webapp anonymously, inspect/audit/checksum it, then run it from your local filesystem in the browser (try it! just right click and Save As...). Alternatively, you could load it from a server that you would trust to kill itself rather than comply with a secret court-ordered compromise (e.g. Lavabit, Internet Archive, etc.).<p>Additionally, since the webapp is just static files, all the webapp server sees is anonymous requests (over https to prevent MITM). It doesn&#x27;t know who is requesting the static files, so it would be difficult to perform a targeted malicious injection. You would have to broadcast the injection, which is generally ill-advised since it might be spotted by a vigilant third party. Most of the surveillance injection attacks that have been leaked have been targeted, so this basically cuts off that attack vector.<p>So, in order to compromise this webapp through injection, you&#x27;d have to hack into the trusted static server and blindly serve the injection to everyone who requests the webapp (hopefully including your target). This is basically the same attack vector you&#x27;d have to do if you were trying to inject something into a download-and-install local application.<p>I don&#x27;t think javascript crypto is universally a good idea, but for this unhosted use case, it can limit attack vectors to the same as download-and-install local applications.<p>> Browser Javascript is hostile to cryptography.<p>True, which is why WebCryptoAPI should be prioritized, and I can stop using SJCL in byoFS. Once APIs for crypto primitives are baked into browsers, this argument disappears.<p>> The &quot;view-source&quot; transparency of Javascript is illusory.<p>It&#x27;s certainly much better than inspecting desktop apps. Also, if your webapp is unhosted, you can certainly publish a signed hash of the static files, which can be verified after you download the app and before you run it.<p>One infrastructure improvement that might be very helpful would be to be able to buy an SSL certificate from a CA that is limited to a particular file hash, which the browser checks before showing the connection as &quot;validated&quot; (maybe a checkmark beside the https lock?).<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/diafygi/byoFS#security-and-philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diafygi/byoFS#security-and-philosophy</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://pay.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/289w7x/bring_your_own_chat_javascript_secure_chat_using/ci9cx7q?context=4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pay.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/289w7x/bring_your_o...</a>",1403009043

These charges tend to make the molecules attract and stick together (the -ve are attracted to the + charges). The temperature of anything corresponds roughly to the kinetic energy of the bits of stuff it&#x27;s made of. At 0K everything is still. At 373K (== 100C) the water molecules have enough energy at normal pressure for the molecules to fly apart and have your kettle boil. You can raise this temperature by putting the water in a pressure cooker to physically push the molecules back together - this works to about 120C in a normal pressure cooker. At some temperature however, no matter how much pressure you put on, the molecules do not stick to each other to form a liquid because they have too much kinetic energy and keep flying apart. This happens at around 647K in water. Above that the steam/liquid is called supercritical.

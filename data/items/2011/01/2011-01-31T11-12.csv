2161131,story,,,1,1,NikitaVorontsov,"File format converter/verifier: marketing research question",,"Hello,<p>I am C/C++ programmer with 7 years of development experience for Windows/Linux in outsourcing companies. Although learning new things is really intriguing I fill like I need to concentrate my self on some certain aspect(s) of computing to achieve some significant results, rather than bouncing from one area to another (typical for contract job). In order to achieve mentioned goal I have decided to learn internals of a bunch of file formats and provide solutions like file format converters or repairing  utilities. I have chosen this area because I really like working with file formats, data structures and exchange protocols. Especially when it comes to binary formats.
So my question is: which file format converting/repairing task may be considered as worth the effort (by means of popularity/demand) ?
May be someone can point me to some sophisticated way to estimate the demand for such kind of tasks ? This will also be highly appreciated.<p>Thanks in advance for the time taken to respond to this rather naive answer.<p>Regards",1296475115

If you are working as a marketing person for General Mills and then decide that you want to break into ibanking, an MBA is great. It allows you to re-enter a very standardized recruiting process versus having to haplessly apply to random jobs. The same goes for people who work in fields where hiring and promoting is very standardized. At certain F500 companies/investment banks/PE firms it is expected that after 2-4 years of working you'll go back and get your MBA (if you want to be promoted). It's pretty dumb, but that's the way it works. Certain star performers can sidestep that but it tends to occur less frequently.<p>At the same time, for certain careers which are based more on merit (trading, entrepreneurship) an MBA might be less helpful.

Can Silicon Valley pull it off? Well, from a foreigners perspective (commenting from Lisbon, Portugal) Silicon Valley has a very engineer centric perspective on problem solving, and while engineering inputs may be useful, this is not an engineering problem, it's an economics problem.<p>Take P2P loans (Zoppa, Prosper, Lending Club) for instance. Why aren't they gaining traction? Because while they try to change the main Business Model for banks, they fail to solve the fundamental problem of Information Assimetry. That's the ""reason d'etre"" of the Banks. Banks business model is not just ""skin you alive in loan fee's"", they solve what we economists call ""Adverse Selection"" problem: how to sort good from bad credit. They are basically information arbitragers. They pool your credit info, compute a score, and sort loan suppliers with loan demand. The cost of doing so is expensive for an individual investor. And there is a problem of ""preference revelation"", or, in layman's terms, people lie and try to free ride.<p>That's why banks exist. Is the model ripe for disruption? Yes, it hasn't really changed fundamentally since the last 300 years since the ""Venizian Banca"" but for that one need to solve the affordable decentralised sorting between creditors and debtors accounting for fraud, incentives to lie and free ride and asymmetrical information.<p>IMO, Facebook brought a good innovation to the table. And no, I'm not talking about the ""like button"", social hype (attach social to something and somehow you have an Alchemical transformation of iron to gold): Applied Network Theory.<p>Social Networking might be a good research direction to solving the P2P information problem solving, by revealing our preferences.<p>Payment methods have a different problem to it: fraud. You can, and usually do, bleed money on it. Paypal did, and still does. To counter it, you make it more painful to do transactions (that's why Paypal is, sometimes, bloody annoying). Pain acts as a filter to fraud. That's why Banking is so cumbersome. Again, pain as a filter for fraud. Think of it like this: Google could reduce spam by making it painful to search and index (reductio ad absurdum oversimplification). It's a simple ""no innovation"" solution.<p>There is a lot of innovation to be made. But it's a bit more complicated. It's not just ""make a new cute web 2.0 interface to sort your personal finances"" like Mint.<p>Just my 2 cents.<p>(PS: pardon the occasional english typing error. Not a native speaker)",1296474362

For example:<p>> There was a root privilege escalation on one of our platforms which permitted exposure of credentials that were then used to access machines with externally-facing SSH.<p>How are the credentials exposed after escalation? What accounts on the externally-facing SSH machines were used? Why was it a problem that the externally-facing SSH machines could be accessed? Was the access through root accounts? Why do externally-facing SSH machines allow remote root-login?<p>Besides, why can I still download projects when the data validation is still ongoing?<p>Furthermore, the 'full report' does not say anything what SF.net plans about their ssh servers.<p>I understand the SF.net team does its best, but I am not so happy with that report.",1296472995

The wealth of plugins is simply awesome. Only recently I started using Tumblr and you are right, the design is outstanding. Community seems to be far easier to build as well.

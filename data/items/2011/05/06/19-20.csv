I honor all the exceptions in the standard/platform libraries. But I see past the hype for my own interfaces. Imho, 9/10 exception classes clutter the interface. 9/10 (again for high reliability, high quality code that you want to work reliably but also be flexible enough to extend), what you want to return is a boolean (and log) for stateful methods. Meanwhile prefer stateless methods wherever possible. And generally speaking treating the JVM and Java as basically a really really high performant scripting engine (i.e., closer to JS than C; though the syntax is somewhere in between). Imho, if you can't do RAII, and you're not deterministic, you are basically a scripting language (or are in the GC family of languages, if you don't like the term 'scripting' -- I think it's cool...).<p>Anyway, that's how I approach it. But I don't buy into the hype of exceptions most of the time (though of course I honor whatever contract other libraries use).",1304711509

It was just made more fine grained, and separated from the markup.<p>For example, the much hated ""float/clear"" layout model were based on the align=""left|right"" and clear=""left|right"" attributes which Netscape (I believe) introduce on img- and table-elements, and which people did use a lot. The layout model of tables were also widely used, and that was codified with the display:table-* properties, which again provides exactly the same layout model in CSS as tables provided via markup.<p>The problem was basically that IE development were frozen for many years. IE implemented the float-related CSS before the freeze, but not the table-model. I believe IE 8 were the first version of IE to support the table model, more than a decade after CSS2 became a recommendation.<p>This resulted in period of many years where the float model were supported via CSS in most browsers, but the table-model were not. This in turn resulted in an amazing amount of confusion, and people believing that floats are somehow the CSS's substitute for tables.",1304710622

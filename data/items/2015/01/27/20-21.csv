Though, as I noted, nobody expects that ideal to pan out.<p>Reality applied to many large organizations to the prospect that things may break on an upgrade translates to &quot;don&#x27;t upgrade.&quot;<p>And really, this isn&#x27;t necessarily bad.  So long as what isn&#x27;t getting upgraded has been compartmentalized and does its job correctly.  Consider, we don&#x27;t even think about asking companies to upgrade processors on a yearly basis.

In some cases, the government mandates that companies pay for work-life benefits, but provides no funding to support them. If you are a large, stable company with predictable revenue, this may be ok. If you are a small company or a startup without significant outside investment, it is a different matter entirely.<p>The question of parental leave is easy when the government picks up the bill and that society as a whole has agreed to subsidize child production.",1422392135

When I was in college a few years ago, I left my door unlocked for a period of months, because I had lost my keys, but replacing keys required a fee (increasing every time) and was generally a cumbersome process.  I suppose an easy solution would be to not have an obnoxious fee, but if I had had a Lockitron, I could have just used my phone, and if I lost my phone (which, of course, has a remote GPS function), I could have switched to a new one.<p>A different use case: over New Year&#x27;s I was on a trip to Germany, working with some friends in a hackerspace there.  Since it was a private space (and open at all hours), the door was not kept unlocked, but a relatively large number of people had access to it.  The hackerspace could have handed out keys, or used some more complicated keycard system, but instead they used a Lockitron-like device (not sure which one; it being a hackerspace, they were managing the lock over SSH!).

Given the political resistance to high immigration rates most places, that&#x27;s not likely to fly.<p>The &quot;payoff&quot; of holding back of maternity leave to limit reproduction rates would also be minimal because the countries with good maternity leave for the most part have a low enough reproduction rate that budging it some small percentage rate further down would not really do much.<p>More and more countries are making the transition to low reproduction rates, and if it continues we will eventually be in a situation where population decline will be the major problem.",1422391416

However, the main reason I personally use inline asm is not for performance, but to access instructions which are not provided as intrinsics or require special register handling.  For example, I recently wrote some code that did syscalls directly (because it was patching memory so the normal syscall functions might not be accessible); I could have linked a separate .S file, but inline assembly made the output look much nicer.  Or, while I haven&#x27;t written this myself, it can be used to write out nops which zero-cost tracing facilities will then patch, something which separate assembly files cannot do.<p>As for effort from compiler authors, I&#x27;d like to hear more about why it is supposedly so hard.

A portion of the gender pay gap, especially in tech, is due to employer perception that hiring women who might have children is risky.<p>Federal law already allows employers to charge their employees higher health insurance rates if they are smokers [1]. And why not? Employers have an incentive to do this because they are required by law to provide health insurance to their full time workers (if they have > 50 employees, anyway). If you are paying for a significant portion of someone&#x27;s healthcare, and they are making voluntary choices which will cost you more money, any kind of working market will lead to increased healthcare costs in such a situation.<p>Childcare, as you mentioned, is usually a voluntary decision. Maybe, as a society, we decide that we want to subsidize procreation as is done in many European countries and have the government foot the bill for parental leave, but if we decide to leave it up to employers (who don&#x27;t care if you have kids or not) we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if parental leave is lacking.<p>The entire U.S. health and insurance system (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;market&quot;) is rotten to the core. The bulk of the costs are typically paid by employers, so employers--whose incentives most definitely do not serve their employees&#x27; health--get to set the policies under which an individual&#x27;s healthcare may be provided. It&#x27;s absurd.<p>The only two sensible systems are a completely individualized system with no employers as middlemen, or a completely socialized one where the government accepts ultimate responsibility (and therefore control) for the health of the people.

Interestingly, this implies that the more enjoyment you get from your own children, the less you should support subsidies for childbearing. Another interesting angle would be to say that most of the benefit clearly flows toward the child themselves (over their lifetime), so the best solution would be a large, universal subsidy, coupled with a per-person tax (independent of income, etc.) so that every person pays for their own birth and childrearing.

At this juncture in space/time, what is the &quot;real world&quot; that is contrasted with video games? As you stated, various forms of consumption, work, social media, in general, essentially, scripted interactions between groups of people-- family members, friends-- comprise the bulk of &quot;real world&quot; experience.<p>Can lifestyle choices be destructive? Absolutely. But most of the perceived destruction arises from the delusion that one has more time available than one actually has, and makes false promises across various domains (for example, to a family member, and a boss, and a WoW clan leader). In a sense, life is being rapidly fractalized.<p>At the risk of sounding cynical, most family interactions revolve around the television anyway (i.e. an average American watches approximately 5 hours of television a day). Together with an 8 hour work day, plus prep time, bathroom time, meal time, transit time, that leaves very little time for &#x27;authentic&#x27; interaction. One could say, if you upset your family, because you play video games, or sit in front of a computer for long periods of time, it, more or less, means that you didn&#x27;t watch television with them.<p>The tragical quotes (like some mentioned in the article), along the lines of &quot;if I hadn&#x27;t spend so much time with x, I could have spent more time with y&quot;, often arise in moments of introspection (which frequently tend toward the depressive, by the very nature of introspection, or at least by what spurred us to introspect), or during a period of grieving after the loss of a loved one that manifests as regret or as an overly-romanticized view of a fictitious past that might have been, and often the regret would have emerged regardless of what the x or y was, due to the finite and possibly Kierkegaardean nature of being a human being.",1422390380

A &quot;best&quot; UI designer is a function of experience: having designed more apps and having more experience, they are likely to make fewer mistakes, and come up with more refined interactions, and more usable new interactions, in the same amount of time.  &quot;Best&quot; may also characterize how they are able to interact with a development team, such as having better estimates or a more professional working style.<p>These designers know they did good work because they conducted, or at least received feedback from, their users in usability tests, comprehension tests, etc.  They did not rely solely on whether their client or employer continued to pay them for their work.  Almost no-one publishes their UI test results, so there&#x27;s no way you can find someone just by looking around, or even asking around.  So all you have to go by, publicly, is the people who talk the loudest about design.<p>The only way to find a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;best&quot; UI designer is to look at well-designed applications on your platform that target your same users, and find out who did the design work.

They quickly locked up the market, injected their own lobbyists into Washington, and then were content to provide a poor service for a lot of money.<p>What is shaking them out of their complacency now is not &quot;the market&quot; or &quot;competition&quot; as it&#x27;s usually understood. It&#x27;s a very large company, with tons of cash, led by someone (Larry Page) with goals beyond pure financial gains and rock-bottom self-interest.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board, and figure out what&#x27;s wrong with these purely mechanistic models of society and the markets. It seems like it&#x27;s time to ask ourselves if a dose of self-<i>less</i>-ness is perhaps required to make the whole system work better. Not a very large dose, mind you, but just a little bit; anything over the current level of zero, really.",1422390156

Most students don&#x27;t care about their work. Most students seem to be unable to follow basic instructions. I go out of my way to help students if they care and stay late at labs for these students, but I have no patience for wasting my time because someone wants to show off and deliberately make my life harder. As is, when I&#x27;m being paid for 6hrs of lab + marking/week, and I am already spending 8+hrs a week because students can&#x27;t format their assignments properly, don&#x27;t write in complete sentences, etc, I have zero interest in patting this guy on the back. Instead, I have to do more work for no pay so he can feel clever.",1422388808

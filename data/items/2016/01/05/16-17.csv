Yes, you can use hardware accelerated boxes to speed up things like SSL termination and HTTP compression, but they&#x27;re not required. Two alternatives:<p>1) IPVS with DSR. You&#x27;ll get about 1M PPS through each &quot;load balancer&quot;. Regular, cheap Linux boxes do well here. You can get fancier here, but a pair of these would scale most games just getting started.<p>2) Run a dispatch server. This is what we used in MSN Messenger. I&#x27;m not going to go too deep into the details, but the gist of it is that we had two groups of user facing servers: connection servers (CS) and dispatch servers (DP). Connection servers is where your client TCP connection terminated and was responsible for updates to your client. The DP server merely &quot;dispatched&quot; you to a CS upon initial client connect. The DP had no role other than seeing which CS servers were alive and sending you to one of the least loaded. The CS servers advertised their existence and load on a multicast address. Yeah, we had a hardware load balancer in front of the DP servers, but we very easily could have used a software implementation. We were part of Hotmail so there was loads of networking hardware to use.<p>Client -> Cisco CSM -> DP server -> redirect to CS -> CS<p>After that, the CSM and DP server were out of the loop and everything went to/from the CS directly. Might not be super elegant, but it worked really well.",1452013157

This doesn&#x27;t mean that you <i>have</i> to abuse monopoly powers to profit; you can simply be better (faster to innovate or spot opportunities) than your competition (until they catch up).",1452013154

Some supported only one of these gateways, other platforms I&#x27;ve been heavily involved with support each of those 4 gateways in parallel depending on their merchants&#x27; needs.<p>Stripe wins, hands-down, for the best documentation and well-thought-out API architecture. It&#x27;s not even fair to call it a race, they&#x27;re so far ahead. Braintree has caught up a fair bit over the years, but they&#x27;re still nowhere near Stripe&#x27;s level, and now that they&#x27;re owned by PayPal I don&#x27;t really expect them to ever get there. (As an aside, I also had a pretty frustrating experience with Braintree back in the day because they took too long to support card tokenization, and one client had no feasible way to only charge the customer once inventory was secured. Lame customer experience.)<p>WePay is doing some cool stuff, but, as one example, their ruby SDK gem is a 100-line thin wrapper around the core Net::HTTP library, which means I have to dig pretty heavily into both their documentation and Ruby&#x27;s various Net::HTTP exceptions to safely handle errors, whereas Stripe has all of this built into their ruby gem out of the box.<p>My time is limited, and I&#x27;d much rather invest it towards designing great customer experiences than reading and understanding lacking documentation. Stripe is the only platform I&#x27;ve seen that gets that their documentation is their product. If the price is I&#x27;m on an over-hyped platform, I&#x27;m okay with that. :)",1452012933

There were millions of calls indeed, but a good chunk of those were pushed by Google and Wikipedia on their home page, so I think he&#x27;s at least half right about that.<p>If you ask me, I think only two things can change the way the US is right now:<p>1) a more democratic and representative voting system (IRV/RCV seems good enough for mayors/governors/presidents, and multi-winner RCV/STV for Congress (as well as local councils, etc) would also fix the gerrymandering problem which is a huge issue on its own with American politics and would provide a more representative multi-party government - the end of the two-party system, in other words).<p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/23/lets-move-beyond-winner-take-all-elections/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/23/...</a><p>As long as the US has the FPTP voting system, people will keep voting for the &quot;Lesser Evil&quot;, because they &quot;don&#x27;t want Mr. Evil&quot; to win (whoever that may be). That&#x27;s just a <i>terrible</i> way of electing someone democratically. People should have a system that <i>makes them</i> vote with the candidate they like most. Anything else should be thrown out. The FPTP is also what will help Republicans keep winning a <i>majority</i> in Congress with only 40% of the votes, as it tends to happen wherever FPTP exists. Also a terrible way of having a &quot;representative democracy&quot; (even if every now and then it will be the Democrats that will win 51% with 40% support).<p>2) campaign finance reform (time to end or at least <i>equalize</i> the &quot;money vote&quot;, which right now greatly <i>skews</i> the &quot;voting power&quot; in the favor of those with the most money. The vote is supposed to be &quot;equal&quot;, but the &quot;money vote&quot; is a sort of parallel voting system that skews who can win and who the winners listen to. Not very democratic at all).<p>I&#x27;m not sure which is more important, but I think the first one could pass more easily, and then over a period of years, people can start electing more representative candidates despite the money the &quot;establishment&quot; candidates will receive. And then those more representative candidates can start supporting changing the campaign finance system as well.<p>These two changes in the end should be enough to put the US on a more democratic path once again, and act as a catalyst to fix many other political issues, too, whether it&#x27;s social issues, immigration issues, health issues, copyright issues, and so on.<p>There&#x27;s only one candidate that supports changing the voting system (to IRV/RCV) right now (as well as real campaign finance reform), and that&#x27;s Bernie Sanders (just FYI).",1452012720

Reordering operations so a value remains in registers is desirable, even if an out-of-bounds write would otherwise have had the side-effect of changing the value.<p>The problem (in this context) is limited to optimizations that reason that the value of the read is &quot;undefined&quot; (as opposed to &quot;implementation defined&quot;), and that the compiler no longer has any obligation to be faithful to the source code for any actions that follow.<p>For example (conceptual rather than exact) if I set all the bits in a region to 1&#x27;s, and then somehow manage to write an unaligned load from within this region, I do not want the compiler to reason that this  value is undefined and that all consequent code can be ignored.<p>I&#x27;m fine with a compile time error, and I&#x27;m fine with generating assembly that attempts the load and uses the result.  Getting SIGBUS for the load on some processors is perfectly acceptable.  I&#x27;d probably even be OK with skipping the load and using a constant, although I&#x27;d hope this would at least be accompanied by a warning message.<p>What I don&#x27;t want is for the compiler to silently omit the load and all the rest of the code within that function on the theory that once undefined behavior has been encountered it no longer has any obligations, not even the obligation to inform the programmer that it has perversely optimized the function to nothingness.<p>(And while most of the lack of clarity is probably my own fault, I do now realize that I was being thrown off by an unfortunate typo in the original post:  presumably he meant for the second argument to be a &#x27;float *&#x27; rather than a &#x27;float&#x27;.

The premise is, basically, &quot;inequality has bad CAUSES, but startups and technology are never one of them.&quot;\nOnly at the end does he hint at what I believe to be the more accurate analysis: AUTOMATION and OUTSOURCING lowers demand for expensive human labor, therefore reducing one of the main ways that money trickles down to the middle and lower class. The better and more widespread the technology, the more I can\n1) Outsource jobs to regions with a lower cost of living, leading to two losses of trickle-down:\n1a) local workers don&#x27;t get the job, and the money goes to someone in another country\n1b) either way my company writes the expenses off its taxable income, but my country doesn&#x27;t get the tax $$ from the worker&#x27;s income to spend on social programs, safety nets etc.\nThis by itself is fine, unless you&#x27;re a nationalist, because it helps reduce poverty where people are poorer, which is outside your country. However, technology also enables:\n2) AUTOMATION, which means I now reduce the amount of HUMAN workers, and once again it has two aspects:\n2a) Now, the demand for human labor drops, and since the supply of workers remains the same, their average wages drop.\n2b) The worst one: monopolies with server farms, contracts of adhesion, and all the power. Like Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Uber, etc. extracting rents from users and providers, until open source disrupts them.\nBy commoditizing the providers and workers, they get squeezed. See Amazon&#x27;s dealings with wage slaves, and its tactics with publishers (middlemen which it eliminates). But those same workers are also supposed to be spending money back into the economy on things they need.\nIt takes time to invent new industries and educate everyone, there is no guarantee that will happen forever, and there is no guarantee that demand shocks for labor won&#x27;t be severe. So, there should probably be unconditional basic income, negative tax or some other scheme for people to KEEP BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE BASICS even if they face no prospects of making money, which a growing unemployed class will.\nOn the bright side, automation will help wean countries from their dependence on an ever-growing population to fund social security schemes. Endless population growth is unsustainable, and countries are currently worried about birth rates mainly because of that. So in a global sense, the solution is: tax the gains from automation, redistribute the proceeds, use condoms.",1452012415
10844207,comment,10841761,10843188,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"> ...I&#x27;ll simply start taking days off without pay, which is something payroll seems to really hate for some reason when it concerns salaried folks.<p>At the risk of sounding too glib, the short answer to why they hate it is it creates work for them. In the US, all of the major payroll processing services are geared towards either hourly or salaried templates. Most companies&#x27; payroll procedures are built around the core assumption that if you are salaried, then it is X salary divided across N weeks/months/your-pay-period. If you take days off without pay, changing the salary, someone in payroll has to manually key in the delta off your normal pay period processing numbers. That sometimes has downstream ramifications upon unemployment insurance reporting and remittance, for larger companies there are other regulatory-originated reporting that this can impact, and put in common issues like tax liens and family court-mandated levies, just for starters, and it gets hairy. Generally payroll processing is still built around a set of assumptions that are at odds with emerging knowledge workforce trends; the trends can be accommodated, but it&#x27;s a hassle.<p>If you have a good enough relationship with your manager, then you are far better off negotiating a sub-rosa agreement to (in your example) work Wednesday this week and take off a couple days next week (or leave a couple hours earlier each day), and net out to zero change in time worked over a short (sub-month) period and leaving payroll none the wiser to any change in time worked, than making the payroll department perform an exception-based processing of your payroll.<p>US payroll processing trivia to illustrate how rigid payroll processing systems are today for the small business, and for flexible work arrangements: if you are a really small, micro-sized business, like say an Etsy seller with a couple full-time employees, set up as your own LLC or whatever, you will run payroll, except unlike larger businesses you will frequently want to know how much to pay yourself (after paying off all employees and vendors) including all employER-side tax liabilities, and not just the employEE-side disbursement. All of the top-ten payroll processors have no capability to compute that for you; you have to iterate to an approximation. In other words, if you know you can afford to pay yourself only $10K total this month, payroll processors force you to key in a employEE net pay number then they spit out the gross including the employER side, and only then do you see if you are over/under the $10K amount. There is no feature that lets a small business owner say, this pay period, I can only afford at most $X cash out the door total including all tax liabilities for so-and-so employee, iterate and solve for me what the best result is to achieve that.<p>US payroll processing can get really complex, really fast even for small businesses, so I can imagine what a nightmare it must be for the designers and developers of those systems. However, I believe there is still plenty of room for someone to create a disruptive service that caters to and appeals to small businesses.",1452012415

It was written in 1887 but could have been written yesterday.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Backward"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Backward</a><p>It was basically about a guy who accidentally travels forward in time (sort of like idiocracy) except he finds himself in an American Socialist Utopia. It was a really good book in general but there was one idea in particular that the author had, which seems pertinent here.<p>Essentially in this utopia everyone gets the same pay check and the opportunity to work. Instead of getting paid more money for a demanding job you get &quot;paid&quot; in less hours. Meaning, all jobs start out at, say 40 hours per week. A job that doesn&#x27;t get any applicants would decrease the number of hours it demands and correspondingly, the number of open positions would increase. Eventually an unappealing job would decline to a number of hours where someone would be willing to do it.<p>For example, that coal mining job that nobody wants to do? Well it pays the same as every other job but you only need to do it for 4 hours a week. You can work more of course if you want but you get the same paycheck. The rest of that time you can do whatever you want, spend time with your family or do art or whatever.<p>Also, in For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs by Robert A. Heinlein there are some very interesting ideas about American social economics, including a social credit system. Which I believe is a pretty old fashioned idea that we have almost completely forgot about.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Us,_The_Living:_A_Comedy_of_Customs#Economic_independence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Us,_The_Living:_A_Comedy_o...</a><p>This constant back and forth about work hours and minimum wage and the inexorable pull towards wage slavery makes me think its time to explore some completely lateral options.",1452010604

As someone with a background in philosophy, philosophical tutelage can&#x27;t really begin until someone is at a college age and a college maturity, at least with the American understanding of maturity. I assume that if the school system were completely destroyed then rebuilt with critical thinking at its core rather than obedience and conformity, it would be possible to have more mature students who could handle learning philosophy in high school.<p>High schools do in fact serve to create bare minimum interchangeable peons who are not mentally competent to apply critical thinking or analysis. Forcing a philosophy class into the curriculum won&#x27;t change the fact that it won&#x27;t be taught correctly, as the emphasis is on sitting still in the seat and turning in homework rather than genuine contemplation and forming of a cognitive capacity.<p>With that being said: our population needs a massive boost in thinking ability, so something&#x27;s gotta give.

A very common source for security vulnerabilities as well, pretty large portion of them are related to string processing.<p>I understand. I think the gross majority of this comes from the C standard library though, and <i>not</i> from the C language.<p>qmail for example had no buffer overflow problems -- the first security vulnerabilities found 10 years after release wouldn&#x27;t affect any system that qmail was developed to run on simply because nobody gave their mail server 4GB of ram! Surely the author should have predicted this problem, but it demonstrates methodology can protect against this issue.<p>KDB takes an interesting approach of reference counting in all operators. Operators can then be optimised for situations where one argument (or both) have a reference-count of exactly one. This means writing C code with KDB&#x27;s memory management library can make things very simple.<p>Antirez also has an interesting string library that uses a combination of length+null-termination specifically for the purpose of finding bugs.<p>> There&#x27;s just no way around it. I do want to delegate things to other people. Defensive coding tends to catch and prevent a lot of mistakes at that point. Many of them have pretty cowboy attitudes towards details such as parameter validation or error checking. Some of them will need to maintain it in the distant future.<p>I understand what you&#x27;re saying, but I think technique can help a lot more than we think: Most of the software engineering industry wants to move to smarter and better tooling, and I&#x27;m just proposing we upgrade our brains some too.<p>I don&#x27;t have all the answers yet.<p>> You&#x27;re not going to put 300GB string in any standard string abstraction.<p>In KDB this is actually pretty common, but it doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;standard string abstraction&quot; because while it meaningfully supports byte-arrays that are in the 300GB range, the string-atoms (symbols) which are used similar to strings in python et al, never approach 1MB let alone 300GB.<p>However in C I just did mmap() and updated the file.

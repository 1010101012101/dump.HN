3140883,comment,3128480,3129018,1,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Drew came to PG with a lot of good work done.  As is common in VC, at least for funding from YC, PG said that Drew needed a 'cofounder'.<p>PG in his<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a><p>gives 18 reasons a startup might fail with the first reason ""Single Founder"".  Moreover, a 'single founder' is frowned on elsewhere in VC.<p>So, we have claims that projects with single founders are somehow inferior, to be frowned upon, to be avoided, not to be funded, etc.  On these claims I call BS.<p>Instead, given a project, typically much more information is available for evaluation so that with that extra information 'single founder' should commonly be from a strong advantage to nearly neutral to a strong disadvantage.  Net, by itself, 'single founder' says next to nothing important.  So, I claim that automatically saying there is something seriously wrong with a single founder project is BS.<p>There are some dangers in having a cofounder:  Likely the most important danger is that cofounders can get into fights.  Another danger, broadly, is the one the US Navy recognizes:  On a ship, there is exactly one Captain.  So, in particular, the ship doesn't continue without good direction while 'co-captains' argue about the direction.<p>In<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3129873"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3129873</a><p>0x12 says<p>""The upside (and it's a huge upside)<p><pre><code>  - you don't have to deal with your co-founders""
</code></pre>
I agree.<p>In<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3128876"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3128876</a><p>staunch asked<p>""What if Arash had turned out to be a bad match?  They didn't know each other, so it was a pretty big gamble.""<p>I agree.<p>PG answered stauch with in part:<p>""Oddly enough Drew and I talked about this question tonight on a panel at the Computer History Museum.  It was a big risk to recruit someone as a cofounder that he didn't know before (and I've seen a lot of cases where it didn't work out) but in this case the risk was mitigated by how much they had in common.""<p>So here PG recognizes ""a big risk"".  So, it is widely recognized that having a cofounder is risky.<p>For the ""mitigated"", I can't take that very seriously.  Instead, For Drew to take on a cofounder so quickly was still risky.<p>Let's examine this issue of risk in more detail:  Why accept the risk?<p>One claimed reason for accepting the risk is that a single founder may lack 'psychological stability and self-discipline' and, thus, go wacko, make bad decisions, get discouraged, give up on the company, go for fast women, slow horses, cheap booze, and suffer ""the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to"".  He might.  Yet he might not.<p>So, in short, such reasons are claiming that a person working nearly alone essentially under just their own direction and motivation with their own ideas is likely doomed.<p>Let's examine this claim; is a person working alone essentially doomed from various 'psychological' issues?<p>First, let's consider the case of nearly anyone who, during the years they are working, is by a wide margin the best in the world at what they are doing.  So, by being so good in their work, they really can't have a 'partner' or 'coworker' to share the crucial parts of the work.  That is, being the best in the world is not a pairs competition, partnership, joint work, group activity, or team sport.  Or, as is often said, ""It's lonely at the top."".  So people who are the best in the world at what they do are essentially necessarily working alone but are definitely not ""doomed"".<p>Second, for some examples, consider some world famous people in the arts, Michelangelo, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky.  Also in musical performance consider Heifetz, Rostropovich, Horowitz.  And in the sciences consider Newton, Maxwell, Einstein.  In each case, they worked essentially alone.  E.g., consider Bach and compare his music with that of any of his children; the children were hardly up to copying Dad's manuscripts.  These people were working essentially alone but definitely were not ""doomed"".<p>Are there any successful startups by a single founder?  Sure:  FedEx.  While I don't know the fine details of the early days at Oracle, a guess is that Ellison was a sole founder there.  Viterbi may have been a sole founder at QUALCOMM.  We certainly have to count Dell.  HotMail?  Lotus?  So, these sole founders in business were not doomed.<p>But there are millions more:  Just pick a Main Street anywhere in the US, border to border.  There will find millions of successful entrepreneurs running 'sole proprietorships' and doing all the important work themselves.  Will find such people running restaurants, big truck-little truck operations, gas stations, auto body shops, auto repair shops, doing kitchen renovation, dentistry, tax accounting, family law, various trades, and more.  Then outside of town, look at farmers growing fruits, vegetables, grains, raising poultry, dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, etc.  These people usually are not in high margin, high growth, high potential businesses, but they are often 'sole proprietors' and are certainly not doomed.<p>For more, in business, is a coworker important or can one guy hope really to do the work essentially alone?  I suggest considering Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet.  Did they do IT startups always alone?  No.  But in the world class work they did, and/or are doing, they did it alone or nearly so.  So, working without a coworker is not doomed.<p>For the more narrow activity of IT startups, especially for Web 2.0, can a sole founder really do all the crucial work himself or is he doomed?  I claim that now he can expect to do all the crucial work and, indeed, has one heck of an advantage over a 'team'.<p>For the advantage, he won't get into fights with a cofounder, won't have his best work diluted by compromising with a cofounder, and won't have to spend the time convincing, communicating with, or coordinating with a cofounder.<p>For being able to get the work done, there have been some revolutions in the foundation 'resources' of IT from Moore's law, the similar law for disk space, optical fibers for digital communications, and infrastructure software, say, based on Linux or Windows.  So, the founder can be the chief programmer on his 'chief programmer team' and also the whole team except for, say, some occasional very focused technical support from Internet fora, Microsoft, Cisco, HP, etc.  The CEO of a startup really should know all the work of his company like the back of his hand; basically the way for him to do this is just to do the work himself.<p>When should a VC set aside a project from a single founder?<p>(1) The founder should have some good work to show and, otherwise, a VC should 'set aside'.  (2) The founder should appear to be able to get the rest of the work done through a company big enough really to need to hire.  So, the founder should be able to (a) give a good pitch to the VCs, (b) show the good work to date, (c) have solid plans for the next steps, (d) clearly be able to work with his lawyer, bookkeeper, tax accountant, recruiting firm, office landlord, and paying customers, and (e) manage at least a few people before it is time to get him, say, a COO.  (3) The founder should not have any obvious disqualifications.<p>If these criteria (1)-(3) are met, then a sole founder stands to be a better bet than a 'team'.",1319219868

It depends on there being no <i>initial</i> salt.  All further iterations of sha1 can be salt free and still safe from this attack since you are not able to feed an arbitrary string into the key function.<p>Edit: Thinking about it I should be more specific, especially since I got confused myself for a moment.  The key is that you don't salt the same way at each step.  So a unique salt per iteration is great, salting the first iteration is fine, salting zero or all iterations with a particular salt ruins you.",1319219662

        X  H (X  Vj )

    N times; and output X.

The function Integerify can be any bijection from {0, 1}^k to {0...2^k 1}.<p>Theorem:<p>Under the random oracle model, the class of functions ROMix are sequential memory-hard.<p>More intuitively,<p><pre><code>    V_0 = H(B)

    X = V_N = H(H( ... H(B) ...) )

V_i are filled with pseudo random values.<p>Then the algorithm access them in pseudo random order.<p>Which means that is is not only very long to compute but also need a lot of memory.<p>Now zealot should say _use scrypt_! not bcrypt.

Did you read it?<p><i>Or do you think that the particular set of 2^N (assuming no redundancy, which is generous...) neural algorithms that N bits of DNA can encode are more likely to result in intelligence than a random sampling of algorithms of equivalent Kolmogorov complexity?</i><p>I am not sure I understand the question. Are you asking if I believe the brain is a large but mostly simply designed neural network? If that is the question, then no.<p><i>Or are you claiming that epigenetic factors are able to reliably transmit significantly more than N bits of mission-critical data across the generations</i><p>I am claiming that do get a human you must ""host"" the human genome in a pre-existing human. Sticking it in a mouse will not result in a human. What does that imply?<p><i>that epigenetic evolution is likely to thank for devising the human intelligence algorithm rather than evolution of DNA?</i><p>I don't see two kind of evolutions there. It's all just human evolution genome and all. After all, it's not like human dna is out there evolving in something else besides humans.<p><i>In humans the difference is muddled because the spec goes through such ridiculously complicated machinery to become the product</i><p>Yes!<p><i>but when it comes to designing algorithms, that complicated machinery might as well be a random shuffle for all it matters to the algorithm's proper functioning</i><p>What implies that? How do you go form yes a hugely complex compiler is necessary, to no we can just randomly shuffle the code and it'll be just as good?<p>How many bits does it take to describe the string ""aaaaaaa""? Not many. How many bits to describe the human genome to a scientist? I'll just gzip it and email it and were done, awesome!<p>How many bits to describe a human brain or how to turn that genome into a human brain? Well lets see, its a complex self-modifying process, the human brain expands the number of sequence products <i>exponentially</i> and interestingly the mouse brain does not do this.<p>In mice the complexity difference between their brain and their genome is linear. In humans it is not.<p>In mice the Kolmogorov complexity of their brain is equal to the Kolmogorov complexity of their genome + some linear factor.<p>In humans it's the Kolmogorov complexity of our genome + a lot more.<p>How much is ""a lot more""? No idea.<p>Is all of this inherited? Yes, partly through the genome, partly through the fact that that genome must be planted in a pre-existing human. Again, if you swap it out with a mice genome humans won't be giving birth to healthy mice and mice won't be producing humans.<p>You can move a simple sequence across species, like a glowing protein form jellyfish to rabbits for example. You can not move whole genomes in higher order life forms.<p>I think the disagreement between early and late singularity people often comes down to is the human brain mostly a large but simple mass of neurons or not.<p>I think computer scientist are often in the it's just a large neural network camp. Brain scientists are in the it's much more complicated than that camp. As a computer scientist and software engineer who's worked in biotech for many years, I agree with the brain scientists.",1319217076

Within a manifest inside it, you can specify a ""target"" release API version and a ""minimum"" version. No one running a device below the minimum can see or install your apk. The target one is more of a suggestion to the Dalvik VM  with how to approach running your application (if it know you're targeting the latest release, it can expect you to use some new features and adjust accordingly, etc).<p>Just like with web sites, you progressively enhance an Android app during development using Java's reflection, and/or gracefully degrade by bundling up back-ported modules and UI components in your apk. If you absolutely can't get around a particular function not being present in an old version of the API, then you just don't have that feature even visible to the end-user.<p>The current recommendation is to set your min level to 7 (which is Android 2.1), and as of a few days ago, to set your target to 14 (Android 4.0, or Ice Cream Sandwich). According to raw statistics of devices active and in the wild, this hits 97% of all potential Android customers. Fragmentation used to be an issue back when supporting the Android 1.x line of APIs was still necessary. Now it's nice and streamlined, and I barely notice writing for compatibility any more.<p>And if you really can't get around some problems, the Market now lets you upload multiple apks for a single ""release"" of your app, each targeted towards different ranges of API levels.",1319217048

Here the attack they want to mount is the following: find another string, ANY string, that will hash to the same output, but only 32 bits of the output.<p>Since it is any string, it can also be a SHA1 itself. So what you do is to start with an ""X"" that can be ANY ANY value, even ""foo"". And you start doing:<p><pre><code>    x = SHA1(x)
    x = SHA1(x)
    ... again and again ...
</code></pre>
right? Well in the average case after 2^31 iterations you find a collision, right?<p>But the output 65536 iterations ago was it! The string that will output that specific 32 bit output after SHA1() nested 65536 times. So you want to go backward but it is not possible, SHA1 can't be inverted.<p>So what you do? You start again from ""X"" and stop exactly 65536 iterations before you found the wanted value.<p>Obviously doing 65536 more SHA1s of that string you get the previous output. So you found your string.<p>Why the original poster says that the attack takes 2x time but can even optimized? Since you can store the value of SHA1 at 10000 iterations, at 20000 and so forth. Then instead of re-running the iteration again you start from the nearest cached value.<p>Is it clear now? Otherwise please ask me and I'll be willing to help.<p>Edit: do you see that chat? This is the dogmatic approach we don't need. gcp found a random message on sci.crypt, and it used it as an universal proof that nested SHA1 is wrong (well he said ""likely"" actually).

(Although this conflicts with our intuition about our own consciousness.) What that means is that if we were to have the position and velocity of every particle at a given moment in time we could (in principle) calculate the position and velocity for any future moment.  The important thing is that the known and understood physical ""stuff"" is just particles, and the only thing that can or need be known about them is their position and velocity.  There is no thing-which-is-NOT-made-of-particles which we might call a soul or whatever.<p>In particular, you could in-principle predict what experimental subject Bob would chose based on the configuration of the particles in the universe <i>before he was born</i>.<p>So, is your question ""How is that pre-Bob configuration of particles causing Bob's choice?""  If so, then you just look to the fundamental laws of classical physics: particles obey certain rules which govern how they move around.  Given a certain pre-Bob configuration, we would compute that the particles would all follow certain trajectories which eventually would lead to a configuration where many particles were assembled into Bob himself, and these particles moved in such a way (according to known physics) that Bob (who is composed of the particles) made a certain choice.<p>Or is your question about quantum mechanics?",1319216824

We need greater resources to ensure that we continue to service our customers and execute on our roadmap and vision.<p>As part of this process we engaged outside help and took a long hard look at our pricing, customers requirements, goals and the marketplace. Together, we realized that our pricing was unsustainable. Simply put, our pricing didn't reflect the true costs of building, enhancing and maintaining a world-class payment platform for our customers. We have therefore adjusted our pricing  we've raised it across the board. To learn more visit our updated pricing page on spreedly.com. Our new prices will come into effect on your next renewal on or after November 15th.<p>We understand that nobody likes to see a pricing increase. That said, we hope you can understand the trade off  you want a financially secure, well-resourced provider that's improving the service on a regular basis. We are keenly aware that we're a critical part of your revenue stream so you need us to do well and stay competitive. However, if for any reason you are unhappy about the change we understand that too. We want happy customers not hostages! Email us at sales@spreedly.com and we'll grandfather you at the current pricing for up to 90 days so you have time to change to a new provider.<p>Thats it for now. Keep an eye out on our blog and twitter as we continue to update you on our progress.<p>Regards,<p>Nathaniel Talbott

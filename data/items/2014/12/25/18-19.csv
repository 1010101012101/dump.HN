8796886,comment,8796270,8796270,0,0,gpsx,,,"This article does a good job of covering a lot of different ideas on this paradox. I have a problem with the idea of &quot;big numbers&quot; in it though, like where it implies 500 billion billion is nearly infinite, or that one-in-a-billion is a freak occurrence. There is a saying that if enough monkeys pound on a keyboard, one will type Hamlet. This would take a lot of monkeys. If we take the odds of hitting one character to be 1 in 40 (which doesn&#x27;t account for properly hitting the shift key to make a capital), factoring in the 130,000 letters in Hamlet (according to Wikipedia), we get the odds of a monkey typing it at 6x10^208267. This number comes from 40 keys and 130,000 letters. How about when we start taking molecular numbers of items (6x10^23) and start raising that to a large power? I don&#x27;t think it is a given that the number of planets out there infer there should be other life.",1419533941

8796881,comment,8795172,8796724,0,0,Animats,,,"<i>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand this comment.</i>&quot;<p>A content-delivery-network using HTTPS <i>is a MITM.</i> Decryption occurs at the CDN, and everything is in the clear inside the CDN&#x27;s operation. That&#x27;s a good place for interception, lawful and otherwise, because so much can be captured there.<p>It&#x27;s a scaling problem. If you only use HTTPS for crucial items such as logins and credit cards, the load is small enough that you don&#x27;t need a content delivery network for those pages. A small number of high-security machines can handle the important stuff. The non-secure pages can go through a CDN, which can cache them.<p>With HTTPS Everywhere, if you&#x27;re big enough to need a CDN, and use the same CDN for both secure and non-secure pages, you&#x27;ve exposed everyone&#x27;s credentials inside the CDN.  How much do you trust your CDN? Are you feeling lucky?<p>What we really need is less SSL and more page signing. There&#x27;s a W3C proposal for attaching the secure hash of a page to its URL, and validating that in the browser.  That guarantees the page you asked for is the one you get, while allowing caching.  The caching operation can&#x27;t change anything without the browser rejecting it. This catches tampering at the router level, the cache level, and the ISP (we&#x27;re looking at you, Comcast) level.  So you can have the performance gains of distributed caching without the risk of tampering.",1419533769

If the canary gets updated it could be any one of a number of things, one of which is that things are fine. But saying that the canary being updated is the same as you being compelled to lie misses out on a few critical options:<p>- presumably you set the time interval between updates short enough that your key or passphrase could not be compromised in that timeframe, so any interval longer may indicate a compromised private key<p>- it&#x27;s only fine if the canary specs as defined up-front have not been violated (which in this case they have)<p>- canaries <i>may</i> be useless as a concept anyway because lawyers are human and hence fallible.<p>(That last one is a stretch, but with stuff like this it&#x27;s either 1 or 0, not something in between and I don&#x27;t see an iron clad guarantee there, merely an informed opinion.)",1419533701

I was in college during the 90&#x27;s and the changes just in the five years I was there was pretty amazing. Several of my EEE roommates were tried and true hackers, cyberpunks and phreakers. The stuff they showed me just blew me away.<p>So many incredible things happened in the 90&#x27;s. In just three years, I went from using BBS&#x27;s, to scanning newsgroups on distant colleges and downloading entire research papers, to seeing the internet in full bloom. It never occurred to me at the time how fast things were changing, or how so many of us were standing at the threshold of a brave new world.<p>You&#x27;re not getting old and crotchety, you want the same thing I do.

Of course, people like to invoke economic incentives here and say there&#x27;s opportunity cost with the idea that the sidechain will pay ongoing fees or something. But this is a very untested idea to put it charitably - keeping Bitcoin itself secure with only fees is widely considered to be an unsolved problem, and that problem doesn&#x27;t have a reward in the form of a bunch of 2-way-pegged Bitcoins waiting to be stolen.<p>Ultimately I think media coverage of this is really misunderstanding how sidechains are <i>very</i> far from a proven idea, except in the centralized model where you trust someone to maintain the sidechain. Equally it&#x27;s pretty clear that they have a high risk of making the incentives behind Bitcoin mining even further tilted towards centralization of hashing power.",1419532994

When I lived in Mountain View (which is where it is located), it was the one place I would <i>always</i> take any family or friends who were visiting, and they always enjoyed it, no matter how technically inclined they were.<p>Hearing about the technology <i>from the people who built it</i>, is amazing, and it&#x27;s an opportunity we won&#x27;t have much longer in the case of these original systems. The guy who built the first computer game (Space War), and helped restore the PDP/1 on which it runs, presented it on a couple of the occasions when I went there. They have docents that can tell you, with deep personal experience, about the Cray supercomputer, the PDP/1, PDP/8, UNIX, IBM mainframes, etc. But, they&#x27;re all getting up there in age, and many of the founders of our field have passed away in the past couple of decades.<p>As for being spoonfed, I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s true.

There is no reason to assume this is true, given that we know even the more complex building blocks of life are actually very prevalent throughout the universe - but it may still be statistically unlikely that cells form from them.

Campbell-Kelly&#x27;s big complaint seems to be that the early history of computing mentions machines, languages, and algorithms too much, and doesn&#x27;t discuss applications and users enough. That&#x27;s a reasonable comment from a historian.<p>When Knuth wrote Vol. I, &quot;Fundamental Algorithms&quot;, there were almost no computer books published other than manufacturer manuals and a few introductory programming language books. Knuth&#x27;s series is really a history of algorithms, with each one traced back to its originator.  The early history is on the record.<p>We&#x27;re now inundated with corporate histories, mostly of applications companies.  There&#x27;s a glut of CEO biographies.  There are academic papers on the history of the spreadsheet. There&#x27;s no longer a lack of history on the user-facing side.<p>This comes with progress in the field.  A book-length history of the electric motor, from Henry to Edison to Sprague to Tesla and up to modern brushless motors, would be interesting - to a very small number of people.  Popular articles on motors can be found in mainstream publications from 1880 to 1925 or so.  After that, they were just routine items, not newsworthy. Low-level algorithms now belong in that category.  A few people still have to study how to do hash tables, just as a few people have to study rotating electrical machinery theory and design new motors.<p>The important thing is not to lose the history.

While the Coravin-preserved bottle tasted more like the brand-new one, its price makes it impractical for many wine drinkers; it’s better suited for restaurant use, or serious oenophiles. For everyone else, Private Preserve is still the way to go.&quot;<p><a href=""http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-way-to-keep-open-wine-fresh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-way-to-keep-open-wine-f...</a>",1419530745

Why not just use a browser-based js library?<p>I don&#x27;t really care much about i18n and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a library around that does all the stuff mentioned in the post but it am I missing something to assume you could solve this without server roundtrips?",1419530715

Recently a Twitter recruiter contacted me on Linkedin looking for referrals and I sent him my resume, only to be told that they were looking for people with more experience, despite significantly more relevant experience on my resume.<p>Is the BigCo interview process just that arbitrary?",1419530544

If so you could have a soft-limit (think bandwidth-throttling). Or describe the actual limit in language that makes it seem bigger.<p>The business model of &quot;promising&quot; more capacity than you actually have is pretty common, especially with cloud storage provides. To some extent every SaaS does it. As long as you do the math and structure pricing accordingly you&#x27;re fine.",1419530465

That comes from a singular vision that is realized by a community.<p>[1] It&#x27;s hard to provide a succinct definition of taste in a language, but mostly it comes from picking a style of programming and then ruthlessly cutting features which can&#x27;t fit into that style.",1393609778

I suppose I&#x27;m fortunate enough to also agree with the goals of Common Core as they are today.<p>Onto that article, however:<p>1. I never use an academic degree as an indicator of intellectual capacity. I find that some people are so objective-driven that they zoom right past the point and straight to rageville when they don&#x27;t understand something.<p>2. A simple Google search on front-end estimation would have helped this mom realize that the example given on the sheet is incorrect. I will concede that an effective teacher would have realized that the example given is incorrect and would have corrected it.<p>(In front end estimation, you round the leftmost digit, so the example should actually be 400 + 300, not 300 + 200). IMHO 700 is actually a decent estimate for 645, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem with the math itself. It&#x27;s not really feel-good math, but I think some people take for granted that estimation is not an innate ability.<p>Now, it becomes another discussion altogether when the teacher is so horrible that they refuse to accept that the example is wrong. But, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen evidence of that, so I won&#x27;t accuse anyone of anything.<p>EDIT: I just read some of the comments in that article, and it looks like some districts teach front-end estimation with truncation rather than rounding, in which case 300 + 200 = 500 would be correct.<p>Here are a few more things to note: the parents here <i>assume</i> that estimation and rounding are the same thing. That in itself isn&#x27;t true.<p>More importantly, though, look at the <i>goal</i> of the estimation -- to see if the <i>actual</i> answer, 645, is reasonable. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> the same thing as asking if 500 is a reasonable estimate of 645. I think the point of this exercise is for kids to say &quot;ok, if I add these two numbers together, I <i>expect</i> to get a 3-digit number somewhere in the ballpark of 500.&quot; That is to say: if I add 354 and 291, I shouldn&#x27;t expect to get 20000 or 7 or 81 or 9750. It&#x27;s just a simple way of checking your work using a quick, easy method that you can do in your head. Again, I find the value in this -- adding &quot;common sense&quot; to the curriculum is definitely something I can get behind, but I understand that parents who aren&#x27;t used to &quot;common sense on paper&quot; will struggle.",1393608830

Where is the promise to pay?  What is the term of the loan?  Why is the US paying the Fed interest to take and use their note?<p>If it were borrowing, the Treasury would print the notes and give them to the Fed in exchange for something.  Those are T-bills.

I think reddit needs <i>more</i> moderation. I wish mods wouldn&#x27;t be as afraid to lay down the ban-hammer. I think the mods of /r/News were justified in their approach, and that these censorship stories coming out about reddit are due to an ignorance of how reddit works.<p>The mods are fighting a battle against the lowest common denominator and losing. The beauty of reddit is that anyone can create their own subreddit and mod it however they see fit. If you want an easy going subreddit with mods that are hands-off, you&#x27;re free to create one or subscribe to one. If a mod wants to rule their domain with an iron fist, their free to do that too.<p>More importantly, the users are free to subscribe to any subreddit they wish. Users can literally vote with their feet and have done so on more than one occasion. Your proposed overhaul would change that dynamic. It&#x27;s a dynamic which has helped reddit get to the level it&#x27;s at now. People like to believe the collapse of digg contributed to reddit&#x27;s success, but the fact is, (according to google trends), reddit had already surpassed Digg long before the big collapse.",1393607532

They only have value in trade.<p>If I started my own currency called a superdollar, and I had the only superdollar in existence, it would be worthless, despite the fact that it was very rare.<p>If a foreign entity can make the bitcoins you have disappear, that leads to less confidence in your ability to use the bitcoins for trade.  The fact that there&#x27;s fewer out there doesn&#x27;t mean yours are more valuable.  The number of bitcoins has been constantly increasing, yet the price has been going steadily up as well.  That&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve become more trusted, more usable.  More places will accept them in trade, and more exchanges exist.<p>When places like Mt. Gox fail, or fear that foreign entities have the ability to essentially rob the banks with impunity, it makes the currency less trusted.<p>Consider this.  The government issues a currency called digibux.  They are matched to the USD, you can buy one digibuck for 1 USD, but they are limited in volume, only so many are offered.  Looking at this naively, digibux has the same value as USD.  Now consider the following happens, the government takes down a giant drug operation, and invalidates all of the digibux that were involved in the operation.   A friend of yours who was a pizza delivery guy has hundreds of dollars removed from his digital wallet because they were tips from people who had participated in the drug trade.<p>Now you&#x27;re sitting with 10,000 digibux, and you know that the government is pleased with the results of the previous sting and wants to set up more operations like that.  Someone offers you 8,000 USD for your 10,000 digibux.  You know that the 8,000 USD can never just vanish.<p>The number of digibux in circulation went down.  But did that make the total value of digibux go up?",1393607050

Given more time there might be a framework that has everything that I want, informed by comprehensive, mature, real-world use cases, but I haven&#x27;t yet seen anything compelling enough in the dozen or so libraries I&#x27;ve looked at. I&#x27;ve found a lot of value in having granular control so I can explore different conventions and optimizations.",1421956772
8931364,comment,8930320,8931290,0,0,freehunter,,,"Generally the UI is written with one of the two big GUI toolkits: GTK (Gnome) or Qt (KDE). If you run Gnome, you get GTK and all the apps work without needing to download anything else, but if you have Gnome and want an app using the Qt framework, you&#x27;ll need to download the Qt libraries, which can be substantial. Even after downloading the Qt libraries, though, the application might still look weird, since it&#x27;s not a native GTK UI.<p>The state of WMs on Linux is really, really more complicated than it needs to be.",1421956753

8931359,comment,8930633,8930633,0,0,pbiggar,,,"Founder of CircleCI here.  Some notes on this:<p>CircleCI does have free and public Open Source builds: <a href=""http://blog.circleci.com/a-step-into-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.circleci.com/a-step-into-open-source/</a>. We allow you run three concurrent open source builds for free, more than anyone else. Also, we allow larger teams to pay to run more builds, which can be really valuable for large projects.<p>CircleCI is basically built for large teams, for example Shopify: <a href=""https://circleci.com/stories/shopify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circleci.com/stories/shopify</a>. There&#x27;s a few major features that support that. For example, large teams typically have tons of integration/browser tests: we allow you to SSH and VNC into the build to figure out why browser tests are failing. This is a critical feature for large teams.<p>Similarly, parallelism is built into CircleCI from the ground up - we&#x27;ve spent a ton of time making the really simple and automatic. We can automatically split and load-balance test suites across dozens of machines, and we have huge customers using this to reduce multi-hour test suites to run in minutes. This is much more support than anyone else, if it&#x27;s even possible you have to go through a long process to manually enable parallelization.<p>We have support for GitHub Enterprise in our Enterprise product (which you can run in AWS VPC). See <a href=""https://circleci.com/enterprise"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circleci.com/enterprise</a> for details.<p>For small teams, we don&#x27;t actually start at $50 - we start at free. If you&#x27;re less than 5 people, you likely won&#x27;t pay anything to use CircleCI. The free version is fully featured and lets you run 1 build at a time (for $50, you&#x27;ll get a 2nd concurrent build, which you&#x27;ll need as your team grows).<p>There&#x27;s a couple of features that are listed for other products that aren&#x27;t listed for CircleCI - not sure why they aren&#x27;t listed:<p>- Unlimited open source projects with full functionality.\n- Has own headless browser support (albeit Firefox only). [actually, on CircleCI we also support chrome]\n- Allows to cluster tests and run them in parallel.\n- Seamless UI integration with GitHub.<p>Hope that helps! Happy to answer any questions too.",1421956731

8931353,comment,8929380,8929380,0,0,sheepmullet,,,"Like most questions on ask HN the answer is: it depends.<p>Mostly it depends on a) what level of quality you need, b) what are you currently doing for quality control, and c) what other alternatives do you have?<p>On a): What is your customers bug tolerance rate? What part of the codebase is this? Most people will be ok with a few application crashes or a feature not working in some edge cases but be irate if you corrupt their data. Are you just trying to MVP or prove an idea? Is the app going to be around in 10 years etc? Are you building a framework or api that is going to be a building block or a user facing app? Huge difference.<p>On b): If you are already unit testing then that&#x27;s 30-40% of dev time. Add another 10% for integration testing and you are already at basically half the effort being quality control. Add another 25% of total time on top and suddenly you are looking at spending 60%+ of the dev effort on quality control. Is that a good use of time? Depends on a) and c) :).<p>On c): For example perhaps you would be better off getting rid of code review entirely and using the savings to hire dedicated QA people. Or perhaps formal reviews would work better. Or maybe more time on design or talking to your customers. I&#x27;d personally rate all three as more effective.",1421956668

8931339,comment,8930360,8931257,0,0,bokonist,,,"Why do you think that would improve outcomes?<p>From my observation, if someone is smart, they can teach themselves out of a book, with a bit of guidance to keep them on the right track. If someone simply lacks the cognitive power, there is nothing a teacher can do to make them smart. The student can improve somewhat with practice and drilling, but they still plateau at a lower point than the smart student. So we need to spend enough money that their is a guide to help students get through roadblocks, but I see no evidence that we are spending too little to provide appropriate guidance. I think one hour of personal guidance for every 10 to 20 hours of self-practice is a perfectly normal ratio. That is what we do when training new engineers, or learning a musical instrument, and there really isn&#x27;t much of a way to gain more benefit by increasing the quantity of guidance.<p>I think that teaching could be improved somewhat, at the high-end. But it could be done by reallocating existing spending, not spending more. I do think that mentorship helps a lot, but mentorship needs to come from an experienced practitioner. So what we need is a system where a programmer can work a job for a few years, then take a mentoring job for a year, then work for a few years, etc. This would require eliminating the need for education degrees, and optimizing teacher&#x27;s time for personal mentorship rather than grading tests, building lesson plans, and performing classroom management. It really would be an entirely different job than what is now considered a teacher. A &quot;teacher&quot; now is really just a glorified day-care worker, paying them more won&#x27;t help much.",1421956507

I&#x27;m glad you live in a place where you can trust these sorts of fundamental services.  This paper was not written for people like you.<p>Look at something like M-PESA in East Africa. It allows a person to have the equivalent of a bank account and transact with others without having any form of state recognised identity - only a mobile phone. That this is so successful is largely as a result of the complete inadequacy of the local banking system and the regional governments&#x27; inability to provide meaningful identity to their citizens.<p>Consider vaccination programs. Aid agencies responding to the Haiti earthquake in 2010 struggled to place young children back with their parents because no-one carried identity and the state - which had been barely functional before - was entirely non-functional. As reported in The Economist at the time, agencies carried out mass vaccinations against cholera but some people were vaccinated multiple times and others were missed entirely because there were so many agencies all running around like headless chickens.<p>Again, a simple distributed identity system would have permitted a better response.<p>Or the other example from the linked paper ... in rural communities in the world&#x27;s poorest countries, people&#x27;s identities are vouchsafed entirely by that community. Community-based lending programs (as popularised by Grameen Bank in Bangladesh) are successful precisely because individuals lack identity or their own independent credit record. Micro-lenders offer loans to these community groups rather than individuals and so the individual builds up no credit record of their own.<p>If they ever need to move (because of drought, joblessness or whatever) they lose the reference and identity they have built in that community. They cannot take it with them.<p>In the presence of a motivated and functioning state, sure, maybe this isn&#x27;t needed. Unfortunately, billions of people don&#x27;t have that luxury.",1421956431

Feigenbaum was testifying before Congress: &quot;The US will become an agrarian nation&quot; if Congress didn&#x27;t fund a big national AI lab headed by him.  The expert systems crowd were claiming they were headed for strong AI in the near term.  They were in complete denial about the fact that expert systems mostly give you back what you put in.  You can code up some kinds of &quot;how-to&quot; information as rules, but it&#x27;s just a form of declarative programming.<p>It was frustrating hearing those professors. I&#x27;d spent time in industry before going to Stanford for a MSCS, and I could tell that they were stuck and covering for it.<p>A few years later, Stanford moved computer science from Arts and Sciences to Engineering.  This pushed the CS department into more practical directions. The School of Engineering had deans, supervision, and planning.  CS under Arts and Sciences was sort of what each professor wanted to teach.  There was no undergraduate CS at Stanford before that move; prospective undergrad students were told &quot;get a liberal education&quot;.<p>That didn&#x27;t end the &quot;AI Winter&quot; at Stanford, though.  It took the DARPA Grand Challenge, in 2003-2005, to do that.  The head of DARPA, Dr. Tony Tether, used the Grand Challenge to force the big-name AI schools to get some results.  DARPA had been funding automatic driving work at Stanford and CMU since the 1960s, with disappointing results.  The big-name schools were quietly told that if the private sector and amateurs outdid them in the Grand Challenge, DARPA was turning off their AI funding.  Suddenly entire CS departments were devoted to the Grand Challenge.  Stanford had to bring in machine learning people from CMU to compete.  That&#x27;s what turned the department around and finally pushed the logicians into the background.",1421956354

Unlike an oblong rectangle, it fits very well in a pocket; doesn&#x27;t wobble around.  Holding it feels solid... and it makes using the apps fantastic.  I have all the width in the world to view webpages like a desktop, explore maps with my thumbs, load up spreadsheets (never thought I would want to do that on my phone, but suddenly it was easy).  I can zoom into things with my thumbs easily.  I <i>love</i> the square shape.  It also means the keyboard is an excellent size.<p>2. Keyboard - Wide real-physical-buttons keyboard.... which is also a touchscreen!  It&#x27;s capacitive touch across the <i>real</i> buttons.  I&#x27;ve never seen this anywhere, and it works phenomenally.  This is used for a variety of reasons, mostly subtle features that make typing wonderful.  I can backspace a word by swiping right-to-left across the keyboard.  By swiping down across the keyboard, I load a large set of symbols that appear over the screen&#x27;s UI, so now I have 7 rows of buttons easily accessible whenever I want, which is awesome (I type a lot of symbols!).  I can double-&quot;touchscreen-tap&quot; (not click) on the keyboard to load a &quot;bubble&quot; text-cursor which is super useful for selecting down-to-the-exact-character-I-want part of text for select/copy/paste/etc., or even just to navigate around where I&#x27;m typing (I scroll around on the keyboard-touchscreen to move it).  It&#x27;s hard to describe but there are so many little features built into this thing that make it great as a power-user.<p>3. It&#x27;s a bit like Linux in the 90&#x27;s -- there aren&#x27;t so many apps, but the base OS gives you <i>tons</i> of features that are important to me as a power-user.  For example, it can aggregate all your messaging from different apps into one place, where you can create filters for which subsets of messages you care to see, you can easily prioritize or delete messages, etc.  The wide screen helps with this.   Also I have many options for tethering (mobile hotspot, or tether via USB or bluetooth), screen-sharing via miracast etc., and lots of other connectivity tools etc.",1421956283

Yes, focussing on content instead of big explosions is what increases depth and the kind of beauty I also like. But the IF world is wrong that it must be pure text. A game like Dwarf Fortress for example can tell a lot of its story without text. You see your dwarfs moving towards the goblins, nobody needs to explicitly write it down for you and prompt you for an interaction. Shadow Run Returns is a X-Com like tactics game, but it also has a lot of text adventure influence with all its heavy dialogue with different choices etc. And by adding these other elements together with text based story and depth, you get something more deep and more efficient.<p>Text is not a game.

The simplest answer may be unpopular even if it’s the right one, and I think that’s why people so often ignore it.<p>The truth is that US taxes are about as low as they have ever been for any developed country, there are more loopholes than ever before, and money has corrupted politics to the point where the wealthy determine elections now instead of the voting populace.<p>The reason this matters is that the poor don’t have capital.  They don’t even have good credit.  How can they be expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and get an education when people even on this site (one of the densest concentrations of intelligence in the world) constantly demand privatization?  Take away the entirety of a people’s wealth and what do they have left?  Their inalienable rights, their community, their heritage, in essence their government.  I think any attack on what we’ve traditionally thought of as government services (like public education) is only going to lead us faster to aristocracy.<p>I have an inkling of what could be done to reduce wealth inequality but the pragmatic view of these things has become unpopular.  I just ask that anyone who is passionate about something like school vouchers or inheritance taxes take a step back and look at the big picture.  Instant runoff voting, publicly funded elections, and treating all net income equally under a progressive tax system are just a handful of newish ideas that would do wonders for leveling the playing field.

Powerful, good external packages. Strict syntax means you learn how to do things the right way<p>Java: Used everywhere and can be applied to almost any project. Verbose but has solid performance and ability to segregate tasks and concerns.<p>Ruby: Rails (about the only reason I can think to really use Ruby).<p>Javascript: Easy to pick up but also easy to falter because the language gives you so much freedom you can easily do things wrong and not realize until much later. That being said, for the initiated, JS is having a renaissance for frontend (angular,et al) and backend stacks (node, et al).<p>C++/C#: The father of modern OO programming languages and his sexier grandson that took the best parts of everything before and placed a Microsoft sticker on it.<p>PHP: Wordpress and Facebook still run on this aging server side language.<p>And then from this list you have a ton of variations on each like Scala and Clojure falling out of Java. Go is out there as well. Objective C became Apple&#x27;s Swift.<p>I think the best way to start is really C++ or Java. Learn the fundamentals, data types, algorithms, performance tradeoffs, OO design and fundamentals. Take those skills and carry them over to any other language or application you want to work on.

8931208,comment,8930360,8930784,0,0,Jugurtha,,,"I think the author fired this to capture the attention of the reader early on, so that later he could expose the problem.<p>At first, it seemed as if the author almost conveys the thought that educated people should feel guilty from breeding with other educated people.<p>But thinking about it, all he seems to want is to break the implication: Bright kid ==> came from educated family.<p>To tear down causality, so that even kids who were born in ghettos could do something with their lives.<p>However, pondering on my own family:<p>My mother didn&#x27;t continue college. My father studied in a technical high-school, but didn&#x27;t go to college due to the fact our country was invaded by France and he had to provide for his mother and brothers and sisters, working with his father. He didn&#x27;t go to college so that they get to.<p>Even though they didn&#x27;t go to college, and although they were under great financial stress, there was one thing you couldn&#x27;t mess with at home: Reading. They were ferocious readers. I was raised in a home with the classics (Balzac, Dumas, Hugo), books about plants, History, philosophy, geography, manuals for everything (from sewing machines, to guns and radio transmission). They raised 9 kids and we all went through a ton of stuff. We call the bathroom &quot;The National Library&quot; for a reason.<p>I wasn&#x27;t allowed to go out until I&#x27;ve written many pages (to improve hand-writing, way before I was of age to be schooled. When I was 10, first year we started French at school (by that time, I had been exposed to the language for 10 years already), my teacher accused me of not being the one who wrote the text she asked us to and I had to write in front of her to believe. It was a &quot;grown-up&quot; writing). I&#x27;ve been accused so many times of cheating because I did something &quot;I wasn&#x27;t supposed to be able to do or knew something I wasn&#x27;t supposed to know&quot;.<p>They schooled my brothers and sisters, who then schooled me.<p>My first three languages, I learned at home, my fourth when I started playing with kids outside. And then English, etc. My childhood was reading, reading, and reading. I had to summarize things like stories, and explain them. I&#x27;ve been asked questions on them. Engineering magazines, newspapers, you name it.<p>I assumed all the kids had to do this.<p>We became Software/Civil/Electronics Engineers, Architects, Maths and Chem/Physics grads and Designers.<p>So the question is: Knowing that they didn&#x27;t go to college, and the fact my father was a political prisoner for years, and my mother had her parents tortured and murdered by French military when she was 9 or so...<p>How did they manage not to fall into the trap of perpetuating the cycle, and blaming their life conditions. After all, failing our education would&#x27;ve been extremely easy to justify with what they went through.<p>The answer is, in one word: Sacrifice. They sacrificed a lot of things and were not selfish, and never complained or neglected our education by finding an excuse in self-pity on why it was okay to fail us. <i>Then</i> my brothers and sisters were not selfish by transmitting and putting a <i>lot</i> of effort in my education, more than they received. And we&#x27;re putting that effort with my nieces and nephews.<p>Would we stop putting that much effort in my nieces and nephews if public education was of quality? Definitely not.

The amount of testing, testing, testing, testing, TESTING and endless revision that&#x27;s required to iron out every little nit-picky detail of a user&#x27;s interaction with a product is immensely time consuming and expensive. You need top-tier designers working for years with large teams of testers, beta users, etc.<p>For example: I could not imagine fielding a competent turn-by-turn directions app for a phone for less than $10-$15 million in funding, minimum. Then you&#x27;d need millions a year <i>minimum</i> in recurrent revenue to finance the endless polish and nit-picky improvements that would be required year over year to keep it competitive with the alternatives.<p>Tiny details matter. For example, when you start turn-by-turn directions on Google&#x27;s Maps app for Android, it doesn&#x27;t say anything right away if you&#x27;re already going along the correct route. It&#x27;s silent until it&#x27;s time to turn. This caused me to assume something was wrong with it or my volume was down. Almost made me throw my phone out the window.<p>Think about what a tiny detail that is. Google with all it&#x27;s funding and team didn&#x27;t catch that. Apple got it right. Their Maps app starts talking immediately, letting you know it&#x27;s working.<p>It&#x27;s a new age -- the age of overall user experience. Features are now a commodity. They don&#x27;t matter all that much. Getting something working is only step one of ten. The other nine steps are to get it working <i>well</i>.",1421954777

There is a sliding scale of what levels of language imply what levels of offense and it changes depending on context. And this is just one of many properties in evaluation of environment.<p>I&#x27;ve started thinking participants in social environments have an at-least-4-tuple for every context: their desired, expected, perceived, and actual social setting.  And a tuple exists for every possible context.<p>The thing that makes for a hostile environment isn&#x27;t that Linus&#x27; posts are &quot;No Big Deal&quot; or a &quot;Big Deal, Indeed&quot;, but that people disagree in their desires on how the setting should treat a Linus rant.  Especially when there are people that not only expect their opinion to win, but make it imperative to their politics that the culture adapt to them rather than the other way around.<p>Programming is the most tame, calm, and soft-spoken professional environment I&#x27;ve ever been in.  I&#x27;m used to adjusting my expectation for social scripts for different environments.  I&#x27;ve learned to be comfortable in environments with innocuous swearing and ranting elsewhere, I can take it here too.

Most of the ones I&#x27;ve run into have holes in core skills that are taught as part of a CS degree, like threading, pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value, DB normalization, separation of concerns, basic optimization, etc... To be fair a lot of CS grads haves holes too (including me), but at least you can assume some sort of base to work from. I&#x27;ll never forget the blank stare from one of my self-taught coworkers when I tried to explain that it was a bad idea to try to do a full parse of a Turing-complete language with just regexes. He seriously thought that if he just tweaked his regexes a little more it would work.<p>Also, working on code in a team is very different from working on personal projects alone. It adds in a whole bunch of things that aren&#x27;t necessary on personal projects. You don&#x27;t just need to know how to use a VCS but how to use it in a way that won&#x27;t cause headaches for your coworkers. You need to know how to write code that people other than you can read and maintain it. In many cases you may be responsible for drawing out requirements from users. You need to communicate effectively with the rest of the team. None of these skills are exercised or put on display by your typical github repo.<p>So, personally, I can see why someone would be very hesitant to hire a self-taught programmer with no experience. If someone has a degree and a little job experience, you know they at least know enough to pass their courses and survive in a team environment. With the unknown guy, you need to do some very rigorous testing to make sure you&#x27;re not getting a dud. A lot of companies might not have the resources to do that.",1421954671

Years of schooling has steadily increased.<p>In my experience, the impact of spending money on education is greatly exaggerated. I was a smart kid, probably 2.5+ STD above the norm in IQ, who went to public school for a while, then to private school. In public school, I learned math mostly by going through problems in the text book. At expensive private school, I learned math mostly by going through problems in the text book. Kids who were at the bottom of the bell curve at this private school still struggled, there was nothing money could buy to make them struggle less. The primary benefit of an expensive private school is that I was surrounded with other smart people, who I could have nerdy conversations with, rather than being a weirdo nerd. The second benefit is that you get to start building a network earlier. This benefit was very limited though, as we all scattered after graduation into different locations and careers. Most of that $40k is being spent on luxuries, not on stuff needed to educate, because education is inherently quite cheap. Mostly you just need to read stuff and practice, with just a bit of guidance from a mentor to check your work and keep you on the right path.<p>Anyone who wants to spend more money on education needs to state exactly what the money should be spent on, why they believe spending that money will have a positive ROI, and also needs an explanation of why the money we are already spending has not equalized things.<p>Imagine you had the freedom to design an education for your child and a group of his or her peers. Any money that you save could be spent on helping them get started with a mortgage or investing in their startup or spent on interesting travel or vacations. How much would you need to spend to max-out their learning? How would you spend it?",1421954569

I don&#x27;t need &quot;File, Edit, etc&quot; on every program window.<p>Well a lot of programs are ditching having a menu bar at all.  This Firefox window I&#x27;m typing this into is really minimal -- no menu at all.  If you&#x27;re a desktop space whore than this is better than both options.  I feel like the Mac way makes sense when desktop space is at a premium (like with the original Mac) but I have more desktop space than I know what to do with!<p>> Actually, I find myself getting confused the other way around. In Windows, if I step away from my desk, and come back, it&#x27;s not clear to me which program is currently active<p>That&#x27;s a valid point.  After getting distracted, I&#x27;ve typed into the wrong window in my multi-monitor desktop because the wrong app has focus.  But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be any more likely to look in the very top left corner of one monitor to see which one is active either.  In a single monitor situation, this is almost a non-issue.<p>> I feel like the root of our different workflows has as lot to do with the fact that I prefer to autohide my taskbars<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t autohide but I do make them smaller than the current Windows default.<p>> As long as those two remain intertwined concepts in Windows, it&#x27;s going to feel less logical to me (in my opinion of course).<p>This is a totally valid point and I don&#x27;t have a good argument against it.  But I think it comes with the baggage of having that single top menu bar which I think is much less logical.  But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to reconcile these things.  I will say that Office has probably the worst window management of any application on Windows but thankfully I usually only have one document open at a time.  Ironically, NextStep has menus in each app and this was removed when it became OS X to make the transition easier for users.<p>> So far, I feel pretty keyboard-warrior-y just as much as I was on Windows.<p>I&#x27;m actually more of a mouse person or perhaps more accurately a combo mouse/keyboard.  But strangely enough, my file management workflow is weirdly hampered on OS X.  I found a few apps that just wouldn&#x27;t let me CTRL-C CTRL-V a file into them, for example.  I&#x27;m willing to concede if I used nothing but the keyboard, the Finder might be better but in my usage I just find it frustrating.",1421954523

If it happens too frequently it can become counter-productive.<p>On the other hand, some problems can take a long time just to figure out what&#x27;s going on, and even more it can be difficult to articulate the issue precisely.  As long as the problem is well formulated and precise, progress can usually be achieved by bringing the problem (without solution).<p>Generally speaking, though, it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that a manager usually has a ton on his plate already and needs to deal with all his team&#x27;s problems, whereas the developer is only responsible for working on the one problem.<p>Final point would be that, especially with younger devs, they can get into a &quot;paralysis by analysis&quot; state.  I encourage younger devs to not work on a problem for too long so they&#x27;re not spinning their wheels.

Not that I&#x27;m excusing it, it&#x27;s just that almost all the times you see someone pointing out him being an asshole, you can go back up the email chain to find the person he&#x27;s being an asshole to being obtuse. Combine this with a deep care that Linus has for his &quot;baby&quot;, and tons of crap trying to get past the radar on a regular basis, and it&#x27;s understandable his reactions are what they are.<p>Similar situations arise in communities where denial and/or subterfuge are common tactics, such as climate change denial and creationism. Just look up the term &quot;sea lioning&quot;.<p>That being said, I am for more diverse opinions, which I think you only truly get when you have more diverse points of view, which is why I agree that prejudice is a very bad thing. What is interesting to me, though, is I have yet to see prejudice from eg Linus. He&#x27;s mean, yes, but he tends to &quot;spread the love&quot; (as the kernel management guide puts it) fairly evenly and not based on prejudice. Of course, I might just not be seeing this because I&#x27;m a white straight cis male.<p>Last but not least, I agree that ideas and code are fair game for criticism. Unfortunately, sometimes people associate with their ideas (and sometimes code too) and take it as a personal insult when their idea or code is criticised.",1421953955

8931036,comment,8930360,8930360,0,0,putzdown,,,"I find this article rather bizarre. The opening paragraph sounds a note that the rest of the article fails to pick up. It seems to me newsworthy that so many of the presumed candidates for 2016 are attached to past presidents, and &quot;aristocracy&quot; in that sense is definitely worrying and worth public discussion. But that&#x27;s not the subject of the article.<p>The subject of the article is the privilege (&quot;aristocracy&quot; even) of intelligence. The thesis is that intelligent parents beget intelligent children, and since intelligence tends to beget success and wealth, intelligence represents a sort of inheritable good, a &quot;fortune,&quot; in effect, handed down through family lines. Since all such inherited benefits undermine equality (the claim goes), they are a societal evil and should be combatted. The article suggests that the best way to combat them is to promote the less-intelligent or the intelligent-without-parentage. This is soft-gloving the issue; if inherited intelligence really is a societal evil, surely holding down those who are intelligent would also be a valid strategy.<p>This is a wonky argument at best. A few of the holes:<p>In what way is this situation new? If the inheritance of intelligence gives a unfair advantage to the heirs, when in all of human history was this ever not a source of inequality?<p>Surely inequality (in this abstract sense) is not such a universal, unmitigated evil that it must be fought everywhere it appears. People are in fact different; some people have advantages; some of these advantages are inherited. Where&#x27;s the evil, the danger, in that? &quot;Equality&quot; in the sense that democracies embrace and fight for has never been taken as encompassing personal traits. If I&#x27;m beautiful and my parents are beautiful, should I hide my face in shame in a democratic nation? If I&#x27;m a great pole vaulter and so was my mother, should I hide my skill or contribute extra funds to support the training of weaker pole vaulters? The article misunderstands the notion of equality and, consequently, misidentifies the &quot;danger&quot; or &quot;unfairness&quot; arising from differences in people&#x27;s abilities.<p>This is no innocent error. If we truly believed, as a society, that smart/beautiful/talented/gifted people posed a danger to society, represented a form of inequality, and formed an &quot;aristocracy,&quot; we would be motivated to perpetrate the grossest sort of manipulations (at best) and atrocities (at worst) to equalize them with us ordinary folk. The result would be horrific, evil, and destructive to the utmost, not only for those unfortunates who were subjected to &quot;equalization&quot; but also for society itself.<p>Attack the privileged, if you must, when their possessions or powers pose a threat to the wellbeing of members of society in general. Do not attack those who simply have great abilities, even if their parents did too, or you&#x27;ll achieve nothing but spite against your own face.",1421953854

The 2:1 dilution risk at 50% reduces that to $750k. The bad-will at liquidation risk reduces the value to $660k. The 5% chance of such a payout makes the value of the equity $33k.<p>So on those optimistic assumptions, there&#x27;s $3k of upside in taking the deal.

I can&#x27;t even comprehend how you could read the article and come away with this conclusion. I can therefore only conclude that you either did not read the article at all, or that you read it entirely filtered through you preconceptions until you had built just enough evidence that what you believed already was correct.  Then you rushed over here to comment about how everything is fine because society is sifting itself into the intelligent vs the unintelligent.<p>I actually read the goddamn article so let me restate it for you here to make it clear for you: The new advantage in our economy is essentially education, although the article uses the 5 dollar word &quot;intellectual capital&quot;. Because the amount of &quot;intellectual capital&quot; a person has is closely tied to the amount of <i>actual</i> capital their parents have,  we are seeing increasing inequality on this front.  Rich parents are able to provide stimulation and training for their child from birth by way of having more free time because they can afford it, or by having various tutors for their child.  When their child reaches school, rich people get better schooling for their children due to America&#x27;s insane school funding paradigm.  Finally, when those children reach college, rich people are actually able to afford to send their children to good institutions, and receive preferential admission for their &quot;legacy students&quot;.<p>None of the above points to society filtering itself on some sort of intrinsic &quot;merit&quot; that a person is born with, leading to some grand meritocracy.  Rather it points to a new type of capital being important in our system, and wealthy people being able to cultivate it for their children.  Improving prospects for disadvantaged kids might just <i>make</i> them &quot;smart&quot;, not that they are born smart and just held back by poverty.<p>TL;DR: Two kids of equal potential will have their economic circumstances dictate just how &quot;smart&quot; they become, and in an economy predicated on being &quot;smart&quot; this will lead to inequality.  America should work to allow both children to become as &quot;smart&quot; as they possibly can be.",1421953746

People pay for access to 1s and 0s at a certain bandwidth and that is provided without prioritizing one type of traffic over another (save for upload/download speeds). At least, this is how I hope it works. If you want QoS, you&#x27;d do so on your own network with your own router.<p>> Anti-competetive capitalism certainly also is.<p>Free market and democracy are two separate issues, although it would be my argument that they are in constant disagreement with each other...at least in the case of American Capitalism. In the US, you have large corporations lobbying for less and less regulation generally at the <i>expense</i> of the citizens (and thus the republic).<p>When something becomes so pervasive that society as it exists <i>cannot live without it</i> (like the internet), it&#x27;s my belief that it&#x27;s in the hands of government to regulate it ferociously so that it&#x27;s not at the whim of a company which doesn&#x27;t have your best interests in mind. This is especially true, in the case of internet, in places where only one ISP exists and the usual ridiculous argument of &quot;Just switch providers!&quot; doesn&#x27;t work. Even if there <i>are</i> two providers, they are generally both terrible anyway.<p>There comes a point where people in the US need to realize that yes, free market is great, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that the citizen&#x27;s best interests (or customer&#x27;s interests, even) are represented by <insert corporation here> and this is where regulation comes in.<p>There&#x27;s a balance. Anti-competitive capitalism can, in moderation, be absolutely <i>great</i> for democracy.

While this is an interesting argument it more often seems that those from a privileged background will have more opportunities to succeed then their less fortunate peers.  This is not at all related to their abilities at a given job or even their education but has far more to do with the peer group of their parents.

This actually happens and isn&#x27;t debatable.<p>What I personally really don&#x27;t like about these people is that they go after open source specifically, which leads me to believe many of them have never worked for a large company but only have experience in the open source sector, which by it&#x27;s nature allows anyone to participate.<p>I mean, accusing open source of being intolerant or whatever is like an alien race accusing the human species of being intolerant because they observed that --yes-- when you allow people to live in a society freely some people make decisions others (gasp) <i>disagree with</i>.<p>These geek feminists should all go close their source and only allow people to work with them who they deems is tolerable. A Big corporation --no matter how progressive they may seem from the outside-- is always going to have someone working for them that says some stupid shit. Look at the racist emails in the wake of the sony leak from some of their top people.<p>I don&#x27;t want a monoculture of people pretending to be nice. Blaming open source is just a way to push an agenda.<p>If this &quot;geek feminist crowd&quot; wants to fork off and do their own thing and base it around being nice to each other then it&#x27;s just a matter of time until their top devs get exposed for being human and they look like idiots. The geek feminist community seems to contain more assholes than any open source community I&#x27;ve ever been a part of, in fact I&#x27;ve worked with a few feminists who have said some very nasty things about people of a certain color. Unfortunately, the JavaScript crowd seems to have a lot of feminsits and I had the displeasure of working with a JS developer who was a rich white straight male feminist asshole google employee. He would talk about how hard minorities have it on his personal blog and then get on github/irc and treat everyone like shit. Pretty typical geek feminist in my experience.",1421953366

8930980,comment,8928433,8930799,0,0,RussianCow,,,"Yeah, that&#x27;s completely fair. I generally work on projects with constantly evolving requirements, so I tend to roll my own framework(s) by gluing together existing libraries that each solve a specific problem very well. That approach works well for me because most of the time I simply don&#x27;t know the long-term implications of using an existing framework for any given project, so it&#x27;s easier for me to evolve my own as I go. But I think there are a lot of projects out there that benefit greatly from the ecosystem behind certain frameworks (Rails comes to mind) and don&#x27;t run into many bottlenecks due to said frameworks. For them, assembling a foundation is totally unnecessary because there&#x27;s an open source framework that provides exactly what they need.<p>I don&#x27;t have enough experience in different types of environments to say which approach is most suitable in most cases, but I&#x27;ll definitely say that using an existing framework is the safer path (you have a community to lean back on), and is also advantageous for hiring. So I think you&#x27;re correct when you say that many developers are afraid of rolling their own frameworks, but I think there are good reasons for that, especially for quickly-growing startups.",1421953309

This is the first part of subtyping. The second part is that we must have that definitions of Q[S] for any Q must follow naturally from definitions of Q[T].<p>So let&#x27;s say that Apple is a subtype of Fruit. That means that there exists a natural coercion function f : Apple => Fruit. It also means that if we have a predicate Delicious that we define for both Fruit and Apple then the answer Delicious[Apple] must be exactly Delicious[Fruit].comap(f). If they don&#x27;t align then your coercion function is somehow wrong and not implementing subtyping properly.",1421953289

However, the company seems to have gladly taken your call to discuss it with you, and then consult their lawyers regarding the potential for a change. While you didn't get what you want, it seems like they were fairly considerate.<p>So, just change the nameservers after registration and move on.

The problem still remains once I become deeply entrenched in SCSS it will have drifted pretty far from plain CSS.<p>The argument about rails vs struts may have been similar, but I don't think the comparison holds water. Web development frameworks are different than markup and stylesheet standards. We have standards that define HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. There is no one standard that governs MVC frameworks.<p>So while I would expect any competent web developer to know HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I would not expect them to be competent in my particular choice of web framework since there is necessarily less standardization in that area.<p>My core point is that you need to exercise some caution before jumping into all these different technologies with both feet.

I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a registrar.<p>That being said, I don't use them for DNS.

Do you object out of hand to non-peer reviewed science articles regardless of quality?  Do you have specific objections to the quality of this article?<p>From my point of view, there has been a long standing public health problem in the US with obesity and related pathologies.  The public has been understandably interested in the outcome, and so there is demand for press coverage.  The scientific progress in identifying the cause of the problem has been uneven and there have been some incorrect conclusions about the root cause, even among experts in the field.  As a result, the media coverage has also been incorrect.  However, this article seems reasonable.  It makes clear references to current scientific work, presents the subject evenly (barring the title), and the author makes efforts to explain to an educated but non-scientific audience.",1302724571

The advertising the author is complaining about only shows up if you do not configure the DNS records or name servers after buying the domain.  Usually I spend 30 seconds setting this up as soon as I buy the domain, so the advertising doesn't even cross my mind.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought this practice was pretty standard across the industry.  The ""unscrupulous"" registrar tactics that I'm more concerned about are registrars that take domains when they sense demand (such as from searching or whois lookups) and hold it from you until you pay a premium.  I've never had this issue with name.com and have found it very easy to transfer domains with them as well.",1302724533

He has defined a syndrome of vagally-mediated beta-cell hyperactivity which leads to insulin hypersecretion and obesity, and which is treatable by insulin suppression. This phenomenon may occur in up to 20% of the obese population. He is interested in the hypothalamic signal transduction of insulin and leptin, and how these two systems interact. He is studying the cardiovascular morbidity associated with hyperinsulinemia, and developing methods to evaluate and prevent this phenomenon in children.

There's Asimo, Honda's million-dollar humaniform bot, which can move only when a real person is driving it, and Roomba, the autonomous robo-vacuum from iRobot whose movements resemble those of insects. Unlike rocketry - a real engineering discipline inspired by science fiction - intelligent robots (and virtual reality for that matter, which 20 years after cyberpunk is pretty much dead in the water) serve best as metaphors for the zeitgeist of their eras.</i><p>Which makes me wonder- will there be new interest in VR as well?

If you're dead set on it, then as others have pointed out, the freelancing approach (Elance, Guru, oDesk, etc.) does work, to a point.  On those sites, you'll always be competing against some insanely low-cost (and low-quality) offshore workers but that's not as big an issue.  Again, even on those sites, the issue will be a demonstrated track record of excellence.  So, best advice would be to take 3-5 projects on those sites of any size doing anything you feel comfortable doing and don't worry about the $$.  Hit home runs on those projects and two things will happen:<p>(1) There's a very good chance those who hire you will hire you again or extend the projects out<p>(2) You now have ammo to get other better/more lucrative online freelance projects.<p>Do the online freelance thing for maybe two years and have tons of good real-world experience under your belt and then you have a shot at landing a full-time remote work position.<p>Just my two cents worth...",1302721520

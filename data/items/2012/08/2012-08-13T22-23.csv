I'm concerned about leaking a couple of these types of passwords, enough for someone to notice the pattern and apply it to the rest of your online presence. I'm sure there are black hats building personal databases of every password leak that goes by and it wouldn't be hard to do some sub-string matching to identify people making simple patterns like this.<p>I'm also concerned about a targeted attack against my online identity. I've had a couple of online acquaintances be the victim of targeted attacks, one holding accounts hostage as a sort of online blackmail. Someone who compromises a couple of random forums and picks up on the pattern now has the key to your online identity. I'd mitigate it somewhat by using multiple prefixes and suffixes, one set for 'throwaway' accounts and others for more important stuff. Even that tactic has issues, do you remember to change your password for that throwaway site that blew up with success and now your account is part of your online identity?<p>The alternatives aren't too reassuring though, I balance these risks against the possibility of my KeePass, LastPass or browser password list getting compromised.",1344898783

However, the same problems still exist.<p>For instance, I enjoy the show <i>Adventure Time</i>, so I subscribed to the /r/adventuretime subreddit. It was fine for a while, but then a submission popped up on my front page. It was a photograph of a group of kids cosplaying as <i>Adventure Time</i> characters at a local convention, and a few of the kids either had a ""poorly done"" costume or were heavier than the characters they were cosplaying. The top comments in this thread were saying hurtful things about their weight and attractiveness. Not fluffed up ""jokes""; these were crude and would warrant a punch in the face in any real life situation. When I made a comment about how it was rude for them to say such things, and that cosplaying is about the person cosplaying, not the people viewing, I was met with hostility and downvotes. I even messaged the moderators asking them to remove the comments since they offered nothing but vitriol, but the only moderator to respond said, ""I'm not their mother. This is the internet.""<p>You can try to escape it by going into smaller and smaller subreddits, but you'll never outrun it. This is what I mean by it being pervasive.* It's in everything on the site.

But the situation is more complicated.<p>There are two important things to understand here, which I've learnt the hard way.<p>1. The entire business model, not just the exit strategy, of almost all VC-funded startups is <i>selling the company</i>. They start with selling little chunks of the company to investors, culminating in the exit, when they sell the whole thing to BigCo. IPOs are black swan events in this respect.<p>There's no fear of money here. When you can get millions selling chunks of your company, purely based on ""engagement"", why would you break your head trying to sell product?<p>Founders who are well aware that this is their business model are very good at talking big and using visionary rhetoric. They avoid talking about mundane business details and use phrases like ""passionate about X"" and ""ripe for disruption"".<p>Founders who are actually interested in building a product-based company and running it for the long-term are rare. Drew Houston is a great example, and I respect him a lot for it.<p>2. If you do not intend to raise venture capital, then following the business tactics of VC-funded startups can mean death. Free and freemium have unfortunately become the default for all software now - even apps built by bootstrapped solo founders. This is a huge mistake.<p>If you are not actively working the market to sell your company, to investors in chunks or to an eventual acquirer in bulk, you're digging your own grave by giving away your product for free.<p>Better start actively working the market to sell your product for hard cash instead.",1344897694

(I don't have the foggiest idea about it, really)<p>If your password manager encrypts each password separately, and stores that output separately, then that simplifies the task, because you can mount a known-plaintext attack and potentially reduce the complexity.<p>However, if your password manager stores things correctly, all the passwords are stored as a single ""blob"", with no known-plaintext anywhere in the blob, and the entire blob is fed through the encryption algorithm as a single block encryption using a single key.<p>For example, the password safe format ( <a href=""http://passwordsafe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/passwordsafe/trunk/pwsafe/pwsafe/docs/vormatV3.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://passwordsafe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/passwordsafe/...</a> ) the master password is both salted and passed through a work-configurable key stretch function.  The result of that operation is used to encrypt a 256bit random key using the Twofish algorithm.  That 256bit random key is the actual encrypt key for all the password records, again using Twofish as the encryption algorithm.<p>So deriving the master password is made difficult by use of the key-stretch function, and deriving the actual 256bit random key is as difficult as otherwise breaking the Twofish algorithm.",1344897419

If they're busy, Skype just shows they have a new unread message and they can answer it whenever they choose. If they're not busy, the person calls you back. If a long time has elapsed since the initial message, they reply with ""Sure, call me if you're free now"". This is actually less obtrusive than being in an office because if someone comes to your door and asks ""Do you have a few minutes?"" it's impolite to ignore them whereas an ignored Skype message just means you're busy or unavailable.<p>I'm not really seeing the huge benefit here. If you work with others who don't follow such a protocol, set your Skype status to busy and you can't get calls. They'll then have to message you and you can initiate the callback if you're free. And is it really that much of an issue for people to establish calls immediately that there's a compelling need to auto-answer in a mannner that's different from Skype's auto-answer?<p>There's also the chicken and egg issue... nobody uses QuicklyChat and I can't see anybody I know jumping to use it given that everybody is already on Skype and it's 99% good enough with screensharing, full mobile support, forwarding to a phone number when unavailable, and so on.

This is precisely the problem that App.net is addressing: Twitter appeared to be trustworthy but when push came to shove they decided to throw the developers under the bus because they had enough normals that they figured the developers and early adopters weren't necessary anymore.<p>The reason App.net is more trustworthy is because its founding principles are a direct response to this existential threat of advertising dollars subverting the platform.

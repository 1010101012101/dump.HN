1087038,comment,1086841,1086841,0,0,marciovm123,,,"I would much rather have Gates spend his money on clean energy research or infrastructure projects.  This sort of spending tugs at the heart strings but unfortunately it can actually be quite counter-productive at improving the lives of people in undeveloped regions.<p>By decreasing the amount of wealth that is necessary for a human person to remain alive - for example by introducing a new vaccine that allows  a large (5+) family in unsanitary conditions to have all of their children reach adulthood - these sorts of programs in undeveloped countries actually create more poverty then they solve.  There is not a cheap-manual labor shortage in these countries.  There is however an acute shortage of well-paying jobs that don't involve corruption.  By allowing the supply of just-surviving people to increase, you are putting even more downward pressure on the wages of unskilled labor (they are caught in the Iron Law of wages).<p>Keep in mind that in these countries, with no real legal system, unskilled labor doesn't mean gardening like it does in California but violence in the form of gangs/thug-ocracies who typically control access to natural resources or drug running routes.  By creating more people, you are making it easier for the systems that keep them poor to grow, in a positive feedback loop.<p>The problem is not that a $3 drug is too expensive, and that we need to develop a 30 cent drug, the problem is that there are people who can't afford $3 for a life-saving drug.  What they really need from the US is jobs, markets, and protection from the threats of climate change that we are causing by using 25% of the world's fossil fuels (more if you count the contribution from production in China to the cheap goods that we consume).<p>If Gates really wanted to help these people, he would campaign for an end to developed world farm subsidies, fossil fuel subsidies, and the recreational diamond market.  But that would make him unpopular in the US.<p>EDIT: are downvotes for disagreement or for breach of etiquette?",1264787995

In fact, if you were to do a broad survey using humanitarian work as a criteria, Bill Gates would be the overwhelming preference.  Admiring the charisma of Steve Jobs and the generosity of Bill Gates are not mutually exclusive behaviors.  By suggesting that that people ""stop worshiping Steve Jobs"", you seem to be claiming that they are.<p>Also, ""you techies"" strikes me as distancing language with a hostile tone.

If they are truly 'evil', both insurance and big pharma would benefit much, much more in not having people vaccinated and overpricing drugs every time there is a panic and a run on supplies, ala H1N1. Could you imagine the demand with today's media if there was a measles outbreak in a major city with many deaths?<p>There is no conspiracy.<p>As for mecury, you ingest much more of it every time you eat some fish. It is a fact of life.<p>With every medication, a certain percentage of people will experience side effects. People have died from taking aspirin after all. The point is that a major outbreak of a disease like measles, mumps, rubella, etc would be  catastrophic for a large group of people. It is in all of our interests to do what we can to prevent this from happening, even if it means a small, small percentage suffer in the process.<p>Look at a history book. There is but one constant dread in every story: plague. Disease has culled populations quickly and dramatically in regular fashion for as long as humanity has existed. When is the last time you remember a major outbreak killing off half your neighbourhood? Exactly. That's due 100% to vaccinations.<p>Get vaccinated.

There are evidence that vaccination is not safe, contains mercury and has negative long term side effects. Also there are long lasting  debates on whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the harm.  I have looked at both sides of the argument and based on what I have read and concluded that  I would not  vaccinate myself or my kids(see my reasoning below).  
Government cares only of the short term effect and keeping society from outbreaks of deceases where they are less concerned of long term effect that will be hard to link to any past vaccinations anyways.   Even the fact the insurance companies do not cover vaccination due to possibility of severe side effects poses a question why?
The long trim effect of vaccine is not well studied yet.  If you look at both sides of the argument, the major question is what side has more benefit for fighting.   Pharmaceuticals make tons of money on vaccination and have tons of money to promote it including usage of science as well government policies.   So looking at both sides where none have concrete scientifically proof on long term effect of vaccines, what side would you take thinking on benefits that each side might have in the argument as well as possessing knowledge of possible danger of vaccine including the fact that vaccine do not work 100% as well.  So the ultimate question, would you put substance containing mercury in your body knowing that it will have side effect  for sure what might be mild or severe in long term against some low chance possibility of getting diseases that your body will fight anyway and that having vaccinated might not even protect you against.

316612,comment,316171,316512,0,0,shimon,,,"I'd be interested to hear more about this.  I think there are some significant opportunities to make cities better (maybe by starting new ones, maybe just by working with our existing ones in new ways).  And a lot of the ways technology has changed our lives recently has affected what we need and expect from a city, including things like:<p>- knowing our neighbors<p>- usable mass transit<p>- energy efficiency<p>- interaction with government<p>It's the sort of area that I think has a lot of opportunity in it, but that opportunity isn't clearly something that could make you rich.  So as a general area of focus, I think it'd be well worth a hacker's attention.<p>P.S. If you think cities, architecture, and the community shaped by those things are interesting, you should definitely read ""A Pattern Language"" by Christopher Alexander et al.  It illuminates a lot of what goes on in cities and buildings in a very concise way, and will probably give you ideas to improve your home and environment.",1222473509

316582,comment,315811,316541,0,0,DabAsteroid,,,"<i>They aren't being added to nuclear powerplants because nuclear powerplants have a wide and controllable dynamic range (they can run higher or lower depending)</i><p>Nuclear powerplants, typically, are capital intensive. For this reason, their operators aim for high capacity-factors. Unless economic forces are being ignored, they cannot easily be throttled. They run at 100%, all of the time, except when they are being refueled. The only nation that uses its nuclear powerplants in load-following mode is France -- since such a high proportion, some 80%, of its electricity is nuclear -- and France pays a price for that.<p>Additionally, it is not mechanically good for a nuclear-powerplant to throttle up and down. Such cycling causes parts to wear-out faster. If it is going to be used at all, it is best to keep it on, at a steady output.<p>There are other considerations. The nature of reactor poison build-up is such that throttling-up immediately after throttling-down tends, in typical reactor designs, to be difficult to do.<p>Unlike nuclear-powerplants, hydro and gas-turbine powerplants load-follow well (though the more-efficient gas-turbine powerplants take longer to start-up and might have to burn fuel, idling).<p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\n<i>new [nuclear powerplants] aren't being created.</i><p>The United States continuously adds nuclear capacity (through uprates, improved management, refurbishment of previously shut-down reactors, etc.).

Don't fool yourself: this is definitely part of a master plan, and Fox News are probably the ones behind it.<p>The value of Fox News's hedge fund investments have doubled over the past 70 years-- while ordinary Americans have seen their investments vanish in waves of depression and recession. Coincidence? Definitely not!<p>Many members of the Federal Reserve are secretly working for Fox News on the side. Their air travel habits are proof enough for this, but there's a wealth of additional evidence that the Federal Reserve doesn't want you to see.<p>Employees of Microsoft were seen at both the US Election of 2000 and WW1-- despite the fact that they had no good reason to be there.<p>We've taken a big risk to post this information on the internet-- many others have seen their careers destroyed for doing much less.<p>The only way for upstanding citizens to protect themselves from this madness is to retreat from modern society entirely.",1360043788

5169394,comment,5164354,5167316,1,0,sirclueless,,,"Unless I am doing code review, I don't read code with the intent to find latent bugs or insecure idioms. I assume the programmer who wrote the code was competent, and wrote a correctly functioning program. (If I cannot assume this, then why am I using the code at all?)<p>If I <i>am</i> doing code review, then I have the man pages open anyways. If I am trying to write bug-free code myself, then I have the man pages open anyways. In these cases it doesn't much matter what form of flag I use. But the most common case of reading code is a brief scan trying to grok what the code does, which shouldn't require frequent reference to man-pages in much the same way that reading a novel shouldn't require frequent reference to a dictionary.<p>I understand your concerns about false sense of security and unexpected behavior in corner cases. I've browsed the IOCCC, I've browsed the CVE database, I know how easy it is to hide nasty behavior in unexpected corner case interactions, and that the only defense against them is vigilant attention to documented behavior.<p>To my mind the most common interactions with code, in decreasing order, are as follows:<p>1. Executing it. (Flag agnostic, portability issues aside.)<p>2. Reading it. (Descriptive flags >>> Cryptic flags.)<p>3. Maintaining it. (Standard flags >> Obscure flags.)<p>4. Writing it. (Short flags > Verbose flags.)<p>So I would say the most important thing is that flags are descriptive of their behavior. The second most important thing is that they are common and standardized, but this isn't as important as descriptiveness -- a less common flag that describes its operation better wins. The least important thing is brevity, it only matters once.",1360043771

This makes it a sexist act.<p><i>There are significantly more males in this industry with significantly more popularity. Yet no evidence is presented that these figures also have received this level of harassment.</i><p>When the OP says that ""[women in technology] are scared"" it is because they feel that they are in an environment that targets them for harassment and abuse. At this point, we hear arguments like ""this could have happened to a guy just as easily"" but the fact is that it <i>doesn't</i>. In a world where such events happen with equal frequency across genders then yes, this might be a silly discussion, but we do not live in such a world.<p>Engineers tend to find it disconcerting that an action's goodness or badness depends on its context. After all, shouldn't we be able to tell just by looking at the inherent properties of the action? What if we can't read the context correctly? Well, the answer is that we frequently do, and the result is these inane argument over whether posting fake porn pictures of a woman is a sexist act.<p>The fact of the matter is that women in tech are targeted because they are women. They are overwhelmingly more frequently attacked than their male counterparts, and if you think this is silly, then I suggest you go make friends with some women in tech. This attack is another outgrowth of that pervasive sexism, and the fact that it uses a medium that is traditionally associated with denigrating women [1] just makes it even more sexist.<p>[1] Yes, there is some non-misogynistic porn out there, but it is the exception rather than the rule.",1360043519

I would say something like ""Look, I'm unemployed and looking at several different companies who all want more money than I have.  I'm making this same offer to three credit card companies this week: $1k paid immediately in return for full satisfaction of this debt.  I will understand if you feel the need to reject that offer and sue me, but I have no assets.  This represents the best deal you're going to get.""<p>Do this negotiation entirely on paper, delivered in the postal mail, with return receipt requested.  Don't talk to anyone on the phone for longer than it takes to say ""What is your postal address?""  Your first letter to each company should include language similar to ""It is inconvenient for me to receive debt collection communications via telephone or any other means but postal mail.  This letter constitutes written notice under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act that you are not to contact me about this matter via any method other than the postal mail.""<p>Our overarching strategy here is avoiding having folks sue you (n.b. the process server is in play because someone is <i>already</i> suing you, and merely ducking him will not make that impossible -- they'll just put a notice in the newspaper and the judge will certify ""service accomplished by public notice""), because you'll probably not go to court in time to contest and if you do contest you'll likely lose (you do, after all, owe this money).  You will then have a default judgment entered against you, for the entire sum you borrowed plus interest plus collection costs and legal fees.  This will likely be more than double the amount you <i>think</i> you owe.  The debt collection agency will then begin contacting every bank/etc in the area to see if you have an account and then seize the contents to satisfy the judgement.  If they don't recover 100%, they will petition -- and receive -- a court order to garnish your wages for the next several years until that amount is satisfied.<p>This process will be stressful and costly for you.  It is highly in your advantage to avoid it.  Ignoring it will NOT make it go away.<p><i>I can probably swing a 1k down payment and the rest over monthly payments for a year to a year and a half.</i><p>I would suggest that you be Very Darn Sure (TM) that you can actually handle this this time, because if you get to month 7 on one of those agreements and then miss a payment <i>by even a day</i>, you're in a situation which will be in every possible way worse than the situation you are in today.  You should strongly prefer paying part of your debt today in full satisfaction versus a payment plan.  They will suggest payment plans, because that gets them some money and because probabalisticly <i>you like virtually all other debtors will default on that payment plan</i>, after which point collection costs will inflate the debt to a number at least as large as the number they are claiming now.<p><i>There's also the additional issue that I may have exaggerated my freelance income somewhat on the applications.</i><p>I am not a lawyer, but to the extent that you trust me: you have nothing to worry about with regards to this.",1360043393

I know a number of people in sales that are remote almost all of the time.<p>Sales is much easier than tech/web development to do remotely because you can use commission and/or sales targets to quantify how well the remote salespeople are doing. Don't use a single salesperson as a ""test"" though; abilities vary so much, you'd have to have a larger sample to determines how well remote will work for your company specifically.

That's a problem to men because it reduces us to gullible sex drives, yet it is worse for women because it reduces them to objects of that drive... dismissing any quality that a woman can have as an individual.<p>This is an example of the objectification you see discussed here. Women are the object, men are the subject, we see this in porn, advertisement, and even employment posters (gee, we wonder why 52% of women drop out of the programming field after college.) It's kinda gross and defeating when you take the ""red pill"" and start to see it everywhere. Even more daunting when you go against the grain of prevailing thought and start talking about this being an actual problem. It just seems like everybody else took the ""blue pill"" and just don't want to see it. But it does have a negative effect that has been thoroughly studied.<p>If we accept these tenets as true, and I do and will strongly suggest that you do as well, then we have to see the attack here as sexist. The attack serves to objectify in the same manner as media: by removing individuality, quality, and self from the person. It uses the sexualized images of women just as media uses for this purpose. It is done against a woman, who as I've discussed are oppressed as opposed to men who are simply (at most) discriminated against. It was done so in an obviously malicious manner (that is, beyond parody) in order to hurt their reputation by targeting the fact that they are female (given the nature of their attack,) not by aspects of their character or refuting the merit of their knowledge. That serves to oppress via discrimination determined by their gender: sexist.",1360042606

DO THEY OWN THE DEBT? Just because some company says they own your debt does not mean that they really do. For example, do they have clear documentation about how much you owe, including interest calculations, and complete documentation about your account.

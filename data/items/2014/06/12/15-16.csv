HTTP &quot;MVC&quot; doesn&#x27;t have state between requests whereas client-side MVC has state for the entirety of the app. Rails, for example, has a Router and Controller due to the synchronous nature of how a  request comes in and gets turned into a response.

Google, and others, shifted from supporting pm to qi shortly after, I believe due to licensing costs, and now the market is full of android phones that use qi. I&#x27;ve been using it for my last 2 phones.  Works fine with a cheap Energizer charging pad. Its simple and it works.  I&#x27;m now at the point where I&#x27;m annoyed with fiddling with little connectors, especially if its late at night and I&#x27;m tired and keyed it the wrong way.  Less damaged cables as well.  While I&#x27;m skeptical it&#x27;ll be used in public spots due to the potential of theft, its really nice to have at home.<p>From a tech perspective they both use induction. The A4WP product uses magnetic resonance, but I don&#x27;t think they have a sellable product yet, but in theory they could charge your phone from across the room. I think demos have only shown it work from a few inches away.  This solution is very non-green considering the inverse sq law.  I have a feeling that there will be pushback if people are wasting 2x or 5x the energy to charge their devices, as well as larger electricity bills. Not to mentionn, Joe User asking about &quot;radiation.&quot;<p>The war isn&#x27;t over because Apple hasn&#x27;t picked a side.

That made me laugh a bit.<p>The facts: Turing did not state in his paper that the human interrogator is to be made aware of the replacement.<p>The interpretations: Some more perverse than others :)<p>You don&#x27;t need to mangle the meaning of normal every day English words, though philosophers like to. It&#x27;s remarkable that modern Turing tests are not carried out exactly as described in the paper, yet people lay claim to their interpretations and versions as being better somehow.<p>See <a href=""http://crl.ucsd.edu/~saygin/papers/saygin-jop.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crl.ucsd.edu/~saygin/papers/saygin-jop.pdf</a> for two views that support my point:<p>- For communication to be meaningful, communicators should act rational. Be relevant, avoid obscurity, needless repetition, social faux pas and ambiguity. Following Paul Grice&#x27;s principles you get more normal and effective communication. This is significantly different from trying to trick a machine using obtuse, ambiguous, repetitious, weird communication. Remember: the original test was for player A and B to trick player C. Kurzweil&#x27;s test is for player C to trick player A into revealing it is a bot.<p>- They created an entire chapter on bias (prior knowledge that the person was possibly talking to a machine). This shows that it is not a marginal view, but actually a view that makes a difference and has (philosophical) consequences. Subjects do not report thoughts that &quot;this may be a computer&quot;, but they think: Person A is mentally ill or handicapped, on drugs, a child or very confused.<p>To conclude this discussion from my part: I think the modern Turing Tests as inspired by Loebner are fine. However they are not true to the paper in multiple ways, and they assume rules/criteria which Turing omitted. As for validity and philosophical importance of adding this criteria, the onus is on those that add it to prove its worth. If this is a pragmatic criteria to test machine intelligence, then just admit to it. Don&#x27;t take the original paper and say that Turing omitted something, and that you should interpret and fill in the blanks in a certain way, else you are being perverse. As an aside: I muse about the inspiration for the test. I think it may have come from Turing playing 2-ply chess on a computer terminal. If unbeknownst to Turing a Grand Master would start relaying the moves mid-game, would Turing have noticed, and would Turing have noticed it in the near future? Though computers beat GM&#x27;s nowadays, GM&#x27;s still  have correct suspicions when playing against an opponent using computer aid: The lines are too perfect, alien or far-fetched. It&#x27;s interesting that even though artificial intelligence is already better at natural language processing and games of chess, it still does not suffice as human enough for some of us.",1402587423

IE9 is a bad choice point for this - it&#x27;s the first IE that had auto-update. Everyone left. We&#x27;re catering to IE8+; 8 is currently at 6.5%.<p>2) You don&#x27;t count the version; you count the version and all its successors. That is, we&#x27;re not catering to 8, we&#x27;re catering to 8+. 8+ is at almost 35% and is still the dominant aggregate browser.<p>3) Where does 14% come from? This says 6.8%, or roughly half what&#x27;s claimed, in the same neighborhood as the browsers mentioned: <a href=""http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/1417-Accessibilit.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/1417-Accessibilit...</a>.<p>4) You can&#x27;t cater to disabled users. They&#x27;re not one thing. What you do for the colorblind isn&#x27;t the same as what you do for the blind, which isn&#x27;t the same as what you do for people who have specialty control systems, which isn&#x27;t the same as what you do for micro-screens, which isn&#x27;t the same as what you do for people who have motor control circumstances, et cetera.<p>5) The web solution for this is WAI-Aria, which began in mid-2012, and became a candidate recommendation three months ago.<p>6) Microsoft has been requiring WAI-Aria for store apps since late 2012.<p>7) Most people have never heard of WAI-Aria.<p>8) As far as I know, no single group of disabled users reaches 1% of the userbase.<p>9) Supporting old browsers is way, way easier than supporting disabled users. Old browsers mean installing a shim and fighting a couple bugs, and that level of effort leaves people writing angry blog posts for five years. Supporting disabled users means learning how (there&#x27;s basically no tutorials, but ample angry blog posts with bad statistics) then finding someone who has the equipment to test it on, then learning that you have to re-order everything on the entire site because the reader software can&#x27;t be told that the source order isn&#x27;t the reading order, then adding several properties to every single tag on every single page, then having no way to audit.<p>10) Many of us /do/ cater to the disabled. Your site has no aria markup at all, is peppered with empty iframes (which will wreak havoc on older readers,) and is covered in images that have no reader equivalents.  You are actually substantially less disability friendly than the average webpage.<p>11) Even people with full sight find a font and color scheme like that very difficult to read.<p>12) In short, because like you, most small web authors are more comfortable writing about the problem than being part of the solution.",1402586840

The first is bandwidth, the Oculus&#x27;s screen had too low of a resolution for densely packed information and text, this may have been solved in the latest but I haven&#x27;t seen it in person. Google Glass has the problem because of it&#x27;s really small size, trying to access and manipulate much information on that interface would be extremely slow and cumbersome.<p>The second is with full VR goggles. Right now there&#x27;s not a really good way to be able to use them and interact with anything outside the VR environment.<p>For your other point about the graph the system doesn&#x27;t have to pick out the best on its own. Just having the possible values and the results displayed the user could pick which one achieves their goals best. For his light following robot though there&#x27;s a pretty easy way to evaluate the parameters, how far is the robot from the light, that is a simple function and could easily be programmed.<p>The integration of the whole room and how you get the robot to automatically do many runs with different parameters, for the viewing across possibilities, is where I think a lot of the difficulty lies.

It&#x27;s refreshing to see the governments of major powers unite in order to enshrine protections for their citizens.<p>It really paints a stark contrast with the USA-Russia-China totalitarianesque power bloc, though. Our government in the US is currently weaseling out of net neutrality while strongly pushing for omni-surveillance in addition to the usual drumbeat of anti-liberty measures in the name of security. Here, the message is that you have no privacy from the state, and if you want privacy from the corporate branch of the state, you&#x27;re probably a criminal.<p>I really wish we could point to this and shame our politicians into following suit.",1402585244

7011048,comment,7008955,7008955,2,0,upofadown,,,"Traditionally a &quot;hacker&quot; was someone who was obsessed with mastering computers to the extent that it was the most important thing in their life. I once had a friend complain about the time wasted in eating, sleeping and having sex, time that could be better spent in recreational programming. I once had an instructor that partially solved that problem by subsisting entirely on 7-Up (a type of soft drink). He almost died as a result.<p>So using that definition, being a hacker is a type of seriously negative affliction. No one chooses the hacker lifestyle. The only good aspect occurs if you &quot;recover&quot; and find you can make a living programming for others. Pre-recovery, hackers often deliberately work in low level non-technical professions.<p>There is a sort of low level legend that straight women are immune to this sort of condition. Interesting if true. Such a revelation could result in some much needed reverse discrimination. There is nothing worse than accidentally hiring someone with a hidden overriding agenda for a programming position.",1388843939

In an environment where the myth of the genius is alive and kicking, taboos need to be broken to qualify for the label, though it&#x27;s not always important what those taboos (social or otherwise) are as long as you have some worthy advocates.\nA lot of this labeling is done in hindsight, unsurprisingly, and it&#x27;s going to become more tame as the definition gets generalized and romanticized. Even the coding part is slowly becoming less important, as shown in some of the posts and links here. Eventually there will be some other club to place the exceptional in. We can pretend there&#x27;s no value judgement in calling someone a &quot;hacker&quot; all we want, but that doesn&#x27;t ring true.

7011039,comment,7008955,7008955,3,0,GarvielLoken,,,"This article strikes me to centrer around concepts such as &quot;impressionable&quot;, &quot;self identify&quot; or &quot;feel like a hacker&quot;.<p>1. The author tries to blame society ( everybody except herself ) for not noticing the field of computer science. This is a very strange statement. Anyone using a computer must realise it didn&#x27;t appear on the earth from god almighty him self. \n&quot;stumbled upon opportunities early on&quot; here again the author is trying to blame the society for the personal problem of a lack of willpower and curiosity for finding out how computers works, instead she comfortably chooses to say that the society did not do its part.<p>2. &quot;Still, I imagine that this is unfortunately more common among women due to the ongoing sexism surrounding the field and the effects that this has on young, impressionable women.&quot;. Again with the personal lack of willpower. Being impressionable is a personal problem and the solution is not stopping to peruse an interest. Frankly I don&#x27;t have any sympathy for anyone who refuses to do their own analysis of a subject and instead trust and conforms to other peoples view on the matter, which is what being &quot;impressionable&quot; is.<p>3. &quot; In addition to being unable to self-identify with the &quot;hacker&quot; stereotype,&quot;. This is at the heart of the authors argument, &quot;unable to self-identify&quot;. How on earth can this ever be a problem? What does it even mean? She wants to erase her personality and become a profession completely? \nIf you like something I assume you are interested in the technique, art or science of the sport or hobby. Not because you want to &quot;feel&quot; like a practitioner of that sport/hobby? I really can&#x27;t understand an argument that is based on how much you feel like a practitioner. If you are doing something you are doing it because you enjoy it or find it fascinating.<p>Every child will during upbringing become exposed to computers and if they are interested they will ask as how they work or how the programs are made. Anything after that is a pure personal problem, a willpower issue. Blaming others for ones own failings is not a valid argument and I wont respect it.",1388843660

7011033,comment,6990354,7009029,1,0,betterunix,,,"I do not see how distributing keys is &quot;tricky&quot; in this context.  If you do not know who you are communicating with, then a man in the middle attack works if the attack occurs during your first attempt to communicate (think SSH); this would seem to be true regardless of the existence of a ledger, since you need to figure out which username you want to communicate with.  If you do know who you are communicating with, you can distribute keys offline (e.g. &quot;contact me with $key&quot;) or establish keys via some existing communication channel (OTR, PGP, whatever), just as you would have to distribute your username offline or via another channel given the ledger.<p>So sure, I can grant people are more comfortable dealing with usernames than with public keys, but that sounds more like a UI problem than a technology problem.  People are certainly capable of dealing with Tor hidden service addresses, and I suspect that is because they are already using a UI they know well (their web browser).",1388843389

7011030,comment,7009414,7009668,2,0,scott_s,,,"It looks to be inspired by CMU&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Computer Systems&quot; course (<a href""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/</a>). The professors who teach that course wrote a textbook, &quot;Computer Systems: A Programmer&#x27;s Perspective&quot; (<a href""http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/students.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/students.html</a>).<p>I was a TA for a year for a version of that course adapted to the school I did my PhD at. We did the same thing: this course became the required one, and OS became an elective. I was skeptical as well, but after TAing it for a year, I think it is absolutely the correct thing to do. This course instills an understanding of the whole stack of a computer system that exists in user-land: assembly; how programs are executed including the stack, data segments, dynamic memory; code generation; process management and concurrency; memory allocation; network and server programming. The point of the course is how different levels of the system interact, not just studying one component in isolation. It is the kind of course I wish I had as an undergrad; instead, I had to build that knowledge piecemeal during grad school.<p>More people will do user-land systems programming than kernel systems programming, so I think it makes sense to make the user-land course required, and the kernel level one an elective.",1388843345

The technologist likely believed they were communicating effectively, because funding sends a strong signal of support and agreement.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that this feedback was inaccurate.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that the listeners were incompetent or unqualified, any more than it means that the technologist was incoherent.  The trouble here was the lack of accurate feedback.<p>As such, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the FT&#x27;s tone (too much blame on the technologist) or many of the HN responses (too much blame on the listener).

7011005,comment,7010449,7010959,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> While they are definitely designed differently, TCP/IP only coalesces OSI layers to make programming simple for the task at hand.<p>But it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> except if you use the cliff notes version of the OSI model.  That&#x27;s my point.  Otherwise, H.323 would look like SIP, which it doesn&#x27;t.  Protocols designed for an OSI model look <i>fundamentally</i> different than protocols designed for a TCP/IP model.<p>Let&#x27;s look at H.323 since that is the example I am using.  The protocol is a beast to work with over TCP/IP because it was not designed for that.  It was instead designed for a unified OSI network where virtual circuits could be requested to handle voice and video information.  Those don&#x27;t exist in TCP/IP which has <i>no</i> concept of a virtual circuit and so over TCP/IP, you use a new TCP connection everywhere you&#x27;d use a virtual circuit because that is the closest equivalent.  It isn&#x27;t really an equivalent however which makes the protocol very, very difficult to deal with in terms of firewalls, etc.  Compare with SIP which just passes everything across a single TCP connection hitting a well known port.<p>The difference here is that the basic assumptions of what the network <i>can do</i> are different.  TCP/IP assumes at its basis that you have a simple, dumb packet switched network that really isn&#x27;t capable of doing anything else.  OSI assumes you have an intelligent network capable of routing packet-switched and circuit-switched information together.  They are <i>totally different design criteria</i> and <i>at best you can say TCP/IP is a very narrow subset of what OSI is designed to do.</i><p>What this means, effectively, is that you either have to strip down the OSI network in theory to match TCP/IP (which is useless) or you end up with something that doesn&#x27;t really match.  Either way there is no way of understanding H.323 without understanding the OSI model to a level in which the fundamental differences with TCP/IP matter and that requires knowing the basics not only of packet-switched networks but also circuit-switched networks too.",1388842814

It would be on the CBC and especially something like this would be very hard to pull off. Here is why:<p>1. Obvious environmental concerns about oceans and fisheries.<p>2. The conservative base is pro-government regulation of fisheries.<p>3. The conservative base is sentimental, and destroying first copies of anything would piss them off.<p>4. Newfoundlanders (man is it hard not to write &quot;Newfies&quot;) gave up a shit ton of prosperity after joining Canada by having the government come in and regulate their fish stocks. (To be fair, they didn&#x27;t have much choice. If they had kept going there would be nothing left in 5 to 10 years. No I&#x27;m not exaggerating it was fucking bad.) For the conservative government to do something that widely flies in the face of that would be to piss off an entire province.<p>5. The government is under a lot of flack by gutting the census and by muzzling federal employed scientists, this would make voters across Canada balk.<p>6. Canada is fighting off illegal Chinese and Portuguese fishing boats. These libraries contain information that is useful if we&#x27;re ever going to get reparations from them.<p>7. No clear motive for doing so. It isn&#x27;t like big oil has made a giant spill and the conservatives are trying to cover up the environmental damage or anything.<p>8.

Our original feelings of shock that the records were there and in such bad condition led to feelings of joy that they were still there and that someone had thought to retain them for us to discover so many years later.<p>Each book or box opened produced a new treasure. A letter, stamped and in the original envelope, from a Franklin County soldier serving in France during the First World War asking the court to be sure his sister and his estate was looked after while he was away. A naturalization paper from the late 1890s for an immigrant from Russia escaping the tyranny of the Czar. A document from County Commissioners in the early years of road building requesting another county repair their road as it entered the county. Lists of county employees and what their wages were in 1900.  A court document paying the court reporter who took the depositions in the “Sweat Ward” case, (Ward beheaded a man in the 1930s and later became the last man to be lynched in the county).   Postcards, county bills, audits, cancelled checks, newspaper clippings, store ads from long gone businesses.  Boxes and boxes of court cases covering the years of prohibition, a docket from an individual accused of running a “baudy house” within the city limits, a photo tucked now and then inside a book, one of the courthouse unseen since the 1920s.

7010927,story,,,4,2,Nurdok,"Ask HN: How do you split work on web apps?",,"About a year ago at my workplace we decided to get into developing a web app for internal use (as part of a more intricate system which is irrelevant to this question). No one really had experience in web development, so probably some of our decisions were wrong, but all in all we&#x27;ve had success with the tool we were developing. Since we did have experience developing in Python, we chose Django as our platform.<p>My question is about &quot;who does what&quot;. The way we split our work was: there is one team which handles all the Python code - which means all the Django urls, views and models, as well as the actual backend to handle asynchronous task execution (something a bit like Celery). A different team (more precisely, a single person in a different development group - but this is just implementation) is responsible for the templates (data binding), javascript, design, HTML, CSS, etc.<p>We have been working like this, as I said, for about a year now. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe the line of responsibilities between the two teams is wrong. The reason is that there&#x27;s a pretty big overhead whenever we need to interact - which is a lot. For example, when we add a new table and we want to display it, we need to let the &quot;frontend guy&quot; know what the url would be and what it would contain. Then we need to integrate out work to see if everything&#x27;s alright. Sometimes we didn&#x27;t pass enough context to the template to make it work and there&#x27;s a slow ping-pong of information between us.<p>So my question is this - what is the accustomed way to split work on web apps? Who takes care of the different modules - models, views, urls, templates, design, user experience, HTML, CSS, javascript? I&#x27;d love to know how YOU do it.",1388840506

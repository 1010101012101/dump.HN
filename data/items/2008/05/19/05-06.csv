193878,comment,193545,193758,0,0,breck,,,"Agreed--from experience. It hurt when our startup failed(after initial success), and really hurt for a few months. Laying people off (mainly ourselves), shutting down the business....it's very deflating. You hear statistics like ""90%"" of startups fail--but you don't hear much else about failure. Rarely are the gory details revealed. On the other hand, <i>every</i> success is well documented and the intricate detailed are talked about ad nauseam. It's very rare to talk about failure with anyone at these Startup Events, IME.<p>One thing I can say about failure: being young definitely helps. We had a lot less to lose than older people and plenty of opportunities to do different things when that didn't work out. It wasn't easy to fail but I've bounced back and am happy working in the non-startup world(though I've still been working on side projects still, mostly for fun).",1211176273

The people I met during my brief stay there seemed as happy as anywhere else. Then again, I didn't meet many people because it was too cold to go out most of the time.<p>BTW, don't be fooled by this whole ""iceland is warm and greenland is cold"" thing. Iceland is very, very cold. There's nothing to break the wind on the volcanic lava...it was the coldest I've ever been.",1211175477

But, would it be better practice to force yourself to raise a real angel round?

Take NewEgg. Is that from Egghead? They say not (probably for legal reasons) but there is nothing special about their name until they made it a brand. If you product is compelling enough, you could call it polished turd and it would be a success. Can anyone here come up with their favorite successful business with a crummy name?",1211174131

They should be concerned about staying relevant to their users, not controlling where they do and don't go.<p>The platform is great and all, but what is FB itself doing to keep me engaged?  Why aren't they pushing video harder?  Where is music?  Why does Facebook lag so far behind MySpace in both these areas?",1211173552

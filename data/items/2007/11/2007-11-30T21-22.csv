85119,comment,84721,84872,0,0,Retric,,,"This seems a little narrow minded.  Many highly talented programmers find a lucrative area and stick with it for a while, but they can pick up on the ""new big thing"" almost instantly.  <p>IMO it all comes back to talent and drive which are almost impossible to judge in an interview but they tend to swamp all other factors over time.",1196459815

85114,comment,84985,84985,0,0,Readmore,,,"I've wanted to do something like this for awhile. I think the better way to go is to incorporate this into a new web browser. Put in an algo to generate a 3d space for a website from it's html but also allow site owners to build specific 3d versions which are specified in xml. <p>That way you can browse the entire web in 3d (although pages with pictures would look more interesting than say... Newsy ;) and stores, game companies, whomever can create fun 3d worlds for their visitors. <p>If you could do some clever look ahead you could even make links into portals that show you what the next page is going to look like in 3D. So if you link me to a World of Warcraft page I can look through the link and see what that site looks like. Walk my avatar into the portal and I'm on a new website.",1196459540

85108,comment,85053,85080,0,0,downer,,,"<i>""Most venture backed investments fail because the venture capital is used to scale the business before the correct business plan is discovered.""</i><p>Read: Scale up before they have the income level to justify it.<p>Being ""nimble"" or ""adaptable"" in this case is simply another way to say ""didn't run out of money before they started making enough income"".  <p>Being large doesn't necessarily make you less adaptable.  Think of how many directions Google can explore <i>because</i> it is large.  They are far more adaptable than most small companies.<p>Companies that are composed of only two or three founders don't have the skillsets available to them that larger companies have; Google has a bagful of tricks <i>because</i> it has bought up <i>so many</i> of these one-trick ponies.  A lot of them probably were in the category of not having monetized their startup even to the point of self-sufficiency yet -- let alone to the point of making a profit -- and being acquired by a large company was the way to stay alive.<p>Before ViaWeb was bought by Yahoo they almost ran out of money; they had to borrow a conference room at Yahoo <i>in the middle of negotiations</i> to get enough money from another investor to stay alive.  Would you say they weren't nimble or adaptable if they hadn't gotten that last-minute financing?  Are they nimble and adaptable <i>just because</i> they got that financing?  Or is it that <i>despite</i> how quickly you can change directions, you eventually have to PICK <i>some</i> direction to keep going in if you want to get anything accomplished?<p>It doesn't matter how adaptable you are, you can only explore so many directions before you run out of money.  Some people <i>don't</i> change their idea, but they are able to keep pushing and pushing until they finally make it.  Some people get lucky and succeed on the first try.<p>Paul says, ""When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously.""<p>Thus, ""If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html</a>

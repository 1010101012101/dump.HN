The main problem is that these type of interviews expect you to master the skill of talking, thinking, and coding simultaneously.  The reason given is to &quot;see how you think&quot; but there&#x27;s no reason this must be in real-time, questions could be asked after allowing the candidate some quiet privacy to work on a solution.  To illustrate the main issue, replace the whiteboard with a computer connected to a projector instead.  The main issue is still there.  A group of engineers silently sitting there, judging, watching every move, and expecting you to keep talking while thinking and coding.  This is NOT how programmers work.  Most programmers sit down, think about a problem silently, then try out a few quick code snippets to explore the problem, then create a design, and then begin coding.<p>It would be a huge improvement if companies just gave the candidate a problem, left the room, and came back an hour later.

If compute time was more of a scare resource developers would spend more time writing correct code instead of iterating until something works.<p>I don&#x27;t mean that all developers code poorly because of the decrease in the time of the iteration loop but I feel that it does lead to poor code in the general case.",1430783052

9489992,comment,9489204,9489204,0,0,exratione,,,"Thus the whiteboard coding exercise has materialized for me perhaps twice in the past decade, and both times have been a reminder of just how terrible it is as an interview strategy.<p>It is Slow, Slow, Slow<p>I am actually greatly in favor of short programming exercises as a framing strategy for interviews. A sort of ersatz pair programming is the way I like to interview candidates: dive straight in with two seats at a machine and get to know the fellow over the course of either a bug hunt on the system he is being hired to work with, or if that&#x27;s impossible for legal or other reasons then some small, fun coding exercise. Such as, say, &quot;implement the world&#x27;s worst way to represent and then reverse a linked list,&quot; or anything that starts with &quot;you have an infinite tongue floating on a lake of a coffee and a piercing tool...&quot;<p>Ditching the keyboard in favor of a whiteboard dramatically increases the time taken to evaluate any one shard of the programming experience, however. What can be accomplished neatly with a simple text editor in ten minutes can take a painful hour or more with a pen. Whiteboarding is simply not suited for the exploratory way in which most people code. All that wasted time would be put to far better use in talking, asking questions, and more deeply exploring the interviewee&#x27;s approach to coding as a profession - touching on the many, many vital aspects of being a developer that cannot be tested in an hour with a text editor and a compiler.<p>Whiteboarding Primarily Tests for the Ability to Whiteboard<p>Most folk don&#x27;t spend their lives working on how to most efficiently and effectively use a whiteboard. There are good reasons for this: we have computers now, with editing and presentation software that is ten thousand times more useful and functional than the combination of pen and whiteboard. Why would anyone choose to practice and optimize a skill that is never going to be used in the ordinary course of their professional life?<p>Nonetheless, there exist a small number of people who can whip up really great presentations on a whiteboard from scratch, even over the course of a discussion that swings around all over the map, and has no predetermined outcome. These talented folk will make great use of space, have little need to erase and redo, and will generally look good while doing it. But guess what? That skill, while very occasionally useful, has absolutely nothing to do with code or programming.<p>Most people, given a whiteboard and a free-ranging discussion or problem to solve, will produce an ugly-looking hash of notes and require frequent large-scale reordering of the content on the board to make sense of it all. If you weren&#x27;t there, it might as well be Hebrew or hieroglyphics. If you were there, it still requires an additional investment of effort to follow what is happening - effort that might otherwise be going to more productive interview strategies.<p>Erasure and Exploration are Punished Aggressively<p>People are very individualistic when it comes to that aspect of development that involves the choice, design, and implementation of algorithms - the sort of thing that might take a few minutes to an hour and will typically be just a small part of a larger task. There are as many different approaches as there are types of personality. For my part, actually writing code is exactly equivalent to thinking about the problem: I plunge in and start writing, as that is the process by which I get a handle on what the eventual solution has to involve and how it will be organized. I&#x27;d guess that I probably write at least two to three times as many lines of code as eventually exist in any given small solution, and it is the rare module that isn&#x27;t aggressively refactored or otherwise turned inside-out at some point within the first thirty minutes to an hour of its existence.<p>In a text editor, this is a very rapid process. It goes about as fast as I can type. On a whiteboard? Not so great. Forcing code away from an editor and into a whiteboard is, I think, a great way to sabotage anyone who approaches programming in a rapid, iterative, and exploratory fashion. The whiteboard favors instead that mythical beast, the programmer who assembles the whole solution in his head, perfectly visualized, and then just writes it down.<p>But where&#x27;s the fun in that? If that was the way I coded, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be doing it for a living, or writing software in my own time. Rapid exploration and thinking out loud in code is a key part of the process of development at the small scale - of exploring any particular modestly-sized problem space. Of course this is all very different from the strategies apply to a larger scope of work, or software architecture, or the planning of complex integrations ... but then you aren&#x27;t going to manage to see the nuts and bolts of any of that via a short coding exercise.<p>Small Problems are a Tiny Subset of Programming as a Profession<p>The only thing you have time for in any coding exercise, but especially when whiteboarding, are tiny challenges - minuscule slivers of the vast programming experience. Just playing the odds, the ability to generate an algorithm for a small isolated problem is likely neither the most important component of the job, nor in any way related to the actual strengths or weakness of the interviewee as a programmer. What about planning, big picture thinking, documentation, writing skills, foresight, innovation? And so on, for as long as you care to make the list.<p>Further, the artificial whiteboard environment is far removed from anything approaching a real development environment. Every developer works within a halo of resources, local and online: the IDE, Google, Stack Overflow, and so forth. They are surrounded by an ethereal library and the means to use it - a primitive exobrain if you like. A large part of being a good programmer is being aware of and skilled in the effective use of this exobrain. Pen and paper coding exercises in this context are something akin to testing medical students by shutting them in a room with leeches, potions, and a patient, and expecting to divine something of their ability to perform in a modern hospital setting from the results.<p>Since whiteboarding is excruciatingly slow, by using it you&#x27;ve chosen to put the majority of your interview time into a poor-quality examination of one tiny facet of the programming experience, rather than freeing up time for other and better approaches.<p>&quot;But Several People Need to See What&#x27;s Going On&quot;<p>Ah, the group interview. So move the chairs closer to that gargantuan developer-sized monitor you have. Or request a bigger monitor. Or use a projector. I believe we&#x27;ve moved somewhat past the whiteboard as the only available technology for presenting content to multiple people in the same room at the same time.",1430782948

Or, worse, this person far overstated what the cited researchers claim<p>I think the &#x27;layperson&#x27; summary of this article should be that the authors may have found an unappreciated mechanism for gene expression [1-3; 3 articles were published simultaneously].<p>As you may have heard, your genome comprises four &#x27;letters&#x27;, called the DNA bases. Collections of these bases called genes encode proteins, molecular structures that perform myriad functions.  Indeed, everything that you can see on a living organism is either protein or was created by a protein.<p>Genes have specific functions that are often limited in both time and space - the protein encoded by a gene may only be needed in the embryonic pancreas, for example. In the field of epigenetics, researchers try to understand the causes of this tight control of gene activity, among other things.<p>The addition of methyl groups to DNA bases is a long appreciated way to control gene activity - see ref. 4, which is an excellent, freely available cell biology text. The DNA base cytosine is often modified to yield methyl-cytosine, a methylated base with a well established role in the regulation of gene expression; methyl-cytosine tends to mark genome areas with lower probabilities of gene expression.<p>The authors find that methyl-adenine seems to play a role opposite to methyl-cytosine, surprisingly. While the existence of methyl-adenine was known in bacteria, its function in gene expression in more complicated organisms was not known. Refs 1-3 don&#x27;t show a causative role for methyl-adenine in increasing gene expression but the correlations the authors report are likely to be followed up.<p>In summary, the story behind this article is pretty exciting and could indeed expand our understanding of epigenetics, cell biology and perhaps more.<p>One should remain <i>extremely</i> skeptical of anything in Science Daily - always go to the source.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415004274"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415004353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415004225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26854/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26854/</a>",1430782820

> An obvious enabler of police corruption is the fact that internal affairs units, tasked with exposing corruption, usually report to the same police chief that would be embarrassed by such exposure, and who may also be corrupt.  An obvious solution is to make internal affairs more independent, e.g., reporting directly to a city council or even a governor.  In the US the FBI sometimes serves in this role, though rarely at the request of local governments, and within the FBI its internal affairs still reports to FBI’s chief.  Why don’t more governments create independent agencies to investigate corruption, to assure citizens that corruption is not tolerated?",1430780845

But a lot of said impossible tasks are named so because of a lack of understanding and thus a difficulty in teaching.<p>So far music school way of teaching is by sitting you on exercises while someone verify the output. That is not teaching per se, it&#x27;s a black box system that has seen somehow regular results. Kinda like making glass, there&#x27;s a procedure for that, but what really happen at the molecular level is still blurry.<p>With time the student&#x27;s body and mind change and he gets skilled at it. How does he explain it ? does he have words to communicate his feeling to a newbie ? Never seen so so far. Recently some violin teacher was praised because he discovered non-linearity (the fact that inertia in normal speed gestures is not the same, thus learning technique requires you to fake inertia by allowing acceleration at slow speed, which means exaggerated movements). Still a shallow discovery to be honest. It doesn&#x27;t really describe how to create and sustain this kind of inertia between multilimb chains and how to attempt it pleasurably.<p>Back to code, similar issue is present when one of the most effective (and pleasurable) way to learn the art is by pair programming (with a mentor or even a same level pair). It shows that some notions are still not taught properly in schools. Maybe the system is already at peak and there&#x27;s nothing to change that would lead to better progress.",1430780719
9489813,comment,9487969,9489225,0,0,elithrar,,,"> The default Django CSRF protection is based on a hidden field, not cookies.<p>This is not true. The default Django CSRF protection uses cookies for the session store[1]<p>> What I don&#x27;t get is how is it possible to do CSRF with cookies?<p>The same as any other CSRF mechanism :)<p>1. You provide the user a (preferably per-request vs. BREACH) token, often in a hidden form field. The field being hidden is primarily for UX reasons.<p>2. You store a copy of that token in a session store. This is often a cookie due to the convenience of cookies (no server state required), but can be in a server-side store (memory, Redis, RDBMS, et. al).<p>3. Upon any non-idempotent HTTP method (anything that&#x27;s not GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) you compare the token in the submitted form to the value stored in the session.<p>The benefits are that you don&#x27;t have to maintain server state. The downside is that you&#x27;re transmitting your token over a channel at risk of MITM. Using authenticated cookies helps as any attempt to modify both the form value AND cookie value (i.e. so they match) should fail when you verify the MAC on form submission.<p>By default, Django&#x27;s cookies are authenticated.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/middleware/csrf.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/middlewa...</a>",1430780698

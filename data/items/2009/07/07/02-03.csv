690820,comment,688090,689215,0,0,gnaritas,,,"> Taking Ritalin to ""enhance work or study performance"" is getting high.<p>No it isn't.  No more so than drinking a cup of coffee gets you high on caffeine, or eating a candy bar gets you high on sugar, or drinking a bottle of Jack gets you high on Jack.<p>Getting ""high"" is generic slang for the consumption of <i>some</i> mind altering substances <i>for fun</i>.  99% of the time <i>getting high</i> specifically means smoking marijuana.  You do not label the taking of all substances as getting high, I'm not getting high if I take a percocet, I'm not getting high if I take a paxil, I'm not getting high if I take an abilify.<p>You can <i>tweak</i> on Ritalin by taking far more than the prescribed dose which people usually do by crushing and snorting it. This is not at all comparable to those taking the pill in the prescribed fashion in the same dose that one would take for ADD.<p>> What changed to allow us to use such different terminology for the same act?<p>What difference, you don't say an athlete is <i>getting high</i> on steroids, that's not what <i>getting high</i> means.  Secondly, you'll note we're against steroids because they're known to be very damaging to the user, not because they enhance his muscles.  If steroids were as safe as Ritalin they wouldn't be illegal and they'd be used by the vast majority of athletes just like every other legal substance they've found that works.<p>The terminology hasn't changed, you're just mistakenly thinking we use the same term for every drug and intent.  We never have other than the generic ""using drugs"".  Name a drug and there is specific lingo associated with that drug.<p>> And why should I not be concerned with changing social norms?<p>You should be aware of them, but not concerned because what other people do shouldn't <i>concern</i> you unless it affects you, I fail to see how it affects you.  Being <i>concerned</i> implies that you feel the right to object to the behavior and prevent others from doing what they want with themselves, that's what I'm objecting to.<p>Social norms change, that's life, they've always been changing.  If someone wants to take a pill - widely considered safe - to make themselves perform better, who's business is that but theirs?",1246935455

A bad sharded database can probably hobble your app, but a good one does get you remarkably close to true horizontal scaling.<p>In my experience, at least.",1246933916

I have a Bachelor's and Master's in computer science, am about a year away from a PhD in it, and I'm still not comfortable defining where exactly my field stands in regards to others. The best I can come up with is that it's a combination of math, science and engineering related to computation (the idea) and computers (the implementation).<p>The point he's trying to make with this statement - programs should be viewed as a natural expression of a solution, not a to-do list for a computer - is valid.

Biological science isn't at that point yet, and so what this usually means is that group A performs an observational study, group B finds a process that would explain group A's results, assuming group A's results are true. That's different from showing that group A's results were true.<p>Human, and animal, physiology is very complicated, and it's just plain wrong to assert that we know that eating meat decreases longevity. We don't. There is some evidence to believe it, and some evidence to not believe it at this point (both epidemiological studies and at the molecular understanding of the processes involved).<p>Epidemiological may be persuasive, but it's misleading because you take a single variable out of hundreds that may not even be known. So you may get Texans who become vegetarians based on longevity studies in some region of China, but then live an even shorter life because their lifestyles and the particular vegetarian foods that they eat aren't as conducive to longevity.

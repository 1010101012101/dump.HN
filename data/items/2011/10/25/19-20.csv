3155621,comment,3154913,3154913,5,0,lukifer,,,"The current conventional wisdom is that the birth rate is slowing in the industrialized world, and so overpopulation is no longer a serious concern. While this is the current demographic trend, I feel that such an assessment is short-sighted.<p>Natural selection (and common sense) tells us that individuals and cultures who value large families (Mormons, Catholics, etc.) will gradually out-populate those which do not. And as people who desire many children begin to make up a larger proportion of the population, it seems likely that overpopulation could resume its exponential trajectory.",1319572794

Sure, we can try, but that doesn't mean that we can override them.</i><p>Given that you could view large parts of human culture as semi-successful overrides of instinctual behaviors, I'm not entirely sure what kind of thing your thinking of that might not be possible even in principle.

3155619,comment,3154128,3155284,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I did read your post and watch your video. It's an interesting idea.<p>FWIW, if you had an interface like that to generate a quick template as a <i>starting point</i> for a privacy policy, which I could then download to customise for my own business needs, and it was available for a modest fee per use, then that would be interesting.<p>However, I wouldn't be interested in any sort of ongoing relationship/subscription deal. I'd see this as a one-off job. If the service were cheap/easy enough, it's a one-off job I might come back to do again for any new sites or policy updates later, though.<p>The result would absolutely have to be some sort of text document or HTML+CSS package that I could download and modify myself, not a link back to your site. This policy has legal implications in Europe, as I'm sure you're aware, and having it hosted by third parties so my users are seeing something beyond my direct control would be a  deal-breaker.<p>The UI itself looks very clean and easy to use, if you could only fix the lag/endless spinners that seem to come up all the time. To me, those would make it painful to come back and use over and over again, even if I used it once to get a starting point for my first privacy policy.<p>I stand by my earlier view of your launch process, though: This sort of service could have value I would pay for if it were relatively cheap (compared to my time and any legal fees it saves) and something I could just use instantly when I needed it. However, there's no way I would mess around waiting for it, and all that silliness with forced viral marketing looks like a social experiment rather than a service that's there to benefit me as a paying customer. Perhaps you've decided that this doesn't matter if you're not planning to continue with that approach once you've launched and are open to everyone?",1319572776

Valve is a rare case where both are one and the same, making them a very weird exception, but in general, direct distribution is bad for publishers (which is a good thing). It's really the same as with the (major) labels.<p>>Imagine how much Portal 2 cost Valve to make, was it worth it?<p>Valve is also a rare case in that they still make games worth playing.

The population then decreases (possibly due to starvation or disease), and begins to cycle around the carrying capacity, creating an equilibrium.

When a company is just starting out with no product and no funding, the value of the business is very low (more or less just the founding team's value). In this situation, the company is likely worth a couple hundred thousand to a couple million tops. 33% of that is likely in the hundred thousand dollars range.<p>Once the company has a product, funding and some traction, the business' value is now likely at least a few million to tens of millions. 1-2% of that is also in the hundred thousand dollars range.<p>Yes, the founders' stake is now significantly more, but it wasn't when it was granted.

Internet, Tech, Social Media, guides, hacks, etc - Like Mashable or Readwriteweb\n2. Startups, Entrepreneurial & Business news, guides, advice, etc - Like Techcrunch\n3. A service for early phase startups (currently working on building this)<p>Originally I was going to combine idea 1 & 2 into a single massive news & info blog, but several people told me they would probably market better if they were more niche and separated, connected by a network at the bottom like gawker media. Otherwise there might be too much unrelated content.<p>So I was going to reluctantly split them, but then came up with the service idea.\nI figured combining the Startup Blog with the Startup service would lend more weight to the site and keep people coming back. \nBut since the Startup Service HAS to be the landing page, I run into the problem of monetizing the blog if it's not the primary focus (like in a subdomain or subfolder), combined branding, too little emphasis on the blog, or too little emphasis on the service.<p>Leaving them separate means I could market them better separately, but I'm afraid of losing the combined impact of one site.<p>What do you think?",1319569500

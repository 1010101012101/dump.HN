53587,comment,53327,53415,0,0,jdavid,,,"i have found more opportunity working in a cafe, and going out, than i have by working in an enclosed space.  I figure<p>2-3$ for breakfast (egg, cereal, organic milk)
lunch will cost (12$) at any reasonable panera, etc... and if i get something else cheap for the day, that means another day i can invite someone to lunch for a networking opportunity.
that leaves me with ($10-$20) for dinner.  eating just noodles does not work for me, i need to get some sort of carnivorous delight for a meal at least once a day, fish is like 6$ a pound and then you have veggies on top of that if you cook at home, or a sushi tray is like 8$-12$ for a small one.<p>At 28, I can not live like a freshman college student any more.  I just can't think on 1800 calories of carbs.  I need a more well balanced diet.<p>Am i wack for thinking this?

53584,comment,53414,53445,0,0,Darmani,,,"It really pains me to here so many give a knee-jerk ""Gmail is the best answer,"" as I quite strongly feel that that is no longer the case.<p>When Gmail first came out, I certainly would have agreed with that statement. When I first received a Gmail invite, I placed ""make Gmail address main one"" somewhere on my to-do list.<p>Since then, however, Yahoo has mostly-replaced Yahoo! Mail with Yahoo! Mail Beta, which I strongly feel is far superior to Gmail (and far, far, far superior to the Yahoo! Mail Classic). Its main advantage (but definitely not its only) is its GUI, which contains its own tabbing system, the ability to read an e-mail in an iframe merely by selecting it in the inbox, the ability to move between folders via drag-and-drop, and much more.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21_Mail#Yahoo.21_Mail_AJAX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21_Mail#Yahoo.21_Mail_AJA...</a>",1189550941

Having no newsworthiness, pictures contain boring, rehashed messages, and are dangerious because they stroke the group's ego with simplistic messages, and dangerious because they become the preferred submission over time, since they tend to falsely increase a user's confidence though no knowledge has been transferred, while original, analytical thought has been stimied.",1189550188

They knew a lot of smart people were trapped on the east coast, e.g. by family stuff, so they established an office here.  They put it in NYC because they already had an ad sales office there.  I think that was a mistake, actually; Boston is a much more Googly place than NYC.",1189550112

It's only text mode of course, but for the last 5 years or so I rarely had a real need for anything  more than text (and if such need arises, I just use the web access to the IMAP server or another MUA).",1189549298

Many apps do the same thing, offering In-App Purchases of &quot;Disable Ads, $0.99&quot;. People wouldn&#x27;t offer the option unless (1) they&#x27;re inept and illogical or (2) it actually makes money. I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s the latter.<p>And even then, people love getting rid of ads. Whether you&#x27;re blocking them with AdBlock Plus [3] or blocking things in a hosts file or firewall [4], or even just pirating things outright [I&#x27;m not posting a link to TPB], people hate having their minds filled with garbage.<p>It&#x27;s a waste of time, waste of space, and honestly will just disappear asymptotically.

9936082,comment,9935198,9935993,0,0,objclxt,,,"Nearly all of the ways we detect exoplanets involve indirect observation. Most of them are based on observing the star(s) in the system of the planet. The two main ways we detect exoplanets are:<p>* Radial Velocity - just as the gravity of a star effects a planet&#x27;s orbit, the gravity of a planet also has an impact on the star&#x27;s. It&#x27;s just this impact is extremely small. By measuring variations in a star&#x27;s movement due to the planet&#x27;s gravity we can both detect the planet and estimate its mass.<p>* Photometry - when a planet moves in front of a star it reduces both the brightness and spectrum of the light we perceive. By carefully measuring this we can determine not only the size of the planet, but also it&#x27;s chemical make-up - light from the star travels through the atmosphere of the planet, changing its spectrum in response to the elements present.<p>There are several other ways we can detect and examine planets, but nearly all of them are based not on observing the planet itself but its impact on much larger, detectable things that surround it.

Both because the new law may be prevented yet, and these types of laws are occurring simultaneously across most of the developed world. I&#x27;m not sure where a startup would flee to, to avoid them.<p>I might take the opposite tact here. I&#x27;d argue instead that startups should feel perfectly comfortable making the Netherlands their home, for all the positive reasons, and they should all focus on slaying these bad qualities. The Netherlands only has 17 million people, it&#x27;s still very possible to have your voice heard. A focused group of startups can probably still make a difference.",1437663405

There is a really great chapter about this process I think in the  &quot;The new Market Wizards&quot; book by Schwager, though it might be in the first book, &quot;Market Wizards.&quot;  The banks call all of their customers and get commitments for dollar amounts towards the deal.  Then they put together the paperwork and issue securities.  It&#x27;s kind of like a bond, but it&#x27;s technically a loan.  Each of those investors receive some sort of documentation that they own some piece of that loan and the bank (or some administrator) distributes interest payments to the holders.<p>The problem arises in the secondary market where initial holders want to sell their piece prior to maturity.  There is a long process by which they have to prove ownership and transfer ownership.  It&#x27;s kind of like the process of closing on a home where there is a title search and deed transfer.  During this period the buyer and seller are  both open to shenanigans from the other party trying to back out of the trade or change the terms.  It&#x27;s also very labor intensive and archaic.  If title was stored and transfered through a public trusted distributed ledger system then it could be done instantaneously with minimal effort.<p>As I said above, there is much more potential here, which makes bitcoin way more promising than just a system for recording and transfering ownership of assets.",1437663296

9935994,comment,9926345,9933466,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I can tell you right now that you <i>will</i> find a way to tackle all these problems. I know this because of the way you respond to criticisms of your work. There&#x27;s not a single hint of defensiveness in your response. Kudos to you for seeking solutions, not defending mistakes!<p>- On quantifying the benefits<p>This goes back to that fundamental challenge of deciding how you want to sell. IMO — and this is just <i>me</i> — trying to quantify aspects like feel is a fool&#x27;s errand. Feel is experience; communicate experience. How do you do that? I would focus on producing materials that appeal to the senses. Photos and video, primarily. Find ways to communicate the experience of using your product. Create visual associates with environments and traditions that your target buyer will identify with.<p>- On competitors<p>I like that you&#x27;ve recognized the problems with that copy. I would make an effort to acknowledge that your product is <i>different</i> than what these other companies produce. You want to create the feeling that there&#x27;s something better out there, but you don&#x27;t want to insult the buyer&#x27;s historical judgement. Focus on creating confidence, even when talking about competitors.<p>> If a person loves any knife they have, then it&#x27;s a good knife.<p>You have to find a way to work this statement in to your copy. It is a garage door sized gateway to selling against your competitor&#x27;s weaknesses. Your knives are designed to be experience; to be loved.<p>- On education<p>I&#x27;d break all this stuff up.<p>1) Knives 101 should not start with any content dedicated to knocking competitors. I would move that copy to a separate document titled something like &quot;What&#x27;s different about these knives?&quot; Then speak to the differences. Use language that speaks positively about your knives, but avoids explicit negative statements about competitors. Speak to the absence of the positive attributes your knives possess in your competitors&#x27; products.<p>2) When authoring your site&#x27;s education materials, start from an outline and drill down in to details. As the details emerge, a structure should appear. You&#x27;ll find lots of &quot;one of these things is not like the other&quot; moments. The content will naturally organize itself.<p>3) Don&#x27;t overdo the education portion on your marketing site. Maybe you need a separate resource for education. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to work with some really incredible marketers, and any time I insisted that I needed to educate someone, I got shut down. Hard. I know it&#x27;s a passion, but you may need to break it out in order for your marketing site to be effective.<p>- On markets<p>Maybe selling to chefs and home buyers is similar, but they strike me as very different. I would imagine that a chef is going to have a much greater depth of knowledge and feel for what they want. A chef will probably want to shop by steel type, because they will already be familiar with at least some of the types.<p>Your ability to execute on both through a single site will stretch the limits of simplicity. My business is business procurement. Care to venture what the the sell through rate would be if we sent a consumer through our business procurement process in order to buy something? I&#x27;m not sure if negative sell through rates are possible, but we&#x27;d give it a good run! Likewise with professionals (chefs) vs home buyers. I would expect that the pro is going to come to the table with far more knowledge than a home buyer. They&#x27;re not going to be compelled by an authenticity play. This is a tool for them. They&#x27;re likely to know what they want and will value the ability to quickly find what they&#x27;re looking for at a good price.<p>You&#x27;ll know whether I&#x27;m overstating the difference. You should make that judgement call though.<p>- On pedigree and tradition<p>Anyone who finds the pedigree and tradition elements of your product bullshit-y is not your buyer. They might speak loudly, but they&#x27;re irrelevant. Based on the feel of your site, I&#x27;m guessing that you don&#x27;t care to be Walmart or Target. The people who don&#x27;t give a shit about pedigree and tradition are going to buy a knife at a retailer. They&#x27;ll never value the qualitative aspects of your product, so you should discard their detractions.<p>- On videos<p>I think you&#x27;re headed the right direction. I don&#x27;t have any specific recommendations for you, unfortunately. The &quot;Man at Arms&quot; katana video is the most relevant thing I&#x27;ve seen to traditional Japanese forging techniques, but it&#x27;s not at all appropriate for your site. Too bad the &quot;The Birth Of A Tool&quot; video isn&#x27;t traditional Japanese. That&#x27;s exactly the kind of video I would shoot for when selling to consumers.<p>I think your overall idea and product selection is really spectacular. One of my brother-in-law&#x27;s went to Le Cordon Bleu and is building a career in fine dining, so I have some exposure to his knife obsession :) If you&#x27;d like to keep in touch, feel free to email me.

Cell phones don&#x27;t generate that kind of radiation.  So it&#x27;s unlikely they cause cancer&quot; (paraphrase of a quote from the article).  That&#x27;s wholly unconvincing.  It&#x27;s assuming there&#x27;s only one mechanism leading to cancer: high frequency radiation.  We actually don&#x27;t know much about the relationship of low-frequency, low-power radiation and cancer.  More importantly, there could be a mechanism that is unknown to physics and biology which could make cell phones cause cancer.  For example, we do know, for a fact, that using a cell phone heats the tissue surrounding your ear, and that the body has known heat-damage-response pathways that when activated, lead to tumors.  So that alone is a plausible mechanism that should be studied further, presuming the epidemiological studies show there is some correlation between using a cell phone and having cancer, that can&#x27;t be more easily explained by other factors, such as lifestyle or other forms of exposure.<p>That said, the followup point about epidemiological studies is also pretty suspect.  The phone technology has changed dramatically over the years, and much of the studies are based on self-reporting.  No carefully controlled clinical trial has been carried out.  However, the studies that have been carried out do suggest, if not prove, that the increased incidence of cancer, if it exists at all, is a very small effect, barely statistically significant even in a well-controlled, high-population study.<p>Making policy like Berkeley is doing just isn&#x27;t supported by the science- there are far more risky things in Berkeley, like inhaling secondhand smoke on Telegraph or driving on Ashby.",1437661660

I had been engrossed with both the family Apple IIe computer and the fleet of Apple computers installed at my school, learning how to write BASIC programs. Wandering through the local shopping mall with my dad, we saw in the window of a software shop an Amiga 1200 running Lemmings.<p>I was awestruck. I started getting copies of Amiga-related magazines, and saw these amazing three-dimensional pictures of things like <i>balls</i> and <i>rubber ducks</i>. It was like gazing into the future.<p>Thankfully, my dad was likewise impressed, and within a few months we received delivery of a shiny new Amiga 3000. In anticipation of continuing my pursuit of programming, we got a compiler for an Amiga variant of BASIC, but I ended up focusing on two-dimensional graphics with Brillance, three-dimensional graphics with Imagine, and video editing with a variety of tools.<p>A friend at school picked up an Amiga 2000 and joined the multimedia production fun. It might be a good thing that we didn&#x27;t have YouTube back then, as we likely would have published all sorts of embarrassingly poorly-done animations and videos. We persuaded our school to buy its own Amiga computer for us to edit the student newsletter on, but we both left the school the following year, and it was reported that the Amiga got shoved into a storage space, never to be used again.<p>I tried hard to persuade anyone who would listen to get an Amiga. The IBM-clones and Macs of the day just seemed so flat-out inferior, I couldn&#x27;t imagine why anyone wouldn&#x27;t want an Amiga if they just realized what it could do.<p>I suppose I would have been happy to still be using the Amiga to this day, except that, after the demise of Commodore, it became increasingly (but not surprisingly) clear that support for the Amiga platform was dwindling. Some users have heroically clung to the Amiga even to this day, but even by 1996 or so it was looking prudent to move elsewhere.<p>Like remembering a corned beef sandwich from a deli you visited twenty years ago, I might be remembering the Amiga greater than it actually was. But even after thirteen years of using modern Apple computers (and iPads and iPhones and what-not), I still feel there was something magical about the Amiga that has not been captured in anything else.<p>Or maybe the Amiga captured something magical in me.",1437661607

9935892,comment,9933918,9935234,0,0,vidarh,,,"> Can you specify?<p>A few examples:<p>Datatypes lets most newer Amiga programs load any type of file of a format that people have written datatype libraries for. E.g. all image viewers and editors that supports datatypes (pretty much all the were still under development when datatypes where introduced) can load pretty much any image format you can think of without any explicit application support as people are still writing them. Datatypes support also exists for e.g. music, word processing documents and others. For some applications it makes sense to have their own custom filters for some formats, but datatypes provides a minimum level of support for even obscure formats, as well as continued support for new formats for applications that are no longer in development.<p>Similarly any app that supports XPK can transparently decompress and compress any compression format you drop a library for into the right directory (and in fact there&#x27;s a XPK datatype, that if installed lets any application that supports another datatype - such as for images, or documents - support compressed versions of the same).<p>Assigns is one of my favorites: Amiga applications typically load libraries from &quot;libs:&quot;. &quot;Libs:&quot; is a virtual directory that is the union of a set of paths that typically includes &quot;progdir:libs/&quot; (but doesn&#x27;t have to). &quot;progdir:&quot; again is a virtual directory that refers to the directory the application is installed in. It&#x27;s somewhat like $PATH, except you can create your own assigns, and lookups are handled at OS level. You can somewhat simulate it on Linux with combinations of various obscure filesystem drivers, but there&#x27;s nothing like the ease of use of assigns. Assigns are also given special treatment in filesystem dialogs/requesters, which meant that e.g. having a &quot;docs:&quot; and &quot;pics:&quot; assign or similar was common ways of creating shortcuts to the stuff you used the most, without needing any explicit support anywhere.<p>And these names also extends to volumes/labels of physical media. Think backup application that knows the label of the DVD you burned file X to. Want to restore it? Backup application could ask you to insert DVD labelled &quot;August 2014&quot;, or on AmigaOS it would just try to open the file &quot;August2014:X&quot; and AmigaOS will ask you to please insert volume &quot;August2014&quot; with no application support needed. This is admittedly a feature that was far more important when dealing with physical media was more common.<p>OS support for running controls/widgets (gadgets in AmigaOS) in separate threads ensures a high degree of responsiveness even when the machine is under high load.<p>Ease of writing filesystem drivers means you find stuff like FrexxEd - a text editor that exposes the open buffers as files, so that you can operate on the open buffers with any tools that can process a file.<p>Pervasive AREXX support meant pretty much <i>every</i> application can be fully scripted, either &quot;natively&quot; in AREXX, or from pretty much every language by talking to the applications AREXX port.<p>> what lessons are you talking about?<p>Decomposing applications and treating the system as a whole, for starters. For AmigaOS this was an absolute necessity: You wouldn&#x27;t have the space to effectively multitask on a machine with 512KB RAM if everyone needed to pull in huge amounts of different dependencies. So there was a lot more effort into standard components, or replacements for standard components, that allowed applications to do more with very little.<p>Not being wasteful, certainly. Above I mentioned FrexxEd. The custom filesystem in FrexxEd might seem like unnecessary bloat. But on a small system it meant that you did not have to write to a temporary file in T: which would commonly be assigned to RAM:T/ which would mean you&#x27;d suddenly have a second copy of the file in memory, instead of just processing what was already there. Similarly, the way cut and paste is implemented in AmigaOS is intended to be able to deal with efficient buffering to T: <i>in case</i> it has been re-assigned to a slow device (even a harddrive would have been slow enough to make the UI sluggish if you were to cut and paste a large chunk of data).<p>But the things that made these applications work well on such small machines also makes them blazingly fast on modern machines where UI&#x27;s are somehow still sluggish even when they don&#x27;t add much functionality (it&#x27;s another matter if a super-complex UI is slow)",1437661541

This is a not only high risk but <i>guaranteed</i> phenomenon with very high impact. Deaths due to nuclear accidents are generally estimated to be several orders of magnitude less than those due to coal in terms of deaths/KWH [1]. Even if we assume that these figures are off by 10000%, nuclear is still drastically safer than coal, even in the countries that have laws like the US&#x27;s Clean Air Act which &quot;plan around&quot; the pollution of coal (let alone places like China with no such regulation). We have so much leeway here that we can add nuclear accidents becoming 5x more common <i>per plant</i> to the 10000% error and still be competitive with coal.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-de...</a>",1437661028

9935840,comment,9934113,9935737,0,0,gh02t,,,"Yeah, the reactor went prompt-critical, which is pretty much the worst thing that could possibly happen. In the reactor normally there&#x27;s two classes of neutrons present - &quot;prompt&quot;, which are emitted directly from fission, and &quot;delayed&quot;, which are secondary neutron emissions from decay of fission byproducts.<p>Prompt neutrons are emitted on a very very short timescale and so if the power were controlled solely by them it&#x27;d be impossible to control a reactor because any change in the control rod position would cause an extremely rapid change in the power. Instead, reactors are designed to be subcritical considering only prompt neutrons and then be made critical via the remaining delayed neutrons. This extends the reactor period (time it takes for the power to change by a factor of exp(1)) from milliseconds to minutes.<p>However, if there isn&#x27;t enough control material in the core that the proportion of prompt neutrons is enough to make the reactor critical by itself then it goes &quot;prompt critical&quot; and exactly what happens in the article occurs. Reactors are <i>supposed</i> to be operated with enough margin that this won&#x27;t ever happen (which isn&#x27;t that difficult), but it sounds like they were deliberately operating right on the limit, which scares me.",1437660982

A significant chunk of energy usage is constant (base load), and there&#x27;s also a fraction that varies over time as everyone comes home after work and turns on their air conditioners and ovens (peak load).<p>Base load is ideally handled by an energy-dense approach that produces a very stable level of power.  Peak load can be handled with more variable sources of energy, but at the end of the day these are usually backed up by gas-fired plants that can be quickly spooled up to match demand.<p>The problem with photovoltaic solar is that its capacity undergoes a significant level of variance on both an instantaneous and a medium-term scale (time of day).  As such it&#x27;s best treated as a peak source.   Otherwise you need enormous, enormous batteries to try and smooth the load.  Using electric car batteries and so on is a good idea from the perspective of the utility, but it&#x27;s a raw deal for the consumer.  The lifetime of a battery is limited by charge/discharge cycles as well as time, and they&#x27;re stealing your cycles.  A replacement battery is an enormous chunk of change, it&#x27;s about the same cost as replacing an engine.<p>Note that this is not true of all solar techniques.  For example, there&#x27;s a solar-concentration technique that stores heat in molten salt, which helps to smooth out short-to-medium variation.  When you lose the sun, you get a smooth curve that deteriorates over a period of hours to days rather than an instant dropoff.  This is suitable for use as a base source.",1437660758

If we are counting only use and not intended use, then this just means that if a bunch of pirates (or worse) are your initial users then you are in the wrong.  That sounds absurd (though I could see a lot of people, in tech and otherwise, wanting to make Tor illegal because of one of its predominant uses).  But if it is based on intention, it still doesn&#x27;t differentiate between the technology being intended for legal use that may not different from illegal use, which is no less absurd.  Consider a tool that allows pushing apps onto phones.  It is intended primarily to allow apps to be pushed, but the tool has no way to check if the user pushing the app onto the phone has the legal right to push the app and the legal right to push software onto the phone in question.<p>It seems that making this a legal minefield that requires an existing well funded legal department is nothing short of regulatory capture.",1437660239

To clarify, I didn&#x27;t mean to insinuate that I thought anyone was necessarily lying; it&#x27;s more of a &quot;surprised&quot; weird.

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s inconsistent with Airbnb or YC&#x27;s account, I&#x27;d just never heard about it before (amidst a ton of lore about Airbnb&#x27;s early days at YC).<p>(b) Airbnb had the foresight to see that YC&#x27;s deal was better than yours. This would actually have been non-obvious in 2008: Dropbox was only a year old, Stripe didn&#x27;t exist yet, and YC&#x27;s best-known successes at the time would have been Heroku and Reddit. Not to mention the fact that you were offering them 10x the cash at 10x the valuation.<p>So it is &quot;weird&quot; in the way that history is kind of weird.

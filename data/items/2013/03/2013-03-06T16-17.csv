5332150,comment,5331387,5331387,3,0,LinaLauneBaer,,,"For a long time comments in code were considered as a code smell by myself. I only did comment my code if I had to say something about the ""why"" aspect of it. A few months ago I changed that and now I am back to commenting more than before and not only the why but also the how - of course not always but if there is a complex piece of code I will comment it. I do this even though I am using a language which produces very readable source code. Here is the why:<p>We are humans and we do communicate with our own language. Our brain is not made to read code. We are not a compiler who thinks in EBNF. Commenting the how is appropriate in many cases especially if you are not working alone but in a team. (1)<p>I really enjoy comments of people who are smarter than myself. Those comments (especially) helped me a lot to improve my own skills, to understand their code better and my feeling is that those essential comments make our code better - not worse.<p>(1) ""we/our"" = the people working in our startup",1362589117

It was great, except for this one guy named Smith (name changed to protect the lazy sumbitch). He would frequently email the team about how he wasn't feeling well, or how he wanted to concentrate on something important he was working on, or how he woke up so late that the commute wasn't worth it so he'd work at home.<p>That was fine and all, but then he would send emails about how he wasn't feeling well and was going stay at home, then show up for the after-hours company parties. He once sent an all-company email to invite others to watch videos with him in one of the meeting rooms during a Wednesday afternoon. I responded ""Wednesday <i>afternoon</i>? I think I'll be at my day job then."" To which he replied ""By Wednesday afternoon, I meant after 6pm. Technically, that <i>is</i> afternoon.""<p>My manager tallied up the days that he did this, and I forget the exact number, but they added up to more than 50 work days in 10 months. The policy wasn't specific about how many days you could work from home, so he was allowed to do this. Worse, others started to follow his example.<p>And yet, he was getting his work done on those days off, so no one fired him. But, his behavior annoyed everyone s.t. we called working at home ""Smithing"". I still showed up at work and put in my best, but it certainly was demoralizing to have to work with such douchebaggery.",1362589076

I believe this implementation is called a v-buffer, though I can't find any references right now but I am fairly certain I read about it a decade back.<p>Apple used this technique for their menus early on while Microsoft took the alternate route of using a delay which was quite annoying. A lot of power users removed the delay via registry settings and it was surprising why Microsoft didn't adopt the v-buffer--might be patents related?<p>The problem with the delay is not only the delay itself but for wider menus the delay needs to be even longer. Then to account for novice users, you add in a little bit extra just for good measure.<p>One way to mitigate long delays is to make the parent menu taller so the user has a bigger margin of error while they move the mouse horizontally to the right.<p>However before hi-res displays became common, vertical real estate was far more limited. On the earlier windows machines where you often ended up having two columns of menus, this was even more annoying because trying to get to the second column of menus required moving your mouse right, through the first-column's submenus. In later version of Windows, Microsoft did away with two column menus and introduced a single column with scroll up/down to solve this issue,but introduced further delay when trying to get to menu items below the visible screen.<p>(edited for grammer)",1362588701

However, some organizations, especially in English speaking countries, will honor it simply as a notice of infringement.<p>- If the individual sending the complaint is outside the United States, but the content provider is within the US, usually the content provider will cooperate anyway to protect themselves from legal obligation under Safe Harbor provisions.<p>- If the end user receiving the complaint is outside the United States and the content provider is within the US then the content provider should still honor the counter notice and would be covered by Safe Harbor provisions. I'm not sure on the specifics of this, however you must at minimum consent to the jurisdiction of US Federal Law for any further actions.<p>For the most part, the content provider / hosting company will do what is in their best interest to legally safeguard themselves, with little regard for end user rights. Generally speaking, the larger the company the moreso this applies.<p>Github seems like a reasonable organization, and if you submit a counter notification in valid format they should act accordingly.<p>Also, I see the Chilling Effects URL is getting hammered, here's a static version which you can modify: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Terrorism/form-letter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Terrorism/form-letter.html</a><p>While unrelated to this issue specifically, something which is interesting to note is that in a several year old paper from Vanderbilt University, they specifically mention a provision dealing with enforcing the DMCA on foreign websites. While this provision has never been used to my knowledge it does exist and is quite scary considering the implications:<p>While direct action against a foreign site is not possible in U.S.
courts, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) allows courts
to order the blocking of infringing sites. Section 512(j)(1)(B)(ii) (the
Foreign Site Provision) permits an order to restrain an Internet
service provider (ISP) from providing access to a specific, identified,
online location outside the United States. Therefore this provision,
with some limitations, may be used to block U.S. access to infringing

The authors did a historical analysis of a reasonably sensible retirement portfolio (50/50 stocks/bonds), and figured out the minimum rate of return you could safely assume over any 30-year period (even those including the Great Depression).  They also made some very conservative assumptions, such as that the retiree will continue increasing their spending every year by inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).  The answer: 4% per year.<p>This number commonly goes by the name ""Safe Withdrawal Rate"", or SWR.  You'll see that term quite a bit in discussions of retirement, especially early retirement.<p>Turns out that very little difference exists between the amount needed to sustain 4%/year for 30 years and 4%/year indefinitely.  The numbers also get better if you make a few less conservative assumptions, such as some flexibility in the amount you spend (buying fewer luxuries if another depression happens, for instance), or receiving any kind of additional retirement benefit later on (Social Security, corporate retirement), or various other safety nets that the study didn't cover.<p>In any case, if you don't feel comfortable with 4%, you can adjust it easily by working only a little longer.  For instance, in the previously mentioned case of spending 30% of your income, if you've already saved 25x your annual spending (so you can live on 4% returns), and you work one more year past that, you'll save another (7/3)x of your annual expenses and earn about 1x in returns, meaning you now only have to assume a ~3.53% return (1/(25 + 7/3 + 1)).",1362588280

When I first started coding, I used to comment my code in what I call the ""micro-comment"" format (comments that describe a single line of code). In my case, I had a project that I had to abandon for a period of few months. When I had to go back into that project to fix up some things, I couldn't anything, despite my micro-comments. I actually had to completely abandon a 20,000 line code base of a personal project because I couldn't read the code. That vivid experience of personally feeling the pain of my bad commenting is what taught me how to comment properly. I kept asking myself ""Why the fuck did I do that? What is this code doing? Jeez, these comments are not helping me at all"".<p>Now when I write things, I know to comment in what I call the ""macro-comment"". That is to say instead of writing a comment to describe a single line of code, you write comments to describe a block of code. Since that one project's fail, I haven't had that problem again.<p>Another point I want to make is that I really feel like my commenting skills are extremely valuable to me as a developer. I I had to have my brain erased, but I could choose one skill to remain, I'd choose keeping my code commenting skills. Its also the one skills that I care about the most in my co-workers. I don't care if you're really good at code golf. I don't care if you know haskell. Can you comment code properly? Whenever I interview for a job, I'm never able to demonstrate this skill. The Fizzbuzz problem doesn't allow me to show off my commenting skills. Writing a binary tree parser doesn't let me show off my documentation skills.

Being able to contact someone, get a root cause of an issue and get help to mitigate it is what is important.""<p>This.<p>This reminds me of the article about Heroku's ""intelligent routing"" and a discussion about scaling/scalability and performance.<p>We pay more for mitigating and reducing risks. Cloud services, particularly Iaas and Paas, such as Azure, AWS, GAE reduce (or are at least suppose to) the downtime when crap hits the fan and also enable more flexibility, speed, and agility in building out solutions.<p>The interesting part about the Heroku discussion pertained to the following:<p>Assume we have a straight forward, minimum layered architecture and that the average response time is 1.45 seconds. Using average responses times is a bad idea for determining true performance but let's continue for purposes of illustration. To get this average lets say 19 out of 20 requests return in 1 second, 1 out of 20 takes 10 seconds (Please correct me if my math is off/wrong). If we could add a layer that would shorten our long tailed curve that would be an improvement. However, adding a layer will incur some overheard. Lets assume for illustration purposes this layer will add 500ms to every request but will reduce the worst case from 10 seconds to 5 secords. So, 1 out of 19 take 1.5 sec, 1 our of 20 takes 5 for an average of 1.675 seconds. The average time is worse! However, the worst case scenario is much better. We've mitigated the costs of the worst case.<p>Using cloud services and vendors that have expertise and the ability to quickly address hardware issues is suppose to reduce the risk and cost when things go bad. Yeah you might have hiccups here and there that put you down for a few hours. But that is better than being down for days! It's really all about risk mitigation.",1362587620

What we do as business owners is easy to think of as an extension of ourselves.<p>In many ways it is an extension of ourselves.  Whether a business lives or dies is based off of our ability to manipulate it. Neglect it completely and it will fail. Don't start it and it will never exist.<p>But if you do think this way, it's first most important to take care of yourself.  Picking up smoking again reeks of stress left unchecked.  No sense of satisfaction from generally satisfying activities does too.<p>I know nothing about the Micah's business and what got him there, but from his post it feels a lot like what I've seen and what I've been through.  A lot of ""personal sacrifice"" for the business, a lot of feelings of pressure, a need to perform.  Essentially like an addiction to realizing goals; the fitbit example for instance - compelled to meet an arbitrary metric to the point that it causes him stress.<p>I think the best way to do anything, running a business or otherwise, is to first be cooperative and aware of yourself.  If you are judging your business as an extension of yourself, it's destructive to sacrifice yourself for the business.  If it's necessary, then do it with awareness; be cognizant of your actions and evaluate them to make sure they're still necessary.  Stress can be a great way to motivate yourself for short bursts, but in the end it's a negative influence, it will ruin your life and it will ruin your business.<p>When you live off stress, that's when you can ""hit rock bottom"" - that's when you realize that relying on all the stress in the world to motivate you still isn't enough.  If the stress doesn't help, why bother with it?  That release gives you a boost - stress impairs your ability to function as much as it compels you.  But I think it's important to take a lesson away from that - mitigate stress, monitor stress, and only use it occasionally.  Let stress be the thing that happens when the shit hits the fan, and forces you to knuckle down and get through it.  Be careful to never let it be the baseline again.",1362587270

This has been a development building within the PC sphere for years.  Not only that, many professional and countless more no-good hobbyist opinion-makers (like myself) have made this point over and over.<p>I'm nobody, but I have opined about this and the insipid taint of Good Enough several times [1].  Like ""api"" at the top of this comment thread, I feel there are bottlenecks that keep the desktop PC, and the laptop PC to a degree, constrained to the roles that we have presently envisioned for those devices.<p>My opinion is that desktop display technology is ultimately the root of desktop stagnation and, speaking positively, could be the root of a desktop renaissance [2].  I agree that bandwidth progress has slowed and storage capacity progress has slowed [3], but point out that only display technology has actually outright stopped and regressed.  In 2001, the IBM T220/221 monitor achieved high-DPI on the desktop (3840x2400 at 22 inches).  Since then, we banished high DPI from the desktop and obsessed about a marketing term named ""HD"" because we allowed the rules that govern our living rooms' displays to take over on our desktop.  That we accept 24"" desktop monitors with 1080 vertical lines in 2013 is heartbreaking.<p>I agree with api that bandwidth is to blame.  But bandwidth hasn't stopped progressing and regressed (well, with one exception: mobile data caps).  More importantly, I feel that behind the bandwidth complacency is display complacency.  Put a 40"" high-DPI desktop monitor on your desktop and I think the demand for ultra-high-definition content, high-clarity user interfaces, bandwidth, computation power, and storage capacity will all increase.  Intel sells more processors, HP/Dell/Lenovo sell more PCs, and oh-boy would I be so happy to finally get a real monitor upgrade.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/technology-sucks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/technology-sucks</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/displays-are-the-key"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/displays-are-the-key</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/boring-technology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/boring-technology</a>",1362586366

It's hard to say someone is better than anyone else for most people.<p>Everyone will generally be better than you at some things, and worse than you at others.  Consider why you're in the position to be hiring them in the first place, perhaps you're better at managing, or becoming well connected, or organizing talent.  In terms of programming maybe he's leaps and bounds ahead of you, but he still came to you looking for a job.<p>That's not to say I disagree with any of the authors points individually.  Just that I think that if you think of it strictly in that the new hire is better than you are, you are selling yourself short.  If instead you think that you are more management or entrepreneurial focused, and the person you're hiring is more technically focused and allows you to focus on your other skills then you don't even need that list.  You're automatically working as a team.<p>Programmers don't necessarily want to be managers.  If your role is becoming essentially a manager with minor programming duties, and you want to focus on business issues instead of technical challenges, when you hire an awesome programmer that gives both of you the best of both worlds.  You bring a lot to the table by being the guy that starts the business and secures the capital needed to be able to hire the programmer.  Regardless of your programming skills, this has no bearing on whether you are better or worse than the new hire.<p>But quantitatively you're probably better :)  You can always hire a different programmer, but if they thought they could make more money on their own they probably would have done it already.",1362585969

Given that these lovely shiny devices aren't going away (phew!), is there a technological fix to being tracked?<p>I mean, signals need to reach the phone so the location of the phone needs to be known. What is out there that could allow us to use this awesome technology without essentially handing our every waking movement to a 3rd party who can be easily forced to hand the data over?",1362585737

All we'd ever do would be to link to Authentic Jobs et al. My interest isn't in pulling traffic away from the existing boards; just helping people <i>find</i> the remote jobs more easily. And, if companies want to highlight their posts on Remojobo by making their posts ""featured"", that's great, too.",1362585726

I think it's because I'm a musician, I can't help but concentrate on it.<p>One other thing I've noticed about myself in this regard is that annoying noise irrationally enrages me when I'm trying to concentrate. For example when I'm working in my cube and a manager or maintenance guy walks by whistling, I really want to scream at them. Even if it's only for a few seconds. I ignore the feeling because I know it's totally irrational, it goes away and I don't actually feel any ill will towards people.<p>I've heard others talking about this kind of thing before so I'm pretty sure it's not just me. It's annoying because I'd like to be able to work around noise better, and I don't like being angry.",1362585607

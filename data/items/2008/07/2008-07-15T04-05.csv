For example right now if I want to connect into work, I fire up the Cisco VPN client, <i>then</i> I ssh from my Mac to whatever Unix box I want to work on there. I'm not sure that ""double encryption"" really buys us anything here. Unless someone's actually in our datacentre tapping the wire coming out of the VPN host, in which case we've bigger problems...",1216097708

246387,comment,245935,246363,0,0,nailer,,,"You asked what I specifically disagreed with. Your original post:<p>> the most common meaning of SFTP has come to be ""FTP encrypted with SSL""<p>I disagree with that. We both think people should use 'SFTP' to correctly mean as implemented by an SSH server, but you think the term has lost meaning. I am disagreeing with that.",1216097137
246386,comment,246115,246301,0,0,silencio,,,"I've said it once here already and I will say it again. I have not come across many Mac|iPhone developers who were unhappy with what they got out of WWDC, unless all they were doing all week long was getting plastered.<p>It seems like a complete waste of money to some, but when you consider what you can get out of it: the sessions, the seeds, the _signing up to talk to an apple engineer about your app to get help with virtually everything_, the session videos, the people you meet...it can and is well worth the money to attend.<p>There are some conferences I have been to that were mostly along the lines of ""what the hell is this *&#$"" where I've fallen asleep and skipped entire days, and WWDC is not one of them. It's definitely an experience I recommend to developers should they be able to afford the time/money it costs to attend. I'd even know of some that would say WWDC's cost is nothing compared to what it's saved them in terms of all the things they got out of it that they used.",1216097102

My extremely informal testing produced the following results taken by copying a random binary file I had to another computer:<p>SSH: 2.0MB/s<p>SSH w/ compression: 2.5MB/s<p>FTP: 2.8MB/s<p>While SSH does not approach the speed of FTP it does come close, perhaps close enough to finally ditch FTP altogether in most situations.",1216096978

Maybe other forums aren't quite as focused on the voting aspect (though it does exist). Some people see that as an advantage, though.

246363,comment,245935,246296,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You disagree with what?  I thought I was quite clear that the appropriate meaning of SFTP is SSH File Transfer Protocol and has been for years.  I certainly didn't think I was arguing that people ought to use it to mean anything else.<p>Many users (and a few clients and servers) <i>do</i> use the term incorrectly.  I don't like it, and clearly you don't either...I don't see what you're disagreeing with.<p>And, of course FTP over SSL is not extremely rare...not even close to rare.  All of the major FTP servers, and many FTP clients, support it quite easily, and many, many end users insist on it.  ProFTPd, possibly the most popular FTP server, can be configured to use it with just a few configuration directives.<p>I'm not encouraging anyone to use the terms incorrectly or to use the FTPS protocol instead of SFTP.  In fact, I've been recommending SSH FTP for <i>years</i> (one could probably dig up mailing lists posts that include me scolding people for using FTP from ten years ago).<p>I guess I've not been very clear.  I apologize for misleading anyone into thinking I intended to praise the misuse of terms.  I just wanted to point out that people use the terms incorrectly extremely often, and it's wise to be explicit about the protocol you mean.",1216094907

However, you got a free trial that was unrestricted, and at one point they offered me what was basically a free membership if I would just play games for a minimum # of hours per month.

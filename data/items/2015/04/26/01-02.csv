Depending on the country, there&#x27;s rumble that is from old buildings never repaired (e.g old colonial, or cheaply built concrete houses from better times), rumble from tin roofs in DIY shacks, etc...

9440234,comment,9439165,9439165,0,0,beloch,,,"When you watch The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, there are some pretty intense practical effects scenes that Sarah Polley had to go through.  In particular, I&#x27;d be leery of the combination of water, large animals, and explosives myself!  In fact, I&#x27;d probably want to be there as they were setting things up, asking countless questions until I was satisfied that all danger was illusory.  Even as an adult, this would likely have been hard to do in a chaotic production where everything was constantly in danger of spinning out of control.<p>Gilliam obviously did not have full knowledge of how Polley was feeling at the time, but her experiences offer a lesson for anyone who has to put a child in circumstances that are challenging.  It&#x27;s crucial to spend extra time explaining and educating them in order to defuse fear that they might not admit to.  Children have a lot of things they still need to learn, and one of those is when to speak up for themselves when they&#x27;re not comfortable. Polley was wise to have this discussion with Gilliam and, perhaps, wise also to make it public.<p>Directors often have too much on their plate to worry about the welfare of their actors and parents are probably afraid of interfering in a way that might harm their child&#x27;s chances to work in later productions. It&#x27;s sad, but Polley&#x27;s parents were her agents in a way, and had an incentive to prevent her from objecting when she felt she was put in danger.  Perhaps a third party advocate for child actor safety should be on set, but admitting this would be a bitter pill indeed for the parents!",1430013472

9440225,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,kinduff,,,"1 year ago I quit my old job as a web developer at a startup company in Mexico City. Had been working in multiple digital agencies, small and big ones and always doing freelance projects or personal ones in my spare time.<p>Had the opportunity to travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina for two weeks, so I asked for my paid vacations and that trip changed my mind. I&#x27;ve never travelled at my age (22), so when I was back and in only one month I quit my job and start selling all my stuff I bought for 3 years. In the meanwhile I started to look for more freelance projects, and just two weeks before I took the plane - I had already bought my ticket - one remote job position was opened for me. Lot&#x27;s of benefits like good salary and a brand new laptop, and they agreed that I was in another country and I was going to be traveling through all latinamerica.<p>One year since that, I was in Argentina for the whole year - I have really good stories. One month ago I arrived back to México, I still have my remote job position, I&#x27;m using my extra hours to have more freelance projects and I&#x27;m saving everything I have because I&#x27;m planning to go to Central America in August (Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panamá, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru).<p>The things I learned from this experience is that traveling isn&#x27;t that hard, you just need to plan ahead. You can decide what kind of traveling experience you want. My sister right now is bagpacking from Buenos Aires and she&#x27;s right now at Ecuador, she&#x27;s selling jewelry and food on each city she arrives. In the other hand, my kind of traveling involves a stable job, lot&#x27;s of food and a good place to sleep and work.

In my case I&#x27;ve done a few voluntary work trips, the longest I did together with my wife and it lasted a year. I always try to learn the language in countries when I stay more than a couple of weeks. It quickly breaks the ice when you work side-by-side with the locals, trying to speak their language. You may not get to see all the main attractions in a country but you get to see and experience much more interesting things.<p>However, I also agree with reddytowns. Traveling like that changes you. You&#x27;ll probably not notice until you return but it&#x27;s quite likely you will feel disconnected from your peers, friends and family. You have changed and they have not. I would recommend anyone planning to go on a long immersive journey to consider going together with some one you like and get along well with. Then at least you will have that connection when you get back. This is important since this disconnected state could very likely be permanent. At least that&#x27;s how it feels for me, it&#x27;s been almost ten years since my wife and I spent a year abroad and I&#x27;d say we lost something then that we haven&#x27;t been able to get back. We&#x27;ve spent nearly ten years back home, buying a house, raising kids and yet we don&#x27;t really feel like we belong in our own country with our own families.. maybe it&#x27;s just our personalities..<p>So in the end, would I recommend quitting your job and travel the world? I guess it depends on how well you&#x27;ll handle the disconnect. The fact that your own family may feel like strangers to you..

That&#x27;s a public facing media engine at best, not really used for &quot;government&quot; per se.  In fact, it&#x27;s likely not even homed on a DoD or GOV network.  Many of the media engine type sites in the government are outsourced to third party hosting.<p>You&#x27;d want to find something more specific, like perhaps a protected access web system, like a Sharepoint portal or website, or even a mail relay conveniently pointed out by an MX record.  Trace that system back and you likely will find either its reverse proxy, a front end system, or an SMTP entry point.  This gives you the parameter subnet (DMZ) that you can probe from there.  Then, using available DNS records, you could start mapping out the parameter looking for proxies, mail relays, and web servers.  If you had access to web traffic logs you could use them as well to look for egress points from networks.  If you had e-mail traffic to look at you&#x27;d likely see leaked internal subnets as well in the headers.  However, this would only work for services they have blessed for access to the public internet.<p>It is absolutely no different than how you&#x27;d map any other network.",1430012147

Again, I am biased, but I think that methods that do not have some statistical interpretation are unlikely to be useful.  E.g. if we take the graph of Facebook users and apply some matrix decomposition algorithm, who cares?  What can we do with this decomposition? What does it predict?",1430010415

You won&#x27;t get an epiphany on an all-inclusive trip; and I&#x27;ve seen people relocate across the globe and continue to live the same life they had back in their home countries. Trying to solve anything by running away is just that - escaping. It may work for a while, but at some point you&#x27;ll have to stop and face your demons.<p>PS. It&#x27;s not a matter of introversion, as I know plenty of introverts who can strike up a conversation with a stranger. I can&#x27;t, no matter how hard I try - and it gets awkward pretty fast if I try too hard. And yes, having social &quot;guide&quot; around does help - but it always feels like being a burden.",1430010381

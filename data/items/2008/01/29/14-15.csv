106161,comment,106149,106149,0,0,fleaflicker,,,"My favorite programming assignment in school was a Scheme implementation of the ""stable marriage algorithm"".<p>""Let's assume, for the sake of an argument, that you are a village matchmaker given the task of marrying\n100 men and 100 women. Each of the men has ranked the women from 1 to 100 in the order of his preference;\neach woman, not to be outdone, has similarly ranked the 100 men...Rather than insist that everyone get their first choice, you are instead charged with creating 100 stable\nmarriages. A set of marriages is said to be stable if there exists no man m and woman w such that m likes\nw better than his wife, and w likes m better than her husband. The notion is called ""stability"" as m's and\nw's marriages are unstable, since (albeit sordid and tawdry) m and w could optimize their sorry lot in life\nby leaving their mates and running off together.""<p>Non-PDF link:\n<a href=""http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:abZ7sCKHUmYJ:www.cs.brandeis.edu/~mairson/Courses/cs21b/marry.pdf&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:abZ7sCKHUmYJ:www.cs.bra...</a><p>Not the same as algorithms discussed in the article but fun and interesting.",1201618630

106157,comment,105435,105532,0,0,ralph,,,"Is it continuations you don't understand or their use in web apps?  If the latter then you can see them in use on this site when you click ""reply"".  You get a URL ending /x?fnid=bU389jXsk2.  That's a FuNction ID that allows the continuation to be eXecuted and run a bit further.<p>The site used to use them far more but because only the last N continuations were kept, at times of high load users would find the links on the page they were viewing broke on trying to use them;  the fnid they referred to had disappeared because N more had been created since.  One solution is to increase N.  However, any trivial means of generating another M fnids means it's easy for a single attacker to cause N more to be generated.<p>As troels says, RESTful is the way to go.  Continuation in my view are flawed for web apps.  AIUI pg got away with it for Yahoo Store because they were only used in the shop design side of things where each shop owner could be given his own N storage of fnids, isolated from others.<p>It's been discussed before on here, in particular a post by me around end of April/start of May 2007 that caused pg to email me privately about thinking up new ""ddos attacks"".  A while after that, most of the usage of fnids were replaced by conventional-style URLs so also some remain, M is smaller than it used to be.",1201618395

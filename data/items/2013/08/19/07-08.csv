D-notices are very British things - they&#x27;re a polite request to the media not to report on specific areas, and carry no <i>legal</i> weight.  The assumption is that as long as they are issued in good faith, then the media goes along with them and everyone&#x27;s happy because the security services don&#x27;t have to start lobbying for censorship powers.<p>Now, along comes a situation which looks a lot like an attempt at journalistic suppression by the state.  The incentive for the media to go along with any potential D-notice has evaporated because this is just censorship by other means, and if you&#x27;re going to censor us anyway, why bother with D-notices?  Issuing a D-notice over harrassing a journalist (via their family, in this case) would be something of a bodyliner, and I don&#x27;t think even the British press would have a hard time figuring out what to do about it.",1376898528

But the implication of all this is that learning <i>is</i> a skill, and that you <i>can</i> learn how to learn better. We may not yet thoroughly understand how generalized learning takes place in the brain, but it does seem to be a function of working memory and motivation, which can be improved. Generalized learning is segmented more finely than how I described it originally, but it still functions the same way (e.g. learning to juggle may not help you learn a new language better, but learning to play a musical instrument may help you to learn the other two more easily, since it incorporates language skills through music, and motor skills through playing). Making an argument against this model would place the burden of proof on that side, because as I mentioned before, there is no known mechanism that would lead to the outcome outlined by the &#x27;fair&#x27;/balanced model, and it would have to explain away phenomena like neuroplasticity that seem to directly oppose it.",1376898234

European languages)<p>As someone who watched a fair amount of anime with Japanese audio and has some very basic linguistic training, I want to comment on this idea.  It&#x27;s not totally clear what you mean by &quot;two sounds that are almost identical, and do not carry distinct meaning in Japanese&quot;, so you get some non-orthogonal untargeted thoughts.<p>The R and L sounds are in fact closely related.  That said, you, as a native speaker of a language distinguishing them, will do so with extreme accuracy.<p>A possible interpretation of your sentence is that the &quot;sounds are almost identical [...] in Japanese&quot;.  That&#x27;s not a particularly coherent idea (and I stress I&#x27;m not trying to attribute it to you); a Japanese speaker will hear them as the same sound, but may vary (in terms of what <i>you</i> would hear) from one extreme to the other in what sound they produce when they need that &quot;one&quot;.<p>If you listen to spoken Japanese (it will help to have a transcript of what&#x27;s being said, since I assume you don&#x27;t actually know Japanese), you&#x27;ll notice that sometimes their R/L is more R-like and sometimes it&#x27;s a definite L. There are all kinds of reasons why this might be the case (most obviously regional accent or phonetic context), but it&#x27;s also possible that there&#x27;s just free variation (a la either/either).  I have no idea what&#x27;s the actual reason is.  It isn&#x27;t possible for me, as an English speaker, to process those as the same sound (although prolonged exposure to Japanese might eventually do it; I&#x27;ve become much more comfortable with losing the s/sh distinction as a side effect of exposure to chinese speakers)<p>Finally, your idea that we read word-pictures, and not words, is quite wrong; the best exposition I&#x27;m aware of is at <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition....</a>",1376897779

Actual sight, sound and smell of a horse is just stored to the extend that allows to recognize horses better in the future but it&#x27;s not the part of any reasoning you might have later of why the horse was there, where was it going and whether it would be cool to own a horse. You use abstract representation of a horse for all those thoughts.<p>> Personally, when I imagine a horse, I don&#x27;t imagine some abstraction of a horse. My subconscious minds pieces together chunks of images from my experiences with horse-images and puts together something reasonably close.<p>You feel that but if you tried to draw or sculpt a horse you&#x27;d see how many pieces you thought you recalled you actually made up or have no idea of how they really look. If I&#x27;m not mistaken you admit that the horse you try to imagine gets rebuilt from bits and pieces that are stitched together. In my opinion foundation of that construct is that internal abstract representation of a horse concept.<p>> (i.e. the experience that a silhouette is likely a 3D object that is spinning in a particular direction)<p>In my opinion brain doesn&#x27;t switch between spin right, spin left, but between, this person is slightly above me, this person slightly is below me. Change in the direction of rotation is just what tells you very clearly that your brain just switched. Not only perception of a 3d object changes but the whole scene, relation between observer and the object.",1376897640

For example in shool we used C++ combined with the Intel IPP libraries (which are really fast btw). The first book I bought for a job was C + bits of optimized assembly since it was written specifically for a TI Dsp. I&#x27;ve also played with it in Python but don&#x27;t remember the lib name atm.",1376896166
6236007,comment,6235829,6235829,45,0,rndmize,,,"This doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all. To be blunt, Notch&#x27;s work has continually been very... half-assed.<p>I first felt this when I played Minecraft; with successive patches and new added elements, it always felt as if Notch had had an idea, and gone to implement it, and then never bothered to flesh it out or work out the kinks. The Nether and portal system was pretty sorry at release, with basically nothing to do in the nether; rails and carts were always minimal given the possibilities as well as having various non-obvious mechanics that were somewhat frustrating; and so on. I feel you can really see this with the help of the modding community, where often a poorly implemented idea like villages or what not is decently fleshed out by someone who had a strong interest in it.<p>After Notch stopped working on Minecraft, and even before, there was talk of Scrolls, and the suit with Bethesda; after some time, that sorta fell by the wayside, was eventually handed off to the rest of Mojang, and Notch went to work on 0x10c. And now that, too, has been left in incomplete form.<p>I dunno whether its a matter of expectations, where the massive fan responses he gets damages his creativity, or if he just loses interest in projects (I have no lack of half-completed works laying around myself) but at this point I&#x27;d rather hear about a new project when its close to completion or released, rather than as he develops it.",1376896149

Contrast this with the libertarian-leaning small-c conservative Ron Paul, who often worked in conjunction with left-democrats - but generally not the Democrats (such as Kucinich, Barney Frank), and who is thus NOT a big deal to Democrats.  To a large extent, the fawning over Sullivan is a sort of a political expediency.  Now that the capital D Democrats have seemingly lost Sullivan, I would not be surprised if his big-deal-ness will fade, as he dismissed again as just one of those smarmy libertarians.",1376895930

It&#x27;s always good for teams to include broad-minded generalists that continually survey the landscape, connect the dots, and keep the team&#x27;s reservoir stocked with fresh developments from the outside world.

Increasing wealth concentration = increasing concentration of political power => democracy undermined.  US is excellent example - the populace can vote, but only for candidates preselected by funders in the top 20%; populace can advocate, but top 20% has much better access, influence (due to both campaign funding and 'revolving door' jobs when leaving office), and in some cases actually writes the legislation (bank bailout being a major example).<p>When that happens, you get capture of the government and regulators, financial excess & crisis, and symptoms of banana republic:<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/05/the-quiet-coup/7364/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/05/the-quie...</a><p>2.  <i>'As long as each generation is relatively wealthier than the prior one, I don't care about the spread within that generation.'</i><p>That's held true for decades, but is not guaranteed to continue forever.  Problem of induction: no amount of confirming observations can prove a theory true, while one single refuting observation can disprove it.  Eg, even if all strata of every generation has always been relatively wealthier than the previous generation, that is no guarantee the same thing will continue indefinitely in the future.<p>Highly concentrated wealth also skews some economic statistics, masking the plight of the lower and middle class.  The latter can even be in decline while the top 20% are making out like bandits by outsourcing chunks of our wealth-creating 'making things' industries to higher-profit-margin manufacturing centers, and that wouldn't show up on some stats based on averages.<p>The workers get laid off while the CEOs, boards, 'pay consultants', and shareholders pocket the increased profits.   And when the top 20% controls 85% of the wealth, guess who those shareholders are.  Bottom 80% is increasingly locked out of the wealth that can be generated from ownership, and forced to subsist as wage slaves.<p>There are arguments that is what is beginning to happen now.<p>3.  <i>'This continual improvement in wealth amongst my own family is proof enough that the very rich aren't impinging on what really matters, which is improving living standards for the majority of people.'</i><p>Your standard for 'proof' is pretty low.

I'll let the amateur historians here argue over causality, but it's really not a road we want to go down.<p>For anyone who believes in the adaptive, corrective power of free markets and democratic government, increasingly extreme wealth concentration should be a concern, since it can and does undermine exactly that.<p>PS - I'm not implying wealth redistribution is the solution, since that's just a poor kluge that addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying problem/s.  But I do think the reasons for this accelerated wealth concentration need to be clearly understood, and in some cases neutralized - unpunished financial fraud that led to the crisis, CEO pay based on board & pay consultant connections,  free trade with countries that allow effective slave labor, among others.",1294305660

It might be possible to do some sort of interception and JIT-style translation for certain parts of code but it might also be possible to provide a DLL level compatibility layer as fallback. That way when DLL functions are called they're called natively, and the main module executes via JIT.<p>I'm not suggesting that would be easy, it'll be balls to the wall hard, but that's the only thing I that immediately springs to mind that wouldn't come with a massive performance penalty.<p>The fragmentation argument is valid and an excellent point to make, however we don't really know who this is being targeted at or the defined primary use cases at this point. If Microsoft can f<i>ck up the user experience so badly with Vista and Windows 7 Starter, they can f</i>ck up the user experience with ARM and not worry too much. It might also be worth bearing in mind that if a recompile is needed, it's going to be in the next Visual Studio, which will support a lot more managed code features through the CLR than unmanaged code on x86_64 (by which I mean the CLR supports more languages and has fairly tight integration - if you use C++ in Visual Studio you're probably using less of Visual Studio overall than if you're writing ASPX in C#).",1294304955

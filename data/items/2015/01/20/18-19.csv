Ever since the Soviet Union collapsed, they&#x27;ve been a weapon without a plausible mission.<p>This has two pernicious effects. First, it leads the people in the silos to think to themselves: if none of this really matters, why <i>not</i> cheat? It&#x27;s all theater anyway, right? Why put your career prospects at risk over something that&#x27;s pure theater?<p>And second, it means that the best and the brightest Air Force servicemembers, the ones who want to wear stars on their shoulders someday, don&#x27;t want to serve in the silos to begin with. Promotions in the military flow from service in real wars, not imaginary ones.

For context, see the summary of the amendment on p. 324, under &quot;ACTION ITEM—Rule 41 (venue for approval of warrant for certain remote electronic searches)&quot;.<p>The goal of this amendment (appears to me, a non-laywer) to be to allow judges to issue warrants for crimes that occur in their jurisdiction, for materials that may not be in their jurisdiction, when the location of the materials has been obfuscated with an anonymizing technology. I don&#x27;t think this is an &quot;automatic warrant&quot; - they still have to establish probable cause, etc.<p>A more interesting sentence from p. 325 discusses the mechanism by which the search may be carried out: &quot;The proposal speaks to two increasingly common situations affected by the territorial restriction, each involving remote access searches, in which the government seeks to obtain access to electronic information or an electronic storage device by sending surveillance software over the Internet.&quot;",1421780351

8918705,comment,8917045,8917045,0,0,putzdown,,,"Stuhlinger&#x27;s letter expresses a basic optimism toward science that was characteristic of the modern era in general and the middle of the 20th century in particular, and which has tarnished a great deal since then. Their faith held that science has a sort of generalized power to produce good; more specifically, that given a relatively small cost investment (in terms of money, time, effort, attention, education, etc.) in scientific endeavor, a very large and concrete benefit is likely to eventually result. His story of the lens grinder captures that expectation.<p>Without arguing the case, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that a much smaller proportion of the people in Western societies (at least) now hold this faith as strongly. The costs of modern &quot;progress&quot; have become more apparent over time: cures often harbor severe side effects; machines have their wastes and their dangers; knowledge that seems sure at first often proves less sure with further study. Our confidence that the costs of science are as low as we once thought they were has weakened; our confidence that the benefits are as great or as inevitable has also declined.<p>His argument that reapportioning money from science to humanitarian causes is not as simple, in a democratic, bureaucratic country, as it seems it should be is still as strong as it was when he gave it, if not more so.<p>But the underlying assumption that, &quot;If we just do something ambitiously scientific, vastly great goods for humanity will result,&quot; is harder to sell than it was. We no longer accept that a manned voyage to Mars (for example) will result in concrete benefits for humanity in a way that is remotely analogous to the support of a lens grinder at the dawn of optics.<p>Proponents of space exploration must continue to both show the rest of us the concrete benefits of investment and, at the same time, limit their expectations. It will never again be like it was in the 60s and early 70s.",1421780156

The prestige of beating the Evil Empire, the serious worry that falling behind would render the US defenceless and undoubtedly juicy contracts for the regular suppliers to the military all played major parts.

In these examples two exist, labeled, S1 and S2.&quot;<p>&quot;Eigenspaces show where there is &#x27;stability&#x27; from repeated applications of the eigenvector.

That line is an eigenspace.<p>At first I though this statement-of-fact meant that the whole tweakable quadrant of the X/Y plot (at a minimum) is an unbroken 2D Eigenspace, because every point within it can be &quot;covered&quot; by a dashed line (a 2D &quot;vector&quot;) if I pick the appropriate start-point.<p>However, the last sentence also says eigenspaces are (despite the &quot;space&quot; in their name) lines, which throws the earlier interpretation into doubt.<p>> As you can see below, eigenspaces attract this sequence<p>S1 and S2 were displayed earlier, but not explained, now this section implies that those lines are the Eigenspaces?

If you are really &quot;into&quot; society (a yuppie, basically) then you might think that living in the big city, decorating your room just right & going out to see an indie film after work means you&#x27;re inspired & hitting creative peaks (Brooklyn is filled with people living vicariously like this). The creative geniuses of previous generations would die of laughter, given that most of them truly devoted their lives to excellence in a given field in ways that were basically pathological.<p>There are rare counter-cases but I appreciate you (peterwwillis) pointing out that many of these examples are a complete crock. &quot;Did you know ______ was a banker when he/she wrote his/her first symphony?&quot; This can mean that ______ was either extremely well-adjusted and working in off hours, or was extremely irate and doing it in spite of his/her job. The anecdote alone has an implied simultaneity that is usually grossly distorted to serve as a success story to inspire continued enslavement of bright, delusional minds.<p>It&#x27;s not that I believe EVERYTHING in the world is a corporate conspiracy, but basically you know whether or not you have a shit job that is destroying your creative mojo, and a few flaky anecdotes cant change that... time theft, maybe. :) But even that is tough, since many companies shun remote work (&quot;oh no the developers might complete tasks efficiently & then enjoy a sandwich instead of <i>working</i>&quot;). They wouldnt keep you strapped in the (mental) electroshock chair if they didn&#x27;t want to come by & press the button.",1421780031

Start sending signals primer signals to stars. For signal S[x], temporal difference between S[x] and S[x+1] would a set amount shorter than temporal distance between S[x-1] and S[x]. Primer signals are short and cheap, transmitting entire Wikipedia should take way longer (Weeks, months, maybe years?).<p>3.

I would, however, like to clarify a couple of things in your two blog posts today:<p>1. &quot;we are the most popular third party image on the Docker Registry&quot;.  This is true based on the # of stars, but that can be misleading when you look at the actual number of pulls.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, phusion/baseimage is popular with about 230k pulls, but if you look around there are dozens of images with millions of downloads, so your claims are a bit misleading.<p>2. phusion/baseimage inherits from the official ubuntu:14.04 image.  It adds a lot of things, and starts a number of services by default, so it is absolutely a &quot;fat&quot; VM-like container.  I&#x27;m not against this at all, but I will point out that the Dockerfile Best Practices article (<a href=""http://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/</a>) is explicit that a container should kick off one process.  If you look at how the highly curated official repositories function, none of them run more than one process or utilize a supervisor.  Docker gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, but calling phusion/baseimage a &quot;correct&quot; way to do Docker conflicts with the official documentation.  I totally get that phusion/baseimage has been around for a long time, and provides solutions to some common problems which may make adoption easier for some with legacy apps, but I would refrain from claiming that your solutions &quot;gets everything right&quot;.  By all means, use whatever works, just be aware that the best practices are clearly outlined on docs.docker.com, not the Phusion blog.",1421778624

There were definitely several questions here I couldn&#x27;t answer, but I definitely feel as if I <i>should</i> be able to answer them if I were going to work exclusively on the front-end (I&#x27;m primarily a back-end developer and have been for most of my career).<p>I don&#x27;t see anything here that seems absurdly trivia-esque.

Again, I couldn&#x27;t answer all of them myself as I rarely work in JavaScript, but they all seem like things that one <i>should</i> know if one is working exclusively in JavaScript.",1421778362

I&#x27;m really excited to announce this first release of Kronos Notebook, which is just IPython [0] packaged as a Mac app totally independent of any external environment. It comes with its own Python interpreter and package database, so the installation should consist literally only downloading the zip file, unzipping it into /Applications (or anywhere else you want to put it), and double clicking on it to run it.<p>If you&#x27;d like to see some of the cool things it can do, I recommend typing in the examples on the website (apologies – for now they&#x27;re images...). In particular, the last example on the website demonstrating interactive widgets is my favorite :)<p>It includes a number of built-in packages and is capable of installing (through a dialog) many others – should work on most PyPi packages, though not ones that require linking to C libraries that aren&#x27;t installed. You can export created notebooks to HTML and do all the other nice stuff IPython usually lets you.<p>This was created along the way to Kronos Haskell [1], which is my IHaskell IPython kernel [2] packaged together with GHC and Cabal by building on top of ghc-dot-app [3]. I took this as an opportunity to experiment with delivering a final, product ready Mac app,  including the website, pricing, billing, etc. As a result, I&#x27;d love to have any feedback you have on anything, whether it&#x27;s the application itself, the pricing, the website, or anything else. Happy to answer questions about anything, of course.<p>As an aside, note that there are some other alternatives to this, such as [4]. I think that Kronos is a bit more polished and self-contained – I really tried to go from &quot;proof of concept&quot; stage to &quot;finalized application&quot; stage. Those alternatives, however, were definitely a source of inspiration in coming to do this (though not in any code or structure or anything), so I think they&#x27;re worth mentioning.<p>If you have any issues, please let me know.

His enthusiasm for the subject was evident.  The aspect about the class I liked best, and which I try to emulate, it that he rarely ever directly answered a question.  He would, with incredible patience, ask you questions in-turn to help lead you to the solution or definition.

The fact that you are going to concentrate on one of them (and it's not THIS project) leads me to believe it likely has minimal value.<p>Barring better info in your question, I would say either:<p>1) Just open-source it and be done with it<p>2) Auction it off and donate the funds to something like the EFF (you might get more attraction this way and get a higher price.

It is not only not rational (cannot be expressed as the ratio or integers (although 355/113 is close and you can get as close as you like by using bigger numbers)) but it is also not the root of any polynomial with integer coefficients (rationals being a special case).<p>The digits of pi cannot become periodic.<p>None of the above is enough to show that every finite number occurs ""eventually"".

Could, for instance, the Congress decide that whatever bills the president proposes would have the full effect of law without a follow-up vote?<p>I think the answer is no, but I'm not completely sure. Congress has ceded a heckuva lot of authority already to the executive branch in terms of regulatory authority. If the answer is no, then where is the line and who the heck would adjudicate? The Supreme Court? The Court has been <i>extremely</i> hesitant to go anywhere near the legislature, and for good reason, but if a majority party were to cede all voting rights for the body, I'm thinking somebody somewhere would have to call them on it. I guess that means the Supremes <i>do</i> have something of a role in the legislature.<p>It's also interesting that something has to go wrong, or there has to be a big political firestorm, and then suddenly everybody is a constitutional scholar.

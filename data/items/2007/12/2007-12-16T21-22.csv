I reference the illusory ""let us fund education with lottery money"" mentality many states follow forcing universities and colleges to seek funding elsewhere.<p>Case in point, Truman State University, the university formerly known as Northeast Missouri State University.  Several years ago this institution embarked on a re-branding excercise to become a self-proclaimed ""little Harvard"" in order to survive.  From a financial and quality of education standpoint it has been a successful exercise. ""Truman State University's quest to become the nation's leading public liberal arts university"" is a demonstrable success regarding national ranking and all the metrics that go along with that ranking.  It is serving the nation well as an institution of higher learning.  I don't know if the same can be said for Missouri's citizens, especially those of northeast Missouri, whose children are no longer admitted.<p>I predict that education at public universities will follow the path that their affiliated extracurricular sports programs have followed as they compete for corporate largess.  Their will be a ""Top 20"" group of winners and everyone else.  Unfortunately, the Top 20 cannot educate all the students in need of an education.",1197839779

Harvard hasn't <i>lost</i> all that much (maybe 25% if the $8B number holds up).  But as a result of the recent aggressive investments, huge chunks of its endowment is in illiquid assets that can't themselves be used to fund the university.

You program by assembling visual blocks that are either control structures, instruction top modify properties of objects, event triggers etc. It is good because it greatly reduces the part of learning to program where you find the syntax errors in your code. It is also a lot of fun because the result of your program is visual, animated and interactive.<p>I introduced it to my nieces a few month ago. I installed it, opened it and told them they could use it to create games, I didn't teach or showed them anything about it.

There's two ways to approach this.<p>1) you use extra, or the new aggregate framework (that I haven't tested out)\n2) you keep track of a comment_count in your Entry model and probably create a post_save callback on your Comment model.<p>The tags on the other hand are much more difficult, and I haven't figured out a great way to handle this except for saving a pre-rendered version of an entry, or saving a cached version of the tags as JSON (in addition to actually relating them) in the Entry instance.

The listed systems are very disparate, but here's a couple of examples:<p>In Redis you can read or write ~100k operations a second. You can do set operations, add, rem, member, list .. way cool if you can stomach the memory use. Lazy sync to disk. Hard to think of anything that could beat it for collecting stats or totals etc for high volume data streams.<p>In CouchDB you can do M/R style indexed views, like word counts. You can access the DB directly from HTTP, no special drivers - the DB is implemented as a web server. You can authorise via OAuth (soon), secure via TLS and proxy through squid. You can access, and replicate, from the other side of the world.<p>Tokyo Cabinet is over 10 times faster than MySQL as a simple hashtable, like, say, a session store, which is the first place most sites start having trouble with their DB. Tiny, bare bones, drivers for all major languages, network accessible. A no-brainer for simple storage IMO.<p>And all of these are completely free, unlike the cripplingly expensive commercial alternatives you mentioned - especially important for startups.<p>So .. basically I completely disagree, there's a lot of good things about these alternative DBs. Don't discount them just because you heard a few dumb ill-informed comments on sites like this, most people involved in non-RDBMS DB implementations know exactly what they're doing.",1248269898

717804,comment,717555,717727,0,0,Ardit20,,,"I suppose the operative word there is significant and strong. I did not imply that you need genius level intelligence to be creative, what I implied is that not everyone can be creative as the article states and I gave my reasoning which is that seeing as most people, those of the normal IQ of 100, see the world in the same way, then their writing, designing, whatever skill is abundant and ""normal"". When however you move slightly up to the 115 level, you are just that little more different in at least one variable therefore your work is slightly less abundant hence a bit more creative. You may say that whoever has an above average IQ can and is creative, that is mainly due to intelligence because they do see the world differently from the 100 IQ guy, but to say that anyone can be creative, needs a redefinition of creativity.<p>I have not heard of one person with an IQ of 100 who has made some known creative work, or any person with the IQ of 100 who has become a prime minister, a lawyer, a doctor, or whatever else which demands creativity.<p>You see, one fallacy that this article makes, and those who suggest that intelligence is dead, is that they ignore the whole picture. Take two people who want to be lawyers, doctors, designers, psychologists, writers, painters, one of them has the IQ of 100, the other of 115. They work ten years to get to their desired position, at the end a panel of judges will decide which to take, who do you think will they pick?<p>The guy with the IQ of 100 might be considered superior to some other guy with the same IQ, yet even here this might not be so as the other guy might be superior in something else hence they really are equal. Not to mention that the guy with the IQ of 100 will have much more competition and there will be plenty like him chasing the same goal, hence the abundance of the work of that quality.<p>Yet the guy with the IQ of 115 is clearly superior as he probably has a better working memory, a better thinking capability to motivate himself, more insight, he probably reads widely to stimulate himself, is interested in things for their own sake, and also compared to the previous guy he has less competition and there are less people of his kind chasing what he is, hence less of his quality level work, so statistically he has more chance of making a creative work which is recognised of course and contributes significantly to the world.<p>I would be surprised if Picaso does not have an above average IQ. His work is highly creative and it does take some brain power to come up with something totally knew as one needs not only to understand how the old works, but to also transform this knowledge into something new.",1248269462

717800,comment,717713,717713,0,0,mdasen,,,"This actually highlights a small problem with the Django ORM: outer joins.  select_related() is great when you want to follow a foreign key, but it doesn't work on reverse foreign keys or many to many relationships.<p>So, if you have a blogging app with entries and comments, you can't do Entry.objects.select_related('comment_set').  However, it does work the other way (Comment.objects.select_related('entry')). Basically, the issue is that when you're doing multiple multi-value lookups, making them into objects becomes difficult because of the rows that SQL returns.  Let's say that you were trying to look up both the comments and tags at the same time.  You'd get:<p><pre><code>  Entry--Comment--Tag\n  1      sam      blue\n  1      sam      red\n  1      sam      green\n  1      mat      blue\n  1      mat      red\n  1      mat      green\n  1      jon      blue\n  1      jon      red\n  1      jon      green\n  2      adam     fun\n  2      adam     party\n</code></pre>\nTurning that into an object isn't trivial because you don't have the comment from ""sam"" three times.  It's only there once, but appears in the results set three times because you get join1rows * join2rows in terms of the number of rows returned.  And that's an example of two reverse foreign keys with minimal related data.  The issue is that it would be easy to shoot one's self in the foot with even more joins.<p>Rails used to do outer joins and then choke (go really slow) if you did something really complex.  It now uses an IN() query when you hit the first accessor.<p>I'd still like to see Django support this case as it's a decently common thing to want to do with an application.  At the very least, select_related() should raise an error when you try to specify a reverse foreign key that it won't follow.  Many people think it follows reverse foreign keys because it gives no indication that it doesn't unless you look at the queries that it's running.",1248269357

My team is now embarking on an even larger project, and we have implemented the pattern described in Ryan's talk - and it is fantastic in terms of flexibility.  We're very confident that we'll be able to tackle whatever ambitious requirements come up.<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBe...</a><p>I've made myself watch this talk about 12 times, and each time I keep pulling out some essential bit of wisdom.   Now, there's a lot of stuff in there that might be obvious to someone who uses other languages/frameworks for making GUI applications.   The HandlerManager eventBus that he's using is really the same thing as NSNotificationCenter, for example.<p>But for someone coming from a web or JEE background, this presentation was pure gold.<p>The second way in which I was using GWT wrong in my first project was I was compiling my app each time rather than staying in hosted mode.  The reason for this, however, was because we didn't understand the value of hosted mode early enough in the project...and so programmers committed changes  that  made hosted mode stop working (through missing configuration that made hosted mode need to connect to an app server in order to debug).   Had  I known a bit of Ray Ryan's wisdom, I would have written a single RPC call following the command pattern and mocked up a dummy service for use in GUI development.<p>Another minor thing was that we were using Netbeans rather than Eclipse.   While I love Netbeans, and hate Eclipse, the GWT team has made Eclipse a well-worn path and it's really slick.  The GWT4NB plugin gives one the impression that they need to go through an agonizingly long build process every time they make a change.   Turns out, this was not true.",1248267958

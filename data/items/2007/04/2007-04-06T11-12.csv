9558,comment,9243,9301,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"I agree with Readmore that you can still find that kind of feedback from other people you know.<p>Perhaps another big benefit of having a co-founder is the mutual moral support you can give each other.  Sure, you can hire a designer to make your logo, but it's pretty unlikely you'll be able to hire someone to cheer you on night and day.  It would be even weirder to hire someone to celebrate your victories with, and have that person understand first-hand what each triumph means.",1175860126
9557,comment,9361,9361,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"The only reason I can imagine applying to YC and then not going through with the startup if I didn't get in is if when I applied I wasn't totally sure that I and my cofounder were totally on crack when we thought we could start a startup. Acceptance by YC would, in that situation, give a big confidence boost, and validate the idea. I don't think that's a terribly unreasonable premise. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some currently successful startups who thought they might not do it if they didn't get into YC. ",1175859686

If you think the shiny surface of your product can be that much of an after-thought (i.e. not considered alongside the functionality you choose to code), you either have wonderfully abstracted code (or lots of useless code) (in which case you're delaying it because you can), or you have a different definition of Artist than I do (in which case you're delaying it because you've confused design with gloss).

I guess if they were going to be completely fair all proceeds should go to charity, or back to the government or something...",1175857675

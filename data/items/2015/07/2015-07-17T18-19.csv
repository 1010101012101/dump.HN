9904553,comment,9902790,9902790,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"As a physicist for the last 20 years, I suppose I am to partly to blame... ;)<p>I would say that it depends on what you call physics.  The areas of physics that were symbolic of advancement in the previous 20 years will not necessarily be the same areas where advances will be in the next 20 years.  During the 1800s, advances in physics in the first half of the century lead to technological advances in steam power and electricity in the second half.  If you thought of physics as meaning electromagnetism and thermodynamics, you might think that there were few advances in physics in the first half of the 20th century.  And there were people that felt that way!  But I think that nowadays we would think that Einstein&#x27;s heyday was an era of major physics advances. So, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t look at those areas that are reaching the plateau of their sigmoid curve, but newer areas.<p>Classic particle physics, exemplified by the likes of Chadwick and Lawrence way back in the 1930s, leading to the explosion of the particle zoo in the 1950s, and then the diminishing returns of the LHC era, would be a good example of sigmoid curve development in Physics.  If physics only means this stuff to you, then yes, it is going slower than it was.<p>Areas of physics that have been closer to the high slope region of their development in the last 20 years:<p>Quantum Information Theory (as noted by @abdullahkhalids)<p>Dark Matter/Energy/whatevertheheckitis<p>Medical Physics (from lead block linacs and xrays to IMRT/VMAT & modern imaging)<p>Materials Science/&#x27;Condensed Matter&#x27; physics<p>Black Hole science, esp. thermodynamics<p>Gravity waves, or the lack thereof (interesting either way)<p>techniques for signal/data processing and analysis (such as superresolution or single detector imaging)<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more that I&#x27;m not aware of.  Anything that is really very new is too small to get much press right now.  Pretty much by definition, the new small stuff won&#x27;t have the big press budget of CERN or NASA.",1437159574

Illustrating what the parser is doing with clear examples would be very helpful.<p>Reading it again, I think the &quot;sticky&quot; parts begin with discussion of the grammar.

If `promise` is a Bluebird promise that will be a no-op, and if it&#x27;s a foreign promise or thennable you&#x27;ll get a new Bluebird promise that will resolve/reject when the foreign one does.

9904493,comment,9904156,9904156,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"The less FDA the better to my eyes. The incentives are broken, and the FDA is greatly slowing progress at a time when the potential to create new medicine is greater than ever before. Regulation is reason why we don&#x27;t have the first fruits of the biotechnology revolution in the clinic today.<p>The much-touted ballpark estimate of a billion dollars to produce a modern pharmaceutical from start to finish is about a decade old now - that figure is adjusted for today&#x27;s diminished dollar value, eroded by inflation. You can replace &quot;pharmaceutical&quot; with any medical technology that is going to require a fair amount of original research and further tinkering in the laboratory to obtain the first working prototypes and the result is much the same. This large round number is the kitchen sink cost across a decade of work, including failed attempts and the opportunity cost of investment. The lion&#x27;s share of the direct expenditures are imposed by regulatory requirements: trials, data, and more trials.<p>It has long been my position that almost all of the work carried out in the US at the behest of the FDA to prove safety is unnecessary. In fact it is counter-productive, as the immense imposed costs on development shut out a great deal of the experimentation and small-scale initiatives needed for rapid progress. Much of what the FDA demands is not demanded by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world, and even their requirements are very onerous in comparison to the standards in place fifty years past, a time when medical development seems to me to have worked just fine. It is a question of balances and choice: it is better to err in favor of faster progress and informed patient choice, but that is very far from the present state of affairs.<p>The result of an excessive and growing regulatory burden is that many potential medical technologies languish, are rejected outright, or are never developed at all, and patients suffer as a result. Our future health is determined by the pace of progress, and a slowdown across the board harms all of us considerably. Unfortunately that cost is invisible to the public at large and thus bureaucrats suffer very little as a result of the harms they cause by blocking progress. Meanwhile even comparatively small harms caused by an approved treatment that turns out to be overwhelmingly beneficial save for some negative effects for some people can snowball in the media to cause great damage to a career in the FDA bureaucracy. So you can see that the incentives are very much aligned with ever greater demands for proof and ever greater costs imposed on medical research and development. This is in fact what has happened over the past few decades, with the present result that in an age of radical progress and plummeting costs in the laboratory it is nonetheless the case that medicine is ever more expensive and the introduction of new applications of medical research has slowed down. This is well known and widely commented on, but so entrenched that this detrimental trend shows no signs of slowing.<p>So, to return to the cost of developing a modern pharmaceutical product: estimated at a billion dollars (in today&#x27;s dollars) ten years ago, the same approach results in an estimated $2.5 to $2.8 billion dollars now. Interestingly the bulk of that is apparently not due to the increased time required to run the regulatory gauntlet, but rather largely due to other increases in the demands of regulators: much larger trials and more data.<p><a href=""http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014...</a><p><a href=""http://lifescivc.com/2014/11/a-billion-here-a-billion-there-the-cost-of-making-a-drug-revisited/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifescivc.com/2014/11/a-billion-here-a-billion-there-...</a><p>There is great frustration with this state of affairs, and it manifests with the creation of organizations such as Faster Cures and Tomorrow&#x27;s Cures Today, none of which seem to be making much difference, sadly. The lobbying makes some people richer, and nothing changes as a result. In the end the only thing that is going to work is regulatory arbitrage - that the development goes to other parts of the world, and therapies are available there until the FDA is shamed into approving them because the people in charge look like clowns if they don&#x27;t. This is exactly what happened for stem cell therapies; those available in the US today would still be held up in interminable trials and requests for more data without the fact that they have been widely available in overseas clinics for years. The pattern of activity in the FDA has nothing to do with safety and efficacy and everything to do with job security for bureaucrats.",1437158839

9904446,comment,9903730,9903730,0,0,nexus9,,,"Truth is most academic philosophy is irredeemable garbage of the first order. Philosophy was transmitted from the Greek to the Latin, from the Germanic to the French, and presumably it was also extended to the English. There is in fact a clear line of descent in terms of the reasoning and discoveries made which can be traced from the Pre-Socratics to the critical romantic enlightenment strains of Kantian and Post-Hegelian philosophy, ending ultimately in a series of complex distortions wrought by the Marxist school.<p>After the second World War, however, a rupture occurred in the English language tradition that broke ties with this movement. This is why we have a &quot;Continental&quot; / &quot;Analytic&quot; divide. The former attempted to stay consistent with the philosophy passed down to the Germans and French, whereas the latter severed most of its relations to these systems of thought. It did this by largely cherry-picking the parts it liked from the Renaissance scientific thinkers along with certain Irish and British figures like Hobbes, Locke, and Mill but without ever confronting the Germanic philosophy at the peak of its development (the only notable exception being British idealism, which was shortly replaced by the logical positivists). Although it later made some amends with Kantianism, what the analytic tradition has ended up with is a one-sided formal empirical philosophy grounded more in ideological posturing than the rational discourses that characterized all preceding philosophy.<p>What people call British-American philosophy today then is dangerously out of step with itself. It&#x27;s retracing the same errors that were worked out centuries earlier by their predecessors. There are countless examples of this, which I simply don&#x27;t have the patience to enumerate. That&#x27;s not to say the Continentals are without blame. They&#x27;ve created their own share of mistakes. But that, in effect, is a very large part of the answer about why philosophy is mostly irrelevant today in North-America. It was lead down a blind alley by ideologues and has yet to recover.",1437158394

But larger brains can be easier to work with, such as for slicing studies where you examine the different areas of the brain to look for evidence of changes that you might want to keep for the next generation. Smaller brains have less matter to work with, and therefore have less of a chance of developing novel features that strike your fancy while you attempt to select the ones that might have a higher probability of developing impressive cognitive ability. Having said this, I am very interested in trying to take something already rather clever (like a dog) and seeing how small we can get the brain before it loses all of its interesting behavior.

When this happens, the customer benefits more from coordinating their schedule with the individual cleaner than from the on-demand scheduling via Homejoy.<p>For Homejoy, saying &quot;we are bonded and insured&quot; reduces reluctance for a first you or when on-demand service is the primary consideration.

This would definitely give you a good overall growth in many areas.<p>If you want to develop skill-sets in a particular domain, then I would suggest to go join a big corp where you can learn some best practices, get mentors and maybe even find interesting folks for you own startup at some point later in life. 
Also a somewhat middle path can be achieved by joining an early stage startup where you can find the above mentioned things in the team, and the pace of growth will be faster as well.<p>Will share my personal experience as well, maybe it might help. (Though take it with a pinch of salt, as it&#x27;s not purely objective for me anymore.)
I had a good chance to do a startup right out of college with a few friends and some ready funding/accelerators acceptances, but I took the option to go with a big corp. After about an year, I really regretted that decision. I have been wishing to go back and change that... So I left the big corp job after about 2 years, and have been working in core founding team of a startup for 2 years. Learning pace is much quicker in startup, but be clear in what you want out of the time you give to the organisation you will work for be it your own or someone else&#x27;s.<p>Big points of regret for me: 
1. I had a good team with me then (damn difficult to find this), 
2. I was quite passionate about the problem we were working on (again not as easy to develop as it sounds).
3. Seed funding was readily available, so finances would also have been taken care of while working there (as you grow this starts becoming a concern as your burn rate increases...)<p>Also, I would suggest you to watch both Paul Graham&#x27;s lecture (L3) and Dustin Moskovitz&#x27;s advice (L1) @ <a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupclass.samaltman.com/</a> to also maybe get some more perspectives.<p>Hope it helps.

Startups are more fun. Like the other commenters said, in just 1 year you will learn quite a lot more in a startup than you would in an enterprise company.<p>2. If you are joining an Enterprise, you are mostly working on code that is already built by someone else - you have to adapt to that - adjust to that. This is not in itself a bad thing - but my belief is that when you do things from scratch - you learn a lot more. As a freshman - out of college - your main aim should be learning - not money.<p>3. Startups have the advantage of being a possible rocketship. You never know. If you happen to get on one - you will be set for life. You dont have any remote possibility of doing that in an already established company.<p>4. I am overly generalizing here - but in a larger company - you will have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and politics. Its an unavoidable thing when more than a few humans come together. This is detrimental to your growth. It wont allow you to move fast and break things.. which is something you should constantly do as a freshman.<p>5. Again generalizing, startups are more tech focused ( assuming you are a techie ) and enterprises are more management focused. If you join a startup that is a rocketship, you will most likely learn both tech and management at the same time. If the startup you joined dies, go join another one.",1437157240

When this first happened, oil wasn&#x27;t that valuable and I believe the usual term was a flat fee per barrel extracted.  The agreement was reach before Iran had any form of democratic government.  As oil became more valuable in the period before, during, and after WWII, most governments who signed these deals renegotiated these deals once they realized how valuable the oil is.  I believe they wanted to be paid based on market price per barrel.<p>&quot;Legal basis&quot; is a funny term to use when you&#x27;re dealing with national governments.  In truth, there is very little legal foundation for resolving these dispute until recently and even now it&#x27;s pretty shaky.  I mean, who&#x27;s legal system do you use?  It would seem since all this is happening in Iran, it should be Iranian laws.  If that&#x27;s the case, then the nationalization attempt was legal.<p>What actually happens, however, is that national governments get involved and other forms of leverage is used.  I once talked to a lawyer for a major oil company involved with a dispute with Venezuela.  The State Department was involved to some extend but at the end of the day, their leverage was their ability to extract the oil.  So &quot;legal basis&quot; is usually not something involved in these sorts of disputes because usually the country with the oil has the upper hand in that case.",1437156584

I do not know the details. I would be interested to know on what occasions if any they&#x27;ve actually done this. I&#x27;ve certainly never heard, e.g., of anyone being recompensed because the government has introduced a new tax on the sale of an asset they hold a lot of -- but that might be quite a different situation because it doesn&#x27;t exactly involve new laws.)<p>The judge, to be clear, didn&#x27;t find that there <i>is</i> substantial harm. Only that the government hadn&#x27;t adequately established that there <i>isn&#x27;t</i>. This was a purely procedural matter.<p>The music industry made a bunch of other claims, on which the judge found in favour of the government. For instance, when assessing the harm done to copyright holders, the government essentially asked the question: would they actually sell fewer copies with a limited-private-use exemption in law than without? The music industry contended that instead &quot;harm&quot; should be measured by assuming that every copy taken is a sale lost. Unsurprisingly, the judge agreed with the government on this.<p>So it seems at least possible that the government may go away, lick its wounds, come up with a bigger pile of better evidence that a law of this kind will not in fact make any substantial difference to the music industry&#x27;s profits, and then pass pretty much the exact same law again. I do hope so.<p>Or they might come up with a smaller easier-to-marshal body of evidence that the harm is <i>really rather small</i>, and pass a similar law that does compensate the music industry just a little.<p>I fear that actually they&#x27;ll just drop the issue, though, and leave us with a stupid restriction that most of the population ignores and that no one is realistically going to be able to use to prosecute anyone anyhow.",1437156412

9904201,comment,9902244,9903282,0,0,solidangle,,,"AFAIK Industrial Light and Magic used Arnold for a lot of movies, Framestore used Arnold for Gravity (I&#x27;m not sure what they use now), Double Negative uses a whole range of renderers (with layer between their OSL shaders and the renderers) and Weta uses their own in-house renderer Manuka now. Most studios switched away from Renderman as its support for ray tracing was extremely lacking until a year ago. On your list of points:<p>* Bidirectional path tracing and VCM, surely is nice, but you&#x27;re absolutely fine with just path tracing. Artists have learned how do to avoid SDS paths and how to optimize their scenes for path tracing. It would require a lot of time to train artists to optimize their scenes for VCM and with the amount of diffuse noise (which is unavoidable) I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s worth it.<p>* I doubt the subsurface scattering in Cycles is slower than Renderman as it only supports bicubic and gaussian profiles which are even easier to evaluate and sample than the approximate BSSRDF ;). Their profiles are extremely lacking (and I doubt it&#x27;s enough these days), but SPI used bicubics and gaussians a few years ago [1].<p>* I absolutely can&#x27;t imagine that Cycles doesn&#x27;t have Environment Map sampling, which is something pretty basic and explained in PBRT. Sure, Cycles probably doesn&#x27;t have an implementation of &quot;Portal-Masked Environment Map Sampling&quot; by Bitterli, Novak and Jarosz yet, so I&#x27;m sure Renderman is better at it, but Cycles is decent at it.<p>* Same for arbitrary geometry lights, but I&#x27;m sure Renderman does a better job at it (although Pixar is probably limited by Solid Angle&#x27;s patents on importance sampling quads and other stuff, Cycles doesn&#x27;t have to deal with patents).<p>* AFAIK Cycles has a state of the art hair shader, but it seems to lack the importance sampling scheme by Eugene d&#x27;Eon.<p>I absolutely agree with you that Renderman is a more complete and faster renderer, but Cycles is absolutely amazing if you keep in mind that it was completely developed by a small team of hobbyists. Cycles isn&#x27;t meant for production rendering, but it&#x27;s amazing for hobbyists.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2504520"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2504520</a>",1437156401

If you want to make a successful startup, your unit of sale better be super profitable.<p>Most successful technology companies sell bits, with high fixed costs but very small marginal costs.  This means if you grow really big, your fixed cost growth will eventually flatten out but your profit can continue to grow.  Facebook, Google, AirBnb, Uber.<p>If you are selling something in the real world, especially if you are owning the whole process, then your marginal costs are going to be pretty high, which means your profit margin is going to be lower.  This is completely fine and a ton of businesses run like this, but these businesses have to be very careful with their fixed costs.  You can&#x27;t grow like your average tech startup because this model is different than most tech startups.<p>The exact reason they are going out of business is less important than the fact that a business with high marginal costs is very fragile.  A slight increase in a high marginal cost can destroy your profit margin, whereas if your marginal cost is extremely low then you are much more resilient.<p>High fixed costs + low marginal cost = Good<p>High fixed costs + high marginal cost = Be careful",1437156393

9904169,comment,9903831,9903831,0,0,jasonwilk,,,"I wanted HomeJoy to work and tried to use the service a few times. What the failure came down to:<p>1. The cleaners were not professionals. It felt like they were just recruiting anyone who wanted a job. You could really feel this with the lack of passion from the cleaners and the severe lack of quality cleaning. Most of the people complained and were quite rude sometimes. Cleaning is very much a skill as much as it is manual labor.<p>2. People don&#x27;t want to let just anyone into their home to clean. Especially for those that have valuables, you want someone you trust who is going to hopefully be your maid for years to come. I wouldn&#x27;t want someone new every time and for that reason, I used HomeJoy only at our office but even that wasn&#x27;t enough due to poor quality.<p>Someone on this thread further explained this well, which is that HomeJoy is at a high level, a match making service. Once you find a match, why do you need HomeJoy? Connect directly with the maid and have them come on your own schedule for a fraction of the price.<p>I used to feel the same way about Uber. If I found a good driver back in the day I would get his phone # and take him exclusively to the airport. Uber solved this with UberX and by having a wealth of seemingly skilled drivers that made it a true on demand service. Having to book an appointment like HomeJoy seems like it is not a true OnDemand service, just a nicer UI than any other maid connecting service.<p>AirBnB I feel had a similar problem. For frequent business travelers, finding the right place at the right price is awesome and I would usually try to stay at the same place and connect with people directly. AirBnB solved this with overwhelming demand for the service (the place I like may not always be available) and with their insurance policy and scheduling tools for renters.<p>In any event, I don&#x27;t feel like HomeJoy failing is indiciative of a bubble in the On Demand economy. There were inherent principles of this business that made it destined to fail that others in the space won&#x27;t have a problem with.",1437156225

I have so many operators who have to come to clean our space and have done a messy job. The difference between good and bad operators is very stark - and it is the good ones you want to deal with.<p>With driving, nothing of that is required. Many people are in auto mode when they are driving. Think about it - is it easier to drive vs. cleaning your place? Of course you want basic driving skills to be there - but I think the DMV licensing process and Uber ratings generally takes care of that.

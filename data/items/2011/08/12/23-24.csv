2879699,comment,2879464,2879684,10,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, it's actually a fairly old (but still interesting) observation that very large corporations are a form of top-down central planning. In fact many old-school communists first got inspired by late-19th-century capitalism's trend towards managed technocracy. There was a large movement in business that argued that production could be scientifically optimized using statistics, data collection, scientific management, etc. The communists just took it to its logical conclusion and asked, why not organize all of society in the optimal manner, using principles of technocratic scientific management? Even <i>that</i> argument was more or less originated by capitalists; some of the large industrial trusts argued that there was no problem with monopolies, because they were simply the most efficient, scientifically managed form of industrial production, unlike the messy, inefficient web of competing small businesses they had replaced. So really the only thing they disagreed on was how the profits of the centrally managed monopoly should be distributed.<p>There's an odd amount of borrowing in the other direction, too. Many large businesses <i>do</i> realize that they internally are basically inefficient, bureaucratic command economies, mirroring some of the problems with the Soviet system. So they introduce some of the same attempted solutions that the Soviets tried: intra-corporation pseudo-markets, competition and awards, recently the trend of ""gamifying"" workplaces, etc. (At the risk of self-promotion, I recently wrote a bit on the latter similarity: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/soviet_gamification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/soviet_gamification.html</a>)",1313192188

Also see another post on this thread saying that generally in the book the proofs are poorly written.<p>""For those skimming the book, or perhaps more commonly, keeping it as a reference, it's a great compendium of algorithms references, much like a slightly more rigorous, paper version of Wikipedia.""  I can believe that, but it doesn't conflict with what I wrote.  Indeed, I found and downloaded a PDF of the book for just the purpose you mentioned and that I mentioned in my first sentence:  The book likely has some core computer science stuff, that is, not just poorly done, hijacked applied math that apparently I know much better than the authors, that I may be able to use as I finish the software for my server farm.<p>Gads, it looks like they want to use the approximation approach of starting with a minimum spanning tree to solve the traveling salesman problem in the plane.  The idea also works in any Euclidean R^n.  It's a CUTE idea.  I first saw it in a paper of Karp who easily has some nice proofs of some astounding properties.  Sadly in the book I saw some references for the idea but not from Karp, and I didn't see mention of some of the really nice properties.  There's a chance of a biggie point there:  For all the teeth grinding over NP-complete, that problem is NP-complete but surprisingly easy to solve with surprisingly good accuracy; so, the suggestion is that there is a crack in the armor of the NP-complete difficulty.  That suggestion is actually more important than the problem itself which in practice people are not struggling with.  Yes, the traveling salesman problem remains important, say, for production scheduling, but there the problem is not on a Euclidean R^n.<p>Some computer science is nice and useful.  Hopefully there has been some such since I put down Knuth's TACP!  So, maybe in some issues of handling deadlocks, transactions, race conditions, reliability via parallelism, and more, there will be something useful in the book it would take me more than 90 seconds to reinvent!<p>Still I'm correct:  They should clean up their act in their math.

2879642,comment,2877563,2879362,4,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Learning 'math' as a good ugrad or grad student is NOT easy and involves a special step often called 'mathematical maturity' where the student learns to be good at reading and writing definitions, theorems, and proofs in math.  This step is NOT easy to learn and in practice is nearly impossible to learn without some careful teaching.  The usual place to learn the step is in a very precise course, with a lot of very well graded homework, in abstract algebra and then to strengthen the learning via very precise courses in advanced calculus and, maybe, point set topology or measure theory.  Without that step, nearly no one knows how to do well writing definitions, theorems, and proofs in math.<p>Mostly fields outside math try hard to teach math within their fields.  Examples of such fields include physics, chemistry, economics, psychology, sociology, electronic engineering, and, yes, computer science, In all cases, the results are at best poor.  Of course, those fields are helped by the fact that the math departments don't want to do well teaching service courses, say, in second order stationary stochastic processes for signal processing in electronic engineering with the fast Fourier transform!<p>But you noticed the problem:  The CS profs make a mess out of math.<p>For the book of this thread from MIT, that fact is a bit surprising:  For one, among the authors, at least Rivest has done some good math.  For another, for each math topic in that book, MIT has some high expertise.  E.g., in optimization, Bertsekas is there and long there have been others.<p>Once the basic ugrad lessons in math are learned, one still has to learn how to communicate in less severe forms.  So, the book failed there, too:  Their algebra for the core steps of the simplex algorithm was too long.  And, their intuitive explanation, as I objected to here, really was not correct.  Sadly they just wrote their chapter on the simplex algorithm too quickly from too little study.  This is especially sad since there are many highly polished presentations of the simplex algorithm.<p>They got pushed into attention to linear programming, and the simplex algorithm, because of some important connections with some problems, e.g., flows on networks that they want to regard as part of computer science, where linear programming is a very important tool.<p>So, really, it's a strain to call 'flows on networks' computer science.  Instead, it's a topic in applied math, back to Ford and Fulkerson, yes, with some by Dantzig, but more from Cunningham and Bertsekas, in particular, part of operations research.  So, CS wants to hijack flows on networks.  Not really good.<p>I omitted a more serious objection to the book:  It makes a mess, a really bad mess, out of probability.  Yes, in the study of the performance of algorithms, probability is important.  So, once again, CS wants to borrow and use or just hijack some applied math and makes a mess.  That at MIT they make such a big mess out of probability is something of a surprise.  Still, in the US, the good courses in probability require both measure theory and functional analysis and are rare, even in math departments.  Sad situation.<p>In using probability for performance of algorithms, in TACP Knuth did better:  He stayed with a more elementary approach to probability and made it powerful enough.<p>E.g., in the book, I saw where they mentioned that the need for probability was that the data had a 'distribution'.  Mostly that's not what have to pay attention to:  E.g., don't much care about Gaussian, uniform, exponential, etc.  Instead, what care about most of all is independence and, then, sometimes, lack of ties.  Sad situation.<p>For both teaching and research, CS needs to clean up its act in math.<p>Still better, math should just open up, welcome, take in, and take over all the more important fields that are heavily math -- physics, economics, social science, electronic engineering, computing, operations research, etc.  Instead of being one of the smallest departments on campus, teaching a few service courses, and otherwise struggling, math could be one of the biggest departments on campus, awash in both funding and students, and one of the most important pillars of growth in our economy.<p>I have an example:  Some years ago I took a problem in practical computing and derived some new probabilistic math for a solution.  Right, I used measure theory.  I wrote prototype software, ran it on some real data, etc., and wrote a paper.  So that I could get the paper in front of people in computing, where the applications are, I looked for journals in computer science.  From one editor in chief of one of the best journals, a chaired prof of computer science at one of the best research universities, I got back ""Neither I nor anyone on my board of editors has the prerequisites to review your paper."".  Later I got almost the same statement from a second such person.  For a third such person, at MIT, I wrote custom tutorials for two weeks before they gave up.  But in the end the editor in chief of a good Elsevier journal seems to have walked the paper around campus and gotten feedback enough to get the paper reviewed -- the editor couldn't review it!<p>The paper was a nice contribution to computer science.  Generally nice contributions will want some math.  For all concerned, CS needs to learn some math.<p>Here's what they need to do:  After calculus, get a good book on abstract algebra, pay full attention to the proofs, and learn some 'mathematical maturity'.  Then get a good, first book on linear algebra and learn some important material, still paying attention to the proofs, and get more maturity.  Then get Halmos, 'Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces' and learn from one of the best writers of math ever and get an introduction to Hilbert space theory.  Then go carefully through Rudin's 'Principles'.  Then do some more in ordinary differential equations where get to use both Rudin and Halmos.  Then do some optimization -- e.g., pick from linear programming and some of Bertsekas.  Then learn some measure theory, functional analysis, and probability based on measure theory.  Cover basic stochastic processes, e.g., Markov, Gaussian, and martingales.  Then learn some mathematical statistics.  THEN return to computer science.",1313191005

Are you aware that most introductory algorithms courses (i.e., the ones this book is targeted at) don't end up touching linear programming? Why? Because there are tens of other algorithms that are more useful for a typical CS person at that level. For those skimming the book, or perhaps more commonly, keeping it as a reference, it's a great compendium of algorithms references, much like a slightly more rigorous, paper version of Wikipedia.",1313190633

The program structure should reflect the problem structure as closely as possible<p>2. Thinking of every possible case (""enumeratively"") is much less powerful than abstract reasoning<p>To me the second point is where the power of functional programming lies. You express ideas in relatively small units with no side effects that are easy to fully reason about. When you express things clearly it just feels right. Special casing is possible in most functional languages, but it usually feels like a kludge.<p>Another excellent essay is EWD831, ""Why numbering should start at zero"", which was something I felt was intuitive once I got used to it, but couldn't articulate clearly.

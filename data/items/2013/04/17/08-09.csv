It is a hardware invention, but generally would be implemented in software.<p>Keep in mind that for a patent to be granted the invention must be:<p>1) Non-obvious to someone skilled in the art.\n2) Novel (ie. not done before).<p>Patent attorneys and patent offices seem to only use a test for novelty. They tell me that if an invention is obvious, then somebody would have done it before. They have no specific test for non-obviousness apart from demonstrating prior art. They seemingly have no ability to refuse a patent by just claiming that it is obvious. To them, lack of prior art is evidence of non-obviousness.<p>It is as if they live in another world, where the only inventions and ideas possible are the ones previously patented.<p>I can only assume that this has come about because a test for non-obviousness is subjective. It's easier for an examiner to let it through and lets the courts sort out the mess later, at our expense.<p>It seems to me that this is the root cause of ridiculous patents.

5563386,comment,5561686,5563124,7,0,laumars,,,"I think he's being quite fair as he's acknowledged the hard work behind this game (any modern game written in any language is impressive work), he's just saying that this project is getting a lot of media attention because it's advertised as using certain tools which it actually isn't.<p>If I'm honest, I feel the same way as the aforementioned poster. Writing any modern game in QBasic is akin to A-Team style engineering (building a rocket launcher out of an old shoe and some duct-tape). QB64, however, is basically just like any other modern scripting language. The former would require massive hacking and ""outside the box"" thinking to build even the basics of the game engine; where as the latter is just Python written in the syntax of BASIC.<p>That all said, I can't blame him for misleading people a little (whether that's intentional or just dumb journalists not understanding the distinction between QBasic and QB64) as making a project visible can be as hard as the actual development process. So at least he's hard work will see some reward. Plus he's offered to release the source because of public interest - which is quite honorable.",1366187995

But matching and researching which gesture works with which functionality, to the degrees customers find it natural took effort and time, and it produced a creation that was not obvious before that research.<p>Besides, if this is already part of the current rules, why do we need to amend the rules for it?

For the simple reason that there's a significant chance that this attack, like many others, was done by elements of the government. Or groups with the ability to strongly influence the official investigation.<p>The days when we the people could trust the motives or results of official investigations into politically significant crimes, are long gone.<p>The government develops ever-more powerful technological tools for monitoring ordinary people. It's entirely appropriate for ordinary people to use every technological tool at their disposal to guard against government wrongdoings.<p>If the Internet was able to identify the person(s) responsible here, and prove (for eg) that this was a government ploy to ban the sale of ammunition reloading black powder or bulk cartridge sales, that would be of immense significance.<p>For this reason I applaud the posting and permanent archiving of photos of events where such attacks occurred. We need some way to bypass the controlled MSM's low bandwidth and tendency to publish low-res, selected, edited and generally useless news images.\n4chan doesn't cut it, due to the impermanence problem.<p>Another thing to be wary of, is the 'vanishing 911 photos' syndrome.

I've never needed to know the exact millisecond a key was pressed, the rebound is just fine.<p>Lets be honest here. Programming is not some intensive exercise. Nor should you be getting carpal tunnel as a programmer- if you are, you need to dial back the boilerplate.<p>I don't enjoy laptop keyboards if only because they force my palms to be raised- I have large hands, so for me it's natural to rest the bottom of my palms on the desk or even on the side of the desk, whereas on a laptop it's at an equal height to the keys- which is annoying as hell. I also dislike the shape of too many laptop keyboards, if only because they seem to prioritize style over feel and key differentiation(lookin' at you, Apple).<p>But this isn't intense stuff. If you're gaming, or doing high-speed data entry, or even if you're a prolific writer, you may have a real claim. But as a programmer, claiming that you need a mechanical keyboard is nonsense. They're nice, and if you want nice tools, that's okay, and I encourage you to invest. But they're not required, and they're never going to make you a better programmer.",1366186752

You own your own image, and are owed compensation for that advertisement. And it is fully within your rights to not accept an agency's offer to compensate you at all, thereby preventing them from legally using the image you have been capture in for commercial purposes.<p>Now, if you are in a picture, but nearly impossible to identify (ie: a crowd shot taken at a baseball game, or a marathon finish) then the image can probably be used without your permission and without compensation.<p>Newsworthy events, of which this clearly qualifies, also change the rules.

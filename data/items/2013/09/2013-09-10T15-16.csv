Relighting is easy assuming he&#x27;s using standard deferred rendering techniques. Zooming can be clamped to a certain range.  If the voxels are rendered off-screen at maximum zoom, that just leaves panning the render around on the screen. In other words, he can render each tile once and cache them as 2D images to reuse in later frames.  Each frame he only needs to render new tiles that have not been seen before.  Unless you are panning really fast, that&#x27;s a small amount of work compared to re-rendering the whole screen every frame like most 3D engines do.",1378828648

Meaningful equity to me is enough that if it hits, you at least have enough money to spend a few years doing what you want.  My main point is, there are some startups worth joining.

6360791,comment,6359092,6360066,3,0,lambda,,,"Birthday attacks can work against content-based addressing schemes too. Sure, they may be a little bit harder (you need to convince someone to merge something that is able to carry a large random payload), but given that, say, the Linux kernel has a bunch of binary blob firmwares, it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard for a hardware manufacturer to submit a driver for new hardware with one firmware, and then replace it with another later on.<p>For a similar example, you may think that generating a CA signing certificate would involve a second preimage attack, as you would need to generate a certificate that had a hash that matched one of an existing CA. But it turns out that you only need a birthday attack, because you just need to submit a certificate for signing that is one of two that collide, where the second one is marked as being a CA cert. This has actually been done a with certificate authority that used MD5 for signing certificates.[1]<p>There are lots of file formats that allow you to fairly easily create MD5 collisions, by virtue of being able to stick a random string that won&#x27;t be interpreted somewhere in them.[2] If it were feasible to produce such a collision using SHA-1, anyone who got such a file merged in Git could then substitute it for an evil file and no one would be the wiser.<p>That said, this attack does require the ability to generate a collision on SHA-1 (which has not yet been done), the ability to convince Linus (or a subsystem maintainer) to pull your tree containing a big binary blob, and that binary blob being able to do something harmful when substituted that it couldn&#x27;t do just by virtue of being a difficult to audit binary blob (otherwise, why bother with the birthday attack when you could just subvert the blob anyhow).<p>It&#x27;s true that the writeup should distinguish between these cases, and contrast their difficulty, but you shouldn&#x27;t be quite so quick to handwave away the possibility of collision attacks rather than second-preimage attacks.<p>If I were to build a content-addressed storage system or design Git today, I&#x27;d probably use a SHA-2 or SHA-3 hash to be on the safe side. While no one has yet demonstrated a SHA-1 collision publicly, it&#x27;s been substantially weakened; it just doesn&#x27;t give a good enough security margin. Current estimate are that finding a collisions would cost about $2.7M in cloud computing time[3], and there are lots of adversaries who have well more than those kinds of resources.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/</a>

I&#x27;m probably going to want to tweak the parameters.<p>2. The calculation is going to be difficult to express as a succinct equation.<p>3. I may want to look back over the result later.<p>Using an ordinary calculator is cumbersome because of 1 and 2, and doesn&#x27;t satisfy 3. AN alternative is to use an ordinary interactive shell to put everything together, which helps with 2, but still makes for a lot of work on 1 and doesn&#x27;t fix 3.<p>Writing a whole program to do the calculation is an improvement because it fixes 1 and 2, and it helps with 3 because I can leave myself lots of comments. I&#x27;ve found literate CoffeeScript to be very effective here (you can even turn it into a nice webpage to share your math with others), but there are still some drawbacks. The results are not interleaved with the code, so when I look back over it, it&#x27;s not easy to check my work and debug. The workflow also leaves a bit to be desired. You can&#x27;t, for example, quickly play with a small snippet as you&#x27;re working through your thoughts.<p>A notebook, on the other hand, elegantly handles all of these considerations.  I can use markdown to create a nice article for my future self explaining all of my calculations, have comments, code, and results all next to each other, and tweak parameters on the fly.<p>Yet I still find myself using literate CoffeeScript instead. And the main reason for that is that whenever I use Python, I constantly wish that I was using CoffeeScript instead.",1378828396

My guess is that he was actually less worried about her because she was actually doing well in the class and I imagine many of the students weren&#x27;t. Sure, it is a real bummer that she was turned off of the programming industry because of her classmates, but if he had devoted most of his non-teaching time to just her, imagine the struggling students in the class who might have wanted to learn but couldn&#x27;t get any of the teacher&#x27;s time or help? Odds are they would be demoralized and unlikely to continue programming as well.

Yet...when given a very basic collegiate task, they won&#x27;t do it to a mere 60% sufficiency.<p>There&#x27;s a fundamental difference between high school and college: the latter is not obligated to pass you. Every opportunity is given, every task may be simplified to near-triviality, but if the student won&#x27;t take the steps on their own, they reap the consequences of willful inaction.<p>But, of course, you refuse this experiential insight and insist it&#x27;s all about malicious greed.",1378828215

Your second point on the other hand, that has some meat to it. I&#x27;ve said several times in the past now that the low representation of women in tech is the fault of the media and our school systems, and to a very small extent this article demonstrates that.<p>To begin with the state of tech education in public schools is absolutely abysmal, it takes a dedicated student with a strong interest in tech to tough it out through the school system, rather than being encouraged to go into tech by the school system. The media portrays programmers and other tech industry professionals as a bunch of lonely anti-social misfits who are almost exclusively male and either so exceeding stereotypically nerdy as to practically qualify as autistic, or else overweight and lecherous. These two factors combined mean that the vast majority of students, both male and female, decide to avoid the tech industry at an early age because either they believe the media stereotypes or else they take some tech related classes and are so appalled at the curriculum that they practically run to other professions.<p>When considering a career in the tech industry, going solely by the state of pre-college and entry level college tech courses, combined with the overwhelming media stereotypes around the tech industry, is it any surprise most women decide to pursue other fields?",1378828018

If a user gets used to one of them (say, proximity), how smoothly can you keep them educated that if they are in the subway, GPS won&#x27;t work, so they need to try /method X/, then /method Y/, etc. That may be worth the effort to some services where security is absolutely paramount; hopefully anyone using this service builds in some heavy analytics to find out!<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.mailchimp.com/social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mailchimp.com/social-login-buttons-arent-worth-i...</a>",1378826961

Of course many vulnerabilities are the result of unexpected interactions between modules, but then a certain composition of certain modules could be audited and hopefully not require any changes for some time.<p>Being a software engineer I&#x27;m not kidding myself with regards to the huge software engineering problems inherent in achieving that, and of course the open source community already performs a lot of code reuse.

Very fair price (If you think that is expensive, then you clearly do not work in commercial GIS, where licensing of software and data is insanely expensive). At the same time, they force you to use the data on a Google Map component (yes, even for the paid accounts), and while their api is acceptable, their js map control is severely lacking in features compared to something like leaflet, openlayers, or esri&#x27;s js component. This may have very well been simply an arbitrary decision, but it has the effect of snuffing out any small companies or start ups that want to use their apis to build new, innovative applications. Considering the big few companies in this space bought up just about all the data companies that originally compiled the underlying data, this seems completely anti-competitive to me. I am not saying they should give it away for free, but there should definitely be some smaller paid plans with more open terms of use, considering that Google and the couple other competitors basically just purchased a cartel together over the last decade.",1378825887

When I was bullied in high school my car was vandalized, I had to take time off from exams because my face was a wreck and I was being monitored for brain injuries. I skipped class because I didn&#x27;t want to hear, &quot;fag,&quot; for the thousandth time. I didn&#x27;t want to <i>deal</i> with the food being thrown at me in the cafeteria or the snickers as a I walked past the gossiping kids in class. I&#x27;ve never had to deal with being discriminated against because of my gender but I cannot imagine that it hurts any less.<p>I was lucky. A friend of mine was beaten into a coma. The bullies showed up to his benefit concert to throw pennies and harass the attendees. He has been living the rest of his life with the effects of severe neurological trauma. Yeah, kids are mean.<p>It has been more than a decade since I escaped that hell-hole. I&#x27;ve since read articles about other unlucky kids who&#x27;ve died being stabbed to death by a mob. I&#x27;ve read about girls who have committed suicide because they couldn&#x27;t deal with the slut shaming. Sure these cases are beyond the norm but I wonder if they are not indicators that things are just getting worse for kids these days.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. We can single people out who make sexist jokes and correct them, loudly and publicly, and try to help them understand that they&#x27;re not funny, clever, or cool. I agree with the author that teachers can be a part of the solution. But I don&#x27;t think that is the final word (and it never is when trying to change prevailing attitudes and norms): parents need to tell their kids to stick up for people who are being bullied, that it&#x27;s not funny, and that it&#x27;s dangerous to not say anything when they hear someone spout off something hateful.",1378825731

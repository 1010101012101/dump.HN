9204876,comment,9204497,9204497,0,0,nkurz,,,"This is a fine series of articles done over several months.  The final one includes links to the rest: <a href=""https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/thats-not-normalthe-performance-of-odd-floats/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/thats-not-norma...</a><p>This last one was also the one that (in retrospect) I found most important:  when optimizing floating point routines, do not underestimate the performance penalty of denormal math.  You&#x27;ve probably realized that NaN can hurt performance, but denormals can be much more insidious.  Not only can each one cost a few hundred extra cycles for the operation, it also resets the branch prediction buffer, so that the next couple executions of every if statement and loop elsewhere in the program suffers an extra 15 cycle penalty!<p>But it gets worse!  Like a disease that quickly kills the host, NaN has the saving grace that it usually only happens once, since it generally contaminates the result.  But adding or subtracting denormals (numbers larger than zero but less than FLT_MIN) can go on, and on, while your performance slows to a crawl. And unless you know to be on the lookout for floating point exceptions, simple profiling can hide the source of the problem in the noise of all the missed branch predictions.<p>Making it even trickier, different compilers have different defaults.   Intel&#x27;s compilers default to FTZ (flush-to-zero), but GCC (and I think Clang?) keeps it turned on.  So if you test with ICC but distribute source code, the first sign of a problem might be an end user who experiences code that runs 1000x slower than it does on your test system, but only on certain inputs!<p>Here&#x27;s another couple articles on this (IMO underreported) issue:<p><a href=""https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/x87-and-sse-floating-point-assists-in-ia-32-flush-to-zero-ftz-and-denormals-are-zero-daz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/x87-and-sse-floati...</a><p><a href=""http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/cuda-pro-tip-flush-denormals-confidence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/cuda-pro-tip-flush...</a>",1426381034

And they&#x27;re mostly the same reasons why we have to rely on free market to  distribute the majority of wealth: the centralization and power issue, the inefficient issue, identity issue when your worth is tied to the minimum work you need to do (granted this is already a problem nowadays). And to determine a minimum fair share of work means to determine the minimum total work that a society needs to do, which is equivalent to determine the minimum amount of wealth to be produced. Ask 10 people and you will have 20 different answers on what is the &quot;minimum living standard should be&quot;.<p>Also, it stops (or drastically slow down) society from technological progressing.

I dislike LessWrong and self-described rationalists, including Yudkowsky as far as I know him. I agree with su3su2u1 that, insofar as Yudkowsky intended HPMOR as a pedagogical vehicle, it was not really well done.<p>That said, it is rare that a work of fanfiction manages to be a legitimate deviation and self-contained work that both comments and reflects upon its originator usefully. Generally speaking, I prefer to give all fiction the benefit of the doubt: whatever its failures, it is hard to ignore that it was successfully <i>written</i> and as someone who has tried my hand at it, I know firsthand the challenge overcome. There&#x27;s a &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; quote insertion that belongs here. I <i>did</i> find it to be a good and engaging story, though, if painfully in need of an editor, which is not a unique remark in the land of fanfiction.<p>If you want to <i>really</i> have fun, compare HPMOR with the Left Behind series, which qualifies as fanfiction as much as anything. There are probably some fascinating parallels to be found with their relationship to their original works and author intentions and the like.

In fact, he echoes your thoughts about how models replace one another:<p><pre><code>  First, the new candidate must seem to resolve some outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in no other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a relatively large part of the concrete problem solving activity that has accrued to science through its predecessors.\n</code></pre>\nHe doesn&#x27;t deny that there is such a thing as scientific progress, he only means to model scientific progress as an episodic cycle in which existing paradigms present with insoluble problems, and that these problems are only resolved when the old paradigm is replaced.<p>It wasn&#x27;t so long ago that Einstein declared that God doesn&#x27;t play dice with the universe. Kuhn doesn&#x27;t deny the existence of scientific facts or the utility of the scientific method -- he only hopes to illustrate that the notion of scientific truth is contingent on certain assumptions and that these assumptions often get in the way of future progress.<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember that Kuhn wrote &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; back in 1962. At that time, he was largely responding to the logical positivists. While I think a lot of the contemporary rationalist movement is caught up in old logical positivist modes of thought, your own willingness to invalidate models based on evidence wasn&#x27;t fully developed before Kuhn and Popper brought such thinking into the mainstream.",1426379085

The implementation is not the specification; but the <i>type is the specification</i>. Like people like to say, the type is a Theorem, and the implementation is is the Proof of the Theorem. (In a very real sense.) And don&#x27;t you need both?<p>Hopefully there can be some type inference at a certain scope, to avoid cluttering the code with a lot of &#x27;obvious&#x27; type declarations. I forget exactly how dependently typed languages work in that regard right now (there certainly can&#x27;t be full type inference).<p>> All the compiler does is checking that these two specifications are consistent with each other.<p>&quot;All&quot;. That&#x27;s already better than informal mathematical proofs.<p>>  Your types can have bugs too, in which case nothing will help you.<p>Yes, just like any other kind of alternative specification there is. Short of mind reading, there is no getting around actually describing <i>what we want</i>. But where there is a distinction to be made is in what kind of specification is easy and declarative enough to use as to give the least likelihood of introducing bugs in the spec itself.<p>> What frustrates me about detailed type systems is that as detail increases, difficulty of writing the types will increase and type bugs will become more common.<p>I guess if we assume that we have collapsed/unified the type and term(/value) level, we can use any old Good Software Engineering Practice when it comes to keeping the types tidy. Like using type functions to encapsulate some of the detail: maybe have a `sorted(list)` function instead of having to write it out each time we need it.<p>This is just a guess though; I don&#x27;t know how the dependent programmers do it. Well most of what I&#x27;m writing here is <i>guessing</i>, on some level.<p>(And judging by the pride that some people show when they proclaim that &quot;half of our code base consists of just tests&quot;, well... I certainly think that types can be more succinct than that!)<p>> Now, assuming the bugs in your code and types are statistically independent that would still save you a lot of bugs, but I suspect they are not.<p>I guess if we go with the previous assumptions of a unified value/term level, then the statistical chances are the same in that types are just ordinary values, instead of the types belonging to its own language. ;) Then we just have to make sure that the amount of types is substantially smaller than the amount of &quot;regular ol&#x27; code&quot;.<p>Typer er fremtiden.

9204752,comment,9178765,9203473,0,0,xxgreg,,,"I think your argument is clear - but I think you&#x27;re also missing a point about another approach to evolving JS, and how development stacks such as Dart can fit into this.<p>Bignums - ok - you claim that bignums could have made it into ES6 if google had provided more support. I&#x27;ll take your word for it, but you can probably understand my scepticism.<p>I&#x27;m not religious about language either. I don&#x27;t care much about syntax. What I really care about is being productive.<p>IMHO the main things that help my productivity are:<p>* optional types<p>* completion<p>* doc popups<p>* development-time runtime type checking<p>* good debugger<p>* Few implicit conversions<p>* Consistent core library<p>Now you argue that google would have been better off building these language features and tooling on top of ECMAScript instead of creating the Dart stack. What would this alternative scenario actually look like - especially from the point of view of a developer?<p>* It could be a mode in V8, or a fork of V8 (I&#x27;ll call it &quot;V8FutureMode&quot;). V8FutureMode would be incompatible with other vendors JS VMs. Just as Dart is.<p>* Each time ES standardises a new feature already in implemented in V8FutureMode, then all your existing code would need to be updated to match the ES spec. This regular churn is painful for developers.<p>Now let&#x27;s consider another scenario where google develops Dart, and ES20 arrives in 2020 with optional typing.<p>* 2013-2020. Stable language no breaking changes.<p>* In 2020 I can port my code over to ES20 (trivial as near 1:1 semantics, 99% automated).<p>This scenario is better for me as a developer. It also insulates me from the risk that optional types don&#x27;t make it into ES until 2030. I also think it gives a lot of real world usage data helpful for getting optional types into ES. (You seem to disagree here.)<p>From the Dart team&#x27;s perspective the Dart scenario is better too:<p>* Can build a core library and tools on a stable language, rather than having to regularly deal with breaking changes.<p>* Able to experiment with VM optimisations which are difficult to do in JS due to legacy compat.<p>* Personal motivation - this is what the developers really want to work on. (Being told by your boss to drop your experimental project, and continue doing the same old thing isn&#x27;t always a good management approach)<p>I&#x27;m optimistic that over time experiments such as &quot;use strong&quot; will mean that the same optimisations implemented in the Dart VM will be able to be used in other JS VM&#x27;s. Perhaps if a developer guarantees that all JS code is &quot;use strong ES20&quot;, then it would be possible for a browser to even use a different VM behind the scenes (in Chrome perhaps even using the original Dart VM codebase, but with the language front-end changed to compatible with ES20).<p>The future is uncertain and difficult to predict. There are multiple ways to evolve JS - you seem quite certain that incrementally fixing JS is the only approach. I think building a new programming stack, and simultaneously evolving JS in that direction with insights learnt from the new stack, is also a valid approach.

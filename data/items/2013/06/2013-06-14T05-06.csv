  the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in

Surely they understood a business need (which I later found referred to in a two-year old news article) that I was not aware of before.  Yet, x million valuation for it?!<p>To make it worse, the founder says that he&#x27;ll hire about fifteen-twenty folks and that by itself will raise valuation to a few tens of millions.  Someone else also told me that the people who are involved in due diligence for a company&#x27;s valuation are often merely comparing it to previous startup exits in the same space and at the current size of the company (plus of course largely made up projections).<p>Looks like there are not so commonly known rules of thumb used for valuation that are being exploited by those who know.",1371187048

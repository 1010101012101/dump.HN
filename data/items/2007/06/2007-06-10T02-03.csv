27106,comment,27063,27063,0,0,erdos2,,,"It's typical of commercial enterprises (and some academics) to write about technology without citing references  and prior work--perhaps plagiarism is more profitable than citation. <p>(Richard Fateman's old review of Mathematica documents this tendency in the case of Mathematica. I could give examples in academia.)<p>For those interested in the literature on continuation-based web servers, here's a paper by Shiram Krishnamurthy and others.

They probably migrated to Linux in just the same way, OHMIGODC001 C0MM4ND-L1N3!<p>I think it's just a project so they can feel like they're working hard on something. It's a time-killer. A wasted effort unfortunately :(<p>(I hope I didn't come off as too harsh...I've only gotten 2 hours of sleep in the last 24 hours and have a bit of a sun burn)",1181442031

And I'm not sure that he justified his assumption that inequality is necessarily an evil.  this isn't about exactly the same thing, i admit, but doesn't paul graham have an essay about inequality in a society being a good thing, a sign of a healthy economy, or something like that?  <p>oh, and i could picture the audience shifting uncomfortably at his jokes about trying to score chicks at radcliffe.",1181441854

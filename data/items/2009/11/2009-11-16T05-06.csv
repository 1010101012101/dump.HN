944012,comment,943947,943947,0,0,simonista,,,"Wow, I had never noticed that shadow thumb until this article pointed it out. I had to go back play with it. A couple other random observations: when you click on one of the arrows the real thumb doesn't snap up to the shadow thumb until you've moved the cursor a certain distance away. Also, scrolling by clicking and dragging the thumb has the lag effect mentioned in the article, but scrolling with two fingers on my trackpad doesn't.<p>I think the other problem that isn't mentioned in the article is that, at least for long waves, loading of content seems to make scrolling jerky and unpredictable.",1258350972

However, twin studies have shown us that despite that, personality characteristics are highly heritable.  This suggests that despite differences in behavior due to context, there are genetic and thus pervasive personality traits that are fairly immutable.",1258350817

An experience that you have to HAVE in person, that cannot be approximated online.<p>A bit of google and wiki later, I read the surreal ending to his life: ""[Klein] suffered a first heart attack whilst watching the film Mondo Cane at the Cannes Film Festival[...] Two more heart attacks followed, the second of

Why the comment about ""mobile devices and netbooks""?  Why Wave?  They could just as well put these scrollbars in Gmail or any other Google product.  It doesn't make sense to me, except if they want people to try it out and work out the kinks before putting it in Chrome OS where 1) the primary target is ""mobile devices and netbooks"" and 2) they can much more easily make that the default scrollbar behavior.",1258349089

It's not like they are really poles - you don't get many total introverts or extroverts, people sit on a continuum. A normally distributed attribute is a lousy way to categorize people.<p>Introverts are people who tend to think before acting (which makes them more shy), and extroverts act before thinking (which makes them less shy), but those aren't the only factors in social adeptness. A polite introvert who can make good jokes will have more friends than the extroverted class bully.<p>The main value of MB is that it's value free.

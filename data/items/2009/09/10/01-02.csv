""I don't need them"" isn't good enough.<p>Is 88MB too much for you to download? Is it too much to store on your hard disk? Is that ""Burn Disk"" button in the bottom right when you're viewing a playlist too distracting? Is the UI hard to navigate now with all these features? Is the ""Share on Facebook"" contextual menu item getting in your way when you're trying to listen to music?<p>All of those things (and more) could be potential arguments against adding those features to iTunes. However, I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of iTunes users would answer ""no"" to every one of those questions. Apple has done a great job of adding features to iTunes without sacrificing much usability at all. If you click the button that hides the Genius bar, then the main screen is still just a list of playlists on the left, and your music library in the main pane. Pretty simple.<p>Thousands of other people use and love those features. People love Macs <i>because</i> they don't need a separate application to burn CDs. Have you forgotten what a refreshing experience it is for a PC user to use a Mac for the first time and realize that it does everything they want out of the box?<p>Presenting users with a set of checkboxes during install is one of the worst things you could possibly do. That's a usability nightmare. It's like setting a trap for your users. How do they know which components they need? How can they be sure it will work if they don't install all the components? What if they choose incorrectly and want to install more components later? Is that possible? The lack of these types of installers is yet another breath of fresh air when you switch to Mac OS X. In most cases you just drag the app into your Applications folder.<p>Apple's applications need to work for ordinary people, not just techies. If you're going to accuse Apple of getting usability wrong, you better be a legitimate <i>expert</i> and have a compelling argument.",1252547948

Not the end of the world for this application, but very undesirable for most things.  You could potentially ""fall back"" \nto MySQL for this but a workable strategy for that probably isn't simple.<p>Further, step two is irrelevant.  There's no way of knowing if a (article_id, friend_id) pair in memcached is from the most recent N days or whether it's been stuffed in due to a user being active.  Therefore, searching the DB for older diggs is still necessary, and should take the exact same amount of load as if they weren't in memcached at all.<p>Memcached + MySQL makes great sense when the data set is small and simple.  If all the content on the site fits within 1 GB you could probably easily push a hundred millions unique visitors a day.  For an application like this, the relatively poor performance of MySQL and the inflexibility of Memcached cause problems.<p>It seems to me that using Cassandra, even in its current immature state, makes much more sense than the solution you're proposing.",1252547584

After all, it's much easier to install these days.<p>Setting up a Hackintosh now is kind of like installing Linux ~8 years ago.  That spare system you have might work (if it's semi recent hardware, in this case), but you might never get the thing to boot.  However, if you buy a system with a Hackintosh in mind, if you read the forums and do the research, you will in all likelihood not have any problems and be able to treat it as if it were a real Mac.<p>>  would say it is much simpler to setup a nice Linux distro and make it look like a Mac...<p>I'm sorry but this is a pet peeve of mine, or at least it touches on one.<p>I ran Linux for ~8 years as my primary desktop.  For most of that time I did not have a Windows machine.  I used GNOME most of the time but also spent a lot of time in KDE and Enlightenment.  I switched to OSX in '06 but I still install Linux every now and then to see where things are, and sometimes I pop by gnome-look or gnome themes sites to see what's going on there.<p>Point being, I have a lot of experience using Linux.<p>That said, you can maybe, <i>maybe</i> get Linux to the point where you can take a screenshot and it would pass as OSX to a casual OSX user.  You can never, ever get Linux to the point where it would fool an OSX user for more than 2-3 seconds.  Pretty much to the point where if they interact with the computer at all they'll know.<p>It's like throwing a camo tent over a tank and saying ""look, the tank is invisible"". It might not show up from 10k feet but anyone that gets near it is going to know it's not OSX, or think it's a very, very broken OSX system.<p>I've seen the blog posts about making GNOME look like OSX and they're insane.  They put some crap ass GTK theme together, throw in cairo dock, tweak crap for 4 hours and say ""look, it's just like OSX but Linux"".  No, it is not.<p>> I feel Linux is on par or somewhere not too far behind.

814394,comment,814161,814248,0,0,netconnect,,,"I agree that simulation is the key to a concious AI system. If or when we ever succeed in simulating a human mind to a close enough degree of comparability, it is almost a given that the system will be self concious.<p>There are some problems simulating the human brain that would also have to be addressed even once we can create a working system, such as the AI being a bit of a blank slate, like a infant or a coma patient.<p>I see the whole process as having to follow a path similar to this:<p>1. A breakthrough in computing power, something capable of simulating very accurately small areas of space, this means perfectly representing ridiculously complicated chemical reactions and some natural laws.<p>2. Succeeding in creating a software environment to execute these simulations within.<p>3. A breakthrough in mapping an existing person, some sort of scan that creates a mathematically provable perfect (or close enough) representation of an area in space. Like some humans mind or possibly their entire body until the subject of the scan can be simplified on the computer. Sort of like taking a photo and then cropping off the body. The above simulation environment may be what is used to provide the simulated inputs and outputs to the head, like the CNS and cardiovascular system. Not to mention the inputs to the eyes and other senses. Sort of like a virtual head in a jar.<p>4. So far we would have a conscious system, but it would be a copy of a pre-existing being. The next step would to be to somehow, ethically, re-write this being. This would provide a learning challenge with the goal of simplifying and modularising the human brain. Such as hacking language areas, input nerves, the reliance on virtual blood and sustenance and most importantly the memory.<p>The final product of this important stage is the most simple and easily tweak-able simulation of the human brain that could be used by all researchers and eventually commercial applications. If all these virtual brains are the same or comparable, this isolates the memory as a way to load in or edit what is essentially... people. The creepiest analogy may be the best, they will be like swappable save game files, executing in virtual machines (the hacked brains) that operate within another virtual machine (dare I say it, a super-simple matrix of sorts)<p>5. We may never reach anywhere near this far along the process due mainly to ethical reasons that cannot be overcome with mere ingenuity. But if we do, the next step is compressing all this down further and further until we have the most simple possible (perhaps provable somehow) implementation of a mind that does not require all the layers of virtualization.<p>God it's easy to get caught up in this stuff.

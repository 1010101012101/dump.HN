What he essentially suggests is that Javascript is becoming powerful enough to eliminate the current need for server side languages.  This, simply, is not the case.",1221177333

Will your product be substantially different from this competitor's product?<p>If yes, you might want to do something else. Like what you said, this competitor has growing traction. It'll be difficult for you to break the momentum especially if you provide nothing different.<p>If you really want to fight with this competitor well, you must offer something different to the users. Eg. tumblr or posterous is like a super-easy lite version of wordpress. That's why they're gaining traction. There are probably XXX number of blogging systems out there that are similar to blogger/wordpress and they just can't break through. Those that broke through differentiate themselves well from these existing services.<p>dropbox is not like the hundred other online storage site. Their interface is brain-dead simple compared to the competition.<p>Will your product be so? That's the question you have to ask yourself.<p>I'm not saying this to be a spoilsport but to help you prevent wasting your precious development time.",1221177110

Then I got bored with the tedium of retyping big strings of characters off a sheet of paper and started just using 1Password for everything.<p>You can use 1Password to create passwords that aren't associated with websites and stuff them into the equivalent of encrypted notes. When I need one I just pull up 1Password using Quicksilver and do a cut-n-paste. It's a little bit tedious, but not as tedious as paper -- and, as you say, I don't do it that often. I use ssh-keychain for most of my logins.<p>If you're freaked out about the probability that 1Password will somehow leak your bank password... don't put your bank \npassword into it. Use paper for that. I avoid allowing my laptop's copy of 1Password to know any password that could be used to harm my finances.<p>If you have a need to log in to registration-required sites on other machines... carry a piece of paper with the passwords you need. 1Password will print things out for you (also good for emergency backup -- stuff a paper log of your passwords in a safe deposit box).<p>1Password also has an iPhone app. I avoid using it because my need for portable, secure passwords is low compared to my fear of losing the phone and having to change all my passwords.<p>Really, you shouldn't type secure passwords into random other machines, anyway, since any of them could be compromised. Keysniffers. Rootkits. If you often log into security-sensitive accounts from strangers' machines... perhaps you should consider getting a laptop, an iPhone, a Nokia, or an EEE?<p>95% of my passwords are of scant interest to anybody, such that the (tiny) risk of allowing a piece of software to remember them for me is nil. I advise getting the software, and letting it go to work on the 95%. If you don't want to trust it with the remaining 5%, don't trust it.",1221174521

If you wanted to (for example) remix ten mono channels to 5.1 surround in real time, the only option was a separate dedicated processor.<p>Since then, CPUs have become massively more capable; any reasonable audio processing can be done on a budget desktop.

2268736,comment,2268476,2268703,0,0,Groxx,,,"Essentially, yes, I do think it does.  The second example lacks a measure of time to <i>complete</i> those units, so they would end up coming to the right - the mock objects are just mocks, the real ones have to be made still.  The ""heavy-handed dependencies"" still exist, because it won't compile without the mocks, and won't run without everything being built.<p>In a Gantt chart, you'd also probably have all those under the same higher-level WBS number[1], so they're conceptually grouped.  Reflecting how they are all related, and are developed at the same time.  Or maybe you'd group the entire project until completion under a single one.  Or something.<p>In any case, you'd have something like:<p><pre><code>  {               1: project scope                         }\n  { 1.1: stub it out  }  {1.2: finish it }  {1.3: deploy it}\n  [build] \\n  [mock]  - [integrate] - [build] - [test] - [deploy]\n  [mock]  /             \ [build] /\n</code></pre>\nwhich is fully within Gantt capabilities.<p>Not that I'm really a fan of Gantt charts.  But most of that has to do with how the UIs have been implemented, which tend to prevent at-a-glance information, because the details are decoupled from the chart.  Useful for managers, not so useful for the ones <i>making</i> those parts.  They're also usually just a spreadsheet with a static chart nearby, which prevents a lot of simple twiddling of details that are difficult in spreadsheet form.<p>But the only difference I see so far is that the mock-objects have a shade on the left which shows they're mock.  Which is something that is possible to do within a Gantt chart, if not something that's implemented frequently enough to make it practical.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure</a>",1298836460

In the second graph, I added an extra week to develop the application logic and the UI. Originally these were scheduled to take 2 weeks, so 1 week is a pretty big chunk of time in comparison!<p>I also call out this fact later, when I list some potential downsides to developing this way: ""The cumulative time for the sequential method is seven developer-weeks, but the parallel method takes ten developer-weeks.""<p>The time to define interfaces and/or contracts should be a wash.

If this rule forced real open devices to come into existence then it would be very interesting.<p>To me a genuinely open device would be one where we can reasonably fork Android and make a real open source variant.  The idea of a much more flexible, user modifiable device (think dynabook) is very appealing to me.<p>This isn't possible now because most devices are locked, and even rooting isn't an end-user operation, so it's impractical for unofficial variants to propagate.  (which for my purposes means that Android may as well not be 'open')<p>Yes, I know there are 'mods', but they don't count because only enthusiasts can deal with them, and they don't work on all devices.  From that point of view iOS is more 'open' because jailbreaks work on all iPhones.",1298836150

But if you are like me, you spend hours on facebook or hulu during finals week or do other self-sabotaging things online when important deadlines loom close.  Thus putting money on the line could help you stay productive.<p>TimeCarrot works by having you specify your procrastination sources (either a website or application). You then make a commitment to limit your procrastination to x hours for any period of time. If you reach your goal, you get your money back.  If not, then either a friend or charity gets it.<p>I had a chance to meet Paul Graham at the last startup school event at Stanford, and chatted with him about TimeCarrot when it was just an idea. I told him I would like to apply to YC with this. He once wrote ""Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction. We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it."" (http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html) He said the idea was interesting but wanted to be convinced that users would stick with it and use it.  Honestly, I don't know if it works beyond the small proportion of friends at Stanford. That's why I am posting it here in hopes that I will get honest feedback from people who don't care about our feelings.

Usability of a desktop application is way more complex than a website[...]</i><p>I think usability is a blend of user experience, usefulness and intuitiveness. I have a hard time associating the latter with either the programmer or the designer.<p>My experience, as a programmer working often with designers, is that many of them (not all) are more concerned with the visual appeal of an interface and to a lesser extent its intuitiveness and usefulness.<p>For example, I've built quite a number of web management systems. Most times, when I team up with some designer they'd want to make pretty icons. However, I've come to the realization that we get more praises when the client can just look at his system and recognizes what he asked us to build and can easily <i>guess</i> where to go next. And that more often happens with text buttons. I believe that visual cues have their place, but I also think that many graphic memes have gone beyond useful, which probably doesn't help the relationship between programmers and designers.<p>On the other hand, I remember a time when I would build some quick ass functionality, but presented in such a convoluted way that only other programmers could understand the prowess and usefulness of the feature. You had to get up up early to get me to change them!<p>Programmers tend to be very minimalist, whereas designers are often very expressive. I think there is an effort to be made on both parts to reach a middle-ground. Designers need to learn that pretty doesn't necessarily mean useful. And programmers need to realize that just because their work is useful doesn't warrant that it's <i>usable</i>.<p>There's hope though. In time I've learned and now strive to make features as intuitive as possible. I now also favor very pretty, text-only, icons.<p><i>[...]and the current trend of ""removing functionalities"" is not always welcomed by developers...</i><p>In my not so humble opinion, graphic interfaces should be designed with the Pareto principle as a guideline (80-20 rule <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle</a>). Is the feature useful? Yes. Will it be used often? No. Lets put it in the ""nice to have"" list.<p>If the application caters to a broad audience with varying levels of expertise and usage, it should present interfaces with varying degrees of complexity. I've seen this applied in real life successfully (e.g. in Ubuntu: dpkg >> apt >> aptitude >> Software Center). I definitely agree with you though, that too many software nowadays try to make things too easy without offering a way to go <i>beyond the basics</i>.",1298834446

Because based on my admittedly anecdotal research, i would say that the latter almost certainly do care. Why none of the developers have stepped forward, i don't know -- maybe they feel like their talents would be wasted given the past administration of the Mac client? Maybe they think it's a hopeless cause? Have the VLC team made it clear what sort of developer they're after? Do they want someone to just expose their functionality changes to the OS X version, or do they want someone to take <i>charge</i> of the OS X version, in the same way that Transmission's Mac UI team take charge of their OS X version?<p>> Editing a NIB and not making it open source, is near useless for the community...<p>Of course it is. But why do you think people do that? If they felt that the work they were doing anyway could influence the design direction of the official VLC project, wouldn't they jump at the idea? Almost certainly they would. They <i>don't</i> because they feel like no-one at VLC <i>cares</i> about their work. (And given that the OS X version is unmaintained, i guess that's true.) They don't know that they have the <i>opportunity</i> to use their talents to make more meaningful contributions to VLC.<p>> Not to mention that the developers don't have to court those people, it should be the other way around... They should propose their design. This goes for everyone, developers, translators, technical writors... Why would designers be different?<p>There is a well-known path for developers to submit their contributions. Everybody knows it, it's understood, it's easily accessible for people who do their sort of work. A designer is less familiar with these processes.<p>Not only that, but a designer can't implement their changes on their own. Any random developer can look up a bug on a tracker and write a self-contained patch that gets merged with the trunk and then boom it's fixed. That's not how interface design works. A random designer can submit mock-ups or image files to a bug tracker, but they require another person -- a developer -- to actually put their ideas into action. This is a much larger barrier to entry.<p>> Finally, about the transcode part, this is not a designing issue, but a usability issue...<p>It is not an aesthetic issue, no. But the work flow -- the steps you need to take to complete an action -- is another aspect of interface design.",1298833504

2268547,comment,2268336,2268336,0,0,kemiller,,,"The whole affair is reminding me of how Ivy League colleges (and Oxbridge) work.  They used to be places where the privileged, moneyed elite could educate themselves in relative privacy, save for a few exceptional commoners allowed in on scholarship.<p>Nowadays, the proportion of talented commoners to moneyed elite is considerably greater than it was even 100 years ago, but the basic principle remains: foster connections among the elites, and give them first crack at any emerging talent.  This way anyone with a potentially destabilizing talent becomes attached to the existing power structure at an impressionable age.  Better to invite them in and dilute the pool a bit than risk them draining it later.<p>Any commoners who don't work out, they will drop without hesitation.<p>I'm not saying this is evil.  If you were among the elite, you'd probably do the same thing.  And I also don't propose that this was all cooked in a room full of cackling conspirators rubbing their hands together.  It's just the way a power structure works.  From their point of view, I'm quite sure they see this as noblesse oblige: they're just reaching out, ""giving back"" and trying to help useful and interesting people succeed.  But it nevertheless has embedded in it the idea that the most important part of success is meeting people who already have power.<p>And as the complainant in the letter writes, it sounds like all the hoi polloi (""Group B"") at TED actually buy into this as well.  Maybe he should be working on something amazing instead of hoping Bill or Steve or Sergey notices him.",1298833321

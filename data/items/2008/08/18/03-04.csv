The re-write really helped people to adjust the signal to noise ratio on Reddit.  I just don't think that too many people have tried it out, yet.<p>My current sub-reddits:<p><pre><code>    * Worldnews\n    * Programming\n    * Business\n    * Geek\n    * Python\n    * Scifi\n    * Cogsci\n    * Politics\n    * Funny\n    * Science\n    * Technology\n    * Linux\n    * Lolcats\n    * Energy\n    * Math\n    * Ruby\n    * Haskell\n\n</code></pre>\nIt gives me a pretty decent mix of Hackerish news with some fun stuff and politics mixed in as well.  The startup news and quality of discussion on this site is still far superior to Reddit, however.",1219031575

You can get a feel for what the voting crowd would like by seeing how they vote.<p>The important question in my mind is, ""<i>Why did you come here and what will make you stay?</i>""  And for me personally, another important question is, ""<i>What is your connection with startups?</i>""  A much more interesting poll I found was this one:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=223846"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=223846</a><p>It established that <i>most of the voting crowd here actually has nothing to do with startups</i> and only one in five of the folks that vote here have founded one.<p>From my perspective that, if the trend continues, endangers my reason for being here (and I suspect the reason that most of of came here in the first place).  If Hacker News moves in the direction of simply being another nerd-news outlet, it'll be a second-rate one.  The opinions I value, honestly, are not that of the majority, but of the interesting minority that are the raison d'Ãªtre of this site.",1219031533

This article matches very closely with our impressions of the political climate of the country and seems consistent with the opinions of the Zimbabweans we talked to -- at least, those who were willing to talk openly about politics.  Certainly there's an economic war going on, but it seems a civil war, where any semblance of a functioning economy has long since been manipulated into uselessness by Mugabe's hand.  I carry my own biases to be sure, but it was hard not to draw this conclusion from what we saw last year and the terrible decline since then.<p>Zimbabwe's current situation is complex, charged, and forged out of decades of conflict among groups inside and outside the country.  I can't argue outright there isn't another broad perspective on what's happening, but I'd like to read about it for myself.  Please post links.",1219031105

278890,comment,278595,278595,0,0,smhinsey,,,"I have thought at times that allowing the definition of constructors in interfaces would go a long way towards solving this problem. It's much easier to manage dependencies with cleaner patterns when you don't have to define some ugly Configure(MyConfiguration) method and throw exceptions if it hasn't been called before you do anything else.<p>In their example an interface doesn't really help since CreditCard is probably a value object, which don't generally provide implementation variations, however you see the problem in the Database and OfflineQueue types, whose lack of an interface is going to add complexity to the test (CreditCardProcessor takes an OfflineQueue but imagine OfflineQueue requires implementors to configure a queue address at runtime, taking IQueue instead would allow you to pass in a mocked IQueue).",1219030419

Therefore, the number of times she's in the state Monday+tails is equal to the number of times she's in the state Tuesday+tails. However, the number of times she's in the state Monday+tails is equal to the number of times she's in the state Monday+heads.

That is, it's good, but not particularly good. It probably wouldn't get many hackers interested in Isaiah Berlin.<p>But if you felt the article was particularly good and would interest more than a few good hackers, I don't see why you shouldn't go ahead and post it. It would be within the HN guidelines to do so.<p>In any case, it's impossible to follow the guidelines precisely, because good hackers aren't all interested in the same things. For any post (especially outside the safety zone of, say, programming, startups, math and physics), there will be some good hackers who aren't interested. But it doesn't follow that others won't like it a lot.

278882,comment,277717,278536,0,0,stcredzero,,,"It's a good general principle.  But I suspect that many people often don't take it as far as it could go.  Memory management is a great example.  It's orthogonal enough to business logic, it can be made to largely disappear from application code.<p>There's a lot more of this that could be accomplished, but our expectations are still a bit too low.<p>One fascinating thing about the Smalltalk environment is how it has managed to make lots of plumbing disappear.  The ""workspace,"" which is an app used for dynamically executing code, is so straightforward to write, a commercial Smalltalk environment (ObjectStudio) had a workspace that was written by a bored developer in an intro class!  (The final version was more polished, but the thing was functioning as a workspace after only 10 minutes of coding.)  Similarly, I can start coding a debugger capable of displaying the equivalent of a core dump in 10 minutes and have something that's usable.  Things that are esoterica in other systems are just ordinary applications.  There's relatively little to a Smalltalk ""IDE"" because there is just less to do to build one.  Most of the meta level is ordinary objects manipulated mostly ordinary programs.",1219029736

The github issues on their public repos seem to be mostly unmaintained (several a month or older without an MS representative).<p>On the flip side, there were some issues with connecting to Azure via the node `mssql/tedious` module, which isn&#x27;t from MS, and a few developers from MS Azure SQL teams stepped up to track down the issue.  Learned a bit more about the TDS protocol than I really wanted to that month.<p>It seems to me that MS Azure&#x27;s development department should either implement a 20-40% time for developers to work on the public stuff and/or documentation as developers desire, or have cowboy teams that do.  MS isn&#x27;t likely to spur more open development efforts as most corporate based projects don&#x27;t inspire much community involvement.<p>That said, given the choice I might be more inclined to use Joyent, DigitalOcean or Linode for my own stuff... The choice wasn&#x27;t mine at work, the existing solutions are mostly .Net (some Node) based and Azure was the most pragmatic choice of migration to a hosted solution when that was done almost two years ago.

9434909,comment,9432479,9432479,0,0,liberalbias,,,"Interesting article, here are some notes from my reading of it.<p>First, in the &quot;The same application with an Eventually Consistent store&quot;, you don&#x27;t actually define the semantics of the system, so there is no way to say how it relates to CAP. Eventually consistent stores, like the original Dynamo, are designed to be AP systems, which is why they have things like read-repair. As long as you don&#x27;t have k failures (i.e., all replicas are down or partitioned), you can always read from a replica, but you may not get consistent data. You can argue here that k-safety is not the same as the A in CAP, but that isn&#x27;t the generally taken approach (and, if true, it means there&#x27;s no such thing as an A system, of course, since you can always postulate that ALL networking in the world has simultaneously been cut).<p>Second, your argument about two-phase commit is combining two different arguments. First, the standard 2PC algorithm does not allow for heuristic commits. That algorithm is a CP algorithm (it is, in fact, referred to as the &quot;unavailable protocol&quot; due to it&#x27;s inability to make progress in any failure conditions). If you add in heuristic commits, then it becomes a disaster! I can imagine some situations where such a protocol would be useful, but not if you care at all about your data consistency. In that case, why use 2PC at all? Your conclusion is correct in that case: the resulting algorithm is not C or A.<p>Third, your confusion about CA is that you are trying to apply it to systems, like datacenters full of commodity servers and switches, that don&#x27;t really fit it. Imagine, instead, a system of two computers connected by multiple, redundant NICs and cables, located next to each other and communicating by sending messages. It isn&#x27;t hard to believe that you could build a system, like that, in which you could add algorithms that were CA: in other words, if someone cuts the cable, then all bets are off, but as long as those cables remain uncut, the algorithm guarantees consistency and availability. A better example is cache coherency protocols in modern processors, which are incredibly complex distributed algorithms working on CPUs that communicate over tightly integrated channels. Cache coherency protocols need to be CA, of course! If you somehow managed to severe the communication links without destroying the motherboard, you could break the algorithms assumptions, but that wouldn&#x27;t make it any less of a CA algorithm.<p>EDIT: Just to be completely clear: the CAP theorem only gives you a very small amount of information about a distributed system. As the author notes, multiple times, just because a system does not meet the &quot;A&quot; in CAP, does not mean it isn&#x27;t available. It could be 99.99999999% available, and still not meet the A in CAP. The same is true of &quot;C&quot;. That&#x27;s what makes CAP less useful for actually designing distributed systems: many of the choices you have to make come down to what you do when the system is not available, or not consistent.",1429897919

9434905,comment,9433801,9434682,0,0,mbreese,,,"I had a similar question, but my impression from the tutorial (and my pondering) is that you couldn&#x27;t really do a live migration with containers. I&#x27;m not sure it will ever be supported. I don&#x27;t think that the host would have enough information about the processes in order to capture their state and migrate running processes to a different host.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this would even be possible outside of a virtual machine. VM hosts have significantly more information and control about the VM than the container host has about the container. For example, a VM host knows exactly what memory is hot and what is cold to enable sub one-second switchover times.<p>It might be possible to add such support to the Linux kernel itself to support process migration between hosts, but that&#x27;s the level of work required.<p>The alternative that I was thinking about using your standard high-availability tools to create a new worker on the new host, then gradually remove existing workers on the old node. I think that might be the only way to really make &quot;live&quot; migrations work from a practical standpoint. For web-like services, this would work. For others, it may not be practical.<p>EDIT: Looks like the checkpointing running processes might work after all!

In some frameworks you may need to use a different element or an element that wraps another element to achieve certain functionality.<p>Some use generic names like &quot;button large&quot; as class names, but, again in my personal experience, it often causes problems. You might have other elements that need to be &quot;large&quot; and may need to be inside a button - but which &quot;large&quot; do you mean.<p>So to keep things predictable, I&#x27;ve adopted the following practices:<p><i>- Always namespace components.</i><p><i>- Always ensure that selectors work even if the child has a wrapper around it.</i><p><i>- Whenever possible use classnames instead of element names.</i><p>And to ensure I don&#x27;t get tendonitis (not sure if everyone agrees with this):<p><i>- If possible provide a shorthand for at least the most used components (i.e. &quot;col&quot;/&quot;col-i&quot; for &quot;collection&quot;/&quot;collection-item&quot;</i>",1429895939

In large scale retailers, the payment terminals would either be connected via Ethernet to the private point of sale (POS) network in the store where they could only talk to the POS controllers, or they would be connected via USB or custom serial cables (IBM) to the POS register itself and all communications would run through the software on the POS terminal.<p>This password isn&#x27;t the encryption key.  Usually keys would be injected into the terminal either remotely through the POS terminal, POS controller or by shipping a special card w/a magstripe to the store where the manager or loss prevention person would swipe the card on each terminal that has the new key on it.  PCI standards dictate that the retailer rotates the keys on a schedule with a documented procedure.<p>Changing the merchant ID probably would have little effect in most operations because the transactions aren&#x27;t going directly to the MC/VISA/etc network, but are passing through a dedicated link to the merchant&#x27;s acquiring bank.  I&#x27;ve never tested this, but I would imagine that the acquiring bank would reject transactions that are for merchant IDs that do not belong to the customer that is leasing the connection.

Of course that assumes a structured interview from competent interviewers, which is more the exception than the norm.<p>What interviews may lack in utility for predicting good performance they can potentially make-up for in determining cultural/supervisor-candidate fit. But this also requires the interviewer to 1) accurately represent the culture and 2) to not implicitly discriminate with things that might <i>correlate</i> with fit, which many things (age, religion, gender) might do. No simple ask there.<p>I think the primary value of interviews it that it makes the process seem more fair. Everyone had a chance to put their thumbprint on the experience, including the interviewee. In the absence of other selection measures (e.g., work samples) I understand its use, but if you have better tools then you should use those. For me, an interview&#x27;s primary outcome question should really only be &quot;Is this person completely unqualified or terribly unprofessional?&quot; If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, rely on the other indicators to make a decision.",1429894876

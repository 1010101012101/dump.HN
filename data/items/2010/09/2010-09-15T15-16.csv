When i first got interested in computers(back when my age was a single digit), i didn't follow role models, i just got drawn to these machines, almost instinctively, and not just computers, cars, electronics, any kind of machines. I had my technical influence of course, my dad knew a lot about machines and electronics, but i think its something a bit deeper. Men have been making tools for hundreds of thousands of years, in my complete lack of experience in genetics, i think its foolish to dismiss genetic factors. Which is not to say that role models and culture have no effect, i just think that it has less of an effect than genes.<p>Bottom line is that my politically correct(i hope) opinion is that while women positively have the ability do be good developers(physicists, mathematicians, engineers), and even though some of them DO become good, most lack this internal drive(almost an obsession) I've had since before i can remember.",1284566373

I've had varying degrees of success with developers in India (so-so work, terrible communication) and Pakistan (so-so communication, terrible work) before I tried the Philippines.<p>The consensus on the Philippines seems to be that they aren't as good as developers in Eastern Europe or India.  I don't know how anyone could paint a whole country with such a broad brush.  In reality, it's because Filipinos have such strong English skills compared to Eastern Europe or India that outsourcing companies swoop them up first and pay high salaries, leaving few competent developers for small businesses.

My recent example is seeing a cool car in London. Now that I know what it's called I can just search for ""morgan three wheeler"". But the first time 'round I started from ""three wheel oldtimer"" and probably a few others like that, then looking through a lot of wikipedia etc.<p>Until we can make search engines behave like asking a human ""Hey, that car looked cool, what is it?"" kids won't be avid searchers.",1284565368

1694447,comment,1693782,1693782,0,0,barkingcat,,,"Perhaps then the goal is to have a mutable pricing structure that responds to market pressure. If it really doesn't cost anything to produce 1 additional electronic copy, something like this might work.<p>At launch date / first to market, there is a high price tag for the digital good (whether it be music, game, movie, etc). This is so that the vendor/author can make sure that they can sell at a high price to those ""first movers"" that actually want to pay $1000 to be the first person on the planet to have that special ring tone, ahead of everyone else in the market, for example.<p>As time passes, and as more people buy the ""product"" (which is done via a download or a file transfer) - the price of the product goes down - because the as demand rises, the cost of production actually doesn't change - and the author already made some money, so there's no point being greedy, because then people would go and pirate it.<p>Once this price goes down, it goes down for EVERY SINGLE customer, including those who bought it during the high initial price. I mean, the vendor does have the customer's credit card numbers. Do a residual, scaled, periodic refund for every single customer, based on the differences between the current discounted price and the original price at which the customer bought the good.<p>As the # of units sold increases, the price of the product decreases - of course the relative rates can be tweaked so that the vendor is still making more money than they are discounting, because as an electronic/digital good, there are no factories or warehouses - it's easier to make money at mass scales when it comes to digital goods (vs physical goods like bicycles).<p>Existing customers feel validated - the more people they recommend to buy the product, the more money they get back.<p>New customers don't feel like they're getting ripped off - the prices are falling all the time, and you ""buy into"" a whole discounting structure.<p>The original vendor/producer can finely tune the ratio at which the prices fall in order to control profitability, popularity, and sales rate as a factor in promotion and marketing.<p>Again, if you take advantage of the fact that if you sell 10 copies, the cost for building the software/digital good is no different from when you sell 100,000 copies, then you can exploit that ""efficiency gap"" if you can call it that between the existing pricing structures and a variable pricing structure that I describe.<p>At some point, you will reach a ""price floor"" at which the producer is comfortable reaching their target cumulative total profit. Since altering the price changes the price for every single customer since the beginning of the lifetime of sales for the product, you can actually say - I want x million for this product in 3 years time - and actually be able to hit that target by planning out the way the price changes. OR if you believe in the long tail, go ahead and have a constantly decreasing price - as you reach the hundreds of millions of people in the long tail, you can charge 1 cent - and you would get hundreds of millions for a product you made - providing usefulness for all those people at a great price - AND being able to protect your livelihood during those critical first few sales.<p>Of course, this requires every single sale to every single customer to have its own merit, its own tracking system, its own values. BUT personalized sales is exactly what we are looking forward to in the future.<p>And I think technically, it's not super hard - I mean we have nonstop systems and mainframes and clusters of all kinds - that analyses the trillions of collisions in the LHC - what makes us think that we can't track six or seven billion consumers who are alive on this planet, who might be making 5 or 6 million transactions a year?

He said he didn’t think that was necessarily the case, because kids in the upper age range of the study — 11 and 12 years old — were observed to be avid searchers.</i><p>Further, the study itself (<a href=""http://www.nngroup.com/reports/kids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nngroup.com/reports/kids/</a>) was on how children used <i>websites</i>. Not on how children used the <i>the internet</i>. As far as I can tell, he means that children did not use the search features on a particular website. Which I rarely do, too. If I need to search a website, I usually do a search on Google. I've learned that most websites have terrible search results.<p>But even if the study had demonstrated that young children don't use search engines to navigate the internet, it wouldn't necessarily mean that future generations will use the internet differently. I think people tend to underestimate how subtle searching the internet can be. We see a single text box on Google's homepage, so it has to be simple, right? But that implies that the work to figure out what to put in that text box must happen in our heads. Being able to synthesize what you want to find into a few keywords that you think are likely to be associated with what you're looking for requires sophisticated cognition.<p>That, to me, would be an interesting psychology topic to study: how early can we effectively search the internet?

Unless you're at a fast food restaurant where it's posted on the menu, people really are bad at guestimating these things.<p>Change the health ranking to a taste ranking, and have it be for specific dishes at specific restaurants. While Foodspotting is sort of playing in that space, they are just asking people to submit pics of stuff they like, sans rating. While it's great to know what people like, I also want to know what to avoid. And it's much harder to sort through comments than it is to glance at numerical ratings.<p>Use case: I go to Corner Bistro for the first time. I do a search for Corner Bistro on Eatly. I see that Eric has had the cheeseburger and that Mike has had the chili and fries. With ratings added, I see Eric gave the burger a 9, but Mike gave the chili a 5, so I'm going with the burger.<p>In the same vein, using tags and descriptions, aggregate photos and average scores for menu items at restaurants. So I look up Corner Bistro, and I'm presented with a photo (the top ranked photo?) and average taste rank for each item on the menu. It's the Waffle House of Menupages [and I just created a new vertical].<p>And, yes, eventually it could suggest restaurants and dishes based on my activity and that of friends.<p>Obviously need to make the entry process as frictionless as possible. Few different thoughts there:<p>1) Expand current email capabilities, a la Posterous. Use special characters to note the restaurant name, add tags, rate the item, etc.
2) Automate and outsource: map EXIF data to restaurants (imagine you guys could find a database like that somewhere...), superusers for aggregating and tagging, etc.

My next step is to either sort by those filters, or individually click a restaurant. Looking at an individual restaurant, my options for consideration are photos of the restaurant, consisting of either interior/exterior or images of the food, and user reviews. The user reviews consist of reviews about the service, atmosphere and food, but I have to chug through each review to get this type of specific information. And with a task of choosing a restaurant and having to repeat these sets of actions is immensely tedious.<p>What's missing?<p>A way to discover restaurants near me that I can discover by their actual dishes. The user flow would be this -> I'm in the mood for a burger. Show me restaurants that serve burgers. I get a range of places from diners to more high-end to delis and more, but instead if getting a list of joints, I get a sortable grid of user's burger photos from places near me. Then, all I need to do is say, that burger is the one I want and, barring other misc info such as price or needing reservations and what not, I will go there and get the burger that I saw with my own eyes.<p>The advantage you will have over Yelp is that While Yelp provides a way to discover restaurants by very general filters, you will provide a way to directly discover restaurants by the actual individual dishes.<p>As a side note, think about when you go to a restaurant and get a menu that has pictures. It gives so much more reference to choosing a dish, because the mystery is taken out of the equation. Your service would do exactly this. Remove the mystery of what you're going to a restaurant for.<p>Also, while you can see some food items on Yelp in the individual restaurant pages, #1 they come with no context and #2 I can only access these photos on these individual pages which is tedious.<p>There you have it.",1284563107

Today however, the SandForce based Vertex II Pro SSDs are amazing. 10K+ IOPs sustained with a genuine database load. 100GB for just over $600. Compare that with STEC Mach8 devices at ten times the price, not super-capacitor backed, and lower throughput.<p>Sure a couple JBODs stacked with 15K RPM disks could do the same for $50K... Now imagine a small single-parity array of four SandForce devices. ;-)<p>For most things, meh.

Celebs and others ""blocking"" questions is something that happens when anyone is trying to protect their image.<p>In addition, having a single list of questions and a Twitter-centric @(some_id) way of referencing people and other entities (corps, brands, etc.) seems limited. Why not have a search page that has mined names from Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.? Also, for the the selectbox currently being populated with suggestions in the upper-right, how do you determine how many of the multitude of people should show up? It would seem that eventually there will be too many to pick from that easily? I think a more advanced search is in order, and possible a dedicated page.<p>Finally, the name looks a little like Apache Commons was taken over by Russia. :) I say that somewhat jokingly, but remember the made-for-T.V. series ""Amerika"" in the 80s? All it takes is changing a C to a K and you have added a little cold-war Russia flavor, at least to older Americans that remember it: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092316/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092316/</a>",1284562800

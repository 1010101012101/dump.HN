6701769,comment,6701630,6701630,74,0,ChristianMarks,,,"Technical work, including indispensable scientific software development, tends to be considered of low academic value in academia. This is an ingrained attitude. I very recently left after having heard &quot;oh, you&#x27;re the technical guy&quot; once too often from other academics.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. The Globus Online grid ftp service web page intended for users adopts an overtly apologetic tone [1]. Users of this service are promised freedom from &quot;low-value IT considerations and processes&quot;--considerations and processes that the Globus Online team has humbly sought to undertake on their behalf. I have to laugh at the claim that there is &quot;No need to involve your IT adminall you need is Globus Online.&quot; The message is that information technology is of low academic value--unless you happen to have been one of the authors of publications that came out of the Globus Online project. If not, your career is sidelined.<p>Software development, system administration, network administration and desktop support have become somewhat specialized in the past 30 years, but in the minds of some principal investigators and academic administrators, these very different activities are conflated. An expert in numerical methods, computational fluid dynamics and dynamic downscaling methods for climate assessment models is a seasoned web developer with a portfolio, fluent in jQuery, underscore, backbone, responsive websites with bootstrap, CSS3, HTML5, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, the Google maps API, Cartodb visualizations, as well as an Android developer conversant with the SPen library for the Galaxy Note 10.1. It&#x27;s as much effort to stay current technically as it is to keep up in the scientific literature.<p>There are faint signs of improvement. On January 14th, the NSF revised the biosketch format by changing the <i>Publications</i> section to <i>Products</i> [2]. &quot;This change makes clear that products may include, but are not limited to, publications, data sets, software, patents, and copyrights.&quot; The previous biosketch format was awkward for software developers, inventors and producers of data sets.<p>Recently, a number of prominent computer scientists, and scientific software developers affiliated with the Climate Code Foundation [3], published a Science Code Manifesto [4]. The manifesto includes the recommendation that &quot;software contributions must be included in systems of scientific assessment, credit, and recognition.&quot; Software developers in the digital humanities may wish to add their names to the list of signatories.<p>Whether these developments reflect a broader understanding that software developers ought to enjoy greater recognition and opportunity for advancement in academia that they do currently remains to be seen. Greater career advancementopportunity for software developers, inventors and data set producers working in academiamight do something to address the Ph.D. overproduction problem.<p>But these developments were too little and too late for me. I left.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.globusonline.org/forusers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.globusonline.org/forusers/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13004/nsf13004.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13004/nsf13004.jsp</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://climatecode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climatecode.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://sciencecodemanifesto.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sciencecodemanifesto.org</a>",1384009184

6701765,comment,6701562,6701562,26,0,tashoecraft,,,"Everyone is all concerned about how teenagers are fleeing Facebook, but they all fail to realize why teenagers will head back to Facebook. It was originally designed as the online version of College, a way to interact with new and old friends. When all these kids leave their high schools and head off to college where are they going to keep in touch with their old friends, Facebook. When they meet someone new in College where will they add this new friend, Facebook. Facebook is the initial meeting point for new friends and then once you become better friends it is then that you follow and add them on other social media sites. If Facebook sees a huge decline in College age students in the next few years then I will be worried about their future, but until then it doesn&#x27;t matter what the teenagers do because when they begin to grow up, they will join the rest of society and use their Facebook. Teenagers are not the demographic to follow when understanding Facebook&#x27;s fate.<p>Also, they are all leaving Facebook to use intagram, a Facebook owned company, or use snapshat which will die off in popularity in the coming years.",1384009033

I learned Prolog before ever dabbling in Scheme or ML, and it was just as much of a paradigm shift from imperative style. It&#x27;s kind of like FP-style pattern matching, but taken to a whole new level, such that the pattern matching itself is pretty much the entire computational engine.<p>Rather than using functions, which take a number of arguments and return a result, you use predicates on a number arguments. You build your program out of clauses, which are conjunctions of predicates. A process called unification [1] finds the argument values (if any) that satisfy an entire clause. By sharing constants and variables between predicates, the valid results that unification can produce are restricted to what the logic of your program allows.<p>So your algorithms end up being, in many ways, description of what a valid results look like, and the Prolog engine goes out and finds them. This paradigm clearly maps nicely to domains with lots of rules, like decision engines, parsers, and such. Sounds awesome, right? One caveat is that, in practice, you as a programmer have to have a pretty good understanding of how unification works in order to write performant algorithms.<p>This is all from several years-old recollections and a little bit of Wikipedia to refresh my memory, so someone please chime in if I&#x27;m incorrect someplace or leaving out key concepts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_%28computer_science%29#Application:_Unification_in_logic_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_%28computer_science...</a>",1384008344

Unfortunately, SF.net&#x27;s issue system is nothing compared to what JIRA or Redmine can do right now.  While they have the File Release System or downloads, in theory, most places want that handled by a CI system -- something that Jenkins can do rather well with just about any type of file system or backend.  User management?  Most enterprises have some type of SSO or user management in place already, and the sf.net code didn&#x27;t have the ability to use another source for user management.<p>The only thing that SFEE did well was provide a single &#x27;neck&#x27; for customers to strangle when things went wrong -- and we became very, very good at keeping those customers happy.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for the last public release of the sf.net code, it&#x27;s from around 2003/2004, and it&#x27;s....messy.

But few know its substance.\nThe pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), is deliberately shrouded in secrecy, a trade deal powerful people, including President Obama, dont want you to know about. Over 130 Members of Congress have asked the White House for more transparency about the negotiations and were essentially told to go fly a kite. While most of us are in the dark about the contents of the deal, which Obama aims to seal by year end, corporate lobbyists are in the know about what it contains.\nAnd some vigilant independent watchdogs are tracking the negotiations with sources they trust, including Dean Baker and Yves Smith, who join Moyers & Company this week. Both have written extensively about the TPP and tell Bill the pact actually has very little to do with free trade.\nInstead, says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, This really is a deal thats being negotiated by corporations for corporations and any benefit it provides to the bulk of the population of this country will be purely incidental. Yves Smith, an investment banking expert who runs the Naked Capitalism blog adds: There would be no reason to keep it so secret if it was in the interest of the public.</i><p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/78324869"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/78324869</a><p>Edit: Missed Brunei (fact it is slightly smaller than Delaware, notwithstanding)",1384007165

The more information in the public realm, the more that scores of interested scholars, journalists, statisticians, lawyers and other such professionals can use the tools of their trade to come to useful conclusions. Of course, most people could do nothing with such information, but released into the wild, even minor outrage can cause real change.",1384006225

Being inflationary is imperative for the population to use it. It is true that currencies are forced upon population by governments (or any form of governance) and it&#x27;s true that anyone would rather be holding an <i>asset</i> that will not lose value over time compared to one that will.<p>Inflation is an indirect motive to spend money <i>today</i> and not hoard.<p>Now the above is the generally accepted <i>truth</i> in micro-economics and social theory, so I&#x27;m not feeling any heat proving the dominant view on this. It&#x27;s how our world uses currencies actually.<p>All in all, to me makes sense: a currency SHOULD lose a small (1% or 0.5%) amount of purchasing power over time, to boost commerce/spending and so on. It&#x27;s an indirect way but works. Until we find another way, I think we are stuck with it.<p>Bitcoin in my view, will never be a largely used currency because it does not have this imperative characteristic any currency should have. So people would rather spend dollars (as a user already said about PPCoin for example..) or any other inflationary currency instead of spending an asset.",1384005640

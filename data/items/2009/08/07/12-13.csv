In almost all cases, it takes longer for a bag to move between planes than it does for a human to move between planes.<p>Or, for that matter, to get back onto the same plane.  A couple of years ago, I was flying from Montreal to Vancouver, via Edmonton, with only 30 minutes scheduled to get between flights.  It turned out that the same plane was being used for both the Montreal-Edmonton and the Edmonton-Vancouver flights; I made the connection, but my suitcase didn't -- it was taken off the plane along with all the others, went into the airport's baggage routing system, and didn't make it through in time to get back onto the plane.",1249649818

And that means that the success of the project, in this case Wikipedia, and it's resulting effect on the world (or however that should be phrased) has already happened. And out of that unforeseen and unpredicted effects have also happened. And that now, armed with the knowledge of the current effects it's always easy to declare that said effect was actually our intent.<p>The article is clearly touching. But I wonder whether it really was an epiphany moment that created the motivation to create Wikipedia or whether it's closer to what I suspect which is that it wasa small action that was the right thing at the right time, that has snow-balled into something vastly greater, and that now it's easy to re-interpret the original small action into being of greater meaning than it is.<p>Of course, I also suspect I'm just a cynic.",1249649430

747476,comment,747434,747434,0,0,mseebach,,,"I'm pretty sure that most luggage is lost when connecting at a busy airport, and there's some kind of glitch in the baggage handling at the airport. It's doesn't have to be a system-wide failure, just a single truck-driver running late, because a loading-team is two down because of the flu, and 100 bags miss their connections. Naturally, they are given lowest priority (when running behind, better get as many bags as possible on the right flight in time - whats it worth moving one bag that's already missed its flight, instead of one that has a chance of making it).<p>The bag lie around until evening when the pace slows down, and the remaining bags are routed to the relevant flight. But it might be a while until a there's flight in the relevant direction, and there might not be enough room on it.<p>At the destination airport, the bag waits around for a courier pickup, and that might take a while, because the airline wants to get as many bags as possible on the same pickup, because it's cheaper/easier.<p>I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure: At NO point during this process doesn't the airline know exactly where the bag is. Barcodes are not at fault here, RFID won't fix it -- the problem is overloaded systems, delayed flights and overly optimistic connection-times are.<p>They don't tell you this, because it's simply easier not to. If they telling you one thing, they'll soon end up rationalizing every single decision they take regarding every bag to everybody. It sucks but the alternative sucks more.<p>Upgrading baggage handling is expensive, and there are only the carriers, which in turn means the passagers, to pay for that.",1249649354

747471,comment,746873,747299,0,0,kls,,,"it is not a problem with OOP so much as it is with the abuse of OOP, which is easy to do. Bad developers put the work flow procedures in objects and treat it as if it can be used as traditional OOP. but the truth is that work flow is usually task specific and not reusable. It lends itself better to procedural programming. Good OOP programmers know to stuff this stuff in thread safe static subroutines(methods) and provide a service layer for all work flow. it should not be embedded in objects (i know technically the static methods are in an object). Unfortunately this has also caused another bad OO problem with anemic objects. If you look at MVC implementations like struts it has caused a new bad habit in which objects are used for nothing more than structures and all of the logic is implemented in the work flow. Reusable business logic should be implemented as methods on the object in which they relate to. User specific work flow should be abstracted away from the objects and the UI should be loosely coupled to the work flow through a service facade. Alternatively if you have a group of good OO programs you can implement the work flow elements in a reusable event based system where reusable paths can be developed and listeners can chain in for very specific non-reusable tasks, but this is very hard for a junior to follow so many good developers opt for the first pattern because it allows them to train new developers on the system, without having to teach a programmer event based techniques. I don't know why it is so hard for people to grasp OO, but it does seem like it is much easier to create a hideous unwieldy beast with it, than procedural, in the hand of the wrong developer. Conversely, some of the most elegant systems that I have seen where done with OO languages and properer delineation between the data systems the business model and logic, the work flow and the interface.<p>Anyway, long story short when I see a huge stack chain, general they are either do anemic objects and just hacking up the big controller procedure into a bunch of little functions or they are doing OO work flow, either of which is not an appetizing prospect to support or fix. Evey once and a while you will get someone that is doing factory patterns everywhere which can create a lot of deep dives down the stack to figure out that the 17 methods deep stack finally results in one method creating a object.<p>P.S. Private subroutines do not have to be reusable public ones should be. The author did not specify. so I hope and assume he was talking about public subroutines.",1249648895

747466,comment,746873,746967,0,0,tetha,,,"I think LISP, Haskell and 'Learning Lisp' or 'Learning Haskell' is nothing one should take too literal.<p>I think the point behind such statements is the point, that Lisp and especially Haskell today are very, very advanced languages with very, very advanced and abstract concepts (best example: Monads.). If you 'Learn Haskell', or 'Learn Lisp', the speaker will usually mean: Learn these abstract and advanced concepts. Learn to love homoiconic languages such as Lisp, Factor, and learn to love the mathematic backgrounds in haskell, with its Monads, Types, Monoids and whatsoever. If you have groked those concepts, you will usually make a serious step on the ladder of good programmers.<p>However, as 'Learning Lisp', or 'Learning Haskell' are just a way to say to learn these very advanced concepts, it can be very possible that one knows these concepts by heart already. So, if you know functional programming, the most interesting part about lisp reduces to macros, pretty much. (I know, I will be bashed, because there will be one or two interesting features I forgot, because I did not venture into the LISP-Land too much, because the madness of interpreters and such was too big for me, but the point still stands.)",1249648464

747449,comment,747030,747030,0,0,etal,,,"A gem:<p><i>The better part of learning is making mistakes, and most grading penalizes mistakes.</i><p>This is true; it makes students unadventurous. Fortunately, most science PhD programs already work nearly the way he's proposing:<p>- Students are attached to a lab early on, and mentored by a professor for the rest of the program<p>- Classes related to the degree usually allow enough flexibility in the assignments that a student can find a way to apply their lab's line of research to the current topic<p>- Students take 2-3 lecture-style courses and a scattering of seminars each semester for the first two years or so, then focus entirely on research (mentored, of course) for the rest of the program<p>- Grades are implicitly just a formality. Maybe not everyone figures this out, but you're doing things properly in science course, you will get an A. Don't even worry about it; just focus on your research and let the prof know you're learning something. In a PhD program, your report card is really your list of publications -- and that's another can of worms.<p>The biggest departures from this I see are in law, business and med schools, where there's a secondary goal of filtering students up front. (And they charge so much for the honor. Science grad school isn't so much a hefty up-front investment as a temporary oath of poverty.)<p>My program is a mix of CS, math/stats and biology, and it's interesting to see how the disciplines collide in the curriculum committee. CS and math/stats teachers <i>do</i> have a lot of material that simply must be lectured to students, with lots of targeted exercises along the way -- these professors push for more core courses. Science teachers constantly try to trim the core requirements so students can spend more time in the lab, doing real research, without distractions. I don't think this dynamic would have evolved if the department was simply following the rote lecture-and-exam tradition.",1249647435

But we look at what position open office is placed in <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001215.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001215.html</a>, yet OOo has the daunting task of being a true competitor against Microsoft office, an office suite backed by a huge organization, even when compared next to Sun. I guess, from their perspective, they can mimic all MS Office's features within OOo and offer their product for free, and maybe that's enough to compete, but then it doesn't make OOo much better than it's competitor, it really just makes it a free clone, which is disappointing because it can be so much more.<p>Personally, my experience with the ribbon was negative, I thought it took a lot of screen real estate (especially since I always worked on a laptop) and essentially disrupted my previous toolbar work flow that I had spent time customizing. Whether OOo is making a 1 to 1 copy of the ribbon, I don't know, I haven't used it in such a long time, i forget what it looks like, but the opinion on the matter seems clearly laid out on the topic link.<p>Now that they are doing a UI redesign, now is a good time to define themselves, a lot like how Blender is and always has defined itself with it's UI <a href=""http://www.cgcookie.com/articles/blender-25-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cgcookie.com/articles/blender-25-overview</a>. What blender has done was always amazing, and now, with 2.5 they are doing it again! that's crazy! and no one would ever call Blender a maya clone, or a 3dsmax clone. So i think, cloning something isn't really healthy, you don't create an identity, and I fell now OOo has a chance to finally define itself, do a little UX research and really define itself for it's users, create a different and better user experience we look out for and talk about and really compete with MS Office by offering something new.<p>If they don't do this now, then it's as if (us Linux users) we're never going to amount to anything more than users of a Clone platform in the desktop space, and at that point, we might as well cede: <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5290955/mac4lin-gives-linux-desktops-the-complete-mac-look"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5290955/mac4lin-gives-linux-desktops-t...</a>",1249647167

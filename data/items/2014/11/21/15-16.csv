You can&#x27;t just price at what you think the market says they are willing to pay. They may say they are only willing to pay $1/month.

Figure out your labor costs associated w/ maintenance and additional features (don&#x27;t forget to account for future hires). Price at that amount plus some profit (something like 10% or 20% if you have high labor costs. Don&#x27;t be afraid to stretch that percentage higher too.)\nIf you can&#x27;t find a price point that covers your costs, but is in a range that users are willing to pay for, than you don&#x27;t have a business.<p>Entrepreneurs often forget that you can build this kickass product that every user needs, but if the customer doesn&#x27;t have a high enough ROI they won&#x27;t buy the product.<p>User != Customer",1416585344

They had a decent presence in New York City, and as the company expanded across the country reporters cited customer numbers in the mid five figures.<p>As an Aereo user, let me tell you what you missed out on: one of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>Aereo &quot;worked.&quot; It worked like magic.<p>First, it lived up to its claim. You could stream live, broadcast television to your phone or computer, and you could AirPlay it to your television. Everything was in HD. It worked incredibly well. So many video products fail to deliver on the user experience, or the video is choppy, or it crashes all the time. Aereo&#x27;s software had its struggles, but it worked far more often than not. I could have people over and stream the Super Bowl and never worry that Aereo would crap out.<p>Aereo also worked remarkably well during Hurricane Sandy. I live in Brooklyn, and Aereo&#x27;s Brooklyn HQ was less than a mile from my apartment, but we streamed Aereo until we went to sleep that night. Considering reports that their antennae sucked a ton of power, that&#x27;s incredible on a night when power was out all across the city.<p>I also interviewed with the company in 2013 for a business development role. Everyone that I met was really great. They treated me well during the process while clearly balancing a million things, including their legal concerns. I really, really wanted to work there, but it wasn&#x27;t a fit for a lot of reasons, their uncertain future being one of them.<p>When my girlfriend told me that they were filing for bankruptcy, I was sad. This is innovative technology that worked for consumers, squashed by antiquated government regulation and a highly litigious, innovation-resistant, influential media industry.<p>Progress, halted.<p>A winning product that could have delighted millions, squashed.",1416585228

What FIX tags are involved? Give me an example&quot;. Many people would seriously envy you if you told them what you do.<p>BTW, many startups (not all) are all about the kludge : they are always in a time crunch and that&#x27;s why languages that allow rapid iteration such as Ruby or JavaScript (quick wins, but long-term technical debt accumulation) win out over the more sturdy-but-time-consuming enterprise choices such as Java or C++. If your startup may not even exist 3 months after inception, it makes sense to rapidly discover if we can even get customer no. 1. For Goldman Sachs or other big bank with deep pockets, they can afford to allow you time to do things the right way from day one.<p>For some people, kludging is a personal habit. It is a dangerous one. One suggestion I have is to spend at least an hour daily on reading.<p>The way I see it, you only need a change of job to a better pay and more respect than $125k in NYC. You may be happy after that + finding more like-minded friends outside work? (maybe attend some tech meetups on meetup.com in NYC?) If your heart strings still tug at you, you can always consider switching over :-)<p>I used to work in the financial industry and switched over to a startup recently, but it was a decision that made sense for ME, not necessarily others.

I&#x27;m a big fan of Le Guins fiction, as well as her commentary and critique of literature as commodity.<p>Another great (anti-capitalist) novelist who I admire, China Mieville, touched on some similar topics in his keynote speech at the Edimnburgh International Book Festival a few years ago: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/china-mieville-the-future-of-the-novel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/china-mieville-...</a><p>&quot;But who decides who qualifies as a writer? Does it take one sonnet? Of what quality? Ten novels? 50,000 readers? Ten, but the right readers? God knows we shouldn&#x27;t trust the state to make that kind of decision. So we should democratise that boisterous debate, as widely and vigorously as possible. It needn&#x27;t be the mere caprice of taste. Which changes. And people are perfectly capable of judging as relevant and important literature for which they don&#x27;t personally care. Mistakes will be made, sure, but will they really be worse than the philistine thuggery of the market?<p>&quot;We couldn&#x27;t bypass the state with this plan, though. So for the sake of literature, apart from any- and everything else, we&#x27;ll have to take control of it, invert its priorities, democratise its structures, replace it with a system worth having.<p>&quot;So an unresentful sense of writers as people among people, and a fidelity to literature, require political and economic transformation. For futures for novels – and everything else. In the context of which futures, who knows what politics, what styles and which contents, what relationships to what reconceived communities, which struggles to express what inexpressibles, what stories and anti-stories we will all strive and honourably fail to write, and maybe even one day succeed? &quot;",1416584595

8641711,comment,8635543,8639125,0,0,CocaKoala,,,">if you are playing actor &#x27;A&#x27;, and I am playing actor &#x27;B&#x27;, we state the game &#x27;balanced&#x27; if every offensive action that &#x27;A&#x27; has, has an equivalent defensive action on &#x27;B&#x27;s part, and vice versa<p>But that&#x27;s not what balance is at all. I&#x27;m going to go to some fighting games here, because I really like them and it&#x27;s an easy way for me to contextualize balance. I apologize if I&#x27;m referencing a game you&#x27;re not familiar with, but I&#x27;ll try to be clear.<p>Guilty Gear (and its various sequels; right now I&#x27;m thinking of Guilty Gear XX Reload ^ Core, but that&#x27;s super long to type) is generally considered to be a fairly balanced game, but the cast of characters is incredibly diverse. Venom can place pool balls on the screen in various formations, and if he hits them with any attack, then they bounce around and hit the opponent. Zappa can summon random creatures to give him access to new attacks (seeded by the clock, which skilled players can use to their advantage). Eddie has a secondary effect where he does one attack when you press a button, and a second attack when you let go of the button. Chipp has teleports and a triple jump that lets him move around the stage quickly.<p>You can&#x27;t say that each character in Guilty Gear has an equivalent defensive action for every tool that every other character has, because there are just so many characters and so many different tools. Instead, each character has a generalized set of defensive options: a double jump and air dash for mobility, an attack that has upper body invincibility (and so can be used as a defensive move against air attacks), an attack from blockstun that has brief invincibility but costs a small amount of meter, and a rechargeable &#x27;burst&#x27; that can break out of an opponent&#x27;s combo. So now, even though every character has a myriad array of ways to attack you and there&#x27;s no way to say &quot;My burst is equal to Venom&#x27;s pool balls, my dead-angle attack is equal to Zappa&#x27;s dog, my anti-air is equal to Chipp&#x27;s triple jump&quot;, the game is still overall balanced.<p>I would say that your example of R-P-S with stages is still unbalanced; in underwater environments, there&#x27;s no situation where you don&#x27;t want to choose rock. In volcanic environments, there&#x27;s no situation where you don&#x27;t want to choose rock. The addition of the stage has removed all the strategy from the game.<p>> The short version is that widening the problem space from which you have to create a winning strategy makes it more interesting to me.<p>This part, I absolutely agree with; I feel like you just took it in sort of a weird direction. You don&#x27;t want to give everybody an equivilent set of tools, because that doesn&#x27;t widen the problem space at all (because the characters are all equal, so the choice doesn&#x27;t matter). And adding in effects from the environment is a way to widen the problem space, but certainly not the only one; you can go the Guilty Gear route and make sure that the system itself gives characters some good ways to get out of trouble, and then give each character an incredibly diverse set of offensive options and the problem space is sufficiently widened that way.",1416584293

In fact, that is what intrigues me most about the abstraction.<p>Transducers are defined such that you can abstract the context of input, output and iteration and focus on the transformation of each element from an independent source individually. The implementation of each transducer accepts another transformation in a &quot;pipeline&quot; (eventually the output sink) and accepts an input during an external iteration process.  The implementation decides what to do with it (map changes with a function, filter ignores certain values with a predicate, etc.) You can also define transducers that send multiple values for each input (think string.split) or some that do not send any until completion (think buffered results).<p>Since the iteration source and sink are abstracted from the transformation, you can use the same transformation in other contexts (Promises, event streams, IO streams, CSP, etc.)<p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with transducers in asynchronous contexts in JavaScript if anyone is interested, for example:<p>[1]: <a href=""http://simplectic.com/projects/underscore-transducer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplectic.com/projects/underscore-transducer/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://simplectic.com/projects/underarm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplectic.com/projects/underarm/</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/transduce/transduce-async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/transduce/transduce-async</a>\n[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/kevinbeaty/transduce-stream"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kevinbeaty/transduce-stream</a>\n[5]: <a href=""https://github.com/transduce/transduce-push"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/transduce/transduce-push</a>\n[6]: <a href=""https://github.com/transduce/transduce-then"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/transduce/transduce-then</a>",1416583401

Don&#x27;t let them forget you.<p>> co-authors might remember me when they&#x27;re starting a new research project<p>If you&#x27;re co-author with someone, that is a pretty good start! The work of networking is to take the &quot;might&quot; out of the equation. If you stay in touch with them regularly, they will definitely remember you.",1416582238

Cut the strip into segments and mount to particle board (perhaps with a picture frame in mind), making sure to stagger the position of the LEDs. If your board is non-conductive, you can mount thicker gauge stranded copper wire to either side of the board, and bridge the appropriate pin on the LEDA strip by soldering a short bit of wire to the power channel.<p>As far as electronics projects go, this one is pretty easy, and 5m of LED strip throws a lot of lux.",1416582209

Sound suddenly being muted, it using the wrong alsamixer settings, sound being garbled until you pass in arcance settings or change it back to Alsa. Granted, the error might be more in part of the rest of the ecosystem, though I doubt it. But it is sadly far from &quot;just use pulseaudio and everything will work instantly&quot;. And if it works, there is no need to think that Alsa alone wouldn&#x27;t have worked as well, the configuration was way less brittle and cumbersome than it is described now. Mostly it just worked.<p>It is only since 14.04 that you have a small chance that opting to use pulseaudio is the better choice.<p>Just trying to get Skype working (which uses pulseaudio) cost me 2 hours last week, which is not at all nice when you have a call starting in 5 minutes.",1416582143

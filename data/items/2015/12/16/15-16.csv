10745072,comment,10735840,10744213,0,0,scott_s,,,"Picking the right data structure and algorithms gets your code in the right algorithmic complexity range - did you implement a naive linear algorithm, or did you figure out a way to make it logarithmic? Or maybe even average-case constant? Compilers are generally not good at making optimizations that change complexity class. (Possible, yes, but not commonly.)<p>That&#x27;s not what jordigh is talking about. Let&#x27;s say you figured out a clever way to get your problem to O(<i>log n</i>). That&#x27;s definitely your job. But in practice, constants matter - that is, 10 <i>log n</i> is way, way worse in practice than 2 <i>log n</i>, even though they are both O(<i>log n</i>). And that&#x27;s the kind of optimization that compilers may be better at than you. Once you have convinced yourself that the performance of some component matters, a good principle is to figure out the best complexity class you can (using the &quot;right&quot; data structures and algorithms), then write the most idiomatic code possible.",1450281555

But I will respond to your post in a serious manner nonetheless.<p>Your second sentence perfectly illustrates the point the article is trying to make, that &quot;the increasing moralisation of mundane choices is strongly associated with the phenomenology of interminable inescapable guilt&quot;. As the article argues, when we overload our moral judgements by making every single act a moral deliberation, one measurable effect will be an overall lessening of our moral convictions.<p>Yes, you only vote a few times every odd years. No, your tax dollars are not &quot;channeled in a particular direction&quot;. Yes, business interests are still fundamentally at odds with environmental concerns. No, the few pennies you spend on products of a particular business do not affect the business&#x27; behaviour. The amount of moral deliberation that is reasonable to &quot;demand&quot; for such a simple act should be proportional to the ratio of your expenditure versus the entire business size.<p>> And yes ethical consumption is complicated. A good starting point is to assume everything is tainted unless you know otherwise<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a useful starting point. If you start by assuming everything is tainted, you are already making a moral judgement about every purchase. Judgements and decisions cost mental energy, and we already know that mental energy is not infinite.<p>> That is, dont be pit off from trying to do one thing right just because you can&#x27;t do everything right.<p>But that is exactly what&#x27;s happening subconciously anyway: if we perceive (some of) our morals to be untenable (because of unrealistic demands, no way to actually make an impact, or general information/decision overload), that causes us to weaken all of our morals, even the ones we can affect.<p>Pick your battles, is what I&#x27;d take from this. And when evangelizing a cause, make sure the burden you&#x27;re placing on others is realistic.",1450281554

Other comments also go into why &quot;slavery&quot; isn&#x27;t even an applicable term.</i><p>Sure, lets hand wave stat inflation and questionable definitions, and accept NGO&#x27;s/governments/large corps have no control whatsoever compared to individuals as actors in a given society in how they aggregate data and generate their pretty plots.<p>><i>View the study, though, and it looks like there is exactly zero effort put towards manipulating or even exploiting technical definitions. Section 2 of the paper: &quot;Challenges in Trafficking Research.&quot; First problem: &quot;Definitional problems.&quot; It then outlines which definitions compete for dominance, why, and then plainly states which one it uses. For the record, it can be found here (<a href=""http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf</a>, Sec 103 Paragraphs 8 and 9) and seems to make sense.</i><p>Ok, the definition makes sense, so lets just accept it prima facie, and not question it or think about how we could improve upon it in certain ways that minimize even further how certain parties are negatively affected? How would people learn anything if we approached problems like that all the time? So just because one states how they&#x27;re defining something, it absolves them from critique if people disagree and wish for something more nuanced? lol<p>><i>Again, people can construct whatever idea or explanation they&#x27;d like. If you really want to believe something is incapable of good then you can easily make even the most benign acts look insidious. The question is whether or not you can substantively provide evidence for what is otherwise paranoia.</i><p>There would have to be a component of fear or anxiety for this to be true, which if one has neither (i.e. Me), casting such as paranoia in order to bolster ones argument because one may not think an NGO or its corporate sponsors are being upfront or relying on &quot;not being able to do anything about the definitions we benefit from at the expense of others to the degree of which we are not certain&quot;, then one must not &quot;believe&quot; (not sure why we have to believe when we can look at the definitional flaws that can negatively affect certain populations lives they may be seeking out) <i>anything</i> can be <i>good</i> is pretty weak, when noting how certain parties mere existence hinges on such (or at least their marketing pitches lol)… people are free to <i>believe</i> all the stat inflation they want, its not my time or after tax currency being sucked into the church lol<p>Do you work for Palantir or something?

10745009,comment,10736714,10739806,0,0,jawilson2,,,"I believe it completely. This was one of the first effects I felt, before I had gotten deep into the literature. I remember after being on keto for a week, I was walking through a parking lot, and all of a sudden it was like my head popped through the clouds. I had a sudden burst of energy, my anxiety dropped, and I felt like skipping to the car. The keto flu disappeared, and I felt HAPPY for the first time in years. All in the course of 5 minutes. Over the next few weeks, I realized this had extended to my work as well: I felt focused, clear-headed, and able to work more quickly than I had in years. I used to get 1-2 migraines per month. I haven&#x27;t had one in two years. I started the diet for weight loss (70 lbs now), unaware of the other benefits. It turns out this is starting to be supported by literature, though it is still a new area of study.<p>I started this because of my work in the pediatric epilepsy department I worked in. Nearly all of the kids that came through were put on a very low carb diet; it significantly reduced or eliminated the seizures in about 60%+ of the cases. Naturally, I wondered what was going on. It turns out that there are a number of neurological benefits. It has been shown to treat bipolar disorder [1], schizophrenia[2,3], ADHD[4], and so on. A lot of these are small studies. I am fine with that. If you have a patient who has been schizophrenic for 50 years, and no medication has worked, then a dietary change reverses most symptoms in a week, I feel comfortable saying something significant is happening, even with N=1. (A few years back at a Society for Neuroscience meeting, some NIH director made the point that if I say I have engineered a flying pig with wings, and bring it out on stage as proof, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to say repeat it 10 or 100 times; the proof is sitting in front of you!). I have only cheated twice in two years, and both times I was groggy for days, and felt the depression creeping back. I realized this was how I ALWAYS felt previously.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11918434"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11918434</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547882"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547882</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245705"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245705</a>\n[4]<a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/2/330"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/2/330</a>",1450281145

Models generate valuation under various conditions and sometimes these valuations are compared to available capital, but that is not enough.  Especially when your securities are held at banks that determine their valuations based on factors not included in your model.  If actual trdes are posting in similar securities at values that are very far from the model due to a liquidity or some other event then the margin calls will come in.

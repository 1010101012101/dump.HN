Joel Spolsky mentioned doing this in the article linked to from here yesterday, and I remember Chris Sacca saying that people really only did an hour or two of quality work every day at Google. My thinking was that the people we typically think of as smart are the people who are innovative and come up with new ideas. And new ideas tend to come from combining two or more fields. Which would give people who are a little bit ADD a huge advantage, though at the same time reducing the amount of actual work they are able to do on a day to day basis. ",1176735578

13298,comment,13205,13293,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Nice link :)  I guess my ""door desk"" is one step above Amazon as the filing cabinets look better (I use black ones that just happen to be exactly desk height) and don't cause injury on leg impact.  They do cost more depending on how nice your file cabinets are.  The alternative to filing cabinets are bolt on adjustable metal legs designed to hold doors - they cost about $15 apiece and look pretty good. <a href=""http://www.closet-masters.com/Table_legs/Camar/slim_legs.asp"">http://www.closet-masters.com/Table_legs/Camar/slim_legs.asp</a><p>Another great door holder (maybe the best) is a bookshelf from office depot: <a href=""http://www.officedepot.com/ddSKU.do?level=SK&id=718201&Nr=200000&N=201641&An=browse"">http://www.officedepot.com/ddSKU.do?level=SK&id=718201&Nr=200000&N=201641&An=browse</a><p>A good option: filing cabinet or shelves one side, legs the other.<p>I actually got the idea in 1989 when I was working for Paul Rudolph Architect in NYC.  He was doing major high-rises all over SE Asia at the time and billing at $360+ per hour (staff of 7) but still worked on his door.  He had designed a simple steel support structure that tilted the door for better drafting - analog drafting believe it or not.  That was 1 year before I went from pencil drafting to Cad.",1176733635

Fear of saying something revealing that might turn someone off. The headlines try desperately not to exclude anyone. In doing so, they succeed at boring everyone.""<p>Reminds me of Kathy Sierra.",1176733628

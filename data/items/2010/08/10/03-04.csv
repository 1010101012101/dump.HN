I can imagine a scenario where an IronRuby application could pass off a dynamically typed object to a shared library implemented in C# which supported DLR (dynamic language runtime) for some set of common functionality. I don't know much about what's possible today with respect to CLR objects passing between the DLR and the statically typed portions of the CLR, but I figured it was worth hazarding a guess.",1281412645

1590395,comment,1590197,1590197,0,0,DanBlake,,,"That depends on the scope and size of the attack.<p>If the attack is small, which the vast majority of attacks are, (either in bandwidth, packets per second, or both) then the responsibility is on the dedicated server owner to fix it via a software fix. (iptables with perl scripts to ban offending ips, etc..). If you have a managed host, they will obviously help with that.<p>If the attack is larger than that, but still not epic (say, 2gbps attack) then the responsibility is on the host/datacenter, who will most likely null route your server. What that means, is they will tell their upstream providers not to send any more traffic to your IP address and NOBODY will be able to access your site. This is done until the attack ends. If they dont null route your server, they will attempt to filter the traffic coming in themselves through a in house solution.<p>If the attack is of epic scale, it becomes less of a issue for the datacenter you are hosted in and more of a issue for the upstream providers to filter it on their end. A average datacenter can only do so much when 50gbps is coming in when they normally only see 10.",1281412611

1590380,comment,1589650,1590238,0,0,jsz0,,,"That's true however wired broadband is also oversubscribed in a similar way. A single DOCSIS channel can provide 38Mbit of bandwidth and it will typically serve ~250 customers. 250 customers @ 10Mbit each would require a 2.5Gbit/sec pipe at the access layer. For DOCSIS 3, 4 channel bonding, the real amount of wire bandwidth increases to 152Mbit/sec so to offer a 50Mbit connection to 250 customers your real maximum bandwidth needs balloon to over 10Gbit/sec. Cable is a bit unique since it's also a shared medium. Throwing more wire at the problem won't really help. It's a similar proposition to building many more cell towers with more antennas and transmitters to use spectrum more efficiently. It can be done it's just insanely expensive. Based on the VZ/Google deal I think the cable industry now has an excellent argument that they should be excluded from most rules of net neutrality.",1281412223

If I were 50-ish, I'd consider chasing people who will actually be comforted by dealing with someone their age, rather than a younger dude. I suspect they are out there.<p>However, you're jumping the gun a bit. Step one, do at least a basic sanity check on the skillset. Nobody, 50, 24, or 13, can jump straight into consulting without putting the time in to build at least some basic skills. Consider starting with some basic tutorials in the languages you know and make sure the temperament and skill sets truly are there before going too nutty about steps seven or eight.<p>(I was going to start recommending 'beginner' languages, but you're probably better off in this situation starting with whatever it is you and your brother know, on the assumption you want to help your dad get off the ground as quickly as possible and not just abstractly teach him something.)<p>Your dad might also surprise you; he has leverage into a world you don't and almost nobody here does, and exploiting that could prove surprisingly lucrative, and is probably also full of the aforementioned people who will find him comforting rather than ""old"".

1590376,comment,1589371,1590193,0,0,Groxx,,,"I've poked around with a number of the Big apps (from Adobe, Alias, etc), and at least a couple dozen smaller attempts.<p>The big ones <i>usually</i> keep up with my drawing speed, have nice pressure sensing, mediocre-to-decent pencil emulation (Adobe is particularly good, though struggles to keep up at times), and overall proper support for a tablet.  They also come with <i>squat</i> for organization: you're basically just dealing with files in folders.  I can do that in any application; I'm looking for something which myself and artists would actually <i>use</i>.  The vast majority of people I've seen using applications like these launch the files from Explorer: utter failure of the application to organize the files better, in other words.<p>The small ones come in all sorts of flavors, but thus far they've all failed on the organization front <i>entirely</i> if they support tablets, and are fairly weak attempts in ones that don't.  For instance: I know of <i>one</i> which lets you browse larger thumbnails with more detail and a more dense display than I can manage in my file browsers.  I know of <i>none</i> which support both tablets and tags.  Heck, I'd settle for a cover-flow-like interface if it loaded quickly, but the only place that exists is in Finder.  Surely a specialized application can do better and show more relevant info, given that it can make cached data.<p>Text in a sketch is, yes, very important, and has the upside of making it searchable: but again, I have yet to see one which lets you search across (a) folder(s), much less any other method of organization.<p>Thumbnails are uniformly full-'page' thumbnails: not informative at all for brainstorming sketches, as they're usually lighter and have more sparse info.<p>Usually, it's a large break in one's flow to create a new page to draw on; Alias' Sketchbook Pro did this decently, if I remember correctly.  But no others do, unless they're super-restricted sticky-note clones.  They're all: file -> new -> dimensions + background color + alpha channel + color system + would you like a goat with that?  Surely this can be chosen post-mortem if it really matters (unlikely for sketchers).  Default to a transparent sketching layer + a background color layer, so it can be separated if I decide I want to copy my drawings but not the background.  There are a couple decent infinite-canvas programs out there, but I have yet to see them in any pro-user apps, just for the low end of amateurs who <i>want</i> something restrictingly simplistic (nice, sometimes, and some of them are <i>excellent</i>, but then we're back to file management).<p>Tools are often Photoshop clones: tiny, fixed position, and require you to go across the screen to change basic properties.  They also take up <i>space</i>.  We've got gestures on our <i>trackpads</i>, but extremely few drawing applications make use of <i>any</i> kind of gesture (a few radial menus, but usually they're ""dumb"" with poor feedback and zero adapting for slightly off / too far / too short aim, especially ignoring pressure with a tablet).  Which is particularly strange when you consider all the gesture tools for <i>mice</i>, and then squat with a <i>tablet</i>.<p>-----<p>I should write a blog entry / post some of my more-developed thoughts on this.  I'm a little bitter :)  I'm also an application-testing-extremist, and I'm very likely reaching 10k applications across two OSs (many short-term, yes, but I've been at it for 15 years), so large-scale oversights / annoyances across entire genres which are solved in others bug me.<p>If you know of any sketching / drawing applications, I'd be more than happy to try them out, I've been away from them for a year or two and have no doubt missed hundreds I've never heard of.",1281412063

1590339,comment,1588688,1590205,0,0,ismarc,,,"Cable distribution of channels is completely different from the U-Verse example.  Cable uses a certain band of frequencies for channels, each HD channel requiring a larger band.  The Internet access they provide is delivered the same way, but with a smaller band for upstream.  The bands for Internet service are shared by all customers on the segment, with rate limiting at the maximum rate you're paying for.  For cable carriers, there is no ""profiling"" ability to prefer one over the other, they each have separate channels.  U-Verse and similar services (like the Verizon fiber solution) use a multi-homed router on your premise with one network for TV, one for VoIP and one for Internet.  They are all 3 IP based networks and travel over the same copper, meaning they share the same bandwidth, but only one of them is actually connected to the Internet.  For those services, you only receive the channels over the copper that your local router has requested the multicast streams for, allowing for a much more efficient use of the bandwidth but providing the possibility for services to interfere with each other.",1281410641

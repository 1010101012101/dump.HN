How nice it would be to only worry about what makes yourself happy.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion though that for the most part, someone&#x27;s level of empathy is mostly physiological/genetic and there&#x27;s little I can do to change that.

7085931,comment,7085682,7085682,21,0,lkrubner,,,"Most of the complaints in this article boil down to &quot;macros are too powerful.&quot; I think this is the key part of the argument:<p>&quot;A smart programmer is not necessarily an empathetic language designer; they are occupations that require different skillsets. Giving any programmer on your team the ability to arbitrarily extend the compiler can lead to a bevy of strange syntax and hard-to-debug idiosyncrasies.&quot;<p>There are at least 2 counter-arguments to this:<p>1.) in the simplest case, just restrict the use of macros. A team can easily adapt the rule that only the most experienced engineer on the team is allowed to write or approve macros. (And in my experience, the need for macros is fairly rare. I think my ratio is something like 100 or 200 normal functions for every macro that I write.)<p>2.) macros allow all kinds of interesting type checking, and data structure validation, and therefore they make it surprisingly easy to validate data and types as your data and/or vars get passed around your system. Consider all of these very interesting tools you can use in the world of Clojure:<p>Prismatic Schema which allows validation that a data structure matches a schema of (possibly nested) types:<p><a href=""https://github.com/prismatic/schema"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/prismatic/schema</a><p>and this now offers coercion, which makes this fantastic for importing JSON from other sub-systems or outside vendors:<p><a href=""http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2014/1/4/schema-020-back-with-clojurescript-data-coercion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2014/1/4/schema-020-back-w...</a><p>(I assume you could easily validate before giving data to Liberator to export your data while conforming to your schema: <a href=""http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/</a> )<p>There is work being done on an optional type system:<p><a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.typed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.typed</a><p>Much effort has been made to make contract programming easy in Clojure:<p><a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.contracts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.contracts</a><p>But also I find the built-in syntax for writing pre and post assertions is clean and easy to use:<p><a href=""http://blog.fogus.me/2009/12/21/clojures-pre-and-post/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogus.me/2009/12/21/clojures-pre-and-post/</a><p>In short, there are an abundance of mechanisms available with Clojure which help facilitate the enforcement of any kind of schema or contract, and some of these tools are enabled (and their syntax is made clean) thanks to macros.<p>In short: macros can be used for evil, but they can also be used for good. They are very powerful, so everyone should be judicious about their use, but there is no reason to argue that macros render a Lisp unfit for programming in the large.<p>Having said all that, I&#x27;ll remind everyone that the ultimate counter-argument is offered by Paul Graham, in his essay &quot;Beating the averages&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a><p>If that essay does not convince you of the value of macros/lisp, then nothing will.",1390164623

I think that this is also done out of ignorance, to a large extent. People hear about Scheme and Self being held in high regard, hear about some very vague similarities with JavaScript, and then assume that JavaScript is somehow like Scheme and Self, even if they&#x27;ve never used Scheme or Self. The supposed similarities only extend to JavaScript supporting anonymous functions and closures (just like numerous other languages) in the case of Scheme, or merely just sharing some terminology with Self.

7085927,comment,7084897,7084897,4,0,kodablah,,,"Does this have a WebRTC data channel client implementation, or does it solve more rudimentary aspects of WebRTC such as passing offers and answers (i.e. signalling)? This node module [1] is a client for data channels (but sadly no native Windows support yet which is a needed thing [2]). Once more widely adopted, WebRTC will be a great data communication method between users of all sorts of common-user desktop applications, not just browsers, mainly because of it&#x27;s NAT traversal techniques and encrypted-by-default requirement. In some instances a TURN proxy may be required (and the popular one [3] isn&#x27;t the easiest to setup, and doesn&#x27;t have a native-Windows-not-Cygwin install). This is especially true for users behind large corporate/government networks that don&#x27;t give you a single public IP per machine.<p>I have done a lot of work w/ WebRTC data channels recently and I am working on a POC for hosting one&#x27;s own &quot;page&quot; (i.e. facebook-esque profile page) themselves. WebRTC I think is the best technology so far for the decentralization of internet data from hosted servers to users. It still requires some server side things such as signalling (the handshake), STUN servers (external IP discovery behind a network), and TURN servers (proxies for complicated networks). By packaging up those three things into a single server that can be easily deployed by someone you trust (i.e. some kind of regional &quot;manager&quot; of sorts) and having good software to display web content over WebRTC data channels, a neighborhood-level darknet of sorts will be very feasible for even non-technical users.<p>1 - <a href=""https://github.com/js-platform/node-webrtc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/js-platform/node-webrtc</a>\n2 - <a href=""https://github.com/js-platform/node-webrtc/issues/42"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/js-platform/node-webrtc/issues/42</a>\n3 - <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/</a>",1390164573

The prospect is daunting.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really understand that point. In Racket, for example, programs macro-expand down to a very small set of primitives, such as `let-values` and `lambda`. This makes it easier to do analysis, not harder. For example, this is how something like Typed Racket can support every idiom in untyped Racket programs -- because they all expand down to a fairly manageable core set of forms. (Or if you need to analyze something no-so-primtive, you can stop expansion on whatever that is.)<p>Racket is descended from Scheme. I don&#x27;t know if CL or Clojure expand down to quite such a small primitive core, but I imagine the story is roughly similar?<p>Anyway, writing such tools is not what the average programmer would do on a putative large project.<p>Any large project needs technical and social norms, mentoring, and leadership -- regardless of language.

It was previously <i>Why Lisp isn&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t be) widely used in industry</i>, which colors my comment.]<p>This points out some very real potential dangers of large-scale collaboration with Clojure (and presumably some or many other Lisps/Lisp-likes).<p>However, I think the conclusion is overstated. Yes, based on what&#x27;s provided, it may take more discipline and better, more explicit processes for a team to effectively collaborate in Clojure than in Python (using the author&#x27;s running comparison). Yes, if we take this at face value, it does appear that people who depend on static analysis might find Lisp lacking.<p>But does this tell us why Lisp isn&#x27;t widely used in industry? If we assume that &quot;widely&quot; means &quot;as widely as Java or Python,&quot; which seems to be the statement made here, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s valid to cite the provided complaints as most or even a large portion of the explanation. The fact that there are no or almost no mainstream educational institutions teaching new students Lisp seems to me a far more likely candidate for front-runner on this issue.<p>That it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>widely</i> used is a little easier for me to agree with, only because I&#x27;m on board with some of the points here about the discipline and extra work it would take for a large team to effectively cooperate given the malleability of Lisp. I&#x27;ve worked with enough other programmers to know that kind of care and attention to process are very rare (and this isn&#x27;t &quot;all of you suck;&quot; I know I have and will again cut corners and ignore protocol in situations where time or resources make it hard to do things perfectly every time).<p>Also, I think the author&#x27;s last point is important to mention, because it&#x27;d be easy to miss it: He&#x27;s not arguing that Lisp sucks.

This is an ongoing problem with liberal copyright licenses in general; I often receive emails from people who ask me to release my software under MIT or BSD3 rather than GPL so they can &quot;relicense&quot; it, and sometimes even several back-and-forth emails are insufficient to convince them that copyright licenses aren&#x27;t mutable by anyone but the owner.<p>For the author of this piece, I think the solution is relatively straightforward:<p>1. Point out to the journal that having a photo in one of their articles does not grant automatic permission to put that photo on Wikimedia. If the journal&#x27;s software is unable to handle these cases separately, then the software should be corrected.<p>2. Ask Wikimedia kindly to remove the author&#x27;s photos from their collection, or at least correct the license metadata. I&#x27;m sure the Wikimedia editors would be willing to do this, though they might become unhappy with the journal editor who uploaded photos without permission.<p>3. If someone uses the author&#x27;s photos for commercial purposes, contact them and let them know that such use require a commercial license. They will likely be uncooperative (c.f. the various newspapers who like to source uncredited photos from Twitter), but some gentle reminders about copyright infringement&#x27;s RIAA-engorged penalties should bring them around.

When you&#x27;re sleepy, cranky, panic, and tired, skipping unit tests or a sort of individual code review is an excellent way to make negative ten hours progress.

And now suppose you have the skill of redirecting that firehose a bit, with the result that you can make one lucky person get $200k/year instead, while 11 other people get $90k/year instead of $100k/year.<p>Then your firehose-manipulation skills are worthless to society at large -- they reduce the net influx of money by $10k/year when you practise them -- but I bet you&#x27;d have no trouble finding someone sane and willing to pay you $50k/year to point the firehose their way.<p>(Of course in this exact scenario you would do better just to take the extra yourself; the real-world counterpart of the skill, though, produces gains roughly in proportion to the amount of money put in, and you can do better by persuading thousands of people to get you to point the firehose their way than by just working for yourself.)<p>I make no claim that the real-world finance industry is like that. But it illustrates schematically how something can be (1) of negative value to society as a whole and (2) something sane people are willing to pay for. And it&#x27;s not unreasonable to conjecture that a lot of the things investment banks and hedge funds do have something like the same structure.<p>Oh, one other thing. Suppose that actually the firehose distributes money very unevenly. Then you might do this: manipulate the firehose to benefit one set of rich people at the expense of another, take their money, and give some of it to poor people. Doing that might be substantially net <i>positive</i> to society. So even taking this rather cynical view of the finance industry, some people in it might be doing a whole lot of good on balance. (It&#x27;s called &quot;earning to give&quot; by the cool kids these days.

7085776,comment,7085028,7085650,59,0,phillmv,,,"It&#x27;s sorta up for debate.<p>My understanding, which is tiny and very limited, is that you can think of the role of finance operators as &quot;liquidity providers&quot;. They&#x27;re the grease in the wheels of capitalism; by either providing access to capital (via loans, or investment) or by matching buyers with sellers.<p>A classical example is you&#x27;re a farmer that wants to hedge the risk that your crop will fail due to random weather events or that there will be such a glut in the market that you won&#x27;t be able to sell your crop profitably. So, you enter a contract to sell your crop at a fixed rate long before harvest comes along. That&#x27;s a future contract, and it&#x27;s a kind of derivative.<p>So, derivatives can be really socially useful instruments. They can act like certain kinds of insurance, or allow you to capture different dimensions of value on assets that you already own.<p>However, and here&#x27;s where the argument comes in, it&#x27;s not clear that all kinds of derivatives provide socially useful forms of gambling. The prime example here is that of the collateralized debt obligation in which huge portions of the US mortgage market got sunk into.<p>Mortgage backed securities are probably not in of themselves <i>terrible ideas</i> but the way CDOs were structured made it impossible to objectively value the risk behind the instrument. It&#x27;s just not clear how a dip in the market might affect the value of your CDO tranche. It&#x27;s actually an np-complete problem - <a href=""https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/appel/intractability-financial-derivatives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/appel/intractability-fina...</a><p>Another example is high frequency trading - where you&#x27;re a day trader on steroids and have computers exchanging massive quantities of stocks based on fluctuations of fractions of cents. HFT people will argue that they provide more liquidity in the market - it&#x27;s easier to sell your stocks because HF traders increase the overall volume, etc. However, it&#x27;s in effect launched an arms race between different trading firms and some people say that they&#x27;re literally making money by skimming off everyone else who trades stocks. There&#x27;s a very reasonable argument that <i>we don&#x27;t want markets to operate faster than human perception</i>. If you have to make a decision about selling something, placing a ground foor and minimum transaction time of say half a second isn&#x27;t going to harm anyone who needs that liquidity for their business, or anything else that touches the &quot;real economy&quot;.<p>To summarize: certain kinds of financial instruments seem to provide no value above and beyond letting well-connected actors to place (potentially ridiculous) bets. Using your money, one way or another - whether it&#x27;s your farm, the mortgage on your house, or your pension fund.<p>--<p>If we accept the above as true, we can go further on a limb and ask questions about why is the wealth that passes through financial markets so liberally redistributed to people in the industry? Some people talk about it being a function of volume, but individuals are rarely if ever liable. When do they stop providing a service, and when do they start skimming off the top?",1390162332

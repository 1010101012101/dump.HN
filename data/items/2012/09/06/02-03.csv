It seems that much modern thinking on 'how the brain works', choices, and productivity is in line with what you are talking about here (that habit forming is essential, but most people's brains find a way to get in the way (or most people let their brain find a way to get in the way)).",1346900380

You'll go to the gym 4 times, and then get too busy to go. And then never go.<p>I think you have to force yourself to go for the first month or two. Set a goal. Lift X pounds. Run X miles.

A literal interpretation will not suffice to understand my meaning.<p>If you want it literally: the language this is written in is irrelevant, because the performance differences between the various languages are negligible next to the performance differences that come about due to the precise design of the website.<p>A poorly engineered website in a ""fast"" language will still be slower than a well-engineered website in a ""slow"" language. The actual language is completely irrelevant next to the implementation details.<p>>Also performance has a massive effect on how and what language a site is written in.<p>Not really. Experienced engineers understand that language is basically irrelevant for a situation like this. Whether it is written in Python or something else is irrelevant information.<p>Additionally, newbies tend to focus on ""language"" and ""language wars"" and the comparison between languages not for any engineering or technical reason. Newbies do this because languages represent buzzwords around which various communities congregate. The Python vs. Ruby fight is as irrelevant as the Presbyterian vs. Baptist fight. It is the psychological appeal of ""identity politics"" that motivates people to engage in these meaningless debates about buzzwords.",1346899704

4482623,comment,4482044,4482044,10,0,lathamcity,,,"I'm the same age as you, Dan, and just started to realize a similar thing.  Your post really struck home with me.<p>Right now I'm in the middle of a seven-month internship with IBM.  Back at the start, I distinctly remember when Hacker News was full of articles discussing 42 Floors' open job offer to you, and I felt miserable - ""I could be that awesome if only I managed myself better"" - and determined to spend the entire seven months in a mad self-improvement frenzy.<p>At the start of the summer I made this big sheet of paper with little letters and numbers next to each day to be crossed off.  There were different things I wanted to do each day - read a bit of this book, work a little on this project - and they were all meticulously planned out.  Since the work was divided up into such small chunks, however, it was easy to just miss one because ultimately it didn't matter.  I also resented that the paper was planning out my day so much.  Once I'd missed one, it was easy to miss another, and pretty soon it all fell apart.  I don't think it's a good idea at all to micromanage yourself this much.<p>Next, I tried making the goals slightly more long-term.  I divided up what I wanted to do into months instead of days, making columns for each month between now and January and writing down what I wanted to accomplish in each month, all the books I wanted to read, etc.  The problem again was expecting too much of myself and being too strict on myself.  When I wrote down a reading list, suddenly reading the books didn't feel enjoyable anymore - it was something I was forcing myself to do and so something that I <i>had</i> to do.  Even writing ""Do a Rails project"" made it less of an enjoyable experience because I felt like I was doing it because I had to instead of because I wanted to, even though I had only written it down in the first place because I wanted to do it.<p>I've grappled with the second goal set for the last two months, talking to my friends and discussing a lot of the same ideas that you wrote about in your blog.  I think you and I both came to the same conclusion, which is that you just need to have some vague idea of where you want to go and go there in a way that you'll enjoy.  When the inspiration hits, you'll be free and flexible enough to do something with it, instead of being imprisoned by goals.  So right now, my goals are just ""Learn more about algorithms and do cool projects"", which I'm enjoying a lot more.  In particular, I think that we as programmers have a bad habit of assuming that we're capable of a lot more than we actually are, an assumption that kind of handicaps us by making us think we can jump into things in an unrealistic way such that we feel frustrated when we're not as godlike as we imagined.<p>If this is utterly unreadable, thank Bill Clinton, haha.",1346899306
4482622,comment,4482228,4482351,5,0,mmahemoff,,,"Yes, I've implemented this kind of thing with <a href=""http://player.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://player.fm</a> and it's really a fundamental limitation of the HTML5 audio tag.<p>iOS is actually very cool in this department as it treats HTML5 audio as a native audio track, so it works with bluetooth controls, the play icon shows up in toolbar, works in the background, etc. Everything native audio does.<p>The reason next/prev doesn't work is because HTML5 audio has no concept of a playlist. It's just a dumb audio tag with exactly one source URL to play. So iOS really has no way to map what's going on in the browser into the usual concept of a playlist and it has no API to call to move to the next or previous track.<p>It's still well ahead of the other mobile OSs though, in the way it does at least treat HTML5 audio as standard audio, to the extent that's possible.",1346899297

4482613,comment,4481333,4482512,0,0,smartician,,,"I think you have it backwards. Being cautious is not fear-mongering. Do I think anything FDA approved will kill me directly? No. But I think the testing protocol is flawed. As far as I know, long term effect safety studies are only done on animal models. And the benchmark is always illness or disease, not optimal health. Nobody can ask a rat how it feels. And then there's the issue of synergistic effects. The FDA only studies substances in isolation, but there might be adverse effects that only occur if a substance reacts with another substance or process.<p>So, in short, if I can choose between a product that is ""natural"" or a product that has mystery substance X in it, I'd choose the natural one, even if it means I have to pay a little more. I'd also prefer it that product B is labelled in a way that I can tell it contains mystery substance X, so that I can make that decision. Is that fear-mongering? I don't think so.<p>Oh, and regarding carrageenan: It's not evidence, but I have personal experience that it makes my skin flare up, both when I ingest it and when I use it topically (shampoo for example). I later found out that the same stuff is used to provoke inflammation in animal experiments [1]. Do I still eat it from time to time? Yes, Ben & Jerry's is too delicious.

For example I had to order a replacement charger for an HP laptop a couple years ago and it was about $90.

There are many downsides to such a scenario: playlists are not searchable; their order is also fixed, which exacerbates the former problem when your playlists grow massive. From my understanding of the UI, the user's library is supposed to solve both issues, but it is not easily browsable on either iOS or Android (my unfortunate choices for consuming music). Perhaps, a workaround is to have ""smart playlists"" or optional tags for an album that you can come back to later.<p>It becomes a bit frustrating because basically the only way to listen to an album is to search for it. I'm mostly OK with that workaround, but the problem is that many albums have duplicates. I specifically select particular tracks I want in the library to make sure I can maintain consecutive playback of entire albums that do require it; a selection process which is rendered useless when re-doing the search from ground up on the go.",1346898534

4482576,comment,4481115,4481115,3,0,bane,,,"""Skeuomorphism helps people misunderstand the capabilities and limitations of digital products based on their understanding of a physical analog.""<p>Right. Nothing sets hard limits in a user's mind then guiding them to use a piece of software through a terribly flawed metaphor. My father learned to use computers in the mid-90s when he was in his 60s and his chosen tool was MS-Excel as it most closely represented the ledger system he used to keep his books with (which is of course what spreadsheets were intended for in the first place).<p>His world turned upside-down when I showed him that he could also do his production planning (he ran a small manufacturer) with it. Instead of painstakingly drawing the production schedule grid for the next day by hand, moving jobs from one day to the next, assigning employees to tasks and machines, etc. Spending 6 out of his 12 hour work day on it. He could do the entire job in an hour in Excel, and it was more flexible and he could make mid-day changes and print the schedules out with just a few minutes of moving cells around.<p>It blew his mind. He had been thinking of Excel only as a digital ledge, but now he thought of it as a giant grid. Soon he was mocking up purchase orders sheets, tracking suppliers, handling expense reports, doing inventory management, past-job database (with prices and pointers to physical samples in an organized warehouse) and other sorts of probably inappropriate tasks that simply required a grid layout and some basic content to frame the use-case.<p>What was important was breaking him out of the metaphor and suddenly he found a kind of self-actualization that freed him of hours and hours of hand written paperwork. It transformed his business and allowed him to handle quite a bit more business than he could before. His digital records were so good that when he sold his company he figures that it added 20-30% to the asking price for the company. If Excel has been even <i>more</i> skeuomorphic of a book keeping ledger, with stitched binding and a traditional two or three column ledger, he may never have been able to break free of that metaphor and realize his other efficiencies.<p><a href=""http://chestofbooks.com/finance/banking/Money-And-Banking-Holdsworth/images/Three-column-Ledger.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chestofbooks.com/finance/banking/Money-And-Banking-Ho...</a>",1346898400

4482531,comment,4481115,4481737,2,0,bane,,,"I think there's a difference between making software that looks pseudo-physical like Aqua, skeuomorphic like iCal, and mimicry like all those digital representations of a business ""desktop"", complete with 3d in and out box and useless paperclip holder...and I think that these things lie on a continuum.<p>For example, an audio recording app might start with a simple default OS ""record"" and ""playback"" buttons. Add shadows on the buttons and brushed aluminum for the window dressing and just look pseudo-physical, start adding 70s era cheap plastic looking knobs and you rapidly slide into skeuomorphic, keep going and next thing you know you hit Apple's podcast app, a little more and you go full Microsoft Bob and make you drag a virtual tape from one reel to another, through all of the various other windy rotating bits that are present in an actual reel-to-reel tape machine.<p>Skeuomorphism works when it <i>dresses up</i> a boring interface that's more or less feature complete. It might even go so far as to evoke the feeling of a familiar real-life object...paying it homage rather than mimicking it.<p>What doesn't work is when you rely on mimicry in an application to guide the user into the digital world from the physical one by employing a similar looking usage pattern. It sounds counter-intuitive, but it's true...why? One person's familiar metaphor may be completely outside of another person's experience. Take your example, Electric Checkbook, many people under 30 have probably never even written a check, or balanced a checkbook! I'm over 30, and I don't think I've ever even finished off an entire book of checks in my entire life! It's just a metaphor that no longer has relevance. I do lots of banking, pay bills, mortgage, car payments, school loans, utilities, etc. But I simply have never needed to use physical checks in anything but the rarest circumstances. For people in their 20s, they may have never actually even seen a physical check! The app may as well be designed around sectioning 8ths of Gold Doubloons and measuring out gold on a balance scale for all the relevance it has to new users!<p>Similarly, iCal looks like no timekeeping/scheduling object I've seen outside of professional offices of very senior executives and lawyers. Most people just <i>don't</i> use leatherbound desk calendars anymore. It doesn't evoke familiarity or nostalgia because it's simply entirely outside of most people's personal experience. Where iCal gets away with it is that it's fortunate that other calendar apps that computer users have become conditioned to over the decades <i>are</i> skeuomorphic in the sense that their design and layout are very much in-line with the layout of physical calendars anyways. But there is no reason a calendar can't be laid out in a wheel, or a list, or some other interface paradigm, and made to look like it was scratched into copper or some such and just been pseudo-physical.<p>The reel-to-reel ""Podcasts"" similarly tries to evoke some kind of nostalgia factor, listening to authoritative news reports on a vintage tape machine, without stopping to figure that most users have probably never even seen a ""real"" reel-to-reel. It's not skeuomorphic, it's Bob. It's so bad that the builders of the app didn't even bother building in the necessary functionality into the software before blasting faux-nostalgia vomit all over the design. At least I don't have to run the tape to setup the playback.<p>More importantly, design that's on the Bob side of skeuomorphic design almost always fails to scale. A bookshelf metaphor is fine because it's close enough to a basic grid of book covers, with a little wood veneer on it when a library has a few dozen titles in it. It blows up when you start having thousands and spend minutes scrolling through shelves trying to find your title, when a simple alphabetized list would have performed the function better. (The Bob way to solve the problem would be to organize your titles by the Dewey Decimal System, then give you a virtual card catalog, complete with little drawers full of little faded cards you have to comb through...and again this would present a physical metaphor for an experience completely outside of most people's modern experience in the last 20-30 years).",1346897586

4482513,comment,4478844,4482186,1,0,thebigpicture,,,"Sorry if I came across the wrong way.  It's just that I find the ""replace program x"" idea to be counterproductive.  It makes it far too easy to dismiss everything.<p>Maybe the goal is not to ""replace"" Skype (that would probably imply duplicating all its features, right?) but to offer alternatives for doing some, maybe even all, maybe even more than you can currently do using Skype.<p>We cannot just assume that everyone wants to replace other programs/solutions whenever they offer an alternative.  It may just be additive.<p>You have given an example: You use many different networks for different things.  None of them are exclusive.  You can use them all if you like.<p>It might be easier to get uptake of something ""new"" (and nurture that infamous ""network effect"") if it is not framed as ""replacement for enormously popular program x that users already know how to use and which works good enough"".<p>Does that make sense?<p>If I have a cool alternative OS to share with HN, how far do you think I will get if I frame it as a ""replacement for iOS/OSX/Linux""?  Not very far.  The problem is that even if you do not explicitly claim it is a replacement for anything, HN'ers still assume that's what you are implying by even mentioning it.<p>This is nuts.  If someone offers me an OS/program/solution that can do something I can't currently do with the existing OS/programs/solutions I use, I'm not going to disregard it simply because it duplicates some of the functionality of those programs.<p>I don't automatically think of the choice as ""either-or"", I think of it as ""should I add this to my options"".  I ask what can this offer me?  Can I split out the functionality in this program that I cannot get in existing programs?  But I know many users do view things as either-or.  It would be foolish to ignore that.  ""You can never replace program x.""  OK, we hear you.<p>This is why I like small programs that only do one thing.  If the user is going to view your using your program as an ""either-or"" decision (it must _replace_ what they currently use) instead of a ""can I use this in addition to what I'm already using"" decision, then the chances of deciding not to try your program are significantly increased if your program is some sort of do-everything whiz-bang solution.  That's because when you offer so many features, some of those the user is already getting from other existing OS/programs/solutions.  They are effectively forced to see things as either-or.<p>What if, e.g., someone offered just the NAT traversal function of Skype, and someone else offered an encryption program, and yet someone else offered a simple open source command line client (e.g. built with pjsip) that developers could write their own GUI's for?  None of them would be trying to ""replace"" Skype, but using those programs in combination, you could indeed construct a Skype alternative.  You might actually be able to do more than Skype can do because it would be a more flexible system.  As it stands, you are stuck with that Skype UI.  And you're stuck with Microsoft.  But if you had an open source command line client that anyone could write a GUI for... and solutions to traversing NAT... and solutions for keeping third parties from tampering/intercepting/eavesdropping...",1346897285

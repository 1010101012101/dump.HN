E.g. typically half or less of the S3 costs for triply redundant servers, on RAID arrays, in separate data-centres with replication (e.g. using OpenStack Swift, or Gluster / Ceph + an API layer for example)<p>For larger setups you can do it at 1/3 or less of the cost if you&#x27;re prepared to go the colo route (rather than managed servers) and leasing your own hardware.<p>If your average bandwidth usage per object is high you can trivially cut costs far beyond that, as the EC2/S3 bandwidth costs are atrocious.<p>The exception would be if you can&#x27;t avoid huge amount of object accesses from within EC2 even if you move the storage out of S3.",1421935076

Just two years ago everyone I knew was using WhatsApp, and what happened now? Most people use either Viber or Telegram, because uploading/downloading pics on WhatsApp takes forever.<p>WhatsApp had a POTENTIALLY massive commercial use here and they blew it with paid subscriptions (which people in my country can&#x27;t pay through Apple/Google stores). So people started switching their mobile numbers to get back into WhatsApp, which actually was really bad for WhatsApp but they blindly saw that as success. Their growth team probably said: &quot;We are killing it because more and more people are signing up!&quot; Yeah, but what&#x27;s the churn rate? It&#x27;s probably huge as well. These unique mobile users that they counted were actually the same people who couldn&#x27;t find a way to pay.<p>Ok, so if anyone from Whatsapp happened to read my post, here is how you can make (or could have made) money:\n- Charge businesses to communicate with their clients through WhatsApp. This is very straightforward -- businesses need A MAC/PC CLIENT for their team to talk to customers. I know our tech company wanted it, but you wouldn&#x27;t let third party clients exist. So we sticked with Viber and Telegram. Luckily regular users also ditched WhatsApp.<p>And look, we were not the only ones who needed it. The guy selling shoes/clothes would show products through WhatsApp. The local florist would show what he had available on particular day through pics on WhatsApp. Then he got tired of sending these pics to everyone, so he wanted to have these pics in his profile page. So who offered multiple pics in the profile? Telegram did. As much as I hated their deceptive claim about &quot;being the most secure app&quot;, they actually managed to listen to users.",1421934102

Significant equity aligns your outcomes and interests and gives you a seat at the table when liquidity events are going down.<p>Significance is more of a sliding  ratio. 0.5% is significant if the founders each have 6%. 10% is significant if they have about 25%. There should be only one qualitative step between stakes, and that step should reflect the size of the company.<p>A final tell on significance is if the ownership structure is relevant to the discussion. Significant equity alters it in a...wait for it...significant way. It signifies that the offer is about more than a hiring decision.

Very few words that describe absolutes can be used &quot;correctly&quot; in practice. The logical conclusion is that these words (despite their dictionary definition) don&#x27;t refer to actual absolutes but rather extremes: silence is not the <i>absence</i> of noise, it&#x27;s just the presence of a <i>significantly smaller amount</i> of noise.<p>Heck, even words like &quot;pregnant&quot; aren&#x27;t absolute in practice. With &quot;pregnant&quot; the implication commonly is &quot;will give birth&quot; (which is why we have euphemisms like &quot;expecting&quot;), so someone who is nearly due can be said to be &quot;more pregnant&quot; simply because they are closer to giving birth (and therefore also have a higher chance of delivering successfully) whereas someone within their first months of pregnancy may often not even want to disclose their state because so many things can still go wrong.<p>In practice &quot;silent&quot; or &quot;black&quot; is no more absolute than &quot;cold&quot; -- and it would be silly to expect people to refer to zero kelvin when they say &quot;cold&quot;, don&#x27;t you think?<p>Disclosure: I spent way too much time around linguists as a student.",1421932941

I think that means the software is allowed to be a kludged together bundle of scripts so long as it&#x27;s novel and can have papers written about it.  (We all do this kind of thing sometimes, but have usually either set it aside, or turned it into a production system.  It&#x27;s been rare to write a paper about it.)<p>4.

But that is LOOP on steroids. LOOP is surprisingly practical. ITERATE is even more practical and has more parentheses. ;-) But since LOOP is there, it&#x27;s good enough for a lot of purposes...<p>There are several objections against LOOP:<p>* another language. Don&#x27;t use Common Lisp is embedded languages are a problem. ;-)<p>* the syntax. Okay.<p>* Spec is not good enough. For me it is good enough.<p>* Not enough parentheses -> ITERATE.<p>* non-extensible ->  LOOP variants or ITERATE<p>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of stuff when it comes to loops and iterations.<p>Bad: tail recursion. Worse: RECUR in Clojure. Both lead to hard to maintain and hard to read code. I&#x27;ve one believes in Functional Programming, it might look attractive. But I don&#x27;t buy that. Having read and refactored a lot of these constructs, I find them hard to maintain.<p>LOOP: very useful in many cases.<p>Series: hard to extend<p>ITERATE: cool, everything I want.<p>Btw., LOOP comes from Interlisp from the 70s and was called FOR. The idea was to have english-like embedded languages. It was then moved and extended to Maclisp, and from there to Lisp Machine Lisp and then Common Lisp.",1421931761

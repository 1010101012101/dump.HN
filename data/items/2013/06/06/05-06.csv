The current political atmosphere, where the government is considered trustworthy until proven otherwise, is a result of Reconstruction and the two world wars that followed. Before that, it was a very real possibility that the newly founded United States might soon devolve into the kind of tyranny that the Founding Fathers perceived British rule to be. The Constitution was an attempt to prevent this from happening. By default, the government could not be trusted; and trust was only granted reluctantly when the government could demonstrate that it was doing the right thing. That's why so many clauses of the Constitution are concerned with what the government <i>can't</i> do. The government was never supposed to enjoy as much blind trust as it does today.",1370498219

Those who one expects to know, respect and defend it are the ones chipping away at its edges, bit by bit.<p>This leads to trust issues. It is like entrusting someone with a job, and then they find a way to screw it up then come back and say technically I didn't do anything wrong because ""I followed all the rules"". Yes they followed all the rules, but they also managed to lose the trust. Now the relationship is adversarial as opposed to one of mutual support.<p>Now I always wondered about the peons. They ones working in the trenches who have implemented all these technical ""features"" . One or two have come out and revealed it. What about others?

Young girls can be cruel.\nSuicide was always in my mind from 15 to about 25. But it is not a dreadful feeling, in fact at that times, it can be very liberating. \nTo think everything has a very simple solution, I saw death like the end of suffering and the beginning of peace, whats not to love about that? Suicide thoughts always comforted me in those sad moments, like a pressure valve. Nothing can be so bad that death is not a fix for it.<p>But its easier to think about it than to do it, that's for sure. Something changed in my mind about the time I had 30. Never had those feelings again. But I always will remember the times I contemplated death as moments of hope in between desperation.",1370495656

For this it's best to canvas other people but make sure the conclusions are your own and not blamed on others. Focus on causes that are not people but processes/structures that have et the organisation up to fail.<p>3: Your recommendations for the senior exec/board etc. Again I would give tangible things they can do that do not involve individuals, such as immediately de-scope the project, bring in certain external help, separate out this department and that and so on.<p>If they are smart they will meet with you, and even keep you on in a role where you can help make changes.

223565,comment,223499,223534,0,0,tx,,,"PDFs are very nice on Gnome too. The default reader is super-fast and PDFs really feel like nicely formatted text files. PDF simply rocks.<p>Why, oh why, don't they convert everything into PDFs or (better) HTML?!<p>Scribd is solving a real problem which <i>exists</i> but their approach is the most perverted way imaginable... View your docs... through a FLASH PLUGIN! Even converting them into high-res JPEGs would have been alot better.",1214034886
223564,comment,223512,223530,0,0,rtf,,,"I've studied the ideas around Subtext for a while. It's worth reiterating(if the videos and papers don't make it clear enough) that Subtext is really focused on exploiting the benefits of decision tables by expanding upon them and adding the complete set of constructs in addition to logic.<p>Decision tables, by the way, _work_. If you haven't tried them, it will only take a brief perusal of Wikipedia to get the concept. Their benefit is that all logic is represented in a single table: if every entry in the table has been filled, all cases are covered. Much easier to read than linear code, much less prone to error.<p>You can write your own decision table by hand in a spreadsheet program. But above a certain level of complexity(the point where you really, really want correct logic the first time) a complete decision table becomes very time-consuming to write by hand. By design it will still give more correct results than just hacking away, but automated approaches become very appealing. Decision tables were researched for a while in the 60s and early 70s, but were abandoned presumably as the field moved on to more prestigious topics.<p>Subtext's so-called ""schematic table"" does much to add the necessary automation - the next step in making it production-worthy would be to port such a system to output code in existing languages.",1214034433

223560,comment,222746,222878,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"The main issue here is I don't <i>want</i> a compromise in my shower. Not for hygienic reasons, that's a practical matter and can be addressed as such, but because hot baths/showers are a mark of civilization, of the fact that we live in the environment we choose.<p>The transportation problem at least can be solved. Besides public transportation I think one solution would be to think local more. When hiring somebody I'm factoring in their commute time - it influences a lot of their long term job satisfaction.",1214034170

Now it's moving increasingly towards shallow analysis of tech news. It's just less interesting. Nasty, sniping submissions like the OP are the next step. It's only a few more 'till lolcats.",1214034124

Although not yet implemented, it should be possible to do everything from the keyboard.""",1214033770
223553,comment,222746,222746,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Very much agree with the order of magnitude argument. I never understood all this economic lighting fad: i use economical light bulbs because they save me money, not because they save the planet. Everything I save this way is probably less then one brake of a freight train.<p>What irritates me more is how much we allow people to push their irrational arguments over us and let them dominate the discussion. I strongly doubt Greenpeace hasn't made the same math, they just don't care. And still they can make someone be afraid to be labeled as pro-nuclear. Why? Why do we allow obvious flawed theories be pushed around until they become common sense?",1214033625

Firefox does have the edge on Safari in terms of features.<p>I guess the equivalent in Safari would be to cmd+f, type your word or phrase, press escape, then press enter.  A couple extra steps but it does the trick.",1214033223

Неудивительно, что HackerNews, построенный примерно тех же принципах (карма, ранжирование), создает чувство deja vu.<p>Тем не менее, будет здорово, если там объявятся не только любители поговорить, но и те, кто реально прочитает документацию к MTProto.</i><p>Which roughly translates to:<p><i>I remember the first reviews of VK back in 2006. The experts were saying &quot;who are they?&quot;, &quot;we don&#x27;t need another social network&quot;, &quot;only noobs write in php&quot;.

6946725,comment,6945920,6946551,3,0,tseabrooks,,,"It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than this. I think you start hitting on the reality towards the end but get detoured by racism in the beginning.<p>It&#x27;s all about tribal identification. I don&#x27;t mean tribes in the historical sense but more akin to Godin&#x27;s idea of tribes. They&#x27;re the people you identify with. It&#x27;s pretty well established that people like people like themselves. This isn&#x27;t really that crazy. It&#x27;s easy to see that liking people like yourself isn&#x27;t the same as hating people that are different, it does often mean you don&#x27;t respond as warmly though.<p>Names, just like race, is just one marker, as you described it, that defines what tribe we belong to. We are all in the business of quickly assessing the situation and placing people into tribes mentally, probably unconsciously, as soon as we meet them and we will adjust our perception as we learn more about them, of course.<p>The point of these rambling paragraphs is that I don&#x27;t think  this is the same as racism, though it certainly can become racism when taken to the extreme. A good example is our friend groups. If we like a certain music, a certain type of game (DnD) then you&#x27;re likely to end up in a friend group with a very similar set of interests.<p>This gets expanded to the work place in an interesting way. Lots of hip trendy employers say things like, &quot;We wanted to build a company we loved coming to everyday&quot;. Well, in order to love being at the office every day you&#x27;re going to have to like the people. Does this mean they have to be perfect matches for someone you&#x27;d place in your friend group, in your tribe? No. But it does mean they&#x27;re going to have to match on some of those markers.<p>Companies talk about &quot;cultural fit&quot; when hiring, hell it&#x27;s on the front page here pretty regularly. In my estimation this isn&#x27;t that far from not hiring people based on race. Instead we&#x27;re not hiring based on some other set of <i>markers</i> other than race. What we&#x27;re really talking about is <i>cultural-ism</i> where we discriminate based on particular subcultures, and markers for those subcultures.<p>I won&#x27;t argue fairness or anything like that but I do think it&#x27;s important to explore the ideas that we discriminate against people regularly and only ascribe malice when it&#x27;s down for racial reasons.<p>(Not that it should matter but I&#x27;m black and I run a team of about 16 people (all white) doing sales/product management/project management/ software development in the South)",1387636149

I have employed these concepts on a dozen or so SaaS products, and the resulting schemes have have worked extremely well, and have been rock-solid frames to work from.<p>However... I think there&#x27;s a risk in adopting these types of models without having some experienced context in them.  Software design has a huge amount of &#x27;art&#x27; to it.  And, it&#x27;s so easy to reach the complexity tipping point - where it all come crashing down.  For instance, I remember back in the mid-90s when the design patterns book was all the rage.  And, shortly thereafter I&#x27;d find code just jam-packed with factories and builders and observers and adapters in multiple layers.  It was a mess.  Similarly, I can see someone reading these and then going out and creating a &#x27;devices&#x27; namespace, a &#x27;controllers&#x27; namespace, etc.  and filling them with all too many classes and interfaces.  I can even predict the rise of the &#x27;framework&#x27; maven archetype that creates a bunch of extraneous excess.<p>Listen, I&#x27;ve been there and done that, and it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  It just creates a lot of architectural noise.  It creates a mess for your development teams.  I&#x27;ve learned this the hard way.  Trust me.<p>What I recommend is starting very, very slowly.  Just like when DI was the rage, and everyone would leap to integrate the most popular DI engine with all its xml configuration files and heavy weight complexity.  When, in fact, all you really need at first is a couple of interfaces and a builder class in the entry-point.  Don&#x27;t set out to create an architectural behemoth.<p>That said, I still think a solid &#x27;domain model&#x27; should be at the core of it all.  If anything, spend a lot of time defining the domain.  Work with stakeholders (product managers, subject matter experts, managers, field and support, even developers, etc.) to get it down.  Write unit tests that help make the domain very fluent.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to have a small core of very well defined domain classes, then trying to boil the ocean.  Start small and focus on the quality of the entities.<p>Again, this is just from my trial-by-many-errors experiences.",1387635630

Produce of those estates will be given to employees on subsidized rates. The better performer you are, the more mangoes you get. The employees just get to drool.<p>2)Zoho was earlier called AdventNet. To save tax, and also to chuck the original founders out, they have renamed it to Zoho. I guess there isn't any debris available of AdventNet anywhere (except in the package names of the java exceptions their products throw).<p>3) Free lunch - You will get free lunch everyday at Zoho. It means a lot to the poor school students they recruit. And last year, there was an Iphone/Ipad choice too. You need these freebies to get people glued in and forget the meager salary they get.<p>4) Criticize Criticize Criticize - \nCriticize your degree - Never mind it came from Princeton. That way you charm your fellow employees who then feels that their school leaving certificate is enough. You cite examples of Steve Jobs and Bill Gate and voila.<p>Criticize your competitor (the original topic here) - Never mind what they innovated. That gives you some press coverage and publicity.<p>5) Family and Family rules - All of Sridhar's family is in this business, though none of the others have got his charisma. This has lead to the stagnation of other employees reaching the top. This is the secret behind they not advertising themselves. As the orginal founders have been chucked out, they know that this will lead to some conflict of interest.",1370591288

If we can pick up signals from distant galaxies can we not make our own special network out of those thousands of desktops running those powerful computer chips today?<p>Problem: If someone at intel/MS directly works with us, we will be found out.<p>Solution: Let's target a high level exec, he wont do anything other than allow them to employ a few of our special programmers.<p><pre><code>   Take the chip plans from Intel. Make some modifications to add another core, which is activated in a special mode and instruction running its own Operating System/wifi etc.\n\n  Deployment: Tell the high level exec, tell us when your next upgrade to manufacturing hardware will arrive.

I honestly think 99.99% of the people at the NSA and in the Executive branch are vacuuming up that data out of a sincere desire to keep America safe, too. But only members of Congress enjoy the legal immunities of the 'speech or debate' clause; they're invested with the rare power to exercise their conscience in how they fulfill their oaths of office, unlike most of the executive branch.",1370589185
5837677,comment,5835432,5836031,2,0,AJ007,,,"I don't know what Congress's level of approval is. Here are the specific issues that should concern everyone irregardless of what their approval or disapproval of this behavior is:<p>#1 The existence of the spying is top secret. This isn't surveillance of a suspected serial killer or corrupt Governor. The only reason for this to be secret is fear of political backlash.<p>#2 The secrecy is protected and enforced by law. However this was leaked, if identified the individual(s) involved will go to prison.<p>#3 This blanket secrecy is also being applied to elected members of \nCongress. How can something be opposed if its existence is secret, as protected by law?<p>I am coming to grips with the issue that there may be no turning back on the mass surveillance state. While we may be capable of barricading certain activities from surveillance, others have become integrated in to the operation of every day life, likely irreversibly.<p>However we have a much more chilling problem when this surveillance, by the government, is a one way mirror. If the activity is secret and that secrecy is enforced through the punishment of imprisonment, all accountability is lost.<p>The NSA is not a branch of government, and yet it is in effect dictating what the other three branches of government must do. Congress, forced in to secrecy through law -- even if some support what is occurring dissenters can not voice their opinion, Executive, who even knows what is going on there, and Judicial, which serves as the secrecy enforcer.<p>I think the people in the crypto community just assumed the NSA was doing this decades ago. Now it is unquestionably reality. This must serve as a wake up call for us to <i>terminate</i> our relationships with Google, Facebook, and Microsoft and figure out how to provide blacked-out alternative services to our users.<p>If not, in 5 years, every single waking moment of your life will be available electronically and in perpetuity. No matter what happens most of it will be, which makes it ever more important that the protect-able segments are not.<p>Up until now cryptography & privacy have been very poorly marketed. There are polished solutions such as Silent Circle, but for $240+ a year it provides little to offer for mass adaptation. Email, instant messaging, and video conferencing all have a wide array of solutions and plugins, but between manual configuration and out of date code, the marketing is on par with programmer drawn graphics in video games.<p>Snapchat may offer little more than faux privacy, but its mass adaption proves that there is a huge market for privacy. \nThere are promising projects, like Crypton.io, which enable the use of cryptography in cloud applications. You, HN readers, have more influence on the direction of these things than anyone else in the entire world. Your start ups will determine what 5 years from now look like.<p>Make Privacy a Feature and its a win-win for both business and individual rights.",1370589150

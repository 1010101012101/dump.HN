The user needs to feel that their community is safe and regulated by ethics similar to their own. A few public debacles involving said user auctions could seriously damage a sites reputation and adversely effect its presence in general.  It would be much safer to build in the transactional side of the operation. This wouldn't have to be a ground up operation either, partnerships that would allow a site to reface existing transactional portals would be ideal. For example take a social network of bibliophiles. This example site has a strong sticky content with syndicated book critics and authors along with established ""user2user"" interactivity. The site then works out a deal with amazon that allows the biblio-site access to the amazon backend for placement and fulfillment of orders for a piece of orders driven from their site. To the book loving user the process seems seamless. This way the site reduces exposure to risk due to bad public sentiment of their intentions and operating procedures.  ",1179128862

You are arguably correct that turning down an offer with reasonable terms would indicate a low IQ, but its also a personality litmus. I don't see how after completing the necessary steps to even get in a position where they could even entertain the idea of accepting an offer they would turn it down. Especially considering that the general structure of the offer is already a known factor before they even walk in the door. So IQ couldn't be the only determining factor, in fact it can't even really be on the plate. Verily, denying a YC offer should be a DSM-IV criterion for a major psychosis.</i><p>With a nod to ecuzzillo - They're just crazy.      ",1179127552

And, the return on the schlep is nonlinear in the size of the schlep; it's more like exponential, assuming you keep winning your rolls of the dice. And, the n+1th roll of the dice has a much higher expectation than the nth. In other words, they've come all this way, and they're ALMOST at fuck-you money-- they wouldn't want to come back 20 years later and go through the whole process again. ",1179127482

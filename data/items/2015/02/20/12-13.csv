9080212,comment,9078932,9079781,0,0,alasdairnicol,,,"> If an expensive laptop breaks after 4 years, then you can argue it wasn&#x27;t fit for purpose and therefore must be fixed or replaced (or a full refund issued). As long as you haven&#x27;t caused the problem through misuse, you&#x27;re covered.<p>My understanding is that under the Sale of Goods Act you are entitled to a partial refund [1], which reflects the use that you got out of the product. For example, if a laptop broke after 4 years, and 6 years was a reasonable lifespan, that suggests a 1/3 refund.<p>I believe that the new EU directive entitles you for a full refund for the 2 years of the warranty. In this regard, it&#x27;s a stronger protection than the UK Sale of Goods act. In other regards, the Sale of Goods act is stronger (5 years to make a claim in Scotland, 6 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).<p>> Unless you&#x27;d bought it from another person rather than a business, you should have received the same treatment. This isn&#x27;t Apple being nice, this is them fulfilling their legal obligations.<p>Some retailers might be quicker to fulfil their obligations than others, so that&#x27;s worth considering when choosing where to buy the product. My recent experience at the Apple store after buying from the Apple website was pretty positive.<p>edit: re-reading your post, I realise that you already pointed out that your rights are against the retailer, not the manufacturer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-goods-act#link-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-go...</a>",1424437178

This is the solid foundation that I mentioned my OP. This is even closer than a shogi 9-dan becoming a chess master at 30.<p>- Dave McClure: hit lottery(even if you argue it was skill, it has nothing to do with my hypothesis) with Paypal, after that he has bought a lot (500+) of lottery tickets. Nothing wrong with that but I do not see mastery (ala Buffett) VC is a field where it is hard to measure mastery. I suppose one could take 10 year risk adjusted returns as some measure. Again, you can start doing anything at any age, but do not expect any great results.<p>- Fauja Singh: &quot;As a young man, Fauja was an avid amateur runner, but he gave it up at the time of the 1947 India-Pakistan Partition.&quot; His records ar 90+ are fantastic for a 90 year old and probably 70-80 year olds but no more than that.<p>- Joseph Conrad , writers in general are a tricky to evaluate as most of us have had &quot;some&quot; writing in teenage years. Surely, Conrad wrote in Polish and French in his teen years.<p>One of my favorite writers Raymond Chandler did not really become a writer until age of 44, so does he disprove my hypothesis? If you look at his bio, he must have  written/dictated quite a bit as an oil executive sober or not. Even more importantly he was a reporter for the Daily Express and the Bristol Western Gazette newspapers in his 20s.<p>- Stallone: nothing unusual in his career, he might have started acting a few years later than most aspiring Hollywood hopefuls. His success with Rocky does not really dis/prove his mastery of acting. He is decent at his craft.<p>- Ben Larcombe&#x27;s table tennis experiment: his subject was his friend 24 year old Sam Priestley. Again this falls within my 25 year old rule. Besides that the experiment failed!<p>Actually I agree with most of the conclusions that Ben Larcombe reached: <a href=""http://www.experttabletennis.com/possible-master-table-tennis-12-months/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.experttabletennis.com/possible-master-table-tenni...</a><p>However again, age is a harsh mistress and past 40 the decline in your learning ability becomes noticable.<p>We all need our delusions and the &quot;I can do anything if only I set my mind to it&quot; is quite a common one.",1424436867

I paid in bitcoins because it was $3 or $4 so I simply didn&#x27;t care if the VPS provider didn&#x27;t deliver (submitting a chargeback request for such a low amount is not worth my time)<p>If this is a real use case (and frankly how often do you want to pay for something that you don&#x27;t care whether you&#x27;ll actually get?) you can buy a prepaid credit card (over the internet, from a reputable provider, using your normal credit card) and use that.

I suspect there&#x27;s just very little demand for it.<p>> I didn&#x27;t fully trust the merchant with my credit card info (how securely do they protect/encrypt it? could they be hacked? etc).<p>Your bank covers you if they are though.<p>> You completely avoided the main point of my example #3.<p>If people use bitcoin then people will use bitcoin sure. But that applies to any tradeable object. If enough people start giving each other baseball cards at christmas then people will start paying with baseball cards. What&#x27;s the specific advantage that would make people want to give bitcoin?<p>> your cute story doesn&#x27;t mean credit card fraud is a solved problem. In many cases the customer has NO RECOURSE for fraud. For example you cannot chargeback a transaction made more than 60 days ago. Some fraudulent merchants pretend to act legitimately but stall shipping (eg. claim delays, issues, etc) for 60 days specifically to exploit this fact<p>Most reputable card issuers will cover you for longer than the contract says. And even if not, 60 days of cover is still much better than the 0 days you get with bitcoin.<p>> Or if your PIN code is stolen and a fraudulent transaction is made with the PIN code, you will typically be held liable<p>Again, you&#x27;re contractually liable but in practice reputable banks cover you at least the first time. Whereas if your bitcoin private keys are stolen, the money is gone and you&#x27;ll never get it back.<p>> Give your money to a fraudster and he will run away with it, no matter if its bitcoins or dollars.<p>What&#x27;s the non-fraudster option with bitcoin?

I'm not immediately sure what use of ""median household"" vs. ""median individual"" means, since I'm not sure what counts as a household.

Beyond the fact that it is pretty much dead today, was firesaled, and was had some nasty interpersonal personnel issues,  I think it is a classic example of a company with a unmanageable story:<p>""Here's how it works: we convince people to write opinions.  And then when someone else reads that opinion, and ranks it highly, we'll give the writer a piece of an affiliate link sale.""<p>There's way, way, way too many steps involved in making a few pennies.<p>The story that you tell your users (all of them) is very important.  Epinion's was pretty miserable.<p>A buddy of mine said that one of the reasons that Google's a money machine is that it is dead easy for a neophyte web advertiser to set up an ad:<p>1.

Of course, this was implemented through regulation, but I wonder what you could do on an open market.  Would it be feasible for consumers to buy into a local fiber network so that they ""own"" the last mile?

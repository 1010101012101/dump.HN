5440506,comment,5439521,5440457,1,0,funkymusic,,,"> Can you travel in and out of the US as often as you want while on this visa?<p>Yes<p>> What would be the standard criteria for having the visa renewal approved? Would they need to see revenue growth? Would a stable stream of revenue be sufficient?<p>You provide them with a forecast and the idea is to meet the goals or show some progress on the project I guess (employees, paying taxes etc) - can tell you more in 2yrs :)<p>> Can you start other companies while on this visa?<p>Sure but the visa is connected to the company you made the investment in.<p>> Can you invest in other companies on this visa?<p>Think so, why not. If you invest in US companies as an individual the nationality does not really matter (e.g. we're raising under a convertible note from non-US investors).<p>> If you have existing employees from non-treaty countries, can they come?<p>Not sure but I guess you have to look for alternatives like H-1B.<p>> While on the visa, can you hire new employees from your home country and get them visas?<p>Not 100% sure but it should work; as far as I have heard the visa can be extended to other people employed in the company.",1364255961

5440477,comment,5435966,5439913,1,0,robomartin,,,"Let's just disagree.  I really don't see it your way.  Businesses didn't just setup websites.  The entirety of the modern internet (and web) in most countries was built privately.  You would not enjoy a DSL connection today without quite literally fortunes having been put on the line to develop, install, run and sell the infrastructure.<p>My key point is that, if we are talking CERN and the WWW, this was not, in any way a program that originated by any one government.  It was scientists trying to solve a problem.  No politician devised, specified, directed, funded and pushed for the development of the WWW at CERN.  It just happened because they were trying to improve the way they communicated with each other.<p>To me when someone say something akin to ""the public sector created the WWW"" or ""the/a government created the WWW"" it means something very different than scientist at a research organization who were trying to fix some problems and happen to create something that went big.  For me to attribute anything to government it must have clear genesis in government.<p>A perfect example of this is Obama-care.  There is no imaginable way to claim that Obama-care was created by the private sector.  It is a clear case of something that was created by a government and handed down to us.<p>Claiming that the WWW was a public sector project, a government project or something we ought to hold-up high as an example of what central planning can create is --again, my opinion-- absurd. It's like saying Linux is a centrally-planned public sector/government project because so many of the early contributors were in government-funded academic institutions.  I could not envision anyone saying we owe Linux to our or any government.<p>In Tim Berners-Lee's own words:<p>""The WorldWideWeb (WWW) project aims to allow all links to be made to any information anywhere. [...] The WWW project was started to allow high energy physicists to share data, news, and documentation. We are very interested in spreading the web to other areas, and having gateway servers for other data. Collaborators welcome!""<p>Yes, the European Commission and other public and private entities (MIT) would join forces later on to nail down protocols and such things in order to make ensure interoperability.  Again, a natural effect.  In fact, you could have taken government entirely out of the picture and this standardization would have probably happened just the same as universities and research labs got together to make the system work more universally.  It's the story of computing.  There are many standards in a myriad of industries that were developed ad-hoc at first and later refined and ratified by key commercial and non-commercial players in the industry.<p>The history of the Internet --as distinct from the WWW which one could think of as an application that runs on top of the Internet-- is a little more convoluted.  Depending on how you want to interpret things it took thirty to forty years for the Internet to surface from inception in 1960/1970 in a form that enabled the WWW to be developed.<p>The primary motivator and driver for ARPANET had nothing whatsoever to do with us being able to buy books online.  It was a purely military project from the start that mutated into civilian use at one point.  No consumer-side foresight existed in its development at all.  That's why it is a bit disingenuous to credit the US government with the creation of what we call the Internet today.<p>Much like civilian aviation had its roots in military aviation, the roots of what we call the Internet today are in military technology.<p>It would be insane to say that the government, in a centrally-planned sort of way, invented civilian aviation.  Just the same, I don't think it is fair to credit government or the public sector with the creation and development of the modern civilian Internet.  These are vastly different things.<p>The scary proposition here is that we ought to support every military initiative because they might develop into amazingly useful civilian projects in the future.  I fundamentally reject the idea that we have to continually develop better killing tools in order to derive peace-time benefits.<p>I could be wrong.<p>The Wikipedia page on the history of the Internet is well worth reading:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet</a><p>So is this timeline:<p><a href=""http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/</a>",1364255569

There are a lot of email clients already in the FOSS world and most of them are pretty good. Not perfect, sure, maybe lacking polish - of course. But they do their job and that's really all I want from email. (And for a lot of things - like conversations - I actively try keeping them OUT of email.)<p>They try kinda-sorta hard to pretend that I'm living in a dreary pit of begrudging acceptance using Thunderbird on Linux, but that only works if that's actually the case. It's not. Search could be a tad faster, conversation might be neat, sometimes, and there probably are exotic cases where you have dozens of imap accounts open that things get sluggish. None of these are killer features that sell me on this project because none of these are out of reach for the applications that already exist. (And again, as an actual user, I don't really care.)<p>The video was... confused. I think they realized that you do need to ""sell something"" when you do a fundraiser like this, but all they came up with were minor features that felt lukewarm - both in the technical sense and in the way they were presented. There is very little about what their passion point is in all this, except ""better"" and ""faster"" and... kinda more like gmail and mail.app. FOSS Projects usually start out with pain points that need to be addressed and with passionate people who care very, very deeply about them. I don't see that here.<p>The telltale is when the project lead goes for the ""we've come so far"". And then lists... conversation view, an html composer and connecting to multiple accounts. And then we arrive at the point where he almost starts explaining why they need our help. Where they want to go with this. What will make this so amazing in the future. Why <i>I</i> should feel passionate about it and for them. Why <i>I</i> should <i>want</i> to give them my money.<p>Nothing of that happens, he just stumbles into the final sentence. <i>Please donate to Yorba today</i>. And that's really all there is.<p>Finally, I don't really think lines like ""bring you software so good, you don't know it's Open Source"" (and a lot of further weird stuff in the same direction) is anything but carelessly smug. I'm not sure they have any idea whatsoever what kind of audience they're selling to.<p>Sorry guys, but this is not how FOSS works.

I joined a startup after college, got paid less than the minimum wage (no kind of equity in the company either) because I found out the financial situation of the company had been misrepresented to me by the co-founder, and I left with the work I hadn't been paid for as collateral (knowing they were going to let me work the month out and were unable and unwilling to pay me). I had my suspicions and I found this out by looking at their conversations on a forum on the server (which I had the root password to).<p>First thing they did was call the cops for ""computer hacking"". Cops laughed it off obviously. Then they went to their lawyer. They were desperate for money and thought they could exact revenge. Lawyers really know how to write scary letters and make it seem that you're in a world of trouble, I hope you're aware of that. Really what they're doing is trying to get you to reply to everything they throw at you, so that something can be used against you. They want an admission of guilt, and then they can force you to settle.<p>I sought free legal advice from a local charity, but they only operate once a month so I had to write back before then. I defended my actions and made allegations against them. Their response was always short, they would never address what I said to them, and they would always try to trip me up on what I said (poorly might I add, based on their poor understanding of technology). One lesson I learned from this is that nothing you say in those letters in your defence goes in your favour, it is only fodder that can be used against you.<p>The lawyer told me that when writing back to them I should put ""without prejudice"" on the letters, meaning the letter can't be used as evidence (this was not in the USA however!). Eventually I threw enough stuff at them about wages, their taxes and their activities, threatening to take them to the labour court, that I just stopped hearing from them. In the end they walked away with probably a $1500 bill from their lawyers and nothing to show for it. (good enough for them!)<p>In summary, don't panic, the lawyers are relying on you panicking. Get a lawyer. If you live in a sane country you can find a free one.",1364254981

We took too long to go live.<p>ProjectTF - a derivative market for daily t-shirts. Didn't work because we couldn't work out/secure a deal in the back end.<p>edgeyo - a marketplace for startups and entrepreneurs, kinda like a public secondmarket + angellist. We worked 3 years on this, but ultimately got to nowhere. A lot of effort was wasted on this. Too much burn out too. We took a break after this. ZOMBIE<p>SpellTrade - A novel auction for Magic the Gathering cards. Think of options exchange for MtG cards. This was at the height of Jace the Mind Sculptor. This one failed because we needed to bootstrap the market, and tried to talk a few LGSes into doing it. Everyone got the idea, but no LGS was willing to take the risk of holding magic card stock for options. This is an example of waste: we built everything in preparation for the LGSes to come on board (they were happy to come on board)<p>Strangers for Dinner - This was the first project since we killed edgeyo. Kinda liks zokos, but for dinner parties. Over 2000 people signed up. But planet Earth is really really really big.

I was paid a small sum to do some work, which I did. I delivered the work to contract, but when I did not want to do the additional work involved with actually setting all their stuff up and getting everything deployed, they sued. I didn't have the time or money to deal with it, so I ignored it all, they ended up getting a default judgement against me for double what I was originally paid. I just figured I wouldn't pay them, but they were lawyers so they got my wages garnished (25% of each paycheck). Paid my last part of the garnishment last week.<p>Don't worry about going pro se from a procedural standpoint - judges are quite accommodating (and frankly, amused) by those of us who choose to represent themselves. I did an exhaustive amount of research prior to trial, and the district attorneys were grossly under-prepared for the case, so I was able to easily put them to shame. Put time into your opening, closing, and preparing your witnesses (including yourself). Watch a few episodes of Law and Order. It actually ends up being a pretty awesome story, whichever way it turns out.<p>The whole situation is terrible, I've been there.

I've used it in several instances where there is more than one person handling DB upgrades and the like. You can have several panes/tabs open, vim with upgrade notes, and everyone connecting and working as needed. It beats the crap out of constant copying/pasting pieces of code and terminals on some IM program to make sure everyone sees what you're seeing.<p>I usually also end up running it locally and bypassing the terminal emulator and WM's multiplexing abilities, but it's more out of a desire to use the same tool whether I'm running locally or on some remote box. If you don't need the latter, it's a bit harder to justify using it, even though it still has some advantages, like generally being more scriptable.",1364252935

I assumed this was about kitchen knives when I clicked on the link.<p>The US constitution was written with a right to bear arms so people could <i>overthrow the government</i>, not protect themselves from criminals. Since then, that government has entrenched power to the point where it would be nearly impossible for even another state to take it down, let alone a group of armed civilians - thus rendering the constitutional clauses irrelevant to their original purpose. <i>(note to secret services: no, I don't want to overthrow governments or start wars, I'm talking hypothetically.)</i><p>In the rest of the developed world where weapons are generally banned, as they are in the UK, criminals simply <i>don't use weapons</i> on civilians (apart from high value targets, perhaps) because the penalties for doing so are so harsh. Criminals literally throw their guns away in a chase, rather than use them on the police/get caught with them. Police are generally unarmed, apart from specially trained units (dawn raids, at airports, etc).<p>This is the sole reason I would never <i>ever</i> consider living in the USA - the risk from a) criminals, b) civilian ""heros"" and c) the police themselves, all of whom are armed to the teeth, legally.

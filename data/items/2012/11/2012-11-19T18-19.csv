When a customer comes to you, rather than you going to them, and they've come to you <i>because</i> of something specific and awesome you've done or written, you can set your price and the customer will not balk.<p>Many years ago, I did consulting at $125/hour, but if I was going on-site (particular in another city), I'd bill by the day, at $1000/day (often putting in 10 hours a day, so $100/hour) with some sort of minimum in place, so I wouldn't drive or fly somewhere to only be needed for one day. The reason I could charge what I did was because I did some stuff that led to me being well-known. I wrote a book; it didn't sell very well, or pay me much, but when you say, ""I wrote a book about system administration, published by No Starch Press"" it raises you to the tier of people that can charge $125/hour without hesitation.<p>Also, when you have a long-running consultancy that specializes in one niche (mine was web caching, website acceleration, etc., though I also did good business in developer infrastructure, like building systems for packaging and testing and revision control, etc.), you'll have fewer customers, but they'll be customers who will value your skills. A jack of all trades, who is actually <i>really fucking good</i> at all trades, is incredibly valuable, but it's difficult to market that because it's difficult to prove you're really good at everything. Proving you're good in one field is just a matter of following the mailing lists and forums in your field, and being talkative and helpful, writing a blog about your subject, and eventually turning all that writing into a book or magazine articles or something.<p>Of course, I never took it to the next level, as this article discusses. I was still billing by the hour, and still being thought of as a (pretty high end, and difficult to find) commodity. So, I made a decent living, but it didn't scale.",1353351569

As far as I know, none of these successes pitched prior success with big businesses or their diploma.<p>This change in messaging lowers the risk factor between you and a potential client (throwing money at a coder doesn't always equate to business success), which in turn allows you to drive up your rates.",1353351534

They need to extend it to the phone.<p>Idea #1: Picture there being two WiFi networks on a plane: Internet Access and iMessage.

[yes, you could pay using GoGo etc from your mobile phone and do this, but few know about it and the UX stinks]<p>Idea #2: Flight trackers as a landing page are nice, but get companies to pay a buck or two to put their product or commercial on your connection page to further subsidize the cost. Picture even a Google/Facebook ad model where you could target your ad to the person's demographic based on their gender and DOB from their frequent flier number.<p>Idea #3: For the love of God please do a better job throttling and/or blocking bandwidth hogs until the tech is better.

4805694,comment,4804602,4805053,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is an interesting assertion. While it is true that Intel has great fabrication chops, their biggest competitor in that space, Samsung, makes ARM chips. There is an outside possibility that AMD gets into the ARM space, gets some traction and Samsung brings their manufacturing muscle to bear and captures the 'high' end.<p>It is interesting to understand the 'Intel monopoly' [1] and how it came to be. I worked at Intel in the mid-80's and basically IBM 'created' a personal computer market by bringing their reputation to the market, Microsoft provided the software, and rigid compatibility was demanded by the market to maximize software re-use (software and training has always been the biggest 'cost' of switching instruction set architectures). Early on Intel was cross licensing that 8086 architecture with partners to get market share against the 68000 architecture but later they clawed back a lot of the licenses.<p>The requirement that is be 'windows compatible' created a giant moat around the x86 instruction set architecture. That moat wasn't officially breached until the early 2000's when AMD announced their Sledgehammer (aka Opeteron) AMD64 architecture. Here was an architecture that was <i>not</i> Windows compatible (windows didn't <i>really</i> support 64 bit chips until Windows 7) and yet AMD managed some big design wins in servers because of Linux and OEMs who could adapt quickly to the new extensions. Intel finally caved and shipped the AMD extensions in their own chips, even though they knew it was probably the end of the Itanium as a viable product.<p>Now AMD announces an ARM server chip, they have some expectation that it will gain some market share because they did it with Opteron. They are even calling it an Opteron perhaps as a nod to that history. They will be able to innovate in the peripheral chips because all off the 'bets' are off in terms of what has to be in the 'south bridge'. They can do more creative memory interconnects because they aren't constrained by folks expecting the Intel stuff.<p>And here is the interesting thing, there are easily 10x the ARM licensees than the x86 licensees. That pretty much guarantees a lot of competition and price pressure.<p>The strategic questions are these:<p>Can AMD establish a 'server' standard? Something like the PC spec but for ARM chips, a minimum set of things that will always be there and a way to find out what optional things are there. This enables shipping a generic kernel that boots on everything and customizes itself to the environment.<p>Can AMD survive the ingress of a number of other players earlier in the life cycle rather than later. If they are getting traction expect competitive chips in 12 months rather than 24 or 36 months.<p>What is Intel's ""Thermonuclear war"" strategy and would they be willing to pull that trigger. Unlike Apple's Android antagonists, AMD is not well positioned to survive a huge litigation punch.<p>We'll see of course, the game is afoot as Sherlock Holmes would say. I'm hopeful that we crack this thing open and start innovating again.",1353350203

And it's true that to do this, consultants have to think about the actual business context of their code, and be able to confidently propose the value of that code to a real business.<p>But that's where the differences end! Patrick is writing code on his engagements. He's using the same problem-solving methods you're using. On a day-to-day basis actually delivering for clients, he's writing code to generic metrics and then optimize them. The only thing he does differently from you is that he chooses to work on metrics where he knows he can make a case for revenue directly attributable to the metric.<p>It does <i>not</i> take a ""big business win"" or an Ivy education (WAT?) to ""consult"" for clients as opposed to ""contracting"" for them. You don't even have to be particularly attentive to your clients businesses, because so many people have built and written up methodologies for using code to make money for businesses; you can literally start by reading up on those, and offering them to clients who don't already do them.

Yet neither the C++98 standard nor TR1 fixed the template/right problem, despite it being a major source of headaches among C++ programmers, because compiler writers complained about the complexity it would have added to the grammar.  It was not until the majority of commonly-used C++ compilers began to emit a suggestion about the problem that the committee finally fixed it in C++11, and even then, the committee had to convince compiler writers that it was a good idea.  That same pattern of behavior can be seen with the double exception faults:  compiler writers were unwilling to put in the effort needed to catch an exception before the stack is unwound (without making compiled code slower), and so instead the standard was updated to further cement the idea that destructors should never throw exceptions.<p>No, it is not purely for compiler writers, but compiler writers and library implementors are a powerful group on the standards committee.",1353349969

You'll probably start off with a lower hourly at first, but you can quickly establish a higher rate and then eventually a consistent weekly as patio11 described.

The scope needs to be clear and you have to prevent any scope creep, as that will negatively affect your rate. Once you've gone through a project or two this way, you will have established a pretty good reputation with your clients, which would let you bill out at the real rate.

When I was living in Japan, I was <i>shocked</i> at how people saw entrepreneurship in an undesirable light. In fact, new graduate polls showed that the most desirable type of profession was a public sector worker, followed by megacorp employee, then SME employee. Entrepreneur was literally at the bottom of the ladder [1].<p>This is in sharp contrast to the States, where polls show that people look up to and want to become entrepreneurs (the ""start ups are cool"" mentality) and see public sector workers as the most undesirable type of employment [2].<p>It's hard to live a life that isn't widely socially accepted, and having a society that looks favorably upon entrepreneurship or sole proprietorships is hugely important for giving people the peace of mind and confidence to embark on their individual paths [3]. Say what you will about the current proliferation of startups, but anything that promotes the long term social acceptability of starting a company is a net positive in the long run for making it easier for people to take the plunge themselves in the future.<p>Our environment skews our perspective, and our perspective determines what we think is possible. We tend to believe in the triumph of the individual spirit and determination over mental hurdles, but it's a rare specimen that has the both the hard skills to create something great and the mental power to actually convince themselves to do so against conventional wisdom. Don't you that that it'd be desirable to reduce the mental hurdles so that those with different mental predispositions can roam freely?<p>[1] I think doctor/lawyer/accountant were omitted because there are very few who enter these professions each year and is statistically somewhat irrelevant.<p>[2] This isn't to say that working in the public sector is actually a bad gig or not useful, but public perception does matter in many ways in attracting talent.<p>[3] In fact, patio11's lifestyle is generally derided in Japan, even though us HN'ers look up to the example he sets both in terms of skills and lifestyle. I have friends who work in the same city that patio11 used to (and perhaps even in the same industry...) who cannot get themselves to leave their megacorp jobs even though they have mid-5-figure income streams from their side gigs that they could obviously grow if they resigned from their day jobs and committed themselves to it. Their reasoning? They fear that they would no longer be accepted by society without said megacorp job. You need supreme confidence in your self worth to live without the ""social proof"" of an establishment on your shoulder in this culture, and it's a disservice to the world that great talent remains locked up because of this.",1353349649

Diversity among the speakers is part of this! Just as surely as you wouldn't want a program of people all from the same company - like it or not, the makeup of the speakers does send a message, and part of the responsibility of organizing an event is deciding what that message will be. It's also communicated by all sorts of other things, including the process for soliciting and choosing submissions, details of language and graphic design, etc. All of these things contribute to a general impression of what the community is like.<p>The claim of ""coincidence"" in this instance would be a lot more convincing if the procedures and language were there to back it up.

First of all, I can only comment on the deal i think occurred since I unfortunately, like you all, don't have any of the important details of this deal.<p>Nonetheless, I can't really understand what exactly was going through Elop's head when he made that deal with Microsoft. How, as a CEO, can you make such a move? The guy cornered himself, or gets cornered (or persuaded even) to only make phones for the least popular OS on the mobile phone market (maybe not the least popular, but certainly not the leading),  which not only is a strategically weak situation with no maneuvering, but ensures that you're company is going to lose.<p>Microsoft has shown this year that it doesn't care, it's part of the deal is open, it can get any OEM to make phones for it's platform, but, Nokia cannot!!!

Leave them with something stellar, and go the extra mile even if it means only 5 minutes of work extra fixing something they never asked you to fix or paid you for. It takes 5 minutes, and makes a tremendous impression on them.<p>I'm making this statistic up, but based on what I see it's gotta be over 90% of people don't do just a few simple things.

This is not the same as Iain's laughable example of having made multiple visits to nightclubs that contain black people.<p>Given that we have never experienced that life, we probably shouldn't tell minorities how they should feel, and what they should be afraid of, <i>or if we're not careful we're going to get a reputation for being oppressive.</i>",1353348547

And YC has a lot of it on the companies they've funded.  The data is valid and the conclusions reached after looking at the data are just as valid.  I am not disputing that at all in any way whatsoever.<p>I also think that it is very important to understand that this data set is about investors risking their money on complete strangers with ideas.  That's an important distinction when compared with, say, you risking your own money (or family money) on a venture.  I have navigated business long enough to know that most people have absolutely no problem burning through someone else's money and delivering absolutely nothing in the process.<p>So, yes, I think that if I were in their shoes I would probably want to increase my odds of getting a return on my investment.  And, if the data showed that single founders of the kinds usually populating these young-founder tech startups tend to fail I'd be just as biased against the whole concept as they might be.<p>What I have attempted to argue to some degree is that the solo founder experience might be very different when the company is not the result of a relationship between people who might have nothing to loose (young college-age founders) and an investment group.<p>I would be curious to see if a larger data set exists somewhere that might cover all types of startups --not just tech-- and have enough information to be able to see what factors might influence success and failure.  I would suspect that the number of founders is less of a driver than one might think.<p>> It seems that you are feeling the same way I do sometimes when I read HN. That there is this great injustice in that young readers are somehow being brainwashed into believing there is only one way to be in business.<p>I don't think in terms of injustice.  HN is a forum.  In the end it matters not. People tend to learn when life and reality touches them.  Reality is hard to argue with.<p>One of the best examples I have of this is the son of a good friend of mine.  As he went through college he bought into an extreme liberal point of view that even his moderate liberal father was uncomfortable with.  He did absolutely nothing about it.  The kid graduated, got his very first job and was elated.  A couple of weeks later he is over at his dad's house irate about the amount of money the government took out of his paycheck for ""all kinds of crap that makes no sense; and they waste most of it"" --as he put it.  Needless to say, Dad had a conversation with him.  The kid's political and social views changed almost 180 degrees when he actually experienced real-life.<p>On HN I can always tell when someone is voicing opinion without ever having started and run a business.  It is obvious to anyone who has been in the trenches.  People say really stupid shit about business and business owners when they don't have a clue.  On sites like HN, Techcrunch or Mixergy it is easy to feel like you setup shop on Friday and by the next Friday you should be funded and at a run rate of $1MM per year.  The reality is that you are far more likely to fail ten or twenty times before you succeed.  This, to get back on topic, is where a multiple founder team might  --huge emphasis on ""might""-- do better than a single founder.  A lot of people are not wired to endure the extreme pain and agony of a business that is failing or not doing well.  A small group of people who mesh very well and have common goals could help each other endure these events.<p>One of my favorite quotes:<p>""Someone holding a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way""  --Mark Twain.",1353348159

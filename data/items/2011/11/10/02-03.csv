3218642,comment,3217162,3218361,8,0,sbierwagen,,,"You have confused ""what a national defense agency has said their reason for doing something is"" with ""why they are <i>actually</i> doing something"".<p>The <i>stated</i> reason is not terribly compelling. Deorbiting satellites are very small, the Earth is very large. As the article correct points out, nobody has <i>ever</i> been injured by space debris, or even killed. Dozens of people are killed by cars every day, yet each automobile fatality does not make it into the New York Times.<p>Note the timeline of the two ASAT tests. China shoots down a satellite in January. One month later, the United States does the same thing, presumably in response. Why are the Chinese shooting down satellites?<p>A critically important piece of context is that China really, really hates satellite-guided bombs, such as the American JDAM. This is because the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was hit by five JDAMs during the 1999 NATO operation in Yugoslavia, killing three people, and injuring twenty others.[1]<p>The American position is that this was a simple mistake in targeting, as they were attempting to strike a Yugoslavian arms warehouse 180 metres away. The Chinese maintain the Bill Clinton personally ordered the attack, possibly while drinking the blood of Chinese infants, as a part of his mad genocidal urge to destroy the entire Chinese race. (The reaction of the Chinese media to the bombing was remarkably hysterical; it's essentially their 9/11, only they didn't have the option of invading the US)<p>Various cynical independents have pointed out that, five weeks earlier, the Yugoslavians had actually managed to shoot down a F-117, the only combat loss ever sustained by a stealth aircraft, and that the Chinese had been seen buying recovered debris from locals. You could make an amazing jump in deduction here, and conclude that they had been storing debris in their embassy, in the hopes that the Americans wouldn't bomb it in retaliation.<p>The JDAM depends on GPS satellites, which have to be in a fairly low orbit, for accuracy, and so that the receivers can use small antennas; where they are fairly vulnerable to ASAT missiles. (I don't believe any current ground-based ASAT missiles can hit targets in geosynchronous orbit, which is 15,000 kilometres higher than MEO. This is an educated guess, not a certainty: governments are chary about giving out details on the performance envelope of missiles.)<p>An ASAT weapon isn't something you want to use at the drop of a hat. Blowing something up in orbit produces a <i>lot</i> of debris, most of which hangs out in space for years. There's various doomsday scenarios, of varying plausibility, where blowing up a satellite produces high-velocity shrapnel which destroys other satellites, which in turn fragment, producing a cascade of destruction, throwing us back into the stone age.<p>In conclusion, you <i>can</i> blow it up, but you probably don't <i>want</i> to.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._bombing_of_the_Chinese_emb...</a>",1320893263

The difference between them and others is that they make an effort (The world tends to focus on results and not on getting there), their sincerity, and what they have to say can stand on it's own even despite the lack of great elocution in how they speak their ideas and works would stand on their own.",1320893177

It's also an approximate 10% yearly bonus held for 5 years. I would rather have the bonus up front instead of the carrot on the string deal.",1320890588
3218523,comment,3218188,3218188,1,0,tikhonj,,,"I think my school has the best option--rather than a ""Software Engineering"" degree, we have an ""Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences"" program. In practice, this means we end up taking the intro courses for both EE and CS and then we can mix and match however we like. Somebody could specialize entirely in theoretical CS or go for a more practical engineering education. You could also focus on EE almost exclusively, if that's what you want. This program provides significant freedom and versatility--I can basically do whatever I want once I'm done with the intro series--while ensuring that even the theoretically biased CS students understand how the computer works at a lower level and the EE students understand what people will be doing with their processors.<p>My impression is that most ""Computer Engineering"" programs--I suspect that ""Software Engineering"" is similar as well--are less flexible. With the EECS major you're free to basically do anything related to computers; ""Computer Engineering"" on the other hand is more about lower-level CS and some high-level EE. You could specialize in Human-Computer Interaction, AI or Machine Learning in EECS, which are all fields that (as far as I know) do not fall under ""Computer Engineering"".<p>However, my only real experience is with my university. I only have a vague idea of how exactly this all works at other universities, but they seem to split the subject area I'm covering into two or three different majors. If EECS is what you meant by ""Software Engineering""--it is computer related, and it is in the college of Engineering--then I am taking it, and don't regret my choice at all.",1320890585

It is a sort of unquestioned dogma that content must be laid out vertically in a linear fashion.  If I remember correctly, what was being proposed was something more contextual or reactive in nature, like flipping pages left and right or some other topology.  That doesn't seem like it differs too much from hyperlinks so I must not be recalling some important fact.<p>Anyways, hopefully someone who knows more about what I'm trying to remember will see this.",1320890564

But you can't have your cake and eat it too: if that's what you order, it's coming with a side of corruption (and a mixed metaphor fresh out of the blender).",1320890528

The great hacker strives to know not just WHAT it is, but WHY it is. The deep understanding that results from such an approach gives the great hacker a massive edge because he'll see opportunities that nobody else can, and will know off the bat what the fallout will be for any proposed solution to a problem.<p>The great hacker reads tech manuals for fun. He picks up strange, esoteric knowledge because it's interesting. This trains his brain to pick new things up quickly, and discover patterns in anything he examines or does.<p>The great hacker's code is as simple and elegant and readable as possible. When you look at it, it all seems so easy. And yet anyone else would have written something far more complex and error prone.<p>A great hacker is a craftsman. His code is functional art. He looks back on his work with a critical eye, searching for flaws. That being said, real artists ship.",1320890406

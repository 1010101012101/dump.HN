Outrage + Large amount of anonymous people = witch hunts. And I don't care if the guy's a serial rapist (which he isn't, not that you could tell with the acid-dipped keyboards in play) witch hunts are never a good thing. Accusations are thrown and innocent people's lives are impacted based on the flimsiest of evidence sometimes. Best to ban that outright and let people organize their raids elsewhere.<p>I also assume it would put them (the site owners) on shaky legal ground.<p>Reddit bans four things that I know of. Personal info, illegal pictures of minors, exploits targeting the users, and spam. There are very good justifications for every one of those.",1350579526

4669639,comment,4669234,4669234,41,0,EvanMiller,,,"Igor has been one of my programmer heroes for many years now, and I'm glad to learn more about his background through this article. The reading's a bit tough, as many verbs appear to be missing and a few Russian words remain untranslated. Some interesting takeaways:<p>* Igor wrote Nginx while working as a sysadmin for Rambler. Classic bottom-up innovation: he could see Apache's shortcomings in a very up-close and personal way. This also explains why Rambler does not hold the copyright on Nginx (see the end of the interview).<p>* He is quite modest when comparing Nginx to other web servers. This reflects well on his character, but perhaps has ""slowed"" the adoption of Nginx. It's clear from this article that Igor is an engineer, not a salesman. I find this to be refreshing in an era when many open-source projects seem to achieve adoption by being the loudest, rather than by being the best.<p>* Igor put off starting a company until there was just too much work for him to do alone. I liked this quote: ""I rarely change my life direction: for example, [before] Rambler, I spent seven years working for a company, [and at] Rambler, I also worked for ten years. Change is hard for me. But, nevertheless, by the spring of this year, I did finally decide to found a company that would help the further development of the project.""<p>* Despite having U.S. investors, Nginx's engineering team is based in Russia. One interpretation is that you don't need to be in the Valley to develop a first-rate product; you just need to be in the Valley when it's time to hustle it.<p>Anyway, an interesting read. Apparently this article is his first public interview. I know Igor doesn't like publicity, but it's inspiring to read his story.",1350579498

Radio in general is very leaky - even rather low power and directional beams can be detected off axis if they travel enough distance and you have sensitive enough equipment. In general you just need a few antennas (or even one, if your're a masochist) and an ability to point them at things. Check for when the signal is the strongest, and check for timing between the receivers and you can get a very good idea of where the transmission comes from. In practice you could do this with multiple antennas (an array) on a single satellite, multiple other satellites or spacecraft, or simply an aircraft or trucks if you control the ground space. I'm willing to bet it's usually done on the targeted bird itself, they aren't completely cut off from communication, have multiple antennas and can even adjust their attitude if it was necessary.<p>This is broadly how the SETI program works for example.",1350579202

If you have many hundreds of threads then this will involve fetching thread contexts from main memory (it may even with a few, I'm not sure on this). So the theory is that if don't absolutely need all of these things to run concurrently then you can design your workload to use these cycles instead of wasting them on switching back and forth, and get your work done faster.<p>I'm sure that hardware and operating systems are designed with this in mind and the effect is reduced, but it's still going to be a factor.<p>And I know we all have machines with gigabytes and gigabytes of RAM these days, but limiting the number of threads used is going to have a huge effect on memory footprint, which is still important in a lot of places (embedded/mobile etc).<p>Thread pools can/could be written to auto-tune, depending on the nature of the workload. The human is only comparing times over multiple runs, you can do this programmatically though this is more coding overhead. It does need to tune to the specific machine though, as all sorts of factors will affect the result. I'm not going to pretend they're a panacea but they can still be useful as they provide flexibility and a way around the context-switch costs.<p>EDIT - Also thread pools don't <i>require</i> tuning, and are not even necessary at all in this situation, people (self included) are just reacting to the idea of throwing orders of magnitude more threads at a system than it has processors, and expecting optimal results.",1350578906

This only disrupts the one receiving dish, so the attack\nis isolated.<p>Jamming the uplink is much easier. All you have to do is over-power the\nsignal from the transmission station(s) up to the satellite. Encryption\ndoesn't do you any good. Having redundant uplinks also doesn't do much\ngood since the resources of the satellite are limited, and the amount of\npower you can get here on the ground is more or less unlimited by\ncomparison. There are multiple uplink transponders (chunks of spectrum\nused as carrier frequencies), and you can allocate them in a redundant\nfashion, but it's expensive due to the limited resources on the sat.<p>The interesting, and undisclosed, question is whether or not the attack\nis only affecting the BBC? If so, then it's a more sophisticated attack\ntargeting just the carrier frequencies (uplink transponders) being used\nby the BBC. A high power wide-band attack is crude but easier to\nperform, and would jam all of the channels broadcast from the satellite\nsince it would over-load all of the uplink transponders.<p>Sadly, there are still a lot of old and poorly designed satellites\nstill in use; it's kinda like finding unfixable Win95 systems on your\nnetwork infected with malware. Since they're in orbit and cost a whole\nlot of money, fixing or replacing them aren't a viable options.<p>The only good news for older satellites is both the uplink (to\nsatellite) and the downlink (to ground receivers) often have somewhat\nadjustable footprints. If you can identify the ground location of the\njamming signal, you <i>might</i> be able to exclude its region from the\nuplink footprint. The trouble is, if the satellite is also being used\nfor things like sat-phones, then you just cut off all customers in the\nexcluded area of the uplink footprint.<p>By the fact that this was made public, there's probably nothing that can\nbe technically done about the jamming.",1350578541

In at least some instances we want them to make moral judgements, so long as thos moral judgements are within and guided by the law.<p>This is especially true in sentencing.  For a minor traffic violation, a cop has discretion to say ""You were speeding, but you have a totally clean record and it wasn't much, this time you get a warning.""  Most people want them to be able to do that and it is a mostly moral judgement.  A prosecutor can say, ""You met all the technical definitions of the crime, but you had extenuating circumstances.  I decline to prosecute.""  Sometimes that is based on either law (the extenuating circumstance, like self defense, is explicitly recognized), or the evidence (its a close call whether they could win and they have ""bigger fish to fry""), but sometimes its a straight moral call.  Often we want them to be able to make that moral call.<p>With judges it depends on the jurisdiction, but they often have enormous discretion once it comes to sentencing.  In many jurisdictions, the legislature hands out some guidelines, but just guidelines.  The same crime might get many years in prison or probation, depending on the judge's moral decision about whether that instance of the crime was heinous or more excusable and whether the judge thinks that person is a career criminal or someone who gave into temptation once.<p>They must follow the law, but within the law we as a society explicitly hand out a lot of discretion at different points and we expect part of that discretion to be used to make moral calls within the framework of the law.",1350578376

If actual bad guys (organized crime, drug cartels, spies, terrorists, governments, script kiddies, or anyone else working outside the law) can communicate and operate with impunity, the technology is not an unequivocally good thing.  The broadly accepted way we deal with this is to have warrant-based interception and eavesdropping; it's hard to argue that our law enforcement services would best operate without any tools other than direct physical surveillance.  So presumably even Mega would need to comply with legal wiretapping requests.  Happily for Mega, and unhappily for law enforcement, doing it at the server doesn't get them anything with this scheme.  But that simply compels law enforcement to get much more invasive, in a way that's hard for citizens to monitor: Find a way to install eavesdropping tools on the suspect's machine so access is gained before encryption.<p>I'm not sure where all this is headed; it's a brave new world.<p>(Heading off potential replies about the growing use of warrantless wiretaps -- of course those are unacceptable.

4669395,comment,4668747,4668907,1,0,rz2k,,,"The FCC has a policy whereby they absolutely refuse to approve content before it airs, even if networks explicitly ask. This is not a legal requirement, since the FCC levies fines for content that does not meet ""community standards"", it is deference to the fundamental principles of free speech whereby they would have a de facto pre-approval board.<p>Both this post and the Gawker post bizarrely talk about free speech as though it is an excuse for bad behavior. Free speech is considered a social good in its own right. Furthermore, in the writings of the authors of the US Constitution, and in numerous Supreme Court decisions, they do not only talk about government being prohibited from silencing people, they talk about policies that are implicitly dangerous by virtue of cooling the public debate.<p>Defending the principles of free speech is a difficult challenge when it comes to defending unpleasant and despicable groups. I don't find it credible or reasonable to claim that Reddit protected violentacres because it made them money, when it so clearly tarnishes their brand, and makes it more difficult for people to forward links, or otherwise talk about why they enjoy the site.<p>The economics may be counter intuitive (much in the same way that Lance Armstrong hurts the Nike brand now as much as he may have ever benefited it), but Reddit is more responsive to the criticism of despised groups <i>because</i> of its commercial interests. Take a nonprofit, community access television channel like Manhattan Neighborhood NetworkI swear that I saw a show on that channel that had to be entirely about some creeper who was filming women walking by his apartment window on the way to work.<p>This post, and others, are based on the presumption that caring about the principles of free speech, and that recognizing that often ugly but lively debate is important to a dynamic society, is the same as wanting to see depraved and perverse content. Do they think the ACLU secretly sympathetic to neo-nazi causes, too?<p>I find it especially troubling when it comes from journalists make the same presumption, and then clarify that they are implicitly more trustworthy (even if they've ever knocked on the door to someone's home with a camera crew) than someone misbehaving on a public site, or that that is even relevant, as though there are different classes of people when it comes to how much of a voice you are allowed.",1350576322

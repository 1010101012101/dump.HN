Thus, it is to his advantage to contest every point, because the longer the match wears on, the greater his edge over his opponent.  You might think of it as though Nadal has unlimited resources relative to his opponent.  In that case, conservation is a worse strategy than playing every point because it fails to exploit one of his advantages.",1233928767

This is fine, but if you're not willing to dedicate serious energy to keeping your skills up to date, you are going to be forced to contend either with an income plateau, or a move into management.",1233928232
469711,comment,469258,469258,0,0,markessien,,,"It appears to me that an economic depression is the best time to invest in projects that last for a long time. When you have a depression, people are cheap, things are cheap, and it is a bit safer to print money because people are tending to hoard money - in this case, you take money and sink it into needed material things like roads and schools that last for decades.<p>At some point in the future, things get back to normal, but now you have a whole bunch of new roads and nicer schools that were built when things were a bit cheap.<p>And as an added side effect, you put a lot of money into circulation, which should lead to more purchasing and spending, which will reactivate the economy.<p>The train system in the U.S for example, should be upgraded. I've seen videos of some cities, and they really looked almost 3rd world - such places should be invested in.",1233928160

What economists say is loosing credibility every time they open their mouth.<p>To even make an educated guess is hard. This is an unpopular thing but its time people realize if you want to help, save your money in a higher interest savings account (ingdirect is what I use), keep working, and never let anyone make you feel bad for the job you have.

469694,comment,469320,469639,0,0,wallflower,,,"I'll try to dig up the link later but I remember a Time or Newsweek cover story that said that the number one reason teachers quit the profession is the students' parents. I recall two horrifying stories from it: 1) A parent calling to complain about a 'C' that her daughter got because she <i>wrote</i> the daughter's report, 2) A college student handing his cellphone during class to the professor. On the line was his irate parent to complain for his kid about a grade.<p>That being said, I've discussed this with my friends many times and I've gradually been convinced that more than anything - parents' involvement in their education was/is vitally important.

My impression was that the percentages who go on to academic (not including vocational) university education was in the teens. This is based on family in Switzerland, but the data is probably stale at this point (1980s).<p>I should point out that I'm not against a third or half of Americans getting some kind of free higher education. I just think it's a waste for them to have an <i>academic</i> education, when only a minority of jobs require one. Appropriate vocational training would be better.",1233926825

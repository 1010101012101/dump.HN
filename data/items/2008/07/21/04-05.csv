Any more than that, and you're sliding into irrelevant fluff.<p>A good design means I get to the best possible search results with as little extra cruft as possible. Results are key. Google's design gives me just that -- no clutter, no confusion, no extraneous elements.",1216616049

I'd wager that 37s would have done just fine if you'd started in the same city. So maybe the lesson to the poster should just be: stop worrying and get back to business.",1216615860
251976,comment,251774,251922,0,0,izaidi,,,"I'm not an expert on this stuff but if you're just changing the IPs and not the actual NS records for the domain, the changes will be pretty much instantaneous, depending on how quickly your DNS service registers updates. I use DNS Made Easy and they usually take about ten or twenty minutes to accept a changed IP; once it goes into their records it's reflected everywhere immediately.",1216615670
251975,comment,251774,251943,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Well, JS is turing-complete and that's both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because you can do ""anything"", but it's a curse because unconstrained code is opaque. It's very hard to do stuff like extracting the semantics (what you meant to express when you wrote the code) out of JS and doing things like transformations without an unreasonable amount of work.<p>I think it's better to express as much as you can in a more ""constrained"" language like HTML or CSS because it's more like data than code, so it offers less opportunities to make a big mess of spaghetti code and having obscure interactions in the code. It's easier to reason about. HTML and CSS, being declarative, are much easier and cleaner to deal with than JS (it's more WYSIWYG).<p>So I guess what I'm saying is, coding in a style that avoids JS as much as possible is beneficial, and that style facilitates graceful degradation. Conversely, keeping an eye on graceful degradation will facilitate a better style.",1216615580

251973,comment,251584,251584,0,0,code_devil,,,"I think its handy to have a start in the programming world with C or C++. It being your first language, you will definitely have a good grasp of pointers, memory etc (as they are closer to the machine). Infact, I had taken an assembly language class(sopho/junior year) as well in school where we had to sometimes hand compile an Instruction to Binary. I thought it was really cool to actually see a PSHA (Push register AR) convert to say 1011 1001 and how it triggers the gates in a microprocessor. I hardly use assembly in work or personal projects, but knowing all these memory saving techniques definitely help you in writing good code in Higher Language Languages.",1216615405

I use unique forwarding e-mails for every website I'm signed up to, and I've noticed a lot of spam harvested from Github.  It makes me feel less warm & fuzzy about an otherwise excellent website.<p>Using one of the first two methods in the article is simple, so why not implement it?  You're right that spammers will eventually get widely used e-mails, but you can minimize the chance it's your website's fault.  The only reason I can see not to do it is cross-browser/accessibility issues.  Does anyone know if these techniques cause problems?",1216614821

Its one thing to hear or read the advantages, but its a whole another thing to actually experience it.<p>My co-founder and I tried working remotely, and although productive it is nothing compare to being in the same room. I finally decided to move to where he is for 3 months.<p>(Your Point #1): I sub-leased an apartment and setup shop in the living room of a 1 bedroom apartment. It's closer to his house so the commute isn't that bad, since I live here I only pay rent and not a lease on an office.<p>(#2): Communication techniques for remote work won't come in handy once you get funding and are asked by the VCs to move to one city. Knowing how well you work with your co-founder(s) in the same space before funding is very valuable.<p>(#3): Working in a productive environment is definitely key, but you have to make it productive no matter where you are since you are a startup. It could be a coffee shop if it HAS to be.<p>(#4): Investors want to meet the entire team, they will be concerned if you mention ""we work remotely.""<p>(#5): No one starts a global company, they start a company that goes global.<p>It is a strain on finances but its good to do it for 3 months at a time, specially in summer time because in big cities you can get sub-leases for short period (furnished).<p>Good luck!",1216614234

The first four words refer to the <i>class</i>, and the last four refer to the <i>function</i>;  moreover, one of the words in the former is <i>implied</i> by the latter.  So, when you munge it all together, and include more words than necessary, then yeah, it sounds complicated.  Thing is, nobody actually <i>does</i> that, unless they're writing articles that bash C++.

The fact that the base class is declared ""virtual"" is of no consequence to the destructor.)<p>There's no doubt that C++ is a complicated language, but if you're going to criticize it, at least reach for something that's a bit more insightful than <i>""you can obfuscate your code!""</i>",1216612990

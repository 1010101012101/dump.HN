Also, wanted to see if maybe he was afraid of being really wealthy--which is a hangup many folks have when offered large sums of money. in fact, many times entrepreneurs are offered sums of money that are disproportionate to the amount of time they have put in (think Bebo, and frankly, Weblogs Inc.).<p>when that happens it is a very, very hard thing for some folks to understand... at least intelligent, considered people.",1269107832

The Visa or MC logo give you a false sense that it has the same fraud protection and benefits as your credit card. It does not. And it has a great deal more potential to disrupt your life in the event of fraud.<p>And moreover, signature based debit card transactions make the bank the exact same amount of revenue as the same transaction on a credit card. As long as you pay the card off every month then what we're talking about wrt revenue is the discount rate. A merchant provider doesn't distinguish between types of cards-- they all have the same fees-- they only distinguish between issuer (Visa/MC vs Discover and Amex).",1269107702

Let's divide ads into two categories:<p>- ""Punch the monkey for herbal supplements.""  There are a lot of ads for gimmick products or products that simply don't work well at all.  (Some are pure scams, and some just advertise terrible things, but we might as well lump them all together.)  People still buy them, because people are credulous.<p>- Targeted ads for useful products.  On Stack Overflow right now I see an ad for some tool that analyzes log files and spits out metrics and data.  That sounds pretty useful, but the ad is not helping me make an informed decision.  If I decided right now to buy that product, even if it worked for me, the ad would not have served me well.  The better way to buy things is to decide what you need, make an independent survey of the products available to you, and figure out which one is best via reviews, experts, comments, specs.  Successful ads encourage you to short-circuit this process and just pick something, which I don't think is a positive thing.",1269107611

It can be surprisingly cheap to run a TV campaign.<p>You can go through the local network stations or the actual cable providers.  Both will help you put together the ad (cheap if not free, quality depends on the idea, ie horrible car ads)<p>You can also pick your channels and general time frames that you want your ad to air in.  So if you are targeting parents who own their home, you could select HGN, DIY, etc. and set the time frame to between 5 pm(afterwork) to 12 am(pre-sleep).<p>Same with radio in terms of dealing directly with the radio stations.  You can write your copy, tell them you want one of the on air personalities to read it to some music.  In a couple hours you can have a few different ads to choose from.  It is surprisingly cheap to dominate any given radio station if you are in the right media market(not Boston or the likes).<p>When it comes to internet startups, the real problem with TV, Radio, or offline advertising in general is the bad conversion and lack of metrics like we are used to in the online world.<p>We are already used to single digit(or less) conversion rates for online advertising campaigns.  You can imagine how much more that drops when your ads are reaching people who might not even be by a computer and are expecting them to remember your brand/product next time they are.<p>As for metrics, the easiest thing you can do is have control and variable zip codes.

I can't imagine not working, that sounds so boring, so DHH has found what he loves to do and is doing it.

Illicit drugs however, pay well.<p>As for the incarceration numbers: ""<i>According to the most recent figures available from the FBI, police arrested an estimated 786,545 people on marijuana charges in 2005 -- more than twice the number of Americans arrested just 12 years ago. Among those arrested, about 88 percent -- some 696,074 Americans -- were charged with possession only. The remaining 90,471 individuals were charged with ""sale/manufacture,"" a category that includes all cultivation offenses, even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use.<p>These totals are the highest ever recorded by the FBI, and make up 42.6 percent of all drug arrests in the United States.

Writing software for already deployed hardware is considered one of the strengths of Free and Open Source software developers. Creating fabs to build silicon chips with 3 year lead times and magically placing them in devices that have already been sold isn't, and I have repeatedly seen this factoid cited as the reason why Theora is hopeless, regardless of all other considerations.<p>Here's a quote from the latest Daring Fireball piece:<p><i>""There are no hardware decoding chips for Ogg Theora. If you want to send video to mobile devices, H.264 is the only practical encoding for the near future.""</i><p>If this point is now made and widely accepted and the discussion has moved on to ""Theora is an inferior codec: worse quality, worse encoding options etc."" then that's great. Inferior is pejorative, and I find ""worse quality"" to be highly misleading, as if every Theora video will look like something on Youtube, but I'd happily admit to ""lower quality per bit"" (in fact I do in the post you replied to) which is okay because it has other advantages and room to grow.",1269104659

The public school system needs to be overhauled to provide better science and engineering education. However, these have been valid arguments for years - even before the 9/11 attacks and the rise of R&D in China and India.<p>I always wonder when the Economist leaves out basic economics. The locations in the USA where engineering, R&D and startup innovation are concentrated are also the most expensive places to live.<p>25 years ago, a research scientist or engineer could make $60K and buy a house in Livermore for $120K. Now, that same house is $1.2M but the salary for a research scientist is still $60K. The immigrant researchers and engineers who originally populated silicon valley now encourage their children to be doctors, lawyers, or increasingly to go into finance (Economics is now #1 major for Smart People).<p>This can be fixed one of two ways: pay engineers and researchers more, or build R&D centers in less expensive areas. Corporations are choosing the second option. Unfortunately (for americans), the less expensive areas they are moving R&D  are located overseas.",1212544614

Real programmers put in error messages, look for abnormal behavior, and document. You don't need to do that, but you should be able to put something together to remove lines, send e-mail, or copy files.""<p>Wow, that's setting the bar pretty low. Whatever an IT Guy is, I don't think I'd want one who told me ""Oh, I only script, I don't program""",1212544219

My technical co-founder has developed proprietary technology as good as the best on the market (microcontroller programming, integrated circuit layout, heatsink, and a unique wireless user-interface) which we are now in the process of commercializing.<p>Our technology is most certainly not a web app! (note: My background is very web2.0 - Director of Product Management for a venture-backed niche social-network and community site, among other things)<p>Honestly, I find it somewhat refreshing to be working wth real customers to develop tangible products again.<p>We are in the process of taking our prototype from the spare bedroom to the spotlight and are currently working on our frst web site. Expect to hear more from us soon.",1212543637
208496,comment,207995,207995,0,0,petervidani,,,"eBay is still much more than an auctioning service.  It's a lightweight platform for anyone-- store owner or housewife-- to sell absolutely anything.  The structure itself is fine, it's the community that's been poisoned.  eBay needs stricter enforcements on its weaknesses: sniping, shipping costs, and PAYPAL.  eBay needs to cut Paypal off with a sword and start clean.  Call it something else because I will never trust that name.  Never in my life has transacting money been more difficult and dangerous.  The interface, the communication with the staff, and the rats that use it.",1212543223

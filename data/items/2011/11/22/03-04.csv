If not put them out of business, it would completely cripple their future prospects. 3M has MASSIVE distribution.

3263998,comment,3263354,3263954,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"Banking salaries go from about 75k (entry-level) to 125k at the 5th year. Bonuses can be from 20 to 500 percent depending on your political success as well as the performance of the firm. Typical is 40-100% in the junior ranks, for a take-home around $200,000 in the fifth year. Decent, but not worth the suffering (and attrition) involved.<p>Base salaries in finance and consulting are low, even at senior ranks, compared to the level of the position. Finance makes it up in bonus (if you last a year). Consulting makes it up with introductions to large-company CEOs so that if you hit a ceiling, you have options. Law has mediocre bonuses but more restrained hours and minimal travel.<p>If you count hours 41 to 60 as time-and-a-half and 61-plus as double-time, these jobs actually fare pretty poorly in terms of compensation. At the peak of the finance compensation bubble, first-year bankers at top firms were averaging $140,000 all-in (75k base, 65k bonus). For an 80-hour workweek adjusted accordingly, that's $24.50 per hour. If you get fired on day 364 (a common day for that to happen) and fail your bonus, it can be half of that.",1321933953

The difference was how the company utilized their skills and empowered their environment.<p>I find products have a similar sort of way about them, sometimes a product that is a 'dud' in one company, the same idea is a runaway success in another. Perhaps the most cogent example of this would be the TabletPC vs the iPad. (I could have as easily picked the Palm Pilot and the Newton Messagepad) product concepts, product execution, and the ecosystem into which they are born all have a huge impact on the success or failure of the result.<p>HP has a vision problem, I know its the 'what if' company but it does. I've got a few hundred of their servers in a data center that need a BIOS update, one of their suggestions? Use the 'Easy update' program on a DVD they would send me. Seriously? Too many products at HP don't know what they want to be (other than successful and cool, which is never something you make, they are side effects of your execution)<p>At the end of the day WebOS and the Touchpad, were doomed by corporate host they found themselves in. Not a lot of people remember how incensed Microsoft was that people figured out how to hack the Kinect, they threatened to sue people, now they brag about all the cool things people are doing with it. That was an example of something that just barely escaped death at the hands of its acquirer.<p>I'm sure HP wishes they had their $3.3B back, but I bet they would spend it all again if they could figure out how to re-enable the company to execute on new concepts.",1321933845

Biggest tip I can give is to disable extensions, I do that and the Chromebook flies. Then just slowly add back in the most necessary ones. This might solve your video issues too, as video works perfectly smooth for me. If you doubt this, just hop into guest mode and see how ridiculously fast such meager hardware moves when your own bloat isn't slowing it down.<p>On Google+ you should really scroll with the ""j"" and ""k"" keys, problem solved. :P",1321931197

Previous attempts have resulted in bloodbaths because the only way anyone can design a society is with large amounts of force. And then the state of the society is better characterized by the bloodbath than by whatever design the bloodbath was intended to create or enforce.<p>Unintended consequences aren't the only reason you can't design society. The main reason is that society insists on designing itself. It's obvious with a processor who is the designer and what is the designed. Societies are full of people who don't agree with other people's ""designs"" and won't voluntarily cooperate. So either you give up, or you spend most of your time designing cost-effective means of imposing your designs by force, which always turns into some combination of mass imprisonment, mass murder, and repression.",1321931131

Entry-level ""white shoe"" law positions are horrible, and junior-level investment banking is an atrocity. If that's what they're calling ""elite firms"", then their standards are low. Those careers are miserable for the first 5 years-- unless proof-reading pitch books at 3:00 am on a Sunday is your thing.<p>Worth noting is that these firms go after <i>mediocre</i> Ivy graduates. The 3.8 CS majors are overqualified (except for quant positions). It's not about intelligence. It's only somewhat about social status. Mostly, it's about the people they're trying to hire: status-hungry kids with an <i>unconditional</i> work ethic. These people make bad hires in technology (unimaginative, egotistical) but are great junior I-bankers because they'll do whatever is put in front of them, even if it's the most awful work in ridiculous volume, for the sake of prestige.<p>What is the profile of the 25th-percentile (as opposed to 50th or 75th) Ivy Leaguer?

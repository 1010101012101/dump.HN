590338,comment,589677,589677,0,0,aminuit,,,"From the link: ""The CrossTwine Linker engine reduces the execution times by a factor of up to 4×.""  So let's say my program takes 10 seconds to run, then this will reduce my run time by 4 x 10 seconds, so it will run in -30s?  I know it's pedantic, but things like this kill me.<p>Also, performing computationally intensive tasks in Ruby is somewhat akin to racing the Tour de France on fixed gear bicycle.  Sure you'll look cool, but you're doing it wrong.",1241308701

Unfortunately when we receive guests it's sometimes the case that we'll have to choose (or should I say guess) between doing as usual and risk appearing rude or doing the waiting just in case.",1241308679

I mean, even if Government’s doing a bad thing competently we can fight to change that.<p>But I think the reality is that big bureaucracies end up creating so many rules and regulations that not even they can sort it out.  Which is why we have such a complex tax code in the first place and why Government has to force each citizen to do their own taxes.",1241308220
590331,comment,590268,590272,0,0,bonaldi,,,"Yep, same in UK. For the vast majority of people: low-middle income, one employer, the employer works out your tax and deducts it monthly for you. No tax reporting forms, and if a mistake is made over the year, it's repaid at the end.<p>The only time you do a tax return is if you earn over a preset limit, or if you have multiple substantial income sources.",1241308204
590330,comment,552850,553323,0,0,krokas,,,"I can rather suggest use libJIT instead of LLVM overkill. libJIT is both faster, platform independent, and much easier in use than LLVM (or GNU lightning).<p>Also LLVM is not really suitable for JIT compilation. For instance, LLVM compilation time is just huge, and not suitable for real world JIT compilers. Maybe only for those small toy programs LLVM developers show on conferences. This was one of the many other reasons that for our Just-In-Time compiler we use libJIT. It has been well tested in embedded systems, industrial lasers by TRUMPF Laser division, working on Portable.NET Just-In-Time compiler, and a managed implementation of Windows.Forms.<p>Moreoever, LLVM does not easily support many features needed for implementation of ECMA-335, Microsoft Common Language Infrastructure, Common Language Runtime, Common Intermediate Language, and Common Type System:<p>For instance,<p>These are just a couple of them:<p><pre><code>    * the whole spectrum of ECMA 335 for CLR types and operations 

    * async exception handling 

    * precise stack marking 

    * multiple custom call conventions 

    * fast Just-In-Time compilation

590325,comment,590268,590268,0,0,pavlov,,,"That's pretty much how it works in Finland, at least. You get a ""tax proposal"" in the mail. If it's missing deductions or you have special reporting duties like foreign capital gains, you can amend it and return the form; otherwise you don't have to file anything. (It seems that the majority is satisfied with the proposal as-is, which presumably is a great relief to the tax office compared to the old days when everyone had to file their own forms.)",1241307509

It frees you up to ask stupid questions without (or with less) concern of being labeled a stupid person.<p>I think it was Marvin Minsky who said that children should be encouraged to make mistakes, because that is how you learn.

They just don't include a lot of deductions, and so the bill comes out higher.  To fix it, you then have to file addendum paperwork, which is more time-consuming than the initial tax filing.<p>Edit: There will be late filing penalties, however, because they don't file one for you, unless you fail to file for a long period of time.  And, those can add up to large additional fees.",1241306292

He&#x27;s really getting a lot out of it.<p>It&#x27;s really convenient to get started in. It&#x27;s super helpful that it&#x27;s an IDE with a built-in interpreter and comprehensive help section. The semantics aren&#x27;t that hard to pick up. And it has a built-in basic graphics library.<p>But it&#x27;s lacking in a few areas. The IDE&#x27;s fixed screen resolution is really hard to work with. In general QBasic&#x27;s syntax is confusing and inconsistent. The IDE is missing important features like undo/redo, which I totally forgot about.<p>So I was thinking, why not write a modern alternative? My plan was to build a very lightweight IDE (probably using Qt), that has a built-in interpreter, using a custom language (probably a stripped down version of Ruby without all the crazy). It would probably use something like SDL and export a basic graphics library too. And it would come with a comprehensive help section including a tutorial.<p>Is there any interest in using and/or helping with such a project?<p>(I&#x27;ve looked at a few existing options. Most of them seem to be more drag-n-drop &quot;visual&quot; languages, which I&#x27;m not interested in.)",1390495573

So build something that you enjoy working on, and limit yourself to, say, 3 days.  Link to it, get the code up on GitHub.<p>* Recommendations from your previous employers can still be beneficial to you.  Having a testimonial from someone is going to increase the confidence of anyone looking to work with you.<p>* Go to local networking events.  This is a great way to put yourself out there and start talking to people about what you do.<p>* Related to the above -- practice your elevator pitch.  Instead of technology specific stuff -- &quot;I am a Ruby programmer&quot; <i>yawn</i> try being more specific about what you do &quot;I build mobile applications for small businesses&quot; -- this is more likely to pique somebody&#x27;s interest when you are at a networking event.<p>* Keep scouring jobs boards.  It takes time, but there are a lot of decent jobs out there.  If you want to save a bit of time, sign up to lead generation service -- there are a few out there.  (I run one at <a href=""https://freelancedevleads.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freelancedevleads.com</a> if you are interested).<p>* Enjoy it!

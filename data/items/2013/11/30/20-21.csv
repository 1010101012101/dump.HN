Yes, yes, accumulators and recursion - point is our instructor gave us <i>zero</i> hints about how to think differently, and just kept saying &quot;no, Haskell has no variables.&quot;<p>It might say more about how poorly guided my first encounter with functional programming was, but still, I&#x27;d say that is a <i>lot</i> like what you just described.",1385845142

6824585,comment,6823381,6823633,1,0,fecak,,,"To some people, it means that they probably don&#x27;t feel a Hep vaccine is necessary on the date of birth or perhaps even for longer, because the parents will control the infant&#x27;s environment. If you are taking your baby home, controlling who will touch the baby, what it eats, etc, Hep shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, and the vaccine at day 1 seems like an unnecessary risk (even at 1000000:1 odds of an adverse reaction, the risk of infection may lower due to a newborn&#x27;s lifestyle).<p>That is just one example, but vaccine schedules are impacted by exposure risk, but also by some level of convenience (based on the fact that we don&#x27;t go to doctors every day, so &quot;let&#x27;s vaccinate you as much as we can in the few times we&#x27;ll see you&quot;). If you show up for a well visit and your child is not 100%, do you let the child get the vaccine or do you come back next week/month?<p>Vaccine safety is easier to test under very strict conditions and single vaccinations, but the topic is complicated by varying levels of child health as well as offering vaccines in combination.",1385845056

From a &#x27;prospective developer&#x27; standpoint, I&#x27;m worried about the dependencies and general heft of the thing.  Does it require jQuery UI?  Is there a stripped-down version I can use?  As far as I can tell, the landing page doesn&#x27;t answer these questions.<p>2.  More broadly, I&#x27;d argue that there are two types of <form> implementations: barebones forms that use &#x27;value&#x27; and &#x27;type&#x27; and very little else, and hyper-customized ones that are generated bespoke.  This plugin seems to address the middle of that spectrum: people who need a little -- but not too much -- customization.

It&#x27;s a simple matter of market forces at work.<p>To touch upon your example:  If you want Mark Cuban to do consulting work for you, you pay him what <i>he wants to be paid</i> to do that work.  He wants $25,000/hour.  If you don&#x27;t want to pay the rate--<i>you don&#x27;t have to</i> and he doesn&#x27;t have to do any work for you.  If you just want consulting work done for $500/hour, you could probably hire anyone--but you&#x27;re not getting Mark Cuban.  You&#x27;re also not going to get anywhere close to the best consultants--they usually charge $1000/hour or more.  They can get away with this because the markets, or specifically, other people looking for consultants, are willing to pay them that much for their time.  Consequently, they have a choice--$500/hour consulting for you, or $1000+/hour working for others.  Most likely, they&#x27;ll choose to work for the higher rate unless they have a compelling non-financial reason to work for the lower rate.  You may not think they deserve that much (and on an equitable basis, they probably don&#x27;t), but such concerns are not relevant to determining what the <i>market rates</i> for their services are.",1385844145

That practice isn&#x27;t condoned by the CDC and thinking that might be worse (due to safety of the recipient) isn&#x27;t a concession to anyone. The CDC isn&#x27;t advocating for that, because they surely would have some safety concerns.<p>There are a number of vaccines to give, and if there were no concerns about safety they could all be given at birth. However, there obviously are concerns by manufacturers and the CDC (and of course elsewhere) so the CDC created a schedule. People that question the schedule often question the Hep first, based on the incredibly small chance an infant would come into contact with the virus.<p>Part of the reasoning behind the schedule being the way it is relates to doctor visits. The CDC wants children vaccinated, so accelerating the schedule and giving multiple vaccinations at once isn&#x27;t due to fear of exposure at certain ages as much as the logic of &quot;while you&#x27;re here, let&#x27;s take care of these vaccines as well.&quot;  Kind of like the reasoning behind topping off your fluids during a car&#x27;s scheduled maintenance. No need to bring the car in when you are more likely to run dry on fluids, we&#x27;ll just fill you up while you&#x27;re here.<p>Part of the CDC&#x27;s concern is making sure kids are vaccinated, so the more vaccinations at once mentality makes sense to increase the likelihood of vaccination. Parents would surely be less likely to visit a doctor 15 times in a year than say 2-3 or less.<p>The link below shows the number of vaccines recommended in the first 6 years. Bundling them and accelerating the schedule helps guarantee higher vaccination rates, but can complicate matters when safety of vaccines is harder to test and compare in a multitude of combinations.<p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch...</a>",1385843706

The &quot;I told you so&quot; crowd are cowards who would never stick their necks out to try anything new.  That,  or they have ulterior motives such as job security or income protection.<p>The truth is online education is here to stay and it will get better with time.  It will, eventually, replace big chunks out of traditional education.  Probably not all.<p>My son is currently going through MIT&#x27;s 6.00.1x Intro to Computer Science and Programming on edX.  He is 14 and in High School.  Watching him progress from mechanically typing conditional statements to having his mind opened to computational thinking has been an amazing experience.  Yes, this course is pushing him around and challenging him in big ways.  It isn&#x27;t easy.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, there are only two ways one could succeed with these kinds of courses:  self motivation or external support (or both).  In our case he has all of my support.  I am actually taking the class alongside him so I can see what and how they are teaching in order to help him out.<p>Motivation is a huge factor.  He is a member of the local FRC robotics team and was involved in FLL before that.<p>We work on every problem set in a collaborative manner, with me guiding rather than providing solutions as well as simply being there to expand on topics that are not covered to a great depth (pointers comes to mind).  Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot more watching than guiding as he has definitely begun to think like a programmer and is solving most every problem without external help.<p>For me it&#x27;s been an interesting review of topics I have not touched in years.  Recursion, for example, is something I haven&#x27;t touched in quite some time as I have not run into problems and systems that could justify the resources required when using these techniques.  Playing with recursion in an academic setting and helping my son learn the concept was lots of fun.<p>I can absolutely see that a course such as 6.00.1x would be impossible to complete for a kid without the support of a parent.  Not sure if that parent has to have domain knowledge or not.  I can&#x27;t be a good judge this because I obviously do and all of our conversations have taken advantage of this.<p>I can also see the difficulties in entering into some of these courses without the necessary preparation.  Students who went through school by mechanically doing math without really understanding math tend to not do well on higher level courses regardless of whether these courses are online or in person.<p>There&#x27;s also the case of the working engineer who might need to brush-up on skills before attempting a class.  Using myself as an example, I have not used statistics in any formal way in a long time.  If I wanted to take an online ML class I&#x27;d have to spend an amount of time reviewing statistics and probably a couple of other areas in Calculus.<p>In this sense this is where, perhaps, MOOC&#x27;s do it wrong.  Conventional live courses go through a qualification phase in order to ensure that the &quot;herd&quot; has reasonably uniform and adequate capabilities.  The beauty of MOOC&#x27;s is that anyone can jump in.  And that&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  What might be lacking is a departure from a linear model of teaching.  Why can&#x27;t I enroll in that ML class and, when and as required, take off in a branch and review statistics to then come back and &quot;merge&quot; into the main thread of the class.  Perhaps this non-linear approach is what is missing.<p>All MOOC&#x27;s are pretty much online versions of some kind of a traditional live class.  Lectures, problems, homework, tests.  All presented in a linear timescale and on a similarly linear schedule.  A learning system that is truly after the acquisition of knowledge must work differently.  It must take a highly interactive approach in which the teaching system is flexible enough to, effectively, deliver curriculum that is customized to the needs of each and every person.<p>This is a challenge.  We have to be glad there are people like Thurn who are willing to stick their necks out, try, fail and try again.  The critics are usually people who will never compromise their station in life to try and drive progress.  They don&#x27;t want arrows in their backs.  Far easier to shoot them at pioneers, eventually you hit one or two of them and for a brief moment in time you might actually sound like you know what you are talking about.  Reality, however, is quite different.<p>What I would tell Thurn is:  Don&#x27;t give up.  Don&#x27;t exit the segment.  Try to figure out how to change the approach and make it work.",1385843288

Meaning to generate 100w inside the PC you need 137.5w input, plus whatever distribution losses you have.<p>If you use HVDC supply with rack based DC-DC Converters. So AC-DC (90% efficient) and DC-DC (98% efficient) You can generate 100w with only 112.2w input. Figure that&#x27;s for the the whole rack, verses per chassis power supply conversion for the AC model. You can do one 3.3v one 5v and one 12v power supply per rack. You&#x27;re also saving a huge amount of heat too, heat that you dont need to cycle out thru additional A/C Hardware.",1385841716

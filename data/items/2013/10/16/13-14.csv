6559627,comment,6558352,6558352,4,0,qwerty_asdf,,,"<p><pre><code>  For all Microsoft&#x27;s CEO might have done wrong, he was \n  right about something dismissed by many (and I among \n  them): Google. \n\n  Ballmer started treating the search and information \n  company as a competitive threat about a decade ago. \n  Google as Microsoft competitor seemed simply nuts in \n  2003. How could search threaten Windows, particularly \n  when anyone could type a new web address to change \n  providers? \n\n  Ballmer was obsessed, chasing every Google maneuver, \n  often to a fault. Execution could have been better, but \n  his perception was right.\n</code></pre>\nTwo main points that contradict this line of thinking:<p>1. The idea that Steve Ballmer&#x27;s hostility could be recast as innovation is laughable. Microsoft was pathologically hostile to any competition, and it&#x27;s obvious that this hostility was frequently tuned and recalibrated according to the success of the quarry. If anything, it only reinforces my belief, that if Ballmer were ever permitted to have is way, Ballmer&#x27;s lifelong ambition is to destroy anything good, and replace it with himself.<p>2. Very early on, Google was a better search engine than most others, and it wasn&#x27;t difficult to recognize. Using it, you found what you wanted, and you noticed it when you spent less time searching, and parsing irrelevant crap. Contrast this with the MSN home page (with the earliest form of Microsoft&#x27;s version of a &quot;web search&quot;), which (like AOL) looks and feels like a supermarket tabloid. Ballmer&#x27;s recognition can be readily categorized as jealousy, not genius. My hypothesis is that he tried out Google himself, he liked it, realized it was useful, then realized it was not under his control, and set out to either control it or destroy it. It&#x27;s not inspiring. It&#x27;s not mere competition. It&#x27;s simply another expression of greed.",1381931747

The general idea of the app is to provide a workout/stretch plan to reverse the effects of prolonged sitting.<p>Sitting for long periods of time can cause the quads and hip flexors to become tight, and glutes and abdominals to become weak and inhibited. This is otherwise known as Anterior Pelvic Tilt (APT)!<p>This plan is only 10 minutes long at default, but the settings allow the user to switch it up based on their needs. The number of sets, the exercise duration, and rest intervals can all be changed.<p>No redeem codes, because you know, it&#x27;s free :p<p>I would love any feedback on the app.<p>At the moment, I have focused on the lower-body, but an upper-body (forward head etc) routine is also in the works.",1381930570

It seems like Mozilla&#x27;s argument is that the AS VM is buggy and, thus, is/was/could be exploited often, so it&#x27;s a security liability.<p>Their solution to this problem (as far as I understood) is to interprete the SWF bytecode using JavaScript/HTML5, because JavaScript runs in a sandbox.<p>Isn&#x27;t anyone concerned that this is not the best solution to the problem? What&#x27;s the difference between bugs in the AS VM and bugs in the JS VM? The JS VM is native code too, I don&#x27;t see anyone rushing to replace it.<p>If the JS VM is more mature, then this is just a matter of getting the AS VM to that maturity level. If someone wrote clang while gcc existed for many years, why can&#x27;t Mozilla focus their efforts on writing a better AS VM, instead of writing an emulation layer?<p>Given that both AS and JS are ECMAScripts, why can&#x27;t AS be compiled in a way that allows it to run on the JS VMs?<p>If the bytecode generated by the AS compiler doesn&#x27;t match what a JS VM can execute, then, since the AS bytecode will necessarily mimic features available in the language (and the languages are similar), why can&#x27;t we translate the AS bytecode into JS bytecode?",1381929574

Even with 9 months of a really generously compensated internship (to Midwest standards, at least, I grew up in WI and went to school in MI), I still left college with north of 50k in loans.<p>Ohio University, cost is ~24k a year, more than 12k of which is room, board, transportation and personal. Ohio State this year is 21k, more than half of which is the room and board. For both, tuition and books is about 11-11.5k.<p>You&#x27;d hypothetically already be paying the rest with the 7k / year job that&#x27;s keeping you kicking.<p>4.5k in the stafford loan means, 6k in other loans a year to fill it in at today&#x27;s cost, which is probably 20-40% higher than it was 5 years ago.<p>4 years of loans, even if they&#x27;re shitty, &quot;credit ready&quot; loans at personal loan rates, still only leaves a fictional Ohio traditional student with $45k in student loan debt at the end of the degree. $60 if they take a victory lap.<p>In any STEM discipline, paid internships and co-ops are also possible, which would further reduce the loan load required.<p>So in summary, funding an education is not impossible. Yes, the student will be paying for it for a while. I&#x27;m still paying on my loans and I still will be for a few years. But I&#x27;m sorry, not having parents foot the bill generally isn&#x27;t yet a barrier to a high-quality education.",1381928735

6559395,comment,6548893,6554069,2,0,JoachimS,,,"Havege and other CPU-based entropy sources are interesting. But they do implicit assumptions such as that the TSC is somehow giving you real measurements (and is not virtualized for example) and that the CPU has cache memories, do out-of-order issue etc which makes the exection time variable.<p>We have tested Havege and on modern x86 systems you do get good numbers. But there are embedded SSL stacks that use Havege on such things as AVR32 cpus where the exection time is much more predictable. I have yet to test in those environments, but it does not look like a smart move.<p>Also, Havege includes an entropy estimator that seems to be broken. We used the Simics system simulator and forced the TSC to be stuck and could see that we got bad entropy from Havege. But the estimator happily said that the entropy was good.<p>My suggestion is that if you are to use Havege and friends, use them to feed the OS entropy pool, not as a replacement for /dev/random, /dev/uramndom.<p>And speaking of friends. Jytter is one such friend. I have yet to test it with Dieharder though.<p><a href=""http://jytter.blogspot.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jytter.blogspot.se/</a>",1381928710

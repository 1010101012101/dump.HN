48865,comment,48849,48849,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This completely misses the point about productivity.  In my experience, the #1 reason why workers are only productive for 2/3 of the working day is <i>they have no incentive to do otherwise</i>.  After all, you go home at the same time regardless of whether you finish your work quickly or not.  You probably get paid the same (module a small % raise) regardless of whether you do good work or bad work.<p>People who want to get lots done typically get lots done.  They don't need to resort to productivity tips.  <p>And companies with incentive structures that reward hard work typically get it.  Nucor consistently has some of the highest productivity in the steel industry - their compensation structure involves salaries that range in the $40K range, but bonus that can total up to $130K.  Management consulting firms consistently elicit high effort from employees, because they don't have face time: once you finish your work, you can go home.  Hedge fund managers never seem to goof off, because they get paid 20% of the profits, often amounting to billions of dollars.  Startup founders work for incredibly long and focused periods of time, because they enjoy all the upside of their work.",1188586614

48862,comment,48642,48846,0,0,dood,,,"I've been learning it recently and I'm not sure what to make of it, specifically the ORM component. It certainly has a good reputation as far as ORM's go, but I'm not sure if even a good ORM fits a large, popular, or complex app, or is perhaps more suitable for protoyping and low-traffic uses. <p>But since SQL is pretty necessary for most web apps, it makes sense to pick some abstraction layer, and as far as I can tell SQLA is best of breed for scripting languages, so I'm trying to work out how to apply it most effectively.",1188586308

48858,comment,48553,48673,0,0,weebro,,,"Thanks for the history lesson.  Now, let an Irish man (same former 'colony' issues as you Yanks) who's based in the UK, point out that the largest population in the USA is of German origin and the second is Irish.  The closest vote in US Senate history was to vote your national language be German (lost by one vote) and it was the single most important factor in the USA staying out of WW2 for so long (apparently, I'm not sure I agree with that, nor am I here to start a American/Europe historical/factual dispute).  <p>Arguably it was the British who were being entrepreneurial then as, put in historical context, colonising countries was primarily for economic gain - Land equalled money then, through taxes.  We replaced the aristocracy with the government, which is now collecting the taxes instead.  When we created the government, the Aristocracy had to find new vehicles for wealth creation so the created 'Corporations', hence why all big trade missions were funded by entities like the 'Corporation of London'.  This gave the rich a way of passing wealth down the family without being taxed on it.  <p>The David / Goliath analogy is rather paradoxical as it is American companies that lead globalisation and are the largest in the world.  Google has a turnover in the BILLIONS; sorry that's not quite mom and pop corner store.....they are a goliath. But I am not here to give business lessons.  <p>Please allow me to try focusing this discussion.  I am interested in your brain/personality/experience.  I'm asking YOU, as individuals and Americans how you feel.  How does starting up make YOU feel?  I believe the answer lies in societal norms and, therefore, American attitudes.  This, I agree, has to do with historical trends.\n",1188586025

Bite the bullet and fix the project based either on you code or the current mess. (and shut up about things until you're done) Walk away once released.<p>3.

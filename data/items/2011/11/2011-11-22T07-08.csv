Android (at least the cyanogen mod kernel) has also the ability to use a part of the main memory to store compressed swap partition data. That leaves about 80 Megabytes to userspace programs (on Android). About the amount a normal desktop computer had in 1998.<p>LaTex dates back to the beginning of the 80s. Given that it has the ability to create large documents, I doubt that the required amount of main memory scales linearly with the size of the document.<p>Also, when you use subprocesses, besides checking their return value, you have some sort of interprocess communication which should detect when one process failed to finish his job.<p>It looks more like the smartphone runtimes and their sandboxes just don't support it at all, because modern GUI applications rarely build upon multiple executables in the background.",1321948139

You suggest that someone who uses Perl feels the need to use it everywhere, that it's more complex than shell tools, and that Perl somehow becomes a crack-like addiction, forcing you to never use command line tools again.<p>That's just plain silly.  There are tons of people who make heavy use Unix tools and Perl.  This isn't an either-or situation like you seem to be pushing.  They're all just tools for solving problems.  The smart thing is to recognize when each tool is appropriate, and then use them properly.<p>For example, the other day I was working with a log file.  Initially, I was beating on it with command line tools: find, grep, cut, sed, sort, uniq, wc, etc.  Eventually, I got what I needed out of it, but knew I was going to need something more to present to my team, so I pulled out awk, and I wrote a little script to extract the data and generate a simple report.  A few days later, management saw the report, and liked it.  But, they wanted some additional features added, and some changes to the processing.  I could have hacked what they wanted into the awk script, but the processing had gotten complex enough that I knew I was better off making the jump to Perl.  So, I rewrote it in Perl, and got everything they wanted.  Additionally, it had the flexibility with Perl that the next two feature requests that management made were implemented in just a few minutes each.<p>Also, in case you weren't aware of it, Perl integrates and happily makes use of external commands.  If there's a tool out there that will do some heavy lifting for you, Perl makes it trivial to call out to that command (just like backticks or $(/bin/foo) in bash).<p>If you really want to do complex scripting with Unix tools, then you're either limiting yourself to pretty trivial work, or you're making things a <i>lot</i> harder on yourself than they need to be.  Perl was created for a reason, and it's a good one.  Small scripts or glue to tie things together, use a shell script and Unix tools.  Complex scripts, use a real scripting language, make things easier on yourself, and get more work done in a faster, better way.",1321946338

I've tried asking companies to offer internships, but most have no concept of hiring below the journeyman level.<p>The bar has also been rising for entry-level experience in the rare cases these jobs are offered. Back in the 1990s, entry-level programmers were not expected to know SQL, HTML+Javascript, the LAMP stack, or how TCP/IP works. Now it is quietly expected that everybody knows all this, and except for SQL these skills are not taught at university. Students who do not pick up these skills on their own time will face an especially difficult time finding work.<p>All of the anecdotes I've heard of someone learning one language and getting a job in it involve hard-science postgrads and professors who already had very good analytical skills and were programming something related to their field of interest.

As for the presence of job opportunities, journeyman and senior positions each easily outnumber entry-level positions. Most companies do not hire at the entry level at all, and it is getting harder to find jobs that are slightly above the entry level in requiring only 2-4 years of experience rather than 4-6.

3264473,comment,3263846,3264383,6,0,DrPizza,,,"> This article is impressively bad.<p>Cheers!<p>> While the 8-module chip does share a few things (mainly a vector processing unit, that becomes two when doing the 128-bit SSE operations)<p>A few things? No, it shares a lot of things. The entire floating point and SIMD unit. The entire front-end. The branch predictor is, I believe, a weird hybrid of shared and non-shared. The I-cache, and the L2 cache, also both shared.<p>The front-end is particularly troublesome. The entire decoder can either service one thread or the other. If both threads need instructions, the best it can do is round robin between them. This averages to allow just two instructions per cycle: less decode bandwidth than K10.<p>Likewise the integer units: there are fewer ALUs and AGUs per thread than in K10. Likewise the floating point unit. There's lots of sharing, and even the private, non-shared parts are resource-starved.<p>> But, they'll have sse contention if they schedule more than 8 256-bit vector operations (sadly intel won't bring this instruction set to market for a bit).<p>SSE contention will occur if a thread can issue more than two SSE operations per cycle, or one AVX operation per cycle.<p>> Bulldozer is pretty cool, but sadly the tech press decides to shit on the underdog in a market that multiple companies have successfully sued the monopolist for anti-competitive behavior. :(<p>I don't care about ""the underdog"" or which is ""cool"" or which multi-billion dollar corporation you might prefer. I care about which works better. It ain't Bulldozer.",1321945416

It seems to happen to most software as it ages.<p>Putting it on a server makes the architecture more robust against messy code (and changes in programming languages and environments), because pieces can be changed independently.",1321945315

Though in the examples I've seen it wasn't clear if they were returning a class.<p>With raw numerical values the results are definitely unpredictable.  For example maybe the program considers numerical values to be measured in ounces, in which case ""2.2_lb"" becomes the <i>number</i> ""35.2""; or maybe it thinks everything is metric, measured in grams.  There is not just one reasonable way to pick a number to represent an expression.<p>I am fairly sure that a leading zero cannot be a problem with custom literals; I'd expect the compiler to parse the whole thing and see the suffix before deciding what type of literal it is (i.e. the ""_b"" handler would get to read everything raw, including the leading zero).",1321945269

Insurance drives up the cost and hides true costs from consumers.<p>[...]<p>The problem with this argument is that all the available evidence says exactly the opposite.  Private U.S. health-insurance exposes more of the cost of health care to the patient than any other first-world health system, and yet it's more expensive than any other first-world health system (including America's own socialist insurance scheme, Medicare).<p>Moreover, the trend over the last 30 years or so in private U.S. health insurance has been to increase the exposure of the patient to costs of care (i.e. we pay much more in deductibles and co-pays than Americans a generation ago did). The result has not been a decrease in health care inflation. Quite the contrary, actually.",1311090307

I keep offering him to get a new computer, cards, whatever, and he refuses because of the cost to him in terms of getting his environment set up 'just right' again - he's quite picky (at my previous workplace, a digital circuit designer on six figures didn't want to move from his PIII to a Core 2 for the same reason).<p>I've seen this before (and was guilty of this kind of thinking a few times) and I believe this is simply misguded. No matter how good of an ""old-school"" developer someone is, she needs to keep her tools fresh. To me this is no different than having a very manual build or deployment process (maybe not as bad but still).<p>I believe when it comes to HW + toolset for development, you simply must consider:<p>-Computers break - you need to be able to set up a new one in a matter of hours (or 10s of minutes). Maybe it does not need to be this drastic everywhere, but if your computer breaks and it takes you a few working days to get it just right - something is wrong - you need to automate it or reconsider the tools (which may not be always possible especially in embedded/hardware design world). If you get this right - upgrading will not be (such) a problem.<p>-You need to keep up with the tools - maybe more than you need to keep up with the libraries. With this I don't mean only the newest versions, but to constantly be on the lookout for the better alternatives - blogs, forums etc. there is simply no excuse for not doing this if you are a developer other than laziness. This will help you get rid of some stuff on your machine you don't actually need because you may end up with better alternatives. I am a firm believer in getting rid of clutter in your life.<p>Not all devs in all companies can follow these, of course, due to policies, the nature of work, ""legacy stuff"" and whatnot, but it helps a lot if you can, and point 2 means you are learning - so you are not bored.",1311088708

Here's ""how it works out"" for me.<p>I wrote code as fast on an Apple //c as on this late-2010 MacBook Pro 17"".  I'd argue faster, as context switching to something unproductive was actually a chore.  For writing, Appleworks 2 on the //c was, if anything, more efficient than the latest MS Word, for the same reasons some hardcore devs prefer EMACS over Visual Studio.<p>In my experience, the single most meaningful programming productivity boost in the past 25 years is a second screen.<p>Running PageMaker on an SE/30 with an external Radius Pivot, for example, ran productivity circles around working the built-in screen alone.<p>But before second screens, devs managed to get by. In the Apple II coding days, an Imagewriter printout of code thus far taped to the wall behind the monitor served as the ""second"" screen, and physical books lying open around the desk served as reference tools. In many ways, I'd argue the simplicity and thoughtfulness of that approach was more efficient.  It's as though the mind can keep separate threads for each type and physical location of media.<p>For horsepower, as the rest of the comments here point out, a team does want a source code and build system that screams, but each developer workstation could arguably be a text terminal provided it can handle a few windows.<p>The psychology of latest toys contributing to job satisfaction contributing to productivity is a separate argument. I <i>have</i> found giving dev groups machines tuned for LAN parties (latest graphics, high GHz CPUs) more relevant to productivity than providing machines tuned for compiling (striped raptor HDs, quad xeons).",1311088461

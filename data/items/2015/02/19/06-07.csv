9072806,comment,9070496,9071064,0,0,beagle3,,,"> Observe that asm.js is very verbose, define a simple binary bytecode for it.<p>I suspect that is never going to happen, for two reasons:<p>1) verbosity, on its own, does not make a difference on the web - HTML and Javascript are both generally super verbose, and haven&#x27;t had any accepted &quot;simple binary encoding&quot; designed for them in those 20 years. What does get implemented is minifiers and compressors (gzip encoding or otherwise), both of which will provide benefits to asm.js comparable to what a bytecode would, and would not require any buy-in from browser maker (the same attribute that has made asm.js successful and PNaCL unsuccessful so far).<p>2) Historically, anything that is not backwards compatible and does not degrade gracefully is NOT easily adopted by Browser makers, or by websites, unless it provides something that cannot be achieved without it (e.g. WebGL gets some adoption because there is no alternative; but ES6 will get little to non in the next 3 years except as a source language translated to ES5)",1424329123

The problem is that politicians have created a system where there is little or no incentive to do so.<p>Electricity is a heavily regulated sector.

Good questions!<p>The reason why our clients are choosing the &quot;all-in-one&quot; solution is because they are fed up with disjointed systems. Why shouldn&#x27;t their fundraising pages on the frontend automatically talk to their CRM on the backend? Our solution is integrated in the &quot;NGO&#x27;s website automatically&quot; as we are a complete white labelled solution powering the entire fundraising/crowdfunding/campaign-style experience on their own website.<p>The email marketing solution is something we&#x27;re still building out, and while still in the early stages we have integrated with some cool patent-pending technology that provides deep insights and analytics. We can gather data such as which subscribers have read the email, how many times, duration spent reading the content, on which device, location opened, whether or not they clicked through any links, and furthermore converted. All of this feeds back to our integrated CRM to further segment high value, highly engaged contacts.<p>Currently we use PayPal as our payment gateway because they were the only ones to offer a low NGO rate for our clients. Plus they have a long standing trust with nonprofits and donors, and most NGO&#x27;s already have a PayPal account with many using it as their donate button, making it an obvious choice.",1424328917

9072778,comment,9068656,9069233,0,0,ggreer,,,"A coincidence of units makes interstellar distances easy to visualize. One light-year is ≈63,240 AU. One mile is 63,360 inches. So if Earth was an inch from Sol, Alpha Centauri would be four miles away. Voyager probes would be 100-ish inches away, traveling about 3 inches per year.<p>This also gives you some idea of how tiny parallax[1] is. Parallax to Alpha Centauri is equivalent to looking at something four miles away and moving your head two inches. This is where the parsec comes from. If moving 1 AU causes an object to have an arc-second of parallax, that means it&#x27;s 3.26 light-years away. An arc-second is a tiny angle. There are 360 degrees in a circle, 60 arc-minutes in a degree, and 60 arc-seconds in an arc-minute. To give you another point of reference, an arc-minute would be about an inch separation at 100 yards. Current instruments can use parallax to measure distances up to 300 light-years. The Gaia mission should be able to measure angles as small as 20 millionths of an arc-second.[2]<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax</a><p>2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)</a>",1424328218

In other words, a treasury bond can be decomposed into a series of zero coupon cash flows (interest payments+principal re-payment).  The price of a &#x27;whole bond&#x27; is the sum of the prices of the different zero coupon cash flows.<p>A bond maturing in 30yrs has at least 10yrs of cash flows that line up with the 10yr bond.  Since coupon interest payments can be &#x27;stripped&#x27; from one bond and &#x27;reconstituted&#x27; in another bond through the federal reserve, the price of matched-maturity zero coupon cash flows, even if they are stripped from different bonds, is the same.  If they weren&#x27;t, there would be an arbitrage opportunity to buy the cash flows of one bond and sell the cash flows of another bond, exchange them at the Fed, and lock in an immediate profit.  Sometimes arbitrage opportunities like this do exist, but typically it&#x27;s due to liquidity events where it becomes impossible finance offsetting positions.

It is of utmost importance to rule out concurrent conditions, but it&#x27;s a fact that &quot;comorbidity is the rule, not the exception&quot;.  These other conditions like depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, etc., need to be addressed to <i>really</i> solve the problems.<p>> ADHD assessment takes at least few hours ...<p>That&#x27;s actually an understatement.  It may take weeks, months, even years to adequately understand a person&#x27;s experience and the nature of dysfunction.

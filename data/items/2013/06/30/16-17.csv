It is also the case that at any given time many of Harvard&#x27;s faculty (in particular) are on sabbatical, but most of those are unpaid sabbaticals. Ivy League profs often take time off to be visiting scholars at other institutions, or at the UN or IMF and such. But they don&#x27;t normally get paid for that; they take an unpaid sabbatical and are paid by the institution they visit, or by a research grant.<p>But in any case how much Ivy Leagues cost is hardly the main question of public interest; they could cost $80k for all I care.

5966262,comment,5964962,5965879,2,0,mjn,,,"That may be true at some universities, but certainly not all.<p>I&#x27;m most familiar with the University of California, where the state&#x27;s willingness to fund it has massively decreased, not only as a percentage subsidy but in terms of actual contribution. In 1975, the state contributed $29k towards each UC student; in 1985 it was $31k; in 1995 it was $23k; in 2005 it was $20k; and today it&#x27;s a mere $13k (all figures in 2012 dollars). That&#x27;s a decrease of about 55% in per-student funding: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/misc/uc_funding.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/misc/uc_funding.txt</a><p>Overall cost of the UC system, on the other hand, has actually slightly decreased on a per-student basis, but not nearly enough to cover that 55% funding cut. Therefore, tuition has gone up to cover it.<p>If you want to factor out the confounding factor that a larger percentage of students go to college, you can also look at it on the macro-level and ask, what percentage of the state&#x27;s resources do Californians choose to devote to funding higher education? That gives an indication of higher education as a public priority. And there it&#x27;s again a drop of a little over half: in 1975 the UC system&#x27;s funding equalled 0.3% of state GDP; today it equals 0.12% of state GDP. If funding were put back to 0.3% of state GDP (or even 0.25% or so), tuition could be cut almost to zero, so there is no real cost problem, just a no-longer-willing-to-fund problem.",1372609463

5966249,comment,5965789,5965789,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"The details behind the article show a less appealing reality than what we might hope for. Yeoman capitalism hasn&#x27;t killed off VC-istan just yet. A lot of these $1M/year businesses are for, say, independent real estate brokers. Yes, there are people who get very rich in that game. There are others who fail horribly. I think we&#x27;re quite a way from a society where talented people can find their way to, if not $1M per year, a reasonable approximation of their actual worth to society. (Fuck, I&#x27;d be happy with a regular upper-middle-class income if freed from subordination and its attendant mind-rot.)<p>Let&#x27;s stop talking about revenues and figures of &quot;$1 million per year&quot; (because there are a variety of context factors-- geography, profit vs. revenue-- that make us question what that really means) and instead talk about <i>growth</i>. This is where it gets interesting. We can look at the growth/risk spectrum between gambler&#x27;s ruin (take all nonnegative-expectancy risks; thus take over the world economy or die) and non-participation (take no risks; no growth above the risk-free rate-- minus management fees, of course). Most business activity is between those two extremes, but the very middle of that spectrum is underfunded and undersubscribed.<p>If you want to push for 150-percent-annual-growth-or-sudden-death outcomes like a sociopath gambling with others&#x27; money, ambitions, careers and dreams, then there are VCs will fund you, your pathological gambling, and (in most cases) your shitty personality cult. (That&#x27;s the high-risk, high-growth route.)<p>If you want to work for some horrible, authoritarian corporation doing shit-ass-boring mediocre work and growing your salary at 7% per year (mostly, a reward for <i>getting older</i> because you&#x27;re so disconnected from the real work that no one knows what you&#x27;re worth) then... good news, that is available too. (That&#x27;s the low-risk, low-growth route... except the long-term existential risks are pretty disgusting because a career of mediocrity, coupled with age, makes one untouchable. See: what fucking academia does to those who don&#x27;t make it.)<p>What no one is talking about is the mid-risk/mid-growth range... 20 to 40 percent annual growth with <i>some</i> volatility, but not likely to ruin lives <i>en masse</i>. (You might have a thin year, but your average outcome is strong if you work hard, have the talent, and do the right thing. You just need discipline in your strong years.) The problem is that <i>no one</i> is funding that region of the spectrum. But that&#x27;s the natural home for technology, research, science, as well as the yeoman capitalism that most of us would find much more rewarding (and scalable, and beneficial to society) than this VC-istan, Hollywood-for-ugly-people, bullshit.<p>You can get jobs at stagnant corporations and jobs (probably not founder jobs, unless you have the connections to partake in Stanford Welfare, but jobs with &quot;equity&quot;) in the high-risk VC-istan space. No one seems to have any clue how to fund the mid-risk/mid-growth space, but that&#x27;s where the future <i>actually</i> lives.

Gasoline had a similar one decades ago during the leaded to unleaded transition... that would have been the ideal time to roll diesel into the market.<p>Another problem is ignoring progress.  &quot;Those 1970&#x27;s diesels really sucked compared to 1970s gas engines&quot;.  &quot;Oh thats OK 2010 diesels are better than 1970s diesels.&quot;  &quot;Sorry dude I&#x27;m comparing a 2010 diesel with a 2010 gas engine, not a 1970 gas engine.&quot;  &quot;Oh... in that case I guess a gas engine is better&quot;.",1372608201

Within the UK, the BBC is only allowed to show content that is wholly funded by the license fee, and cannot solicit advertising or other external funding for the content. This was insisted on by the private-sector media companies, who don&#x27;t want the BBC competing with them in the commercial portion of the market.<p>Separately, the BBC overseas service is required to solicit external funding for its content, and <i>not</i> to cross-subsidize it with the license fee. This was insisted on by the government, which did not want license-fee revenues subsidizing international content, but still did want international content to exist as part of the UK&#x27;s global cultural export/image. But due to the previous agreement this content then can&#x27;t be shown in the UK, because it&#x27;s commercially-funded content.",1372608181

The only new accusation against these tech companies with the initial PRISM leak is that they were knowingly allowing the government to directly access their servers.  That is why they denied direct access, because they were accused of supplying direct access.  Just because Google and Facebook didn&#x27;t deny these new accusation before they were ever levied against them doesn&#x27;t mean they are automatically guilty of them.  Let&#x27;s wait to see how things play out before we starting making judgements.",1372608158

One of my favorite vehicles I&#x27;ve owned was a diesel Toyota Hilux; also loved the Land Cruiser LM78 I borrowed.<p>The main thing I want is the ability to store 500-1000 gallons of fuel and know it will be viable for a couple years.  You can do that with diesel, you can&#x27;t really do that with gasoline.

If you need your car, and you can&#x27;t afford to buy a new engine if it breaks, as far as I can tell you&#x27;d be certainly well advised not run a modern diesel car without a warranty. I don&#x27;t know anybody who&#x27;s owned one who hasn&#x27;t had various funny problems with it, requiring regular trips to the garage followed by shrugging shoulders all round and a succession of replacement of random electronic parts.<p>To meet the increasingly stringent emissions controls, and people&#x27;s desire for a car that is reasonably cheap and accelerates at a decent rate, the cars seem to have become rather complicated, and reliability has been affected.<p>Common points of failure seem to be:<p>- dual mass flywheel (presumably the regular swift ramping-up of torque doesn&#x27;t help)<p>- turbo charger (obviously spins very quickly and unlike a petrol engine it comes on from about 1500rpm so it&#x27;s used a lot)<p>- diesel injectors (high precision components operating under pressure)<p>- diesel particulate filter (can clog and require expensive replacement if car is not regularly driven hard)<p>- random engine/ECU &quot;thing&quot; that nobody can figure out (who knows what the root cause of this might be)<p>You might have better luck with a pre-common rail diesel car, but the fuel economy is unlikely to be very good and the performance - at least by modern standards - looks to be terrible.",1372608024

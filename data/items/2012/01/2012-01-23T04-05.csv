Me-too'ers and yes-men are too agreeable, but still on topic. I wonder if it's possible to analyze a paragraph for agreeableness and automatically reduce its visibility if it's too extreme on either end. That might force people to post a more balanced view (assuming that the people gaming the system are down-voted by human moderators).<p>This actually seems like something a machine could reasonably do. Agreeableness is vague enough that it wouldn't need domain knowledge of the conversation, and there are probably enough key words and phrases to train it.<p>I wonder what effect that would have?",1327294766

One of the problems for BIG infrastructure (say, hospitals and apartment buildings), is that they often have their peak demand almost instantaneously in the morning - often before the sun comes up.  For solar, that means you can't directly address this peak demand without some way of shifting that generation capacity.  But, as you say, unlike some of the arguments over the years trying to prove that solar is untenable, I think it's predictability, combined with additional advances elsewhere, will indeed push us toward a better future, at least until that ""fusion"" stuff gets around to being feasible :)",1327294658

My favorite quote:<p><i>A novel is usually much, much too long to adapt to a film, with too many characters, too many parts. When you first read the novel, put good notes in it the first time, right on the book, write down everything you feel, underline every sensation that you felt was strong. Those first notes are very valuable. Then, when you finish the book, you will see that some pages are filled with underlined notes and some are blank.</i><p><i>In theatre, theres something called a prompt book. The prompt book is what the stage manager has, usually a loose-leaf book with all the lighting cues. I make a prompt book out of the novel. I break the novel, and I glue the pages in a loose-leaf, usually with the square cutout so I can see both sides.</i><p><i>In the case of Apocalypse, there was a script written by the great John Milius, but, I must say, what I really made the film from was the little green copy of Heart of Darkness that I had done all those lines in. Whenever I would do a scene, I would check that and see what can I give the movie from Conrad.</i>",1327294555

What did we do for fun 700 years ago? How about 5,000? If there was no Hollywood, what would we do for fun 20 years from now? Don't assume the internet or video games will play a part, even though they may. Don't box yourself into that corner yet. Don't assume it means replacing movies with more movies.<p>Here are just some examples from the sports world that take us out of our element and, for many fans, create mania: FIFA World Cup. The Tour de France. The Superbowl. The Indy 500. Formula One. The Kentucky Derby. Dakar Rally. Cricket World Cup. Wimbledon. French Open. The Masters Tournament. The PGA Championship.<p>And please don't look at it from the ticketing perspective. I know that sports ticketing is as much of a scam as Hollywood. The point is, how would you create something that excites that mania in people?<p>Don't limit yourself to something YC would fund, either. Perhaps the internet startup will be dead in 20 years.

* Write a bestselling novel that is optioned by Hollywood and that, by the very creation and production of the film, signals the end of Hollywood, such that Hollywood has no choice but to eat itself.

I'm in the second wave of new hires, working as an architect on the software system that will be managing the scale of the infrastructure as we build out.  That said, my knowledge is obviously fairly specific to the software, and the hardware bit that I've come to understand is primarily through osmosis :) To try and answer what I can without violating the usual secret squirrel stuff:<p>Efficient infrastructure - we're able to charge and discharge at a high level of input to output efficiency. Typically, in the energy storage business, you lose a lot of energy via inverters and other technology.  Our secret sauce gets around a lot of this, though I don't think I'm able to disclose exactly how it works.  It's incredibly elegant in it's simplicity though, and can plug directly into the wild west of the grid.  We're also able to network together a significant amount of capacity in almost any configuration for a very reasonable cost per KW.  That means we can take our storage system and sell you 80kw/h discharged over 4 hours (20kw per hour), or 40kw over 2 hours, or just keep adding capacity to change those numbers further.  While we're a bit young to be just ""plug and play"", we'll get there as time goes by.<p>In terms of battery technology, we have a few tricks up our sleeves and are working with a variety of researchers, but for the most part we just work with what's on the market - meaning high end lead acid (best bang for the buck, and the maintenance story is improving), and lithium ion where people want it.  This helps keep purchase and maintenance costs low, but we've also built our own battery management system that lets us plug and play any battery tech on the market today, as well as several that are on the way but haven't hit a decent economy of scale yet.<p>I can't comment on specifics of the BMS, other than we're building the hardware as well as the software, which lets us play with a variety of models for handling battery input and output.<p>It's a market that's seeing plenty of entries and new competition every day, but it's also really cool to see how people are approaching the problem and working with partners to drive the cost of energy down.

Since we're (sortof) making a 'in a perfect world' wishlist, I think we can do better than fall into the same traps that current law/lawmakers/our assorted predecessors fell into, criminalizing behavior that is entirely or mostly harmless and where enforcement has minimal benefits.<p>With your other examples, I think that there is a case to be made on both sides with regards to the dangers vs the benefits from enforcement. But with those cases,  I can more clearly see the arguments that enforcement has benefits that are worth the difficulty (depending on how damaging you think pot, gambling, and car accidents are). So I could see where a person would argue that noncommercial fanwork is severely enough damaging to the creator/rights holder to make enforcement worth it, but I personally don't see it as such and would have a very hard time believing such arguments without strong proof. Car accidents where someone is not wearing a seatbelt, on the other hand, has pretty demonstrable damages.<p>(I'm not really going to get into pot or gambling, because I think ath this point, the arguments for and against pot criminalization are well-established, and starting to weight every-so-slightly toward decriminalization, and I personally find gambling distasteful and boring and don't have the energy to read up on the damages associated with gambling or the benefits associated with enforcement of anti-gambling laws.)",1327294067

The differences between the two can be summarized by ""scale"" and ""intent.""<p>In terms of scale, Dreamworks was designed to compete directly with the majors.  They focused on tentpole pictures produced at Big Six scale.  Even with their substantial financial backing, this meant that a single flop could (and did) jeopardize their company.  Corman's films, on the other hand, with their minuscule budgets needed only draw a fraction of the business of a Dreamworks release to make a profit and so very rarely (if ever) showed up as a ""loss"" on his books.  Corman's films rarely hit it big, but because of their relative costs, they never had to. Modest returns were sufficient for him to draw profit margins astronomically beyond those of the majors.<p>In terms of intent, Dreamworks was set up primarily to produce and release the films of its founders, who tended to trade in prestige films, and their desire to produce only Oscar-level films tended to paralyze their production ability; excessively high standards ruined them.  When they did get a film off the ground, they tended to bet too large (out of desperation) and lost as frequently as they won.  The exact same thing happened to Coppola's Zoetrope when he let himself run amok on One From the Heart.<p>The lesson from Dreamworks (and Zoetrope) is to manage your risk.  Never put yourself in a position where a single failed project can ruin you.  Similarly, never produce a film that requires broad mass market success to avoid total financial failure.",1327293730

They want people to either abstain from using their product (not ideal) or pay them for the use of it.  This is what every business on the planet wants.<p>Instead, they invest billions of dollars making things that are in massive demand.  They employ millions of people whose livelihoods depend on these products getting a return.  They have a moral and legal obligation to protect the interests of their investors and their employees.  Although 10 million illegal downloads is not 10 million legal sales lost, it is, without a doubt, <i>some</i> sales lost, and there are many billions of illegal downloads annually.  These companies have moral and legal obligations to push for better enforcement against this illegal activity.  And they do not have the answer to how to go about that effectively without causing problems in the process.  It does not make them malicious people by default.  Everyone on this forum knows that there is no perfect solution, and maybe it is a pointless pursuit, but it is just silly to act as if this massive industry, lead by people who feel every bit as responsible for their employees' families having food on their table as any other company's leaders, is supposed to just sit there and watch people illegally take their product without paying for it and do nothing.<p>Yes, we all want to make sure legislation like SOPA does not pass.  But declaring a war on them is not going to help find amicable solutions.  Saying you do not like their proposed solutions and then going back to business as usual, not proactively joining the conversation for how to reduce piracy, is not doing anything at all to keep the internet safe from the flawed solutions that they will continue to propose out of obligation to their shareholders and employees.<p>If you really want to protect the internet, the two best things you can do are stop pirating things you didn't pay for, and start contributing ideas and solutions to the issue of piracy that have as few unintended consequences as possible.",1327293701

""Negotiating with the decisionmaker will cost me this offer, so don't negotiate"" is something which is only really believed by engineers who are -- and I say this with love -- abominably incompetent at negotiation.  This is regrettable, since skill at negotiation matters a whole heck of a lot more than skill with Chef or mastery of Postgres trivia for determining both the instant results of the negotiation and one's larger career trajectory.<p>Still working on that blog post on negotiation, should be up early Monday for more elaboration on this.",1327291494

3498969,comment,3498689,3498885,5,0,botolo,,,"You totally got the point of my post and my experiment! I created the experiment after reading one of my friends' reaction to the Filesonic decision about stopping file sharing. He posted on his Facebook account that this was the end of piracy. But as Pash correctly states, as long as content is digital, it's just a bunch of ones and zeroes and the usenet experience teaches us that any file could be easily translated in words and posted anywhere, including blogging platforms.<p>Using Twitter was just a provocative way of analyzing the issue, given that the experiment was deeply interesting also under the light of DMCA, as another user suggested. I was thinking what would happen if people started ""infesting"" legit websites such as Twitter or other blogging platforms with copyright protected content under the form of Mime64 messages or using any other encoding method which translates a file in text. While posting a link to a copyright protected file would justify a DMCA takedown notice, the problem would be bigger if the file would be hosted (under the form of Mime64 tweets) by the blogging platform itself.<p>Let's make it even more complex. What if tweets or blog posts would be posted randomly (not just by one user) and links to all these tweets or posts would be collected in a small document, something similar to a .nzb file? Could Twitter or any other blogging platform refuse a DMCA takedown notice for messages which are harmless by themselves and which are a violation of a copyrighted work only if collected together following the list of files contained in the .nzb-look-a-like file (which may be hosted somewhere else)? This would be a general counsel's nightmare.<p>In conclusion, the fight against piracy is the classic mouse-cat fight...piracy will never die and the only way to bypass this is to come up with a new business model for content providers and copyright holders.<p>I know that Paul Graham recently launched the idea of ""killing Hollywood"" by creating a new business model for content distribution. I think this idea should even be broader and should be about ""how to kill piracy"" by removing the fundamentals of pirates (which is, I think, sharing, avoid paying premium prices, etc.) by creating a new business model or method for content delivery and fee collection for content utilization.<p>Thanks everyone for the great comments that you posted so far.",1327291464
3498968,comment,3498000,3498000,5,0,tzs,,,"Yes. A large part of it is size. It's hard to discuss this without sounding like an elitist or a stuck up braggart, but that is not my intent. I'm also going to use Reddit for comparison, and it might sound like I'm slamming Reddit, but I am not. I've been there for over four years, and spend a lot of time there (way too much time). If it helps, while I am typing this I'm kind of watching and listening to ""Finding Bigfoot"" on Animal Planet. I think admitting that should prove I have no illusion that I'm superior...<p>I'm a reasonably bright person. On objective tests that are usually considered reasonably good indications of intelligence, I do reasonably well (99.6 percentile on the LSAT for instance). I managed to get a bachelor's degree in mathematics from a tough school (Caltech).<p>I find I prefer spending time, in real life or in virtual life, in the company of other bright people. In fact, I'm happiest when I'm generally outclassed by the people around me, but they are not so far ahead of me that I cannot understand what they are saying and make valuable contributions of my own. I do not like to be one of the smartest people in the room (real or virtual).<p>Reddit, at least the technical groups I had frequented when I signed up there over four years ago, was like that. But now those groups have 500k to 1 million or more readers. Just doing the math, you can't put together a group on an open forum like Reddit that is that big and still has enough smart people for me to be comfortably away from the top.<p>Such large groups tend to have many people who can't distinguish on their own between someone advocating a repellant position, and someone disagreeing with a flawed argument against a repellant position. It gets frustrating when someone says something, especially when they are advocating a position you actually agree with, that turns out to have some factual flaw, and then you spend 20 or 30 minutes working on a reply, and then you are massively down voted. On a lot of subreddits now I have stopped researching my comments--I just go from memory. If someone wants more information, or citations, they can use my comment for ideas to start their Google search.<p>HN when I signed up, a little under two years ago, was ideal. Nearly everyone seemed at least as smart as me, and I started recognizing a lot of people clearly my superior. It was like being back at Caltech. A down vote on HN actually meant something--if a comment of mine got a down vote it invariably meant I had done something really dumb and I'd learn from it.<p>And on HN you could post a devil's advocate argument without having to first explain that you are playing devil's advocate. You could take a contrary position just to get a good argument, and people would welcome it as long as your point was well written and logical.<p>As HN grows, it invariable is going to become more Reddit-like, but that behavior is more damaging here. Reddit has subreddits. You can skip the cesspools of stupidity like /r/politics and /r/atheism (my vote for the most disappointing subreddit) and at least get some good stuff in /r/programming (one of the few reddits to stay mostly reasonable despite growth) or /r/physics or /r/math.<p>HN doesn't separate things.<p>I'm using an add-on to inject custom CSS on the site, and I use that to highlight down voted comments in bright red so they stand out. I up vote any such comment if I can't see a good reason for the down vote. I've been finding lately that I have been up voting 90% of these comments. I up vote these even if I think the opinion in the comment is completely wrong, as long as it is expressed well and respectfully.<p>I don't know if this decline can be stopped, or if it is inevitable fate of every public discussion forum. One thing we can do is back off on things where they are adequately covered on Reddit <i>AND</i> the Reddit discussion is as good as the HN discussion. I've taken to flagging most of the political submissions unless something stands out to distinguish them. I've avoided this for a while, but in almost all of the discussion I've not seen any sign that the discussion here is better than that on Reddit.<p>Recall the advice from the HN guidelines:<p>-------------------------------------<p>On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.<p>Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.<p>-------------------------------------<p>Perhaps these could be tweaked a little. For the ""Off-Topic"", maybe ""on TV news"" could be expanded to ""on TV news or on a large subreddit"".<p>Again, sorry if any of this sounds elitist.<p>PS: they did not find Bigfoot.",1327291462

The scale of the Internet business is such that things like open source are thriving; this idea might as well have good chances to live and grow.  <p>Finally, people are different and have different needs, this may very well work for some folks.",1185976327

38347,comment,38028,38028,0,0,samb,,,"in 2000 i was moving around a bunch. everything i owned had to fit in the back of my station wagon. that included bed, furniture, musical instruments, computers, books, etc.<p>i slept on an inflatable mattress for several years. i also lived in a walk-in closet for 6 months. all those things were actually really good. it was an exciting time. living in a closet added to the subversion factor. i was invisible.<p>with marriage came the consolidation of things, and wedding presents, and now i'm one of the people with a garage full of stuff. strange things. not useful things. bags full of old hammers. children's things that we're saving. the good silverware. a desk that's too big to go in the house.<p>we live in a large-ish 3 bedroom house and i only spend time in a closet/office, the bathroom, the bedroom, the deck, and the kitchen. i have no use for 800-1000 square feet of my home. but the kids like it.<p>it's still a very exciting time, but there's lots of stuff. marriage is compromise, and stuff can be a part of that compromise. we have 2 gravy boats. one for everyday gravy and one for special gravy. of course, we only have gravy once every few years. but that's ok. i still work in a closet. somewhat invisible.",1185976066

This is because they have both the craft and the vision - these are critical components for success. <p>Rokhyakebe in your suggested model marketers will have the vision and not the craft and programmers will have the craft and not the vision.",1185975741

38341,comment,37881,38052,0,0,koolmoe,,,"""The article mistakes more ideas for better ideas.""<p>Most often, the immediate goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many ideas as possible.  Leaders of brainstorming sessions often start by encouraging wild ideas and discouraging the ""pruning"" that you speak of.  In that sense, the number of ideas generated is a logical measuring stick.<p>The goal is usually to hit an outlier, not come out with the best solution on average.  If that is the case, it's better to have more ideas, even if the median idea is worse than the median idea generated by a group.<p>",1185975359

38331,comment,38065,38302,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I admit I was joking a bit about the ""getting older"" and ""taking longer"" part.  Had I played more extensively with gmail earlier, I would have switched right when it was possible to keep your domain, which I think has only been possible for a few months now.  So I think a lack of knowledge about gmail played a bigger role than age.  To the extent that adapting to new contexts is a reflection of ""age"", I am a very young person.  (After using gmail for 1 day with my startup's streamfocus.com domain, I switched my whole architectural firm over)<p>As far as the age issue, in the sense that you're talking about, I've met many 20 somethings who acted ""older"" than me.  I have always been a risk taker, an optimist, a person constantly learning to improve, and many people aren't.  This is not an age issue, but an outlook on life issue.",1185973582

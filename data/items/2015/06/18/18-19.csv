You can use this technique to write a code coverage tool in Smalltalk. (Grab the source code of a method, apply parser-transformations, compile an instrumented version, swap the bytecode of the original method with the instrumented one. Make the instrumented method know how to swap itself back when everything is triggered.) A typical developer can write such a tool and have it become functional in one or two days. An exceptional one can do it in hours.<p>Iterating more produces more innovative applications and software tools. This is why fast compiles and parser tools are a winning combination.",1434653708

In a nation this large with so many different wealth levels, a non-progressive tax is just asinine.

Starting with a datastore from the beginning would also have worked, but it just wasn’t necessary at the beginning of the project.<p>My current setup:\n	Python’s Beautiful Soup + CasperJS for scripting (which is done)\n	Node, relying primarily on the excellent NLP package “natural,” for analysis\n	Bash to tie things together\n	My personal MBP as the environment<p>SO given the advice expressed in the thread (and despite my love of Shiny New Things), a combination of shell scripts and awk (a CL language specifically for structured text files!), which I had heard about before but thought was a networking tool, will probably work best, backed up by a 1TB or similar external drive, which I could use anyway (and would be more secure).

Most other systems lead to stupid incentives, unjust inequality, and over priced accountants.<p>For example. Assume a household of two people. one earns $20k per year, the other earns $80k per year. With a 50% tax and a $10k (after tax) per year basic income you get the following:<p><pre><code>    2*$10k + 0.5 * ($20k + $80k) = $70k\n</code></pre>\nNow if each partner earned the same you would get:<p><pre><code>    2*$10k + 0.5 * ($50k + $50k) = $70k\n</code></pre>\nWhich is exactly what you want. The problem with income splitting measure that try to replicate this is that they lead to a perverse disincentive to divorce. So in the first example, the person earning $80k would no longer be able to offload part of his income to the lower paying person, and the two persons effective income decreases just when their expenses double. Furthermore it discriminates against people that are single, which is politically expedient, but unjust.<p>It also solves the welfare and old age security paperwork problem. There are some other problems: like having a higher tax rate to pay for all this basic income, but ultimately I think it would unleash more minds on problems that matter instead of setting up family trusts for the wealthy.",1434653174

He agrees that the first $50,000 for a family of four shouldn&#x27;t be taxed. That&#x27;s a <i>progressive tax plan.</i> And it makes sense right - up to a certain amount of income, one makes so little money that need a bit more help than others to get by. Makes sense...but then you could logically assert the converse - that those making so much money need far less help than others to get by, and therefore could be taxed more without affecting their lifestyles.<p>And this is why a progressive tax plan works in the United States - there exists an income level based on the cost of consumer staples, housing, and transportation, that allows one to be a productive member of society. And so the further away from you get from that magic number (or delta of that number), the more that taxes have an effect either on the individual or the community as a whole. A family cannot get by on $1 a year. A billionaire simply does not need a billion dollars. The burden on them is far different - which is why their tax burden should reflect that.",1434652943

I&#x27;d think that any Republican politician with an understanding of economics would have to believe that a president&#x27;s policies are at best contributory rather than a distinct cause.  I get it as messaging; if one believes that progressive taxation has side effects that cause inequality, then they&#x27;d want to gloss over things to blame the presidency for it.  So, I tend to believe that most politicians have private meetings where they talk about what they actually think is going on, and then translate it into brain-deadening messaging for the public.  But sometimes I wonder if for a lot of these politicians, how much of what they say is actually because of willful ignorance rather than messaging.<p>Like that guy with the snowball that argued against global warming, that almost definitely has to be chutzpah rather than stupidity, right?  Like, he would understand the concept that just because a stock price spikes down, it could still be true that the stock market is going up over time.

Do you outsource (sub-contract) the work?\n\n    - Where are your developers based? This is an important question because if their team is remote the time estimates they give you usually do not take that into account. Its a common mistake.\n\n    - What is your development process? If they mention agile, scrum, etc., ask them to describe exactly what it is while speaking to you. Dont let them re-group and come up with an answer. Don&#x27;t let them formulate answers. Make sure to ask questions that have to be answered right there (on the phone or in front of you).\n\n</code></pre>\n- From PM point of view, how do you manage something like this?<p>You appoint a PM that is in charge of making sure that every milestone and deliverable is done.

Clever, and insightful - we go through very difficult and interesting problems that are often unrelated to the job.<p>I disagree a bit with the center pane, though (with the dog typing loops and the caption &quot;I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing&quot;).  It is, in my opinion, very impressive to be able to find the largest sum of all square matrices in an NxN matrix at a whiteboard in 45 minutes.  It&#x27;s impressive enough (especially not knowing the exact question in advance) to be a positive indicator of the ability to do what is in pane 3, especially considering how many variables and logical basket weaving is often involved in moving some text a few pixels to the right.  As long as you are willing to tolerate a very high false negative rate, this could be a good way to go.<p>Unfortunately, it does mean that most developers looking for jobs will need to intensely study data structures and algorithms, and walk around with them loaded in &quot;exam ready&quot; memory&quot; in a way that few people would need to simply to do their jobs.  Personally, I&#x27;d say most people would retain this mental state anywhere from 1-3 weeks after a college algorithms course, provided they were a good student who understood the material.  And it also means that lots of developers who could absolutely do this if they were willing to drop everything to study 50 or so hours and train at a white board will not be hired because they were more interested in just doing their jobs (which, ironically, is what they&#x27;d be doing at the new job).  So we are going through a very inefficient re-taking of exams every time we interview.  So I&#x27;m not surprised that some people have decided to stop interviewing, or just give up on finding a job that requires this sort of interview.<p>It&#x27;s up to a company to decide if they want to give up on hiring these developers, or to tolerate this kind of false negative rate.  However I have close to zero interest in hearing about how hard it is to hire good developers if this is their approach, since it suggests to me that the aren&#x27;t going to make any effort to find a way to avoid these false negatives.",1434652165

I didn&#x27;t understand what DHH was saying about design damage inflicted by testing until I started seriously confronting questions like &quot;which parts of this API should I mock and which parts should I just use integration tests for?&quot;<p>Eventually you spend more time thinking about testing than you do actually getting shit done. You have to because otherwise you find yourself rewriting tests every time you refactor. You rationalize this time under the guise of &quot;it&#x27;s making me think more clearly about my design.&quot; Once it starts wearing thin disillusionment takes root. The first step towards my own enlightenment was when I realized that I needed tests to help me ensure that my test framework was working. What&#x27;s testing those tests? Tests are code, and code needs to be tested. Where does it end?<p>I wrote my own toy test framework as an exercise. I was trying to * really * wrap my head around meta-programming, so I meta-programmed my test suite to test the heavily meta-programmed data classes. It solidified into a grotesque mush and I scrapped the whole thing. Now I&#x27;m solving the original problem with boring old Rails and sanity has been restored.<p>Now when I start a project I do it knowing that my code is going to suck and I&#x27;m going to refactor it over time. The truth is, when there&#x27;s no tests I only have to refactor one code base and not two. I don&#x27;t need to learn two frameworks. I don&#x27;t need to understand two domains. The amount of time I&#x27;ve spent maintaining code has sharply diminished after I stopped being so religious about testing. If I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing, the REPL is my best friend. Backtraces rule.<p>If your code is Serious Business, like, say, SQLite which is used everywhere, a robust test suite is a very nice tool to have and maintain. For everyone else, it&#x27;s another step on the road to mastery.<p>Also if you&#x27;re using a dangerously unsafe language like C, tests can alert you to brewing problems. If you&#x27;re using a safe language solving not-so-hard problems, a test framework is just adding complexity to paper over your lack of experience.",1434651876

Did you check the links on India and Turkey? Facebook released &quot;some information&quot; (which is terrifying if you consider what Facebook collects) about 3470+ accounts. Now, if you consider that some of these accounts are organizations and not individuals, they may have actually released the information regarding tens of thousands of people. Do you know what happens to these people once they are identified? Informal governmental blacklisting, for example, is very common in Turkey if you are critical of government discourses. Who are these users? Why was their information released? How much of it was released? What was the government&#x27;s reason? Was it investigated by Facebook?

What is the mechanism by which Facebook&#x27;s definition is not clouded by the same prejudice (and against a umber of groups) that clouds yours against incarcerated people?<p>> It is also reasonable for Facebook not to report this data as it is essentially private information about the inmates and their use of Facebook.<p>This is an offtopic non-argument. The linked article does not request that people be individually identified in these reports.

If you buy, you pay rent to the bank (principal and interest) for 30 years and rent to the government (property taxes) forever. You also pay utilities and insurance, maintenance and improvements. Homeowners tend to spend money on renovations and stuff, which is a hidden cost.<p>Then there is the psychological cost of ownership, which to me is a mental burden knowing I have debt.<p>The way I see it, there&#x27;s no such thing as ownership. You&#x27;re always paying someone. Suppose you own your house free and clear - can you paint your house pink? Can you have a collection of junk cars on your front lawn? (The neighbors will complain.)

This is a comparison of like-for-like housing units. Check your local market, what can you rent an entire house for? What&#x27;s the mortgage for buying a similar house look like?<p>One thing renters often don&#x27;t understand when making claims about the personal expenses buyers have to go through to maintain their property is that renters <i>are</i> paying for those things, it&#x27;s simply amortized over the period the property is up for rent. The money has to come from somewhere, and it comes from the renters.<p>When a renter moves, there is $0 from their rent that they are able to capture and move forward to their next property. While an owner can sell their previous property and carry forward their equity. To make an analogy, it would be like a renter being able to turn a $1000/mo rent into a $500/mo rent simply by having paid all the rent on-time at their previous place. This doesn&#x27;t happen with renting, but it happens with buying, where a buyer can carry equity from a previous home into the purchase of a new one and turn a $500,000 loan into a $250,000 loan (assuming the equity they&#x27;re carrying forward is worth 50% of the loan amount).<p>The length of time you will live at a place is also unimportant. You <i>always</i> need to live somewhere. Suppose I need to start housing myself at 20 and die at 90. I need to sort out shelter for 70 years. By buying a place you pay for it for 30, then get it for &quot;free&quot; (minus taxes and maintenance) for 40 years. With renting, you pay for shelter for all 70 years.<p>You can also rent out your property and make somebody else pay for it. Or rent out part of it for the same. In most rental markets, you can individually rent bedrooms for a total that exceeds the single unit rental price for the entire property.<p>What about markets where the rental fee is lower than the mortgage + taxes + maintenance? The property owner probably bought the property when property prices where lower, or owns it outright or is expecting to capture the delta when selling the property.<p>But rent here is so much lower than owning? For how long? If you purchase a home now, your 30 year mortgage will cost you the same per month for 30 years (or less if you pay off principal early). Thus a $2000/mo mortgage today will cost $2000/mo in 30 years. While rent only goes up -- usually with inflation. It&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ll be making more money in 30 years, so while renters will continue to pay the same share of income on rent, owners will not, their share of income for shelter <i>decreases</i> over time.<p>The local property market has to be extremely strange for decades for buying to ever be a worse idea than renting over the long-run. There are some advantages to renting, but they&#x27;re very rarely, if ever, financial over the long-term.",1434650758

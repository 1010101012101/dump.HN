2510986,comment,2510212,2510212,1,0,hristov,,,"This seems a like a faulty argument to me. Those are not our only two choices. Sure coal is really really bad. But that does not mean that nuclear is our only alternative.<p>Currently solar power is getting much cheaper and more practical. Same thing with wind power. We also have a natural gas which recently has been getting cheaper as large new discoveries are being made.<p>Natural gas is still a fossil fuel but it is much much cleaner than coal both in terms of health pollutants and in terms of CO2. There are some issues with natural gas extraction, but even if the various environmentally damaging methods of mining the stuff get banned as they should, we still have plenty of natural gas from new discoveries to last us for the foreseeable future.<p>Thus, we can use natural gas while solar and wind catch up price wise, which will happen sooner than we think. Solar especially is improving faster than anyone thought. Then we can still use natural gas for occasions where solar and wind aren't working.<p>So the coal/nuclear argument is a false dichotomy. We can have neither. Of course we should run the current nuclear plants until the end of their lives, but there is no reason to build new ones unless some revolutionary technology that makes everything much safer emerges. I would say the only new nuclear plants we should build are ones that burn the waste of the old ones, because those would technically make things safer by removing waste.",1304445578

They are not illusory damages; _someone_ will be made less than whole if the thief is not expected to provide compensation. And, no, I don't expect her to pay it back. But it is her obligation to make whole those she has wronged. Doing otherwise is neither reasonable nor fair.<p>Keyword: damages.  Damages are not the same thing as missing out on an opportunity for profit through means of extortion.<p>Sure, she should pay for her damages caused to Telstra--they just need to give her an itemized receipt of expenses that she caused the company.  This might include the amortized cost of hardware, maintenance, support staff, etc.  However, these costs would certainly not include Telstra's insane profit margins.  The purpose of most legal systems (Australia's too, I hope) is to maintain justice, not to serve as an alternative means of doing business.  Somehow, I think Telstra might come up with a slightly smaller figure than 193k if required to itemize their damages.",1304445248

It's a theoretical explanation of why moral hazard induced by insurance <i>may</i> not be inefficient.<p>A more interesting assumption made by this theoretical argument is that it measures efficiently a bit differently than most arguments on health care.

I'm hoping they bring in more features from the Slicehost control panel, and the migrations will be nothing more than moving images around on their backend (Yeah, right).

This was one of the best features for Slicehost, allowing independent contractors to push out a site, but have billing done through the site owners. Domain names isn't an issue for me (I use DNSMadeEasy) but I can see how it would be a bigger deal later.<p>Lesser features -- Slicehost has several kernel versions available.

If you listen carefully to budget proposals there are always a lot of money allocated on ""clean coal"" research.<p>Unfortunately, it all goes nowhere because there is no way to make it safe. Burning stuff is an old and well understood process, there is just no way to burn stuff in a radically different way. You can use filters of course but the coal pollutants are so small and the smoke is so much filtering gets too expensive. Coal plants do have filters but they do not catch many of the thousands of pollutants that result from burning coal. And filtering cannot take away the CO2 gas.<p>So our only option is to trap the gas underground, which is pretty much impossible. Thus, safe coal becomes a mirage that is always a couple of years away but you can never get to.<p>It is clear that we spend less money on safe coal than we do on nuclear. Nuclear receives enormous amounts of subsidies. Most of the budget of the DoE is devoted to nuclear in one way or another. But it is pretty clear that even if we spent more money on coal it would not get us anywhere.",1304444656

2510913,comment,2509786,2510832,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"What is ""excessive"" meditation? People die after playing video games for 16 hours, but no one is going to argue that playing them for a couple hours a day is physically dangerous.<p>I generally think the ""meditation sickness"" is more scare than substance, without much evidence for a causative link, but I think it's possible in certain circumstances. For example, I've heard of inexperienced people (i.e. people who've taken one hatha yoga class) going on week-long retreats and having negative experiences (including temporary psychosis and anxiety disorders) but that's not what I'm talking about. That's about as irresponsible as for an overweight person who can barely walk a mile to try out for a marathon.<p>I think that a lot of ""meditation sickness"" comes from people who are prodromal of some sort of psychological crisis and (because of their increasingly difficult mental state) become interested in altering their consciousness, and that the psychotic break was not caused by the meditation but would have happened anyway. I can't prove that, but it's been my suspicion for a long time. For those who might argue that meditation is therefore bunk because some people who meditate end up getting frank mental illness anyway, my counterpoint would be that it's foolish to expect that a novice meditator can meditate his way out of a potentially physical mental illness; he needs medical help.<p>What <i>is</i> very dangerous is when people try to use meditation or yoga in lieu of other well-tested, scientific medical treatment, which some New Age types believe in even though most actual meditators and yogis advise strongly against it. I talked to a very accomplished yoga teacher about using meditation to treat panic disorder (didn't want to use benzos) and he said, ""Meditate, but see a doctor and take his advice. You can't meditate your way out of this, right now, any more than a person with heart disease can meditate out of that.""",1304444546

A lot of other people have really good ideas when they are high, and those ideas are still really good while sober.<p>Part of this is that normally when you have an insight while sober, there is a unique feeling of pleasure you get in your brain. This is because part of the way we identify when we've had an insight is when we get this feeling. However, when we're high we get this feeling much more easily, even if what we're thinking about isn't actually at all insightful. Thus you need to sort of reteach yourself how to think and evaluate the quality of your ideas in a way that isn't reliant on whether or not something 'feels' insightful.<p>It's a big step once you can divorce the depth of insight from the intensity of the eureka feeling.

I'm sorry to hear that you've had them, and more sorry to hear about your daughter.<p>How long did your panic disorder last? How'd you get it into resolved? What therapies did you pursue, how long did they take, and how well did they work?<p>I developed PD after making the idiotic decision to work (at a Wall Street job) through a flu-- not a cold, but actual influenza-- taking only 2 days off. Stupid macho trader bullshit I tried to pull at 24. So I didn't recover properly and ended up developing a respiratory infection that intermittently made breathing difficult: hence, panic attacks. At the same time, two very close friends (a little bit too deep into psychedelics) were having nervous breakdowns at the same time and even though I wasn't using, I started worrying that it might happen to me, because I was dealing with their bullshit every day. Which meant that the panic attacks became self-reinforcing; because I saw mental illness in my daily life, I thought I might develop it. Of course, that didn't happen because, even though it feels otherwise, panic disorder is not ""going crazy"". I think panic disorder is actually more like a much less severe cousin of epilepsy (an acute, intermittent, and highly treatable physical problem) than chronic mental illness, but that's anther rant.<p>I don't have full-on panic attacks at this point, but I still have low-level anxiety attacks (the kind that normal people get once a decade or so, which are rough but NOT panic attacks) on a 1-2 per day frequency.<p>It was a fascinating experience, but a deeply negative one. It doesn't help that most people think of panic attacks as the punchline to a joke. Sometimes I feel the need to say, ""No, you didn't actually have a 'panic attack' when you saw Lady Gaga wear the meat-dress."" This must be what people with real insomnia feel when idiots write Facebook statuses like ""farmville at 2:30 am. i'm such an insomniac lol"".<p>What has actually stayed with me is the incompetence of the U.S. medical system. The experience of being neglected in a time of (perceived) exigent emergency is jarring. More scarring than the attacks themselves (during a panic attack, you don't write many memories, and this is a good thing) was how much medical incompetence and don't-give-a-shit attitude I experienced when I was sick with this ""mystery"" health problem (the respiratory infection and panic disorder onset happened at the same time) that turned out, thankfully, not to be that serious. I'm terrified of what it will be like in a few decades (fingers crossed) when I have to deal with real, serious health problems-- I hope the system is less broken, by then.",1304443525

I know many creative people who have tons of projects and commitments that they can't bring themselves to leave and as a result, they never have enough time to concentrate fully on their next big things.

For example, people who have insufficient levels of serotonin or dopamine and are prone to clinical depression.  That's like someone with  broken legs using a wheelchair.  Or like a diabetic taking insulin.<p>It's hard for people to know quite where they stand.  To the best of my knowledge there's no good way to determine if someone has low levels of dopamine.  Judging people as if they are taking drugs for the sake of enhancement presumes that person isn't in fact trying to compensate for a deficiency.<p>Curious that some people dislike the idea of chemical enhancement but have no problem with mechanical enhancement.<p>If taking drugs is like riding a bike or  driving a car (or even using a wheelchair)  instead of walking, why don't people disparage bike riding, etc.? I mean, you could have travelled that same distance without it, right?<p>No one gets upset because someone rides a bike for the fun of it, but somehow taking drugs for the fun of it is suspect, something you have to (gasp)  <i>admit</i> to.",1304442324

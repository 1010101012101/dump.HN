Evil genius maybe but asking for permission in these type of things leads to stalemate. Google to a huge risk but a calculated one. I think it's defensible more than just business-wise. At the end of the day, publishers have always tried to put sticks in the wheels of anything new in the book world. Google's move is good for man kind in a way and I think it was also helpful to groups like the Internet Archive.",1295564392

In fact, it looks like you've put a lot of effort into making your startup look very professional.<p>I don't have a lot to critique about the actual business, but hopefully I can give you some constructive criticism.<p>On the pricing/signup page I noticed that the background image you're using for the pricing table is gigantic -- 122kb (<a href=""http://static.ma.rs/application_assets/site/images/prices_bg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.ma.rs/application_assets/site/images/prices_bg...</a> 122kb). I'm on a fairly fast connection here (16mbits/down) and it took a noticeable amount of time to load. I'm assuming that it's a 24bit png, but since you're using a white background behind it you won't need the alpha layer and it seems like (based on the colors used in the image) that you could get away with an 8bit png and have it look just fine.<p>Also on the pricing page, ""limited"" and ""full"" don't tell me much about what I'll be getting. Maybe have the ability to mouse over that text and get a little description of what you mean?<p>I'll append any additional thoughts to this comment as I check it out, but so far you have a really great looking startup on your hands.

But I also had a nagging feeling that there was more to my procrastination than just laziness, and that I needed to get more deeply in touch with my own motivations so my work could be harmonious rather than a constant struggle against myself.  Honestly I didn't even really know what I wanted.<p>So instead of resolving to stick to a schedule for pursuing a particular project, I resolved to meditate every day and let the rest sort itself out.  I have meditated sporadically for about 10 years, and always appreciated it, but recently had gotten out of the habit.<p>So far it's been pretty good.

This also increases productivity across the whole company, as there is a lot less communication overhead.

My normally chaotic emotions are subdued and I have a profound feeling of well-being and peace.  This generally lasts for several days to several weeks depending on the lengths of sitting.  Sitting daily sometimes has this effect as well, it is more intermittent for me.<p>On the other hand, I am sometimes consumed by the strongest, most negative emotions I've ever experienced after sitting for extended periods.  Since starting meditation, I've had numerous anxiety attacks and periods of rage.  For the first time in my life, it became really real to me that I was going to die.  A lot of anxiety that I had apparently suppressed over the years came to a head, which was anything but pleasant.  I've had numerous health issues which I largely attribute to stress, so it's not like my life has been stress-free from the meditation.  I've also been pushed towards examining most of my beliefs, particularly of a religious/spiritual nature, and have had to let go of a lot of things that used to give me comfort.<p>To paraphrase the buddhist doctrine, life is suffering, and everything is subject to change.  Meditation has many benefits but I'm not of the opinion that there is a steady state of happiness/bliss that can be achieved.  I think the best that can be done is to deal with difficult situations more gracefully, as they are unceasing, and to show compassion towards our fellow beings, as they are struggling under the same delusions, prejudices, and pains that we are.",1295562567

And why is that front-end is specialist and back-end  is generalist? This point is very weak, and I'd say that the main problem with back-end specialist coming to front-end is the tendency to dismiss it as ""easy"".<p>#3: I have both. And prototype. Good JS developer does not make good front-end engineer. Experience with popular frameworks <i>is</i> a plus. Also, if you know jQuery you will know your CSS selectors—that's a plus.<p>#4: Author has a point there. I'd not say good F-EE must be an artist, but a good taste and design sense is a huge plus:
with those qualities one can see misalignments, broken rhythm, stray font, etc. without the need of designer to point at that.<p>#5: Wrong.

For a while, due to back pain, I switched to lying meditation.  I was not a fan, it was much easier to drift off.  Zen meditation typically involves leaving the eyes partly open to avoid daydreaming or entering some sort of trance state.  I also found this difficult to maintain while in a prone position.<p>Sitting in full lotus is difficult for me, and I'm relatively flexible.  I generally sit half-lotus or in a chair.  Sitting without a chair for long periods causes pain in the legs and back/shoulders.  That's part of the practice, learning to maintain focus and equanimity through pain and discomfort.<p>To the best of my knowledge, the common sitting postures - lotus, half-lotus, burmese, seiza - came about because they were maintainable for long periods.  Sitting indian style with legs crossed in front, for example, your stomach muscles will quickly tire and you'll be hunched over.",1295561397

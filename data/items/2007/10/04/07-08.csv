62936,comment,62822,62822,0,0,Tichy,,,"Can it be true that there is no way to monitor that one important property, the position of my website in the search results for certain keywords? Granted, allowing to check for this in an automated way would probably result in a lot of requests to Google's servers, but on the other hand, people will check for it anyway, so why not let the machines do it?",1191483756

Everyone making interfaces or informational diagrams should understand that value contrast is the most important to human ability to distinguish colors, and should use a color model like Munsell or Lab to pick colors.<p>PS: this text box doesn't let me put (more than 1) literal *s in it; there seems to be no way to escape them so they don't end up emphasizing my text.

In the process, ironically, I have come to respect Venture Capitalist as a profession, which I believe is the least understood if not the most misunderstood. And I am convinced that mistakes I have made with VC's (eventually turning them into my worst enemies) were a result of my inexperience as a CEO compounded by a total lack of understanding of who VC's are and what they do for a living.",1191481417

And, remember this program is really for young children, with the manual dexterity to move the mouse around and click on things, not necessarily the kids who blog, have myspace pages, or join multiplayer online games and such. We will be refining our target audience as we get more user feedback.

We are open to suggestions.",1191481333

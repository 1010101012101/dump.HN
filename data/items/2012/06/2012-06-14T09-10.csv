Having seen the incompetent UX work the Beeb have done on their homepage in recent years  (BBC Sport redesign, anyone?), I can understand why they don't have that much confidence in their own abilities.<p>It's a shame that the BBC's arbitrary fear of confusion, which is fundamentally rooted in their own inability to manage expectations, is preventing millions of people from accessing interesting content.",1339667992

4110567,comment,4110445,4110517,2,0,aac74,,,"They soon will. In the UK there are two versions of the BBC. The main one charges a 'licence fee' if you own a tv and another one called 'channel 4'. Channel 4 is part funded out of general taxation and part funded by ads. They will soon be forced to merge because the internet is bringing the licence fee racket to an end. The BBC is desperately trying to work out a way to tax ISPs !",1339667948

4110564,comment,4110271,4110271,5,0,Spittie,,,"I really like Opera. I've used it for months, but every time i just come back to Firefox.
One big problem (for me) it's their release cycle. I know that many people hate the fast releases of Firefox and Chrome, but this way i get new features sooner than Opera.
Another problem are addons. I'm an heavy Scriptish/Stylish user, and there aren't equivalents for those in Opera. I know that i can enable the userscript folder and copy scripts here, but I'm honestly too lazy to do it, and loading CSS through javascript is just not fast enough.
Then there are the nitpicks. For example, on Firefox/Chrome ""right click > search on google"" open a new tab, on Opera it load Google in the current tab. Or, on Firefox/Chrome middle-clicking on the back button open the previous page in a new tab. On Opera this just doesn't work (at least, until Opera 11.64 - I haven't tried Opera 12 yet).
And Opera is not opensource. While it's not a so big deal for me, i prefer to use opensource applications when i can.<p>There are also features that i would love to see on Firefox. Tab Stacking is awesome, way better than Panorama. I really like also how Opera put the tab bar on the left, I find it better than Tree Style Tab.<p>I'll try the new version later, but i doubt that the new features will be worth a switch for me.",1339667920

He is perfectly correct to post this. Why are people forced to fund private business ? How can this generate an optimal structure of production ? If the demand was there for the product no 'force funding' would be required and thus we would be sure that scarce resources were being put to their best, wealth creating, use. It is immoral to send people to jail for watching unencrypted tv streams. Just as it is wrong to send people a product they didn't want and then bill them when they use it. It is even worse to do this then recycle the cash into a foreign business then use profits from that business to prop up the main racket !",1339667496

This is like complaining that this android app won't work on your 10 year old dumbphone.<p>Yes, it sucks that some screen reading software depends on outdated browsers, but the fault lies at the manufacturers of that software, not every single website designer in the world.

Maybe they didn't want their customers accounts being compromised because they use an insecure browser, and then have to hire more people to take care of that person who lost their account becuase they're using software a decade old.

I've told countless people about how Opera really is the best browser, by far, and how people using Chrome and Firefox are stuck in the stone-age of Internet Explorer 6. I'm getting tired to repeat it.<p>Screw it, I'll do a quick run. Depending on how good your computer is, Chrome will buckle (freeze your computer, in my case) sooner or later after you keep increasing the number of tabs, due to the one process per tab design flaw. That does not usually happen with Opera (unless you have some very demanding pages, which doesn't usually happen to me), it will keep going as long as you have the RAM to supply it. Right now opera:cpu shows me a round number of 115 tabs with 1.5 GB RAM usage, plus the plugin wrapper grabbing an additional 400 megs. Given that this particular computer has 12 GB of RAM I think it's very reasonable.<p>Of course, I don't have a rocket computer at home but the performance is very good as well on a mediocre laptop.<p>Now, what good does it do to have 115 tabs if you can't see them or switch between them at your wish? In Chrome you have one line of tabs that keep pushing against another, and at 115 tabs you could not select your tab properly, nevermind reading the tab title.
In Opera I just configured my tab bar to wrap to multiple lines and aligned it vertically on the left side. I also have tab groups that work very nicely to minimize unnecessary clutter.
I can also turn the tab bar off altogether and move between tabs with ctrl + tab or right mouse button + wheel, or hold ctrl + tab + mouse click.<p>The possibilities for customization are so numerous I can't be bothered to describe them all. Opera is a true browser and it has all these features out of the box without getting in your way.<p>You're a hacker? Where's your curiosity? Explore Opera's features (like mouse gestures, keyboard navigation, and so on) and see for yourself.<p>And by the way, one last thing. The default option for Opera is to restore your tabs from your last browsing session, which was not the case for Chrome and Firefox last time I checked (and if that didn't change it's retarded, although I would understand the reasoning, they don't want to encourage you to keep your tabs open because the browser might buckle under the pressure of 10 open tabs). So really, feel free to keep open as many tabs as you like.<p>You can also use ghostery (an extension) to block all these resource-consuming background scripts, just in case you have reached the limits of your hardware.<p>I have enable 'plugins only on demand', so no Flash player will be loaded without my explicit consent. Again, this is out of the box. Also, content blocker. And so on and so forth.",1339666087

It's not like they are essential to have in a good browser but once you get used to them it's painful to switch.<p>For me it is configurability (if that's a word). Primarily ability to configure controls out of the box. For keyboard, mouse and mouse gestures. This includes dozens of custom actions, even javascript, all of which can be combined using logical conjunctions. No other browser I tried allows you this, not even close.<p>Configuring the UI is pretty straight forward as well, and if there is anything not available through the UI you can always dig into config files.<p>Some other features it's hard to browse without: global and per-site configuration of: blocked content, pop-ups, javascript, cookies, plugins, on demand plugins, images, custom layouts, .... edit: and back button actually works as expected<p>That's just a small subset of dozens of features I miss in other browsers. I don't use any of those extra apps (reader, mail, torrent, irc, ...) but they don't bother me either.<p>And what I miss in Opera? Switching tabs by their position (alt/ctrl+number in many tabbed applications). That's it. What bothers me is that many sites do not work properly or are completely blocked in Opera. The former is due to low market share of Opera, the latter is because people are dicks (hi google). Just write that it's not supported and I won't call your support line, don't make me change my user agent all the time (luckily I can configure this per-site :P).<p>edit: Totally forgot this but other comment pointed it out: Opera can handle a lot of tabs, no other browser I tried could do this: memory, performance and UI wise.",1339664679

I didn't intend to make light of how <i>incredible</i> that particular convenience is over other methods. I don't doubt or discount that the iPad app is <i>leaps and bounds</i> improved over other methods in this particular case. Again, none of that is disputable as far as I see.<p>The particular dimension of the story I felt worth pointing out that was disputable, however, were the ways in which the author made hyperbolic claims. I could tell with the reactions in the HN comments that everyone was capitalizing on the anti-PRC/Apple angle and somewhat beating it to death. Speaking as a parent of two, the eldest of whom started speaking later than ""normal"" and still seems to have some issues (though by no means as extreme as Maya's), it was the claims that there was <i>zero</i> communication without the app that stood out to me (particularly after taking other content on the blog into consideration).<p>It is unquestionably sad and pathetic when anything that truly helps improve people's lives in a demonstrable way is threatened by crap in the business world. Stories like Maya's are excellent for helping enlighten people to the ways that IP fighting can seriously degrade people's lives. I just still think it's worth being intellectually honest even amid the harshest emotional pulls.",1339664432

He did not only gather ideas; he made sure that there were good ones, too. Doing that requires probing deep, and probing deep hurts. I think he also worked on his efficiency by dismissing people who didn't have high ratios of good ideas, and wasn't afraid to ditch a good or even an excellent idea for a better one. That must have hurt those with those good ideas.<p>Can one do that without being coming over as an asshole? Probably, but not efficiently.<p>That does not mean he was an all-out asshole, though. For example, from the little I read, Jobs cared for his family. Because of that, I would call him ruthless, not an asshole.<p>It is a bit like being an world-class athlete. They will do whatever is necessary to improve their sporting ability. You simply cannot become best of the world by thinking ""that is her only chance at the Olympics. Let her go; my chance will come"", or without sacrificing something or someone in you social life. Does that make them assholes? IMO: no.",1339664407

But for BI to work, this essentially _has_ to be the case! Lets say the total amount of money (however you want to count it) is M, while the total amount of goods and services produced in 1 period of time is P. If BI were instated, how could it be paid for? Either increase M (by printing money essentially), or by keeping M constant, but redistribute it from those who have more (the machine owners) to those who don&#x27;t have as much. Increasing M simply causes inflation, since P didn&#x27;t change in this case, and so after a while, shit just gets more and more expensive. Redistributing M is what you said above - forcibly taking the assets from someone and give it to someone else. Neither is going to work imho. You might say P would increase, offsetting the problem of increasing M and the inflation it causes. THat might happen, but i don&#x27;t think the rate at which P increases will match the rate at which M increases.",1372082396

Can someone with more knowledge explain it to me?<p>It seems (to me at least) that some exercise is better than no exercise, and that more exercise (at least to an extent) is better than less exercise. It seems to me therefore, that people should find an exercise that they really enjoy (whether running, cycling, strength training, climbing, martial arts, etc) and do it. That way, they&#x27;ll be doing something they enjoy and they&#x27;ll do more of it.<p>It seems slightly disingenuous for &quot;experts&quot; to recommend that everyone drop everything else and just do one type of exercise as if everyone they&#x27;re speaking to is exactly the same, has exactly the same goals and enjoys exactly the same stuff.<p>Are they targeting geeks/the HN crowd because geeks tend to favour the idea that there is one &quot;right way&quot; of doing something and are more likely to latch on to it?",1372082361

5932852,comment,5931893,5931893,22,0,tokenadult,,,"Some comments ask whether Pierre de Fermat may have had a proof of his conjecture (which I now call the Fermat-Wiles Theorem) using the mathematics of his day. Agreeing with Colin, on historical grounds, I think Fermat did NOT have a proof of his famous conjecture.<p>The historical reasoning works like this. In Fermat&#x27;s day, mathematical &quot;publishing&quot; was not submission of articles to peer-reviewed journals, but people interested in mathematics sending personal letters to one another. (One of the first mathematical journals, if I remember correctly, began as a collection of mathematicians&#x27; letters to one another, something like turning individual emails into an email list.) Fermat was a lawyer by occupation, and did mathematics in his free time. He corresponded with other mathematicians of his era, including Pascal. In all the surviving correspondence Fermat had with other mathematicians, there is no trace of a proof of &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem,&quot; even though, as Colin pointed out, he wrote about simpler cases of that theorem.<p>The real historical reasoning comes in by considering dates of the primary sources. Fermat&#x27;s note to himself in the margin of the printed Latin translation of Diophantus was written EARLY in Fermat&#x27;s investigation of number theory. He read that book, taking notes in the margins as he read, and then he wrote for years afterward about interesting number theory problems. The book with Fermat&#x27;s annotations was published after Fermat&#x27;s death by Fermat&#x27;s son, and that is when the marginal note became known to the world, but Fermat had plenty of time--and plenty of pieces of paper with wider margins--to write out a complete proof of his conjecture if he actually had one. So as essentially all mathematicians have concluded on mathematical grounds, and as all historians have concluded on historical grounds, most likely Fermat briefly thought he had a complete proof of his conjecture, which he then worked on, discovering a mistake in his reasoning. He proved a simpler case of the theorem, died, and then when his notes were published, other mathematicians worked on the full conjecture for 350 years before Wiles found the complete proof, based on advanced research by other mathematicians still alive today.<p>Google Books links to the historical background from mathematicians who write good popular books about mathematics:<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=I-RSVN6TjXsC&pg=PT95"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=I-RSVN6TjXsC&pg=PT95</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhK73qVgOw0C&pg=PA265"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhK73qVgOw0C&pg=PA265</a>",1372082132

Its not a question i m in authority or knowledgable enough to answer, but my take on it is that its a snowball effect - once you gain enough capital (or, as i called it above - means of production), you can effectively get other people&#x27;s productivity as a lever to increase your own. Note, only those who already have capital can do this - people who cannot accrue capital either take big gambles (like borrowing lots of money without being able to pay it back, if they can borrow it at all). Or they just don&#x27;t do it, and remain status quo. Either way, the only option left for them is to live or work. Thus the cycle perpetuates, and this is the &quot;cause&quot; of the wealth divide - not because some people worked harder, but because opportunities don&#x27;t come knocking equally.<p>In aa he world where automation is completely replaced all labour, either everyone is capable of being an owner, and thus, all profit to be made using automation is so thin you don&#x27;t get much of an advantage doing it compared to someone else. Or, some small group basically owns all means of production, and essentially owns the world and everyone in it (either via their power to control resource supply, since they own it!), or indirectly via lobby/&quot;taxes&quot; they pay that the rest of the meeples gets to live off.<p>I m hoping the first scenario comes to pass, but i highly doubt it.

Programmers and businesses do need easy-to-use, cross-platform and cross-device APIs and programming languages. I think we can port a lot of the Web APIs to a language-neutral, binary-neutral, implementation-neutral semantic representation. Dump as much of the unnecessary complexity from Web APIs as possible.<p>Well, this is exactly why I am a huge fan of technologies like MOAI (<a href=""http://getmoai.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getmoai.com/</a>) where the VM is under the control of the implementor, whose efforts to put the working VM on Platform-[X] results in a single codebase that will run on all Platform[s].  In my opinion, it pretty much matches your requirements, from the simple language, easy to use API, and more importantly: control over the host environment.<p>The only issue is that competence in MOAI in developing a cross-platform truly 100% compatible code base means you have to scale your attention from the up-front App, down to the lower-level host code.  Or else.  But thats 100% of the fun, imho ..<p>Note that this is just one of many such solutions to the issues you describe, and it is indeed a fertile playground for anyone with as much affinity for Lua - and similar tools - as one must have, to suffer the platform wars pleasantly, these days ..",1372081742

But you must admit that modern art is a lot less popular and accessible than older. (Side point: a lot of photography I see is very powerful and moving and also accessible. I would argue that photographers are the true heirs of renaissance artists and deserve more respect. But that&#x27;s again a question of taste).<p>>I think this controversy is a very interesting one and I enjoy watching it-- but you have to be aware of the controversy for a lot of it to make sense. I posit that we should teach it because it&#x27;s part of our culture and has been for decades.<p>That seems a bit circular, and worse, backwards. If it were truly part of our culture then people would understand and relate to it whether it was taught or not. If modern art in fact belongs to a small subculture, then it remains to be shown why we should be teaching it as opposed to, say, skateboarding (which is an expressive artform with a rich and complex culture around it - but can seem empty and meaningless to outsiders).<p>>On a more personal note, a lot of modern art is trash in the way that a lot of pre-modern art was too. But a lot of it also speaks to me, and I don&#x27;t appreciate what I interpret as your weirdly simultaneously faux-populist and faux-elitist suggestion that I&#x27;m being insulted.<p>Maybe you don&#x27;t get that feeling, but the GP is not unique in it. A lot of modern art and artists seem to look down on their audience; they&#x27;re obtuse for its own sake, and dismiss critics as too stupid to get it. Whereas from the old masters I get a far more friendly vibe; they can be paternalistic, but there seems to be a desire to work on multiple levels, to offer something to improve even the most inexperienced or childish viewer, while providing more depth to those who want to appreciate it - but you can take as much or as little as you want.<p>>2. I dispute your implicit claim that high art ever had that tremendous an audience. In raw terms, it&#x27;s actually larger today than it was a hundred years ago-- think about the number of people we educate today versus then.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you talk of &quot;high art&quot; because my understanding is the divide didn&#x27;t really exist prior to about 1900. Composers once saw popularity as the measure of success, and would make efforts (e.g. piano arrangements) to make their work accessible to those who could not hear the &quot;full&quot; version. Likewise plays and even operas were popular forms, again aiming for the largest audience possible. Your point about raw numbers is true but I don&#x27;t think particularly relevant.<p>>Which philosophers are you accusing of navel gazing? Perhaps we&#x27;ll agree, perhaps not.<p>Satre is probably the greatest example, seemingly wilfully incomprehensible. The whole direction of recent philosophy - cultural relativism and postmodernism - seems not merely pointless but actively harmful, denying the obvious value of scientific truth and western civilization, and for what benefit?<p>>And who do you consider high-music? Again, perhaps we&#x27;ll agree, perhaps not.<p>So restrict our attention to music using the classical orchestra. There are people composing popular works that I would expect to still be played many years from now - those making film and videogame soundtracks. But the establishment seems to look down on those, and indeed on anything that uses traditional harmony, tonality etc.<p>I think the common theme coming through here is that while older art could be difficult it never seemed wilfully so; the artist was always cooperating with the viewer, trying to raise them up. Modern art seems to see the viewer as competition, someone who must be tested to see if they&#x27;re worthy.

5932585,comment,5930977,5932377,2,0,a-priori,,,"For those not interesting in watching a documentary about the incident, the summary is that McDonalds served a woman, Stella Liebeck, coffee which was approximately 85C. Most coffee shops, at least at the time, served coffee about 60C. After getting the drink from the drive-through, she spilled the entire coffee on herself while adding sugar and cream to it. She was the passenger in the car, and the incident happened with the car parked. She received third-degree burns and needed a skin graft. She eventually won a substantial sum from McDonalds in a civil lawsuit.<p>The coffee&#x27;s temperature met McDonald&#x27;s policy. They set it higher than their competitors because they assumed people would keep it in a cup holder and want it to be a more drinkable temperature when they arrived at their destination. Today, McDonald&#x27;s has not changed their policy and still serves coffee at 80-90C, and places like Starbucks serve it at similar or higher temperatures. They are able to do this because of better packaging that&#x27;s less likely to spill the entire drink even if it&#x27;s dropped on your lap like Liebeck did.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald&#x27;s_Restaurants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald&#x27;s_Restauran...</a><p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think that it was a frivolous lawsuit. She did receive serious burns, more serious than I would expect someone to receive from spilled coffee.",1372078930

I designed it to be more simple and accessible than the competition. It&#x27;s for people like myself who find Illustrator too intimidating and/or excessive.<p>There are plenty of things in the pipeline like a text tool and a grid/guides system, but I&#x27;d love your feedback on the UI/stability as well as ideas for features or integrations with other products. Let me know what you think!",1372078910

Not talked about for obvious political reasons now a days because that would bring up obvious difficult questions...  All the issues mentioned were trees in the forest being fought over as PR fodder for the bigger issue of the south wanted to be the south and didn&#x27;t want some yankee telling them anything, even if the yankee was correct.  Extreme stubbornness on both sides.  Then the war of northern aggression started because the southerners told the northerners to F off and leave them alone too many times.<p>If you could have magically removed slavery and plantations from the history of the south and reinsert another set of trees like space alien contact and medieval era 3-d printers, the forest would remain and the civil war would have been fought more or less the same way over PLA vs ABS figurines of intellectually protected property of images of space aliens or something.<p>The Trees Just Don&#x27;t Matter (compared to the forest)<p>To some extent I believe this comes from the HN population consisting of many unmarried people.  Trust me, once you get married you can bicker over stuff that has nothing to do with the real issue all day if you want.",1372078818

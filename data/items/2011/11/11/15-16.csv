The only reason why it's evil is because they think the employees are actually valuable enough that they want to keep them around but not valuable enough to keep good on their stock units. They could easily fire the employees and let them re-interview for their old jobs if they wanted and it would be perfectly legal (companies do this on a regular basis to rehire employees as contractors without benefits).<p>RSUs and stock options like this are pretty interesting to me because it provides a huge incentive for employees to stay at the company, but it also provides a huge incentive for employers to fire their employees after (N-1) time periods where N is when their units vest.",1321026907

Minimum wage in China is set per province, and different coastal provinces at different times have been posting significant minimum wage hikes, even competing with each other's wage hikes, for quite a while now.<p>But more importantly, the government policy actions haven't been the most important factor at work; many employers have been raising wages ahead of and above the minimum wage hikes, and have been actively sending out recruiters for the first time. Many of them have started having a hard time finding enough workers for the first time, after spending the past couple decades seeing long lines form for any job posting. The Chinese labor market has been tilting toward workers' favor on its own, with workers having a lot more options. This will keep pressuring wages up in the coastal provinces, keep redistributing production and domestic spending power to the inland provinces and other countries in southeast and south Asia, and keep spreading domestic demand throughout, all of which is overall good for all of them, and good for the rest of us.",1321026864

Revenue of course matters, but the way you get that revenue is to get people to go through the conversion funnel. What this A/B test shows, though crudely, is one optimization of one portion of the funnel.  When you get more people to click on, say, a product page, you're ""widening the funnel"" at that particular point.<p>It's entirely possible to widen the funnel higher up, and still have the same amount of revenue; however, this doesn't mean that it was a useless optimization. Whenever you widen the funnel, you get the potential for higher revenue, especially with further optimizations. That makes for an increase in performance.<p>Lastly, widening the funnel at any point also means that you are getting increased page views, increased product views, and increased stickiness.  That is _always_ a good thing, regardless of whether you increase your revenue or not. It means that people are more likely to interact, and buy from, your site in the future-- users are naturally more likely to go to a site that they know. So, greater click throughs to a product page, though you may not immediately see an effect, will almost always lead to greater revenue.",1321026620

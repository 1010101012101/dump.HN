127826,comment,127711,127711,0,0,niels_olson,,,"I just spent four weeks on a pediatric neurology clerkship in medical school, and my wife is a pediatric occupational therapist. Throw away your TV.<p>Just do it.<p>After Katrina, when we evacuated to my parents' house, they'd just moved in themselves, the day before. We agreed to not hook up cable. My kids calmed down noticeably. No, remarkably. We watch, maybe, a movie or two a week. The DVD player broke, so they only watch those movies on a computer anyway. The TV hasn't been turned on in weeks. I now own a $5000 Ethan Allen box to hide a $500 TV box that I don't use. Just throw the boob tube away. What do you do with a livingroom that has no TV? Feng shui.<p>My wife has started advising parents of kids with ADHD to get rid of their TVs. They're scared at first, but they do it. And in a few days or weeks they love her for it.<p>The pediatric neurologists I was with last month think ADHD probably isn't even a legit diagnosis (psychiatric diagnoses are voted on). They very frankly told me they think it's mainly a combination of TV and bad parenting, which is on the rise thanks to TV and entirely too many double-income homes. And if you're questioning their politics, these folks are <i>insanely</i> smart and educated, and probably more liberal than Noam Chomsky, and I know at least one that raised four kids herself.<p>In case you missed it: throw away the TV. All of them.<p>For specific readings, go to PubMed's Entrez site and look up the author ""Christakis DA"". He's prolific, but his biggest newsmakers are some rather large studies showing dose-dependent correlations between TV and obesity, attention deficit, violence at school, and I think there was something else.",1204520033

127812,comment,127802,127802,0,0,iamdave,,,"Honestly, I find the subject matter of the ad more relevant than the presence of an ad.  Partner up with good sites like New Egg or Tiger Direct for ads and you're bound to get some good numbers.  Stick with Google AdSense (and that's not to say anything negative about AdSense) and you wont see near the same numbers mostly because<p>1. Everyone recognizes AdSense and it doesn't really stand apart from content (this reflects on how effectively and tactfully place your ad)<p>2. More common is it becoming to see Ads on AdSense that point to TLD's that display no relevant information, or useful data, so people automously ignore them.<p>Advertisements are all about the audience, much less the product.  Get the right ads, and you'll see results even with the techie crowd who are more familiar with blatantly bad advertisements.",1204519189

Redhat's market capitalisation is 3.47 billion dollars. MySQL's market capitalisation is 1 billion dollars. Other open source companies form a long tail and make the size of the open source market quite arguable. Regardless, I would be surprised if Microsoft obtain 2% of revenue from open source in 2008. I'll be more surprised if revenue from open source fully offsets losses from comparable but open source operating systems, databases and productivity applications.",1204519167

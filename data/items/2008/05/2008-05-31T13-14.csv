The one I've found that doesn't is Trazadone, and it seems to keep working indefinitely. The pills (e.g. Mirapex) for RLS do work, but make me nauseated every night.",1212242275

A 10 hour half life means at 30 hours, you'd still have 12.5% of the caffeine in your system and at 40 hours you'd have 6.25%. I'd have coffee in me from the last week still in effect. Is there some other half life term I'm not familiar with?<p>In this regard, I'd go with wikipedia. There are plenty of doctors who are wrong in the world--they are only human.",1212242172

I'd certainly believe what an MD with 12-15 years of education/residency says over wikipedia.<p>People can build up a tolerance to caffeine by saturating the receptors in the brain that are activated by caffeine.  So, after month of daily ingestion, some people can drink 4-8 cups of coffee a day and not have any problems.  In this case, it's especially true that your mileage may vary greatly.<p>I used to be a caffeine fiend.  But, when I started having sleep problems, I had to completely quit caffeine, and it does help.  I could drink 2-3 triple espresso's in an all-nighter and then sleep like a baby when I was in college.  Now, I drink 1/2 a cup of coffee and I'm buzzed for hours, and I don't sleep well that night.",1212239002

56176,comment,56010,56010,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Demo something.  Don't make excuses about why you don't have a demo...demo something, and tell them what you'll change to make it great.  The demo is just so they know you can actually build something.  Recently there have been quite a few YC companies that have already built something impressive at the time of the interview, so your competition is stiff.  But folks with crappy or no demos also make it in, sometimes.<p>I just think your odds are much better if you demo something.  Realize that some of the guys you're up against can produce a working web application that does something useful in a few hours.  So, mock something up.<p>Make a demo.  How else can I say it?  Demo something!",1190100951

That said, there are plenty of angel investors, VC's, etc.<p>From a linkedin Q&A on Indian VC scene [<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/answers/finance-accounting/financing/venture-capital-private-equity/FIN_CFN_VNC/58777-26329"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/answers/finance-accounting/financing...</a>]
1. US firms in India (Sequoia, Greylock, Matrix, Mayfield, Sherpalo/KP etc.)
2. Domestic funds (Helion, Nexus and a few others)
3. Angel groups / funds (Seed fund, Mentor, Band of Angels) <p>Good luck!

I'd still apply; you can hack your way to a visa later.<p>There's a lot of room for YC clones in India and the rest of the world, but there is no South or East Asian YC yet.",1190100341

I've been known to design. I project manage from time to time. I have a computer science degree. I make $80k a year and could make more but prefer the lifestyle.<p>When people ask me what I do, I say, ""the internet."" When IT people ask me what I do, I say ""web application developer."" When people that work on the web ask me, I say ""social media.""<p>What should I call myself? <p>I hate when people ask if I'm a ""web designer."" Not to hate on designers, they're priceless, it's just not what I do. Technically I run my own business, but I'm more consultant than entrepreneur. I want a title that speaks to the masses, with the same clarity as ""computer programmer"" but reflective of my decidedly web and social media orientation. <p>Help?",1190099239

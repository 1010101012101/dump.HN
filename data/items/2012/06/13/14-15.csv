Maybe we are all fucking idiots, somehow, some way, but I tend to think if you've got a computer in front of you, whatever you're doing, you're in a mighty fine privilege.  All computers have incurred their debt upon the planet; to dispose of a computing device because it is 'slow' is an ultimate failure to comprehend the nature of computing: the user makes a decision to use, or not use, arbitrarily.<p>I have a couple Toughbooks from the 90's, I'll probably never throw them away, but instead keep using them for more years yet, because: fully user upgradable.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=panasonic+toughbook+cf25&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=panasonic+toughbook+cf25&...</a><p>Though slow by 'modern standards', they are still perfectly usable computers, still quite adequate for most needs, which haven't really changed terribly much.  Slow-ass Pentium 133's with a nice, tight, Linux distribution, no driver worries whatsoever, and workable for my needs.  One is an offline Wikipedia/Doc-dump that can be easily road-tripped, powered from a cross-bike battery, chucked up the cliff and so on, and the other is a general-purpose debug device for various embedded projects back in the lab, where-in such things as standard serial and parallel ports are still .. a bit useful ..<p>You know why these computers are still in use?  They kick ass.<p>3 Open PCMCIA slots per device.  Magnesium-Alloy cases that take a real beating, and can yet still be opened with a coin, in case you want to put a different component into the gel-protected insides.  In the lab-bench toughbook there is room for its disk as well as various shields, arduinos, proto pcb's, and so on.  It functions very nicely as a carry case in that regard, too: I have room for my DS-one scope, when I need it.<p>Oh, its got standard strap mounts as in I can take one off a gun and strap the toughbook behind me as I ride off into the desert.<p>If Apple ever make something like this, i.e. the complete other end of the spectrum, I would be very surprised.

Apple is so big now that if it decides to build a walled-garden, then such shall the field grow.  If they <i>WANTED</i> to make a computer that could seriously benefit future generations, it wouldn't be out-dated in a decade, or two decades, or even three.

Of these, about 30-40% are laptops.  In my experience, Mac laptop batteries have a high rate of failure, higher than our significantly more dated PC hardware.  With the most recent revs, replacing the battery has become a huge problem, since relatively new hardware (1-2 years old) is now completely shot, unless we buy a proprietary screwdriver (not a big deal, but every time they change the screw, we have to find a shop that sells it), or send it to a Mac repair shop. Now, if we upgrade to the Retina Macbook Pro, we will not have the considerably cheaper and faster option of replacing it ourselves.  Unfortunately, our userbase is such that they ""require"" Mac hardware, so it puts IT in a rough position (having to explain why we're essentially outsourcing our work, and spending money to do so).<p>Now, this isn't necessarily a typical case, but if you were a regular consumer and your battery died, it isn't that hard to buy a replacement battery for the majority of laptops, though this kind of thing is becoming more prevalent.

He had a single, very specific genius, namely gathering lots and lots of ideas and picking the very best one.  (IMO the fact that he was an asshole is probably related but not essential.)  His entire career was applying this single ability, which he really was a genius of, to multiple domains.  He wasn't a genius at anything about those domains per se, just at what he did once he was working in them.  I mean, the fact that he had any technical knowledge at all about operating systems or computer graphics already put him in the top tier of ""business guys"" but that's not the same thing as a deep understanding.<p>For that matter, let's keep going on your list.  Richard Feynmann was a smart guy but all his important work (except superfluidity in helium, I guess) was made exploring a single theme, namely how to put quantum mechanics in a Lagrangian formulation rather than a Hamiltonian.  He told the story once of the event that sparked his first interest in physics as a career, and it was his high school physics teacher taking him aside and explaining the principle of least action (the basis of the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics) - he basically organized the rest of his career around understanding this principle very, very deeply.  The reason he's famous in addition to being smart is that he found a new domain to apply it to, namely quantum mechanics.<p>My point is that while mastering a domain of application was important for these people, probably even crucial, it wasn't really the engine of their success. They first developed a single talent or interest, and then looked for a domain to apply it to.",1339598092

(Sadly, many of the legacies and artifacts of that position still persist).<p>The answer to any of these half-baked arguments should always begin with something along the lines of ""Because we're better than that."" Because we have a constitution that assumes we're good people, and that protects our civil liberties from invasion. Because these things are so fundamental to our nation's purpose that giving them up is much worse than being attacked. Giving them up threatens the very purpose of the country's founding.<p>Even to entertain these arguments, i.e., by trying to cite examples of areas of privacy or liberty that are negotiable, areas that aren't, and so forth, is to stoop low. It is to lose before the argument has actually begun. It is to accept the faulty premise that privacy is about hiding something -- that it is an active attempt to conceal information from the world. No, privacy isn't the action being taken. <i>Invasion</i> of privacy is the action. Privacy is simply a state of being, and one to which we have an inalienable right.<p>Privacy isn't something we opt into; it is something we don't even really consider until we are made, or compelled, or asked to opt out. ""Nothing to hide"" begs the question. It assumes, as a foregone premise, that privacy is an opt-in decision that we consciously undertake in defense of something (and that something is implied to be onerous or illegal). This is just fallacious logic, plain and simple.<p>It's unfortunate that a right to privacy wasn't inumerated directly in the constitution, but was instead defined indirectly.

I might have a car note for a few years.<p>To me that makes all of the difference.<p>I think people should educate themselves on the product and if it doesn't fit within their use case then they should find a product that does.

4106019,comment,4105302,4105302,33,0,rweba,,,"I am also a computer science assistant professor like Cal Newport so I can relate to what he is trying to say here.<p>An academic paper in computer science usually consists of applying a well defined ""technique"" to a well defined ""problem."" For example \napplying ""Support Vector Machines"" to ""Text Classification"" or applying ""Expert Systems"" to ""Medical Diagnosis"" or \napplying ""Particle Filters"" to ""Robot localization""<p>The crux of what Newport is referring to is that in practice, many(most?) academic researchers don't deeply learn new techniques that are outside of their immediate research agenda after leaving grad school. They will certainly be AWARE of new techniques and might learn their high level ideas but they won't really learn them deeply enough to be able to improve them or use them in a non-trivial way. It is much much easier to continue exploiting and building upon the techniques they have already mastered than to invest several painful months(years?) to master completely new techniques.<p>So what Newport is suggesting that you should stop applying your current methods that are easy and very productive for you and make a substantial investment of time and energy to master the latest techniques - <i>even if you don't exactly know how you're going to apply them</i><p>A programming analogy: If you're a C++ programmer, stop doing C++ projects and spend at least 3 months until you're an expert in Python. If you're a Python programmer, stop writing Python and invest several months in becoming an expert in Go. (the analogy is not perfect because mastering a new language is probably a bit easier and more fun than the kind of things Newport is talking about)<p>Here are a couple of thoughts I had on this:<p>(1) How applicable is this idea outside of academic research? For example, in academia there is a big reward for being the FIRST person to apply a given technique to a certain problem, but outside of research being the 2nd or 3rd person to do something can be just fine. (See: Friendster, MySpace, Facebook). So maybe you can afford to wait until someone has shown a great application of a new technique and only then jump in and try to exploit it.<p>(2) An opposing but also convincing idea is that it is better to focus your efforts in one area to avoid spreading yourself too thin. Such focus allows you to gain ""comparative advantage"" and to easily do things that are difficult for people who don't have your deep experience. In other words, it is better to spend your efforts trying to become the world's greatest Python hacker than to jump on the bandwagon of every new programming language that comes out and ending up as a ""Jack of all trades, master of none.""<p>My conclusion: I do think it is worthwhile to challenge yourself not to just stick to what you already know (which in my personal experience is VERY easy to do especially if you find that you're very productive using what you know). But you also have to be selective. Life is too short to try to be a master of everything. And there is great value in gaining a very deep expertise in a particular topic or technique.",1339597010

It would be everybody.  Including all the cops and judges.  Which is never going to happen.<p>The real danger here is selective enforcement of laws, and the selective enforcement of laws.  Well, we have the later already (see ""Professional Courtesy"") but the former gets much more dangerous to the extent that police officers can control which videos do or do not end up at a courtroom. If a lawyer can show that the police are regularly ignoring an offense in other contexts that can be a defense in the US, but in practice the US justice system does a very bad job of getting exculpatory police collected video evidence into the hands of defense lawyers.",1339596560

But modern games are full of Quick Time Events (QTE)s which are spiritually the exact same thing.<p>(I still have the announcer&#x27;s voice calling out &quot;DRAGON&#x27;S LAIR!&quot; in the attract mode seared in my memory).<p>> We were staying in a hotel or motel, and it was either attached to or had a small arcade of its own.<p>For people who didn&#x27;t grow up during the 80s arcade boom. Arcades where <i>everywhere</i>. It was basically expected that every place that sold anything would have at least 1 arcade game. Grocery store? Check. Tanning Salon? Sure thing. Strip mall? Why, they&#x27;ll have 2 complete deluxe arcades.<p>It was a looooong time from the death of Arcades to modern smart phones before we had something to do while hanging around most stores again.<p>The gathering crowd around an awesome play of a game really did happen back then. It&#x27;s like the scene from Tron where Flynn is playing in his arcade. It was <i>actually</i> like that.<p>My older brother could play epic multi-hour long games of some kind of game I can&#x27;t remember the name to (I think it was Pengo), racking up so many extra men that he could go for a bathroom break mid-game and let some scruffy novice kid (usually me) break in and play at the advanced levels for a couple minutes. The convenience store he played in would be packed with 20 or 30 people watching history happen. It gave every small town a local hero they could cheer for and every local hero felt like a minor god for the length of their quarter.",1400723973

Was how the culture in different arcades was always a bit different. The play-styles, how the impromptu tournaments worked, what was considered cheap or fair play...it always interested me as your home arcade group think eventually set a kind of style momentum and mixing it up or discovering new techniques was always kind of a challenge.

Harriman (Director of Union Pacific, Southern Pacific, and Wells Fargo). GWB&#x27;s grandfather, Prescott, made his fortune as VP and Partner at Brown Brothers Harriman, a bank that eventually would employ Prescott&#x27;s son George HW Bush, as well as Alan Greenspan and several other senators and cabinet members. BBH spun out a division that was ultimately Drexel Burnham Lambert -- the 5th largest I-Bank in the country until Michael Milken blew it up. HW Bush&#x27;s maternal grandfather started an investment bank that was eventually sold to Merrill Lynch, and was also a director at Harriman brothers. HW&#x27;s maternal grandfather was president of McCall&#x27;s (publisher of Popular Mechanics, Redbook, and McCalls before selling them to Hearst).<p>George HW Bush&#x27;s business career started at an oil equipment company, Dresser Industries a subsidiary of BBH, where his father had been Director for 20 years. Dresser formed a spin-out JV with Ingersol-Rand and still operates as Dresser-Rand (Mkt Cap: $4.5B).  Dresser Industries would go on to be purchased by Halliburton via a Dick Cheney-negotiated deal for ~$8 billion.  Some years later, HW Bush would co-found Zapata Petroleum Corporation (with a recently retired CIA agent) and Zapata Offshore (funded largely by Phillip Graham, the owner of WaPo), which he would lead until 1966. Zapata Petroleum became Pennzoil (worth an estimated $4.2B in 1998). Zapata Offshore would eventually rebrand as Harbinger Group (Mkt Cap: $2.4B).<p>Zapata has a great history if anyone&#x27;s in the mood for some conspiracy theories: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbinger_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbinger_Group</a>.<p>Tl;dr:<p>* Most of their SEC and disclosure records from the 1960&#x27;s were accidentally destroyed just after HW Bush was appointed to be VP.<p>* Zapata owned off-shore rigs that served as bases of operations for anti-Castro missions<p>* The CIA&#x27;s official codenames for the three boats used in the Bay of Pigs invasion were was <i>actually</i> &#x27;Barbara&#x27;, &#x27;Houston&#x27;, and &#x27;Zapata&#x27;.<p>* Within 24 Hours of JFK&#x27;s assassination, before he had ever ran for office, HW Bush is mentioned by name in a memo prepared by J. Edgar Hoover.<p>* Bill Liedtke, co-founder of Zapata Petroleum, and then-current Chairman of Pennzoil, personally flew nearly $1M of money laundered through a Mexican bank, to DC to beat the impending campaign finance disclosure midnight deadline on behalf of Richard Nixon. $89,000 of that money ended up in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars.<p>George W. Bush, much like Donald Sterling, owned a Major Sports Franchise, though granted it was with an ownership group that only netted him tens of millions when it was sold. I&#x27;ll ignore all the earlier failures GWB saw when he was backed by US and Saudi billionaires (William Draper, Lewis Leherman, Salem bin Laden, Khalid bin Mahfouz).<p>So I guess being scions to a family that&#x27;s spawned multiple billion dollar businesses with activities in banking, venture capital, machinery, railroads, oil and gas, and airlines and being family friends with billionaies had nothing to do with their political power?",1400723603

7781720,comment,7781117,7781117,2,0,kevingadd,,,"This comment thread is filled to the brim with arguments that either demonstrate a lack of familiarity with video games (excusable, but...) or regular old weak thinking.<p>A few variations on this core theme:<p>&quot;The cream will rise to the top&quot;<p>&quot;Good games will find an audience&quot;<p>&quot;Create something truly special and you will be successful&quot;<p>These lines of thinking are all COMPLETE AND UTTER NONSENSE. I would love to live in a world where those statements were true, but they are not. They have <i>never</i> been true in video games, even if they are perhaps true in other industries. Anyone with any experience observing games development, sales and marketing knows that these statements are false.<p>The vast majority of successful game titles are successful as a result of a finely-tuned marketing and sales pipeline.<p>The big studios have their own pipeline for this:\nPaying staff to contact the news outlets and YouTubers, paying to run television advertisements or put up billboards, doing co-promotional deals (like bundling the Battlefield 4 beta in with another game, etc), advertising their new games via popups in older games, buying installs to climb the app store rankings, etc.<p>Smaller developers can&#x27;t use the big studios&#x27; bag of tricks, so they use their own:\nForming industry connections, so that developers and other people with big audiences promote the game to their audiences. Building name recognition and dedicated fanbases by shipping lots of games (Jeff Vogel is a textbook example of this - decades of releases!). Building dozens of cheap games and releasing them to try and find something that fans like. Cashing in on the latest trends and buzzwords in order to get good returns. Slaving away for no pay for months or years, killing yourself to make a &#x27;masterpiece&#x27;.<p>Note that many of the above tricks are <i>not</i> guaranteed to work. Some of the highest-profile &#x27;indie successes&#x27; in the past few years have actually had poor sales or poor revenues, when you examine their budget. In some cases this is due to actively being undermined by the storefront. Microsoft has a track record of undermining big releases on XBLA by scheduling them at poor times, dropping them from the front page, and otherwise leaving them to die. Some of the other big publishers do this too - Electronic Arts sank a ton of money into Starbreeze&#x27;s new Syndicate reboot, then spent nearly nothing marketing it and it languished in a pit along with all the other FPSes - even though it&#x27;s actually a quite solid game from a studio with a great pedigree (reviewers agree).<p>Here&#x27;s the reality of building and selling video games:<p>Building video games is expensive. It probably costs more time & money than you realistically have.<p>Selling video games is difficult... and expensive. You often have to sink as much time/money into selling your game as you do in building it - lots of contract reviews/negotiation, along with lawyers&#x27; fees, time spent prepping builds for each storefront and building storefront/platform-exclusive content (steam workshop, achievements, etc).<p>Making it possible for players to find your video game is difficult... and expensive. You sink tons of time/money (often over the whole duration of development) reaching out to journalists, youtubers, genre fans, previous customers, and random strangers. You spend money on booths at conventions like PAX, buy banner ads on game-focused websites, build a mailing list, etc.<p>Even after all this, factors entirely outside your control <i>will</i> fuck you. Your game will get pirated, Steam&#x27;s checkout flow will break during your launch week, a crippling bug found on launch day will undermine your sales, or market forces will simply shift and leave your game stranded in a market players aren&#x27;t interested in anymore. Sometimes another developer literally swoops in under you, clones your game outright (based on all that marketing and outreach you&#x27;ve been doing), and steals a huge chunk of your market. This has happened to Vlambeer <i>multiple times</i> and has happened to other big-name indies (Spry Fox, for example).<p>People interested in dropping some lazy truisms like &#x27;just work hard and build something awesome&#x27; are doing themselves a disservice and lowering the level of discourse. There are hard problems here, and many of them are not actively being solved. Some of the problems are <i>within</i> the industry, and mean developers need to make better choices. Some of them are the industry&#x27;s machinery, with storefronts providing inadequate discovery and unreliable sales pipelines. Some of them are playerbase issues, where players tend to chase after novelty and hot trends (I want a minecraft clone! I want a zombie game!) and don&#x27;t have discerning tastes.<p>Many of these problems aren&#x27;t any one person&#x27;s fault, they&#x27;re just problems we have to fix. But nobody is going to fix anything if we keep plugging our ears and yelling &quot;EVERYTHING IS FINE!&quot;",1400723307

Whatever Zenimax gets out of this lawsuit will be overshadowed by the goodwill they&#x27;ve lost.<p>EDIT: Who would want to work someplace that will aggressively assert rights over your personal projects?<p>Let&#x27;s assume Carmack happened to work on VR within a Zenimax office.  We&#x27;re talking about someone who created Armadillo Aerospace.  If Carmack felt like developing VR outside of Zenimax offices, he obviously could have.  So it must be true that Zenimax didn&#x27;t actually help VR in any substantial way. Carmack&#x27;s VR development just happened to take place within a Zenimax building.  And now they&#x27;re going after him for it, while playing it off like VR wouldn&#x27;t have existed without Zenimax&#x27;s contributions.<p>EDIT2: What convinced me was a thought experiment: imagine Zenimax without Carmack. Now think of all the ways that our imaginary entity could possibly contribute to the development of VR.  At best, our entity provided a building for Carmack to pursue his personal interests in (a &quot;mad scientist lab,&quot; as the Complaint calls it).  Maybe some marketing, but who would deny that the hype would have rolled in regardless of whatever Zenimax did to help it along?  Two seconds looking through a Rift is enough to transform anyone into an evangelist.  The VR ball began rolling due to the efforts of Carmack, not Zenimax.<p>So, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re Zenimax.

Attract top talent by virtue of the buzz, and a creative&#x27;s natural desire to be a part of cool projects.  Your new top talent goes on to create many millions of dollars of value for your company.<p>- Try to assert control over whatever Carmack makes.  Make it abundantly clear that no personal projects will be tolerated by any employee on Zenimax&#x27;s payroll.

(Assuming they actually reach them, which hasn&#x27;t actually gotten any better... that&#x27;s gotten worse.)",1400721866

The way storefronts like iOS and Steam work is there&#x27;s really weak categorization and &#x27;top seller&#x27; lists and maybe tagging and... that&#x27;s it. There are no mechanisms in place to find the &#x27;best games&#x27; and make them rise to the top; no heavy user rating rankings, no time played rankings, no rankings based on which games your friends play, etc.<p>This is part of why he points out the huge increase in Steam launches. Back when Steam was curated, the front page changed infrequently and you could count on at least half the games up there being worth a glance (even if they weren&#x27;t worth buying). Now there&#x27;s basically no filter and half the games that go up are early access or perpetual betas or games from 2001.<p>The best games aren&#x27;t rising to the top. The games that rise to the top are rising to the top. Sometimes the best games are ALSO coincidentally the ones that rise to the top, but not always.<p>If you want a tired example, look at Flappy Bird. It wasn&#x27;t a terrible game, but it wasn&#x27;t an amazing one either. It was just an adequate game, and it managed to get high enough in the charts that it stayed there, because the visibility ensured its success.

They weren&#x27;t all auteur works (although a lot of them were), but they generally felt like they weren&#x27;t just made &quot;to make a game&quot;, they were made because they had a reason to exist. There were definitely a lot of rough edges, but they were interesting. There wasn&#x27;t the hegemony you&#x27;d see in AAA titles.<p>But... you don&#x27;t see that so much in the indie scene now. Many of those games feel like they just exist because someone thought &quot;I should make a game&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that, but it&#x27;s somewhat counter to the spirit that made the scene interesting in the first place.<p>I feel like a lot of indie games now capture the form but not the function. They look indie, but they don&#x27;t really feel indie. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an indie &quot;bubble&quot;, I feel like the scene that had those values has moved somewhere else.

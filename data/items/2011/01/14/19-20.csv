I have never worked for Outsourcing shops, however most of my friends work there.\nI have worked for Product based companies, and I can contrast the two.\nComment on Point 1: Quality: Software applications created by CS students generally are never meant to run for years and have new features added to them. So CS students never focus much on Scalable design, modularity and engineering discipline in general. The discipline in Design, Implementation, Source control and execution was taught to me when I was an intern. Every aspect was reviewed by peers until it met the standards. However, I observed that outsourced project based companies are more focused on delivery/schedule than on quality. I feel that the quality control must be done from outsourcer's end and that too when the code is being developed. This might help them avoid unpleasant surprises.<p>Point 2: Passion: There is a huge imbalance between number of graduates we produce and number of jobs available in India. This works in favor of students who take up CS studies not because they like it but because they thing they will be employable.<p>Point 3: People look down at design??

When and if I do click on the ""start"" link (or the first item in the ToC), I'm greeted with what is very clearly the first part of a walkthrough.  Going through the sections, it's all pretty clearly marked, chunked up into easily digestible pieces, etc.  Perfect for a first glance through the topic, even though I'll definitely admit that in general W3Schools content leaves something to be desired.<p>Conversely, from 2), the Mozilla.org page, it's pretty difficult to figure out where I want to be clicking, assuming I know nothing.  After I discard the ""tools"" section as probably irrelevant to learning from scratch about this, I'm left with the ""Documentation"" column.  So far, so good.<p>The first item in that list says ""Introduction to using XPath in JavaScript"", which still sounds pretty good, except wait!  At the top of the page, it says that XPath is primarily used with XSLT, but this tutorial gives an intro to XPath <i>without</i> XSLT, so that can't be right...why would the special case that <i>doesn't</i> match what people usually use this for be the first item in the documentation list?<p>And yikes, those other links don't really look like introductions to XPath, either, they look like special topics about XPath.

I've been very interested in things that combine hardware with smart phones, since the Apple keynote that showed the first authorized hardware ""extensions"". (though since then, I've been disappointed in not seeing much of anything)<p>However, can anyone chime in about the differences there are between using the iPhone jack and using the dock connector? I know you're supposed to fill out some docs with Apple to officially hack on the dock connector, but I believe you can find hardware to do that without Apple's consent. It looks like one would have to go the jailbreak route with that project as well.<p>I imagine the main thing is that a hobbyist can much more easily/cheaply get a jack connector than a dock connector...",1295032223

The real issue is more simple, how to rank for things using content that lot's of other people are using.  This is a problem especially for people using data feeds (affiliates for example) which could be used by a ton of other people.<p>Have you done your keyword reasearch?  Are you trying to target certain keywords?  Or are you just going for general search engine traffic?  If you have done your keyword research then you should probably be able to answer your own question.  After looking at the search volume available and competition for your keywords, then you pretty much have a blueprint as to what you need to do.<p>For example, if you are trying to rank for the general term of Blahblahwhateverwhocares, California then you are going to have an easier time doing so than ranking for the general term of San Francisco, California.<p>So, there are a lot more factors you have to deal with before you get to duplicate content.",1295032143

That's a totally different problem than not being able to finish a round. (Not to mention what an unlikely and unsophisticated scenario it is to have the problem that 50K was committed at 10M. I feel sorry for both the investor and the founder. Not sure which is more naive...)<p>People on the board can definitely make all the difference, and I generally agree with the pricing numbers given the current market.<p>I just find questioning the founder's judgement on raising at a 3M vs a 5M pre, uhm, questionable.<p>If you are an investor and you know this guy who might one day be negotiating part of an exit for you isn't going to leverage the market to get a good price now, I question your judgement.",1295032100

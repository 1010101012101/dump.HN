The ATmega328P which the Arduino Uno board uses has 32KB of code space and 2KB of SRAM which isn't really enough for something like Java.  The normal way Arduino projects are built is by defining a ""setup"" function and a ""loop"" function which, when compiled, are actually just called by a hidden C++ file with a main function that essentially does this:<p><pre><code>    int main(void) {
        setup();

Most notably, my purpose and/or intentions in purchasing this known quantity are entirely irrelevant to the transaction.

People who want to be able to customize everything when no one else cares.<p>Ultimately I think the pseudo-anarchic development process doomed Linux on the desktop but some external factors didn't help, namely OSX. OSX really is ""good enough"" for anyone wanting a <i>nix desktop/laptop. Sure it has problems but it means the gap between it and Linux is just that much smaller. And with Linux you give up great hardware (to varying degrees) and a snappy and </i>consistent* UI/UX.<p>The company that has had the most success putting Linux interfaces in people's hands is, of course, Google with Android (disclaimer: I work for Google). And even there the principality problem has created a fragmentation nightmare as different vendors seek to ""differentiate"" themselves.<p>Phones and tablets of course don't have the same expectation and technical legacy that desktops do (from X11 on up). Hell, Apple did the same thing with iOS (essentially forking OSX).<p>Audio is another problem. Peripherally I've had to deal with PulseAudio and it really is a solution looking for a problem. Graphics drivers are another issue. AMD/ATI and nVidia have of course not helped matters here.<p>I think Canonical had a chance to make a real impact here but they essentially blew it.",1346617971

We looked at different database solution when rewriting our current webshop and Firebird was something we looked at, but because we're a Python shop we dropped it. I'm not saying that the current Python driver doesn't work, it does, but it doesn't seem to be updated very infrequently and it's still seems more like an InterBase driver than a Firebird driver.

It's been established that there's an interest in applications of this nature.
The web is littered with concept art, mockups, and promises of 'silver bullet' applications of every conceivable type.
Daydreaming about merging the best features from a menagerie of rockstar apps is a pastime older than many of us here.
So, what separates this mockup from other similar vagaries & pipe dreams?
Has crowdsourced curation reached a tipping point towards the worse on HN?
My opinion on the matter would seem to be that of the minority...",1346616097

Pizza money. And bragging rights.<p>This app is basically in maintenance mode though I have a lot of things I want to do with it.

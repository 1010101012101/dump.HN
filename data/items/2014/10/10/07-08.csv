8436694,comment,8435936,8435936,0,0,tzs,,,"> A report, “Misogyny on Twitter,” released by the research and policy organization Demos this June, found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter between December 26, 2013, and February 9, 2014.<p>It&#x27;s worth clicking through to the actual report [1]. For the several words they look at, they don&#x27;t just count them. They break them down by gender of the tweeter, by comments (tweets about the word itself) and conversations (tweets where the word was used as part of the conversation), and how the word was used (non-offensive, colloquial, misogynistic, and so on).<p>For &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;whore&quot; in conversation, there is a really strong periodic component. The graph looks like a triangle waveform, with a big spike at the peak of the peak. It&#x27;s probably a 24 hour period, but I can&#x27;t really read it well because (for no reason that I can discern) they have used a spacing for the time grid lines of 1 day, 3 hours, 47 minutes?! See figure 5.<p>Figure 6 shows &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;whore&quot; in conversation tweets by gender. The graphs for males and females are nearly identical. They mention this in their &quot;Key findings&quot; section:<p><pre><code>   Women are as almost as likely as men to use the\n   terms ‘slut’ and ‘whore’ on Twitter. Not only are\n   women using these words, they are directing them at\n   each other, both casually and offensively; women are\n   increasingly more inclined to engage in discourses\n   using the same language that has been, and continues\n   to be, used as derogatory against them.\n</code></pre>\nIs it misogynistic for a woman to call another women, with offensive intent, a slut or whore? Or is she simply being a jerk?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.demos.co.uk/files/MISOGYNY_ON_TWITTER.pdf?1399567516"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demos.co.uk/files/MISOGYNY_ON_TWITTER.pdf?1399567...</a>",1412927800

8436687,comment,8432703,8436227,0,0,Zarel,,,"To be precise, 「ー」 is mostly only used to extend vowels when it wouldn&#x27;t change what Japanese/Chinese word it&#x27;s referring to. For instance, 「お」 can mean &quot;honorable&quot;, but 「おう」 means &quot;king&quot; and 「おお」 means &quot;large&quot;. If you wanted to convey that you&#x27;re saying &quot;honorable&quot; but dragging it out, you&#x27;d write it like 「おー」 such as in 「おーにいーさん」 (&quot;Brooooother&quot;), so it wouldn&#x27;t be confused with 「おう」 or 「おお」 even though it&#x27;d be pronounced the same way.<p>You could think of it this way: if you wanted to convey that you were saying the word &quot;god&quot; but stretching it out, the Japanese solution would be to write it as &quot;go–d&quot; (since &quot;good&quot; would have it be confused with a different word).<p>(This isn&#x27;t the only way to convey that a long vowel in hiragana isn&#x27;t semantic, though. It&#x27;s also common to write the vowel in small font, such as 「あぁぁ」 or 「ねぇ」)<p>You can also write things that are usually written in katakana in hiragana instead. This makes it look softer, and is similar to the idea of writing English without capitalizing words (such as at the beginning of sentences). In these cases, you&#x27;d still use ー as if you were using katakana, such as in the song title 「とらぶるめーかー」 (&quot;Troublemaker&quot;, the opening theme song from the anime Himegoto).",1412927613

That&#x27;s a good application; it&#x27;s slow, and you can have sensors all around the car to avoid hitting anything. A more general system that can put a car into a big parking garage or lot is quite possible. Cooperating parking garages might have some additional bar-code markers and maybe a data link for open space info.<p>The whole airport car-rental thing could be done automatically, using slow-speed automatic driving to bring the car up to a pickup point at the terminal, just as the renter gets there.

The type system has been expressly adjusted to allow for safe data-parallel libraries though, so they will appear.<p>Also, a few other points:<p>- Rust allows for opting in to unsafe code (with rules and overhead similar to C), which can be used for performance optimisations. Last time I checked, none of the Rust benchmark programs used any unsafe. (On the other hand, all of the C programs are effectively using `unsafe` code always)<p>- C is using highly optimised libraries; Rust has zero overhead FFI, and so can easily call into them, but is not for those benchmark (e.g. the pidigits one is just a benchmark of &quot;are you using GMP?&quot;, if the Rust was written to use it, there is no reason it would be slower than C)<p>- The worst offender (reverse-complement) is apparently written without any thought of performance, e.g. it is doing formatted IO for each and every character it emits, rather than writing to an in-memory buffer and dumping that in one go like the C.<p>In summary, those benchmarks do not reflect the fundamental speeds of the languages, other than the suboptimal SIMD support in Rust.",1412926615

8436627,comment,8432423,8435351,0,0,Animats,,,"True. You can also get rid of the motor entirely and just use proportional valves and compressed air. Festo&#x27;s robots work that way.<p>A common model of human and animal muscles is to treat them as two opposed springs, where the spring constant and neutral point are both adjustable.  Mechanical systems for that have been built for research robots, but they&#x27;re mechanical nightmares of cables, pulleys, and springs. Two opposed air cylinders, though, can directly implement a pair of adjustable springs.  That&#x27;s been done a few times on research robots. This gives you muscles of adjustable softness, just like humans.  A running robot with spring-type energy recovery could potentially be done that way.  (Humans recover about 60-70% of energy from one stride to another when running.  Cheetahs, 90%.)  Mechanical running machines with springs for energy recovery have been built.  With fixed springs tuned for running, all they can do is run.<p>To make soft air springs work, you need position and pressure feedback on everything, and small, fast servovalves.  Fast servovalves tend to be very expensive.  They also have to be near the cylinders for good position control - too much air line and there&#x27;s no way you can make the system stiff when you want to. Of course, you need compressed air.<p>Meanwhile, brushless DC motors have improved so much, and are so easy to control now, that the trend is away from pneumatics and hydraulics.  Boston Dynamics&#x27; humanoid is all hydraulic (it&#x27;s really a modified Big Dog), but Schaft&#x27;s is all electric. Google now owns both, of course.",1412925899

So I&#x27;m painfully aware of the problems of automatic driving.<p>You need to be both looking at the road with cameras and profiling it with LIDAR. (Or terahertz radar, once that gets going.)  It&#x27;s not enough to just sense the car ahead. You need to be able to detect potholes, ice patches, junk on the highway, small animals, and similar problems.  We could detect and avoid potholes back in 2005.  Since we were doing off-road driving, that was a normal driving event.<p>The reason for a high-view LIDAR is that you want to see the pavement surface ahead from a reasonably useful angle and get a 3D profile of the road ahead.  Google uses the Velodyne spinning-cone LIDAR scanner, which is a lot of LIDAR units built into one rotating mechanism.  That&#x27;s a research tool. There are other LIDAR devices more suited to mass production.  Advanced Scientific Concepts has a nice eye-safe LIDAR which can operate in full sunlight. It costs about $100K, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s made by hand for DoD and space applications.  The technology is all solid state, not inherently that expensive, and needs to be made into a volume product. (Somebody really needs to get on that. In 2004, I took a venture capitalist down to Santa Barbara to meet that crowd, but there was no mass market in sight back then. Now there is.)<p>You can only profile the road out to a limited distance, regardless of the sensor, because you&#x27;re looking at the road from an oblique angle. Under good conditions, though, you can out-drive the range at which you can profile the road.  That was Sebastian Thrun&#x27;s contribution, and won the DARPA Grand Challenge. The idea is that if the LIDARs say the near road is good, and the cameras say the far road looks like the near road, you can assume the far road is like the near road and go fast. If the far road looks funny, you have to slow down and get a good look at the road profile with the LIDARs.<p>Automatic driving systems have to do all this.  &quot;Driver assistance&quot; systems don&#x27;t.  Hence the &quot;deadly valley&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s just to deal with roads and static obstacles. Then comes dealing with traffic.",1412924954

Those services are more like everybody at once all lumped together whether they like it or not. In the real world things like proximity and social interdependency force people to be more measured in behavior, interactions are mediated by cliques and groups with reputations and social pressure. In focused online communities you can make assumptions about content because it&#x27;s opt-in and there is infinite space for alternative communities. I guess what I am getting at is that Twitter and Facebook are bad systems in that they don&#x27;t give us bearings to make good social decisions on how to act (usually the opposite.) Facebook might actually be worse than Twitter in that it simulates communities but really a planet ruled by a weird dictatorship that doesn&#x27;t care too much if you kill your neighbors as long as you don&#x27;t embarrass the government. Twitter is like as if you have an instant 1-1 connection with every other living being which is why you get situations where a million people are each slamming the same person with one insult. It&#x27;s horrifying but it&#x27;s also very clearly not recognizable as a natural sort of social interaction so you shouldn&#x27;t even expect it to be sane. It is a thing that literally should not exist. Something resembling Facebook could exist and be good, just not the Facebook we have now.",1412924858

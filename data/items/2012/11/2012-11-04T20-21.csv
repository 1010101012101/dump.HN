When some revolution in the interfaces will happen, and new methods will replace keyboards mouses and wide screens - then one can say the classic PC is obsolete.

If that were the case, then why does it take so long for people to overthrow the regimes in decidedly corrupt third-world dictatorships, like Libya, or Egypt? Those states were well known to be corrupt and unsustainable, yet it still took decades before Qaddaffi and Mubarak were overthrown.<p>The fact is, a court system needs a way to enforce it's judgement. Such enforcement necessarily requires force. And once a court system has a monopoly (or near monopoly) on force, then it becomes very difficult and painful to get rid of that court system and replace it with a competitor. In fact, we have a name for that process: revolution, and it's not exactly as easy as you make it out to be.",1352062633

One of the typical arguments, repeated in the article, is that the questions on a test require some cultural background and a smart person can fail them if they were raised in a different culture.<p>Following a similar line of reasoning, we could say that the vision test your optometrist administers requires the cultural context, after all if you were raised in a culture that uses cyrillic then you might not recognize some characters, and you would fail the test even if your vision was 20/20!

After all, IQ is a metric, not a direct measurement, as intelligence isn't itself directly observable.  If we're defining 'intelligence' as being a quality of the human mind that's conducive to success at achieving one's goals, then it becomes something of a tautology to simply ascribe that quality to people who have observably achieved their goals.<p>If the IQ metric is intended to correlate success on certain types of tests with success in other contexts, then it may be reliable in certain regards - e.g. people with higher IQs do tend to hive higher incomes, as 3pt14159 pointed out below - but the actual nature of that common causality is still something that may not itself be understood sufficiently to describe it in terms of dimensionality.",1352062528

They were never that popular a purchase in the first place, but because they never got deep into the games and computer culture, phone and tablet products are adequate for their needs, and have some advantages.<p>The main advantage is always-on mobile networking, so that sms, twitter, email, facebook, etc. are always available everywhere.  It's also a phone and a camera.<p>The clearest evidence I have of this shift is observing coworkers who don't have internet at home, or lack a PC at home.  They tend to run a lot more apps on their iphones and android phones.  I'd say, typically, a dozen or more.  The phone <i>is</i> their computer.  They also are considering tablets.<p>Personally, I make data: text, code, graphics, and now videos etc.  My PC is my primary platform.  My satellite system is my netbook.  My smartphone is a distant third.  I have maybe eight apps on my two smartphones: This American Life, Facebook, Twitter, GasBuddy, LATimes (just a bookmark really), Google Maps (again, a bookmark), RedLaser, Cut the Rope, and some visual mandala thing.<p>I don't feel like I need a tablet.  I'm probably going to get one, because I've been writing toy apps on android... but that's partly for my resume.<p>Tablets are just like video game consoles.  They're going to be more popular than general purpose PCs and will be a huge market, for better or worse. The PC made a lot of people smarter.  It taught people to control their computers, and even to program them.  It created a culture of creativity.  It was kind of like buying a car, and then finding there's a set of tools and a small machine shop in the trunk.  We lose all of that with tablets.<p>A tablet is like a car with the hood bolted shut, and a gas cap that only lets you fill up at specific gas stations.  It's fine for mechanics and the gas stations, but crap for drivers.<p>Mhyrvold's prediction wasn't quite right though.<p>Early demand was not for videophone.  It was for sms and twitter and email.  Low-bandwidth, immediate services.  The killer video app is still video on demand.  High costs for data impede some applications.<p>Price was not cheaper by an order of magnitude.  It was around half, or a bit more than half.<p>Gaming has been consuming CPU so quickly that it became its own category of computer.<p>Gaming, videophone and phone have only started to work on the internet in the past five years or so.

A couple of interesting, relatively recent documentaries on the subject are ""Born Rich""[1] and ""The One Percent""[2].<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342143/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342143/</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0819791/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0819791/</a>",1352059632

It does not restrict the underlying concept of ""tiny round magnets""; if there was a high school science project that needed them, for instance, it would remain lawful to sell them for that.<p>Here's the specific proposed language:<p><i>any aggregation of separable, permanent magnetic objects that is a consumer product intended or marketed by the manufacturer primarily as a manipulative or construction desk toy for general entertainment, such as puzzle working, sculpture, mental stimulation, or stress relief</i><p>It's pretty much as simple as ""you can't market magnets like this as novelty items"", and that's it. That seems reasonable to me.<p>You could probably set up a business selling them as a lab supply to nerds knowing full well that 99.999% of your sales were to people using them as desk toys; as long as you aren't inducing the public into using easily ingestible rare earth magnets as desk toys, you're probably fine.",1352059419

While waiting for an ambulance he 'died' (no heart beat, no respiration, no signs of life at all, blue lips and gums) and I immediately did CPR on him until the ambulance arrived. Months later I learnt that he survived.<p>Any brush with death makes you seriously think about your own mortality. I know that watching this stranger's eyes go dead was quite life changing for me.",1352059384
4740825,comment,4740281,4740522,2,0,anothermachine,,,"1. Someone named ""mistercow"" is obviously biased on this question.<p>2. Another item to factor in, beyond lookup table size, is that questions are written in English, and the medium (spelled words) should not be snuck in as part of the content, except where sometimes it is done intentionally :)
Also, in classification problems like these, one should also consider not just how efficiently a solution chooses an answer from the set, but also how cleanly it isolates the cluster of items in question from the unnamed items. That is, since [cow,hen,pig,sheep] are all animals, more so than a random word is, animality should be part of the rule used to choose among them.<p>3. As blauwbilgorgel notes, Google's very successful solution to model picking is to slurp of everything published publicly online (and with Books, also many things published offline) and sample over the combined output of humanity. This is still biased towards written text, published text, and loquaciousness, but it's pretty good.",1352059378

I've already paid my pound of flesh to get my work done, intentionally not backporting a dongle driver to force upgrades at $10k a whack is the stuff slime is made of. They do this because they know very well there are not many/any alternative vendors for this equipment, which happens to be an exotic motion capture rig absolutely critical to my work. Fuck that and fuck anyone who tells me I have to grin and bear it or otherwise just wave my hands and go without all because otherwise I might offend their sensibilities over how I might see <i>their</i> software. Personally, I don't care about your software. It hasn't done anything slimy to me yet. You're safe.",1352059319
4740821,comment,4739356,4739857,2,0,klibertp,,,"I read somewhere that attitude is what matters; for example, if you have one great guy in your team, who happens to be cynical, pessimistic and such it's going to hurt overall performance of the team compared to the same team without that guy. Or something like that. I don't know, but this seems to be something you'd like to take into account if you're hiring.<p>But my main point is different. First, if your job has certain elements to it that you don't like and you don't feel like you have the resolve to do those things (for whatever reason) you should just change jobs. And second, I find your statement that ""passion fades"" unfounded. It didn't fade for me and it was about twenty years so far and counting. It's the same for OP, it seems. And I do have (enough of a) life, have great SO (with whom I'm together for almost as long as I code!), and so on; it still didn't change a thing (ok, it may be that I'm now trying to plan more things in advance but that's it).<p>As for those ""problems you do not love"" - I genuinely don't have them anymore. Right, there always is some frustration, sometimes anger, but I think these emotions are a testament to my love for all these problems: I wouldn't feel them if I didn't care, right?<p>So, while it's not necessary to be true scotsman - genuinely passionate - it changes much if you are. I say ""scotsman"", because I would like to think that passion that fades is not a true one... Maybe I'm wrong. We need to wait another twenty years to be sure :)",1352059301

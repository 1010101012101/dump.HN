Since you need twitch responsive communications for take-off and landing.<p>Once the drone is in the air if it loses communications with the ground then it just either flies it predetermined route or at least flies straight and level until communications are re-established.<p>The problem here seems to be that people both on the military side and contractor side are cutting tons of corners and we are starting to see the fallout from that here.<p>I think failure to communicate with ATC (e.g. taking off without permission) is a massive concern. If a traditional pilot did that then they would soon have their licence ripped up, not sure why drone pilots aren't held to the same standard.",1354363109

I'm not saying it's the same case here, but knowing Apple's preference towards a compact and efficient use of space, I wouldn't rule it out.<p>Definitely agree with you on your marketing point. If it can be proven incorrect then it's not ok (nor is it legal). I think they use the word ""revolutionary"" in place of the old go-to ""best"". Everyone can say they're the best because it can't be proven wrong. It's subjective. Take, for example, a smartphone screen.

4857414,comment,4856986,4857363,4,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"I do not understand how the physics of a ram afterburner would work. A ram duct generates compression via aerodynamic drag. It slows and compresses the air forced into it by controlling shocks.<p>The expansion stage of a brayton cycle engine maximizes exhaust velocity rearward and hence by Newton's third law creates thrust. Constricting the exhaust will only reduce efficiency.<p>If you're talking about an expansion duct with secondary combustion, that has nothing to do with ram effect and is just an afterburner.<p>By and large afterburners are hideously inefficient, but many military craft still include them because it is easier to manufacture an afterburner tolerant of secondary combustion temperatures than a turbine. SABRE erodes this motivation as the incident temperature into the flame holders (or rocket nozzles) is dramatically lower than common in a turbine engine, so you can get more of the energy possible from the oxygen density of the engine's intake flow without secondary combustion.",1354362373

Compound statements are those, like the if- and while-statements, which require multiple lines.<p>Only simple statements may be separated by a ';', not compound statements.<p>This is a bit different than what you wrote. For example, ""x=4"" is a statement, and not an expression, but ""x=4;y=5;z=6"" is a valid Python line because assignment is a simple statement, and multiple simple statements may be separated by a ';'.",1354360261

I am not sure if the sonic boom was nearly as big a problem as it was made out to be. I think we can do some cursory math.<p>If 30% was at 50% of the speed, the total distance covered would be 85% less, adding about 20% flight time increase. Something that normally takes 8+ hours now take 3 or 4 hours. Did this kill the concord?",1354360246

A number of physicists, notably Egil Lillestl at the University of Bergen, have talked to official figures about this for a long time about this without getting any kind of traction.<p>Thorium energy seems to be a very promising candidate for safe, clean and cheap next-generation nuclear power. If these researchers manage to develop something without official support, it would be impressive indeed. That the Norwegian government isn't willing to support clean energy research is really quite baffling, given that the energy sector is hands-down the largest contributor to the Norwegian economy. And Norway has the world's second-largest known thorium reserves. For all our supposed good policies, we are still subject to mob rule and completely uninformed detractors.",1354360106

It's like comparing over-powered motorbikes in the hands of reckless teenagers with school buses.<p>The original justification for deploying drones over manned aircraft was that the drones could be built cheaper -- no expensive aircrew to risk in event of a crash, so less need for complex safety systems and multiple redundancy. Now put this cheap, cheerful, and not terribly safe device in the hands of a lowest-bidder contractor's hired help, who may or may not have been hired because they were cheap rather than able to do the job ...<p>And now imagine the bikers in this metaphor are riding on a stretch of road used by buses, are ignoring the traffic signs, and that a crash will kill everyone involved (including the full bus), and you've got a grasp of the picture we're looking at here.",1354359914

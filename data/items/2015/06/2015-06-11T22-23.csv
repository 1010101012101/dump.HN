9702962,comment,9702179,9702688,0,0,dynamicdispatch,,,"Depends on the company you&#x27;re interviewing with. But here&#x27;s a description of how companies who insist on culture fit evaluate candidates.<p>Generally an onsite interview comprises of a series (minimum 2, may go up to 4) of technical interviews which might involve whiteboard coding or coding on a laptop (my current company use this approach - partly inspired by Stripe&#x27;s interview process where candidates are told to bring their own laptops and use their language/editor/IDE of choice). The coding itself should take anything from 20 (very strong candidates) to 40 minutes, and the remaining 15-20 mins is used to ostensibly allow the interviewee to the interviewer(s) questions, and sometimes these questions/discussions are used to assess culture fit. Like, is the interviewee opinionated about something (which is them used to &#x27;score&#x27; the interviewee between 1-10 on &#x27;ego&#x27;).<p>Some companies insist on &#x27;lunch&#x27; with the candidate, which WOULD be nice if you&#x27;re having lunch with your team members/engineers, but a lot of times these you&#x27;re just shown the way to the cafeteria and told to help yourselves, where you  find yourself among a sea of strangers laughing/talking about something and you try making small talk (if you&#x27;re socially awkward or introverted, you fail this test right away). Now, not all companies&#x27; lunch interviews are this bad, but some just insist on one and do NOTHING to make the interviewee feel at home (maybe that&#x27;s the whole point?).<p>Then there would be a separate &#x27;culture fit&#x27; interview AFTER all the coding interviews, usually with the CTO/VP of Engineering/Director of Engineering. This would entail being either asked to rate yourself on a scale of 1-10 on specific tools/technologies, asked about how you deal with conflicts, how you disagree with others when you have to, what side projects you work on and so forth.<p>At some companies, a culture fit interview is an interview with non-technical folk, who&#x27;ll ask you for the UMPTEENTH time why you want to work at this company, what are your hobbies, what do you do during your weekends/in your free time, what are your favorite bars, where do you hike/work out, what books you read, what artists you listen to yada yada.<p>Some companies also insist on the candidate grabbing drinks/breakfast with current employees. I&#x27;ve done a &#x27;breakfast&#x27; interview where ALL the engineers were drunk to varying degrees (they&#x27;d just had a huge party the previous evening). Generally, this is again a way of seeing if the candidate is someone you&#x27;d like to grab drinks with, or would like to hang out with socially after work. Depending on the company,  this might involve speaking about tech, or as often as not, not saying a word about the job and just treating it like an evening/morning with old friends.<p>It&#x27;s hard to know what <i>exactly</i> to say, and one has to walk the tightrope between sounding and seeming confident and cool and NOT coming across as egoistic/too opinionated and obnoxious. A lot of times, the same answers garner different responses from different teams, and in general, I personally believe these kind of interviews/questions should be banned since it&#x27;s really no indicator of skill. The people I enjoy hanging out with may not always be the people I want to <i>work</i> with 40 hours a week. Unfortunately, likability is a major factor that goes into the hiring decision.",1434062945

I randomly would feel like I was about to have a heart attack, with all the symptoms including my arm going numb, sharp pain in or across the chest, etc. Doctors were all mixed on what it was (they were all certain it wasn&#x27;t cardiovascular, but that didn&#x27;t make me feel any better, because it sure seemed like it was; and my father died in his 50s of a heart attack).

It was of course esophageal spasms. Hot liquids, things with caffeine, and physical activity would agitate or stimulate the esophagus and vagus nerve. After some experimentation, I found that the damage wasn&#x27;t healing, because routine things continued to agitate it; what would otherwise be normal amounts of acid were contributing to the problem.

Without any indication of what the dose-response curve is other than it has a positive slope (at what significance level?) we know nothing about the relevance of this result to clinical practice.<p>For example, it is true that if you pay very careful attention to the sidewalk you will <i>increase</i> the amount of dropped money you find. It&#x27;s not going to make anyone rich, though, any more than just any measurable effect is going to make one less anxious to a useful degree. There is zero indication of how big the effect is, other than it is measureable in a large population. The lack of indication of effect size suggests that it is really small.<p>2) Self-report via recollection is a lousy data collection technique. Was a food log app really too much trouble? So the raw data are incredibly noisy and may contain systematic errors that are related to the phenomenon under test.<p>3) They&#x27;ve subsetted the data by pulling out neuroticism, thereby dramatically reducing the significance of any result by an unknown amount (how many other characteristics did they investigate?)<p>This is the greatest sin. <i>Any</i> time you see a paper that says, &quot;The effect was particularly large in sub-population X&quot; the first question to ask it, &quot;How many sub-populations did you look at?&quot; The next question to ask is, &quot;What is your calculated probability that <i>any one of</i> your sub-populations would have had such a large effect by chance?&quot; These numbers should be reported in the abstract because people subset their data all the time and then analyze the subset that shows an effect as if it was the only one. This is either incompetence or dishonesty.<p>Statisical significance rolls off with astonishing speed as you subset the data, and if you don&#x27;t have a formal discipline for subsetting as part of the experiment design that is fixed prior to analysis, any result on a subset is necessarily insignificant because you could have kept subsetting until you found a &#x27;significant&#x27; result.

Instead, I think there&#x27;s such a thing as Product/Culture fit. Different cultures unavoidably product different products and some products fail in the market because the culture that produced it never achieve Product/Market fit.<p>Take Lyft and Uber for example. Both are ostensibly doing very similar things yet I know people at both and I can confidently say very few people could work happily in both places. If you work at Uber, you have to be OK with stripping an entire research lab to build up your self driving car department. If you work at Lyft, you have to be OK that Lyft hasn&#x27;t expanded internationally yet as they&#x27;re cautiously focusing on the US.<p>Even though Lyft and Uber are looking for the same skillset in their employees, the pools they&#x27;re hiring from are almost completely distinct. People interpret &quot;not a culture fit&quot; as a negative thing, as if it&#x27;s about that person not being good enough for the company&#x27;s culture. Instead, when &quot;not a culture fit&quot; is said honestly, it simply means that, even though both of you want to accomplish the same things, you want to accomplish them in different ways and there&#x27;s other, better places for your talents.<p>Similarly, companies should look long and hard at their Product/Culture fit and, if they do indeed find it lacking on some ways, actively recruit people who have the force of will to alter their culture.

It takes the same codebase and just generates a different product from it.<p>Switching to a different OS, however, requires different <i>development-time</i> technologies. Some third-party dependencies like libraries you&#x27;re used to using might not even exist on the other platform.<p>Effectively, developers are locked into a pretty <i>tiny</i> development-time ecosystem: all the devs I know develop on Ubuntu (or on OSX with testing on Ubuntu, if they can get away with it.) They depend on the apt package graph, including PPAs.<p>Half of the renewed enthusiasm behind containers isn&#x27;t about security; it&#x27;s about the fact that a lot of operations people prefer RPM-based distros, and it was always really annoying to try to keep a given piece of Linux software portable between deb-based and RPM-based distros. You needed to figure out how to specify operation-time dependencies against at least two package graphs, and also compile-time dependencies using autotools or similar.<p>In contrast, Docker and similar ops software are interesting (from one perspective) precisely because they let devs <i>learn fewer things</i>: you develop your software on your Ubuntu machine, create a container that basically replicates your development environment, &quot;install&quot; your software in there, and then distribute that. Now your software can be run on some other dev&#x27;s (Ubuntu, OSX) machine, or deployed to a production (RHEL) machine. The other deployment scenarios are pretty minor in comparison.<p>Or, in short: devs and ops are separate jobs. Containers make ops people do more work/learn more things, but let devs do less work/learn fewer things. That&#x27;s why devs are enthusiastic about them: it pushes the work of packaging their software (or writing autoconf scripts) for various platforms off their plate.<p>Devs are interested in learning one thingâ€”e.g. how to write a Dockerfileâ€”that lets them drop an entire stream of continuous work/learning/keeping-up they have to do, e.g. handling changes in the multiple platforms their software supports.",1434061251

The few I have seen have been the ones who have done executive MBAs (mainly people with a lot of experience going to get some theory knowledge) and they apply very little and very specific knowledge from their MBA.<p>My favorite experience with &#x27;fresh&#x27; MBA students (still in university, no real work experience) was when I sat on a panel of local expat business people (in the Czech republic) doing a Q and A for MBA students from the US somewhere. They came off a day of exploring Prague, and had sat through some chamber of commerce and Ministry of Trade and Industry presentations so our panel was up to talk about our real world experiences building businesses out here. We all gave a short speech about what we&#x27;ve done and lessons learned out here-specifically what is great about business out here but also what pitfalls to look out for- then opened up for questions from the students.<p>The first question came from a student who I think was trying to emulate a hard-nosed, no nonsense businessman, who quite aggressively asked &quot;Hold on, hold on hold on! So, can you just tell me whether I should bring my business here or not? The first presentations are telling me that everything is wonderful out here, now you lot tell me it&#x27;s not so easy. So which is it then?!?&quot;<p>I (admittedly a little bit annoyed, as I was doing the panel for free, I just wanted to help some future business people out) said to her: &quot;Your job as a business owner is to gather data, evaluate it and make what <i>you</i> think is a sound decision based on it. You saw basically 2 sets of presentations today, one from people who are selling the Czech Republic, and one from foreigners who have actually built businesses here. So, <i>you</i> need to evaluate both sides of the coin, and come up with <i>your own</i> decision. If you can&#x27;t do that you may well end up buying a lot of bridges and investing blindly in things that can&#x27;t fail.&quot;<p>That gathered a few laughs, and even the woman who asked came up to me afterwards and asked me a few more questions (but still in a bullish type of way). But the local Chamber of commerce and the ministry never invited me again to be a panel member.<p>That was a round about way of trying to say that newly minted MBAs, their heads full of case studies, tends to see the business world in shades of black and white. That theories always work, that the business would be successful if you only did <i>this</i>. But the real world tends to be a little more murky, and until those MBAs gain a little more experience and are granted a little wisdom, they offer very little more value than an interesting tweet.",1434061187

Some of these ideas are deep beliefs, where the question is simply how the outside will react to hearing about them.  Some of them are fragments of arguments he&#x27;s trying to piece together, in the hope that the process of writing will clear things up in his own mind.  Others are probably there simply because he was drawn in the cadence of the language.<p>But I do think that Moldbug is consciously a persona, and not identical to Yarvin.

Yes, the writing is racist by the current way the word is used to label practically any belief in racial differences.

Don&#x27;t hire minorities, because you might lose your job if accused of racial prejudice?<p>In such an environment, silence is likely the best strategy.

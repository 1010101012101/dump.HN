6236702,comment,6236478,6236673,8,0,RyanZAG,,,"That happens less in academics - I was thinking more of administrative areas in corporations. For example, there are no shortages of stories of administrators in procurement adding in additional required paperwork when more efficient computerized systems make their stamp on documents less required.<p>Actually, this has happened in academics in a way too - consider the requirement of ever lengthening literature reviews in PHD theses. These have come about because of the ease of access to academic documents through digitized journals making libraries and supervisors less valuable. The answer is to increase their value by increasing the amount of work required so that they will still be necessary to wade through it. I&#x27;m not sure how much this is sabotage and not just the result of electronic journals making this easier though, which is why the example in the paragraph above is far more relevant.",1376913508

An &quot;explicit model&quot; is a &quot;cycle accurate model&quot; because the simulation goes through all the actual motions that the real target (CPU) would do.<p>Behavioral models are much faster but less detailed and sometimes less accurate.

The author does make the point that it might also be the people themselves pushing for it, at least.<p>The &#x27;ruling class&#x27; really doesn&#x27;t care if anybody is or isn&#x27;t working pointless jobs. Society as a whole is forcing people into pointless jobs by viewing anybody who is unemployed as some kind of failure. When a child gets out of school they need to find work or they have failed. If someone has no job their perceived lack of purpose ultimately pushes them into mental illness, drug abuses or even suicide. This has nothing to do with someone forcing people to work and everything to do with the human brain&#x27;s need for purpose forcing working - even if that work is pointless. For example, you often hear someone say with pride how they have worked so much they don&#x27;t have time to eat or sleep even when the work they are doing is something like filling out pointless bureaucratic paperwork.<p><i>&quot;How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labour when one secretly feels ones job should not exist?&quot;</i><p>Most people in these kind of jobs actually believe that the job is necessary.

You need to see them as a whole, for the same reason as why you can&#x27;t make sense out of an animal if you mainly see it as the sum of its individual cells.<p>From a biologist&#x27;s point of view, they need to compete for resources, they show some adaptability, they reproduce themselves with some amount of mutation: they have everything needed to benefit from Darwinian selection, and they do.<p>The resulting current generation of bureaucracies has evolved a very good effectiveness at diverting resources, from other consumers including humans, towards themselves (that is, maintaining and growing the bureaucracy itself).<p>As a result, they exhibit many &quot;intelligent&quot; traits, including some selfish sense of purpose. Conspiracy theorists wrongly look for The Man, the mastermind driving bureaucracies. There&#x27;s none, no more than there&#x27;s a single neuron nor small group thereof which drives your brains: a complex enough bureaucracy has a non-human mind of its own.<p>Keynes was right about the amount of work we&#x27;d need, what he failed to predict is a phenomenon very similar to eutrophisation: we dream of full employment when we don&#x27;t need to, so we produce much more &quot;nutrients&quot; (people willing to offer their workforce) than we can use for survival and human enjoyment. So instead of being consumed by/for homo sapiens, this energy is consumed by that competing life form that are bureaucracies.",1376912713

It&#x27;s quite a different language, much more so than Java compared to C# (1.0 even).<p>A couple of things of the top of my head:<p><pre><code>    * goroutines and efficient multithreading, both in terms of syntactical constructs and language implementation. Go doesn&#x27;t have await/async because it fundamentally doesn&#x27;t need them.
    * a type system that works without inheritance or subtypes but rather static duck typing, quite different from any other language
    * very memory efficient layout of data structures, internal pointers
    * small set of builtins with maps, slices, channels (that do have &#x27;generic&#x27; types for their members) to reuse, rather than re-implement
    * comes with a well designed build and packaging system
    * comes with a very convincing standard library
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s worth taking a look. C# surely is a nice language, but it inherited many of the design flaws of Java, in particular with respect to the runtime and memory layout. Google does use Java internally a lot, Go gets uptake in spite of that competition.<p>Regardless of language merits, licensing C# can indeed be a problem, as can be the operational complexity of managing Windows running on hundreds, thousands, ten thousands etc of machines.",1376911941

Then remember that dozens to hundreds of people work on those games. Then repeat the phrase &quot;I dunno whether its a matter of expectations&quot; and think carefully about how that phrase applies to you.<p><i>Of course</i> hundreds of modders are going to end up fleshing out what one guy (and then a handful of guys) could not. The nether system being &quot;pretty sorry&quot; at release is almost a parody of a statement. If it&#x27;s not meant to be, I guess the implication is that he should have released it only after &quot;finishing&quot; it? Or not added features at all, instead focusing on more core features? Those approaches have a massive hidden assumption that alternate-universe-Notch would have taken those paths and then focussed on features you wanted, rather than spending months, on, say, making a higher height limit, or better biome distribution, or better cow grazing behavior, etc etc all of which would not have added substantially to the fun of playing the game.<p>Minecraft was and is an incredibly fun game. I&#x27;m not suggesting you should kiss the feet of every stray thought Notch has, but I find the people that write these kinds of posts have lost any sort of perspective.<p>Think of the number of elaborate and most of all <i>actually fun</i> games written by one person that have not only shipped to players, but also were fun to play at every stage of an open development process. The number is tiny, and the reason is that it&#x27;s really really hard. Maybe people don&#x27;t have game making experience? Making games is hard, making a fun game is much much harder, and making a fun game out of a bunch of different interlocking systems that is relatively bug free is basically a miracle if we look at an existing games to attempted games ratio.<p>Now, whether or not Notch owes you updates to the Nether for life for your $15 for Minecraft is a whole other story, but Minecraft has been fun to play in every incarnation I&#x27;ve played since Alpha. Calling his work half-assed is bullshit, even if we only compare his output to the actual output of every other aspiring video game maker that has ever existed.

At the same time, ask for a flat rate to the airport including tolls (airports are typically flat rates from most cities), and whether or not they accept your method of payment. Or, if you&#x27;re hailing a taxi on the street which typically takes a minute or two in any major city, ask the driver before you get in for a rate, and see if he accepts your card.<p>I&#x27;ve taken taxis in a dozen different countries around the world, and I never remember a taxi that was particularly dirty. I took three rides with strangers last weekend, and 2 of the 3 I had to move papers, books, bags, etc off their seat before I had room to sit down. They also had papers on the floor, and the odd empty bottle rolling back and forth under the seat. I don&#x27;t mind either, but on average I find taxis to be cleaner.<p>Sure you can rate a taxi. The first thing I do when I arrive in an untrustworthy city is checkout taxi reviews. There are always companies that will charge you 2 or 3 times the typical rate because you&#x27;re not from the area, but at the same time, there are always a couple reliable businesses that people swear by, and you save their number, of watch for their taxi when waving them down on the street.",1376911580

115199,comment,115085,115184,0,0,projectileboy,,,"Thank you very much for the breakdown. I still don't see the benefit, however. Saying that you don't have an official repository is just semantics, because someone will in fact be responsible for the final merge, and that's going to be the official repository, whether you call it that or not. Furthermore, the code all has to get merged in the end. How does it simplify thing to merge from C --> B --> A --> Official, rather than just have everyone merging against an official repository?<p>Again, I'm not trolling - I ask these questions because I'm working somewhere right now where they use Clearcase, which admittedly is a horrible, horrible, horrible tool, but which is being used in my current environment very much like a DVCS. Everyone feels ""productive"" because they can merge their branch into other folks' branches on an as needed basis. But the end result is freakin' chaos from the point of view of product management, because it takes - literally - weeks to get a completely merged codebase containing the entire product. How does a tool like Git help matters?",1202936397

115184,comment,115085,115157,0,0,rglullis,,,"The point of the distributed approach is precisely that you eliminate the need for a ""official"" repository.<p>If it seems pointless, consider a scenario where you have three separate teams (A, B, C) working on a product.<p>In a centralized approach, you'd want to create a branch for each team, have them working on their exclusive branch and have each of them make a merge to the main branch. If you are responsible for the ""main"" repository, you need to make three merges, one for A, one for B, one for C. This is hard and gets even harder when the number of teams grows.<p>In a distributed approach, each team is able to pull stuff from the other teams any time and as they see fit. In that case, if you are the responsible for the ""main"" repository, you could establish a policy where you will only pull code from the C tree, and let C be responsible for pulling from B, and B from A. With this approach, each team is responsible only for one merge.",1202935408

I thought of implementing is as a DSL for businesses - let the ""tigers"" specify it in the DSL and then the implementation can be upgraded underneath the definition.  Naturally, Lisp would be a good fit.  I do enjoy the success of seeing customers achieve goals, but I prefer the tractability of engineering systems over the political systems of the real world.

I don't care as much about the karma of comments I guess.<p>So I would perhaps focus on that, because as a blogger and someone writting an app, I am unlikely to change the code of my systems to support your avatars, I would be happy if the comment tracking worked by default. Then I might point out the service to readers on my blog or make a link by the comments like ""track these comments with subavatar""<p>On your page I would show example screen shots of the avatars and comment tracking in action on some site.

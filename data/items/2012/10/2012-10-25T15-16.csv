4698080,comment,4698005,4698005,3,0,philiphodgen,,,"1.  This is happening all over the world, not just Switzerland.  Because of FATCA as well as the IRS's enforcement activities over the last few years, U.S. persons are seen as risky and expensive customers.  It's more profitable and less risky to send U.S. customers away than it is to make the IRS happy.<p>2.  It's worse for entrepreneurs.  I am now seeing my U.S. clients lose business opportunities outside the USA.  Would-be foreign partners are increasingly deciding that having an American in the company (as an owner and increasingly frequently as a mere employee) exposes the whole venture to too much U.S. government risk:<p>- The U.S. person will likely report on his/her/its ownership portion of the joint venture.  Typically this is Form 5471 for a corporation, for instance.  This causes financial data about the company to bleed over to the U.S. government from abroad.<p>- The U.S. person will likely have to disclose company bank accounts on Form TD F 90-22.1; this includes how much money is in the account as well as full bank details.<p>The privacy leaks are unacceptable to non-Americans.  Why should their business affairs be disclosed to the USA, when the business never touches the United States?  The easy solution is to reject the U.S. person who wants to be in business with them.  Which they do.<p>3.  The consequence:  I am seeing (and helping) an increasing number of entrepreneurs acquire a second citizenship then terminate their U.S. citizenship.  I'm afraid that I am seeing the beginning (for the USA) of what people say about Detroit:  ""The people with get-up-and-go got up and went.""<p>(Disclosure:  I am an international tax lawyer and I do this stuff in my day job.)<p>(Personal opinion:  All of that pessimism aside, let me just say that I experience frequent moments of gratitude when traveling abroad that I have the U.S. passport.  Yes, it is a Very Big World with Many Fabulous Places to Live.  But there are also some places where I am glad I can leave.)",1351180628

I don't buy it because there's still no sign of them trying to crack down on other alternative currencies such as Ithaca Hours.  And Ithaca Hours are, I believe, older and more well-established.<p>It wouldn't be the implication that the alternative currency has a cash value in US dollars, because Ithaca Hours are pegged at $10 per Hour.<p>I wonder if it's that the Liberty Dollars were issued by a for-profit organization rather than being community organized like other alternative currencies I'm aware of.  If I remember right, the ""dollar monopoly"" was originally enacted in response to the fracas around Civil War tokens.  During the war companies had been issuing their own scrip that started to be used as currency in the surrounding communities. There were a number of minor financial catastrophes that happened whenever the issuing company would stop honoring its scrip, thus causing the currency to collapse. And the scrip issuer essentially made off with however much US currency they had received in exchange for the script. So the government decided to ban that as a form of (at the time clearly much-needed) consumer protection.<p>Anyone who's more knowledgeable about the applicable law and its history who can comment?",1351179751

You have people who want to sell at rate X and people who want to buy at rate Y. These form the basis of the bid/ask pricing, if the values cross then the people involved can do a trade.<p>A retail currency exchange broker will add their spread on-top of the market bid-ask spread, but that doesn't alter the fact that there is a fundamental underlying spread caused by differing views among the buyers and sellers of the currency.<p>There's also not a single market which can have a mid-price. Currencies aren't like stocks where there's a single point where the trades happen. There are lots of currency markets and at any one point in time they'll have different fundamental bid/ask spreads (because of latency), you'll also have differences based upon volume and market depth, who's willing to trade with you, and the participants in that market (many bigger trades now happen in private dark pools).<p>So once you've picked what your definition of market is then you need to pick your definition of midpoint. Are you going to take the middle of the bid-ask, are you going to take the price the last actual trade was done at, or a volume-weighted average price, are you going to filter out momentary spikes, are you going to filter out prices from people who are purposefully market manipulating, etc. What about when there's low liquidity and price might be wildly off ?<p>And that's all stuff that's required to just arrive at a market price. You have to take a subjective view on every-one of these decisions, so in practice any serious market participant is going to have a slightly different view of what the market is for any currency.<p>On the point of offering a fixed single exchange rate, yes it's possible, but the the broker offering it (1) has to make their profit from somewhere other than the spread and (2) take the risk that if the market moves against them that they'll lose money (and again the cost of this has to be covered elsewhere).<p>(2) is actually a huge risk. If the market moves so your price is outside of the market bid-ask range then someone can arbitrage you and make risk free profit from your out of market price and basically bankrupt you. So to defend against this you either need to be able to stop transactions if this ever happens of put enough of a delay in your system so you can make sure this never happens.",1351179053

The centrifugal forces generated by unchecked rotation could cause blackout or even death.

Apple only addresses part of a larger market - i.e. consumer electronics v. general computing [analogs: IBM and corporate computing market, AOL and non-corporate market, Netscape and the web (but not the desktop), the former Apple not growing vertically within the corporate environment].<p>Microsoft has continued to be profitable and technologically relevant because it scratches it's own itches (and eats its own dogfood).<p>Microsoft depends on Visual Studio in it's workflow. It depends on Office, SQL Server, and [perhaps still] Project, in the same way. They gave a Surface and a Windows Phone to every employee because the design goal of those products is productivity for people who do the sort of things Microsoft's employees do.<p>Microsoft is a B2B company. It's business model allowed Michael Dell to become a billionaire. Even IBM, for all their B2B savvy, doesn't allow that sort of thing to happen.<p>Apple has adopted many aspects of the model of secrecy which led to the collapse of Boston as the center of the computing industry twenty odd years ago. It has rebuilt itself as an inward focused (and perhaps ironically, given the article, paranoid) company. Even the architecture of it's new headquarters reflects this.<p>What the Jobs-less Apple is missing is not competent designers, but a person who has insight into the inefficiencies within an entire industry. The initial success of the iPhone may have been largely a function of it's design. But it's explosive growth was driven by Jobs' ability to change the structure of cellphone data plans. Without cheap data rates and ubiquitous fast networks, smartphones are just another gizmo. His success with Pixar was likewise the ability exploit an inefficiency (finding a suitable computer alternative to hand drawn animation).",1351178473

If you see your LinkedIn profile, you will notice that apart from ads, a lot of the screen real-estate is used up by sections like ""Viewers of this profile also clicked on"". If you are sharing your profile with someone (for example a recruiter), these sections are not of any importance to you (or him).<p>I believe that this is where Engem comes in. It helps you showcase only the stuff that you want people to know about you and it does so in a visually appealing manner.<p>Here's the link to my profile - <a href=""http://engem.me/bharani-muthukumaraswamy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engem.me/bharani-muthukumaraswamy</a><p>Let me know what you think about this.

Everything is a reference (a pointer), everything is a first-class object (could be passed anywhere), everything is an expression (uniform syntax).<p>Ironically, Clojure is, a Java in the land of Lisp. They broke the abstraction layers, mess up logic with implementation, introduce not just different kind of parenthesis, but redundant and irrelevant data-structures and ruined the magic of ""everything is a list"".

Were also exploring a self sustainable model in which incomplete task dollars are used to reward completed tasks. Also, instead of community redistribution, we could also base the multiplier on the amount of money that the user him/herself has given to us, giving customers a chance to make up more money faster as they get more behind on tasks, motivating them to get on track faster.<p>Question 3: Are there any downsides to the revenue model proposed whereby our best case is when our users have all incomplete tasks and lose a bunch of money?

I'm definitely going to play around with Ambrose's work.<p>Had a quick look, it's really exciting that the algo.monads was almost completely type-checkable with this system.<p>Leaves me with a couple of questions:<p>Multimethods are untyped. Anyone able to comment on how often multimethods are used in idiomatic Clojure code?<p>Anyone know if this work could eventually allow protocols to become full type-classes (allowing dispatch based on return type of protocol methods)? Am I misunderstanding how protocols are compiled?<p>Hopefully the videos for Typed Clojure at Clojure Conj 2012 will be posted soon after the talk is given :)<p>My only fear is that optional typing would be less useful than optional <i>untyping</i>.

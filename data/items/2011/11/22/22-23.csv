3267837,comment,3266455,3266455,1,0,cleaver,,,"In my experience (over a decade consulting to government in Canada), not charging enough can sometime put you at a competitive disadvantage. The purchasing decisions are often made by someone who doesn't understand the technology and their prime concern is risk. They don't want to be ""the guy who chose the vendor who screwed up"". In government, as often as not, you may not get promoted for doing something great so much as by not doing anything bad.<p>A lot of cost can be added through management of non-technical aspects. The wording may have to go through rounds of approval, goals and features may shift, etc. The cost of writing endless detailed RFP's and the long sales cycles increase the cost.<p>That said, there are also a lot of ""consultants"" who really are just crap. It made me embarrassed to be in the same business and that is part of the reason I don't work for government clients anymore.",1322002776

3267807,comment,3266455,3266455,26,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is definitely hacker-bait. Cue up all the folks complaining about wasteful government, then cue up the hotshot programmer folks who will tell us they can code this in 2 hours while drunk, then cue up the FOIA folks, then the folks who feel any critique at all of government is indicative of right-wing extremism, and so on.<p>I remember when the IRS spent 4 Billion on a new computer system <i>and had nothing to show for it</i>. The joke I used for a week was ""Hell, they could have paid me $2 Billion and still not had anything to show for it -- and saved half their money.""<p>The problem those of us with lots of internal government experience is that most ""normal"" folks have literally no idea how much waste there is. Yes, it's like a big university. Yes, it's like BigCorp. But no, it's so far beyond those concepts that if that's the only frame of reference you have, you've missed it.<p>I love my country and love paying taxes for it to do useful things. But there simply is no system in place for shutting things down. It just keeps growing. In the private sector the measurement is ""does it do something that folks will pay us for?"" because if it doesn't, folks eventually stop paying, and the company goes away (although it might take decades). In the public sector the metric is ""does it make a politician look bad?""<p>There's a reason Congress delegates all these powers to all these agencies. It's the same reason we have so many ""Tsars"". Nobody is directly accountable. It's all set up so that if there is a problem, some poor schmuck gets hauled before an investigative committee to get the riot act read to them. That way the guys who are supposed to be really responsible -- the Congressmen -- get to play the part of the person looking to fix things. Politics. It's a beautiful thing.<p>So at the end of the day I'm not really sure this is newsworthy. I could tell similar stories involving tens of millions of dollars, and I bet we could come up with a list of hundreds of these things. Anybody remember the FBI case file system? This is just way small peanuts. Perhaps the ""Android app"" part of it is enough to be newsworthy, but in my mind that's a benefit: today there are a lot of people pleading to move away from COBOL systems in some government agency -- and losing. I feel really sorry for those guys.",1322002335

I've grown to see it as a kind of hack genre  it can discuss social issues which readers might find boring or even repellent by creating a world so fantastic that the story's tempting anyway.

Its extremely clean and elegant.<p>However, backbone does not provide an elegant conceptual model for the UI/DOM. Using declarative bindings and JS generated templates is just fine from a coding point of view (I've built a few apps this way), but frankly its not a very powerful mental model - nor is it necessary consistent with the design patterns in backbone that make it shine.<p>I'll tell you the conceptual model of using a view model to control html templates is more empowering.

The alternative path usually requires modifications in the functions and data it's calling and using. But instead of going through the code adding flags everywhere, the idea is to make a source code copy and modify that. It duplicates source code, but keeps the original implementation untouched.<p>I can imagine that it allows more freedom re-working the code.

Our laws give the resources to the people who currently own the land, despite that our countries really hold all land in trust for future generations (see the right of eminent domain). You can be rich off public resources simply because you siphoned them off via a tiny chunk of land you hold while turning a blind eye to any environmental problems you were causing.<p>When the rich actually, in general, contribute a tenth as much or work a tenth as hard (mentally or physically) as the poor, dollar for dollar, what you said may be valid.

Rather, this is a universal phenomenon of software engineering: every change (including bugfixes!) tends to introduce bugs. While bugfix changes usually (though, as many readers will know, not always) reduce the total bugginess of your product, most other changes tend to increase bugginess. So there's an inherent trade-off between on the one hand having a short development cycle, a good (for some definition of good) feature set and quick latency between the design and implementation stages, all of which can be used to make a product more user-friendly; and on the other hand having no bugs, which is also a big contributer to user-friendliness.<p>tl;dr: Ubuntu's customized design and up-to-date packages are not orthogonal to its bugginess; Debian's years-long testing and integration process is not orthogonal to its years-old package selection.",1322000356

I am a sucker for new gadgets.  Every new gadget that I am really excited about gets released, I am literally crawling the web for reviews from the best tech blogger out there.  After reading their reviews, I do determine if I should go to the store and check out the item before making that impulse decision to buy that gadget.  At times, it is hard to get a feel of the gadget as it is sold online and you have to go by on the face value.  After following the process religiously for quiet sometime, I have come to a point where I believe that the blogger, who have been reviewing the gadgets for quite a long time, never look that gadget from a user perspective, but from their own vision of what that gadget should have been.<p>After reading reviews and that too tons of reviews from an expert, you kind of get what the expectation of the blogger was when he was reviewing the gadget. It shows in his reviews. The sad part is that a user who has followed the blogger/reviewer for quite some time gets it and can easily identify where the reviewer is coming from.  Also, today the hype surrounding a product doesnt help. Every new tablet released that makes some noise is an iPad killer. Every new phone that gets released is the mothership phone.<p>Recently, I looked at the Kindle Fire and was blown away by what a device that is selling 66% cheaper than iPad can do.  It is by no means an iPad killer. For me, It doesnt even compete with an iPad in any shape of form. iPad is in its own league and I dont see any tablet that can come close to what it offers from an user experience perspective. The blogger across the globe (Silicon Valley to be precise thats where most noise comes from) started ranting about the device. Most blogger, even Walt Mossberg, was critical on how the page turn on the books was a little slower than the page turn on iPads iBooks.<p>But what Kindle Fire device does is pretty simple. You buy a book reader that does few more tricks then a standard 100$ book reader does. It does videos, music, browser, apps and read books. It has limited apps from amazons app store that you can load for casual gaming and it costs 200$. It has Facebook and Twitter and has a great browser to get around the web. Also amazon has done a smart thing by not really locking down the device.<p>Obviously, a normal user would never go that route to do a one-click root and put an android market on it or Gmail on it. Yet, for 200$ it does satisfy what 80% of iPad owners use their iPad for. For me, it was clear Amazon created this tablet so that a user can buy products from Amazon. They dont care about Android OS not being updated or it not being the latest OS. It really doesnt matter to them as long as they keep that cost to less than $200 and am pretty sure, with kindle Fire 2.0 and 8.9 Kindle in the near horizon, that $200 tablet would get to $140 with living social ads!<p>Coming back to bloggers  I still read their reviews, but I have come to a place, where I can judge with much clarity about a product.",1321999784

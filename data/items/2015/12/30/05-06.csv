10810961,comment,10810760,10810760,0,0,heavenlyhash,,,"One of the biggest problems with the pharmaceutical/insurance hybrid system I experience is the  inability to express choice.<p>My family has an insurance plan in which we pay a set premium cost monthly, and then for some set of health services our insurance promises covers (and thus reduce for us) some of the costs.  I think most Americans are in a similar situation.<p>The insurance company is allowed to reject claims for some services.  In particular, they frequently reject claims for drugs for which there is a cheaper &quot;preferred&quot; alternative.<p>To some extent, this seems reasonable and wise: if there&#x27;s a cheaper, completely substitutable version of the drug, then let&#x27;s use it.<p>The trouble is, things aren&#x27;t nearly so simple.  My grandmother has a strong preference for certain kinds of pain relief medication because some (let&#x27;s call it Drug A)  will knock her out effectively all day, and others (let&#x27;s call it Drug B) let her function wonderfully and pain-free.  However, Drug A is &quot;preferred&quot; to Drug B.  As a result, the insurance refuses to cover it.<p>Every single incentive structure in this system is unproductive:<p>* My grandmother is left expressing her preference by voting with her dollars, out of pocket -- punishing her for expressing a preference.  Because the price gap between Drug A and Drug B is inflated by the effect of the insurance company, this disincentive is so vicious that many people would be unable sustain this at all.  Many consumers are effectively <i>unable to express preference</i> in the market because of the synthetically inflated price gap.<p>* The insurance company feels no pressure whatsoever to cover Drug B, even though the devastating side effects reported by my grandmother are extremely common.  There&#x27;s simply zero incentive for them to behave pro-consumer, <i>or even to bargain the price of Drug B down</i>.<p>* The drug manufactory feels reduced pressure to change the pricing of Drug B, because unless they drop it to <i>below</i> the price of their current high-seller Drug A, the insurance company will powerfully influence the market away from Drug B, despite the fact that it is in almost all cases superior to Drug A and no more difficult to manufacture.<p>By completely failing to align incentives to match good outcomes, we&#x27;ve ended up with a system that&#x27;s pitted against its own progress.  Hackers, can we construct a better market?",1451455058

But the patent system is far, far older than this industry. And I doubt it would go away if you eliminated corruption.<p>>>If the US market didn&#x27;t pay for these drugs, they wouldn&#x27;t still be cheaper in India. They likely wouldn&#x27;t exist at all.<p>>Doubt that much, its quite a strong claim and requires strong evidence. My beef is that we have never even come close to testing this hypothesis<p>I don&#x27;t think this is that controversial a claim. No one is preventing other countries from developing their own drugs, and some do. It&#x27;s not like there is a finite number of chemicals or diseases that need treatment. In what way is the existence of US drug companies preventing anyone else from developing drugs?<p>>But if huge development costs are the reason for these protections to exist, guess what, these costs will continue to remain huge. Its just self perpetuating.<p>They have every incentive to decrease the costs wherever possible. It&#x27;s just fundamentally a very expensive process.

As far as I know raising pigs or chicken evolved a lot in our lifetimes, extensive research was done on how to produce mor meat, there&#x27;s oversight by a public agency and it is consumed by human so there is a decent amount of safety check and oversight.<p>Yet meat is cheap.<p>The more research that went into it, the cheaper it got. Provided meat as a product is more stable and less dangerous than drugs, I still think that it doesn&#x27;t explain why meat would become cheaper while drug price should stay high and pharmatical firms should have extra protection to keep their prices high.<p>We&#x27;re not paying for research, we&#x27;re paying for monopolies.",1451454662

They likely wouldn&#x27;t exist at all.<p>Doubt that much, its quite a strong claim and requires strong evidence. My beef is that we have never even come close to testing this hypothesis<p>One of the oft repeated justification for the absurd levels of IP protection and patent extensions that pharma enjoys is the huge cost of trials. <i>But if huge development costs are the reason for these protections to exist, guess what, these costs will continue to remain huge. Its just self perpetuating.</i><p>Patents are primarily a preemptive measure against a hypothetical scenario. The hypothesis is that unless market pressures are cordoned off, innovation will stop. It is a believable hypothesis but not a quantitative one, and this exactly where we need a quantitative one. How many years exactly does one need to subvert the market so that a satisfactory level of innovation is maintained ? Nobody knows an authoritative answer.<p>In these scenario what we need is a feedback system, and pretty much the only scalable and fair apparatus that we have for such feedback on economic affairs is the <i>market</i>.<p>So rather than subverting the market, market should be explicitly and actively involved to work out this trade-off. How exactly this is to be done needs to be worked out.<p>There could be a futures market on patents on drugs undergoing testing: competitors can promise to buy the patent to the (drug,usecase) pair at a particular price (even if its a dud) and if the owner decides not to sell the owner pay a particular compensation. Such measures will spread the risk. There should be mechanisms for a company to raise money for testing in lieu of rights over the product.<p>The initial period of validity of a patent should be short, like 3~6 years, following which the patent is on the market. Entities can bid to bring the patent to public domain. The owner(s) bids to retain it. Whoever wins gets the balance. Of course the &quot;bring it to public domain&quot; bidders will bid less because profitability is less when its in the public domain, but market decides who gets to own it. If the owner(s) think they can still extract lots of profit from the drug, bid high. We should stop handing out blank checks without a feedback loop, that is just bad design.<p>[p.s. fun to watch the votes go up and down :)]",1451454135

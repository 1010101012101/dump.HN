3496791,comment,3496632,3496738,3,0,drblast,,,"I can attempt that one.  ""Regressive"" is bad only in the sense where it's disproportionately affecting the quality of life of lower-income people.<p>So if I have a flat tax that only affects incomes over a certain income level, and that income level is set high enough so that a reasonable person's food, shelter, and clothing needs are met, it's a lot harder to argue that the tax is unfairly regressive, especially when you consider the flat tax above a certain income level is actually the same  progressive tax we have now but with a single rung on the ladder.<p>The flat tax proposals, being simple and loophole free, make it more difficult (and more financially burdensome) to game, whereas the current system seems to be designed to allow people to gain by paying accountants to find loopholes.  The benefits of a simplified version of the current progressive tax we have seem self-evident.<p>The idea is to reduce or eliminate the incentive to cheat.  Fairness really doesn't factor into it much, although it could be seen as a nice side benefit.  End of argument.<p>Personally, I'd posit that the only truly fair tax is a fixed rate, like ""everyone pays $2000 annually.""  Everyone is entitled to the same protection under the law, and therefore should owe the same amount.  Laws which don't meet the criteria that they apply to all people equally should therefore be stricken.<p>The next closest ""fair"" thing to me is a retail sales tax, provided that everyone is provided a stipend to cover the tax paid on basic living expenses.  That prevents the negative effects of the regressive nature of the tax.",1327247689

Inside that mess was a lot of corruption paid for by lobbiests. You can hide a lot of cronyism in a tax code. I think no matter what you want the tax system to do, as technologists we can ask you to make it do that in a very simple, understandable way. So I support a flat tax, but not because it's ""fair."" I care about structure, I don't care about fair. Make it understandable, and then we can all decide whether it's fair or not. We'll vote people in and out of office depending on whether it's fair or not. Make it complex and we're stuck just voting on tax code depending on how emotionally somebody's speech appeals to us.

The top 1% pays 31.2% [1].<p>The difference between the CBO and Fred Wilson's analysis is corporate income taxes.<p>Suppose Fred Wilson buys 1 share of twitter worth $100. Twitter then makes $10 of profits, which it does not distributed as dividends [2]. This is taxed at the rate of 15-35%, so twitters balance sheet expands by $8.5/share, i.e. Fred Wilson's 1 share is now worth $108.5. He then sells, and pays 15% cap gains, earning back $107.22. To me that looks like a 27.8% tax rate.<p>So yeah, go ahead and tax cap gains at individual income rates.

One is that a flat tax is regressive meaning that it penalizes lower income earners by taxing them at the same rate as higher earners. But I think we are all coming to realize that the current system may be even more regressive since most wealthy people find ways to pay lower tax rates.<p>Let me preface this by saying, I don't necessarily disagree with the ideas presented in this article, however that quoted bit is a very weak argument. Essentially the author is arguing that because the current system is regressive that justifies moving to a flat tax rate. However this does not actually provide an argument for why a flat tax rate is less regressive, rather he only asserts that the current system is not ideal.<p>If you're going to sell people on the idea, you've definitely got to come up with some strong arguments for your proposal and not just arguments against the current implementation.

At the bottom of section 8 is this gem.<p>[...] a court shall presume [...] that the distribution or publication using the Internet of a photograph of [...] a specific person serves no legitimate purpose [...]<p>What does that mean? If you transmit a picture of somebody without them giving the okay first you're probably up to no good?",1327244561

It seems like the battle cry of both parties is ""we're too lazy to come up with our own safe guards, so let's just do the most unnecessary thing that comes to mind. Wait, why are we doing this? Oh right, money."" It's downright pathetic to see those in control having panic attacks in the form of legislation. Next google search: the finer points of being an expatriate.",1327244505

It looks to me like the target of this is drug smugglers and other ""organized criminals"", not some family on vacation in Canada or your linux laptop. It gives law enforcement an easy excuse to dig into the laptops of suspected smugglers and thugs.<p>And that kind of thinking is very, very dangerous. Much worse than SOPA - which, to be frank, was going to be used much like patents are - as a corporate bludgeon in a war for profits (in my opinon- obviously this is speculation). This idea is a direct violation individual freedoms with <i>no greater goal than to exert control over the populace</i>.<p>It's also a signal that the concept of trade restriction is deeply and dangerously flawed.",1327244491

Rather than going to a file sharing network,  I bought a copy on eBay.  I unwittingly got a disk that played perfectly,  but for which all the materials had been printed with an ink jet printer...  A pirate copy.  I would have been happy to pay full price for a legitimate copy,  but they wouldn't take my money.<p>The really sick sector of the industry is multichannel television.  Everyone on the industry is constantly repeating that ""the king is still on the throne,  the pound is still worth a pound"" but the bundling model is slowly killing them the way the music industry began to die slowly in the 1970s.<p>Bundling causes a number of contradictions.<p>One of them is sports programming:  some people are fanatically dedicated to sports (I'll never turn off a game with a TV-B-Gone,  but usually get cheers if I turn off Fox News) other people don't care.  The price of sports programming goes up rapidly because the fanatics will go bezerk if they don't get it,  but that raises the cable bills of people who don't care.  Like health insurance,  bundling tricks people into paying more for a service than they would on their own.  If sports fans were paying for teams or games individually,  they'd pay more and the teams would get less.<p>Another one is quality.  When I visit family and friends with cable I usually find it very hard to be entertained.  Sometimes there's a good movie on,  but I just can't stand the endless reruns of Spongebob Squarepants,  the reality shows,  the ""news"" channels which show nothing but white people talking.<p>The reason you don't see Al Jazeera on U.S. Cable is because it makes the other channels look bad:  when cable is showing  ""news"" shows with tea party idiots talking about how we have to cut taxes AND balance the budget at the same time and reality shows about coupon clippers,  there's a reality show on Al Jazeera about a bunch of people who overthrew an evil dictator in Libya and won their freedom.<p>Even innocuous channels,  like the Weather Channel,  are useless in my mind -- the Weather Channel was innovative in the 80's,  but between the web and NOAA Weather Radio,  who needs it?<p>The system stands because there are people who'll watch whatever is on.  However,  without market discipline,  the industry is in a ""boiled frog"" situation.  They can make stuff that is worse and worse and will find gradually that people lose interest in it.  Although the situation will develop gradually, they'll act quite surprised when reality hits them.",1327244453

I hope the decline of news.yc is not marked by many front page posts concerning news.yc itself.<p>I don't visit news.yc because I'm interested in news.yc - I'm interested, oddly enough, in Hacker news (with a business bent). <p>Then again, I fear that may have already happened - a post on news.yc on an article about 'hackers', that criticized the Morris worm was modded into oblivion for no other reason than Robert Morris later went on to found yc - though Robert himself has publicly expressed remorse for releasing said worm. <p>It seems news.yc is suffering from the cult of personality.<p>",1196648832

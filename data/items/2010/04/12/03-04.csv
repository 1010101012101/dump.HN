As a national (but ""unofficial"") policy, it's certainly helped them ""bring hundreds of millions out of poverty"" over the last 30 years, but I'm not sure if it'll help them much in the future 30 years.<p>I remember letting a Chinese teacher of English observe one of my classes. (I'm a Westerner, teaching English in China.) When I taught the lesson, I had a selection of possible activities, sense the students' moods, and choose some of them accordingly. But a few weeks later, I went into an empty classroom just as she was walking out, and on the blackboard was what had been there when I had taught the lesson, word for word, in the exact same positions.<p>So I think the entrenched Chinese habit of copying everything will prevent them having the creativity needed to succeed as a nation in the next 30 years.",1271044715

(I might add that the record label bogeyman is clearly in no danger of disappearing from the collective consciousness of Hacker News.)<p>Here's the thing: Apple is a platform company, and in essence, it's been in the business of screwing those that are hostage to its platform at least since its renaissance. Apple doesn't want those in its ecosystem to make much money, because it wants you to give <i>it</i> your money.<p>That's why it said ""Rip. Mix. Burn."" with respect to musicians' work back in 2001 (to much cheering and adulation from developers): they were quite happy for you to get all your music for free (at the expense of the artists and labels), and instead allocate your disposable income to their hardware devices. When they opened iTunes, they added insult to injury by not allowing musicians to control how their music gets packaged and priced. I don't remember anyone complaining about the Apple's hard-driving tactics then.<p>And lo, now they're treating third-party developers with the same contempt they previously reserved for musicians -- and suddenly the Hacker Community is up in arms. Plus ca change...<p>> Maybe all of us 'rockstar' developers should be careful what we wish for.<p>It's what you wished for ten years ago that put you in the quandary you now find yourselves in.

Likewise, the 3-part for loop of Java et al does not hide the fact that it's the same variable every time through the loop.<p>The Java for-each loop, on the other hand, is more ambiguous.

It's a quick way of getting an approximate picture of a person.  If somebody introduces you to Rick as ""a former Republican senator from South Dakota"" your mind is already filling in lots of blanks about Rick with categories like ""male"", ""senator"", ""Republican"" and ""South Dakotan"".  Our mind gives us a head-start in knowing about Rick.  The problem comes when we don't allow ourselves to revise this rough-draft picture of Rick.  Perhaps we think all Republicans are like X, so Rick is like X.  Therefore, we don't bother looking for information about whether Rick is like X, because we already <i>know</i>.  Labels can get in the way of actually knowing somebody.<p>2. A label often carries the implicit assumption that the aspects of the person in question are immutable.

To pay off that debt, you need to spend less (including the interest on the money you owe) than you get paid, so you can give the surplus to the credit card company, thereby reducing the amount you owe them. If you spend <i>more</i> than you get paid, your credit card debt goes up (i.e. you&#x27;re running a budget deficit).<p>In other words, the budget deficit must be eliminated (i.e. turned into a budget surplus) before the government can begin to reduce the national debt.<p>In 2008, the UK government spent ~£150bn more than it earnt, so the national debt grew by that amount. Last year, it spent about £90bn more than it earnt, so the national debt is still rising. The good news is that the deficit is falling. The government aims to eliminate it by 2020, at which point they will be in a position to start reducing the size of the national debt.",1435575255

2056703,comment,2050797,2054713,0,0,berntb,,,"I got some time and finished this, posting after minimal rereading...<p>I was more interested in two other statements -- I now <i>really</i> think Chomsky is a propagandist.<p>A) 5:45, where he explained why he criticizes Israel more than all the other places which are much worse. ""He can influence more"", because he is American.<p>That is just not true. It doesn't explain his lack of attention on Sudan, which lacked attention from the international community, when murder/rape by the millions were taking place. If someone with Chomsky's weight had started to make speeches, it would have added needed attention. And probably saved, at a minimum, thousands of lives.<p>(That Chomsky statement doesn't help explain the total fixation on Israel by all the other left wingers with similar opinions in e.g. Western Europe... Where outright demonization of Israel is more or less standard.)<p>B) At one minute, Chomsky explains that there is no need to consider the existential threat, because Israel ignored a peace offer from Egypt in 1971... (Despite that Israel has peace with Egypt since a few decades, anyway!)<p>Whatever, with that an easy standard on blaming the victims, you can motivate <i>anything</i> -- based on what a government did a few generations ago, in a very different world!<p>(According to the Israeli side, Sadat gave other signals to PLO about supporting them and not really going for peace. I have no idea if that is true or not, neither has Chomsky.)<p>Democracies tend to go insane over terrorism and throw out human rights (GB, USA, Germany, Israel, etc) -- with Israel we talk about an existential threat…<p>Israel is the only present democracy with that, but look at different internment camps for civilians in the second world war (including Sweden, which threw lots of communists in jail because they took order from Moscow -- and Sweden wasn't even in the war!).<p>I am not defending putting people in camps -- I'm just noting that in a lot less threatening situation, most everyone was worse -- including my native Sweden.<p>In conclusion, I have a considered opionion now: Chomsky writes propaganda.",1293836042

Since the central square is white, the bishop has put the food in the middle.\nThe white knight can only make knight moves - from its starting point, it can only move edge-corner, edge-corner, edge-corner, edge-corner before coming back to its starting point. The knight can never land in the middle square at all, so it will eventually starve.\nThe knight can, however, move onto the black squares: in fact, it <i>has</i> to land on a black square every other move.\nThe bishop's claim that he was ""that close"" to capturing the knight is also exaggerated - it can be shown how, barring an error, the pieces could move about that board forever in an endless loop.",1293836026

Anything beyond drill-down UX exercises like eliminating information clutter in visual design seems to immediately break down. Assuming we're talking about something more general than eliminating the widgets from our blog sidebars... What ARE we talking about? I guess I could imagine it going one step higher, into a campaign to stop ourselves from reading blogs and Hacker News when we should be working, ie., the logical evolution of our collective obsession with GTD and similar systems from a couple years ago: a slightly doctrinaire insistence on techniques for productivity. Which is great, especially if you're a 'knowledge worker' (I'm not).<p>But I still lose the plot when we start actually using the word big-M 'Minimalism', or when we start invoking Zen. Zen is many things: spiritual practice, proto-psycho-exploration, a system of psychology, a system of ethics and epistemology—but I'm not sure it has anything to do with anything that the leading Neo-Minimalists have deemed worthy of inclusion into their morning workflows. Keeping a blog, for one, is not a very Zen thing to do. In fact, the practice of Zen is in part anathema to nearly every technique of thought that a knowledge worker employs in his job. It's a refutation of the construction of narrative, of pattern-recognition, of comprehension, and finally of cognition. It's an attempt to obliterate our own understandings of the world, to destroy our conceptions of objects, uses, signs, signifiers, others and ourselves, to be replaced with pure being and hopefully compassion. And it's DEFINITELY at odds with the all-inclusive rapid-fire content-association that is at the heart of tumblr culture. But I don't see how the practice of Zen has anything to do with the way one orders one's workspace, if one never considers what one is doing with one's mind, or one's content. I don't see what possible use, that is, it would be to invoke Zen and minimalism when describing how we choose our text editors if we allow what we're writing to remain entirely unconsidered.<p>Which is not to say that I think these Neo-Minimalists are a sort of religious hypocrite for not practicing Zen in all walks of life. The people whose blogs I see reflecting the practices of Neo-Minimalism seem like interesting, intelligent people, writing about the same sort of thing we have been writing for years: technology, culture, memes, funny videos, food, beer. I just don't understand what they could possibly think all the fuss is about in any realm beyond what window manager they've decided to use.<p>I've heard a couple people talk about getting rid of all the things they don't use, which seems nice, too. But it's a housekeeping exercise. You can't possibly expect me to believe that only having five shirts in your closet will make you a different person, or even a different worker. What is the _there_ here? I haven't heard anyone discuss eating the same thing every day. Or listening to the same music. Or paring down their vocabulary. What does one do? What is there besides being able to create uninterrupted expanses of negative space (which I concede are very nice) and then appreciating their aesthetics?",1293833417

He spent summers at law firms but never practiced and I don't believe that he's licensed to practice.  He went to work in real estate but found his passion in startups.  I believe he tried to start his own startup -- and learned a little Ruby in the process -- but the startup failed.  He did some angel investing (he's independently wealthy as a Tisch and likely from his previous work history at law firms and in real estate), and was an early investor in Boxee.  (Avner Rosen's talk at Techstars for a Day suggested that Dave was an early investor when they were struggling to raise money for their physical box concept, i.e., Dave was there before Boxee was cool.)  He's otherwise made a few other good investments.<p>He met David Cohen at some event, approached him, and asked, ""How about NYC?""  Cohen as I recall said that he got that question all the time when Techstars was popping off, but Tisch was one of the few people that followed up on that and kept in touch.  When Cohen thought seriously about doing NYC, it was Dave Tisch who he worked with so Dave was the logical choice to run the thing.<p>That said, Dave doesn't have the track record of someone like Brad Feld, but he's very enthusiastic, he's working very hard, and he's very bright.  It seemed clear to me from Techstars for a Day NYC that Dave is running NYC -- he is the guy.",1293833349

Try to play games on the same team. Eat meals together. Talk together. Get ready in the mornings together. Watch movies together. Do as much as you possibly can - together. If you think about the way we use the word 'marry' in other concepts (i.e. the perfect marriage of X and Y), it talks about a blending of two things that becomes a new, third thing. So, marriage isn't just two people living in the same place. It's two people becoming something new together. One of the best examples I've seen of this idea is the second chapter of the book <i>A Severe Mercy</i>. The togetherness the author writes about is ridiculously complete.<p>- The wedding, as much work as it takes to put together, is just the starting line. Don't make the mistake of thinking that you've won your wife and can move onto another project. It's an incredibly easy mistake to make, and a terribly dangerous one. Marriage, especially because of my first point, is hard work. It's breath-taking and awe-inspiring, but it's also hard work. I Love it!<p>Congratulations!",1293832969

But I was kicked out of college indirectly due to my addiction to Counter Strike.<p>I dunno if the same is true for WoW but one of the reasons I believe Counter Strike is so addictive is the time you have to wait after you get killed, before the next round starts.<p>I believe this is due to the fact that variable reinforcement schedules are more resistant to extinction:<p>""Skinner also looked at variable schedules.  Variable ratio means you change the “x” each time -- first it takes 3 presses to get a goodie, then 10, then 1, then 7 and so on.  Variable interval means you keep changing the time period -- first 20 seconds, then 5, then 35, then 10 and so on.<p>In both cases, it keeps the rats on their rat toes.  With the variable interval schedule, they no longer “pace” themselves, because they can no longer establish a “rhythm” between behavior and reward.  Most importantly, these schedules are very resistant to extinction.  It makes sense, if you think about it.  If you haven’t gotten a reinforcer for a while, well, it could just be that you are at a particularly “bad” ratio or interval!  Just one more bar press, maybe this’ll be the one!""<p>Counter Strike is a variable interval schedule.  Once you die you have to wait an unknown amount of time before you can play again.  This makes counter strike playing behavior more resistant to extinction and I believe one of the big reasons why people get so addicted to it.  If you respawned the second you died in Counter Strike (as you do in deathmatch) I'm fairly positive there would be a much fewer number of people addicted to the game.\nI believe this is quite a big factor in addiction.  I haven't heard of anyone addicted to any FPS deathmatch multiplayer game.  I'm sure there are some, but much less so than games like counter strike where you have to wait.",1293832918

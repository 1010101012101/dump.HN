362909,comment,362657,362657,0,0,luckystrike,,,"This brought back some good memories for me. (I mean the post only). My final year project at engineering was (an attempt) to build an EEG machine (design). I was not much of a hardware guy, and did it as a last chance (at least for a while) to learn a bit more. The other option in my mind was to may write a RTOS or something but i thought that can happen any time later as well.<p>Joerg Hansmann (the leading hacker behind this hardware design) was simply awesome and very helpful with sharing his knowledge about the circuit design. (This was late 2001). It was actually the first time i realized the true worth of open source communities, and their role in sharing of knowledge and information.<p>Thanks geius for posting this, i ought to contribute back to this community for sure, in one way or the other.",1226570212

Keep the first N bytes of each file in a local cache, and when the user starts to read a file, you're pre-buffered. Note that this is just a cache; the whole file is still reliably stored at the remote site.<p>Users probably use the same small subset of files over and over again, too, so you don't even need to keep the head of <i>all</i> the files to eliminate most latency effects.",1226570082

I was told that switching to semesters was an attempt to deal with the fast pace we always felt under the quarter system.<p>It really was a great education and the pains we experienced did bond the students in natural support groups.  I have several life long friends from that journey.  Other than going to UGA and having more access to women, I wouldn't have done it any other way ;).",1226568760

362895,comment,362421,362501,0,0,jd,,,"Nope, lisp without garbage collection isn't feasible. Tried it - didn't work out. Let's start with an ordinary lisp implementation, and replace garbage collection with stacklocal and manual allocation. Then using a couple of examples I'll show that you end up with a monstrosity.<p>You can do a lot with stack-local allocation, but not everything. I think it's fair to say that a Lisp without closures is a useless Lisp.<p>A clever compiler can optimize something like<p><pre><code>    (print (reduce (list 1 2 3 4) (lambda (x y) (+ y x))))\n</code></pre>\nsuch that it works without any garbage collection. The list you create is a local variable, the lambda function is a pure function without state (no closure necessary) and reduce is also a pure function.<p>You might think that if you can do this, you can express almost everything without garbage collection. Unfortunately, not really.<p>Suppose you have `revere-list` function. E.g.<p><pre><code>    (reverse-list (list 1 2 3 4)) # '(4 3 2 1)\n</code></pre>\nWe previously assumed that the list was a local variable, created as a function argument. Now reverse-list must return a copy of the list, as the original list ceases to exist when the function returns. That's a problem, because it means you have to make deep-copies of every object on function calls. No big deal, you say: a lot of languages call-by-value. Well, yes, but it _is_ a big deal. Because it means you have to introduce & and * so you can describe when you want a by-copy and by-reference assignment.<p>So you get a lisp with pointers. A lot of fun, but not all that practical.<p><pre><code>   (= *(elt my-list 3) (+ *(elt my-list 3) 1))\n</code></pre>\nYes, it's exactly what you think it is. 'elt now returns a reference to a list element, that you have to dereference before assignment. Ugly, but it works right?<p>Oh no. It gets worse. What if you create a function that returns a reference to a function argument (stack-local!)? Segfault.<p>A lisp with pointers that can segfault at any point? That's it. I'm going back to C.<p>I've skipped a lot of steps here (I could go on for hours), so you have to read really carefully to see how every problem is a logical consequence of each assumption. Sorry for that...<p>I've been trying to find the perfect balance between stack-allocation (RAII) and garbage collection, and it's a lot tougher than it seems.",1226568306

362893,comment,361294,362731,0,0,Elepsis,,,"I should note that things at Georgia Tech today are not quite so dire as jhancock describes them being. Yes, classes are still quite hard and you still have to take a lot of painful ones to get through (often simultaneously, especially if you want to pursue other opportunities like research, internships and co-op).<p>But in my 5+ years at GT I've never felt a lack of support made available to me. TAs, professors, tutors (in some cases) and other resources have always been pretty readily available. Most of all, the ""fight the shaft"" perspective means students are generally willing to help eachother out and work together.<p>Far fewer classes are graded on a bell curve, too, though the average GPA at Tech remains around a 2.7 or 2.8 and it really is uncommon for people in the harder majors to graduate with a 4.0.<p>That's not to say that the Institute can't use more resources to do a better job than it is currently doing. But for better or worse, GT is no longer the throw you in the pool and see if you manage to swim school it once was.",1226567721

362888,comment,359093,360429,0,0,bd,,,"It's a small calculator-like device, more or less the size of the credit card.<p>Their reasoning for why it's supposed to be better than SMS:<p>a) you are not dependent on a third party (mobile phone operator), so that you couldn't access your account when there is no coverage, or your battery is dead, etc;<p>b) with SMS you get authorization once per session, with card reader each transaction gets unique authorization (you have to enter a transaction details twice - online and in the reader). So even if somebody ""listens in"" to your traffic, they would be just able to reply your actions exactly, not use your credentials to do their actions.<p>This layer of protection also exists for SMS solution, but it's limited as they use printed grid of codes for  additional authorization of transactions. So that in principle if somebody hijacks your traffic for a long enough time, they would be able to reconstruct your static grid of codes. Or they could phish you to give your codes (it did happen, there is a big red warning on their homepage).",1226567119

2901493,comment,2899692,2901325,5,0,nostrademons,,,"From my conversations with I-banker friends, it sounds like the long hours in I-banking are externally imposed.  When a client is facing an imminent acquisition deal, it's very important that they get all their accounting straightened out, all their valuations nailed down while the acquirer is still interested.  A delay usually means the deal falls through.<p>So when companies come to an I-banking firm, they're usually like ""I need all your best people on this, stat.""  And because there're millions of dollars at stake, the I-banking firm will happily comply.<p>So I-bankers definitely fall into the ""working late because of <i>somebody else's</i> incompetence"" camp.  In this case, it's customers.  There're various things that startups could do that would make I-banker's jobs a lot easier: keep good accounting records, make sure they're completely covered legally, have solid revenue streams, don't get all buddy-buddy with potential acquirers.  But startups that do all this rarely need an I-banker to close the deal; they just negotiate directly with a potential acquirer, have the lawyers draw up a deal, and sign it.<p>Basically, the I-banking business model is trading other people's stupidity for cash.  It's the same thing with management consultants, and divorce attorneys, and litigators, all also professions that can make a lot of money but have shitty quality of life.",1313707948

(And not all extensions need to modify pages, even Chrome ones.)<p>I didn't say you shouldn't install extensions that require content privileges (indeed I would highly recommend that you install at least one [1] [2]); just that you should do so with care, and decide whether you trust their authors, because of the broad access they have.

UTF-8 is a better ""default choice"", but the algorithms for both are very hard to get right.  Given an idealized Unicode string object, it's still hard to do things like count the number of glyphs required to display the text in font foo, or convert all characters to ""lowercase"", or sort a list of names in ""alphebetical"" order.  But the problem is not Unicode or UTF-16 or UTF-8, the problem is defining what a correct computer program is, and ultimately, that's the job for the programmer, not the string encoding algorithm.<p>Think of UTF-8 and UTF-16 as being like in-memory compression for Unicode strings.  You can't take a gzip file, count the number of bytes, and multiply by some factor to get the true length of the string.  But, this complexity is often worth the space savings, so that's why these encodings exist.<p>The problem that people have is twofold: one, the average programmer doesn't realize that characters and character encodings are two different things.  The second is, they don't realize that a Unicode string is a data structure that does one thing and only one thing: maintain a sequence of Unicode codepoints in memory.<p>A Unicode string is not ""text"" in some language; it's some characters for a computer.  To choose the right font or sort things correctly, you need additional information sent out-of-band.  There is no way to do it right given only the Unicode string itself.  People are reluctant to send out-of-bad data and so other people assume Unicode is hard.  It's not.  The problem is that Unicode is not text.",1313706557

2901373,comment,2898790,2901024,1,0,St-Clock,,,"""What you fail to realize"" <- ?<p>First, I believe there is a cultural difference between Canada and the US. In Canada, a Master's degree is typically not a professional degree and you usually cannot buy a M.Sc. Typically, half of the credits come from courses and the other half (often even more) comes from your thesis. I don't know about the situation in the UK, the author's country of origin.<p>Second, I TAed and taught programming, algorithms, and software architecture courses for undergrads, Master's and Ph.D. students so I'm well aware of the advantages and limitations of higher education. I saw students in an advanced architecture course who did not know what a thread was or who had never written a single SQL query. Well, they learned it in my course.<p>The graduate students that I described aren't rare. At least 75% of the Master's and Ph.D. students in the SE lab and PL lab at my university match that description. Maybe they would have a hard time building a web application in a day, but I think they have demonstrated that they can learn pretty complicated things and that they will learn how to solve your particular technical problems.<p>I felt the article was really about ""degree snobbery"", meaning that the author promoted snubbing people with degrees. I understand the frustration of people without degree who need to prove every time that they don't need one. But I don't believe that having a systematic negative bias on candidates with a degree is wise either. Honestly, does it make sense as the author says that someone with a bachelor in C.S. don't know how to implement a binary search (see [1] for a possible explanation)?<p>Regarding the vocational training that needs to be removed from higher education, I believe a compromise is needed. I agree that you cannot efficiently learn development process and all the latest languages and frameworks at school. But you need to learn some good programming skills and software engineering practices, otherwise, it is a lot harder to understand and play with more complex concepts and it is also more difficult to bring a significant contribution if you do a Master or Ph.D. later.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.skorks.com/2010/10/99-out-of-100-programmers-cant-program-i-call-bullshit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skorks.com/2010/10/99-out-of-100-programmers-cant...</a>",1313705669

Progress bars <i>are</i> inaccurate, in the sense that they're simply not a good way to convey accurate information about task completion to a human user. Them's just facts.<p>But that's not <i>bad</i>. I said it was a <i>nice</i> scam. Sometimes it's good to be fooled. Putting a minigame during the load screen doesn't make the real game load any faster, but it makes the time seem to pass faster, and that's <i>nice</i>. Doesn't make it not fooling.<p>As for streaming video, as I said already, a video buffer indicator is tied to a UI element in the timeline. It tells me where I can scrub to in the timeline and have it play video immediately without buffering. That's useful.<p>It's <i>not</i> useful as a progress indicator, for telling me how much longer I need to wait to watch the video-- because my computer is way, way better at doing that math than I am. I would much rather have a simple indicator that tells me, given my current download speed, whether I will have to wait for buffering before it finishes playing, and if so, how long I have to wait until that is not the case. In fairness, you can get a decent idea of that based on whether or not the buffer indicator is advancing away from the playhead, which is another detail that distinguishes a streaming buffer from other sorts of progress indicators.",1313705644

If you're doing x = x +2 in XSL you're doing it wrong and that's why it's so awkward.
XSL is very strong in that one domain only - declaratively transforming XML.
It's actually much easier to maintain rules than any other language I tried for this particular purpose.
I just hope people won't try to use it too much - it has it's own niche and because XML is everywhere now it's a fairly big niche, but it's best used sparingly and in combination with other technologies.",1273746511

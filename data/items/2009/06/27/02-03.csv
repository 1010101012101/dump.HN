676536,story,,,4,4,shiny,"Ask HN: Performance hit for jQuery Download?",,"I'm using JQuery for the first time on a new site.  I love it, but I had some worries.<p>I really want my site to be snappy, but it seems that downloading JQuery, even when minified, can cause a decent performance hit.<p>Is this worry justified?  If so, is there anything I can do?  Can something like GWT do the same basic stuff that JQuery does (and thus reap the performance benefits from less code to DL)?<p>Also, if this is a problem, and since I see a lot of sites using jQuery these days, why can't the browsers bundle the framework in their browser so the user doesn't have to download it each HTTP hit (of course, using the bundled framework would be optional)?<p>Thank you.",1246071201

676533,comment,675622,675622,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"The only reason JSON script injection is a problem is because nitwits don't use a library that parses the JSON code first to verify that it's 100% pure JSON. Crocker's JSON library fully verifies pure JSON-ness before eval-ing the string (which is technically an unnecessary step).<p>Furthermore, why should we worry about changing JSON? It's not amazingly difficult to construct a parser for some custom document format like this, after all. I use a subset of Ruby as a data interchange format because of the ability to use arbitrary values as hash keys, and the ability to have symbols that are distinct from strings. The parser for it is maybe 80 lines at most, and doesn't rely on Ruby internals to handle it. Because Ruby also doesn't have a Date/Time literal notation, I have a way of denoting that (datetime(...)) which the parser also handles.<p>There's no reason people should be talking about this, it's a non-issue. It's never too late to change JSON, or to even do something completely different that better suits your needs. Just write the parser for it!<p>And if the issue is ""OMG interoperability! :("", it's not terribly diffuclt to provide your developers with the JavaScript lib to handle the parsing.",1246070791

676521,comment,676322,676492,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Several reasons.  First, that's only useful for a single browser (or if the OS can manage the cert, a single computer or maybe domain account).  Using certs, there's no easy way to login from your friend's house, or from the internet cafe.<p>Second, it would have to be supported at the browser level well enough to be at least as easy as password usage, which is hard, since password usage is super-easy, as long as you choose a weak one (and people avoid sites that enforce good passwords, if they can).  I'm using Safari, and I can't find anything about client-side certificates in the prefs.  I know IE and Firefox support them fairly well, as I've used them for intranet sites in the past, but I don't think it's easy.  Basically, the first time a site demanded a cert, the browser would have to walk someone through generating one, and it's hard to see how that could be made easy enough for people to sit through it.<p>Third, any cert that has a password to unlock is going to be at least as difficult for the user as just using a password, and any cert which <i>doesn't</i> require a password will be vulnerable to being stolen by trojans, etc.<p>You can get all the good things about using a cert by just making your site SSL-only and using a cookie, and this also avoids some of the bad things (inconvenience), but not all (vulnerability to trojans).",1246070080

The human body is one of the most complex systems on the planet suggesting we ""Eat food, real food not to much mostly plants."" is not particularly useful information.  Nutritionist's have known for a long time that a pure corn diet is bad for you.  What he is really attacking is the public perception of nutrition information which is far from the cutting edge of science.  When NASA looks at nutrition they go far beyond the sound bite science and do a good job of supporting people in peek physical condition.<p>The real problem is just eating one type of cheep food, with a long shelf life, that's easy to prepare, is bad for you in excess.

Can you provide an example?<p>Because there are a million things you can do in objective c with the ui that are basically impossible to do with html5, and many many ui elements you can configure 100x faster in obj-c(they also run 100x faster).  Hell even having a reasonable 2 column lay out is surprisingly difficult in html/css.<p>With obj c/native if you are unhappy with some functionality of the ui you can very easily break into open gl and do pretty much anything you can imagine if you have the talent.<p>As far as I can tell the only real advantages of using html5 is that you can hit many platforms poorly with one code base, and that maybe you don't really know how to program or understand object oriented programming.<p>I would not say speed of making a ui is a plus for html unless you are trying to hit a bunch of platforms poorly or do not know the native languages well.",1348505945

The moment Apple jumped the shark was when they banned apps not originally written in C/ObjC from the app store.  In that moment they made it virtually impossible to be a geek with any credibility and not be at least a little embarrassed to be an Apple fan.  They reversed their decision but it was too late - geeks flooded into Android and the Android market increased its app count by about 400% in the ensuing months.  Ever since then I've noticed that my geek friends who carry iPhones have been defensive about it - they say things to rationalize why they aren't carrying a real geek phone.",1348505905

Instead, we are going to get rid of the GIL by having a new VM for running mypy code. The VM will be based on the Alore VM, but it will use compiled native code from the start (the Alore VM uses a bytecode interpeter). It will use a garbage collector instead of reference counting (CPython primarily uses reference counting), and it will also support a modified C Python extension API that will support proper multithreading without a GIL.<p>The CPython VM will still be used to run Python code and modules, and it will still be limited to running a single thread at a time (most of the time). Objects passed between the VMs will have to be copied or accessed using proxy objects, so there will be some performance overhead compared to native mypy modules. We plan to port commonly used, performance-sensitive Python modules to mypy and the modified C API to minimize performance bottlenecks.",1348505870

While 'regular' plans are comparable to US plans, the budget operators are incredibly cheap.<p>It's been a similar situation in Australia.  We had incredibly high costs, and for many years the value of our internet went BACKWARDS - as the price went up, our data was also heavily restricted.  However that trend finally reversed and it's much better value now.  When I left Australia I had a 200gb 100mbit internet plan with a home line for $78 a month (and that included a cable modem).<p>I have to say I was pretty shocked at how poor the choice and value is in the US after moving here, particularly in Silicon Valley.  Fast internet (> 30mbit) is incredibly unaffordable, and there is huge pressure to have to bundle with cable TV (which I don't want or need).<p>And what's up with the phone plans here?! The only reason I'm not absolutely screaming about it is I'm on a shared plan with my wife - if I were trying to get a phone just for myself the costs would be insane.<p>The biggest kicker is trying to find a good prepaid with data SIM - in Australia you can walk into any 7-11 and buy a SIM card for $2 and then get on a $2/day unlimited phone/data prepaid plan (i.e. you just charge up and then every day you use it another $2 is taken off your tab).  There is NOTHING like that here.<p>I'm not sure if it's because of a lack of competition or what - in Australia all networks are now (roughly) compatible with each other, so if you buy a phone on one network it'll work on another.  Then you have many many resellers who buy the network access wholesale from the big providers and then resell it.  Same for the internet market.

However, it's not been so good for things at the top of the stack, like applications. Design by committee is no design at all.<p>If Apple's done anything right, it's brought design to the forefront of a lot of people's thought as a driving force for innovation (and to a lesser extent, Ruby, with its focus on programmer happiness, which is language design)<p>But even then, most open source software focuses on getting it to work first, and figures that someone else will come along to help later. The most usable projects are the ones that decide from the beginning to focus on usability.<p>In addition, some people probably feel, ""Hey, I'm giving this away for free already, and you're complaining about usability? You go fix it.""<p>And are there open source designs? Twitter bootstrap is the only one I'm aware of.

Though for what I was on about it would still be a case of working out the hash for a smaller part than the sum of the entire data, but as I have thought though.  If you stripe the data blocks across the sum of the data then the ability to modify a small part of the data would still result in you taking just as long to work out the hash for the entire sum of data.  It is when blocking is done in contiguous blocks (100 byte data block 1 is bytes 1-10, block 2 is 11-20 etc) then is were you have the issue I describe and yes what you say about hash feedback is correct in that for any block it will add a extra time factor but it will still be less than the entire lot of data and if you can erhash 10 bytes instead of the entire 100 bytes it can only be quicker.  But if those blocks are stippped then you would get the best of both worlds and have the ability to parallise your hashing without fear of being any weaker by design, but thats only if you stripe the data blocks you paralise and not if you use contiguise blocks.

I live in what was designated as a ""single family"" residential area in San Francisco.  It is a little expensive, and many people are starting to convert the garages into (probably illegal) in-laws.  Paving over the front lawn to make a parking spot for the new tenant is also a common occurrence.  Not surprisingly, families with children are having trouble competing on price with people who 1) don't have the burden of children, and 2) vastly increase their income by having tenants in what is now essentially a downstairs flat.  I do think it is reasonable for neighborhoods to seek regulations against this kind of conversion - that doesn't mean I necessarily support it in all forms, but I don't necessarily see it as a vile law that should simply be disregarded as an act of civil disobedience.<p>I suspect that airbnb is running afoul of laws that limit short-term rentals because neighborhoods want to remain ""residential"", that is, they don't want to become a neighborhood of vacationers.  This issue comes up most in neighborhoods that are attractive to vacationers but still have a large local population (the left bank of paris, an arts district in santa fe, etc).  It typically isn't an issue in a country club in palm springs (in fact, some of these communities have a rule <i>against</i> long term residents!)<p>In short, I agree with you that cartels and regulatory capture can get to the point where civil disobedience is warranted, but I'm immediately skeptical of arguments that regulations designed to limit short term rentals fall under this category.",1348504393

I get why diego was flabbergasted by the default, and I also hear legitimate claims that the documentation should have been read. But what I want to know is: Why are MongoDB advocates in such a bad mood?<p>It's legit to criticize a language or a database. However, it seems to me that when MongoDB gets involved, the tone is far more aggressive and defensive. What's up with that? It's just software, bits and config files. It's not like someone called your mom a harlot.<p>Here's what I think. New developers, for a long time, have come into the industry and become overwhelmed with everything they need to learn. Let's take typical database servers. Writing a SELECT is easy enough, but to truly be an expert you have to learn about data writing operations, indexing, execution plans, triggers, replication, sharding, GRANTs, etc. As it's a mature technology, you start out barely an apprentice, with all these experienced professionals around you.<p>In recent years, software development has really been turned on its head. We're not building apps using the same stack we've used for a long time: OO + RDBMS + view layer + physical hardware. The younger the technology, the better, it seems. In theory, a 3 year developer and a 20 year developer are now pretty equal when we're talking about a technology that's been around 2-3 years. That wouldn't be true if we were dealing with say, OO design patterns. (Even when new languages come along, you still get to keep your experience in the core competencies.)<p>Attacks on these new technologies are perceived as an assault on this new world order, and those who have walked into being one of the ""newb elite"" respond emotionally to what they see as a battle for the return to the old guard.

Just create a Gate object or whatever and drop it on the stack before you call the wait_for... thing.  An exception thrown out of that scope will clean up the Gate object for you and close it.

And further: the fact that D <i>has</i> syntax that makes this operation clean doesn't mean that it will be used.  That first example can be written in any language, and often is.

Nowhere in the documentation does it mention that it will silently discard your data.  What will happen with the 64-bit version if you run out of disk space, more silently discarded data?<p>I know a lot of you may have cut your teeth on MySQL which, in its default configuration, will happily truncate your strings if they are bigger than a column.  Guess what?  Anyone serious about databases does not consider MySQL to be a proper database with those defaults.  And with this, neither is MongoDB, though it may have its uses if you don't need to be absolutely certain that your data is stored.<p>EDIT: Thanks for pointing out getLastError.  My point still stands, since guaranteed persistence is optional rather than the default.  In fact, reading more of the docs points out that some drivers can call getLastError by default to ensure persistence.  That means that MongoDB + Driver X can be considered a database, but not MongoDB on its own.<p>I'm just struggling to imagine being willing to lose some amount of data purely for the sake of performance, so philosophically it's not a database unless you force it to be.  Much like MySQL.<p>EDIT2: Not trying to be snarky here, but I would love to hear about datasets people have where missing random data would not be an issue.  I'm serious, just want to know what the use case is that MongoDB's default behaviour was designed for.<p>EDIT3: (Seriously) I'm sure MongoDB works splendidly when you setup your driver to ensure that a certain numbers of servers will confirm receipt of the data (if your driver supports such an option), nowhere am I disputing that.  But that number really should have a lower bound of 1, enforced by MongoDB itself.  And to the guy who called me stupid: you are what's wrong with HN.",1348504081

The fallacy of the college argument, and yours, is that structured learning has benefit in information gained over time at the start which is unmatched by unstructured learning.<p>Consider the time spent in an accelerator at those 'useless' mentoring meetings, they are with folks who have done a lot of different things, seen what is successful and what isn't, and more importantly know what traction 'feels' like when its happening. That lets one quickly learn the right stuff without having to waste time chasing ideas which aren't really having an impact.<p>I noticed that you backed off your argument a bit here: ""I hear accelerator programs can slow you down in certain scenarios."" If you're being honest with yourself then you can understand that ""certain scenarios"" is not ""all scenarios"" and by that reasoning your thesis fails. By that reasoning you would have to change your thesis ""most likely"" to maybe ""possible"".<p>If you want to reason about what makes a consumer app either a good fit or a bad fit for an accelerator that would be good to talk about. What sort of problems are ill suited to an accelerator environment and why? (and trust me, meeting frequency is not a good metric) There are a lot of accelerators out there [1], why not go through their funded projects and rank them consumer/non-consumer (you will need to define consumer app fairly precisely I suspect) and then bring some reasoning to the table that lets folks know how you arrived at the conclusion you did and why you believe it.

Some people view this as the future, but I view it as a site built by an entry-level developer that will be unusable by most of its clients. If you ever want some free comment karma on Reddit find any submission, complain about the file size of the site and watch the upvotes from conflicted developers fly.<p>However, these things have context.<p>If this website were for a typical business then yes, you'll have ""bugs"" flying in from everywhere from the client. They'll not be able to view it on IE7 because that's the only browser their IT department will allow, their users will also be running this site on an ancient computer that cannot handle a dozen jQuery plugins running on a single page and they'll start making demands that you, the developer, will find unreasonable because ""that's not how HTML5 works!"".<p>However, if you're creating a new business with a set market of people with newish machines running modern browsers then you can afford to use ""new"" technology and to sacrifice your precious page size for some creativity. For some markets it is a good thing if a site will heavily utilise JavaScript. For some web applications, it's almost necessary to rely on JS.<p>Regardless, a good developer will be able to get a modern site working well in legacy browsers even if the user is on IE6. I'm no senior-level developer, nor am I solely a front-end developer, but I can at least do that much on a large-scale client site without any trouble. If I can do it then I fail to see how so many developers can.<p>Yes, developers will not learn. The average developer is happy to throw as much jQuery at a problem as they can, and they're happy to go nuts because they own a decent computer, use the latest browsers and have a fast connection. The best front-end developers I've ever known understand these problems and can provide similar or better results in an optimised way.",1348503228

I've used Cassandra, SimpleDB, Voldemort, etc. I wrote part of the Inktomi Search Engine in the 90s, and plenty of (what today would be called) NoSQL stores over the years.<p>A default that's so counterintuitive for a database should be featured prominently with a huge neon sign.

Foxconn's HR issues are in many ways better understood by regarding them as a small country rather than a company. With a population of 1.2 million, all sorts of very unusual things become statistical inevitabilities. By any reasonable measure, Foxconn is in fact exceptionally safe and peaceful.<p>On the topic of whether Foxconn workers are underpaid, they are clearly not - they perform work of exceptionally low value, most of which is performed by hand for no reason other than that Chinese peasants are cheaper than machines. Foxconn operates on very low margins and earns only a tiny fraction of the retail price of the devices they manufacture. The value in consumer electronics is primarily R&D; Without the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars in microelectronics research, these workers would still be peasants and their American and European counterparts would be working 10-hour shifts manufacturing vacuum tubes and phonograph needles.",1348502645

If they pick more than one as I said all of them for example then if one of those vatriations is found to be flawed later on then that subset can be dust and the SH3 standard and implementation can carry on moving on without have the issue of suddenly having nothing to fallback upon.   Sure there are other standards that currently can be fallen back upon but if some kit supports SH3 only then with SH3 having variations as a standard can only be better thing than not.  These finalists have been tested alot already, more so than previous so it is not a case of making it up appraoch at all, they would of had to pass alot of standard/hurdles to get this far.  But what I'm saying is if they all pass all the tests then picking a winner gets down to other nuances and the abilty to have more than one winner add's more rubustness to the standard in that any single solution found later on to have a flaw would negate the whole standard as apposed to a subsection of it by having more than one option, hence the SH3.n.<p>That all said if everybody agreed on everything then life as we know it would be boring and we would all be fighting over the same women at some stage, which would not work out well.",1348502540

At will employment would be, ""I want to work at Google"", and <i>snap</i> you're working at Google.<p>Real life employment is more like: how is the general economy? how is your specific field's economy? If you quit this job, can you last for a while while seeking a new one? Are local firms hiring or do you have to leave your town to find a job? Are your skills still relevant? Do you have a family to feed? Do you have mortgage payments? Are you 1 in 100 kind of programmer, where companies compete to hire you, or 1 in 20, where you can shop around a little? Maybe you are one of 19 in 20, ie average, and you don't get much say. Do you even have had an education, or couldn't afford one? Are you/any member of your family sick, do you absolutely need health coverage?",1330437541

3643135,comment,3642628,3642628,13,0,IgorPartola,,,"Whenever someone says ""We need technology X to go forward. It is our only choice."" I see it as a warning. Is there really no other way forward, even if localStorage <i>is</i> broken? Maybe IndexDB is awesome (I have no idea), but perhaps it's not the holy grail.<p>One example of this is CSS. CSS is leaps and bounds better than, for example, GTK's layout and styling system. It is a huge improvement over spacer images and tables. However, it is far (far, very far) from perfect. Having umpteen different ways to position elements, inconsistent layout/display models, inconsistent implementations, no nesting and even lack of arguable features like constants (why can't I define color <i>main_color</i> = #cc0000; and use that everywhere, so I don't violate DRY principle?). It is important to recognize both the benefits and flaws of all technology we use.<p>Now, it sounds like a lot of the OT's gripe has to do with inconsistent implementations, which are always a huge pain when it comes to web development. However, as some comments suggest, it's at least possible that the spec itself is not broken. Issues like ""it's slow"" or ""it's too small"" seem like implementation details. That's like saying ""JavaScript is slow"" before/after Chrome came around. Right tool for the right job, etc.",1330437452

3643123,comment,3642106,3642106,1,0,SonicSoul,,,"i'm never a fan of these blanket statements such as ""i won't work unpaid overtime"". Some jobs are 35 hours, and some jobs are 70 hours. Some jobs pay 40k, and some jobs pay 200k. Who said that 40hr week is the holy and undisputed threshold everyone should abide by? Look at construction workers, some of them work from sun up to sun down, 6-7 days a week (i sure did when i was younger) and there is no such hour standard. Sure they are often paid on how much work gets done, but at the end of the month, many won't make more than someone with a good salary working in an office writing code. I am not trivializing writing code. that's what i do, and i often work 60-70hr weeks, and sometimes it's a stressful time. But i do get paid accordingly (not in overtime, but i consider my salary to be great), and i do get a lot more done than average person would in 40hrs. I guess if your employer tells you it will be 40hrs and it turns out to be 70, thats a problem. but in my experience most of the time you know exactly what you're getting into when accepting a job (besides occasional crunch times couple times a year).",1330437234

3643110,comment,3642106,3642106,2,0,orblivion,,,"Well, I have an American way of looking at things. Why is 40 hours the magical number? Why is it that you're working for free after that point? He was correct in the first place that it's devaluing your hourly worth (assuming time is fungible). But guess what, if you can't get the job done that the employer wants to pay you the given salary for in the 40 hours you expected to satisfy him with, and the employer would let you go if you told him that this wasn't what you signed up for, you <i>are</i> devalued. The employer hired you for a certain amount of work and was willing to pay a certain amount of money for it. If you made an agreement about the work to be accomplished, and did not make an agreement about hours, and you end up working 80 hours a week, you <i>are</i> being paid overtime. Your base salary is just much lower because you're not worth very much to that particular employer at the base salary.<p>Now, if the employer would <i>not</i> fire you if you put your foot down, it's a matter of knowing your true worth. And I definitely agree it's worth doing this if you end up in this sort of situation. Either you part ways from a job that isn't worth it to you, or you get the conditions that are worth it to you. Negotiations have some leeway, you don't really know what the other person is willing to give up.",1330436944

So my guess would be that diagnosing someone as mentally ill because they act anti-authoritarian comes from the tribal instinct that allowed, or even required, all humans to work together without questioning their orders. It was necessary to hunting, protecting the tribe, etc. that everyone act as one. Not acting as one would cause the hunt to fail or the tribe to lose a battle, either way they would die. It's the same way that packs of animals like wolves behave. Shun the outlier because he could put all our lives at stake.<p>So expanding on this theory, maybe the reason we as humans act this way is because our cousin species died out because they <i>didn't</i> act as one. Perhaps those other semi-human species that died out were more independently-minded, but for the first few hundred thousand years that was a negative thing that led to natural selection filtering them out?<p>I guess I get this idea from Seth Godin's talk about ""Quieting the lizard brain.""

Total cost of employment per employee in China is more expensive than most of Asia.<p>Overtime of more than 36 hours per month for each employee is illegal in China, and the court always sides with the employee even on the scrappiest amount of evidence.<p>China makes up for this with awesome infrastructure reducing logistics costs a lot.  Wage costs are only around 15% of total cost of production for a factory like Foxconn.<p>Some factories do not provide great conditions, but these are mainly small factories with no gloves when handling pollutants, etc.  When I mention small factories, I mean a warehouse with wooden tables, anything with plant and scale is monitored closely.  Monitored by the public with mobile phone cameras as much as by officials.  There is a strong public backlash movement on the Chinese language internet and it is effective.<p>On glass vs. plastic...

There is a big difference between putting someone on pills to stop them from presenting a problem in school or at work, and putting someone on pills to stop them cutting out their own eyes, or to help them regain their desire to breathe in and out.<p>A large number of mental disorders are extremely debilitating and often fatal to the patient. When successfully healed, sufferers are usually extremely grateful to their psychiatrist, feeling that they owe them their life.<p>You only hear in the media and online about the times when it all goes wrong, because it makes a good story. Who wants to hear blog posts about how someone was sick, and then they got well? Especially when talking about your experience with mental illness is seen as an admission of weakness or personal failure by society, which it is.<p>This is not to discount the fact that there <i>is</i> a huge amount of malpractice, abuse, and just plain poor quality thinking out there in the world of psychiatry. Most of it is connected to big pharma and their big dollars, as you might expect.<p>You also can't absolve the patient of all responsibility. Go to any psychiatrist, particularly here in the UK with our NHS where doctors don't sit around <i>hoping</i> for more ill people, and they will tell you that they are sick and tired of the parade of perfectly healthy middle class idiots shuffling before them with non-problems, or worse, dragging children with non-problems.<p>You can't really just turn these people away, it's unethical (illegal?) to just deny someone treatment. Unless you can invoke something like Mnchausen syndrome, you have to treat these people or their charges in some way if they are in distress. Doctors are reduced to giving them some pills and complaining to each other behind closed doors about the endless stream of ""worried well"" affecting their ability to help those with the actual problems discussed at the start of this now overly-long comment. Actually, increasingly they send them off to a homeopathy clinic or something like that. That in my eyes is the one good use for alternative medicine, it keeps little jemima off the hard stuff when her dangerously irrational mother decides she needs to be fixed.<p>The DSM and it's ilk make this worse by giving the public cosmo-style checklists they can run against themselves, without all the other contextual understanding that a diagnostician has.

3643039,comment,3641184,3642393,2,0,ekianjo,,,"I disagree with your point that ""private property is an invention of the State"". There is no need for any state to claim property on something. As you said, as long as you can defend what you have, it ""belongs"" to you. I'm pretty sure prehistoric men had a concept of property. Even animals have a sense of property. A dog will defend the bone it likes to chew on. A bird will fight to defend its nest. Property is rather natural.<p>I however agree when you say that intellectual property is an invention of the State, because that is precisely where it originates: the granting of monopoly to an individual by the hand of the King. There is no natural root in intellectual property.<p>> workers who lived in ""company towns"", in a life one step away from indentured servitude<p>Again, please put this rhetoric in perspective, not in the eyes of a 21st century person from a developped society, but in the eyes of a person of that time, who had the choice between staying in an enpoverished countryside, potentially victim of starvation and malnourishment, and the perspective of having a stable, paid job in a factory. People were NOT stupid. They made the choice of ""more gains"", not less. They ended up richer and in better position than where they started. They progressed on the social ladder. The very same story is happening with all these workers in China, queuing outside of Foxconn to get a good and sustainable job, compared to the Nothing they had in the countryside.<p>> The common thread between democracy and capitalism is to lessen the corrupting influence of power by distributing it: one person = one vote<p>Totally agree with the decentralization of power, but democracy is a poor tool to reach that goal. You elect high ranking officials who are above the laws. Who are all RICH, without exception. Who have immense powers over other individuals. And who can use violence to force their laws on you, or make you go to war and lose your life if they decide to do so. Government is, by itself, a huge body of asymmetrical power against individuals. You do not ""choose"" it, when you are born you are already, automatically, subject to it.<p>When you buy some goods, however, every dollar you spend is a vote for a product, a company. Should that company screw up, you will not buy it again. Its reputation will worsen. It will lose customers. It may go bankrupt. It is, actually, at the mercy of the decentralized power of customers who AGREE to buy it everyday or on a regular basis.<p>Governments (almost) never go bankrupt. Instead, they will tax you to death, they will take your property and declare it theirs (like when they forbid possession of Gold). And they will use violence to punish you and put you away in prison if you do not comply. And you will have no way out, but to leave the country (if you can).<p>Governments CAN be useful, but I think in most developed countries they have gone way further than what their initial role was supposed to be. That's a vast subject, anyway.",1330435347

3643007,comment,3641212,3642937,7,0,muyuu,,,"That's correct, and I use GCC for this. For some time I've also used m4 to pre-process namespaces and output C99-standard code. That would be my preferred way when I can get away with it because C++ compilers introduce uncanny little differences that can haunt you in some hedge cases, but it adds an extra step and then I'm doing something that doesn't work in the outside world.<p>For me, the biggest argument against C++ is that programmers can make much better use of their time than learning the massive list of quirks in C++ compilers. Having more features is not a deal breaker per se, even if it does cater to messy code. In real world situations you can usually choose a compiler for the whole team and a style for the whole team. This works in my company. But you have to be aware that this doesn't have to work in all situations, or even most situations.<p>With inline functions and dynamic variable declarations already in C99, I really think the complexity/usefulness compromise of adding anything else that is also available in C++ is very, very negative.<p>For other higher level features there are many other languages I'd take over C++. Ruby, LISP, Python, even Java or C# if you're that fond of C-ish syntax. For low-level stuff and speed, nothing higher level than what I said above. In my team C++ is nobody's favourite language but it's still what we use the most. Sadly, there are many other factors other than personal preference.",1330434455

Really: open lkml.org and search for his posts. Most of the time, he's an ordinary project maintainer.<p>Sometimes, he's quite the opposite of a jerk [1]:<p><pre><code>    WARNING! I wasn't kidding when I said that I've done this by reading
    gtk2 tutorials as I've gone along.  If somebody is more comfortable with
    gtk, feel free to send me (signed-off) patches.
    
    Just as an example of the extreme hackiness of the code, I don't even
    bother connecting a signal for the ""somebody edited the dive info""
    cases.  I just save/restore the dive info every single time you switch
    dives.  Christ! That's truly lame.
</code></pre>
One must remember that his role as maintainer of linux requires him to have ultimate, non-ambiguous opinion about a lot of stuff. He's the judge of what effectively goes into the ""official"" kernel tree. Moreover, most of the kernel contributors don't deal with him directly  git is the materialization of that <i>modus operandi</i>.<p>When he <i>does</i> express himself like that, however, it becomes news. He always has a reason, though. In this case:<p><pre><code>    Please don't talk about portability, it's BS.

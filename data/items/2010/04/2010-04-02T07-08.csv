1236169,comment,1236048,1236048,0,0,3h49ry7zg,,,"I'm quite confused why this is getting attention.  It's not hugely difficult to enable a public IPv6 address on a server alongside the IPv4 address.  The advantage of doing so?  If one runs a serious website, there are many more back-end servers that handle database requests etc. than there are user-facing webservers, and all of these back-end servers can use IPv6 to talk to each other and the webservers.  If IPv6 addresses are cheaper and easier to get, then it's a win for the company.  They can upgrade each internal client-server pair to IPv6 in unison since they're a single organization.",1270194617

1236161,comment,1235791,1235791,0,0,car,,,"Some cultural observations about shoes on the table, feces on the sidewalk, and what it all means.<p>a) shoes on table<p>Western Europeans also find the gesture of shoes on chairs and tables repulsive, both in public and in private.<p>In my experience, shoes on the table in public seems to be a US specific behavior, but please correct me if I'm wrong. You know, something you'd see in a Western. It's a very laissez faire gesture, of a confident and free people, unlike the stuck up Europeans with all their rules.<p>The most memorable experience for me was with the CEO of a company where I worked. He would do this in every meeting, even when we met with executives of another company. It could have been a dominance gesture, but more likely his hippy attitude.<p>I've also observed that people in the US tend to put their shoes where others will sit or put their hands, e.g. chairs, benches etc.<p>b) dog poo<p>People in the US pick up after their dogs, I find this great! A lot of Europeans don't, which is super nasty. The memory of dogshit in Paris and Berlin, especially on a hot summer day, makes me want to puke. Google for Paris and dogshit and see what I mean.<p>a + b) what it means<p>Now, to each their own, but from a hygiene/medical standpoint, shoes on chairs and tables should not be done. Let me explain why.<p>Even with no visible dogshit under your shoe, there are myriad diseases that can be transferred this way. It does not have to be as horrible as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_multilocularis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_multilocularis</a>, but there are many others. Eggs of parasitic worms hosted by domestic animals are quite hardy. That's why I'd say, leave you shoes (not necessarily feet) of chairs and tables. Why risk infecting yourself and others? Like wearing a seatbelt, a simple behavior that can save your life.",1270193874

(e.g. untrusted data being escaped before display in an web app (XSS prevention), e.g. charset conversions being performed)?<p>It would require more work (valgrind would need a different set of things to warn on, and a way of realising when some memory has been made safe).<p>All very reminiscent of perl's taint mode (scalar values are flagged with a contagious 'taint bit', which prevents their use in output, calls to 'system()' etc.)",1270193690

1236153,comment,1235791,1235937,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""Do it in India and your boss would fire you, instantly.""<p>You must have worked for some really sick companies in India to be ""instantly fired"" for putting your legs up on the desk. That kind of behaviour is appropriate(maybe) for some medieval feudal environment (lese majeste) but hardly in the 21st century. In any Indian company I worked for (and I've worked for a few), if a boss attempted to fire his subordinate just for putting his feet on the desk, the <i>boss</i> would be out of a job in record time.<p>Now if you went to America and expected an American to act by Indian norms and did something (by your admission  <i>not
 offensive</i> by <i>American</i> norms)  and you felt all offended and huffy and ""lost respect"" for him on that basis, you are the idiot, not him. When you are in grad school, working etc in another country <i>you</i> should follow <i>their</i> norms as much as possible, not they yours.<p>Why don't you come back to India (I am an Indian and live in India these days and so ""come"" instead of ""go"") where you can be surrounded by people who follow your norms to the letter.<p>But then, norms vary widely across India as well (though obviously not as much as between India and America) so you might want to go back to the exact village or city you came from and never step out of it. That way you won't have to meet ""fuckers"" you ""instantly lose respect for"".<p>You must be a pleasure to work with and just the type of person who'd be comfortable in an informal startup atmosphere or on a college project team ;-). With your hyper sensitivity to ""insult"", I assume you constantly researched all things potentially offensive to all nationalities you encountered (and in an American University you must have encountered a few dozen) and kept this data up to date on a continuous basis.",1270193383

There was a time when it was fashionable to figure it out yourself but that went the way of Martha Stewart.  While I get all of my news from the Naked News (.com) network I believe what was best about CNN was Lou Dobbs.  At least you knew where he stood and if you liked that you would tune into it.

I've never seen anyone prop their feet up on a table during a meeting and judging from the appearance of the gesture in various kinds of videos, I don't think it is common anywhere in Europe at all. This means that any explanation that calls on something crosscultural like 'wanting to relax' falls short. There is something more behind it, even if no one that does it realizes it.",1270192926

1236144,comment,1235791,1235937,0,0,steamboiler,,,"""While it clearly isn't considered offensive in the US, it's still a pretty rude gesture""<p>There are a bunch of other gestures that meet the same criterion. I am Indian, so I'll list some I'm familiar with:<p>1. Not addressing your teacher/professor as ""Sir/Madam"". Addressing a teacher as Mr. X/Professor Y is verboten.<p>2. Displaying photos of your family at work (mild, but yes)<p>3. ""Disrespecting"" your elders/teachers/bosses with counterarguments.  
...<p>On the social front, you'd be expected to<p>1. Not address your elders solely by their first name.<p>2. Not cohabit with the opposite sex before marriage.<p>3. Not smoke/drink.<p>4. Not eat pork/beef.<p>5. Not change your gender.<p>Which of these did you object to/are you going to object to? Will you refuse to work with someone trans-gendered, as would happen ""instantly"" in India?<p>The fact is, you were in the US <i>not</i> India. I would argue that the onus is on you to adjust yourself to the customs of your hosts rather than the other way around. Just as an Indian would expect any US (or otherwise foreign) visitors to keep in mind the Indian customs.<p>PS: you used two epithets to describe your teacher in the same paragraph. I find it amusing that your ""Indian"" sensibility (Guru! Respect!) is not offended by it.",1270192581

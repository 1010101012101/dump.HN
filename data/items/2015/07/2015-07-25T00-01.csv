It allows you to have edge locations closer to your users, and it gives you something which is (effectively) 100% reliable.  You never have to do maintenance, never have to reboot instances or worry about scaling.  It&#x27;s faster, usually cheaper, and more reliable.<p>In terms of which CDN you should use, there are a few options.  CloudFront has the most edge locations, Fastly and MaxCDN are more configurable.  At Eager we use CloudFront for our app (<a href=""https://eager.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eager.io</a>), and Fastly (with a CloudFront fallback) for the static files we serve our users.  One other note is that Fastly has some cheaper SSL options than CF, particularly if you need support for Windows XP clients.",1437785739

If the upstream is not responsive, that&#x27;s different.   The point is not artificially creating fires and surprises <i>unnecessarily</i>, which put thousands or millions of systems at <i>avoidable</i> risk.   Patches need to get out there as soon as possible when good faith is working and PoCs need to be released anyhow if upstream is unresponsive.   This accountability will ensure that preventative, cooperative fixes are released as soon as possible with minimum damage.   Because of a premature PoC were used to takedown life/safety or major business concerns, there will be additional fallout.  Playing fast and loose and dismissing concerns of large-scale installed bases is not a strategy, it&#x27;s either ignorance or hubris.  Causing emergencies and putting people unnecessary risk is nearly always preventable bullshit.  There are only a few cases where upstream developers are unable, incapable or unwilling to patch something in good faith that it should be released... And in some cases where the fix is tricky, there should be an occasional, mutually-agreed short deferment.  Again, avoid unnecessary harm to users by applying common sense rather than unrealistic dogma &quot;full disclosure right now, fuck everyone else.&quot;",1437785699

Thanks for mentioning &quot;derivative work&quot;, it&#x27;s a good key word to look into this further.  After skimming <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work</a> I guess one question is, is applying cryptography &quot;transformative&quot;?<p>To take it in a slightly different direction, since parody has been upheld, what about a deterministic, reversible, mechanical parodic transformation?  AFAIK machine-created works can&#x27;t be given a copyright, but I&#x27;m not asking for that, merely that a machine can create a sufficiently transformative derivative work.<p>In fact, maybe it doesn&#x27;t even need to be parody.

The purpose of a trademark is to indicate the origin of goods and services - thus sane trademark registration requires that a mark being registered meets certain basic requirements. One of those requirements is that a mark not be a common term in the field. A trademark has to be distinct.<p>Google is distinct in the field of search engines as it&#x27;s both a neonym (ie neologism, made up word) and a word that is not especially pertinent to the particular field of commerce. That is why it&#x27;s Google and not Googol, neologism&#x27;s are better because it&#x27;s far easier to establish uses that are infringing.<p>You /can/ use almost anything as a trademark but there are restrictions on what can be a registered trademark.<p>So back to Disney.<p>&quot;Snow White&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be allowed as a trademark as it&#x27;s a traditional term in the fields of story telling/movies/cartoons/fiction. Just as a fruit sellers can&#x27;t have [the word mark] Apple as a registered trademark so too it is normal to reject marks that would prevent people from merely describing their goods (as opposed to indicating the origin of those goods [or services]).<p>Thus to my &quot;wrong, wrong, wrong&quot; statement - Snow White is a perfectly good mark outside the fields of fiction, eg for a hair care product. But allowing the registration of a mark for a Nice class in which that word is widely used descriptively is insane. &quot;Snow White&quot; can only practically indicate the origin of goods/services outside the field of fiction/media.<p>>Trade marks and copyright are totally separate beasts<p>Except in these instances they&#x27;re not. Because trademarks don&#x27;t expire (as long as you pay renewals and manage to avoid genericisation, etc.) then a common method of protecting copyright works as they pass in to the public domain is to use RTMs to bind as much as possible of the IP away from the public domain; eg getting RTMs on character names. This way it is more risky for firms to sell the now public works and the ability to create franchises and such is made far harder - you can create a new Snow White series and use &quot;Snow White&quot; descriptively but then you attempt to create merchandise and oh look Disney own the names of your central characters.",1437784993

In my experience, it is more often used as a spark for a larger confrontation or an excuse to bash males in general.<p>> I never said anything about forcing or denying abortions, only that a woman has the right to cede responsibility for reproduction whereas a man has none. If a woman chooses to abort or put a child up for adoption, she is well within her rights to do so. If a man suggests the same thing, he is a &quot;deadbeat&quot;.<p>In an ideal world, a father would be told of the pregnancy immediately, and given the opportunity to absolve himself of responsibility for it.  With this knowledge in hand, the mother would have the opportunity to decide to abort, give up for adoption, or keep the child with the understanding that there would be no (legally mandated) financial support from the father.<p>> So as long as an exaggerated body image is accompanied by power and dominance, it shouldn&#x27;t place unfair expectations on impressionable viewers?<p>I most often see it as a corollary to arguments about the representation of women in movies/TV/video games.  If the representation of a fictional woman is attacked for unrealistic standards, the rebuttal will be that the men are held to the same standards by male characters in the same space.  Feminists then reply that it is a &quot;male power fantasy&quot; and does not count.<p>A perfect example, and most of the women&#x27;s &quot;before&quot; representations aren&#x27;t even unrealistic to begin with!<p><a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/lara-croft-gets-a-realistic-makeover-from-eating-disorder-support-group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/lara-croft-gets-a-realistic...</a><p>> The idea of sexuality as being negative is also unhealthy, for both genders.<p>A &quot;sex positive&quot; outlook would not care whether or not Bayonetta was designed by or for men.  Bayonetta would have the inherent right to dress and behave as she pleases, with no care for the viewer&#x27;s tastes.<p>> Men also can and do suffer terrible experiences as the hands of women, and can be dominated by them. If a woman gets &quot;safe spaces&quot;, so, too, should men.<p>If you go to a college campus and attempt to set up a &quot;mens center&quot; in the same vein as the womens centers that are increasingly common, you will most likely be 1) called a misogynist, 2) not taken seriously, 3) not succeed.<p>You will also very likely be harassed and carry the &quot;misogynist&quot; label for the remainder of your tenure there.  School newspapers will have carte blanche to drag your name through the mud in any way they can.

He has seen harassment and vitriol slung at him primarily from the &quot;feminist&quot; side, and even a great deal from people that could be considered celebrities.  Those people will gladly attack him, and have absolutely no fear of reprisal for doing so.<p>The only time they face the consequences for their actions is when they upset their own compatriots.

The only people with a straight-up benefit from this are malware writers who don&#x27;t want to work very hard converting the patch into an exploit.<p>Researchers should delay the publishing of exploits at least a week so people can test and deploy the patch. I keep mentioning testing because patches sometimes break stuff themselves. Doing otherwise just saves attackers work.",1437782669

People could choose to make it illegal.<p>Also note that when the police do it they take precautions such as having bright multi-colored lights on the car to draw attention.<p>It also bothers me that the Wired guy didn&#x27;t know what was going to happen, so he couldn&#x27;t prepare as well. Even that would have helped (though I still think the stunt was dangerous enough for someone to go to jail).<p>> But not jail, like for the evil hackers-not-researchers?<p>We can&#x27;t put a company in jail and we don&#x27;t usually do it with the CEO for much bigger crimes. I doubt the CEO had any idea this could happen.<p>I imagine this is one of those things where dozens of people in different departments (and even companies due to auto parts suppliers) all made small but not terrible bad decisions that added up to a huge problem. I doubt there is a smoking gun email someone where a manager says &#x27;I know someone could disable the car on the freeway but it will save us millions!&#x27;<p>And while this is happening to FCA there are other cars with cell connected systems (VW, BMW, Audi, others). I imagine if we had enoug time we&#x27;d find at least 2 or 3 other companies with vulnerable systems in other car brands&#x27;s 2015 models.<p>I just don&#x27;t see how we could jail anyone in FCA. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t call for it. On the other hand the hackers seems like a pretty cut and try case.<p>> That&#x27;s just petty, and nobody really cares what you call them.<p>The words you use to describe something matter. Having taken such a stupid risk I don&#x27;t see why they should ask to be acknowledged on the same level as security professionals who don&#x27;t put people in danger for headlines.<p>Frankly the number of people in these threads defending the overly dangerous demo scares me, as does the number of people who seem to tacitly <i>encourage</i> such behavior.",1437782602

It implies that men are rapists who don&#x27;t know any better, and need educated on what rape is and how not to do it.  It implies that all men are sociopaths, and need to be taught basic human empathy.<p>Saying that all/many/most men are rapists is an unsupportable claim, as in much of the Western world rape has been (and still is) defined specifically as unwanted male-on-female penetration.  Until statistics can be presented that have substantiated backing, this is an unfair assessment.<p>&quot;Teach X not to Y&quot; is an ineffective method for preventing Y.  You can put everyone in the world in a class telling them not to mug, murder, rape, pillage, stab, shoot, or use the Oxford Comma.  People will still act according to their own personal motivations and (presence or lack of) morals.  If I want to prevent myself from being mugged, I will learn to recognize the sort of dangerous situations that could lead to that eventuality.  I will take personal responsibility for my safety.  I will also understand that there will be times that there was nothing I could have reasonably done to prevent it from happening, if it should.",1437782600

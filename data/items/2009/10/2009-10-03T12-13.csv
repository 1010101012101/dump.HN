In the case of a high performing or highly specialized group, the question comes down to who does the measuring and how much power would she have to say letting someone go isn't necessary. I'm just speculating, but my guess is that the powers up high at Enron wouldn't have let that slide.<p>We should also remember that this article was published just 6 months before Enron filed bankruptcy. While ranking and fire sounds sane in principle, we have to wonder how much this sort of hire-fast-fire-fast policy contributed to the systemic and ethical break downs that have made the company infamous.",1254572498

858724,comment,858655,858680,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> They were the lucky ones, of course. The consensus estimate is that 70 million human beings have died so far during the CCP's reign of terror, mostly from starvation. My wife spent much of her youth hungry. She and her friends used to pull the stingers out of honeybees to get a bit of sweetness in their lives. The things little girls do, huh?<p>I dated a Chinese girl for 3 and 1/2 years whose father was sent to a labor camp for a lot of her childhood.<p>I really don't understand how the Communists don't have the same reputation and stigma of the Nazis. They killed over twice as many people, most of them civilians, and did it for twice as long. They ran their countries into the ground in pretty much all meaningful measures, destroying civilizations well known for science, commerce, and innovation. They accomplished almost nothing of value, in any of the areas mankind finds valuable. And they're treated with a mild disdain, but nothing like the Third Reich, where they probably deserve even worse treatment.<p>If anyone doesn't know who Deng Xiaoping is, it's worth reading a little bit about him. He was probably one of the most important and good politicians of the last 100 years. He helped lead China out of the Communist mess they were in, declaring, ""It doesn't matter what color the cat is as long as it catches the mouse."" Was imprisoned for a while due to his views before taking over and putting China back on the path to being a global power with healthy, happy citizens.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping</a><p>But as a casual historian, I'm still baffled why the Communists don't have the same or worse of a rep than the Nazis - input from knowledgeable people is welcome.",1254572147

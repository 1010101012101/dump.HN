If three is little friction between the language and the needs of client-side code then the drop in context switch need between the two could be worth it to some people.<p>Much like using Javascript server-side when most considered it a client-side only language (an opinion that is pretty much dying away now - the remaining people who don&#x27;t like the idea of it server-side don&#x27;t like it client side either).",1437746399

Like the author said, the procedure itself was painless (and very fast, a few minutes per eye).<p>I had the surgery done early in the morning, and afterward slept through most of the day to let my eyes heal. I woke up the next day and was able to read car license plates across the street, where two days prior my vision was bad enough that I couldn&#x27;t make out facial features over an arm&#x27;s length away without my glasses.<p>I&#x27;ll second the author: it was one of the best decisions I ever made.",1437746364

- move all jpegs from card, keep raws there
- go through jpegs, select &quot;best&quot; (ie worth further work), for worthy ones take RAW from card instead of jpeg
- select panoramas to join in autopano
- join panoramas (source is jpeg, if anybody knows how to do it with Nikon Raws, please share!)
- select best panoramas (often quality is visible only after all is rendered)
- if I have multiple sources (photos, panos with different naming, GF camera, Gopro, phones etc.) I make one single unified ordering based on file names (this is crude process, but no clue about anything better)
- process those Raws in Lightroom, put them back
- post on flickr for parents (don&#x27;t have FB) 
- select even more for FB albums for all rest
- delete all raws on memory card (ie except those few worthy processing that were moved from it)<p>cumbersome process, but I simply don&#x27;t like the workflow Lightroom is forcing me to use, so I use it only for Raw edits.

I used to have to keep a bottle of eye drops at my desk but haven&#x27;t even bought a bottle in a few months.<p>I was happy with just using inexpensive daily wear contacts. But at some point my eyes changed, one got a little worse than the other, and I had noticeable astigmatism. This required me to get toric lenses and they were much, much more expensive.

Some form of allergy made my eye doctor tell me I should stop using contacts. But still, I won&#x27;t do LASIK(1). For a few reasons.<p>First, there&#x27;s this thought of having a software-controlled laser beam digging pits in the cornea. And pits they are, it&#x27;s not like the laser pulses create a smooth surface, we are long ways away from that.<p>Second, there&#x27;s the corneal flap, which never fully heals.<p>Third, related to the second point, there&#x27;s the fact that the cornea is cut and some nerves are permanently damage, which could create a dry eye condition. Apparently people commit suicide over that. And my eyes are not that moist to begin with, AC already bothers them.<p>Reason four is the fact that, even if 100% successful and a 20/20 results is achieved, your vision can still be really poor. Halos are just one of many (common!) conditions that aren&#x27;t really correctable and you&#x27;ll have to live with forever.<p>Last, LASIK surgeries are rather new. The first LASIK patients should be now reaching old age. And the first generation LASIK equipment was pretty poor, so any problems they have are blamed on that. But what if I do a LASIK today, and have really nasty complications as I age? They are unlikely to be corrected.<p>Does anyone remember that procedure where surgeons would cut the patient&#x27;s eye radially to try to correct nearsightedness? Some of those patients tried LASIK later, with really poor results due to a weak cornea. Not to mention the nasty complications. That procedure sounds barbaric now.<p>I just hope LASIK won&#x27;t be seen like that too in a few years.<p>[1] I&#x27;m still on the fence about LASEK. Recovery is reportedly horrible, but at least there&#x27;s no deep corneal cutting.",1437745617

The other day I read that DMT produces psychedelic experiences that often involve a common thread that is somewhat similar to a &quot;council of invisible cosmic entities:&quot; multiple technologically advanced entities.<p><pre><code>     Strassman (2001) reported that “about half” of the 60 volunteers entered 
     what he described as “freestanding, independent levels of existence” of a 
     highly unusual nature. These places were inhabited by what volunteers 
     described as intelligent “beings”, “entities”, “aliens”, “guides”, and 
     “helpers”... ...Strangely enough, reports of these kinds of beings seem 
     to be unique to DMT, as Strassman was unable to find anything similar in 
     the research literature on other psychedelic drugs.   
     
     There were some consistent themes in experiences of entity contact. 
     Participants frequently reported that the beings seemed to be waiting for 
     them. Volunteers were subjected to an examination by these beings in what 
     appeared to be a technologically advanced setting. Volunteers felt 
     like their mind and body was probed and tested, or even modified in some 
     unexplained way. The beings communicated with the user through gestures
     
     ...Strassman noted the striking parallels between these entity contact 
     experiences and accounts of alien abduction. 
     
     Intriguingly, many volunteers refused to believe that these experiences 
     were hallucinations or dreams, as they seemed too real. Strassman reported 
     being initially quite baffled by and unprepared for the frequency of these 
     entity experiences among his volunteers...

Long term effects:<p>- I suffered from the night halo effect for two years afterwards, but it went away. Even then, I was happy having done the surgery.<p>- I am more light-sensitive now than I was. I&#x27;m uncomfortable without sunglasses in a bright summer day, something that didn&#x27;t happen before. From what I can tell I&#x27;m still in the normal light sensitivity band.<p>- My eyes are drier now than before surgery. Again, not something that affects day to day life. I notice it mostly when the eye gets irritated somehow (after swimming in salty water or chlorinated water, after being in smoky environments or being exposed to dust).<p>Doctors routinely downplay both the halo effect and the reduced tear production. The halo effect is more common in high correction surgeries (my correction was 3 dioptries myopic correction and 4(left) and 6(right) asthigmatic correction, which is rather high).<p>If you have already reduced tear production, I&#x27;d advise against the surgery. From people I know who did LASIK, that&#x27;s the only relevant downside people talk about. Having permanently dry eyes and permanent need for drops is worse than wearing glasses.<p>It isn&#x27;t painful, but I was uncomfortable for a couple weeks.

It has worked very well so far: I do get halos, but haven&#x27;t had any other complications. The implants can also be removed or replaced.<p>* Implantable Contact Lens, from Wikipedia: The procedure is performed under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The flexibility of the ICL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the soft silicone tip of the micro incision injector through a very small incision (2.2mm) thus avoiding the need for stitches, and this procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. Following the procedure, most people have immediate use of their eyes. The full recovery period is typically 1–2 days with minimal discomfort and most patients are able to go to work the next day. After surgery, the common advice is to avoid driving home and to visit the attending ophthalmologists regularly for several months so as to monitor the implants.

In addition to the patent situation, there were just basic things like having a <i>huge</i> spec which for a long time was neither freely available nor accompanied by a public test suite.<p>I work with librarians who have large scanned digital collections and it was definitely interesting to compare the reactions: the users disliked JPEG 2000 because they&#x27;d been conditioned to expect it to be quite noticeably slower, unsupported by some of their tools, and knew that they couldn&#x27;t rely on any two programs actually working with a given set of files until they tested it (<a href=""http://jpylyzer.openpreservation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jpylyzer.openpreservation.org/</a> has helped catch that earlier).<p>Meanwhile, the JPEG-2000 standards people & other boosters just tended to assume inevitability, where everyone would drop other formats once they saw how inferior they were. Things like Photoshop <i>removing</i> JPEG-2000 support (first discussed publicly in 2007, dropped in Elements in 2011) had this odd effect where some people expressed considerable concern (<a href=""http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JPEG+2000+support+discontinued+in+Photoshop+Elements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JPEG+2000+support+discon...</a>) but others just assumed it was some sort of unrepresentative quirk.<p>I cannot help but think that the situation would be considerably different if something like OpenJPEG.org had gotten significant support much earlier.

Valid reason. But he perfectly knew he was getting a proprietary OS, not Arch.<p>> because if you follow the Unix philosophy, each component is modular and replaceable
Who told him OS X follows the Unix philosophy? Also I don&#x27;t understand the obsession with applying the Unix philosophy to everything. Give me a good full-featured browser and email program, keep your Surf (<a href=""http://surf.suckless.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://surf.suckless.org</a>) and mutt if you want.<p>> Make it easy to compile, test and run any kind of software I&#x27;d like
Yes, like you can do already on OS X since forever. Obviously if you&#x27;re going to do Linux kernel development OS X is not ideal and I think everybody can agree on that one. But for UNIX/POSIX software it&#x27;s pretty much the same. You can get GCC from MacPorts and I guess Homebrew too, pretty much any version you want, if you don&#x27;t like Clang (which is the default compiler in FreeBSD too btw).<p>> Be transparent in its workings, be easy to understand in principle
100% agreed on this one.<p>> Should be a separate entity. It should not rely on some third-party service in order to function properly. If I can&#x27;t access the internet (or choose to airgap the machine eternally), it should be possible to run all of the software I&#x27;d like (and to use all of the features I&#x27;d like to) without needing access to online services.
I really don&#x27;t understand this one. This is OS X, not Chrome OS. You don&#x27;t need an Apple ID to update the OS itself. You can get programs from the internet or your favorite package manager without ever logging in with your Apple ID on the App Store.<p>> A package manager is useless if it doesn&#x27;t manage all of the packages on a system
I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;useless&quot;, but I guess if you prefer a package manager for everything then MacPorts/Homebrew are not for you.<p>He then mentions that OS X has a &quot;horrible development environment&quot; without giving any actual reason, and mentions too &quot;filesystem pollution&quot; because OS X separates most GUI tools from the BSD tools (so he considers a logical separation between the BSD subsystem and the rest of the system &quot;pollution&quot;.

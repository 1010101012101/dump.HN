Wealth will mean that art, health and relaxation will be in high demand.""<p>Yes, I agree to an extent. But I must ask, wealth for who? Certainty not for the people no longer employed in the jobs that were ""automated away"". Other labor markets must exist to absorb those that became unemployed as the result of automation.<p>> Now 2% of people work on farms, does that mean we have 88% unemployment?<p>%2 of the population is capable of producing the the labor of 88% (or any number > %2) because of the introduction of technological and methodological advances in farming. Roughly from the middle of the 19th century to the present, the production of food fundamentally changed in character from relatively small-scale primitive production (think horse-drawn plough and peasant or slave labor) to large-scale, technological production (mechanical threshers, high-yield genetically modified seeds, effective pesticides, etc). Agriculture became much like any other industry, and as such, was revolutionized. It was inevitable.<p>I think as someone else on this thread already pointed out, the other 88%, for the most part, had no other choice than relocate to the population centers seeking work. Many found it as unskilled factory labor. The pay was universally poor, and only through the gains made by widespread unionization of both trade (American Federation of Labor) and unskilled or semi-skilled workers (Congress of Industrial Organizations), were workers able to achieve a livable wage.<p>> ""The more we have robots automate the more wealth we will have, the more wealth we have the the greater the number musicians, artists and yoga instructors we will have""<p>So basically we will have a society where current industrialists will own the overwhelming majority of robotic labor (property), whereas the rest of use will be ""employed"" as small scale artisans?<p>> Creating wealth doesn't destroy jobs long term, ""A rising tide raises all boats"", however short term many people will be displaced and have no jobs during the transition. (Short term could be many years).<p>As I said, only if other labor markets exists to absorb the newly unemployed. Whether such markets already exist or are created, is up for society to determine. It may take years for new markets to form, leading high unemployment for quite a while. Historically speaking, when power looms and other such mechanical devices were introduced into factory production, new labor markets did manifest to absorb <i>some</i> of the unemployed in the from of engineers and repairmen. Of course the introduction of machines was not without struggle (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots</a> as an example).",1265935960

Neither the church nor certain secular humanists have a monopoly on the truth or scientific fact.<p>> I see the debates on forums and blogs as being mostly heavy on opinions and weak on facts. And I see religion as a form of ideology.<p>Most internet debates are nothing but a circle jerk. I increasingly see pop-atheism as an ideology too.

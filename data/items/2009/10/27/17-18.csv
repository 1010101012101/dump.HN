905911,comment,905465,905465,0,0,bjm,,,"I used to use Flex for AIR development, but I think I'm about to switch to HTML/JavaScript now. Here are a few reasons:<p>- I can reuse more (code, designs, etc.). This, obviously, will vary for different people. If you are Flash/Flex developer already your situation will likely to be quite the opposite.<p>- HTML is easier than MXML. Obviously, this is somewhat subjective, too.<p>- jQuery. HTML/CSS/JS wins.<p>- Webkit (HTML) engine is less clunky than Flex. GUIs are, IMHO, snappier when built with Webkit, and this is very important to me. Also, Webkit support for effects and animations is surprisingly good (although Flash beats it easily in this area).<p>- Aptana IDE is free and is very good (never tried Dreamweaver, though)<p>So, here you have another opinion. However, it is worth stating that Adobe favors use of Flash/Flex for developing AIR applications (not sure why), so you'll have to jump through some hoops in order to get started. Aptana helps a <i>lot</i>.<p>Finally, I must say that it's a pity you have to choose. Ideally, you would combine the best of both worlds for your app. And although technically feasible (Flash libraries can be used in a HTML project, and HTML pages can be loaded into Flex application), it is very hard to do, because of the two totally different IDEs (Flex Builder and Aptana) which make debugging such ""cross-over"" application very hard. So, I guess you'll have to choose. Good luck!",1256666059

The naive version imagines that the USA suffers an actual attempt at a military coup, and that the coup is defeated by gunfights started by armed citizens. The sophisticated version asks about ambitious young men: when they dream of gaining political power, what route to the top do they dream of?<p>If you are an ambitious young man in a country that has had military coups in the recent past, you might join the army, hoping to rise in ranks and be in the right place at the right time.

In PHP you can have all kinds of levels of abstraction (and I use a multitude of levels).  It is just as interesting that you assume most levels of abstraction are not possible.<p>If you call that a complicated a database query, we're clearly working at different levels.  Get back to me when you hit 100 lines of SQL.<p>> I think that is called ""blub"". You should try deeper abstractions some time... Don't think that pounding on your keys as fast as possible makes your productive -- it doesn't.<p>The self-righteousness and ignorance here is absolutely astounding.",1256662981

These statements are so common it can feel disgusting. The counterstrike neckbeards of my generation would always go into CS half assed, learn java and usually not do it as a hobby. The new WOW generation are doing the same thing now. If someone wants to be a game programmer I think it's better to have a passion for programming and math first rather than a passion of games. As far as programming the internet is a better resource than any school could be. As far as game companies hiring people I think there's a better chance in getting a job if you're really great at art and creating environments. People have always been full of shit, but the only one you can blame for letting it affect you is you.",1256662891

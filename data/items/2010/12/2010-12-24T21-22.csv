Because vi's commands are all case sensitive, combined with the fact that I used capslock a lot for coding, it was kind of a pain.  Also this language did not use a c-like syntax with punctuation, it instead used a lot of english words.<p>Later when I switched to editing C source code with vi, suddenly vi's quirks and methods of operation become far, far more productive than they were using vi.",1293227994

Doubly so if only the suspect is injured.<p>I realize they charged them with ""attempted lynching"" here, but ""resisting arrest"" is by far the more common charge.  Mind you, I'm not saying that one can't resist arrest or that it shouldn't be a crime, only that I wish more people were wise to the abuse of that charge and that they knew to look for warning signs that it's being used abusively.  Specifically, I would consider it to be a warning sign if:  no cops are injured, there's heavily injured suspect especially when they're disproportionately injured compared to the hypothetical threat they might pose to an officer (two large cops shouldn't be very threatened by a small, unarmed kid), no weapons are found or alleged to have been seen, officer say-so is the only evidence of the crime, suspect is charged with no crime except resisting, contradictory or non-existent testimony about what they were arresting for to begin with and any other contradictions in the evidence.",1293227457

It actually doesn't make much sense especially considering the paranoid nature of many of their techie customers.  Yes, Amazon has business before the Feds so they might have wanted to keep them happy up to a certain point, but this seems to have been a big rash decision if they were just acting on a phone call from Lieberman.<p>What I've been wondering, considering how quickly and strangely PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, also  acted, if what really happened here was that they received some kind of National Security Letter. NSL's are subpoenas from the government that also include a gag order preventing you from talking about the letter.  NSL's were supposedly ruled unconstitutional after the government had issued 192,499(!) of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are unknown unchallenged variations of the letter or loopholes that allow the government to still threaten businesses without them being able to talk about it or defend themselves.",1293227122

If you're doing penetration testing in the enterprise space, it's unlikely that you're able to connect to their core network through WiFi. I do network consulting for a medium-large business ($300 mil market cap) that I consider to be pretty typical from a network security standpoint. They focus on securing their edge-facing access points, and thus they don't allow any access to their core networks through WiFi. It's all VLAN'd off in a DMZ. An iPhone would only be useful if you could penetrate their firewall at the DMZ... but then you might as well just attack from an internet facing point.<p>This device is a lot more dangerous, as it connects to an Ethernet port. Unsecured Ethernet ports are a lot easier to come by in most businesses. I've only ever worked with one company that secured their Ethernet network at such a low level (802.1X), and they were a very, very large multi-national corporation with a big manufacturing segment. They had to secure at the Ethernet layer as a matter of certification for the products they manufacture.

At this moment this is more of a speech tax, as the speech has not yet been contained or suppressed. So you can still host speech you want free on S3 and EC2 as long as you have a plan B if some powerful speech eating weasel comes after you. This matters quite a bit in a practical sense because your pre-crisis approaches can leverage Amazon's low capital startup and recurring costs. Great so long as you don't wed yourself to approaches that only work there.<p>Of course, if we do all rely on it, it would become an even more obvious point of control and further suppress diversity in hosting as it is already doing in a major way. Diversity of hosts across jurisdictions, with diverse upstream providers is likely to provide surety that free speech will have hosts - but that suffers if we give all the unchallenged biz to Amazon.<p>I use heroku on EC2 and S3 quite a bit, and advised others to do so until this month.

The 'server' interface could just be a reduction of dependencies so that you could run it as a daemon process on a server. The Skype Network would then select it as a super node so long as the server had the right conditions (no NAT, no firewall, fat pipe, etc)<p>It presumably would still need a Skype login, but that could also be used to control it.

When the author described the ""Internet Dissent Tax,"" I don't think he's describing anything new. Controversial materials have always been more costly and challenging to publish--witness <i>Lolita</i>, which didn't find an American publisher for years.<p>Rather, the dissent tax I find more interesting is the one brought about by 4chan and company--where loosely organized groups of internet users show their general disagreement with the actions of a company by attacking their servers.<p>It seems like companies doing business on the internet who take some action that could be unpopular with some of the internet's ""defenders"" must now take into account the ""tax"" they will pay for that decision, by having to deal with the attacks that could arise. One has to think that Paypal and MasterCard will be taking this risk into consideration in the future.<p>That itself is an interesting new social dynamic that I don't think we've really seen before, since it goes well beyond boycotts or sit-ins by affecting thousands of ""regular"" users, not just the companies.",1293224689

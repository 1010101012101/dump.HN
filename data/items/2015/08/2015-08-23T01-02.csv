Second, unless you know for certain otherwise, do not assume that just because the company &quot;has some traction&quot; that they are immediately able to &quot;offer competitive salary&quot;. With that said, there is just not enough information given here to give you an answer. There is a lot to consider:<p>1. Location - salary depends on where you are located. What a software engineer in San Francisco makes compared to a software engineer in Florida are going to be two different numbers. You need to take into account your cost of living.<p>2. Benefits - what other benefits does the company offer and how good are they?<p>3. Equity - are you a gambler and willing to take a lower salary in return for more equity? On the other hand, don&#x27;t put all your eggs in one basket here. Just because you may get a large equity stake, doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the company will have a big exit and you will make millions.<p>4. Role - just because you are the first technical guy and are able to start building a team, doesn&#x27;t always guarantee that you will be the leader of that team down the road. Also, is the company bringing you on as an employee or a co-founder. While not much difference at this point probably, could play into how your employment agreement is constructed, salary, equity, benefits, etc...<p>5. Stability - are you willing to give up stability with a big company for startup life. I am not knocking startups by any means (I would never go back to big name tech company), but at the same time they are not for everyone. There is risk involved and while the prospects may sound great and you are enamored by what you read about startups, it is not all fun and games. Long hours, missed family time, unbalanced work/life, etc...<p>6. Is the company funded or are they bootstrapping? Are the founders experienced or is this their first time?",1440294261

As a graduate student major in civil engineering in China, people around me come across the firewall when they need Google Scholar, which is rare also. Sometimes they come to me for help to get access to sites like Google Scholar.

10104440,comment,10103339,10104251,0,0,a-dub,,,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a complicated, multifaceted and fun(!) problem and practical solutions  require two big pieces to come together.<p>The first is modeling.  Both the latest and greatest in process models, like Hidden Markov Models (an oldie but goodie), that learn how to predict the likelihood of the next thing in a sequence given what things we&#x27;ve seen (usually a HMM only looks at the last one we&#x27;ve seen) and acoustic models which transform audio signals in ways that accentuate the characteristics of a speech signal that are most helpful in recognizing speech.  OSS speech &quot;toolkits&quot; are often composed of the latest and greatest models of both types coming out of speech recognition literature.<p>The second is data.  Like any modeling project that makes used of supervised model training, you need labeled data and lots of it.  The labeling must be correct, and labeling speech data is an extremely tedious and costly endeavor.  This makes doing speech recognition in your garage difficult, as there is only one collaboratively constructed speech recognition data corpus that is free on the web and the quality is really not great.  (It&#x27;s unforgiving work, that must be correct and double checked.  It must be consistent.  You really need to pay for it.)<p>So, when you look around the web and you see open source ASR toolkits, what you&#x27;re really seeing is people passing around toolkits for people who develop ASRs to play with modeling.  Taking one of these toolkits and turning it into a commercial quality functioning speech recognizer requires training it on good data and validating your results.  While this could potentially be done openly and on the Internet, the costs involved in getting good labeled data has kept the production of really well functioning turnkey systems within the walls of corporate and academic entities.<p>That said, it would be pretty awesome if Google went ahead and release a giant labeled corpus to the public. : )",1440293385

I do not think that&#x27;s true, since there are infinitely many unexplored theories in which &quot;hidden variables&quot; may be at work. True, there is the Bell theorem, which says that a particular kind of theory that uses local hidden variables cannot give the same results as quantum theory. However, that&#x27;s very far from a proof that hidden variables hypothesis (which is basically the idea that quantum theory with its psi -based description isn&#x27;t the final word) is wrong.<p>What&#x27;s important for a new theory is not to reproduce all quirks of the old theory, but to explain the experiments in a better way. There may be hidden-variable theories Bell did not think about so his theorem does not apply to them, and there may also be non-local hidden variable theories that would be consistent with experiments. I hear Bohm&#x27;s mechanics is such a non-local theory whose credibility is unaffected by the Bell theorem.",1440293282

This seems reasonable to me, because I don&#x27;t see any reason why it is important to always specify the person&#x27;s gender, when I don&#x27;t need to specify who the person is, and doing so allows me to refer to someone without specifying a gender, should any situation occur where that would be useful, without anyone commenting on my word choice, because I would already be in the habit of sometimes leaving it out.",1440292227

In order to reduce the ambiguity, language designers must introduce additional rules, and additional conditions. This often includes context dependent semantics.<p>All of these things are _complications_ not just in the syntax but in the mental model. In order to effectively manipulate the code, you must hold all of those rules in your head while writing it.<p>In Lisp, the syntax requires the direct expression of context (parentheses). It also has dead simple semantics: do <i>this</i> to <i>that</i>. This means that Lisps are essentially optimized for authoring the code in the first place. This is what is meant when people say it is easy to reason about.<p>Of course, this is a trade-off, but arguably one that makes a developer more productive. Yes debugging is more difficult. Yet I&#x27;d venture it is a less common activity with Lisp as wrongness in the program is often obvious to the author.<p>But yes, not for everybody.",1440291967

If intelligence is just the ability to receive the right signals and then output the right signals to reach a certain goal, then the more inputs and outputs you have, the more intelligent you are. But then this is not how we usually think of intelligence. Intelligence is like the ability of a limited organism with limited inputs and outputs to make the most of a situation. We can already design a super intelligent system that will process inputs exactly right and output exactly right, but you need the central control and the limited body that will enable some kind of will and prioritization, and I haven&#x27;t even gotten to conscious experience yet.<p>Rather than being complex computation, intelligence is about flexibility, but it may be that due to the complex nature of our biology, all that flexibility is just a lot of inputs and outputs, in which case we&#x27;re back to square one and the limitations of the body etc. In some odd way, intelligence is quite disappointing",1440291805

2015836,comment,2015124,2015292,0,0,gjm11,,,"> I rarely buy anything [at Borders]. Why would I when I can get the same book half price [...]?<p>Because you've made use of the facilities at Borders that make them need to charge you more -- the physical store with a stock of physical books and actual staff who can help you if you can't find something or want extra information. You've derived a tangible benefit from your use of those facilities: you've found some books that interest you, and established that some others aren't worth what they cost.<p>Sure, no one is then forcing you to buy the books in Borders; neither the police nor Borders staff will give you any trouble for freeloading. And it's not actually against the law. If that's all you care about, fair enough. But it's not like there are no reasons for buying things in a bookshop when you've benefited from the things they offer and Amazon doesn't.<p>Another reason: If you find Borders useful, then you'd probably prefer them to stay in business. You might want to help with that. Again, no one's forcing you to, and you may just not care much about the tragedy-of-the-commons effect that may ensue when you and others don't. But it's a reason.<p>> Borders doesn't offer enough additional value to make me feel bad about this.<p>You can give them some but not all of the additional value by buying some but not all of those books from Borders. For instance, the ones where the price premium compared to Amazon is smaller.<p>(For the avoidance of doubt, I'm not saying ""Bricks-and-mortar good, online bad"". I buy a lot of books on line, more than I buy in physical bookshops. Amazon offers useful services that Borders doesn't -- customer reviews, the recommendation system, and so on. If you've benefited from <i>those</i>, that's a reason to buy from Amazon.)",1292582309

If you were in the store for something else and all you did is wander around to try to get ideas of what else you wanted, I don't think there's much obligation to buy. But if you're spending 15 minutes talking to a salesman about all of the possibilities (especially if you wanted to ask him the questions, as opposed to him seeing you in the area and approaching you to try to close the sale and upsell you) or extensively trying out the demo units, the store is providing you value and you're using resources that cost them money. As long as the additional markup that the store wants is fair (for an example of unfair markup see the guy who chose not to buy a $40 DVI-HDMI cable that costs <$3 on monoprice), you should compensate them for the value they provided you and buy from them.",1292580342

</code></pre>
Everything is secondary to compelling usecase. Word Lens has strange company name (QuestVisual), no logo, crappy landing page, and no PR preparation. But its darn cool! And that's what matters.<p>Assembly innovation is really cool. Every piece of Word Lens was here, but nobody made a perfect combination before today. Academic researchers will never do another Word Lens, as they are overfocused on novelty and hate just-assemble-the-pieces work.<p>Clever freemium business model. Word Lens is free, but you have to buy language packs. ""erase words"" and ""reverse words"" are free demo modes to prove that the app really works. Note, that you can even turn it into subscription model with dictionary updates.<p>BlendBack is the heart of this invention. Word Lens goes like this: (1) detect and recognize characters, (2) translate, (3) produce text in similar colors and shape and blend it back to the picture. The last step is the most innovative and can be used beyond Word Lens. E.g. one can do ""Bar Code replacer"". Turn your phone on any barcode and see some picture there. Can be used as a cheap replacement for road signs and ads.<p>No connection required. This is extremely important. 3G is unstable. WiFi is not everywhere. 4G has not really arrived yet. When you travel, your carrier can not cover you perfectly. I can see more and more essential apps that will not require connection. ""Yelp in a box"" anyone?<p>Global appeal. This is not another geek's app. It is mom and pop's app. It is an app for every country and and every village. We need to spend more time outside Silicon Valley to find needs like this one.<p>Science fiction inspiration. Part of the reason for press craziness is that Word Lens matched the science fiction story (Babel fish from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""). We love seeing SF concepts turning into reality. Let's reread old classic and implement all other concepts from there :)<p><pre><code>    What I would do next
</code></pre>
Obvious: add more language packs. Asian languages can be a bit of a challenge (recognition is harder).<p>Brainstorm pricing. A lot of options are available: different price for the first month, bundle prices for several languages, one-time price discount (a la 23andme), subscription model, enterprise package.<p>Put on hold all talks to investors and potential acquirers.<p>Immediately start working on versions for other platforms (Android, Blackberry, Nokia, WinMo). Hire another person to do just that.<p>Run a contest: iPhone for the best ""Word Lens in the wild"" video.",1292580006

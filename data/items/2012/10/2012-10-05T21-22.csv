4618862,comment,4618069,4618069,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It is sad to see an Intel engineer misstate/misuse Moore's Observation. The actual observation was that the number of transistors you could put on a chip doubled every 18 months, <i>not</i> performance. For a long time more transistors meant more performance but now that isn't the case. So people put more 'cores' on to a chip to use up those transistors.<p>That said, the ARM threat is under estimated since the power budget is so much lower and the cost per CPU is also lower. So 10,000 ARM8 cores with SHA hardware are cheaper than 10,000 x86 cores doing the calculation in software.",1349474333

But you omitted a few tasks that are not practical at all using the tools e-mail, XMPP and IRC provide:<p>Passive broadcasting / timeline: Share a status update with your friends, without putting it in an inbox or otherwise forcing them to actively dismiss it. People read your update if they happen to see it, but are not obligated to.<p>Events: Invite people to an event and let everyone see a convenient headcount and list of all the Yes/Maybe RSVPs.<p>Friends of friends: Discover new connections among the people you already knowfor example, that Bob and Sally are acquainted even though you've never seen them together.<p>Photo tagging: Label each person in a group photo in a listable, searchable way. By viewing photos others have tagged, refresh your memory of who someone is.<p>At current there is no integrated, open protocol that would solve the above use-cases in an even remotely adequate manner, even if everyone on earth used it. We're left with two options. Surrender control to centralized social networks like Facebook, who <i>have</i> solved the above problems, but only within their walled gardens. Or simply go without these benefits and opportunities.<p>Both choices are unacceptable to me, and long-term, I suspect most hackers will feel the same way.

4618841,comment,4617116,4618697,3,0,scott_s,,,"I think we have a disagreement on semantics.<p>If you can provide a guarantee based on a proof, then I do not consider that a heuristic. I consider there to be two differences between proof-based analysis and heuristic-based analysis:<p>1. Proof-based analysis <i>may</i> provide guarantees. In other words, no false-positives, but false-negatives are possible. Heuristics cannot provide guarantees, only probabilities, and they can have both false-positives and false-negatives.<p>2. Heuristic-based analysis require data to create. For example, let's say we analyzed some code and saw:<p><pre><code>  struct thing* = alloc_thing();
  process_thing(thing);
  thing = alloc_thing();
</code></pre>
A heuristic based analysis may say ""The pattern of allocations and uses in this code is consistent with known memory leaks in other applications."" That is, we have recognized a pattern in code that when seen elsewhere, there was a memory leak. This is a very different animal than proof-based analysis because it relies on historical data and pattern matching against it. But it may be a false-positive. In contrast, a proof-based analysis does not need to look at any other code but the one in question; it has <i>proven</i> what the behavior is. It could not provide a false-positive.",1349473915
4618840,comment,4616600,4616600,2,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"What I hate most about ""celebrating success"" is that it doesn't help, it just gives people envy. Success is not the goal, it's the outcome of reaching a goal, and in order to reach it, you WILL and MUST fail many times for long periods of time. Failure is inevitable and invaluable because it helps you see what does not work. Of course everyone wants to succeed eventually, but it's only through failure that we can get there.<p>It's like celebrating <i>being a good person</i> instead of celebrating the qualities that got someone to the title of <i>being a good person</i>. If you celebrate the journey more people will take it. If you celebrate the outcome it doesn't help anyone, it just gives people envy.<p>For the longest time I didn't understand that because it went against everything my parents and society taught me. As children we are conditioned to ""copy"" behaviors, actions, theologies, values, and when we don't copy them from our parents correctly we are verbally punished and our behavior is looked down on. This discourages children to be ""different"" and associates ""different, unique, new, untried"" with ""bad"". It associates ""failure"" with ""embarrassment"" And ""different, unique, new, & untried"" are exactly what one needs to get ahead in life and be your own boss, build your own company, and create something new.<p>What I learned through all these years is that Success is the outcome of trying enough things and failing enough times to find out what doesn't work and what does. Being ""afraid of failure"" means to be afraid of the ""Journey of trying"".<p>Also, when you look at governments, countries, and businesses in general, failure is the default state. Things do not automatically work, they automatically fail. And you must work very hard for long periods of time and make many adjustments before you get them out of failure and into success. Even then, that success can be temporary as markets and consumer needs change quickly.<p>One of the things I really want to do on my blog is list all my failures, websites, product prototypes, projects. Just to encourage others to do the same.",1349473880

""can I send you a [de]compressor and several compressed files whose total file size is less than the original uncompressed file and from which I can regenerate the original uncompressed file."" ""Sure""<p>Also your rejection based on the files not being compressed is not going to work.  I can get around it in only a few seconds of effort:<p>Let's say I have a theory that gzip works more efficiently when you don't have too many 1 bits in a row.  I make a script to extract all the 0xFF bytes and compress each chunk (I might have to strip headers or use a compression algorithm that's better at dealing with random data without expansion, but that's not a huge hurdle.).  Is this compression somehow not good enough?  It's definitely a meaningful transform of the original data, with the chunks coming out wildly differently.<p>In fact allowing both a decompressor and a compressed file is a bad idea in the first place.  If you get a sufficiently compact language and large file you can achieve compression on any file by the original wording. Split the data between the two files, this will give you n free bits based on where you split.  Then make your decompressor, as part of some process subjectively qualifying as 'decompression', incorporate these extra bits.<p>Mike should have simply said ""a .tar with the compressed file and decompressor, which is smaller than the original file"".",1349473791
4618836,comment,4618069,4618739,1,0,vabmit,,,"Yes. But, they look for another input that has the same hash and for which they also have other secret information. For example, a PGP public key with the same hash (Fingerprint) for which they have a valid private key thereby affording them a working ""collision"" key pair. Obviously, very difficult.<p>There are a wide array of attacks. Using the method just described and the existence of a hash collision to fake a signature, rather than a key pair, in some cases can be much easier. Depending upon the protocol and procedures used, it may also be possible to use a different method such as providing the true authorized signer with any content that shares a collision with something you'd like the authorized signer to sign (but that they would not normally sign). This can be especially true when the signing procedure is fully automated (For example, some CA's SSL certificate acquisition process is fully automated).<p>The reason that the collision is important is because many cryptosystem implementations (and humans of course) use hashes as unique identifiers of key pair material (PGP Keys & PKI certs).",1349473761

It can fail by returning {-,0,+}. However, when it succeeds, it does make guarantees. If it returns {0} for an integer, then it has proven that that integer will always and only have the value 0. Furthermore, if that integer can be 0, it is guaranteed the analysis will return a set containing 0.<p>Pragmatic analyses have no such guarantees; if a pragmatic analysis of signs returns {0}, then anything could happen.

4618830,comment,4616309,4616309,4,0,Stratoscope,,,"I bought my first ThinkPad (the classic ThinkPad 600) in 1998. I immediately decided it was wonderful and swore I'd never use another brand of computer again.<p>There was a time after that when they just kept getting better and better: the A30p with a beautiful 1600x1200 IPS display, and then that same display in the slimmed-down and faster T60p.<p>I also bought a bunch of old beaters to use as test machines and what not: 750's, 755's, a 360, and I was so happy when I tracked down a 701c with the butterfly keyboard.<p>Then for a while you could get used working A30p's in good condition for $300 or so. Did I mention the 1600x1200 IPS display? :-)<p>I love the TrackPoint [1] and those great displays, and even better, all the machines had the same great keyboard! When other laptop manufacturers were fiddling with this layout and that, every ThinkPad had the same exact keyboard, and it was a good one too. I could move from one ThinkPad to another without thinking about it.<p>Then, they hired a keyboard designer.<p>You could see the trouble coming in this poll:<p><a href=""http://blog.lenovo.com/design/keyboard-layout-survey-details-matter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.lenovo.com/design/keyboard-layout-survey-details...</a><p>The poll itself is gone, but the comments on the blog post are still there. The poll had all sorts of layout tweaks - moving various keys around in an A-B-C-D test - just the kind of thing a keyboard designer would want to do.<p>Then the new keyboards started coming along. Commonly used keys were moved around, and the F1-F2 keys were jammed into a solid tight row with no gaps between the groups of four keys. These gaps (between F4-F5 and F8-F9) are what afforded easy touch typing on these keys that are so far away from the home row.<p>Trust me, if you're reaching for Fn+F5 (wireless settings), you don't want to hit Fn+F4 (standby) by mistake. With the old keyboards, that's never a problem. There's a nice gap between F4 and F5 and you don't have to look at the keys to hit the right one. With the new one, good luck. (Oddly enough, the ThinkPad X1 and X1 Carbon <i>do</i> have little gaps here even though they follow the new layout otherwise. But the other newer models, no such luck. And the X1 keyboards are not compatible with other models.)<p>Many die-hard ThinkPad fans hated the new keyboards, not because of the ""island"" design but because of these frivolous layout changes.<p>Lenovo's response:<p><a href=""http://blog.lenovo.com/products/why-you-should-give-in-to-the-new-thinkpad-keyboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.lenovo.com/products/why-you-should-give-in-to-th...</a><p>Entrepreneurs, read the comments on that post for a lesson in how to discourage your most avid supporters. :-(<p>Edit: this comment on that post was insightful:<p>> I bet the recent supposed user tests also didn't include a significant number of dedicated, old-timer ThinkPad programmers, otherwise you'd made more of an effort mentioning this in the article, and the outcome would most likely have been different. Rather, it must have consisted mainly of random people off the street who're used to cheap laptops with keyboard layouts changing with every model. So surely they can't be bothered with yet another weird layout and thus mark it as ""fine"".<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=love+trackpoint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=love+trackpoint</a>",1349473714

4618817,comment,4617737,4618276,9,0,jlujan,,,">it's a wonderful medium for us to have shared experiences for things that otherwise would be extremely difficult to share.<p>His rant doesn't touch this because that is the perceived value to individuals that facebook provides. Cannot really argue against that and I am glad people are able to use it like this. However, there is something in this ""value"" that bothers me and why I do not use facebook. From the facebook ad link at the beginning of his post:<p>""We make the tools and services that allow people to feel human, get together, open up. Even if it's a small gesture, or a grand notion -- we wanted to express that huge range of connectivity and how we interact with each other,""<p>The ad does not show that. It shows people doing things together. It shows real people interacting in a physical world. It shows physical, tangible, things. Not pictures of things, or short quips and a link to an article or an emoticon. The feeling the ad tries to carry across to the viewer is the exact reason that facebook is a terrible medium to ""connect"" in the human sense. Lets compare it to Apple's FaceTime ad (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatSAEqNL7k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatSAEqNL7k</a>). Not only is the product in almost every scene, but the ad shows exactly how it directly integrates and impacts peoples lives. The last scene with the sign language drives home the technology empowering humans to connect in an almost surreal new way. Another example is the Kodak Carousel scene from Mad Men (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus</a>). How facebook goes from their Timeline ad (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzPEPfJHfKU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzPEPfJHfKU</a>) to ""Chairs are like Facebook"" is incredible to me. The commonality in all of these is capturing intiment moments between individuals. That is where the value proposition falls down with facebook. There is no sense of intimacy in the communication channel. A photo of your mom and dad probably has a different value to you than to your other facebook friends. It has very little to do with the photo itself as the photo has no intrinsic value either. It is the memories and emotions tied to it. That is the extent of it. Your mom doesn't need you to like the photo. Your friends don't need to see your comment saying your dad looks like a dork in that sweater. I argue that the passive nature and resulting noise to signal ratio makes facebook insufficient to build real human connections. For these things, not sure how facebook is better than email... it is no where close to live voice or video chat. Having a billion people on it means nothing when you only really want to communicate with 50 of them on a regular basis and only 1-4 of them at a time. Everything else on facebook is just self absorption and ego.<p>But I digress. His rant is really about how facebook is trying to make everything a part of its ecosystem. I can barely get older generations on email or MMS messaging let alone facebook. Trying to include facebook in every website serves no one but facebook and to what end? It definitely isn't user experience. Facebook is going the way of AOL as a ubiquitous term describing what the internet is and that is a scary thought.",1349473417

4618787,comment,4612848,4615846,1,0,waterhouse,,,"> <i>It's presumptuous to imply that one knows what someone else is thinking.</i><p>I agree and sympathize.  But incidentally, the original use of that phrase was not so presumptuous.  In case you (or anyone reading this) don't know, the original quote is from the movie ""The Princess Bride"", where one character repeatedly says that some possible event would be ""inconceivable"" and then that event happens--he also exclaims that some events that have <i>just</i> happened are ""Inconceivable!"".  Another character tells him, ""You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.""  It's ""don't think it means"", not ""doesn't mean"": this contains a proper amount of uncertainty for being a deduction about someone's likely thoughts based on observation of their actions.<p>And, as a matter of fact, cynicalkane's comment was similar: ""I don't think [thing] means what you think it means.""  Also he didn't include an adaptation of the ""You keep using that word"" part--I would have found that irritating, being an excessive use of movie references that would make nonsensical writing if the movie didn't exist--but cynicalkane's comment flows naturally, and I consider it a proper use of the phrase.  I can only assume that you have seen a bunch of other comments using the presumptuous form (if we want to be grumpy old men, we might say ""perversion"") of the quote, and cynicalkane's comment was similar enough that you thought of the other comments and decided to complain here.  (I haven't actually seen the presumptuous form myself, though I'm willing to believe you've seen it enough to be irritated--and a quick google suggests it does have a large presence.  I'd probably be annoyed too.)",1349472793

My web applications weren't so large that the port would be unreasonable, so I gritted my teeth and came out feeling like I had gained something. (Knowledge, experience, productivity.)<p>---<p>For every ""you"", however, there is someone with a non-trivial Rails 2.x codebase that simply won't invest the time or energy to port it. So they'll keep using it; keep developing libraries for it, keep patching it, etc.<p>Continue this trend, and I'd imagine you end up with something like the Python2/3 schism.<p>For an example of what this leads to, look at Rust.<p>Arch Linux uses Python 3 as the default for /usr/bin/python, Rust (0.3 and it looks like 0.4) fails to compile because LLVM can't stand Python 3. [This is described in the Rust 0.4 release notes. Of course the fix is a simple symlink and an EXPORT= away once you install Python2.]<p>So you end up with _new and exciting projects_ that require you to install and maintain old tools and libraries. Why? Because eventually _a non-negligible_ number of library maintainers stop trying to hit a moving target.<p>I'm not saying Rails will _necessarily_ go down that road; but Python has already been there, and the Python 2/3 schism isn't pretty.

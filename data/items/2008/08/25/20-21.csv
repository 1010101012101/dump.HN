I think they are a bad use case in some ways. You make good points. I think the concept is very new. This site is implemented with continuations and it works pretty well. So it's possible to have a successful site. And the current iterations have their problems, no doubt. But that doesn't mean the concept and idea is dead. It's an elegant solution from a coding standpoint - when it works. My point was that continuations could have other uses than the traditional list (backtracking,coroutines,multitasking,escape/enter recursion, etc). And if they do, then M$ is more likely to add them. M$ is not going to add continuations so that a small percentage of their developers will have an easier time implementing backtracking. But, they may very well add continuations if their web developers want them. Or if a large number of people are using IronPython or IronRuby.",1219696494

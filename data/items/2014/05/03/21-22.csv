7692480,comment,7692230,7692230,6,0,sparkie,,,"A few possible reasons I can think of:<p>* The benefits it offers over C++ are (or were) not significant enough to make people invest in the switch<p>* There were issues in the past with a poor initial standard library (Phobos 1), which led to an alternative standard library, Tango being developed - which was incompatible with Phobos, and resulted in a somewhat divided ecosystem where you had to prematurely pick one or the other. Eventually these issues were ironed out and an improved Phobos became the standard library, with Tango made compatible with it. (The damage was already done though.)<p>* Library availability lacked compared with C++ - although D could import C standard libraries it was not ABI compatible with C++, and its target audience - C++ programmers, were not going to throw away backward compatibility with all of the libraries they had already written.<p>* As you suggest, the word &quot;Garbage Collection&quot; scares some people away, despite it being optional.<p>* It&#x27;s not backed by a big name - and our industry is obsessed with big names.<p>* Perhaps a lack of literature and interest by academic institutions to teach it.<p>None of these are issues for present-day D, but I think people&#x27;s perception of the language is still affected by them.",1399154282

7692477,comment,7691019,7692211,18,0,keane,,,"That was partially my intent, so thank you! The whole thing was done in a few hours--almost exclusively research--so not saying this is a great project or anything but here are some ideas to skim.<p>The inspiration? A recent article questioned the accuracy of some the story (certainly parts are exaggerated). The article&#x27;s author, a fan of HST, believed that many placenames had likely been changed. And from that, &#x27;who knows what else&#x27;. When I found the address for the hotel mentioned, the story seemed more plausible (rightly or wrongly) and more tangible to the Derby of today. I felt these details were important context and that their inclusion could be, as you suggest, a significantly different experience. But, and I do hope this is the case, perhaps their presence could result in the reader/user being more likely to believe the author.<p>I decided sidebars, inline/side footnotes, endnotes (even in printed products) and tooltips are too distracting. The least distracting seemed to be hyperlinks in a somewhat subdued but still accessible style. (Having them hidden until interaction--like in the focus modes of some text-editors--was tempting but I wanted to avoid hover states.) Ideas from anyone on less intrusive ways of including asides are appreciated!<p>So I wanted to give context but, as TVTropes and Wikipedia demonstrate, links can lead a reader away from the primary text. Knowing this, I decided to go ahead and create a flawed experience and intentional demonstration...<p>This was the first article to be called &#x27;Gonzo&#x27;. The word was coined after its publication and so it represents the beginning of a style, widely imitated, that HST would stick with for much of his career. If this is a foundational text for the genre, what characteristics make it &#x27;gonzo&#x27;? I guess one of the main characteristics is that rather than give a detailed play-by-play of the horserace, HST instead gives details about the spectators and his own misadventures (resulting in a frank admission of unprofessionalism). These details are specific: rather than say he had a beer, its a Colt45 malt beer, just as a suspect might overcompensate with details in an interrogation with police. And he goes on to namecheck company after company (after Ian Fleming but before Tao Lin). I wondered: what would it look like if HST were drunk at the Kentucky Derby today? His namecheckings and frustrations might be expressed as at-replies on Twitter. This Gonzo post might be lost in the millions of blogs. This struck me as funny (tragic?). To allude to the odditiy of seeing a written work designed for another era and its mediums be tied and fragmented in hypertext, I linked &#x27;Hertz&#x27; to @hertz (kinda absurd, but a fairly common practice) as well as a few others like that. It does seem harder to take the words seriously as a whole when there are basic (maybe ironic?) links.<p>So I had hoped to provide context and I still think much of it is useful, but based on design limitations surrendered to the idea that this was desecrating an experience many are used to. I ultimately found it incredibly amusing to picture HST crafting hyperlinks in some bloated Soviet CMS to link to a YouTube video of teenagers signing as perhaps the HST of today is currently doing.",1399154226

If, as an individual contributor, you can&#x27;t manage yourself, I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to be good at managing others. For example... Do you take responsibility for your work or blame someone else for every problem? Do you take the initiative, or only do things when you&#x27;re told to do them? Are you good at solving problems yourself, but also capable of reaching out to others when you need help? Can you provide a reasonable estimate on how long it would take to get something done? Are you good at managing your time and do you meet deadlines? If I delegate a task to you, can I trust you to get it done and to inform me if things are not going according to plan?<p>- Communication: Can you communicate effectively with your manager and your peers on technical and business issues? If not, I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to be good at communicating with people who report to you. Can you communicate effectively with less-technical people like product managers and designers?<p>- Leadership potential: Have you done things like mentoring junior employees or proactively fixing some technical issue that needed to be fixed? Do you look for better ways of doing things? Have you voluntarily taken on increased responsibilities?<p>- Interpersonal skills: Can you get along with people, especially those whose personal characteristics are different from your own? Would I be able to bring you with me to a meeting with upper management without risking embarrassment (e.g., would you be playing with your phone while the CEO is talking)? Can I trust you to behave legally and ethically (e.g., not sexually harass other employees, have sexual relationships with your subordinates, discriminate based on race or gender or engage in bullying behavior)?<p>- Technical competence: Are you a good enough programmer that the programmers who you&#x27;d supervise could respect you and learn things from you? You wouldn&#x27;t have to know more than everyone else on your team, but your reason for wanting to manage programmers shouldn&#x27;t be that you can&#x27;t cope with programming yourself.<p>(Disclosure: I&#x27;ve been a manager and have promoted others to management roles with varying degrees of success.)",1399153751

That&#x27;s interchange plus 0.04% plus $0.10, not interchange rates without markup. &quot;Interchange plus&quot; pricing has seemingly become pretty common the past few years, at least in what&#x27;s advertised to new businesses, and now there&#x27;s a couple of ISO/MSPs offering interchange plus $0.10 flat to small businesses out there, which would be even less than those costs I quoted.<p>That &quot;boutique retail&quot; store a relative of mine opened that I mentioned in another comment -- the first MSP to walk through the door to try to sell him credit card processing offered interchange-plus pricing.

And to the extent that that isn&#x27;t <i>entirely</i> true, I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s becoming more true over time.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m biased, as I went to school and did a degree specifically in &quot;HPC&quot; back when the NSF was pouring money into the field in the mid 2000&#x27;s and pushing colleges to implement degree programs on the topic.  But my background prior to that, and what I mostly did career wise even after getting that degree, is largely focused around the Java / Open Source / Hadoop / etc. world.<p>So now I build data warehouses using Hadoop and friends, while being informed by the things I learned writing tons of MPI and OpenMP code back in the day.  And now that YARN has positioned Hadoop and a general purpose cluster framework, not tied specifically to Map/Reduce (you can implement MPI on top of YARN now), it starts to look more and more like these world really are just different aspects of the same thing.<p>Where there is a noticeable schism, to me, is the point made in TFA about how some jobs are more about IO and some are more about CPU cycles.  IOW, sometimes a job is &quot;big data&quot; because the actual <i>amount</i> of data is literally very large, but other times it&#x27;s &quot;big data&quot; (or &quot;HPC&quot;) because of the nature of the calculation being performed, even though the actual data might not be <i>that</i> big.<p>I think there will always be a place for the Beowulf type clusters and MPI-CH and OpenMP and their ilk, but I am really excited about the things that you can do in Hadoop and Friends world these days.  With the new found flexibility in Hadoop with YARN, and things like Hama (for BSP) and Storm / S4 (for streaming data), SAMOA & Mahout (machine learning / analytics), it&#x27;s a fun place to play.",1399150940

What&#x27;s wrong with offering 10Mbps service for one price and 1000Mbps service for a higher price that reasonably takes into account the capital investment that went into being able to deliver it?<p>Politics forces the terms to be ridiculous. Most U.S. cities are political battlegrounds for socioeconomic and racial conflict. Say you were trying to build fiber in Chicago. What would a private company do? They&#x27;d start in the Loop, and build along north Lake Michigan going through the dense upper middle class neighborhoods. In a city bitterly divided by racial and economic conflict, such a project would never fly. So you&#x27;d end up building infrastructure through the whole city. These &quot;build out&quot; requirements are a basic part of nearly all the terms municipalities impose on companies. Okay, once you do that, what do you charge? It doesn&#x27;t cost much less to build slow service than fast service, if you&#x27;re starting fresh with a fiber network. How much do you charge in all those poor neighborhoods the city forced you to build out to? Can you charge enough to the richer folks to recoup your capital investment in the unprofitable parts of the network, bearing in mind that the more expensive you make it, the more people will just stay with the basic tier? Especially if the basic tier is as fast as 10 Mbps, high enough for 95% of users.<p>> OK sure, all we have to do is make the incumbent ISPs stop damaging any attempt to do such a thing through lobbying and litigation. Easier said than done.<p>People lean on this trope too much. It wasn&#x27;t Comcast that tanked FIOS in Wilmington, it was the city. LA can&#x27;t get any takers for its municipal fiber project. The ISP&#x27;s weren&#x27;t able to stall Google fiber in the cities that were willing to make the requisite regulatory concessions to Google. People have this idea that companies are chomping at the bit to build fiber, and would but for ISP and cable lobbying. This is a fantasy. Companies aren&#x27;t building fiber because there isn&#x27;t enough money in it under existing regulatory regimes.<p>> If Comcast can turn a large profit then there is no reason a municipal ISP couldn&#x27;t break even without consuming any tax dollars. Pay for the initial roll out with a bond issue and then repay the bond over time from subscription fees.<p>The states and cities are totally bankrupt. Their credit ratings are in the shitter, and almost all are facing unclosable budget gaps due to pension and healthcare obligations. Limited funds are available just to keel core infrastructure, like bridges, from crumbling. Issuing hundreds of millions in bonds for fiber is utterly untenable.<p>Not to mention, as shitty as Comcast&#x27;s service is, do you want your municipality as your ISP? Most can&#x27;t even get busses to run on time, and only manage to supply power and water because that infrastructure was built before their governments became broken.",1399150908

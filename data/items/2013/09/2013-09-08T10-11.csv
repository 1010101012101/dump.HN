Theoretically abusing the concept, wouldn&#x27;t you just use something Brainfuck based if you found a nice way to describe your hardware using some BF based software and DSL? Most attributes of programming languages that we software guys care about seem irrelevant at this level, so Haskell or C or Lisp, why would it matter?",1378637715

6348388,comment,6346531,6347890,2,0,tytso,,,"Um, so you realize that the BEAST attack is pretty TLS (and heck, pretty implementation specific --- it only works against certain websockets implementation).   That&#x27;s because it is a chosen-plaintext attack, so it is dependent on TLS being used to encrypt Javascript, where the Javascript libraries are hosted on a server under the attacker&#x27;s control.<p>Also, remember in the early 90&#x27;s, when IPSEC was still going through its indeterminable standardization process, this was  pre-AES, and most of us were still using DES (or if we could afford the CPU --- CPU&#x27;s were much slower back then) 3DES.  Heck, some of this work was going on before Javascript was even invented!   :-)<p>BTW, I was wrong, the comments about not using a counter did make it into an RFC.  See RFC 2405, which does state that using a counter or some other low-hamming distance is preferred.<p>Note that there are dangers with using a random IV --- if you do this, the RNG used to generate your IV&#x27;s had better be independent of the RNG used to generate your session keys, or else you might potentially leak information about your RNG state that might be yet another wedge into attacking the crypto.  (In particular, I would NOT recommend using RDRAND in bare fashion --- see comments on my G+ post #ThinkLikeTheNSA --- about what fun and games you might have if you could compromise the RDRAND instructuction.)<p>If you really want to be paranoid, generate a separate key (different from the key used for encryption and for generation of the MAC) and use that key as the basis of a Cyptographic RNG, and then use the output of that CRNG for your IV.",1378637259

6348371,comment,6347557,6347557,20,0,m4x,,,"Her final statement (and in particular her final word) resonated quite strongly with me. It&#x27;s hard to know where the point of no return is on this issue but I suspect that when it comes (and goes) it will be without fanfare.<p>It seems fairly clear at this point that as a race we&#x27;re facing some fairly substantial problems that need to be addressed if we want to avoid major catastrophe, and yet almost without exception the people I speak to about these issues are dismissive and unwilling to make even minor changes to their lives. Nobody is willing to accept responsibility for the problems and everybody believes they will somehow be resolved without their personal intervention. Even as somebody who is genuinely concerned and willing to accept responsibility, there seems to be nothing of worth that I can actually do to help.<p>The scariest part is that we can well and truly pass the point of no return before we even realise there&#x27;s a problem to be addressed. This is true for practically all the environmental issues we are facing. By the time we realise how much we&#x27;ve upset a system and that awareness propagates down to a significant proportion of the world&#x27;s population, the damage is done and we can&#x27;t do anything to fix it. Some people do notice earlier, and some of those people will jump up and down about it, but nothing real can change until a significant proportion of the population is staring down the Gun Barrel of Consequences. And so we just keep charging towards the bluff.<p>Her use of the word &#x27;adapt&#x27; is quite prescient. Things are going to change; we have so much momentum at this point that it is unavoidable. And as it happens we will just have to ride it out as best we can. The thing that makes me saddest now is not that I might personally suffer (although that certainly used to worry me) but rather that we are going to destroy a lot that is quite beautiful, and once it&#x27;s gone we cannot bring it back. But life will go on, and one day the world will probably be beautiful again.",1378636296

It doesn&#x27;t really change the way you think about the program, but in PHP it leads to stuff like variable variables (`$$myvarname`) and to assigning a string &quot;foo&quot; to `$x` and having `$x(...)` execute as `foo(...)` and so on... which is cool and useful sometimes, but <i>this really messes up a beginner&#x27;s mind</i> or it leads to code that is almost impossible for beginners to read, comprehend and learn from.<p>Perl at least had the &quot;if it&#x27;s different, it should look different&quot; philosophy as a justification for its sigils. PHP just makes functions and variables look different and it feels like CLs two namespace system with `foo(...)` / `(foo ...)` and `$foo` / `(funcall foo ...)` being different, but it was mostly useless in CL too and it has the same side effect of adding extra cognitive overhead to passing functions around, which imho should be <i>as simple and natural for a beginner as possible</i> to ensure that later on he has a safe landing in functional programming land...",1378636174

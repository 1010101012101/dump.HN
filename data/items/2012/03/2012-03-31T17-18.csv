3780984,comment,3780254,3780299,1,0,tensafefrogs,,,"Totally agree. While there are obviously some differences, I think blaming technology (i.e. Facebook) for horrible things that humans do is just silly. The problem is not that Facebook is making it easier for people to do bad things, the problem is that people do bad things.<p>The technology is here to stay. Information will be shared more easily in the coming years and it will only get easier to categorize people in the future based on their behaviors. So maybe instead of complaining about ""bad companies"" taking advantage of this, we should be encouraging people to be more accepting of differences. The problem isn't that a girl checked into a local bar. The problem is that someone wants to stalk/rape her. Scaring people into not checking in to somewhere (or not doing so publicly) is getting dangerously close to saying ""well, she shouldn't have worn that short skirt if she didn't want to get hassled"", which is a terribly flawed argument and ignores the actual problem.<p>There's an entire side of this that is overlooked whenever this debate pops up: All the freaks and geeks who thought they were alone because they were into different things can now find like minded people and know that don't have to feel alone. Look at the ""it gets better"" campaign. It's beautiful and has likely helped thousands of people. We should focus on the good stuff a little more often rather than focus on the potential bad stuff.",1333216155

3780855,comment,3779735,3779735,3,0,mikepmalai,,,"Best tips I learned:<p>1. Call / email for price quotes - The biggest dealers (due to much higher volume/scale) tend to have no problem quoting you a price over the phone.  Those that can't compete on price, tend to tell you to come to the dealer for a quote. If a dealer doesn't give you a price over the phone, ask them if they would like a call back once you have a price quote in hand so they have an opportunity to counter.<p>2. Be flexible - Don't preemptively narrow down the inventory available to you with specific features/colors. Get price quotes for the make/model you're interested in first and then start asking about feature/color/service differences, etc.<p>3. Set a tight timeline - I'll usually call around in the morning and tell dealers up front I'm going to buy this afternoon. I tend to get the most competitive quotes this way and it gives the dealer an opportunity to quote a price based on the inventory on hand rather than a general quote.<p>4. Get counter offers - Once you have a set of price quotes, call the dealers again and get counter offers for your best quote. Some big dealers are so confident in their offer they'll encourage you to call around and see if anyone can match it. You WANT dealers to start dropping out and saying they can't meet that price. If everyone counters your lowest quote, that price quote was too high.<p>I've learned that dealers usually know which competitor in their area offers the best price...you just have to spend a little time wringing that out.",1333214325

I have my doubts...<p>While I use the Win7 backup system on my WS it does make me feel a bit uneasy, I feel I have no control over it whatsoever. It doesn't do incremental backups. I have no say in how long they should be stored, the backups are stored in a weird way with hundreds of zip-files and I've found no easy way to browse them or restore just a lost file and I haven't even dared to use the restore options because I feel like I'm going to blow something up (so maybe you can do that, but the UI is just <i>bad</i>). Also I get no report that a backup was successful or if it has failed and I can't tell it to delete <i>old</i> backups).<p>I've used Acronis True Image before and I really wanted to like it but...\nI used it to, among other things, back up some network drives. All was fine and I got confirmation that everything was fine every week, but one day I skimmed through the logs and found out that the network drives hadn't been backed up but Acronis still said that the whole operation was a success. I can't even begin to comprehend the absolute lunacy about ignoring some failures in a backup program. Maybe they've fixed this now but they have a long way to restore my trust.<p>Also when doing incremental backups you can not anywhere state that I wan't a complete backup after x incremental backups. You have to manually move the old backups to force it to do a complete backup again, and it won't delete backups older than x months/years so you have to manually clean up or else your backups will constantly increase for all eternity. This should be about the third or fourth feature you implement in a backup program and all it would take is like 10 lines of code and a checkbox.<p>So, still having a hard time to see how one couldn't be better than Acronis I stumbled upon EaseUS Todo Backup Workstation but you can't do incremental backups of your OS (seriously?), so I've resorted to doing incremental partition images but I'm mighty unimpressed by the GUI and I don't feel safe at all.<p>Seriously guys, this shouldn't be hard! I just want incremental backups of my OS (but a complete backup after x incremental backups and auto-delete after say 2 years), easy to do a complete restore or just browse old files and a working reporting system (even mail will be enough, just don't say everything is fine when it isn't). I can't imagine something being more simple than those basic needs and I've yet to find anything decent.<p>It would be nice to be able to take a daily backup for the last x days and then only keep one for every week for y weeks and then only keep one for every month for z months but I have completely given up my hope of finding something ""advanced"" enough to handle something like that.",1333213919

The article gives you a pretty good indication of why but, nonetheless, two different dealers lost my potential business by basically refusing to deal with me except by making an appointment at the dealership.<p>I did end up dealing with a third dealership in person but only after confirming the availability of a model shown with a price in their Internet inventory. The in-person process was still a bit icky but I knew I was getting a good price on the car. I just deflected all attempts to play the monthly payment game. And they ended up giving me a good enough price on my trade-in that it wasn't worth additional fussing with.<p>Know the facts. Know what you're willing/able to pay.

The entire app itself along with user-generated content depends on a few large (highly variable) objects sent as JSON where the DOM is manipulated based on this minified data.<p>As a bit of a backup measure (mainly to prevent XSS), the client-side javascript sanitizes (which is what I believe you partly mean by data validation) all objects sent to the client when as they receive it.  So anyone using the intended client-side script should never be susceptible to XSS.<p>But if by ""data validation"" you were referring to concepts like whether or not a user has permission to access/modify some part of the database, of course that is checked server-side.",1333213371

By default, most Linux distributions behave like Windows and OSX, so folks like me who never used Unix workstations have no way of knowing they're missing out on what I consider one of the key advantages of the Linux desktop.

Ironically, three years after falling in love with focus-follows-mouse because of Yegge's frustration with OSX, I joined a company that is all OSX on the desktop.  Le sigh....",1333213349

What I see is a pattern of overwhelming desire to throw away code just as it's in danger of becoming useful to actual users.<p>Phrased from a different angle, the reason we wanted monthly releases was not because monthly releases are interesting in and of themselves, but because they could deliver regular (if incremental) improvements to actual users on a predictable schedule.<p>Forking Rakudo into an all-but-abandoned master branch and doing monthly releases off of that branch hews to the letter of the idea of monthly releases while violating the spirit of those releases. I understand the reasons why it happened, but that sort of decision has happened often enough in the project that it's a habit--if not culture.",1333213333

Comments are also critical for future-safety against ""fixes"" that ""look right"" but will actually break the code.<p>I tend to have a ""60-second rule"". If it took 60 seconds for me to figure this out, then I should comment. For example, I commented the need for a curried function signature in Utils.mergeMaps because it wasn't at all obvious, and I kept getting type errors till I got it right.<p>Personally, I think the worst thing about what I have right now is that it really deserves to be split into more than one file, but I'm delaying the build system question (I dislike Maven, SBT seems neat has a bad reputation) for a little white.",1333213287

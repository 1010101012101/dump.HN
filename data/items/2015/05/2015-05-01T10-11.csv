I have asked a few people opposed to drugs why they were opposed to drugs and their answers were mostly health related i.e. Cannabis gives you psychosis so you shouldn’t smoke it. I then ask if, hypothetically, there was a drug developed which produces intense happiness for one hour but had no side effects, caused no long term damage and was totally benign, would it be morally acceptable for a person to take that substance, the answer is usually a firm no.

9470521,comment,9469783,9470350,0,0,tyho,,,"Heroin is one of the most harmful drugs to the user[1]. Its usage should not be encouraged by anybody, but heroin should absolutely be legal, heavily regulated, but legal. The VAST majority of heroin related deaths are just that, related to heroin but not caused by it.<p>Heroin is actually a remarkably safe drug in a clinical context, it does almost no long term damage. The main problems with it are that it is highly addictive, users rapidly develop a very high tolerance and it is fatal in overdose. Heroin overdose is very easy to treat, there is a antidote to heroin called Naloxone. If administered in time, it will almost certainly save the life of somebody who is overdosing on heroin.<p>People who use heroin die because they share needles and contract diseases such as HIV/AIDS. People who use heroin die because they do not use clean needles and get sepsis when they inject. People who use heroin die because they do not have pure heroin.<p>Heroin can be cut with both active and inactive substances. Some of the inactive substances used are toxic, they make accurate dosing, which is critical to using a drug with such a low ratio between fatal dose and active dose safely. Active cuts such as Fentanyl are equally dangerous[2], they make it impossible for the user to accurately dose.<p>I am not calling for heroin to be sold in super markets or off licences. What I am suggesting however is that for anybody who wants it, they can go to some sort of health center, be lectured about the harms, taught how to inject properly and how to administer Naloxone in an overdose situation and then be given a licence to buy heroin. The heroin would then be dispensed by pharmacies, it would come with an adequate supply of needles, Naloxone. Most importantly the heroin would be pure and unadulterated, in solution already.<p>There is now a much lower risk of overdose as it is far easier for a user to dose themselves. The heroin does not come with dangerous cuts. They will have an adequate supply of needles so there will be less needle sharing and less infectious disease[3].<p>The obvious argument against this radical approach is that it would increase heroin usage. There is no precedent for this kind of program so I cannot refute that claim with any certainty. From intuition however, I do not think there are many people where the only thing holding them back from using the drug is the current prohibition. I have not met a single person who has said &quot;If heroin was legal I might start doing it&quot;. What I do know is under our current system of prohibition heroin usage has increased, deaths associated from it our sky-rocketing in recent years and the politicians current answer to the crises is harsher punishment for users and dealers despite that in the past, heavier punishments do not correlate with either lower use or less deaths. It is time to try something radically different, I would love to see a trial of this sort of system somewhere in the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sg.unimaas.nl/_OLD/oudelezingen/dddsd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sg.unimaas.nl/_OLD/oudelezingen/dddsd.pdf</a>

You&#x27;ve got pigs, spices, and a stove.<p>If you&#x27;re in Germany, there&#x27;s no problem -- kill some pigs, grind some pork, mix in the spices, and cook your meatballs. You could make sausages the same way (as long as you&#x27;ve got tubing). And you&#x27;re free to sample your food as you cook it to make sure it suits your tastes.<p>If you&#x27;re in the US, you&#x27;ve got two options:<p>1. Give up on sausage entirely. Make sure your ground pork is well cooked before you even think of eating any of it.<p>2. Carefully vet the pigs for trichinosis before introducing their pork into your kitchen.<p>Unsurprisingly, we use option 1.<p>Germany, like the rest of Europe, has opted for a blanket solution where they&#x27;re not allowed to have pigs with trichinosis. The US has opted for a different blanket solution where you can&#x27;t eat raw pork. Nobody is suggesting that we carefully inspect individual pigs and treat the meat according to whether they had trichinosis.",1430477208

So, don&#x27;t dismiss parent comment so easily.<p>My issues with the parent comment are not that addicts never steal, it&#x27;s the ignorance of lumping all drug use into the same category and then saying &#x27;drugs&#x27; make you steal.<p>It&#x27;s the same in the UK - addicts of one sort or another do disproportionately make up the crime figures. However the proportion of drug users who are addicts is small and the proportion of addicts that steal is small so saying that drugs and theft go hand in hand is just plain wrong.<p>>> yes, alcohol comes hand in hand with theft and other crimes.<p>Again, a tiny proportion of drinkers may cause a problem, this is not the same as saying they go hand in hand, implying anyone who has a drink is going to get addicted and steal stuff to support their habit.<p>>> it&#x27;s victimless short term, but if it&#x27;s hard drugs addict, there will be victims sooner or later.

Now schools can do something about that to some extent - my kid&#x27;s school fosters relationships across the ages of children present in the school, one of its better ambitions IMO.<p>Bullying is an interesting issue; there are bullies in the world and at a sub-criminal level there&#x27;s often nowhere to go to fix your interactions with them other than your own resourcefulness, something which can be usefully informed, I feel, by bad experiences in school.<p>Of course just being educated otherwise than at school doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t be bullied, just not in school!",1430476584

I.e., which commits conceptually belong together and with a quick descriptor of what their purpose and/or who their primary author is (or whatever else your chosen policy for naming them is).<p>That branches are not the only refs that keep commits alive is irrelevant, because the other refs by themselves are not sufficient; not every commit is reachable from a tag and reflog entries expire. Branches remain a necessary ingredient.<p>Git needs this because it requires a named head for each commit because (1) it has a garbage collector and (2) it doesn&#x27;t allow for multiple checkouts. In version control systems with multiple checkouts, a new branch will typically end up in a checkout of its own. Because there&#x27;s no GC, it will not spontaneously disappear, and because each checkout keeps track of its own head, there&#x27;s no need to name it. Git branches are an artifact of Git&#x27;s odd architectural choices.<p>But my bigger point is not about wanting to keep something alive that isn&#x27;t part of the history, but that branches may not always accurately reflect what&#x27;s part of the history (because Git allows you to alter them, and that&#x27;s often even part of the normal workflow, e.g. deleting a temporary branch once you don&#x27;t need it anymore). This usually does reflect human error, but, well, a major point of using a VCS is to protect against the results of human error. If you messed up your branches, then you can lose data either because (1) it eventually gets garbage-collected [1] or (2) it doesn&#x27;t get pushed anymore and some day your computer or hard drive breaks. This is what I meant by Git introducing fragility.<p>[1] Yes, once the grace period expires and it disappears from the reflog, but that only makes it less likely, not impossible, especially for stuff that sees only intermittent work.",1430476166

It spawned a lot of organizing to fix problems without begging elites. Nor did they decide to become another Tea Party (flunkies to billionaires/politicians). Once they decided to do that, the state and corporate media decided it was an enemy, not a tool. Hence endlessly repeated talking points about how it &quot;discredited itself&quot;.",1430474782

Exactly the same scenario played out then as is, hopefully, coming to it&#x27;s inevitable conclusion now in the &#x27;western hemisphere&#x27;. If the same thing is starting up again in the East, it&#x27;s going to be a bloody and chaotic few decades to come before the same lesson gets learned the third time over.<p>Fortunately we do have a largely successful, bloodless war on a drug to learn from. Tobacco abuse is less than half what it was back in the early 70s in the US, and similar declines are seen in many European countries. Advertising campaigns, usage restrictions in public places and high taxes have been very effective, and also meant that the medical costs of treating the effects of tobacco abuse have been more than covered by tax revenues from it&#x27;s sale in many countries.<p>While campaigns against alcohol abuse have not been as successful, mainly because they have not been as focused on reducing all usage, tax revenues have been high. Normalisation of low levels of use in appropriate circumstances and ammounts have also limited the harmful effects on most abusers and those around them.",1430474778

The riots are often peaceful protests gone awry, and this has happened over the course of various civil rights movement(s).<p>> The only thing that riots do, in my view, is give a more negative view/stereotype of the class in question - I wouldn&#x27;t say they are a step forward, but a step backward.<p>This assumes the reaction to the riots is a stereotype and not people trying to empathize or understand where it&#x27;s coming from. While there may be some like you who seem to react in the former, journalists and bloggers (and even this discussion! thanks for engaging) are doing their best to make the outcome the latter.<p>> As for #6, yes, the cost of incarceration is a problem as well, but rioting is not fixing that problem in any way, only making it worse (by putting more people in prison).<p>Actually rioting is in response to the problem in hopes it&#x27;ll change, so in the long term making it better.

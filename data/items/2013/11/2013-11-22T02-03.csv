6778976,comment,6775797,6776594,9,0,kabdib,,,"I worked in a hybrid environment at Apple (we had this office / common area setup in Infinite Loop). It was a great working environment, and I got a lot done. You could leave your door open and join in the conversation, or close your door and shut out the world for a while.<p>I work in an open space plan at Valve now, and it&#x27;s pretty decent. The thing that makes it decent is that desks are mobile; there is no assigned space (want an office? find an empty one and move in) so you can very easily choose who to work next to. This cuts down a great deal on interruptions caused by people interrupting the people /next/ to you, which I found was the actual source of randomization in most cubical environments.<p>Also, stuffing more than a few dozen people into a shared area is probably bad. Don&#x27;t do that.",1385089159

Won&#x27;t hurt you.<p>It is possible to consume 10,000 calories of carbs in a day. Short of physically stuffing it in, you will find it effectively impossible to eat 10,000 calories of fat and protein. You&#x27;ll probably find it a challenge to go beyond 3,000. (Though if you switch to a high-fat, high-protein diet you might manage in the first couple of days before your body adjusts fully. And I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re average; a large man might get 4K, but again, that&#x27;ll be a challenge.)<p>Calories are not fungible. And once you accept <i>that</i>, it&#x27;s frankly hard to look at the evidence, the biochemistry and how the hormones work, and not end up fingering carbs as the source of the obesity epidemic, not fat.<p>You may find it interesting to note that carbs all come from plants.

Many people have grown up with that butter is unhealthy and vegetable oils or cereal are healthy.<p>Also if you eat lots of carbohydrates you&#x27;re more likely to feel hunger and loss of blood sugar every two hours, and you eat more. When you eat mostly plants, meat and fat, you feel satisfied longer and don&#x27;t eat extra snacks, calories or other things, which makes eating sane amounts of food and calories easier.<p>I don&#x27;t think the obesity or health problems are completely going away by changing the macronutrient ratio but probably anything is better than high-carb & low-fat advice.

6778831,comment,6778397,6778689,2,0,Silhouette,,,"I&#x27;ve been looking into this possibility myself, as we&#x27;re currently upgrading our home entertainment systems and I was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of alternatives to &quot;smart&quot; TVs.<p>Unfortunately, typical home or SOHO Internet and wireless set-ups tend not to support something like shoving all your AV equipment on a separate VLAN when it hits a wireless router. Ideally, you&#x27;d probably want either direct access from that router to the Internet, isolated from your main network, or if you&#x27;ve got a slightly more advanced set-up, the ability to set up a static route that will only allow traffic from the AV part of your network to your Internet router, again fully isolated from your main network. Sadly, playing with VLANs tends to need a step up to a more serious level of networking equipment and in particular routing hardware, and the price for that is prohibitive at present.<p>It would certainly be interesting to see some advances in basic routing coming down into the home/SOHO markets, though, and potentially developments of consumer-friendly hardware firewalls as well. As homes become increasingly networked and automated, I suspect there is going to be a growing market for dealing with these kinds of security issues but with minimal set-up and as few different items of networking equipment as possible.",1385086417

(not kidding, they announced it during the demo).   The French guys were followed around during the entire hackathon by a salesforce camera crew (I was sitting right next to them, some of the salesforce people even came over to help them submit to be sure they got it in before the last 5 min was up, kinda knew they were in from day 1).  One of the finalist teams didn&#x27;t make the check-in time, so they extended the check-in by a few hours (saw that one coming too).  And last but not least, the healthcare app.  Although I liked the app, it was way too polished given the team size, and the time allotted (I mean wow, very professional if it were true), but the fact that they were using lots of logos (with trademark) of some big insurance companies in their demo and video (specifically in the rules, unless of course all those big companies gave written consent in the 3 weeks), kinda figured they were getting a leg up.  The bluetooth app, that one I thought had value, and was innovative (albeit not realistic in facial recognition).  I would have voted for that one if I could.<p>You could tell it was just a dog and pony show on the 2nd day.  Some people were helped, some werent.  Then, when you submitted, all you got was a &quot;sorry, your not chosen&quot; -dear john- canned email...  Nothing telling you where you could have improved, nothing saying what your score was, no information at all.  Just a simple &#x27;sorry&#x27;....<p>Turned out to be a huge waste of time, energy, and money.  Wont be coming back, that&#x27;s for sure.&quot;",1385085701

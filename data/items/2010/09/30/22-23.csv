A number of Python templaters (like yours), lisp templates, and other language templates have a system like yours, nested lists.  But they quickly become unworkable, lack the ability to do if statements (simple branching), and not having to put end tags (""))"") is half the reason you use Python!<p>Python's whitespace proves to make a much better language for templates than any other.<p>My ""success"" may look enviable, but it's luck. Except not quite luck.  When I visited California, I wrote a script to email over 200 companies.  Only a few replied. Is that luck, or did I make that?",1285887585

That's how words are; we can't use the dictionary as a sort of rulebook and demand that people follow every definition carefully. Language changes, it shifts, and those shifts are dictated by usage, not by some immanent set of required forms.<p>I confess that I've had to admit this to myself with some reluctance. Those of us who are technically inclined, and who value precision and accuracy, can never <i>really</i> get used to the fact that language is a muddy and changing thing, and that there are no real 'rules' of usage; people can use words however they'd like. Like a lot of geeks, I've always had a bad habit of constantly stopping people when they use phrases like 'it begs the question...' or 'it's ironic...' in nonstandard ways. However, linguistic prescriptivism isn't really coherent as an approach to the world, I think, and life is smoother when I just let go and accept that I'll generally understand what people mean even when they say that it's 'ironic' that they've missed the train three days in a row.",1285885892

1745132,comment,1744213,1744213,0,0,frisco,,,"Dropping out of college is often seen as a marker of huge success and drive.  In reality, it's just one path you can pick when answering the question, ""given this dream, how can I maximize my chances of realizing it?""<p>This is a little more subtle than it sounds.  I left school after my sophomore year and went on to raise a $1 million Series A from a blue-chip VC.  A year and a half later, I ended up back at University not in defeat, but in realization that for my specific ambition there was more I could get out of the university.  I wouldn't call myself a student -- I'll always be a student in that I'll be learning my whole life -- but I have as specific a reason for being at the institution as I did for dropping out.  Traditional ""students"" are those who are in school without a better reason for why they're there.<p>There are a lot of potential businesses where it makes sense to be affiliated with a university right now.  There are also a lot where the right move is to stop out and move immediately to SV.  You <i>could</i> drop out and still start a biotech company -- but you'll most likely end up net-negative, spending 6 years quietly hacking away on very limited resources on the fringes before breaking through.  You <i>could</i> start a spaceflight company without a degree, but you're taking the hardest possible route to get there.  If you're smart enough to do that, you're smart enough to figure out how to do the minimum possible work to get by in your classes, and spend the rest of your time talking the university into giving you access to resources (and credibility) you'd never have otherwise.  It's not about the degree: it's about what you can get out of the university while disguised as a student.<p>It's definitely easier now than ever before for great hackers to do well without a degree.  And you can certainly get rich down a lot of those paths.  But the really cool companies -- space travel, clean energy, biotech, and so on -- can use the university for a lot for a few years in order to advance the same goals before breaking off on your own.  The two more years I have access to subjects with <i>chips implanted in their brains</i> and <i>tens of millions of dollars of cutting-edge equipment</i> is a springboard for any subsequent activities, however inane classes might be.  The opportunities are there if you go and take them.",1285885508

One aspect of a ""standard"" is uniform interfaces or one-size-fits-all, an essential aspect of which is that it doesn't suit all needs perfectly. It's a modular approach, that involves adapting non-quite circular circles and non-quite triangular triangles to perfectly square slots. You see it in mathematics and (eg) OO polymorphism all the time. It's an unpleasant but often worthwhile tradeoff.<p>But at the edges, that tradeoff becomes questionable.

There are many complex issues in the NoSQL/RDB comparison, since both have adapted to the detailed problems of their respective domains.

We built reports, data warehouses, dashboards, etc.  From my experience, the article is spot on, not linkbait.<p>Maybe MongoDB is better once you have a well defined query that you need, but I think the point of the parent comment is that those examples of queries are ad-hoc. NoSQL is not as good as SQL when it comes to report specs that are constantly in a state of flux.<p>I need my data available to answer questions.  When building a product you have a well defined set of operations based on the features of your product. When the requirements shift on a regular basis, NoSQL is too limiting.<p>When the article talks about a low level query language being too limiting, they are talking about missing things like CONNECT BY PRIOR or SUM(CASE IF col IN ('a','b','c') THEN 1 ELSE 0).  These are the same kinds of things that are difficult to do with an ORM.",1285884086

I personally am looking at who the next guys is going to be. Node looks promising but it is hard to tell. I used to think ""sure Java is aging. but there is no huge motivator to move off, its not going anywhere"".<p>Now with each move by Oracle, I am forming the opinion that Oracle is bound and determined to kill it. I don't know what they are thinking, do they think that the Java developers will just go, oh well now Oracle is the only vendor we will get or stuff from oracle? No they will bail, I don't know how they could ever think that it would turn out any other way.<p>I am dumbfounded by the course of action that they are taking.

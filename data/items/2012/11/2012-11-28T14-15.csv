But this procedure has nothing to do with whether or not it runs under, say, VmWare or not. It has anything to do with does this particular disk volume supports FS snapshoting.<p>The next question is - what use of that snapshot when your system crashes and you got lost all the changes made since the last snapshot? <i>How a VMWare helps you here?</i><p>Now consider what a bottleneck naively virtualized (represented as a file in a host system) disk volumes become, when I/O operations on, say, your DB's physical (transaction) log got interfered by I/O operations of your syslog daemon, or whatever other activity is going on.<p>In a database world the solution is about decoupling, partitioning and avoiding any I/O sharing possible.

4842793,comment,4841887,4842586,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is the sort of question that keeps NASA scientists up at nights. It's a fundamentally tough problem to tackle, especially with just a rover full of instruments and experiments. You can try to design the experiment such that you can show that it's the presence of external samples which show signs of biological activity and not the parts of the machinery itself (e.g. comparing results with and without an external sample present, comparing different samples, etc.) but even that isn't foolproof.<p>Keep in mind that for unmanned ""life detection"" missions a spacecraft would not just be constructed in a clean-room but all of its components (as well as the whole vehicle) would be extensively sterilized (at 112 deg. C for about 30 hours, for example). Additionally, the vehicle would be extensively swabbed throughout assembly to search for any amount of biological contamination.<p>However, more than likely the focus will not be on an unmanned life detection mission but rather on a sample return mission (which would be optimized to try to find samples containing life) or on a manned mission (which would also likely entail sample return). In either case there would be a considerable amount of research resources available to study any samples of Martian life, should it be found, and bring to bear instruments or tests which would unambiguously show it to be of a different origin to Earth life.",1354114705

That means you can scratch regular steel with glass and vice versa, with some difficulty.  (Try it. I just did.)  Brass (your key) is around 3 or 4, so it won't scratch glass.<p>There are lots of things with Mohs hardness above 5.5, including most common metals (except brass, aluminum, copper) and most rocks.<p>Sand is almost never made up of glass particles.

Certainly my fingers weren't designed to type, yet there it goes.  The other side of such a fallacy would be akin to stating that because I can type with my fingers, they must have been ""designed"" (intelligently?) to type.  So abstractly, I have to agree (since it was posed in an abstract variable replaceable way).<p>In this case, however, since the scientists know what they'd need to ""prove"" life, they can state that Curiosity doesn't have enough sensor capability to gather such evidence.  Rather than stating that Curiosity was not designed to detect life, it would be more appropriate to state that Curiosity is incapable of providing rigorous proof of life.<p>Now, back to the evidence.  Stating that what Curiosity has found is not evidence, may be taken at face value only if we narrow the definition of ""whatever Curiosity has found"" to the information capable of being gathered and returned, as opposed to the sources of the exhibits under observation (which may or may not have a biological origin, or may or may not be a precursor to biologic functions).  A thin metaphysical/epistemological distinction to be sure, but one that is relevant because when we need to trust our senses, we need to know our sensor limits, and when we need to trust remote sensors, extra-terrestrial remoteness is as remote as it gets, and its hard limits cannot be easily overcome once deployed.",1354114121

Consider a few examples of famous derivative works: Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, Alice in Wonderland, Apocalypse Now, Muppet Christmas Carol. Right now there are no less than 3 different ongoing adaptations of Sherlock Holmes (the movie series, the BBC series, and CBS's Elementary series).<p>These are works that would be patently illegal if the source material were not in the public domain. This isn't just about ""remix culture"", it's about being able to adapt and interpret what's out there, fully and without restriction. Clearly there is value to allowing such artistic freedom once a work has grown sufficiently old. However, today that age has grown quite impractically long. A movie such as War of the Worlds (a 110+ year old book) can be made without seeking a licensing agreement, but movies such as The Hobbit (a 75 year old book), King Kong (79 years), The Chronicles of Narnia (62 years), Casino Royale (59 years), or The Dark Knight Rises (73 years) still require licensing.<p>And the sad part is that even in the next 20 years when, say, the Superman IP will be pushing 100 years old and Mickey Mouse even older it seems likely that such things will still require licensing.<p>The fact that the current IP laws have not utterly destroyed creativity or the productivity of creative industries is not a ringing endorsement.

IMHO, they're treating the symptom anyway, the problem is that a large number of road users in the UK (including quite a few cyclists) are aggressive, discourteous or just plain bad drivers/riders.<p>Cycle facilities (cycle lanes - dedicated or not, off road cycle paths, advanced stop line boxes, etc) all help encourage people to cycle; this is great as the more people on bikes on the road the safer it is for everyone (see TFL's ""Safety In Numbers"" campaigns). But a 2mm high strip of white paint on the road isn't going to save me from an idiot that is texting whilst driving and not looking where they're going. Ideally we wouldn't need any on-road cycling provisions at all.<p>I've ridden a bike quite a bit in France and have had no problem with the car drivers there, they give plenty of space when overtaking and have no problems being temporarily held up behind a cyclist until it is safe to overtake. No special facilities, just courteous drivers.<p>Segregation works both ways. This is anecdotal, but on one long distance ride in the UK there were sections where the riders were overtaken by the support vehicles of other riders (mainly the european riders). By far the worst (in terms of least distance given when passing) for overtaking were the cars with ""NL"" markings on their european number plates. My guess is that the years of segregation have put them out of practice with sharing the roads with cycles. Again, that's just my experience.<p>FWIW I cycle commute almost daily in London (I took the train today as I've got a horrible cold) and have grown used to London traffic. The closest times I've come to an accident were all my own fault. I've read ""Roadcraft"", I've had a full driving license (both car and motorcycle) for 15+ years, I did do cycling proficiency at school, yet I'll still take the opportunity for more training if it comes up (the local London boroughs to me often provide free cycle training every so often). I don't undertake vehicles approaching left turns, or overtake vehicles approaching right turns. I avoid cycling in the 'door zone' and I'm especially careful passing stopped cabs as the doors are invariably opened by passengers without looking. I'll be assertive but not aggressive. I smile at the lemming pedestrians that walk a step or two out into the road before looking. etc.",1354112865

Yet we have met no one.""<p>Sorry mate, but it's not reasonable to think that at all. The galaxy is colossal.

A cyclist in a fluorescent jacket is going to be visible to me in the mirror or through the window on the final check because of their height.  And if I'm pulling out a fluorescent jacket also helps because I am looking at around body height (at cars and pedestrians).",1354112339

The advantages are so many that in fact it should be the default go-to option when provisioning a server (even a single-purpose one).<p>Many if not most of the production servers on the web run some sort of virtualization; Xen alone powers EC2, Rackspace, Linode, Rimuhosting and many others. In my experience it only adds about 3% of CPU overhead as a disadvantage.",1354111480

However, there's an overhead in running a headless browser, of memory, CPU, time, and bandwidth, so it might cost substantially more.<p>You don't need a browser for everything, but working out which pages need a headless browser and which you can get away with scraping sounds like an interesting problem.",1354111477

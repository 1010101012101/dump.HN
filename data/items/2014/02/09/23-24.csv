Though I will say that, though that might make it legal to use without permission, I myself don&#x27;t necessarily think that it <i>should</i> be legal even were it changed to an extreme degree. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;d have to think about further and would surely require a case-by-case analysis.<p>That being said, I do think most sampling that I am aware of would not be transformative. In general -- and maybe this could even be a good theoretical legal test, though it&#x27;s not for me to decide -- if I listen to an original song, and then a newer one which samples the original, and recognize the sample, then I wouldn&#x27;t consider it transformative.<p>> This is why a search engine company can produce a thumbnail of a page without running afoul of copyright law.<p>I don&#x27;t know the legal implications of this, but that is surely a very different situation than sampling music. The thumbnail is to give users a quick preview of what to expect when they click into the page. A reused sample is doing just that -- being literally reused in the same way it was used originally except in someone else&#x27;s work. Surely this disparity of use must have some legal meaning, as I do feel it surely has moral meaning.<p>> It&#x27;s also how commercial parody can (though not necessarily) be done without a license from the original author.<p>Indeed, but again I don&#x27;t think I necessarily see how that applies to a reused sample in any case except where the new song actually parodies the original (which certainly does happen on occasion, with Weird Al being an obvious example).<p>> It&#x27;s also why a judge recently decided that Google&#x27;s book scanning system, which does not have copyright permission from the owners, is sufficiently transformative without reducing the primary market that it is legal under fair use.<p>I&#x27;d argue that plenty of sampling does indeed reduce the market for the original. Plenty of people seek out a song because they&#x27;ve heard it somewhere and now that &quot;catchy tune&quot; is in their heads. The &quot;catchy tune&quot; gives it economic value, which is being essentially stolen when someone samples without permission.<p>The Kanye West / Daft Punk / Edwin Birdsong example that I gave elsewhere in this thread exemplifies that. I&#x27;m sure that plenty of Kanye West fans who might have bought or otherwise sought out (thinking more of exposure through ads / radio than piracy here) Daft Punk&#x27;s original wouldn&#x27;t bother or need to since Kanye&#x27;s version is essentially Daft Punk&#x27;s with some rap verses thrown in. That catchy hook is the same in both. EDIT: to be clear, assuming Kanye / Daft Punk obtained the necessary rights I of course have no problem with these songs existing.<p>> Not everything which is valuable has government-granted monopoly rights. The US does not accept &quot;sweat-of-the-brow&quot; as a basis for copyright, which is why databases cannot be copyright, even if the database itself is valuable.<p>That is a good point, though I think the combination of a sample being both copyrightable and valuable is a potent argument to those who would say that a misappropriation of a sample is just a &quot;small-potatoes&quot; or irrelevant infraction, legally or ethically. So I suppose I wasn&#x27;t arguing entirely on the basis of law with that statement.",1391988948

I had a haven, a place where no one cared what I looked like, what my body was like or about any ephemera—they cared about what I could do—and this culture shift has robbed me of my haven. At least I had that haven. The girls who follow me missed out on it.<p>Well, yes. Computing and programming has become (more) mainstream -- it&#x27;s no longer a tiny sub-culture free of mainstream bias. I&#x27;m sure there are disappointed skaters, surfers and punks out there too.<p>I don&#x27;t think the best way forward is to throw out years of feminist research, or think that &quot;if we could all just get along like before, the problem would go away&quot;. It&#x27;s not that it wouldn&#x27;t go away, it&#x27;s just that we need to make an effort to get there. One way to do that is to have sex-segregated introduction classes. They shouldn&#x27;t <i>all</i> be segregated, nor is it the only thing that we should be doing -- but that is <i>one</i> way of creating a safe and rewarding environment. If we have tutors managing to get mixed classes going, in a way that works well, then that&#x27;s great too (see VonGuard&#x27;s comment for example). Generally if you can grab kids before they&#x27;ve been hammered into groupthink about toys, fun and gender roles (which is harder and harder to do with increasing tv commercials, product placement etc) -- then kids don&#x27;t need to be &quot;de-programmed&quot; -- they can just be allowed to be kids. And they&#x27;ll play and learn by themselves. But the later you start, the more likely you&#x27;ll need to have a plan of attack if you want everyone to get a fair shake, and similar participation.<p>I do think she&#x27;s right in calling out a lot of the crap that people do in the name of &quot;political correctness&quot; -- without much thought about how or why, though. Being righteous isn&#x27;t enough; if you&#x27;re not <i>right</i>, you&#x27;re probably just making things worse.<p>[edit: I don&#x27;t usually comment down-votes -- but I&#x27;d like to see a comment.

The key point is that Bluetouff made an important admission, apparently during his 30 hours of &quot;garde à vue&quot;, meaning, being under arrest at the police station, where he seemingly neglected to apply his right to remain silent: he recognized that, when going up the folder hierarchy, he landed on a username-password login page. From this, according to the court, he should have inferred that the documents were private and that he had nothing to do there. Instead, he spent several hours siphoning the documents <i>afterwards</i>, which established his intent to remain in the system despite having found out that he wasn&#x27;t supposed to.<p>One can then discuss whether this law is fair or not, whether things would have been different had Bluetouff not made this key admission, whether it is reasonable to consider that the login page was sufficient to indicate that the documents weren&#x27;t intended to be public, and whether the 3000 EUR fine is balanced or not.<p>Meanwhile, Bluetouff has appealed the ruling to the Cour de cassation, France&#x27;s last-resort court for civil and criminal cases, whose role is to break rulings where the law was not correctly applied (without discussing the findings, only the application of the law and the adequate forms). I do not think we know yet how Bluetouff will phrase his appeal, but Eolas estimates that there would be a possible way to attack the ruling based on the court&#x27;s finding that Bluetouff&#x27;s retrieving the documents constitutes &quot;vol&quot; (theft) though it does not fall within the scope of the formal definition of theft (because the ANSES was not deprived of the files).",1391988870

I avoided languages like Java and C# because they had so much syntactic &quot;noise&quot;., because they were statically typed, and because they were clearly inferior languages.<p>And Lisp...well, I shuddered at the thought of learning Lisp because of all those parentheses.<p>Now, however, I don&#x27;t give a damn about braces.  I use Java if the job calls for it, and I&#x27;ve developed quite an appreciation for C#.  I enjoy playing around with Lisp and recognize that it shares a lot of fundamental features with Python.  I have a strong appreciation for C&#x27;s power and control (but use it only under very certain circumstances and with great trepidation).<p>Python is still my go-to language because of its incredible ecosystem, but I no longer insist on using it for everything.

We could say that the true quality of the game was unknown in stage 1.<p>My personal opinion is that the vast majority of content created languishes in the equivalent of stage 1 for its particular ecosystem. Of this content, the vast majority will be garbage, a small minority will be reasonable and a tiny minority will have the potential to be a widespread hit. But of this last group, most or all of it will never emerge from stage 1 because stage 1 does not provide it with enough attention to separate it from the rest of the (bad) stage 1 content.<p>Increasingly I think that the journey to stage 1 to stage 3 is the most important, most difficult and most overlooked part of the progression.<p>For example, when something is submitted to HN, from my anecdotal observation it will typically get something like 5-10 simultaneous visitors from the new page. If it gets a minimum critical mass of votes to hit the front page, this will increase immediately to something like 50-100 simultaneous viewers and increase from there. But often, it only takes 3-5 upvotes for it to hit the front page. So the relatively trivial actions of the small critical mass of early consumers has an extraordinarily large effect on the dissemination of the content. Indeed, as a content creator, it&#x27;s often struck me that the actions of those first 3-5 people have an equivalent significance, in terms of the world&#x27;s experience of my content, to me as the creator.<p>And if you create good content, then just getting to the front page is by far the most difficult part of the process, because once there you will naturally attract upvotes from the vastly increased exposure. But with only a few random bits of cosmic entropy set differently, the creator could create exactly the same content, fail to get those first 3-5 votes, and the number of views on the article/app/etc. could be 10 rather than 10,000 or 100,000.<p>In my experience, lots of platforms follow the same model. Reddit is a very obvious one, but the same holds to for trying to get press interest: so much depends upon the decisions of a few key journalists, and that decision may depend on how many other emails hit their inbox that hour, or whether or not they&#x27;ve had their coffee yet, or some other particle of background entropy. This isn&#x27;t a criticism of the press, it&#x27;s just a consequence of the current system. The same is true for people who run influential blogs or social media accounts with large followings, or newsletters.<p>The problem is that there is less attention available per item of content than the minimum quantity of attention needed to rate the quality of that content well. When I create something new, my worry is never &quot;Boy, I hope that people don&#x27;t simply  dislike this,&quot; it&#x27;s always &quot;Boy, I hope that enough people see this to give it a shot of achieving its potential, whatever that turns out to be.&quot; If it turns out people don&#x27;t like it, which is of course always a possibility, that&#x27;s fairly easy to handle. If it disappears into obscurity, that&#x27;s much more difficult to accept.<p>When I create content now, my promotion strategy is 99% focused on that first stage. If it reaches that critical mass of attention among a small number of early, influential people, I feel like my job is done and the chips should fall as they may. If it reaches that initial critical mass, people will <i>want</i> to write press stories about it and post it on social media and ask for interviews and tell their friends about it, assuming its any good. This may be an obvious conclusion, but the interesting part, for me, is that the initial critical mass is much smaller, much more random and much more difficult to achieve than most people realize.",1391988289

Currently, I run an EdTech company that I co-founded 3 yrs ago. My partner & I work ~25 hours/wk on the company & have a few employees. Our profits are growing & we’re working on new products that should provide additional growth. As it stands, the company wouldn&#x27;t be able to support us full-time but we are hoping it’ll be able to when we graduate. With this option, I would work full-time for my company.<p>2. Given the company isn’t at a place where it can support us, I&#x27;d find a job in industry (ideally at a startup).<p>3. Attend grad school to get my MS in CS. This can be broken down into 2 types of schools:<p>a. My current school has an accelerated master’s program where in an extra yr (for little cost) I’d come out w/ my ME in CS. The school&#x27;s program is average (just inside Top100).<p>b. Attend a high-caliber school like GTech (Top10). This program would take 2 yrs & cost ~$45k (if no scholarships or aid). However, it has a larger range of classes including ones focused on Web/Mobile Dev, EdTech, data viz & UI design (all interests of mine). I could also seek stronger internships in Atlanta than where I currently live.<p>After grad school, I’d work for my company or search for a job.

I contemplated compiling to assembly and eyeballing it, but a few sessions with the profiler got me the answers I needed.

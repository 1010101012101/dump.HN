As a stop-gap - here's a list of talk titles from 2010.  Not all of these made it - we had 50 x 5 minute talks, and some of these didn't make the cut:<p><a href=""http://www.mathsjam.com/MathsJamTalksOffered_2010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathsjam.com/MathsJamTalksOffered_2010.html</a><p>But the talks and puzzles were really a starting point.  The main purpose was to get people together to talk about what they are interested in.  The talks only accounted for 60% of the time, the rest was in coffee breaks where people talked about maths at <i>all</i> levels.  We had PhDs talking about their latest difficulties, and industrial mathematicians talking about the applications of the latest results from various areas to their work.  We had teachers finding new ways to present concepts, and we had retired people lending their expertise and thoughts to students.<p>And there were puzzles, demonstrations, magic, and other stuff that geeky people like.",1311681514

The eye, for example, evolved separately many times.<p>BTW, in human engineering the first solution is also often kept. Look at nuclear power. We probably should be using the thorium cycle, but we kept light water reactors because they were the first big reactor commercialized (for military reasons). Another example would be x86 architecture. I am not arguing that evolution is magical in any way, just that human engineering doesn't show signs of being much better in many cases.<p>I see a lot of engineers who are ignorant of biology claiming that ""evolution is slow"" and that we should be able to snap our fingers and do better. It's a popular point of view among the singularity crowd.<p>Engineers are trained to be arrogant about their abilities.

2806922,comment,2806873,2806873,1,0,hugh3,,,"I think the present emphasis on prisons as solely a form of rehabilitation is misguided. Prisons should be primarily about punishment.<p>What do I mean by that? Well, the urge to get revenge is an extremely strong part of the human psyche. We really <i>want</i> to see that those who wrong us wind up suffering for what they do. If someone wrongs us, our first instinct on the caveman level is to go over to his house and kill him.<p>Now, all this private killing tends to cause major problems in society if everybody is trying to individually punish everyone who wrongs 'em, so we outsource the whole ""revenge"" thing to the government, who sets up a criminal justice system to determine who <i>actually</i> deserves to be punished and then punishes them. You steal my bike, you go to prison and suffer, my bloodlust is satisfied, everything is cool. I don't have to kill you, which means your brother doesn't have to kill me, which means my brother doesn't have to kill him, and society is a much better place.<p>Now, in order for all this to work, we need the ""revenge is bad and uncivilized"" meme. This is the meme that discourages us from taking private revenge against people and tells us we should really just take it to the police. And that's fine and dandy, except some people seem to have generalized this from ""private revenge is bad"" to ""all revenge is bad"", and have started claiming that the justice system shouldn't be about revenge or punishment either.<p>I've gone on a bit already, but my main point is that the primary goal of the criminal justice system should be the satisfaction of the natural revenge-desire of crime victims, not necessarily the absolute minimization of the crime rate.<p>edit: Also, surely there's some fundamentally funky statistics going on with the ""lowest reoffending rate"" thing? Presumably prisoners are not assigned to this prison at random -- only the least problematic prisoners are allowed to go there.",1311681213

2806899,comment,2806155,2806739,4,0,JohnLBevan,,,"With regards to the retirement problem, that's only an issue because people are still thinking like mortals.  Were we immortal I'd expect gap years to replace retirement.  Many people would choose to live their lives in cycles, retraining every 50 years for a new job / change of scene, getting to a proficient level, then taking a break for a few years until ready (or out of funds) to retrain & start anew.  Once they'd done a few cycles people would likely begin to specialise, picking up stuff they'd touched on in the past & taking it to the next level / mixing it with their other skills.  The issues then arising are the capacity of the mind (mind rather than human brain since who knows what form it will have taken by this point).
I've assumed that with immortality we maintain physical (if still relevant) and mental fitness, as without those, extending life becomes torturous and pointless, causing people not only to not enjoy their lives, but also to become long suffering burdens on their families, just for the sake of a larger number of sun circuits.",1311680791

Just the data. - pure Value Objects, classes which are little more than wrappers to data, which can be assembled in more complex structures for presentation by a view.<p>The Domain Model. A representation of the data, the actors, and the processes. The objects are often a mix of pure value objects, object managers, actors that carry out actions on multiple data items, and facades/processes that coordinate several actors, maintain their own state (internal model/statemachine or externally in other objects).<p>The ""Framework Supported"" Model (for want of a better term). This is where the data model has some aspects of the domain model, but a number of pieces are defined outside of the ""model"" and in a framework. Bits that are often separated are things like: <i>validation</i>, keeping track of sessions (actor state), collecting multiple models together for presentation to a view (maybe typically done in a facade), dependency injection, lazy loading, etc.<p>Personally, if a framework has clean and clear support for things that I'd usually put in a Domain Model, I'm probably going to use it. Especially for input validation!! They usually end up in the ""controller"" for lack of a better place to put them. However, sometimes it makes sense to pull it into your model... especially where you may have multiple controllers/processes acting on the same data - and leaving it to the framework controller is going to be an issue.<p>I'm not a fan of ""views"" pushing data back to the models without the controller... unless you're doing your validation and access controls, etc. in the domain model then it's a slippery slope.

2806812,comment,2800538,2804839,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"PL/I and C are not from the 1950s:<p>PL/I was designed in IBM by a committee headed by George Radin in about 1963.  First versions were running by 1966.  Version 4 was running by 1969 and quite clean.  There have been later versions.  By the time IBM slowed maintaining the language, it was polished.  Finally there was just one guy in CA maintaining PL/I.  I suggested adding AVL trees (see Knuth, TACP).<p>The main intention of PL/I was to serve people using any or all of Cobol, Fortran, and assembler (at least for applications programming).<p>Again, versions of PL/I have been used for system programming in at least Multics and Primos.<p>It has been noted that the 1960s were ""the golden age of programming language design"".  In comparison, progress for the next several decades was disappointing.<p>C was designed at Bell Labs in the 1970s.  Likely the designers of C knew PL/I if only because they borrowed the semi-colon to end a statement and the syntax of comments.<p>C was supposed to be a minimal language, as simple as possible, to work on an 8 K DEC machine.  The clever part of C was that while it had so little, with pointers, structures, malloc, and free, it still had enough for system programming.  Also, since C was so simple, it needed no 'run-time' and could be used in embedded code in read only memory.<p>C++ was just a pre-processor to C to formalize some of the then standard ways to use C to make it livable for more complicated applications programming.<p>So, PL/I started off with much more than C. Since neither PL/I nor C can or will change, PL/I is still far ahead of C.<p>The preprocessor C++ is a bit ugly.  Tough to say that just from a pre-processor C++ is much better than PL/I.<p>So, net, when Google asked me what my favorite programming language was, I said PL/I instead of the answer they wanted, C++.<p>I did not say that PL/I was the ultimate programming language, the end of programming language design, a programming language for 10,000 machines with 10 processors each with 1000 cores, etc.  I didn't say that people should convert to PL/I.  But, then, I would feel sorry for anyone to start a new project with C or C++.<p>I had my fling with programming language design with KnowledgeTool and a subsequent project.  At the time I looked at the literature of programming language design and was not impressed.  To me the literature looked like it was just rehashing old ideas back to Algol, looked like 'research' in cooking that was just remixing Escoffier's collection of sauces.<p>If since then the design of programming languages, compilers, operating systems, etc. have made progress, then about time and good.<p>For what is 'practical' now, I've voted with my feet:  At present, I'm concentrating on my project in applications programming and am using essentially just Visual Basic .NET, ADO.NET for getting to SQL Server, ASP.NET for Web pages, and .NET for some of the other functionality it has, e.g., a lot in time and date manipulation.<p>That Microsoft went for their common language runtime (CLR), 'managed code', 'garbage collection' (with memory 'compactification'), common 'intermediate language', invited others to write their own syntactic sugar on top of the these, and provided the syntactic sugar C# and Visual Basic strikes me as good for now.<p>For my project, I decided to stand on Microsoft Windows instead of flavors of Unix.  On Microsoft, I went with Visual Basic (VB) .NET.  So far Windows and VB .NET have been as promised.  I miss some of the features of PL/I, but the missing features don't keep me from getting my work done.<p>The VB .NET complier has been terrific:  It compiles my programs in time in practice for me equivalent to 0 seconds.  I will never type in enough code to slow down that compiler.  The error messages, including in the context of ASP.NET, have been quite nice.  I've found no bugs at all.  The compiler has been easy to use just from command lines driven by some simple ObjectRexx scripts.  I'm thrilled.<p>The main problem I have in my software development is some of Microsoft's documentation:  (1) It is horrendous, thousands of Web pages, and, thus, tough to work with, even when it is good.  (2) For SQL Server, especially management and administration, especially the 'security model', and a lot more in Windows, the documentation was awful in ways that have cost me unbelievable time and effort:  Things didn't work anything like promised; I had to mount side projects to diagnose the problems and work around them; I had to write my own documentation, develop my own scripts to lock in the solutions, etc. to get around the nonsense and get back to my work, etc.  It was horrendously expensive.<p>But, just for a programming language that is practical for applications programming now, I selected VB .NET.  I certainly didn't try to continue with PL/I.<p>All this started just because Google asked me what my favorite programming language was and I said PL/I instead of C++ like they wanted.  My answer was fine.  The HR-recruiter rube didn't see PL/I on their list of acceptable answers and ended the interview.  That was Google's error, not mine.",1311678610

I can back this disk up 5 times to my 400gig external hard disk (full disk image each time) .. to do a backup I boot from the external disk, which has a minimal OSX install on it just for this purpose, then I make a full disk image, save it, and reboot.<p>Do this every week, and you're set ..",1311678373

He seriously seems to believe that Symbian in its current state is up there with Android, iOS and Windows Phone:<p><i>You the reader may think that Symbian was a dead OS, it was undesirable, it was failing in the market, it was obsolete etc. That all may have been true of the older versions of Symbian, up to September 2010. It is not true now. The facts are irrefutable. From October 2010, Nokia had an honest hit OS that powered increasing sales, increasing ASPs and most importantly for Nokia - dramatically increased profits! Only a complete fool would step on this incredible success, and kill it.</i><p>He thinks the Nokia N8 is a great phone. It isn't. I had it for 5 months until I gave up and switched to a Samsung device (after 10 years with Nokia).<p>Symbian^3 on the N8 didn't deliver half of what was promised. Horribly broken web browser, no portrait keyboard, unusable app store that spent two minutes downloading updates for itself whenever it was opened, outdated version of the Qt API on the device... The list goes on.<p>Nokia said last year that there would be quick updates to Symbian to fill in the missing functionality. Rumors said that a revamped browser would be available by the end of 2010. Then Nokia officially extended this deadline to Q1/11. Guess what? The new browser still isn't available for the N8. The update, now called Symbian Anna, may be available to N8 users next month, if they're lucky and their operator approves of the OS update...<p>This lethargic pace of development makes it clear that Symbian development was out of control and the whole OS is unsalvageable. They had thousands of engineers working on this system, but it had grown so complex that they apparently couldn't even update the browser without breaking everything, leaving the OS stuck with a 5-year old branch of WebKit.<p>Nokia never understood software. Giving it up and letting Microsoft have total control of the user-facing operating system is the best thing they could have done.",1311678208

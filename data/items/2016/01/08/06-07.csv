You merely pointed out there is a tiny amount of &quot;western&quot; companies operating in China, with no numbers on the ratio of foreign to local operations. Which would be the real way to refute that point.<p>There are foreign brands sniffing around the edges.  But mostly, Chinese spend their money IN china.  The car companies are a good counter example, but that&#x27;s mainly because China didn&#x27;t have the Car manufacturing expertise in house, I believe this is changing.  McDonalds and KFC are a joke in China for every one of them you see, there will be at least 10 chinese fast food competitors with more customers.

I assert that downvotes more often correlate with disagreement than failure to abide by the standards of discourse. Since the penalty is limited, that&#x27;s okay.<p>A comment can have far worse consequences than the loss of a few karma points. If you say the wrong thing, your reputation and (potentially) your livelihood are at risk. That&#x27;s why, for anything <i>remotely</i> controversial, I use pseudonymous accounts. It&#x27;s simply not worth it to have my real-world reputation ruined. I can&#x27;t imagine the deluge of hate that would descend upon me if some of my views were known; doubly-so for misconstrued versions of them. I can already hear the haters: &quot;Chroma approves of torture!&quot;[1][2], &quot;Chroma is sexist!&quot;[3][4], &quot;Chroma is ageist!&quot;[5] &quot;Chroma hates muslims!&quot;[6][7], &quot;Chroma hates the Amish!&quot;[8], &quot;Chroma hates pilots!&quot;[9], &quot;Chroma wants to slaughter all lions!&quot;[10], &quot;Chroma thinks motorcycle riders are mentally ill!&quot;[11] Etcetera.<p>That said, I agree with you on defensive writing. When expressing anything controversial, defensive writing is mostly a waste of effort. Simply holding the opinion is cause enough for others to downvote and denigrate. Unless it&#x27;s something very close to your audience&#x27;s views, you might as well aim for good prose and avoid hedges.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10531577"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10531577</a><p>2. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8725500"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8725500</a><p>3. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10443021"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10443021</a><p>4. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4321440"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4321440</a><p>5. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8889897"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8889897</a><p>6. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9530853"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9530853</a><p>7. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8879389"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8879389</a><p>8. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9280711"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9280711</a><p>9. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10417447"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10417447</a><p>10. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10476699"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10476699</a><p>11. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8569078"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8569078</a>",1452236073

I get more and more tired of the lazy stream of anti-capitalist sentiment leaking into HN as though all the worlds problems stem from capitalism.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a fair chunk of my career working in the Middle east or with Middle eastern companies and my wife is Chinese so we have strong connections over there as well. Both have highly centralised, statist systems with heavily restrictions on their economic markets. If you haven&#x27;t actually been there and lived under non-capitalist systems you have absolutely no idea just how utterly corrupting and venal they can get. It&#x27;s suffocating, and it&#x27;s insidious tentacles work their way into every facet of life.<p>It&#x27;s true that there is corruption in the west. Big corporations do have too much influence on politics. There are problems with the way wealth is becoming concentrated. But the issues we face pale into comparison to the problem in countries that don&#x27;t have free markets. In the west we have the 1%, but in non-capitalist states it&#x27;s more like the 0.1%. It&#x27;s the difference between systems run according to the rule of law which have some corruption, versus systems run by corruption which have some laws. Capitalism is built on the principles of property rights and economic freedom. It turns out taking those away from people isn&#x27;t a good thing after all.",1452236015

10863368,comment,10843680,10844009,0,0,mjgeddes,,,"Bayesianism is a &#x27;grand unified theory of reasoning&#x27; that all of science be should be based on assigning (and updating) probabilities for a list of possible outcomes; the probabilities are supposed to indicate your subjective degree of confidence that a given outcome will occur.<p>Contrast this with an alternative conception of rationality as espoused by David Deutsch.<p>David Deutsch in his superb books, &#x27;The Fabric Of Theory&#x27; and &#x27;The Beginning Of Infinity&#x27;, argued for a different theory of reasoning than Bayesianism. Deutsch (correctly in my view) pointed out that real science is not based on probabilistic predictions, but on explanations. So real science is better thought of as the growth or integration of knowledge, rather than probability calculations.<p>So what&#x27;s wrong with Bayesianism?<p>Probability theory was designed for reasoning about external observations - sensory data. (for example, &quot;a coin has a 50% chance of coming up heads&quot;). In terms of predicting things in the external world, it works very well.<p>Where it breaks down is when you try to apply it to reasoning about your own internal thought processes. It was never intended to do this. As statistician Andrew Gelman correctly points out, it is simply invalid to try to assign probabilities to mathematical statements or theories, for instance.<p>Can an alternative mathematical framework be developed, one more in keeping with the ideas of David Deutsch and the coherence theory of knowledge?<p>I believe the answer is yes, and I am going to sketch the basic ideas for such a framework.<p>The basic idea is to separate out levels of abstraction when reasoning (or equivalently, levels of recursion).  In my proposed framework, there are 3 levels, and each level gets its own measure of &#x27;truth-value&#x27;.  All reasoning must terminate in a Boolean truth value (True/False) at the base level but the idea is that different forms of reasoning correspond to different levels of abstraction.<p>1st level: Boolean logic (True/False)<p>2nd level: Probability value (0-1)<p>3rd level: \nConceptual coherence (categorization measure)<p>For full reflection, you need <i>three</i> different numbers:  a Boolean value (T/F) at the base, a probability value (0-1) at the next level of abstraction, and an entirely new measure called <i>conceptual coherence</i> at the highest of abstraction.<p>As a rough working definition of <i>conceptual coherence</i>, I would define it thusly;<p>&quot;The degree to which a concept coheres with (integrates with) the overall world-model.&quot;<p>It should now be clear what&#x27;s wrong with Bayesianism!  It only gets us to the 2nd level abstraction!  There is not just uncertainty about our own knowledge of the world (probability), there is another meta-level of uncertainly; uncertainty about our own reasoning processes, or logical uncertainty.  Bayesianism can&#x27;t help us here.  Conceptual coherence can.  Lets see how:<p>All statements of the form:<p>‘outcome x has probability y’<p>can be converted into statements about conceptual coherence, simply by redefining ‘x’ as a concept in a world-model. Then the\ncorrect form of logical expression is:<p>‘concept x has coherence value y’.<p>The idea is that probability values are just special cases of coherence (the notion of coherence is more general than the notion of probabilities).<p>To conclude, conceptual coherence is the degree with which a concept is integrated with the rest of your world-model, and I think it accurately captures in mathematical terms the ideas that Deutsch was trying express, and is a more powerful method of reasoning than Bayesianism.",1452235974

Same situation with Stripe.<p>From the perspective of a Paypal or Stripe, letting someone accepting credit cards is very similar to extending someone a loan. In the early days of Paypal, fraud almost killed them several times. I&#x27;ve been involved in a smaller credit card processing business and fraud almost killed us a few times.<p>In the current system in the US, legit merchants ends up getting beat up the most, and taking the most liability, in exchange for the convenience of accepting plastic.<p>If someone uses a stolen credit card to purchase goods online or in person, it&#x27;s their, and they have to pay. And often lose the items sold too.<p>If the Paypals can&#x27;t pay, then the upstream banks have to pay. Of course this would never happen, so the upstream banks never have to pay. Their risk is totally covered along the chain; so they don&#x27;t really care THAT much about fraud.<p>Meanwhile, the end users of credit cards enjoy pretty good liability protection, and get paid in miles and cash rewards.

There are so many potentially catastrophic threats that the addition of &quot;intelligence&quot; to any of them seems totally superfluous. Numbers are so much more dangerous than intelligence: the Nazis are more dangerous than Einstein; a billion zombies obliterate humanity; a trillion superbugs are not much more dangerous if they are intelligent or even super-intelligent; we intelligent humans are very successful for a mammal, but we&#x27;re far from being the most successful (by any measure) species on Earth.<p>This fixation on intelligence seems very much like a power fantasy of intelligent people who really <i>want</i> to believe that super-intelligence implies super-power. Maybe it does, but there are things more powerful -- and more dangerous -- than intelligence. This power fantasy also helps cast a strong  sense of irrational bias over the discussion. This power fantasy is palpable and easily observed when you read internet forums discussing the dangers of AI. This strong psychological bias tends to distract us from less-intelligent, though possibly more dangerous, threats. It is perhaps ironic, yet very predictable, that the people currently discussing the subject with the greatest fervor are the least qualified to do so objectively. It is not much different from poor Christians discussing how the meek are the ones who shall inherit the earth.

Even if strong AI is achieved next year, we are still at a point when we know absolutely nothing about it, or at least nothing that is relevant for an informed conversation about the nature of its threat or how to best avoid it.

We are already seeing negative examples of self-reinforcing bias when it comes women and minorities (and positive bias towards hegemonic groups), which is indeed a terrible danger. Yet, this is already happening and people still don&#x27;t talk much about it.

I worked with neural networks almost twenty years ago, and they haven&#x27;t changed much since; they still don&#x27;t work at all like our brain, and we still know next to nothing about how a worm&#x27;s brain works, let alone ours.",1452233889

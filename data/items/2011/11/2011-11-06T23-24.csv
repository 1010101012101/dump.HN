A physical overlay requiring precise positioning will destroy the fluid experience of the iPad which makes it so great.<p>For instance when I'm typing a lot of text on my iPad I still often alternate between reading and writing. If I leave the overlay on when switching to read a blog post the very bottom of the page would always be obscured. It looks like trying to read through the plastic keys would be annoying at best and impossible at worst. On the other hand taking the overlay on and off would be a nuisance since you would need to get it into the exact right spot every time you wanted to start using it.<p>Instead if people want to type quickly on their iPad: Practice! Here is the typing test leaderboard for an app I made called TapTyping:<p><a href=""http://www.flairify.com/leaderboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flairify.com/leaderboard/</a><p>The fastest typists have reached over 110 wpm with 98% accuracy (which is frickin' insane, BTW) but even speeds half of that are quite functional.

I have seen people attempt to do this and they have managed to a certain point but then it becomes problematic, even on small scales with 100 sites producing $1 each/ day and have eventually merged them all into one since, it is far easier to manage 1 bigger site/app.<p>However, if you are really determined to build 10 apps that produce $10 each/day then there are loads of ways of doing this but, it depends which route you would rather go down i.e. FREE apps which are monetized with ads & even in-app purchases or PAID apps which can also be monetized with in-app purchases.<p>Likewise, you should have a look at PhoneGap - <a href=""http://phonegap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phonegap.com/</a> with regards to a framework etc since, you can build and easily deploy your app to multiple platforms (increasing your revenue streams) since it would be easier for you to launch your existing apps onto Android, Windows Platform and BlackBerry's etc.<p>Again, without knowing your existing apps, I can't really say if you should solely focus on scaling these up to producing more revenue and expanding them or launching a ""bigger"" type of app which can make $100+ per day since, whilst I have highlighted in my opinion that it is easier to have one core focus there are also certain aspects which can limit their expansion strategies.",1320623213

When people are ""freed up to do far more powerful and interesting things"", does this result in <i>paid work</i> at the same rate as the freeing-up happens? Or will there be significant lags where, say, 20-30% of the population might be unable to earn income at any given time? And how long-lasting will that be? Also, to the extent that automation running on robots and computers is what produces advances that humans could perhaps symbiotically work with, will everyone have access to the same starting point (software/hardware/etc.) so they can do so, or will there be a rich-get-richer feedback loop where the tools of automation are mainly in the hands of the better-off part of the population?<p>I don't really have a guess myself.

They would never have bought a phone in that state but are more than willing to transform it into that state having bought it.<p>>  It's awesome because of how much it can do across use cases.<p>I'm not sure I'd agree with that.  The iPad is exactly good because it does a number of specific use cases extremely well but it is not really good at generalizing from those.  In many ways Apple has gone out of their way to stop that.<p>Eg: if you really do a lot of typing and have to have a tablet, I'd think something like an ASUS Transformer is a better device, not just because it has a keyboard but because the whole ecosystem is better for that (eg: the device has a file system shared between apps, you get a mouse cursor, happily accepts external media, etc.).  It was meant to be used in a huge number of different ways not anticipated by its makers.  But it does not do the things that the iPad is meant for as well as the iPad does.",1320621397

Girls don't like guys that approach them and rattle off about how funny they are, how much money they make, and what a great lover they are. Girls respect guys who are confident and layered, not guys who throw all their cards on the table in a 30 second pitch in a desperate attempt to be liked. Bartenders will first serve patient, confident, respectful customers, not eager, aggressive douchebags flashing twenties and snapping fingers.<p>Not being a super-experienced investor or fundraiser, I'll leave the translation to investment pitches up to others, but I have a mixed reaction to this post. For most people, the hardest part of reaching out to others is shutting down the the internal chatter that talks them out of opening the door. How you conduct yourself afterwards though, is also incredibly important.<p>I suspect investors as a class try to grit their teeth and discount awkwardness and narcissism in the hopes of finding the next Mark Zuckerberg, however I also think being a genuine and likable person - which for the most part means genuinely liking other people - is a great path to a good relationship in this and any other circumstance.",1320621135

I think I know the co-founder market quite a bit: I ran the co-founders meetup in Silicon Valley for a few years, and ran foundrs.com to get people to work together on startups.<p>1. As a business, targeting broke founders is not a get-rich-quick approach. I did it for love of entrepreneurs.<p>2. Finding a co-founder is hard. Over the years, I became convinced that personal chemistry is very important (that's why I moved from an online site to in-person meetups). And it takes time. Think 1 month of working together, minimum, before you even should consider someone as a co-founder.<p>After ~3 years of effort, the one very successful result fro my efforts is the co-founders equity calculator. That is something that a lot of people use, learn from, and solves an immediate issue.

5568822,comment,5567808,5567808,1,0,synapticism,,,"Cute, but think twice about making this the focus of your time as people have advised above. Finding a cofounder is a pain point for many people (myself included) but the market can't be very large. You will also have to address a challenge that regular dating sites have, namely that those who successfully find a match will no longer use your service. Unlike regular dating sites, cofounder-matching sites seem stacked with people looking for help with their idea, perhaps because those willing to work for someone else already have a job and aren't as driven to get involved. Are there really an equal number of people who think ""I'd love to work on a startup but don't have an idea of my own that I am passionate about""?<p>That being said, none of the cofounder-matching sites I've used have solved my problem so I suppose there is room in this space. If you did take a cue from OKC and institute a system of curated user-generated Q&As you might be on to something. The services I've used were primitive in their matching ability (e.g. I am a developer looking for a designer, which tells you nothing about values, principles, working style, etc.) so hey, maybe you could make it work.",1366257375

Bigger organization is, more chance somebody sleeps at the wheel, somebody takes shortcut, somebody is lazy, somebody just doesn't care. And if the money is abundant, there's less control over how exactly every cent is spent, so it could very well be that somebody hired this sleazy company to get good numbers for his annual review and his superiors were distracted by something else and didn't know a thing.

Given the large gold sell off a few days ago, I am sure many of those guys are pissed.<p>Either way, my point was simply that as a general rule, the sovereign bond markets are usually good, forward looking indicators about the health of the economy of a country (relative to others).

Our reaction was, let's just say, extreme surprise.<p>The two guys in the room (I'm guessing that room is <i>always</i> manned, even during a refit) immediately understood our concern. ""No no,"" they said, ""that's not the missile computer. <i>That's</i> the missile computer."" They pointed behind us at a giant grey metal cabinet.

5568799,comment,5567928,5568064,2,0,jcr,,,"Though I have reasonably good vision under some conditions, I deal with\none of the mild variations of ocular albinism. I can see pretty good but\nI can't handle some things very well like bright lights, flickering, or\nsome areas of the spectrum, such as older florescent lights. Most of the\nweb where black text is put on a white background is painful for me to\nread, but luckily I know how to configure my browser to override the\ndefault display colors.<p>Over the years, I've set up many computer systems for people with\nvarious types of vision limitations, including text-to-speech, special\nmagnification, color pallets within visual range, alternate fonts, and\nBraille display systems. Sadly, I can't read Braille by touch, and when\nI check systems to make sure they're working right, I do it visually.<p>Text-to-speech is helpful, but there are many textual clues which are\nnever vocalized. For example, on a UNIX mailing list one user was having\ntrouble understanding some of the emails due to the fact that the\nconvention for indicating a manual page is to put the name of the manual\npage followed by a left parenthesis, then the number of the manual\nsection, followed by a right parenthesis. His screen reader just sort of\nskipped over the parenthesis, so he never realized he was being directed\nto the text based manuals.<p>The major problem with Braille displays is their cost. Most of them are\nheavily protected by patents, insanely expensive, and extremely limited.\nBraille is tough to do well on most modern computer systems. Most modern\ngraphical user interfaces are just not designed to give an alternate way\nof interacting with the system.<p>I've always wondered if it would be feasible to create a pin display?<p>The idea would be basically replacing the pixels of visual displays with\npins to create a tactile display. Graphical elements, even pictures,\ncould be represented with raised or lowered pins. The text could be\ntranslated to Braille, or rendered as raised pins in a touch-readable\nfont.<p>It would not solve the issue of Braille illiteracy exactly, but from my\nignorant view as a sighted person, I believe it could help in a lot of\nways, including literacy.",1366256361

In particular, some major pain points:<p>1. Use rbenv or rvm. Half the problems I notice with beginners stem from installing rails with apt-get or something.<p>2. Your controller is meant to be simple glue between model and view - if you're putting tons of code in there, you're doing it wrong.<p>3. Unit test. A lot. This is especially good for beginners because you often make little errors when you're starting out.<p>4. Unit testing isn't enough. Functional testing is important too.<p>5.

Put $500 cash and 10 bitcoins on each of the two exchanges.  Then if the price rises to $55 on exchange A but doesn't move on exchange B, you can buy 10 more bitcoins on B and sell your 10 bitcoins on A for $550, you now have a balance of $1050 at A and 20 bitcoins at B.  Since you started out with 20 bitcoins and $1000, and ended up with 20 bitcoins and $1050, you made $50 profit.<p>You can only participate in trades in the other direction (buying bitcoins on A, selling on B) until and unless you can move the cash and bitcoins between the exchanges, which may take hours or days.<p>Of course, there are a lot of assumptions built into these numbers:  The numbers assume your trading is sufficiently small compared to the total market size that your operations won't change prices, and the exchanges and blockchain charge you no transaction fees.  These aren't absolutely true in practice, of course, with the consequence that prices can deviate a little between exchanges without creating an arbitrage opportunity.<p>Shorting would make things easier, because then you wouldn't have to keep the coins in your account at A in order to sell them, you could borrow them on demand, sell them, and then transfer from B or your wallet at leisure.<p>Likewise, being able to move funds quickly would help you out by reducing the time when half of your capital is out of the game because you're moving it around (I'm assuming you'll transfer 10 bitcoins to A and $500 to B after you did the trade to get back to the original situation), and the other half is half-useless because it can only be used to trade in one direction.<p>But neither of these features is necessary to allow you to make guaranteed profits when (or if) sufficiently large price differences appear.",1366254569

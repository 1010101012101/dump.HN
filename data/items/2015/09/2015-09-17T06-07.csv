10231948,comment,10229112,10230586,0,0,lcc,,,"I absolutely loved using BlaBlaCar when I was backpacking in France. It was recommended to me by several other travellers who all raved about it. It is a fraction of the price of the train, and far more convenient (in terms of pick-up/drop off locations and timing) than the bus. Plus I met some pretty cool people along the way.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m not optimistic about a similar service doing well in North America. The main advantage BlaBlaCar has in Europe is geography. Cities in North America are more scattered. Also, French culture is much more open to hitchhiking, which BlaBlaCar feels like a natural extension to. And European road tolls are far more expensive than in North America, giving drivers a much larger incentive to take some ridesharers with them. For example, on a long weekend roadtrip along the Cote d&#x27;Azur my French friend and I racked up close to 200 Euros in tolls, but happily made almost half of that back by picking up BlaBlaCar passengers at various convenient points along the way.",1442472898

The PloyPasswordHash is the key to how it does it - but really it doesn&#x27;t matter.  All that matters is a password (or a hash of it) goes in, the blackbox maybe reads some data from the (effectively public) password database, and a yes/no comes out at the cost of stuff all CPU time.<p>The point is - if you can reproduce the blackbox once per GPU node on a password cracker it&#x27;s no better than any other scheme.<p>So the security of the scheme rests on the attacker not being able to reproduce the blackbox.  If it were a real blackbox sitting somewhere secure then maybe - but it&#x27;s not.  They make a large point of saying this scheme has no secret hardware sauce - is it&#x27;s just software, in reality just another process running on the web server.  If you managed to get a copy of the memory image of that process it&#x27;s game over.  But we can&#x27;t use that weakness to attack it because it is acknowledged in the paper.<p>During normal operation the blackbox creates it&#x27;s secrets by effectively combining a _lot_ of passwords (say N) from users.   Thus you need N valid passwords before you can crack one.  I think they achieved that, and it does indeed make the it near impossible to recreate the blackbox by brute force - if all you have is the public password data base and a copy of the code.<p>But it&#x27;s not that simple.  Firstly they acknowledge a naive implementation doesn&#x27;t work because an attacker can just create N accounts and feed the passwords to the blackbox so it can initialise itself.  In addition there is a bootstrap problem - no user can validate their password until N password have been gathered by having N attempted logins.<p>They get around that by having N (or close to N) special accounts which they call protector accounts.  These accounts are presumably created by the server admin and thus can be trusted.  They are used for both bootstrapping (implying they are available at boot time) and preventing the flood attack (by insisting some of the special accounts must be part of the N).<p>And so we get to the real issue: the passwords for those accounts must be entered when the machine boots.  Effectively they are the secret the blackbox needs to do it&#x27;s stuff.  Replacing the PolyPasswordHash with a process that demands a single secure password be entered when the machine boots would work just as well.  Eg, that password is an extra salt fed to a cryptographic hash along with the password word and on disk salt, and the result must match the hash stored on disk.  Without knowing that salt there is no way to validate the passwords.<p>Sure entering N passwords isn&#x27;t hard, but would you enter N passwords when there is a method offering equivalent security when you enter just one?  And even that isn&#x27;t the real issue - the real issue is fuck all corporations on the planet have employees willing to be woken up a 2 AM in the morning when a server boots to enter just one password.",1442472797

And respect to Boston for the way they handled the marathon bombings back in 2013.<p>> the actual damage they did in the September 11 attacks has been dwarfed, at least economically, by the fact that we have essentially ruined our air-travel system in response.<p>That however is a one-sided statement. The question is always: how many attacks did we prevent with the new security? You can&#x27;t just weigh up 9/11 vs. the cost of airline security. You have to see 9/11 <i>plus</i> any attack that was prevented (which I agree is hard/impossible to measure) vs. our security costs.<p>I don&#x27;t deny that some air-travel security is OTT. But you can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s pointless.<p>(Quite apart from the fact that customers, out of fear, nowadays probably wouldn&#x27;t fly with an airline that didn&#x27;t provide an insane amount of security.

Crystal has a great price and is the only one to let you report an ad not blocked or broken page so that the ad block list can be updated. Purify lets you block scripts and images on top of font-blocking options also in Peace. Crystal missed an ad that Purify (and Peace) caught, but Peace was the only one that seriously removed all the cruft causing slowdowns, even Google+ news site pop ups and like button pinned banners from The Verge in addition to blocking ads. So my recommendations are Crystal for price, Peace for well, exactly what it says on the tin, and Purify if you&#x27;d like to block images and scripts also.

In the 70s and 80s, palestinian movements were regularly blowing bombs and taking hostages, along with far left extremists. A lot of state sponsored terrorism in the 80s and 90s, from our new &quot;friends&quot; Iran and Syria. And a lot of that terrorism was home grown (IRA, ETA, left wing).<p>For instance in the EU:

The number of attacks and number of victims has been pretty much consistent since the 50s with a small spike with the Madrid bombings.<p>What has changed is our sensitivity to terrorism which has become absurdly high. There are violent crimes happening every day which kill an order of magnitude more people. Gang violence alone in the US kills several 9/11 every year. There are thousands of knife attacks just in London every year. None of that even make it to the news anymore.<p>And the number of deaths linked to terrorism (1,100 in Europe since the 50s according to that wiki article) is dwarfed by things like death due to accidental drowning (35,000 <i>every year</i> according to eurostat).<p>It is useful to remember this when we see politicians in pretty much every western countries throwing out of the window basic civil liberties in the name of the war on terror. The budget spent on anti-terrorism should be better spent teaching people to swim.",1442471808

Of the 648 groups identified in the RAND-MIPT Terrorism Incident database, only 4% obtained their strategic demands. More recently, Cronin (2009) has reexamined the success rate of these groups, confirming that less than 5% prevailed…Chenoweth and Stephan (2008, 2011) provide additional empirical evidence that meting out pain hurts non-state actors at the bargaining table. Their studies compare the coercive effectiveness of 323 violent and nonviolent resistance campaigns from 1900 to 2006. Like Gaibulloev and Sandler (2009), the authors find that refraining from bloodshed significantly raises the odds of government compliance even after tactical confounds are held fixed. These statistical findings are reinforced with structured in-case comparisons highlighting that escalating from nonviolent methods of protest such as petitions, sit-ins, and strikes to deadly attacks tends to dissuade government compromise. Chenoweth and Stephan employ an aggregate measure of violence that incorporates both indiscriminate attacks on civilians and discriminate attacks on military personnel or other government officials, which are often differentiated from terrorism as guerrilla attacks (Abrahms 2006; Cronin 2009; and Moghadam 2006). Other statistical research (Abrahms, 2012, Fortna, 2011) demonstrates that when terrorist attacks are combined with such discriminate violence, the bargaining outcome is not additive; on the contrary, the pain to the population significantly decreases the odds of government concessions.",1442471264

Callbacks) than code that looks synchronous but executed async. One thing that does require watching out for is that there are no blocking calls. Green threads, coroutines, fibres seem so much nicer as a programming abstraction. Is this view even contentious?<p>This does not address parallelism though. These are about exchanging control between stacks of execution, only one such stack is active in an unit. There could be multiple such units though and rub lies in should they synchronize by messages (less buggy) or shared mutable state (at times faster if serialization is expensive. Think Python).<p>A model that I like is different units of execution ( threads) in a common address space, each hosting coroutines or their ilk with the units sync&#x27;ing exclusively by message passing but without the need of serialization because they live in a common address space.",1442470522

Most of the time I go to the doctor, he doesn&#x27;t tell me anything any nurse couldn&#x27;t (and it&#x27;s probably something I knew myself, walking in). So costs go up. That&#x27;s all government.<p>a) if it&#x27;s something &#x27;you already know yourself&#x27;, why are you going to see a doctor?<p>I&#x27;ve been to see a doctor (apart from return visits for a followup, or health certificates for my visa/work permit) a total of twice, in the last 10 years I&#x27;d say. Once I sliced my finger open (and it had to be cauterised) the other I had a weird allergic reaction to something and developed a rash. In that time I&#x27;ve had literally hundreds of cold&#x27;s, the flu 3 times (in one year!) and plenty of small cuts bruises etc.<p>Why didn&#x27;t I go to the doctor for all of those? Because I don&#x27;t need a doctor to tell me &quot;drink fluids|take over-the-counter medicine|put a band-aid on it|keep warm&quot; for basic health care. If you are visiting the doctor every time you have a cold or flu, maybe you need to stop complaining about your government being inefficient and start taking some personal responsibility.<p>b) just because it costs &#x27;hundreds of dollars&#x27; in America doesn&#x27;t mean it <i>has to</i>. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that your government is known around the world as being pretty ridiculous when it comes to getting shit done. Australia has universal health care, and there was recently a <i>huge</i> issue when the then-newly-elected government tried to introduce a $7 co-payment for each visit to a doctor.<p>> How many of them are due to government regulations?<p><i>American</i> government regulations.

Venmo could just act as a blind intermediary, no questions asked, completing any transactions once both parties have verified their intention to transfer money.<p>That&#x27;s generally how banks work for at least any reasonable sums of money: I can send or receive thousands of euros to whoever and from whoever without worrying that the transfers might be cancelled by some vague policy. With tens of thousands, I&#x27;d have to ask my bank to lift the daily transfer cap beforehand, but still no questions asked. I assume that it goes in a relatively similar way in the USA.<p>Thus, any mobile money transfer service ought to be at least as trustworthy as that. There needs to be a point where the transaction is either complete or discarded, after which both parties can trust it. The service also shouldn&#x27;t discriminate, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a private transfer or a merchant transfer. If they want the money they could sell transaction history imports for bookkeeping at a higher price to merchants or something.<p>Venmo could still do their instant transfer magic and add value there, but them considering whether a transfer is ok or not is akin to an internet service provider who would want to consider which web pages I can view before letting me download them.",1442469687

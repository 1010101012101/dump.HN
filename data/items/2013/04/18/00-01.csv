5568356,comment,5564766,5568077,1,0,ZenoArrow,,,"> Are we talking about the same thing?<p>Admittedly I stopped following the development of Haiku and other alt operating systems over a year ago, so I couldn't say for sure whether the file system is in userspace. Doesn't seem like a good idea in the long run, hopefully it's just a temporary measure.<p>> being able to ship custom versions of libraries without having to deal with a package manager, library incompatibilities across applications, et, al, is an advantage.<p>But it's not always an advantage. Library duplication has a cost in terms of storage, plus the mechanism for program upgrades is clunkier than package managers allow (essentially either you have to download the full version of each program update or programs are bundled with their own package management mechanism, duplicating effort).<p>> Led by ex-Mac people, including the former CEO of Apple. Targeted at the BeBox (PPC) and PPC Macs. Shopped to Apple for purchase. It was intended to be the successor to MacOS that Copland wasn't.<p>Jean-Louis Gasse was a senior member at Apple, but never the CEO. BeOS was targetted at BeBox (their own machine) at first, then when that platform didn't take off it was targetted at PPC Macs, then x86 PCs. The purchase talks happened because the OS was struggling to gain market share.<p>> Then maybe the new Haiku leadership should stop blindly copying what they're familiar with from Linux.<p>As I said before, the design is quite different from Linux package managers, so Haiku are doing things their way.",1366246775

5568335,comment,5566992,5567779,4,0,bratsche,,,"I <i>was</i> speaking for myself.  Since this is Hacker News and people are interested in business, I wanted to talk about what's unique about Phish and what they're providing that nobody else is willing (and quite frankly, able) to.  While there are some bands that I prefer in their studio-album form, my overwhelming preference tends toward the excitement of live shows if they're good.  I was originally a music student before I switched to writing software, and so perhaps my hours spent in the practice room shaped my appreciation for music more in the direction of the performance.  But the real point of my original post is that in the world of pop and rock, <i>almost everyone</i> is leaning on the studio to craft their music and very few are properly <i>good</i> at singing or playing their instruments.  And that's the interesting part about Phish, because they're not necessarily very good songwriters (sorry fellow Phish fans, but their lyrics are just not very good ;) ) but they are actually very good musicians and performers.  Even if you don't get into their music that much, you kind of have to hand it to them for being basically the only band out there that is willing to sell you a download of their concert almost immediately after it's done.<p>I'm aware that Led Zeppelin wasn't a famously great live band. Even Jimmy Page has written about how difficult it is to find any decent recordings of live shows of theirs.  But ""How the West Was Won"", even though it has had a lot of studio enhancement work to it, is just so much more exciting than their studio recordings.  It has a more improvisational feel to it in many places, and you get a sense of ensemble and of reaction between the band members and between them and the audience.<p>I didn't mean to say that <i>all</i> live music is, by definition, better and I certainly didn't say you're <i>required</i> to like live music.  I'm sorry you're choosing to interpret my original comment as some kind of personal attack on your music listening habits, but I hope you'll get over it.",1366246407

5568313,comment,5567029,5567029,3,0,enoch_r,,,"> According to the efficient-markets hypothesis (EMH), which still dominates the analysis of financial markets, this should be impossible. The EMH states that the market value of an asset is equal to the best available estimate of the value of the services or income flows it will generate. In the case of a company stock, this is the discounted value of future earnings. Since Bitcoins do not generate any actual earnings, they must appreciate in value to ensure that people are willing to hold them. But an endless appreciation, with no flow of earnings or liquidation value, is precisely the kind of bubble the EMH says cant happen.<p>No. No no no no no.<p>EMH doesn't say that everything must be priced according to the ""best available estimate of the value of the services or income flows it will generate."" For example, if I pay $20,000 for a car, that doesn't mean that the present value of the extra income I'll earn thanks to that car is $20,000. It might mean the <i>car makes my life more pleasant and convenient.</i> Dollars are valuable for exactly the same reason--since everyone I know will accept dollars instead of whatever it is they'd like to buy <i>with</i> dollars, having dollars makes my life extremely convenient. That, not the fact that I need them to pay taxes, is what makes dollars so valuable.<p>The issue here is that there are network effects. Just as dollars are more valuable to me <i>because</i> they're used and accepted by everyone I know, or a fax machine is only valuable to me if I know someone who can receive my faxes, a currency is only valuable when someone else is willing to accept payment in it. This means that, as a currency is adopted by higher and higher proportions of the population (or as the perceived odds of that rise), its value also rises.<p>Bitcoin definitely looks like a bubble to me. It's a small market, it's dominated by people with strong philosophical positions that predispose them towards BTC. And shorting is difficult. But the reasoning in the article is absurd.",1366246045

Governments impose a tax burden payable only in the state's currency (so that people are forced to offer their output for sale in that currency), then they provide that currency.<p>The way to be fiscally responsible with your currency is to print enough so that everyone has a job, but so much that you're overrunning your output capacity and increasing inflation.  Keep interest rates on bonds (if you choose to issue them) lower than your GDP growth (and since you're the monopoly issuer of your currency, you have control over interest rates) and you won't have issues with expanding debt % [1].<p>The first response to this is usually ""well, Greece"" or ""well, Zimbabwe"".

He gives no evidence for this claim except to reference a ""controversial"" book - perhaps controversial because of its wildly inaccurate thesis?<p>Unless the contention is that humans traded solely by barter before states came along to tax them, mediums of exchange (money) obviously predate the statist invention of fiat money. In fact fiat money is a relatively recent phenomenon, as money was historically backed by precious metals long before states invented unbacked fiat money and central (statist) banking.<p>Which doesn't in any way invalidate his argument that Bitcoin is a bubble. It's totally irrelevant to the Bitcoin issue. It's just wrong by itself.<p>Another thing that's just plain wrong is the attempt to refute the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH). The only reason Bitcoin actually does have a value above 0 at the moment is precisely because statist meddling in the market has created a huge demand for an alternative to fiat money - such a huge demand in fact that people are willing to try almost anything, including Bitcoin, or even riskier methods with a high failure rate (such as J. Orlin Grabbe's early anonymous banking system DMT, or unaudited gold-backed e-currencies that may actually be backed by nothing at all, among many other examples).<p>If we had uncrippled free-market gold-backed electronic currencies (such as e-gold was before it was attacked and destroyed by the feds) there would be zero demand for bitcoin as the existing currencies would have all the benefits of Bitcoin, while also being backed by a commodity with a base value (not 'intrinsic value').<p>So, it _might_ be a refutation of EMH if Bitcoin were to be successful long-term in an actual free market. As nowhere on this planet do we find anything even remotely resembling an actual free market, his argument against EMH is as much of a straw man as all the other examples that pinkos trot out as examples of ""market failure"" while pretending that there is a free market somewhere, which there isn't. All such examples are really examples of statist intervention failure, not market failure, as the market we are talking about is highly crippled and not remotely free.",1366244534

I don't find those examples compelling, but maybe I'm just missing something.<p>I don't have a thought about the wikipedia backtracking example.<p>Regarding cache-vs-RAM, or regarding RAM-vs-disk, I see no reason you cannot take the work that the parallel units do, and serialize it onto a single processor.  Let me consider the example you gave.<p>Initially, you have two processors with caches of size N/2, and a problem of size N on disk.  You effortlessly split the problem into two parts at zero cost (ha!), load the first part on procA, the second part on procB.  You pay one load-time.  Now you process it, paying one processing-time, then store the result to disk, paying one store-time.  Now you effortlessly combine it at zero cost (again, ha!), and you're done.<p>In my serial case, I do the same effortless split, I load (paying one load), compute (paying one compute), then store (paying one store).  Then I do that again (doubling my costs).  Then I do the same effortless combine.  My system is 1/2 as fast as yours.<p>In short, I think ""superlinear speedup"" due to memory hierarchy is proof-by-construction that the initial algorithm could have been written faster.

Their actual contribution is their network and their guidance, which isw hat consumes their time and what everyone applying wants.<p>So, the quantity and the limit of the ""many people"" is relevant to how big YC is and how many people they find worthful to invest.",1173757902
3825,comment,3820,3824,0,0,brett,,,"Yeah, given the amount YC gives it's as if they just want to make sure poorer founders won't have to get day jobs in the time they've alloted to impart advice. ",1173757864
3824,comment,3820,3820,0,0,jwecker,,,"While it sure is generous and I'm sure the founders appreciate it, a couple of months worth of rent and ramen noodle money isn't really funding a company.  What you describe is already what YC is- it's just making sure that you are available full-time to really do something about the advice and contacts. :)",1173757687
3823,comment,3820,3820,0,0,danw,,,"Sound good in principle but there are a lot of people who want advice. You need to find a way to prioritise who would benefit most from your advice and connections. What better way to decide than to ask yourself ""Who would I invest in?"". Then you're back at the YCombinator model.<p>If someone can figure out how to make this work then great. I'm not sure YC will work without you narrowing applicants down and giving them money. <p>Perhaps instead of having a single team who advise founders you could have a self supporting community. Put all the startups in a coworking/barcamp like environment for a summer and tell them to help each other out and to share connections. It would be interesting to see how well they could do on their own. You still have the problem of where they would get money to stay alive without funding.<p>[sorry if this is incoherent, I'm sleepy. Will edit to make sense in the morning]",1173757578

This is important for sexual assault survivors, closet gays, the heavily marginalized, etc. to have a space in which they can actually speak with other human beings about their experiences.  This is, in reality, a very important thing.<p>However, it doesn&#x27;t scale well.  Some people have thought, &quot;Hey, I like these safe spaces...what if we make <i>everywhere</i> a safe space?  Wouldn&#x27;t that be great?&quot;  What they miss is there isn&#x27;t one universal definition of safe space and you can&#x27;t just force your definition upon others.<p>In a very general sense, at the reddit scale, &quot;safe space&quot; means protecting those who need protecting.  That means protecting the disempowered, the marginalized, the minorities, etc. from the ignorance and violence of the masses.  Protecting them from the hegemonic power of the majority, which means the patriarchy in general and if we&#x27;re being honest white males in particular.<p>It sounds good in principle but who is &quot;empowered&quot; and who is &quot;disempowered&quot; isn&#x27;t an easy question to answer.  To make things worse the tools of enforcing a safe space are so powerful that the people fighting <i>against</i> oppression often become oppressors themselves.  In the case of reddit there are many members who are openly abusive and believe it&#x27;s morally justified because they&#x27;re &quot;punching up&quot; and it&#x27;s only real abuse when you hurt people lower on the social ladder than you.  (As an aside, this a big reason to claim victimhood: once you&#x27;re a &quot;victim&quot; you get to do things you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t.)",1431701961

While no single assessment will ever properly fit everyone in such a large group of people, the quip goes &quot;the Chinese will do exactly what you tell them to do, but nothing else; the Indians will do exactly nothing you tell them to do but a whole lot besides.&quot;  This seems about right to me, so I don&#x27;t think anyone is being over- (or under-) rated.  If you hand a project to India you will get something that mostly works, is three times as complex as it needs to be, took five times too long to produce, and is completely unmaintainable.  Despite some very impressive individual results, the education system in India is atrocious, on the job education nonexistent, and technical leadership and independence completely lacking, so this result isn&#x27;t surprising.  Americans or Brits sent through the same system and given the same management would produce similar results.<p>By the people who decide that work should be done by Indian engineers instead of those in the company&#x27;s home country?  The answer is more complicated.  Most corporate management is extremely short-sighted; the incentives of the role demand it.  Their primary incentive (handed down by their superiors) is typically lowering home-country head count, average salary (and in the US, especially those oh-so-costly medical and insurance plans), and other coarse personnel cost metrics.  By these metrics, Indian engineers are not overrated.  By the metrics the company will actually be judged by the competitive marketplace, which include time to market, total development cost, and product quality, they are overrated.

I&#x27;m not confused because I fully realize that relative to Earth, my brain and my instruments are running slower due to time dilation. Speed is a time-related measure (d/t) -- you can&#x27;t use relative distance and absolute time to calculate (d/t). You use relative values for both. So the speed I get when I divide by my t is different to what Earth gets when it divides by it&#x27;s t.<p>The problem arises when people accidentally assume an absolute vantage point to observe the two objects. A scientist on Earth will see the gap between the 2 objects close at 1.5c, but he&#x27;ll know better than to make the usual assumption we make on Earth -- that everyone else will see the gap close at the same rate (because time will be slower for some observers).",1431700962
9550923,comment,9550400,9550815,0,0,fullwedgewhale,,,"I think one difference that I&#x27;ve seen is that the US has a very different attitude toward computer programming.  In the US it&#x27;s more glamorous?  That&#x27;s not the right word, but it seems like when I talk to a number of foreign developers who emigrated to the US, it&#x27;s more about being a good job than it is about being a genius hacker, rich by 25, or being a technical tour de force.  I see a lot more women overseas who become programmers.  Maybe because the culture is different, and becoming a programmer is like becoming an architect or engineer?<p>I think that different culture might self-select US developers the same way top schools produce highly motivated, successful people because they recruit highly motivated, successful kids.  Not to say every US developer wants to climb to the top of some technical or economic mountain, but it seems like maybe there&#x27;s a smudge more passion among US developers.  Also, intelligent, math oriented individuals have other avenues in the US, like finance, (and unlike the rest of the world) dentistry and medicine are lucrative careers.  Meaning you choose programming more because you want to program, but in other countries it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a better paying job.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that in some countries, once you&#x27;ve done a few years writing code, you quickly want to join management ranks and develop a coding allergy.  More so than in the US, where it seems like 50 year old developers still want to write code.  I get the sense that, in some countries, if you don&#x27;t get into management then you are a failure at some level.  So in the US you can find someone with 10+ years experience developing software, but in other countries you just have people who&#x27;ve stagnated and never moved up.<p>I dunno.",1431700959

Working at the big company doesn&#x27;t seem so bad that you&#x27;re unwilling to consider it.<p>Your current employer forces you to demand raises raises rather than just paying you what you&#x27;re worth. This is basically an adversarial relationship and your demands only have teeth if you are willing to walk out the door.<p>Assuming that both companies are more or less equally acceptable as places to work, the choice is:<p><pre><code>  Big company: guaranteed 50% pay bump on the table.
               same sort of work you are doing now.
               more room for growth.
               clearly sees value in the work you do.

  Current company: maybe a pay bump, maybe not.
                   paying below market rate.
                   makes salary increases confrontational.
</code></pre>
One thing to consider is that if you get the 50% raise at your current company, how long will it be before you resent the fact that they were underpaying you before you played hardball? My experience tells my gut that once someone has to threaten to leave in order to get a raise, everyone is usually better off if the person just takes the other job.<p>Finally, in any large company, it is likely that a manager in a position to offer you a job has already worked through any contractual obligations in regard to hiring you away from your current firm. Such contracts typically acknowledge the possibility ways that are reasonable on both sides. But, it is important to ask the manager offering you the job, what the process is.<p>Good luck and congratulations on the offer if nothing else.",1431700372

It originally started as a group of Something Awful users doing what can be described as a trolling operation.<p>SRS&#x27;s stated goal is to highlight people on Reddit saying bad things (casual racism, stuff like that). Someone from the community finds a post somewhere on reddit they feel meets the criterion, and they post it there. Often immediately afterwards, the post, and the user who made it, begin losing karma at a rate that cannot be described as coincidental.<p>One of the rules in SRS is &quot;don&#x27;t touch the poop&quot; - you&#x27;re not supposed to participate in a thread that gets linked there. However, looking at the relation between post time on SRS, and karma over time, there&#x27;s no other explanation for what happens to the scores of comments that get posted there.<p>Before you say &quot;meh, racists, who cares?&quot; - two problems. First, SRS&#x27;s aegis has expanded to cover <i>any</i> criticism of the social justice movement, rather than actual hurtful comments. Second, what&#x27;s happening is explicitly against the site rules regarding vote manipulation (vote brigading) - other subreddits who engaged in similar behavior had to institute rules that mandate either &quot;no participation&quot; links (a CSS hack that disables the voting buttons), or outright banning of intra-subreddit linking at the urging of site administration staff.",1431700208

I think the issue was that this is a whole new way to use 1Password. While the transition from Mac to iOS was a fair bit easier, it wasn&#x27;t having to rethink the data itself. That was just the interface.<p>With the Watch we had to rethink what data was going to be visible. We certainly can&#x27;t show users all of their data on the Watch, it would be too difficult to locate and view all of that data.<p>We had wanted to add OTP support for awhile and were pretty excited about it. We also thought the Watch was a great way to let users see their one time passwords, but this is also why we showed people the application behind the scenes so we could gauge interest. We were excited but it turns out not everyone was as excited as we were, so we had to rethink it.<p>Our use case for this is definitely going to be a bit more difficult than some other applications. They generally tend to display notifications or similar types of bite sized bits of data. We have to find bite sized data that also isn&#x27;t a worry for security reasons to just have in the open potentially.<p>Designing for new products, screen sizes and then having to think about the security side of it is a tough combination.<p>We really just wanted to give our users some inside information. It&#x27;s sort of like what Marco Arment did with his Apple Watch design and redesign of Overcast. While his focused a lot on interface, our&#x27;s focused a lot on what we felt was the more complicated bits for us.<p>Thanks for reading!<p>Kyle",1431700186

Median age is only three years away from my actual birth year, and I was born really close to the peak.

To make that argument more compelling, someone has to actually do the hard work of analyzing the protocol and pointing out actual, specific engineering problems caused by it which would be fixed by using something like SCTP or why, for example, the predicted sky falling hasn&#x27;t occurred with in 15 years of TLS not being implemented at the kernel level.<p>Thus far, the only serious work I&#x27;ve seen shows that something like SCTP or QUIC could possibly be a fair percentage faster on lossy networks. That&#x27;s something which merits future work, particularly since either would be relatively easy to swap into place for the lower levels of HTTP2 now that the protocol has first-class support for the concepts, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a good reason to roll back deployment of a production-ready protocol to wait for everyone to upgrade their kernels first.<p>> there also will be a lot of proxy/firewall appliances that block HTTP/2<p>The beauty of reusing HTTPS is that this not the case for most firewalls and since HTTP/2 did not change the semantics, the default behaviour for anyone running an old tampering proxy is not to enjoy the performance benefits but otherwise experience no problems. That seems like a good compromise to me: full backwards compatibility with the cost of non-support being born by the slackers and reusing existing practice means that a much smaller percentage of users are affected.<p>> nagging reminder: &quot;Your web-experience would be much improved (or: this premium content could be watched at higher resolution, or security to your banking website, or...) if your network infrastructure would support SCTP/IPv6/DNSsec/, please ask your ISP or Administrator&quot;.<p>The problem with this is that most users will just ignore the message and the few who try to escalate it are probably going to be told no because if their ISP/corporate IT was good they&#x27;d never have seen the message in the first place.",1431699704

The reality is that very few criminals are of the take-hostages-and-murder type in the first place and murdering or stealing from a semi-famous rich person is a surefire way to get caught, especially when Bitcoins are traceable in a way that cash is not. You might as well break in and steal a Picasso painting from some other millionaire.<p>There are lots of people who want to remain private and unknown; the best (though not guaranteed) way is to not do anything worthy of the public notice.

That being said, that same domain formed a basis for massive swaths of the internet community and culture we see today.<p>In any place I&#x27;ve seen these sorts of gestures of &quot;safe-ification&quot;, they seem to serve only to 1. be ineffective; for whatever moderation you have it&#x27;s going to have edge cases and a time delay for enforcement.  2.  Split the community, create _more_ (and often more subtler, now that it has to conform to some rulebook) harassment/drama between the split. 3. Drive away productive parts of the community, for any variety of reasons. (for me it&#x27;s a mix of &quot;I&#x27;ve seen this pattern before and don&#x27;t like where it goes&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t agree that trying to dictate social standards is the proper way.&quot;)<p>Caveat, and I&#x27;m somewhat frustrated that I feel like I need to say this (whether that&#x27;s at myself or the fear that I&#x27;ll be jumped on if I don&#x27;t), I was _VERY_ heavily bullied/harrassed for much of my childhood.<p>I caveat as such to try and say that I don&#x27;t hold this stance from a position of ignorance, but that if I hadn&#x27;t interacted with bad actors in places that are frankly more insulated from real life (the internet) I would have never come to (yes, painful, but still VERY useful in hindsight) realizations about human interaction and my role in it.<p>This rambled a bit, so tl;dr,
Dealing with bad actors is how we learn to deal with bad actors, which is a _critical_ life skill.  
This even aside from that the strategy being applied does not have a successful history, from what I&#x27;ve seen.

Maybe it was some lone hacker or group of hackers like Mr. Szabo, and they threw away the keys.

However, from a gaining experience point of view, those frameworks can get kind of complicated and trying to figure out how some effect is being achieved can be very difficult. I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a certain level of skill you have to get to before you can actually use those frameworks to learn new techniques. When you get to that point, they can be great vehicles for learning how to do certain things.<p>I&#x27;m currently using foundation with SASS[0], Compass[1], and Susy[2]. I only take certain parts from Foundation as I need them. Foundation is built on top of SASS so it&#x27;s easy to pull out parts of the framework. I can say that using a css preprocessor (SASS/LESS[3]) has really made a big difference in the speed I develop and the maintainability of my css. To directly answer your question:<p>>>In other words, how would an expert go about building a responsive beautiful website like, <a href=""https://www.lily.camera/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lily.camera/</a><p>They probably use a preprocessor like SASS or LESS and either build it from scratch or take parts from different frameworks that they need and mix and match. Looking at their html source, they&#x27;re not using a framework directly, but they could still be using one with their css preprocessor which is compiling down to their production css. Also, there&#x27;s a good bit of javascript going on in that site as well. Hope this helps.<p>[0] <a href=""http://sass-lang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sass-lang.com/</a>

During our development stage, Nicholas Woodman, our CEO, entered into a verbal agreement with Neil Dana, an employee since October 2004, pursuant to which Mr. Woodman agreed to share 10% of any proceeds he received from the sale of our equity securities held by Mr. Woodman. Pursuant to Mr. Woodman’s agreement with Mr. Dana, in March 2011, we paid Mr. Dana a cash payment of $6.1 million, and Mr. Woodman reimbursed us in the amount of $6.1 million. We recorded the payment to Mr. Dana as compensation expense. In release of any claim Mr. Dana had to further payments under his agreement with Mr. Woodman, in June 2011 we issued Mr. Dana fully vested options to purchase 6,584,427 shares of Class B common stock under our 2010 Plan at an exercise price of $0.763 per share, and in December 2011 issued to him 270,000 RSUs under our 2010 Plan that will be settled upon a qualified acquisition. We recorded compensation expense of $6.8 million in connection with the issuance of these options. In connection with our equity awards to Mr. Dana, Mr. Woodman entered into a separate agreement with us in December 2011 pursuant to which he agreed to contribute back to us the same number of shares of Class B common stock as are issued pursuant to the exercise of Mr. Dana’s options.
Mr. Dana has been employed by us since October 2004. During 2011, 2012 and 2013, Mr. Dana had total cash compensation, including base salary, bonus and other compensation, of $6.3 million (inclusive of the $6.1 million payment described above), $245,499 and $240,982, respectively.</i>&quot;<p>S1 link <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000119312514404584/d809891ds1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/0001193125144...</a>",1431698921

I put that much in my checking account and everything else in savings and investment. This was after I spent several years putting the majority of my pay on loans to become debt free and paid off the $60,000 in student loans and a very small car loan.<p>If someone makes a salary of $30,000 a year than they probably take home around $22,000 after taxes and insurance. It would be much less comfortable for them to have a <i>lot</i> of savings. True, not impossible, but much much harder than me since their takehome pay is equal to my &quot;frugal&quot; pay. They would have to give up much more than I do. Obviously you can&#x27;t max out your 401(k) and IRA on that salary, maxing those out would be more than your take home pay!

Combined with a queueing system like postal.js, we pretty much have the same thinking model as React. The DOM is now an expression of the data, and D3&#x27;s joins figure out what DOM elements need to be updated. It&#x27;s slightly lower level than React, in that you specify what happens on enter/update/exit, but in terms of efficiency, it seems great (disclaimer: we haven&#x27;t run benchmarks);<p>- if you happen to like CoffeeScript, D3 turns into a very elegant DSL that is consistent for DOM editing, styling and event handling.

But the 50 year old partner who the MBA works for is likely a world-class expert who has done this a dozen times. And if he&#x27;s not, he usually knows someone who is that can be brought in to advise - at a price, of course. The partner is usually the one who sold the work and has the trust relationship with the client. So it fucks with the partner&#x27;s money if the MBA delivers shit work. Management consulting is an apprenticeship business, so the partner is incentivized to make sure the MBA learns how to do things quickly so he can be billed out at higher rates, develop his own relationships with clients, etc. Do that for long enough and you can be a partner pulling in $10 million a year too.<p>Most big management consulting firms these days also do both management consulting and system integration. The margin on management consulting work is sick, but the projects aren&#x27;t that big (a few million dollars over a couple months). The margin on implementation projects is much lower, but the projects themselves can be enormous (think hundreds of millions over several years). So you&#x27;re fucking your implementation guys if you deliver an unimplementable plan. And in a partnership model, if the implementation project fails, the partner who did the management consulting piece of the work still takes a hit.",1431698775

The loud minority that has historically complained about the widespread usage of the VM have been just that, a minority. And it is funny, because things are progressing in that direction with C++ as well (speaking of LLVM or Emscripten). That is not and has never been the real difference between C++ and Java/.NET, but rather in having versus not having a GC. The main reason for why C++ still wins by a good amount in any benchmark is because for performance sensitive code memory access becomes by far the biggest bottleneck and in C++ there&#x27;s simply more opportunity for optimizing memory access patterns.<p>Delphi too lacked a GC. Java and .NET haven&#x27;t killed Delphi, it is Borland that killed Delphi. This isn&#x27;t a winner takes all kind of war (well, maybe it is in Windows land). We live in an industry in which multiple programming languages can coexist. For evidence of this you need to look no further than Linux, the Tower of Babel of our age.<p>And I disagree with you - besides the open-source operating systems that are developed by multiple parties, all &quot;<i>OS vendors</i>&quot; are interested in the lock-in of developers. You&#x27;re mixing cause and effect I think ... when an &quot;<i>OS vendor</i>&quot; adopts a programming language that isn&#x27;t created by themselves, that&#x27;s only because the programming language in question is already popular and here to stay.",1431698677

Simply put, McDonald&#x27;s is what homeless people eat(low in price, high in calories). In the last two or three decades new burger joints have emerged that fill the gap between the dollar menu burger and the $10 restaurant burger. Places like Culver&#x27;s and In-and-Out have taken a larger slice of the _burger_. You can see them combating this with the aggressive advertising towards millennials; the trend-setters. The new non-GMO simple chicken sandwich is a glaringly obvious admittance that their prior adverts failed.<p>To fix McDonald&#x27;s, their only option is to use their superior distribution network to produce marginally higher quality food that is on par with the aforementioned.

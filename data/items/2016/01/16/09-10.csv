That&#x27;s fine with me, I don&#x27;t care one way or another whether I can convince you that losing github would be a disaster for open source but just for a minute consider why all these open source projects that were formerly hosted in different places migrate to github. The community has achieved critical mass and that is what drives this, the technology is entirely secondary to that.<p>If you lose github you lose the community and a user / contributer to say &#x27;apache spark&#x27; will not automatically be a user / contributor of all the other open source projects hosted on github. Single sign on for contribution to <i>any</i> open source project and a consistent user interface are also big pluses (but those are technical), and would be hard to achieve as well.<p>So in my opinion github (and several other services) are now really too big to fail.",1452938243

10914886,comment,10913726,10914257,0,0,Ronsenshi,,,"I agree with general sentiment that teaching journalists programming is not a realistic option - not only is it time consuming, but might also simply not workout for people who chose to be journalists. It is a humanitarian area of knowledge, after all, not technical. Of course, some might have affinity with programming, but generally speaking (from my experience at least) young journalists won&#x27;t appreciate the idea of extra class where they have to learn programming.<p>However I believe infographics and data visualization specifically are important when trying to convey densely-packed information so it has to be taught journalists in some form. They should know that given some data they can pick certain type of visualization that would work well within the article.<p>I think some general course on data visualization without jumping into programming would work fine - explain what data visualization is, how it is done, what kinds of data could be used with it, what kinds of representations of data are available and so on. Plus share some resources where people can view various visualization samples.",1452938025

I saw that Target logo over by Barclays Center and thought, &quot;Oh thank god! A real store where I can buy a variety of things and consolidate shopping trips. And it&#x27;s on my way home from the work commute. Great!&quot;<p>Nope. It&#x27;s not any better than a RiteAid or some mom and pop dollar store or &quot;grocery&quot; shop.<p>When I found out that there was another Target even closer to me, I almost didn&#x27;t bother going. I&#x27;m glad I did because it was a genuine (from my perspective as a Texan) Target store.<p>If Wal-Mart had these express stores in my area, I wouldn&#x27;t bother. If I can&#x27;t find what I need in your store anyway, I&#x27;d rather deal with a local and have the relationship with the business owner where I can at least say, &quot;Hey, I shop here all the time. I am really frustrated that I can&#x27;t find X. Would you consider placing an order for it if I promise to buy X of them every month?&quot;<p>That works.<p>Good luck doing that at a Wal-Mart or a Target.<p>As much as I absolutely despise shopping in Brooklyn, I appreciate the locals. They really will help you out if you make it a point to develop a relationship with them.<p>And I&#x27;m not talking about the hipster-run artisanal crowd. I&#x27;m talking about the immigrants who bust ass and deal with hate speech and accusations of terrorism every time something goes down.<p>I hate the fact that they are good businessmen and stock only the junk food and cheap crap that people buy. It makes my life more difficult. But they are responding correctly to their market.<p>The difference between these guys and the shitty Target store at Barclays is that I can build a relationship with them. The goods for sale are pretty much the same.<p>And plus, when you are alone and single and new to the city and shit happens in France like it did a couple months ago, you can go hang out with a bunch of Muslims who know your name and drink free beer while they say &#x27;Vive La France&#x27; and condemn that terroristic bullshit and support their community.<p>Try that at a Wal-Mart Express or a gimped up Target store.<p>I don&#x27;t think the big stores like that can really succeed competing with the locals in a place like NYC. I would guess it&#x27;s the same in other dense population centers like DC.",1452937454

Shells and stuff worked better than cygwin\n (2) tcp stack\n (3) gcc<p>That&#x27;s really it. X was a fucking nightmare to get to work &quot;correctly&quot; and then, as now, &quot;correctly&quot; on X means &quot;it handles a remote networking case no one cares about better than the alternatives but still poorly, and everything else about it is totally broken.&quot;<p>Hardware support for every feature that was becoming interesting in PCs in 1995 (basically anything where economies of scale were making interesting stuff cheap) was absolutely terrible on Linux. Drivers for PC hardware, even the kind of PC hardware nerds liked (SCSI CD-ROM drives) were super flaky or non-existent.  Application software was horrendous. There was no support at all for anything that still had a licensing regime around codecs, which, at the time included all the media software.<p>Linux was &quot;quite good&quot; in that you could set it up in a corner of your house and run httpd. That was dope in 1995. But compared to Amiga as a user-facing hacking desktop, it sucked shit. Hell, it sucked shit compared to a PC running Windows or a Mac.<p>Seriously, find a 486SX/25 w/ 4MB ram, a 160MB disk, a decent modem, and an S3 video card and put like, Yggdrasil on it.

You&#x27;ll also find lots of radio stations, music and video streaming online. There are more and more opportunities for remote work.<p>On the other hand, a city of 10 million has far more restaurants, clubs and social opportunities than a city of 1 million.

People preferred this term to convey the information that some languages like CoffeeScript are just mere syntactic sugar over Javascript.<p>On one hand that&#x27;s superfluous when the very definition of a &quot;<i>compiler</i>&quot; is that of a program that transforms source code from one programming language to another. And on the other hand, people are using it incorrectly.

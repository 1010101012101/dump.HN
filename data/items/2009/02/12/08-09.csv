But actual government debt has to be backed by a claim to someone's labour and that someone is the tax payer. If there is no such backing all that fiat money will quickly lose its value.",1234428649

478224,comment,477955,478153,0,0,earl,,,"Don't be histrionic -- Obama isn't discussing changing bankruptcy law every month.  This is a single change.  Further, it resolves some nasty agency issues where securitized mortgages that can't be reasonably modified -- the servicing agencies lack the rights -- or won't be modified, because the servicing agencies don't get paid for modifications, which is an extremely expensive process.<p>And yes, lenders blah blah bah lower risk blah.  How's that working out for them?  The fact is (and nobody is disputing this) homes are overpriced.  Home prices will fall.  How far and how fast is a matter of direct interest to most people in the nation, particularly other homeowners.  Measures we can create to prevent overshooting on the downside are probably worthwhile.  If we can get people to cover a large portion of their mortgage debt, the nation as a whole is probably better off -- fewer bank defaults (and those are your retirement and insurance funds at risk), fewer fund collapses (again, your retirement and insurance and etc were invested into those CDOs), fewer foreclosures, fewer disrupted communities, higher home prices for non-foreclosed households, etc.<p>The whole idea that we could just foreclose and the bank could get their money out hasn't been tested with a crisis like this.  In some communities in socal and Florida, 50% of home sales are foreclosure sales!  The bank is going to recover what -- probably well under 50 cents on the dollar in this case.  Finally, the whole bit about a judge changing the terms of the mortgage does prevent people from being stuck under crushing debt -- that's the point!<p>Finally, the author of your link is, well... stupid.  Very briefly: Bear Stearns was rescued because if they failed, they'd take all the other banks with them via intertwined obligations.  We need banks to act as financial intermediaries in all sorts of transactions... no banks, no credit markets, no ability for people and business to borrow, no economy.  Fannie and Freddie got bailed out because, well, amongst other reasons China told us to.  And when somebody owns more than a trillion dollars of your debt, you need foreign central banks to buy another trillion or two in 2009, when they say jump we get to say how high sir.<p>Now look -- you appear to think that I'm happy with this situation; like other people, particularly those of us that don't own homes, I'm pretty pissed off about the whole thing.  But the time for preventing this was in 2000- maybe 2005, and now what's done is done and the best we can do is ameliorate this for as many people as possible.  That pretty directly implies the government should do their best to stop the rapid home price falls... the prices will fall no matter what, but the more they fall in real instead of nominal terms probably the better off the nation will be.<p>Finally, prices in the markets aren't low and uncertain because of government meddling -- prices are low and uncertain because most banks are probably bankrupt, we as a country are sitting on enormous piles of bad debt and nobody can figure out whom and how bad, and btw, the entire world is entering a severe recession.  Simultaneously.  From China's imports that plunged this month, to the US, to Korea, to England and W Europe, it's hard to find any bright spots in this economy.",1234427650

478220,comment,477858,477858,0,0,mtkd,,,"It has hardly even started yet.<p>Many tech companies have been insulated as they were funded (therefore not relying on revenue for survival).<p>There will be no new funds for many of these companies - so they need revenue - and they have to achieve revenue in a contracting economy.<p>I had hoped we'd see an uptick in activity in H2 2009, but I fear it's going to 2010 or 2011 before we start to see real recovery - the history of the 1930s indicates it may be even later than that. Many economists are saying comparisons with 1930s are wrong, which could be true, but in the 1930s the economies outside the US were unaffected and exports to those economies dragged the US out of depression - this time it's global.<p>It's possible we will see some fake recoveries, some may last a year or so, but the problems this time are so vast it's going to take many years to heal.<p>These massive spending measures that are being put in place all have consequences and we've got to deal with those before we get back to stable growth.<p>Some companies, for instance those doing business apps that save money, will be counter cyclical and may do well. For the rest it's going to be hard times.",1234427281

478217,comment,478086,478086,0,0,uuilly,,,"I played ice hockey since I could walk until I turned 21.  At the end of my senior year in HS I was getting mildly recruited to play in college.  I got a bad concussion when a guy but-ended me in the chin w/ his stick.  I was out cold but went back to playing a few days later b/c I didn't want to loose my chance.  I started getting concussions from mild hits and I ended the season w/ about 4.<p>The worst was the nausea and the headaches.  A few times I went completely deaf and a few others I lost peripheral vision.  Every time I would forget basic words and common phone numbers (pre-cellphone.)  It was incredibly frustrating but I think it's worse in your head than in reality.  You actually don't need to talk fast and effectively to be a competent human.  Take a few weeks and go really slow.  Make it a goal to just get by.  You'll be normal before you know it.  No doubt get the EEG's and MRI's just to make sure, but chances are you just have to ride it out.  While your experiments are fascinating I think they'll drive you nuts in the end.  Load up your netflix and relax.  Hope you feel better soon...",1234427065

478215,comment,477874,478151,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think I mostly agree though I think ""quick and dirty"" has a negative connotation that is not necessarily justified.  A lot of corporate environments has web apps that are only used by 10 or 20 people and which are being transmitted over ultra fast gigabit connections.  In those cases the so called ""quick and dirty"" app is very much a plus in that it cuts down on vital developer time and still allows a company to have a web based applications (with all the advantages therein)<p>What had been missing until now, at least in an official capacity, was a way to make serious public facing web apps and I think Microsoft has made great strides with their support of Jquery and the ASP.NET MVC project.<p>From that perspective I think Microsoft is in a really good place right now.  Webforms continues to serve that corporate environment that other companies don’t seem to care about and ASP.NET MVC allows them to challenge Rails et al. in the web space.",1234426775
478214,comment,478114,478114,0,0,c3o,,,"Vienna, Austria has had a system based on the same technology for a few more years than Paris, albeit on a much smaller scale (600 bikes vs. 20,600). The bikes are much more rugged here: They're single-gear and have solid rubber tires -- surely less comfortable, but also much easier to maintain.<p>In either city, to rent one you need to provide a debit or credit card -- so I don't quite get how they can be incurring such high losses from lost/stolen bikes.\nWikipedia says ""The credit/debit card will be charged €150 if a rented bike is not returned"" in Paris. In Vienna, you'll receive a €600 bill.<p>A previous attempt in Vienna with an anonymous system where you just had to deposit a €2 coin to unlock the bike failed miserably: Hundreds were stolen within the first week.",1234426675

478210,comment,477858,477858,0,0,ardit33,,,"Yes.  Well, at least the panic is over, and some companies are hiring cautiously.<p>I got three job inquiries last two days, from recruiters and:   I got another request from a startup that I got an offer in October,  that week that Sequoia send the RIP presentation.\nThey had to withdraw the offer, b/c of a hiring freeze mandated by the board. It seems that they are hiring again, and contacted me if I was still available.<p>I am not, as I found a new job in a same size startup.<p>Basically, if you are really good, you will be able to find a job.  I might take some time,  but there is some hiring going on.  The only thing is that there is a lot of people laid off, so there is a lot of competition out there, and some interviews will end up like an ""american idol"" contest, but be patient and don't get discouraged.<p>In another anecdote, mobile seems to be a field that is still hiring.  A friend of mine was laid off in December, but he was able to find contracting work within 3-4 weeks.<p>I think this recession will probably drive some subpar talent out of the industry,  which I think it is a good thing.",1234426206

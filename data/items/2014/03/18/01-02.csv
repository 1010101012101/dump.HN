7419527,comment,7416507,7418381,6,0,MertsA,,,"Under Linux you can. You can boot the kernel with the maxcpus argument set to 1 or the number of cores you want the Linux kernel to use and then on a quad core machine you have 3 cores available all the time and setup to where Linux won&#x27;t ever need to handle interrupts on that core. Then you just start your application and set the affinity to that unused core.<p>You can extend this further by doing things like mmaping in 4GB of memory through the kernels hugepage support and lock the physical to virtual address map so the kernel can&#x27;t touch your physical block of ram you just allocated. Then you can do things like talk directly to a pci device like a network card and set up DMA directly from a NIC into a buffer in your applications memory.<p>All of this is done completely in userspace but you get all the performance benefits of implementing everything like it was running in Ring 0 and the kernel is not involved in anything apart from the initial setup and teardown. You can build an extremely high performance application basically running on bare metal but with the Linux kernel still running on a different core to handle anything that doesn&#x27;t directly involve your application and there wouldn&#x27;t need to be any syscalls between the two to service some request.",1395107979

7419483,comment,7418583,7419424,4,0,drawkbox,,,"I stated outright it was sexism and asked more women to relay those situations so people do understand it.  I was just stating from the side of that not all that might be deemed sexism was always meant as such.  i.e. usually it is stupidity over arrogance which some assume the latter and more often it is the former. Almost all misunderstandings stem from some aspect of this. Where people are stupid, they need to learn somehow, examples help.<p>But living in a world with 99% of people not being technical (unless you are at work) you have to assume most people are not and talk to them in that way, nothing to do with gender really. In that aspect talking in a way that a person understands is polite (completely ignoring is another thing entirely -- a good speaker involves all).  Once that person lets it be known that they are technical then a new door opens up and you can drop some acronyms.  Any person will tune their message to their assumed crowd otherwise they waste alot of air. If you go up to 100 people (or women) and just start talking in programmer/technical jargon most of them will look at you funny. I talk to dudes I work with differently that are in business and programming as well. I don&#x27;t talk down to them in any way, I communicate. If they get it, all engines ahead, if not, they ask for a simplified version, same deal with aspects of the business on the flipside.<p>What I see is also a problem in the sexism journey is that sometimes people that are understanding and do see the problem get pulled into it in ways that make them look bad. I almost didn&#x27;t post the message above because I knew I&#x27;d get some of this even though I 100% agree.  So they stay away from it, just because there may be gender issues doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t some give and pull on both sides to help it along.",1395107390

The exercise has been designed so that all the candidate has is a false task and an awkward channel for communication.<p>Coding at interview is essentially always a false task, as the context and realistic goals are stripped away and the problem scaled back to something that can fit into a short timeframe. \nTypically, enough interviewers are bad enough at setting problems that there&#x27;s a &quot;market for lemons&quot; effect --  the candidate does not know ahead of time whether you are a good or poor interviewer. As their goal is to get the job (not to only get the job if this particular interviewer happens to be a good interviewer -- see note) that means a significant portion of their energies goes into second-guessing who they are dealing with. And stage fright -- I&#x27;ve watched candidates make a complete hash of programming tasks at interview, be hired nonetheless (because we saw something else in them), and turn out actually to be competent programmers too.<p>Strip the communication back to just slowly typed text, with a thirty minute timeframe so every communication is exceptionally expensive, and now we have an almost entirely artificial puzzle.<p>Suppose one starts by reading and understanding the code; another starts by running the tests. One decides, given the thirty minute timeframe he&#x27;s going to have to batch his testing at the end because the number of smells identified sounds like it&#x27;s the test measure; another decides to run the tests at every tiny edit because it sounds as if the interviewer wants him to show his test-driven credentials; another decides that interviews like to &quot;see how the candidate thinks&quot; and spends most of his time asking text questions of the interviewer.<p>From this we could deduce, what? To be brutal, I wonder if frankly we might as well be deducing that the first one is a Sagittarius and this week&#x27;s horoscope doesn&#x27;t bode well for them. Because for all we know, the differences in behaviour are as likely to be about different guesses about the interview (it is a cut down task, so what has the interviewer decided to exclude and what have they decided to include, and does this interviewer even have any idea about that?) as about how the candidates actually go about programming on tasks in context.<p>But perhaps that&#x27;s just my scientific curmudgeonliness about the &quot;cult of hiring&quot; -- the irrational belief that programmers interviewing candidates have, usually without evidence, that they are &quot;able to ascertain how a candidate thinks&quot; in a short space of time on an artificial task.<p>While it might be mice to hear how the candidates hired performed, at n=2, we still would not be able to make any reliable inferences.<p>note -- While you might think the candidate would only want the job if it is a good interviewer, that is not true.

When wages are stagnant, income inequality is rising, most companies have little-to-no loyalty to their employees and discard them at will, and many of the rich and comfortable push relentlessly towards eliminating the safety net, then those at the bottom are going to feel more than a little resentful. They feel ignored and powerless, which is a correct assessment of their position.<p>While not all the rich are bad, it&#x27;s very hard in the current climate to have the slightest bit of sympathy for them.

I was the first employee of a company that now employs north of a hundred engineers and generates tens of millions in tax revenue. By any definition of the phrase &quot;individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics,&quot; I am the kind of person that this visa was meant to attract: talent that results in a net gain for the country.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t with the government employees who review the cases; the problem is with the criteria for the visa. It&#x27;s stuck in a world where 40-year old academics were the innovators. Where instead of showing product traction, revenue, and ability to create businesses, you&#x27;re expected to show published papers, academic awards, or inclusion in conference panels. Sure, these are still very valid reasons to want somebody to enter the US; but they shouldn&#x27;t be considered the only reasons.<p>Quite a few very valuable companies were founded by mavericks, dropouts, or just people who stayed away from academia and instead worked on products. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Zuck, the WhatsApp guys, the Airbnb guys. None of these guys were academics. Some dropped out of college. None received nobel prizes, but many had shown previous entrepreneurial success. The visa requirements give this no consideration.<p>--<p>The full list of requirements, of which you have to demonstrably meet at least three:<p>1. Documentation of the individual&#x27;s receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor;<p>2. Documentation of the individual&#x27;s membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields;<p>3. Published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about the individual, relating to the individual&#x27;s work in the field for which classification is sought, which shall include the title, date, and author of such published material, and any necessary translation;<p>4. Evidence of the individual&#x27;s participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization to that for which classification is sought;<p>5. Evidence of the individual&#x27;s original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field;<p>6. Evidence of the individual&#x27;s authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals, or other major media;<p>7. Evidence that the individual has been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation;<p>8. Evidence that the individual has either commanded a high salary or will command a high salary or other remuneration for services, evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence.",1395106075

Suppose you choose not to outbid Dave, because you are smarter, and instead opt to rent an efficiency studio and save up over your life and build a sizable amount of investment assets (because you did not spend frivolously on a large house).

The government is incompetent (and corrupt) to choose what course of action best manages risk.<p>The better answer is to make people (and their insurance carriers) liable for the damage they actually cause. If you drive too fast and kill someone, you should be liable for a Very Large sum of money. If you drive 90MPH and cause no damage, you should be left to your devices. If driving fast has a high correlation to causing damage then insurance companies will figure out a way to charge higher premiums to people who take more risks (with risks defined scientifically by statisticians rather than corruptly by politicians), and the higher premiums will either deter the risky behavior to the extent that the damage caused by the risk is in excess of the value of getting there faster to the driver, or alternatively cause the driver to pay money in the amount necessary to compensate for the risk being imposed on others.<p>There is no need for criminal penalties, which do nothing but create animosity between the police and the population, encourage lawbreaking, encourage the police to issue unwarranted citations (and set inappropriate speed limits or unsafely short yellow lights) in order to generate revenue, etc.<p>The same applies to illicit drug use.

Being close to someone and sometimes wondering whether there&#x27;s something &quot;else&quot; there seems pretty normal. Maybe we should just be OK with a bit of ambiguity in some of our friendships. It won&#x27;t kill you ...<p>I think a few principles, once applied, make navigating the gray zone almost trivial:<p>-First, if you think you might be interested, engage in light harmless flirting and gauge the response. If there is no/negative response, then move on. The flirting should truly be harmless. If you friend feels uncomfortable, unsafe, or demeaned, then you have flirted wrongly. Apologize and move on.<p>-If you&#x27;ve determined you&#x27;re interested, decide whether it is worth acting on. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t - for instance, if you&#x27;re married, or you&#x27;re just too busy or whatever. Just move on.<p>-If you&#x27;re interested and it&#x27;s worth acting on, promptly express interest in a way that is clear and firm, but not embarrassing or intimidating to your friend. Do <i>not</i> express interest if you are not ready to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. If you can&#x27;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer, just move on and try to figure out why. Where a lot of people go wrong here is instead of actually asking, they half-ask and half-demand. <i>That</i> is going to frighten your friend, and you probably won&#x27;t be friends any longer.<p>-If you&#x27;re rejected, accept it and don&#x27;t lash out. If you goofed and made things super-awkward and uncomfortable, then lighten the air with a silly joke or something (ie make it clear that you&#x27;re not going to flip, and that you&#x27;re cool). Lashing out is going to create a toxic environment for everyone, and it&#x27;s going to suck. Instead, deal with your feelings on your own, and continue to treat your friend with respect. And, of course, move on.<p>It&#x27;s maybe a little awkward to continue working next to stop who rejected you--or who you rejected--but in my experience, it really isn&#x27;t that bad at all, and it goes away quickly. What&#x27;s much worse is to ignore one of these steps, and then have things end in a massive immature blow-out. Just take responsibility and be clear, and don&#x27;t have undue expectations.<p>And it&#x27;s often not too late to save yourself. In one case I was a massive douche, but I owned up to my behavior, apologized, and said I hoped we could eventually put this behind us.

My experience with Ada was on decidedly not open source projects, and Ada suffered in this respect in that there wasn&#x27;t a good open source Ada compiler until long after interest in Ada outside of the defense industry faded. Googling for &quot;ada open source&quot; shows a good number of interesting (if dated) possibilities (these might be a good place to start: <a href=""http://www.pegasoft.ca/resources/boblap/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pegasoft.ca/resources/boblap/book.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~mfeldman/ada-project-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~mfeldman/ada-project-summary.html</a>), but not to put to fine a point on it, the cool kids pretty much decided Ada was the US DoD equivalent of COBOL 20 years ago and ignored it.<p>As an aside, Ada was intended for large numbers of programmers of varying, often mediocre skill to cooperate on large programs while minimizing errors and preventing localized programming errors from propagating too far.  That&#x27;s something a lot of OSS projects could use.<p>I also think it&#x27;s important to understand that Ada was one branch of a family of languages descended from ALGOL that looked at the problem through a similar lens (a very not-C/C++ lens).  Pascal is the direct ancestor, of course, but in a addition to Ada, Pascal evolved into a number of other systems programming languages like Modula-2 & -3 and the various Oberons.  Close cousins Mesa & Cedar were Xerox PARC systems programming languages.  There&#x27;s not a lot left of the Modula&#x27;s or Mesa/Cedar (regrettably...Modula-2 was much better than Pascal for non-academic programming and Modula-3 was a really comfortable all-around language), but there&#x27;s a reasonable amount of OSS Oberon laying about.<p>EDIT: How could I forget...if systems programming is your kink, be sure to check out UCSD p-code and ETH m-code.  These are Pascal/Modula virtual machine environments and the direct ancestor of the Java VM and M$ CLR.",1395104881

I can’t imagine Singapour, Beijing and Hong-Kong and GuandDong have any less merits, certainly with hardware, or less things to learn from Y Combinator.<p>What both need is access to capital and access to expertise on how to make that kind of deals; what Y Combinator provides is a needed discipline about testing and scaling, and that. Both travel far better than the founders, who are best because of their network of skilled friends, understanding of local markets and more. Yes, it might require a standard contract to make European or Chinese company have a finance subsidiary in the US to reassure US investors… but dealing with that kind of complication is what YC is good at, much better than any local equivalent.<p>I would hate to see YC come and unify how to make start-ups.

The Greens are many things, but small-l liberal they most definitely are not.  While they include policies on populist measures such as internet filters which appeal to their young voter base, they also include many, many policies which are an anathema to people interested in freedom.  They were a large backer of government regulation of the press, they have many policies which bring in serious regulation of many industries and frequently talk of population caps.  They even have an ex-soviet for a Federal Senator.

Loop unrolling optimizations and the like should really be left to the compiler.<p>If you&#x27;re truly sure you&#x27;re better than the compiler, I&#x27;d imagine an assembly language implementation would be easier to understand than nested switch/while fall through madness.<p>That said.

9827873,comment,9826773,9826773,0,0,davismwfl,,,"So as someone who has a consultancy where we have focused quite a bit on the SMB market I can speak with experience when I say that it is a tougher market at times.  Our enterprise clients are harder to get usually but much easier to sell to in a lot of ways.  You are doing a lot of the right first steps IMO, many of which I personally did too when I started out. Some suggestions after reading your site quickly and reading your questions.<p>1. Your site doesn&#x27;t communicate to the small business owner.  You need to tell/teach them what you can do for them, not use &quot;jargon&quot; or terms they can care less about.  In the end they are wanting to know what problems you can solve or how you can help them make more money. So for example, instead of just saying security and usability on the site.  Frame it in the terms of &quot;did you know&quot;, and mention some specific statistics on SMB&#x27;s where you have relevant knowledge which you can use to improve upon their issues for them.  This is helping them understand what you offer versus just stating terms they may not be 100% familiar with.<p>2. In general SMB&#x27;s don&#x27;t care about you making their team slightly more efficient, they care how you can save them $10k/yr, or better yet, how you can make them an extra $10k or whatever the magic number is.  Many times it is about how you market yourself and what you say more then what you are offering that helps them buy.<p>3. SMB&#x27;s get defensive typically when you approach them too fast or too hard about what they are doing wrong.  They all know they are doing things that aren&#x27;t necessarily correct but they have &quot;made it this far&quot;.  So generally it is not about telling them they are wrong and need to change, its about framing the conversation to say, hey did you know that you have done amazing so far and I am impressed, but it got me thinking that if you did XYZ, you could actually make more money every month or save 1 FTE&#x27;s time per year making you more net income etc.  That is how you spin a conversation and avoid the defensive response. Of course you have to find your own valid position but that is how I do it.  But this opens the door for them to say, oh yea?  Tell me more.  Even if they say your full of shit tell me more, it is opening the conversation and they aren&#x27;t defensive.<p>What I think you are finding is that while you have the skills to fix issues, you don&#x27;t yet know how to present and discuss those skills with people to convince them to hire you.  You probably have had some luck but I would bet it was with people that were either introduced to you by someone they trust or you had a prior/current relationship with somehow.  That isn&#x27;t a knock, it is how we all start.  The great news is at least IMO everyone can learn the sales/marketing skills, they aren&#x27;t secret or all that hard, its just how you frame conversations with prospects.  And you have to expect it will take building up a little bit of a relationship with them.<p>Feel free to reach out to me via email, I am pretty happy to share my experiences good and bad. And good luck, it is fun figuring it all out, at least I think it is.",1435956510

If I am in possession of 1 BTC and I give it to you, I am not in possession of it anymore -- there is nothing that I can do to get it back unless you give it back to me.  There is absolutely no way to do fractional reserve lending with BTC because you can&#x27;t &#x27;lend&#x27; someone BTC -- it&#x27;s either mine or it&#x27;s yours. period.<p>Fractional reserve lending &quot;backed&quot; by BTC is possible, but then, you&#x27;re not actually lending BTC - you&#x27;re lending something that is &quot;not BTC&quot; - namely, a promise to pay BTC on demand, which is no different than fractional reserve lending that was backed by gold in the past (or, as it is today, lending that is backed by the value of the thing that is being lent - fiat currency).<p>The problem is that you can&#x27;t think of BTC like a traditional currency because it isn&#x27;t.  Because it is digital in nature, it can act very much (almost exactly) like a modern currency, but when all is said and done, what you are left with is something that is much more like a commodity than actual currency.<p>Coinbase is free to do their internal accounting in any way that they wish as long as the numbers come out &#x27;correct&#x27; on the balance sheet, but if I deposit BTC with them and then subsequently use that BTC to purchase goods and services, actual bitcoin will be transferred from me (via coinbase) to the merchant.  The merchant receives actual bitcoin as a result of that transaction, not a promise to pay bitcoin at some point in the future.  This is not fractional lending.<p>Banks are legally allowed to issue credit up to a specified multiple of their reserves, so, extending your analogy above, imagine an additional eight people behind you requesting to overdraft their account by $100.  As a result of your $100 deposit, the bank is now legally authorized to approve each of those requests for a total of $900 in credit that was created out of nowhere.  In point of fact, however, the bank can&#x27;t just create money out of thin air.  In order to extend this credit, they must have a reasonable expectation that the loan will be paid back - to act otherwise would have negative effects on the economy and the bank itself.<p>You just can&#x27;t do that with BTC, and, in my opinion, that is not a limitation, but a very positive aspect of bitcoin - it doesn&#x27;t fit into the current economic model.",1435955719

If hospitals were run like startups, 10% of emergency patients would be turned away (&#x27;not the target audience&#x27;), and any medical staff who complained would be labeled &quot;insufficiently pragmatic&quot;.<p>12. If hospitals were run like startups, 90% of them would close their doors within the first year of opening.<p>13. If hospitals were run like startups, patients&#x27; medical information would be used to sell them ads.  The databases storing this information would also be leaked within the first 10 years of opening, since details like security are rarely a priority in a startup.<p>14. If hospitals were run like startups, junior medical staff would be overworked, underpaid, and burnt out.  Actually, this is already the norm (at least in Canada).<p>15. If hospitals were run like startups, patients who went in to have their appendix removed would find that their tonsils and wisdom teeth had also been removed, and an RFID chip with their patient ID had been implanted &quot;to serve them better&quot;.

I use a proxy at work for Firefox due to strict filtering on our primary connection. I was monitoring the amtrack debacle in Philadelphia. I came in the next day to an entirely unresponsive Firefox. I had purposely gone to the home page before leaving to avoid bashing the processing with the live stream. Still, after ~12 hours of being on the cnn.com home page - with NO other usage - Firefox had become unusable. Chrome - with its ~20 normal and ~13 incognito tabs were as stable as they were 3 days ago.<p>I want (and do to an extent) to love Firefox. It was what at one time what expressed to me that there was an alternative to ie. But, I now, in the real world (at least the world I inhabit) can not find it to be better than chrome in any instance. From dev tools to performance. I had no intention of trying to test the differences; I happened to be using ffx for the proxy reason and was saddened to see it had crashed the following day.<p>Here&#x27;s to hoping this speaks to progress in this regard.<p>(Speaking from OS X)",1431824361

They&#x27;re different things. Money is just created to reflect wealth: it&#x27;s literally just invented by your government (or, in the case of Bitcoin, just by proven work).

I hear these criticisms a lot, and I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of people who appeal to these simplifications to support a particular political belief, but from what I have read of modern economics (including some heterodox schools), economists don&#x27;t operate under these assumptions. The criticisms get more bizarre throughout the article:<p>> Economists create this problem with their insistence on studying mythical creatures often known as Homo economicus. ... An Econ would not expect a gift on the day of the year in which she happened to get married, or be born.<p>That example doesn&#x27;t even make sense in the context of the Homo economicus criticisms.

But it doesn&#x27;t mention how government agencies have targeted drones, genetic tests (23andMe), 3D printing (DD), Uber and Lyft (in some states), Tesla (dealer sales), Airbnb (in some cities), Bitcoin (FinCEN), etc. The reporter mentions Spotify and Netflix as companies that benefit from regulation, which is false; they benefit from <i>copyright law</i>. The thing is you can have copyright law without FCC/SEC-style top-down rate-setting regulation (US copyright law predated the FCC/SEC by over a century).<p>Third, the reporter mentions Balaji Srinivasan of Andreessen Horowitz, but neglects to say whether he changed his mind and is &quot;letting go.&quot; I heard Srinivasan speak three days ago in Palo Alto, and I suspect he hasn&#x27;t. The reporter quotes YC&#x27;s own Sam Altman as speaking dismissively about seasteading, but never said he&#x27;s changed his mind (as far as I know Altman always held that opinion). You might as well quote Democrats talking about Hillary Clinton one day and Republicans the next and claim Americans are &quot;letting go&quot; of that presidential candidate.<p>Maybe seasteads will never happen, maybe the darknet will never be robust, maybe we&#x27;ll never get to Mars, and maybe there&#x27;s a case to be made that Silicon Valley is &quot;letting go&quot; of these dreams. But this article failed to make it.",1431821515

Condoms do allow you to have sex &quot;pointlessly&quot;, ie. with no resulting children, does that make condom manufactures &quot;wrong&quot; somehow?

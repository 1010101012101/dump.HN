 People here despise the government because of corruption of the &quot;stealing&quot; kind, and inefficiency. Despite our recent experiment with dictatorship ended in the 80&#x27;s, We have a long road to travel in terms of awareness about the dangers of tirany.
  The government takes the fingerprints of every citizen when we go make our I.D. Cards, for example. No one makes a fuss. Official propaganda is standard practise (how else would one call the government-bought advertisements to raise awareness about its deeds?) Recenty the folks who organize electios are all over the TV with their campaign to take everyone&#x27;s prints (see &quot;inneficiency&quot;) in order to &quot;make our elections even more secure&quot;. Though the last president&#x27;s plans for &quot;social control of the media&quot; were soundly rebutted, it&#x27;s telling that he even thought he could try.

Of course, the Magna Carta is also a precursor.<p>The only thing making the U.S. Constitution unique is that the U.S. was the first major country to be explicitly founded as a Republic, and the first country to overthrow a monarchy. The South American revolutions against Spain were pretty explicit copies of this example - Simon Bolivar, for example, loved Thomas Jefferson, and actually sent his nephew to the University of Virginia. (The Monroe Doctrine was originally about preventing re-colonization of the independent Republics. It&#x27;s too bad the U.S. did so many evil deeds in the Cold War)<p>The two intellectual groups involved in the founding were the Democratic-Republicans, led by Jefferson, and the Federalists, led by Hamilton. The Federalists basically, more conservative and sought a close emulation of Britain, were slightly elitist and monarchist sympathizing, and of course, wanted a strong central government. They elitism eventually proved unpopular, but they kept a stronghold in the Supreme Court with John Marshall (the Jeffersonians opposed Judicial Review)<p>The Jeffersonians were more radical, favoring a weaker federal government and individual rights. Thus they were instrumental in the creation of the Bill of Rights. They tended to favor France and had more diplomatic connection with them. The most radical founding father, Tom Paine, went to France to help the revolution, and narrowly escaped execution in the reign of terror for being a &quot;reactionary&quot;.",1376002513

I have used <a href=""http://hackerwebapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerwebapp.com/</a> on my iPhone for a while now, but I will put this in rotation to see how they compare. At first glance, they seem very similar and equally slick. A few comments/suggestions based on my experience on iPhone 5 iOS 6 Safari (presuming that OP is the creator, or the creator is in this thread somewhere):<p>When I collapse a comment, I think all subcomments should disappear as well. However, I understand that there are valid use cases for both behaviors. Maybe you could work both functionalities into the UI?<p>I don&#x27;t think you should be pushing onto the history stack every time I toggle between Article and Comments view. It&#x27;s weird that if I toggle 5 times, I have to click the back button in the top left 5 times to get back to the main news feed. That back button should probably just always go straight back to the main news feed view.<p>I encountered bugs trying to highlight text on comments. When I press and hold on a word, the word highlights as expected, but when I then release my touch, it registers a click, which then collapses the entire comment I was trying to highlight. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how Safari passes DOM events, but there&#x27;s probably a way for you to identify &quot;long clicks&quot; and ignore them.<p>Several of the loading spinners you show over buttons are awkwardly positioned. It looks like you place the spinner precisely on the pixel I clicked. It would be nicer to center it over the button I clicked.<p>The article view screwed up on a lot of articles, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware of that. :)",1376002301

They wanted to reduce costs and issues with log files were the top reasons for getting called to support the service.  The government needed to demonstrate that someone had accessed the service 14 days ago, and the government could not understand why the &#x27;minimum&#x27; of 30-day access logs were not present.  I think something else was missing, too.  There was a back-and-forth, and since the company couldn&#x27;t produce the logs as requested the government got a contempt of court with the understanding that the director would be demoted to an IC and not be anywhere near the production service.

  Yes, even just reading it seems much clearer since the mutability, 
  lifetime and ownership of each value and reference is spelled out, not 
  just &quot;some Foo* that you have to remember special validity rules about&quot;.

Given that attaining expertise requires about 10 years of ""deliberate practice"" under the supervision of a capable coach, the deficiencies in India's sports management come under focus:\n1. The lack of native coaches is evident from the need to depend on foreign coaches. This leads to obvious challenges for an aspiring sportsperson. For instance, many potential sports persons may just not be talent-spotted.\n2.

Just because something's popular doesn't mean it can grow forever. Had all those investors realized that Facebook was a one trick pony they might not have lost 40% of their money (and counting...).<p>They had all these visions of grandeur that Facebook could plug various services to their existing users and make endless amounts of money. Maybe add a Facebook classified ads service, document sharing service, auction site, shopping e-store for its members that takes a small commission. Whatever other companies did, just copy it and add it on Facebook and watch users instantly abandon competitors. After all FB has close to a billion users. Little did they know that Facebook users were never that engaged nor will they ever be.<p>The collective hive mind of bored humans completely ignored Facebook Questions. Zuckerberg's first attempt at trying to cultivate its legion of human potatoes. He quickly pulled FB Questions after no one used it and tried again later by changing it to Ask Questions and shoving it right after the ""Add Photo/Video"" link above the status update box itself. People are still ignoring it. Its members are there to share photos and talk to friends, not seek knowledge, not sell photos, not start businesses, not buy digital products, not share documents, or anything else productive or profitable for that matter.<p>In general users follow the ""One website per one purpose"" rule. Auction site neanderthal, eBay learned that the hard way when it simply tried to tack on classified ads thinking its members would ditch craigslist. Even monopolistic cro-magnon Microsoft has tried and failed numerous times at getting its installed base to use more profitable tacked on services and products. Ironically they only succeeded in spreading the worst internet browser in human history this way. Facebook's still in denial about it's useless network of potatoes. Sorry. Humans.<p>After all these years Silicon Valley still values massive droves of bored users without problems over clusters of customers with money in hand. In some ways they're right, Facebook still makes massive amounts of ad revenue and is still profitable. But I doubt it'll experience any further population boom or miraculous revenue growth.<p>The company isn't going anywhere for now, but as Facebook fatigue sets in and members find new and easier ways to share photos with friends (a user's main activity) things might not always be ""flowers and sunshine"" for FB.

Mail is too slow, and not dynamic. Built keeping in regard the 1970s architecture. Chat(Gchat) is too temporary. It is more for casual chit-chat rather than proper discussions that would happen in say, office boardrooms. Facebook is for social, and is not a good medium to do intellectual discussions. Also, it is limited to facebook friends. Even Gchat is limited to people who share a certain level of comfort. I also don't have the email ID of everyone I want to discuss with. Twitter is too short. Its more like advertising than proper discussions.<p>The solution.\nThus, I have an idea of making a website which would allow you to discuss with anyone, people in or out of your friend list, google contacts.

A small flick of switch could make this public, which then would make this website to discussions what quora is for questions/answers.<p>Quora has been an inspiration for this idea.

Using SMPP or any other ""enterprise-grade"" protocol possibly means connecting to telcos directly - and believe me, it's an expensive path to go..<p>Anyway, if you still want to go with SMPP, feel free to contact me, if you require paid assistance (I'm a freelancer). spiritus [dot] emortus [at] gmail [dot] com",1344089545

In my entire time there, I saw perhaps 3-4 Indians running, and considerably more foreigners. The Pune running club was comprised primarily of people who spent time overseas and expats.<p>During a conversation with an auto driver, he told me that Indian's don't do ""poses"" (i.e., yoga) - ""that stuff is just for tourists"".

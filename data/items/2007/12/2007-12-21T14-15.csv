91731,comment,91575,91575,0,0,jdavid,,,"I have always heard that it depends on what type of company you are.<p>Service based companies will trade at less than 1x yearly revenue.  An example of this is if you were to sell a consulting business.<p>Product based companies will trade somewhere at 2-10x annual revenue.  This is like  a toy company.<p>Product based service companies like Netflix seem to trade at 10x plus depending on the stickyness of your service and how much lock in you have.  Netflix offers monthly subscriptions, where your site is based purely on advertising which may have better adoption rates, but lower buy in rates.<p>The lack of customer buy in is a huge problem with many web2 ad supported business models.<p>Salesforce.com has amazing buy in, it changes your company culture when you start using the software, plus you pay yearly for it.",1198248595

Put up ads for ""10 minute mail"", ""5 minute mail"", ""30 minute mail"", and ""42 minute mail"", and see which one gets the most clicks.<p>I heard Tim Ferriss claim that this is how he picked the title for his book, ""The Four-Hour Workweek"".<p>On the other hand, you could also just pull 10 minutes out of the air and say ""that sounds about right"". Which it does.",1198248103

You can then look up their web traffic at Alexa, and look up that of their competitors.  Hand wave a ratio between the two,and assume that the competitors have the same ratio.<p>Google the business press for interviews with founders, and press releases.  <p>Find industry wide statistics (""hunting is a 12 gazillion dollar per year industry"").<p>Call up a wholesaler who sells to the competition and say that you're thinking of launching a firm, and you want to know the process to purchase from them, and what their maximum discount tier is.  Chat with the new accounts rep and ask how many folks qualify for that top tier.  If you're  thinking about selling shovels online, and Shovel Wholesaler Inc. has a maximum discount tier of 40% off retail for $1 million/yr in purchases, and they let drop that ""just two or three"" retailers qualify for that tier, then you can figure out that shovels.com, allshovels.com, and ishovels.com (the three biggest retailers) likely come in at 1.5, 2, and 4 million per year (or something like that...if the top seller was a light year ahead, they would have negotiated a higher tier).<p>Although I've not used this approach, you can call up SCORE and see if anyone there has info.<p>Ping your network on LinkedIn for contacts with info.<p>I note that your example (gamefly, netflix) is one that I've actually done, because one of my two firms (SmartFlix) is in this space.  Their numbers were easy to get from the SEC. I've got a spreadsheet comparing all of their financial ratios to ours (cost of customer acquisition, lifetime value, revenue, profit, revenue per employee, etc., etc., etc.).<p>Never before in the history of mankind has it been as easy to get info on competitors.<p>Put on your Sherlock Holmes hat, pop that pipe in, and get to work!",1198248059

Docstoc is targeting the legal world and form documents, while Scribd is targeting publishers. Both are reluctant industries, so I think whichever one gains traction in the industry will be a victor.",1198246734

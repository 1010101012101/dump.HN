There is strong social pressure from a lot of minority groups for people who ""belong"" to the group to conform to certain social expectations with regard to the group. If they don't, they're often seen as essentially race traitors, and there's lots of abuse directed at them. This is even true for non-physically-noticeable subgroups, e.g. Russian-Americans who choose not to associate with the Russian-American community or its institutions, but it's worse for people who are visibly part of a subgroup that they choose not to be an active part of.",1267833556

A lot of people that belong to a minority clearly see value in services that target their niche, and it's very difficult to explain this to people that don't.<p>There is an ocean of difference between targeting a niche, and discriminating a group. A race-specific bar, i.e. one that targets a race or culture or nationality or sexuality is perfectly ok. Denying service to a group is not ok, that's discrimination, but that's not what we're talking about here. The niche dating sites we were discussing aren't discriminating, they're targeting a niche, and that has to be ok.<p><i>No, because dating is entirely about sexual orientation. Straight men date straight women. Gay men date gay men. And so on. When it comes to race, however, that argument doesn't hold up.</i><p>Yes it does, because dating is about physical attraction for most people, and unless you are extremely desperate, you have physical preferences. Some people likes blondes. Some people like brunettes. Some people like black hair. Is that bad? Some people like whites, some people like blacks, some people like asians. Is that bad? Is that racism? Should we condemn it? How?!?<p>And since some people have those preferences, why not have niche dating sites that caters to them?",1267832551

I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but keep in mind that I am talking <i>specifically</i> about conversations about <i>meaningful</i> things. So in order to avoid speaking dis-respectfully, I avoid these conversations if the other persons can't handle them.<p>When I say meaningful, I mostly mean things that can be dissected into components and analyzed using logic. It is painful to listen to some people talk about quantum mechanics, or even movies or books. They find a conclusion too soon, instead of relishing the antecedent ideas and facts. It takes the human power of inference to examine these preceding, and surrounding, ideas and to connect them in a way that makes sense (this is that human thing that I am respecting in my first paragraph, btw).  And, it often takes more than one brain to do this well.<p>Okay, the problem is a little clearer: I am much more interested in the process of finding a precise conclusion than weighing the conclusion itself against another person's. I get the impression that most people perceive it as some kind of battle.<p>Also, keep in mind, I was talking specifically about laypeople, whose attitude is normally this: ""don't mess with my opinion. That is sacred territory."" And I am speaking about laypeople because they are the majority and tend to decide these social norms.<p>This is why I <i>don't</i> talk to them about meaningful things. It is too much like a minefield, where I'm talking myself in circles trying to avoid upsetting the other person. Think about talking to a fundamentalist christian about evolution, but you have to do it in a way that wont upset them. A layperson's thought process is jacked up just like that fundamentalist's. And it shows in how they want to speak to one another.<p>Again, that is why I choose not to engage in discussion about meaningful things with these people. I keep my head by engaging them with charm, humor, wit, anecdotes.... which is fine exercise and I'm rather good at it. I'm not a non-functioning nerd; I know tact very well.<p>I don't like it like this, but I accept it. I want to be able to talk to anybody about important things.<p>It's a good thing that I've picked good close friends and partners who know how to communicate well, and we never play the ""you're not allowed to say that card,"" or the ""you're not allowed to omit that card"" hahaha. Funny how we never manipulate, lie, or have terrible arguments with one-another and yet people who uphold bad communication and these silly social pleasantries, their lives are wrought with unnecessary drama.<p>Please, let me know if there was anything else you would like for me to clarify.

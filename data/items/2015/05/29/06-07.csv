9623138,comment,9622949,9622949,0,0,contingencies,,,"Historical and geographical context of Japanese <i>ramen</i> from a Chinese cultural perspective: <i>ra</i> part is derived from 拉 (Mandarin <i>la</i>) which means pulled and refers to the process of making the noodles, the <i>men</i> part is derived from 麺 (Mandarin <i>mian</i>) which is the traditional Chinese character for noodles (面 is the simplified form). In modern China, this 麺/面 normally describes long-form wheat noodles however other types of wheat noodles (such as knife-cut noodles), egg noodles, various bean noodles and rice noodles are also popular and some of them are described with the same character. However, many are produced using alternate methods such as squashing through a press or manually slicing a large, pancake-like, thin, often doubled-over piece of noodle material in to noodle-like strands, or by cutting chunks off a block of dough. China has a lot of noodle traditions, probably (logically for its size and population) far more than Japan. Personally I&#x27;m a fan of 米干 or <i>mi gan</i> which is a Tai-style broad flat fresh rice noodle normally prepared in the southwest and 刀削面 (<i>dao xue mian</i>) or knife-cut noodles which hail from north-western China. Modern  mainland China&#x27;s instant noodle tradition, probably partly re-inspired by Japan&#x27;s (possibly via Hong Kong) is known as 方便面 (<i>fangbian mian</i>) or &#x27;convenience noodles&#x27;. A Taiwanese academic take on this whole thing would be interesting.<p>Note that the Wikipedia page for Ramen[1] is laughable in claiming the origin of ramen is unclear. It&#x27;s clearly Chinese. Interestingly however, it claims the Japanese only began to use the term <i>ramen</i> after the 1950s, ie. after they invaded China, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam (all but Korea being huge noodle consumers). Previously the Japanese used other terms which directly attributed the tradition to China. While there is apparently no clear evidence, one could reliably assume that Buddhist monks and other travelers around the Nara period[2] would have brought knowledge of Chinese and Central Asian foodstuffs back to Japan from post Silk Road China.<p>As a postscript to be fair (borrowing happens in many directions!), so-called Chinese <i>baozi</i> (包子) or steamed buns are actually Turkic in origin, as attributed by surviving Yuan Dynasty cookbooks (see also Jewish, Polish, Russian, Tibetan traditions). The same sources include an early recipe for <i>baklavah</i> which has since died out in China... probably in the anti-foreign repression following the Mongol Yuan Dynasty at the dawn of the Ming, which incidentally was when Zhenghe sailed his great Chinese fleet to Southeast Asia and Africa. Also, some people claim Italy&#x27;s noodle tradition is a post-Marco Polo thing (who, some credible evidence attests, was actually from the now Croatian island of Dubrovnik, under the sway of the piratical Venetian empire but not &#x27;Italian&#x27; per-se).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen#History</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanto_Rikush%C5%AB"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanto_Rikush%C5%AB</a>",1432882774

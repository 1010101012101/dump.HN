Apple ended up being stuck with Motorola&#x27;s inablity to deliver faster PowerPC chips. Whole product lines were delayed, or not possible. Effectively they gave control on when they could ship new product to a third party.<p>10 years later they are now in the same position with Intel. If Intel delays the next version of its product line by six months then Apple has to put things on hold. This is bad for a company like Apple as it could cause them to miss out on potentially lucrative periods (back to School, the Holiday season etc).<p>Ultimately I suspect in the very near term we will see Apple move off Intel, first for the laptops. LLVM IR would fit this strategy better than fat binaries as Apple would not have to wait until developers recompile.

Light rail is rarely as economical of a solution as many suggest simply because of the routes it has to take in some cities and going underground just raises the cost exponentially. The cost per mile to develop and maintain rarely comes even close to efficient of above ground solutions.  Portland is looking to spend two billion on a line simply because it does go underground. There is no possible pay back.<p>So don&#x27;t discount bus service and other alternatives. This romance with rail, either above or below ground, sucks up way too much funding for what it delivers.",1441796632

Things get popular for lots of reasons heavily affected by the shape of social networks and early choices by a small number of people involved—often based on what they have and have not heard of more than an analysis of what is better or worse. Quality plays a small role at best.<p>This Nautil.us article[1] does a good job of summarizing the relevant research on the issue and references some supporting studies.<p>> <i>My own research has shown that fame has much less to do with intrinsic quality than we believe it does, and much more to do with the characteristics of the people among whom fame spreads.</i><p>Put another way: the web has a direct impact on billions of people less because it&#x27;s any good and more because popularity is inherently a power law and it happened to come out ahead. This doesn&#x27;t invalidate any criticisms of quality!<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible if not likely for something popular to be crappy because most things are crappy and that&#x27;s not enough to stop them from getting popular. Then they require tons of engineering effort and hacks to scale and improve again not because of quality but because of legacy. The web is what&#x27;s there already, after all!<p>That&#x27;s how things are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s inevitable or a good state of affairs.<p>I really wish people wouldn&#x27;t conflate popularity, quality and success.

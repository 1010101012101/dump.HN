Would you use it?",,"For the past months I have been working on what's going to be a stand-alone PHP xdebug debugger app, the first one to actually implement pretty much all the features that an IDE debugger has but without the heavy resources usage, and actually fun to use.<p>Here's a screenshot of the work so far: http://imgur.com/hP9pF bare in mind that this is still a work in progress and I have yet to finish some features and interface design.<p>What it currently does:<p>- You can use it by just enter ""xdebug_break()"" in your code. It will automatically get your source code and stack, and u are ready to go.<p>- OR you can just Set/remove breakpoints like a regular debugger<p>- Change variables at runtime<p>- Eval<p>- File map to your local folders in case you don't want it to download the remote source code<p>- Editor with themes<p>So what do you think guys ?
Is this something you would like to use instead of an IDE debugger ? 
I know this is just a screenshot but it's no ready for sale yet.<p>I'm expecting to have RC by the end of the month, with a new polished layout (working on it atm) and bug free.<p>I also need some beta testers in case anyone is interested.

For starters, if someone uses a hidden camera to photograph or videotape a kid taking a bath, then that can't possibly cause any physical or emotional harm to the kid, because the camera does not physically act on the kid in any observable way, and the kid is not aware of it.  Next, even if the kid is aware of the camera, she may not care and may forget about it.  Going further, if the grown-up tells the kid to wear some ""sexy"" outfit and to pose in a certain way, the kid may be persuaded that it's just a silly little game.  (Note that kids are already put through unpleasant or painful experiences against their will when, for example, told to sit still while the doctor swabs their arm and gives them a shot, or told to eat ""healthy"" foods they dislike.  If you think any of the above causes serious emotional harm, then you should be gasping with rage when you see most doctors and parents.)  This wide range of pictures would probably all be classified as child pornography.<p>Perhaps you'll say, ""What I <i>meant</i> was brutally raping a child and videotaping that!""  Well, unfortunately, that's not what the laws cover, and, unfortunately, the laws are what we're talking about.  Whether a child was injured in the creation of the media is not mentioned in the laws governing child pornography.<p>Furthermore, even in the brutal-rape case, the child is not harmed when a third party makes copies of the video.  Or even when the rapist makes copies of the video.  ...I mean, jesus freaking christ, I agree with punishing the rapist, but the crime is not ""possessing videotapes of a child"", or even ""videotaping a child"", the crime is ""brutally raping a child""!  Grr, the mind-boggling wrongness of it all is making me mad.<p>Anyway.  The poster I was responding to was objecting to virtual child porn--that which is created by an artist and involves no actual children.  (So, actually, your objection is <i>completely</i> irrelevant, although it is relevant to the more general argument, so I responded to it anyway.)  He seemed to be arguing that the act of watching (or looking at or otherwise consuming) child porn--unrelated to its production--to aid in the construction of a pedophile's fantasy scenario was a bad thing, because it's bad to fantasize about horrible insane things--and would probably say that, therefore, the possession of child pornography (virtual or otherwise) should be illegal, because people who consume it are dangers to society.<p>I emphatically objected to the ""it's bad to fantasize about horrible insane things, and to create media that aid in such fantasy"" on its own terms.  I would also object to the ""dangerous, therefore possession should be illegal"" thing: I might observe that people who read the Communist Manifesto are more likely to commit acts of terrorism as a result, or that husbands who drink alcohol are more likely to beat their wives as a result, but I would oppose anyone who tried to ban any of the above.<p><i>If this is the case they why has there not ever been a single case of this happening?</i><p>I googled [teenagers sexting sex offender].  <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=teenagers+sexting+sex+offender&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=...</a>

4499688,comment,4498507,4498507,14,0,tHNrowaway,,,"I've got to agree with most everything here.  Porn messed up a large number of my relationships in university.<p>I'm just under 30.  When I was a teen, almost everyone around me had broadband (well, DSL).  My family had dialup.  So no internet porn for me.  My father/mother did not have a stash nor did any of my friends.  So no VHS porn.  Somehow I managed to never watch porn during my secondary school years.  I did do a lot of reading though.  Alt.sex.stories was nice back then.<p>At university I got real internet, but still did not watch porn. (Roommates.)  I did however start dating.  These girls had seen porn.  Lots of it, compared to me.  It was odd, because they'd ask me to do things I found completely disgusting.  (Voyeurism, anal, simulated rape.)  The same girls would refuse to do things I thought deeply compassionate.  (Oral sex was more appealing to me than straight sex.)<p>It was not until after school when I got my own place that I finally watched some porn and finally made the connection.  All mainstream porn is horrid.  At a most basic level it is about one thing and one thing only - giving the viewer something to look at.<p>The fundamental issue here is that for flesh to be seen, it has to have an unblocked line to the camera.  If it is unblocked, no one can be touching it.  If no one is touching it, it is being neglected and someone is not having as good a time as they could be.  Nothing happens in porn because it feels good, only because it looks ""good"".  You end up with truly ridiculous sex in porn where there is no physical contact between the two parties except at the genitalia.  And even that is kept at a minimum!  (I could provide specific if requested, but given my literary upbringing they might be a little too detailed and graphic for this forum ;)<p>It is about as bad as hackers on TV where they are using two keyboards simultaneously while a projector plasters their face with scrolling text.  Sure looks impressive, but it just can not work that way.",1347284492

This is a really interesting hook and I would definitely read more as I love donating to people who actually make a difference.<p>3. On the front page you quote some alarmingly large numbers that made me think of the following quote => ""The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.""  Perhaps you can focus on a few of the cases you have already helped.<p>4. Following up to number 3, please tell us how many lives you have positively affected.<p>5. Eradicating preventable blindness if a big goal and hard to get my head around.  If there a specific surgery that Dr. Nitin Pandya focuses on?  By sharing and focusing on that specific patient issue it's easier to grasp and helps know that even a little bit of help will go a really long way.<p>6. On the right hand side you have a paypal donate button.  I would put the message you have beneath the button ""SAVE A SIGHT, CHANGE A LIFE
Make a gift of sight"" above the button as that way I have a better motivator to donate.<p>7. Per earlier points, maybe the message ""SAVE A SIGHT, CHANGE A LIFE
Make a gift of sight"" could be tightened to something that is way more specific either regarding surgery or individual patients.<p>8. Talk more about cataracts in first world countries verus third world countries.  Help me understand why this is such an important problem to solve and why my donation will actually make a difference.<p>9.

  so close to simulating consciousness. and this part: ""In quantum 
  mechanics, particles do not have a definite state unless theyre 
  being observed."" is that true? That blew my mind.
</code></pre>
I'm not sure if its superfluous to even state this here on HN, but I feel compelled to: We are <i>not</i> ""close"" to simulating consciousness, and the whole quantum thing doesn't actually work like you've been led to believe.<p>First of all, there is a whole spectrum of simulation software to consider. The most Matrix-like method is a direct 3D game-like environment with really good graphics where many parameters of our current environment are hard-coded and everything is executed with the human inhabitant in mind. This is probably close to what the article is trying to invoke if for no other reason than ""it's easy to understand"". It's also the one which least conforms to our observations. If the universe is being simulated, it's more likely a bottom-up simulation where things like planets, plants, and eventually people simply emerge instead of being designed outright. For all intents and purposes, such a universe would be indistinguishable from a ""natural"" one, so much so it's bordering on pointlessness even arguing about it.<p>Second, simulating consciousness (or rather more precisely: designing and running human-like minds on a digital substrate) directly is not something we're particularly close to. We are still missing important engineering details about human brains to recreate them, and likewise generalised AGI research also has some gaps in understanding how to build advanced problem solving machines. Depending on the chosen method of ""simulation"", from full no-shortcuts whole brain emulation probably being the most expensive to fast and memory-optimised non-human AGI being the more efficient, we might already have enough raw computing power to drive a mind using just a couple of desktop computers. What we're missing though is the right software.<p>I'm also getting really tired about this whole ""observer"" misunderstanding whenever quantum physics is invoked. I can't help but feel this was an intentional consequence when they chose their terminology. To this day it remains a poor choice of wording. The agenda behind this might not only be designed to sell books to New Age lunatics, but also to enable pseudo-religious excursions undertaken by otherwise respectable scientists such as Penrose.",1347282800

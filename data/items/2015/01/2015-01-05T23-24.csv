8842093,comment,8839194,8841069,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re not a front-end developer so forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong, but what you&#x27;re saying is absurd. It is hard.</i><p>I suspect that we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree on that. I&#x27;d say building a real-time control system for an aircraft is hard. Writing safety-critical firmware for a medical device that must have literally no serious bugs because if you miss one then people could actually die is hard. Accurately modelling global weather patterns is hard. Building a database that can support Google or Facebook or global financial systems is hard. Writing networking algorithms that can manipulate hundreds of gigabits per second of network traffic on today&#x27;s commodity hardware is hard. Performing voice recognition and natural language processing to allow a computer to respond to verbal commands in everyday language is hard.<p>In contrast, writing a relatively small, primarily text/form-based UI as a front-end to simple database is not hard, whether as a desktop app, or a mobile app, or a web app. It just isn&#x27;t. There are no out-of-the-ordinary performance requirements. No-one is going to die or lose a million dollars per hour if it has a bug. There&#x27;s no fundamental problem to solve that requires the development of new algorithms. It&#x27;s like 2/10 on the scale of hard software problems.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you started your post by talking about assumptions underlying frameworks changing and you kept coming back to the 5 year time scale. As I see it, the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JS haven&#x27;t really changed very much in two decades. Likewise, the patterns we see in modern web and mobile UIs -- things like data binding, and MV*, and bundling updates together so you only do one expensive re-render -- have been widely used in desktop software for decades as well. So I&#x27;m wondering what fundamental assumptions could have changed so much in just a few years that a JS framework would no longer be useful so quickly, and I&#x27;m thinking maybe they were bad assumptions in the first place.<p>Of course a few of the details have evolved over time. And of course it&#x27;s nice that there are now JS libraries to support some of those patterns as a ready-made tool so we don&#x27;t have to set them up ourselves. Still, we&#x27;ve been using the same ideas, even in front-end web development, since long before Angular or React was on the scene. Implementing those patterns in JS using general programming principles isn&#x27;t difficult, nor is it particularly time-consuming, given that you probably build these kinds of tools once per project and we&#x27;re talking about projects large and important enough to have a multi-year lifespan. Much of the JS community for the past few years has just been kind of flailing around learning the same old lessons all over again, with varying degrees of success.<p>So I&#x27;m puzzled by this recurring idea in discussions about JS frameworks that all we could do before we had the likes of Angular and React was store data in the DOM and use arbitrarily large amounts of trivial jQuery. That is not a world I recognise. No doubt quite a few sites/apps did work like that; there are plenty of low-skilled people who write software, after all. But plenty of other sites/apps were built by real software developers who used real software design skills, just like any other programming project. Right now, I&#x27;m working professionally on multiple web front-ends that predate most or all of these JS frameworks, yet have been doing their job and adapting to changing requirements successfully for longer than anything written in those frameworks has been around. They each have their own considered software design, and they still use techniques like publish-subscribe, bundled rendering updates, separate models, and so on.<p>So as I said at the beginning, I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;ll just have to agree to disagree. I can&#x27;t accept the premise that building a typical UI that is mostly text/forms and talks to a database is difficult to do without a framework. Countless programmers have been doing it on numerous different platforms for decades. It&#x27;s just that a significant part of the JS community only just noticed and started borrowing the same ideas.",1420502351

A good taxi driver optimizes the ride in order to maximize their fares. The more runs a driver can make between downtown and the airport, for example, the greater their income will be. Besides which, if tips impact the route the driver takes then passengers ought to tip up-front to avoid being &quot;taken for a ride&quot;.

Instead of adapting two different classes to work together, a monad&#x27;s for extending a type to add new behavior.<p>Think of something like Java&#x27;s Iterable<T>.  It takes a type T, and extends it with the concept of a sequence of items. It also gives you all sorts of extra goodies for doing useful stuff with sequences such a function to transform from a sequence of one type to a sequence of another (Iterables.transform) and Iterables.concat, which takes two instances of Iterable<T> and concatenates them.<p>This is close to, but not quite, what a monad really does.  To get all the way there you&#x27;d want to have a function called Iterables.transformAndConcat() with a signature roughly like this:<p><pre><code>    Iterable<T> transformAndConcat(Iterable<F> from, Function<F,Iterable<T>> func)
</code></pre>
It differs from basic transform because the function it takes maps from F to Iterable<T> rather than simply from F to T.  It uses that to get a set of Iterable<T> that it then concatenates to produce the final output.<p>This ends up being a really powerful function.  It can be used to do all sorts of things, including replacing the behavior of both transform (by supplying a function that always returns an iterable of length 1 for every input) and concat (by supplying an identity function).  More generally, it lets you take functions that take some input and output an Iterable of some type and compose them to produce more complex behaviors.<p>As a more expansive example of the concept&#x27;s power, even for OO languages, let&#x27;s skip over to the other managed platform: A version of this function (in this case called SelectMany) forms the core of .NET&#x27;s LINQ library.  LINQ&#x27;s query syntax includes facilities for all sorts of SQL-style querying, including grouping and joins, and virtually all of it ends up being compiled down to calls to SelectMany().  In turn, this means that if you&#x27;re writing code in C#, you can the query syntax with any generic class that conforms to a few rules, including having an implementation of SelectMany().",1420500364

Yeah, our docs need some love :)<p>It&#x27;s totally seamless, so as soon as you run a test we allocate (multiple) human testers automatically and your results come back within 30 mins on average. The median time to being allocated a first tester for a test is (in the last 30 days) is 2min 29s.<p>We have a massive crowd of testers available, so in general response time is fairly consistent.<p>The majority of our tech is on the backend for scoring and sorting results and testers. There&#x27;s a bunch of sorting that happens in the background between a tester submitting a &#x27;result&#x27; and Rainforest verifying that result and returning it to the customer.<p>Does that answer your questions?",1383595165

Originally this would elicit nothing more than a grunt of frustration as I fumbled for the F12 key; Firefox&#x27;s own tools were simply far too primitive to bother with (though I couldn&#x27;t help but notice how much more responsive they were than Firebug). But as the months wore on and features accumulated (&quot;a network panel, <i>finally!</i>&quot;), I found myself bothering to correct my error less and less frequently. Just today, in fact, I realized that I had happily spent all morning in the built-in tools without ever yearning for Firebug.<p>That said, there are still lots of things that Firebug still does better (more convenient object inspection in the console, for one). But the built-ins launch <i>so much damn faster</i> and keep my general browsing experience so much more responsive that it&#x27;s starting to get difficult to justify having Firebug installed at all.<p>Hey Firefox dev tools team: nice work.

Afterwards we were trying to come up with things to disrupt with a super low power / massively parallel chip like that. The problem he brought up is that in products like smart phones the power usage is in the display and the radio. So there isn&#x27;t much savings in a lower power processor.<p>But...

I wrote this program for Android in just 2 weeks, in after-work hours. It is a Qt Quick 2.1 app based on ApplicationWindow with a few C++ fragments injected. This program is intended to help develop QML components right on your mobile device.<p>Really, this app is not designed to be used for serious development. Rather, it is a fan project for Qt lovers like myself. I often found the need, in the absence of a desktop computer, to show QML&#x27;s advantages to programers who haven&#x27;t yet had a chance to appreciate declarative programming. Or, alternatively, if you want to develop QML components and just don&#x27;t have a desktop around, now you can do it anywhere you like on your mobile device.<p>The first release includes 5 examples and all the functionality of Qt Quick 2.1. In the near future, I&#x27;m going to finish the code highlighting (it&#x27;s not really working right now, sorry) and also build in some editor skins. Naturally, I&#x27;ll give you some more examples. And upgrade to 5.2:)<p>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wearyinside.qmlcreator",1383594538

But it&#x27;s based on Market Forces which drives value rather than 100% random (or corrupt) forces.<p>However to say people should be payed based on the percent yield. Most people consider only physical value in looking at labor. I imagine you would believe that someone working for a corporation carving blocks into a statue should be payed a percentage of that sale of the statue.<p>Yet it&#x27;s obvious that that line of thinking (physical value only) is incorrect. How much would you pay doctors? Doctors don&#x27;t create anything, but they generate value by instructing surgeons, nurses, etc on what they should do. By physical value only, coal miners would make hundreds, doctors 0.<p>Okay, so we concede that intellectual value should be also considered in the percentage yield owed to an individual.<p>Then that brings us a really good CEO. Per product, a good CEO might only cost a fraction of a cent. You can calculate finding a number of sales of a product and dividing into it the CEOs billion $ salery.  A bad CEO might make an OK on a failed product that costs the company 5 cents a product. This costs him billions of dollars of his own money. A really good CEO might one day decide to test a method of production, or a new mass production strategy that decreases cost of making each good by 10 cents. He is payed hundreds of Billions. You might agree that based on this, it <i>would</i> make sense to pay CEOs based on output, but once you realize that the good CEO and bad CEO are the often same person, and once you charge a person hundreds of billion of dollars for their 5 cent mistake, they would have make the risk needed to gain the the 10c discovery, you might begin to understand that CEOs simply cannot be payed based on this method of value.<p>Okay so we try the opposite approach. It&#x27;s based on luck so we should pay everyone the same. No one would want to take on the stress for a low-power, high risk, boring job like supervising a reactor core. Especially since that job pays the same as a fun job like stopping crime, or something more interesting and easy to get into. There would be a constant problem of not enough people in some jobs and too many in others. Redistributing people would be completely random and people would be placed in to jobs they hate, and paid the same amount as people doing jobs they would love. So here, much more people are unhappy, and incompetence is all around. (Then some guy says he&#x27;s going to fix it and everyone rallies around him and soon dictatorship).",1383594378

6670656,comment,6669456,6670371,3,0,tmhedberg,,,"The win for Haskell is that it wears its statefulness on its sleeve. Of course you can, with sufficient discipline, write pure code in any language, though it can be frustratingly difficult in languages where libraries make idiomatic use of mutation. And yes, you can also write impure code in Haskell, at least for some definitions of &quot;impure&quot;.<p>What you can&#x27;t do in Haskell is write impure code that claims to be pure (up to the customarily and idiomatically avoided `unsafePerformIO`), or write code whose degree of statefulness is ambiguous. Reliable, explicit, and statically enforced purity holds more than just theoretical benefits. I don&#x27;t have to read through library code to see if it is thread-safe. I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether passing a data structure to a library function will result in that structure being mutated behind my back. I don&#x27;t have to trust code comments that may not be in sync with the current state of the code. Simply by virtue of the fact that a function does not mention `IO` in its type, I can have total confidence that it won&#x27;t violate my assumptions about its behavior. And I don&#x27;t even have to take it on faith that the author wrote the correct type for his code; if he hadn&#x27;t, the compiler would have rejected it. This is the difference between &quot;pure by convention&quot; and &quot;provably pure&quot;.<p>Every language must necessarily have an &quot;IO monad&quot; and interact with the inherently stateful world, or else it is useless. Haskell is different not because you can choose to avoid I/O, but because when you do so, the type system will back you up with perfect accuracy.",1383593882

When I saw the answer, it blew my mind at first. Later I understood how it was related to the fact that the harmonic series diverges, and it became less mind blowing, but it&#x27;s still a little mind blowingbecause it&#x27;s still a little mind blowing that the harmonic series diverges.<p>It became one of my favorite puzzles, and I tried it on friends and family. I certainly never thought it could have &quot;real-world&quot; applications.<p>But then it occurred to me, people were solving this puzzle every day.<p>Think of an ordinary loan. Each month, you make a payment that&#x27;s part interest and part principal. At first it&#x27;s mostly interest, then the ratio shifts over time, the final payments being nearly all principal.<p>You normally start with a loan amount (principal), an interest rate, and a loan duration (typically 180 or 360 months). From these parameters, you figure the monthly payment, a process called amortization. Part of the payment goes towards interest, part towards the principal.<p>Each month you&#x27;re required to service the loan, which means to pay (at least) the interest. That&#x27;s the cost of renting the money. Some loan arrangements allow you to pay down the principal at your own pace. If you only ever pay interest, the principal will remain unchanged, and the loan will go on forever. This is the Netflix model: they don&#x27;t care how long you keep a discyou&#x27;re paying rent on it every month. Many people pay more than the monthly payment from time to time. The principal will be reduced by this extra amount.<p>The worm has taken out a loan. The twist is, we don&#x27;t yet know the principal, nor the total amount to be paid, which corresponds to the final rope length. Instead, we know the payment: 1 yard.  The interest portion varies, but the worm consistently pays down the principal 1 inch each pay period.<p>Some of the added yard (monthly payment) appears in front of the worm (interest portion) some behind it (principal portion). Stretching the rope <i>uniformly</i> has the effect of servicing the interest. At first, most of the newly added rope appears in front of the worm, but as with the ordinary loan, the back/front ratio increases over time.<p>That the worm will eventually reach the end of the rope is now evident. If your interest payment is taken care of, then even a small monthly pay-down of the principal will eventually pay off any size loan.",1383593612

now you can check whether integer pair (f1,f2) exists, you can just check whether T[output * r1 * f2 * 2^p / input] is non-zero.
Also, output * r1 * r2 * 2^p has to be divisible by input, so after you iterate over p & r1, you can iterate only over r2&#x27;s being multiples of input / gcd(input, output * r1 * 2^p)<p>There could be possibly some more tricks found.",1383593428

A large part of the problem is that Millenials are disenchanted with what they discover once they get out of college. Where they had expected to be challenged and rewarded and free, they discover that a job is still just a job (in many cases). You&#x27;re expected to show up at a certain time everyday, and put your head down and work hard on tasks which often seem devoid of meaning and intrinsic value. To put it mildly, this reality is a major buzz kill and hard to stomach. The world seems like your oyster in college, and then you discover upon graduation that it is not. You&#x27;re just another cog in a machine so large you cannot fathom how your contributions matter.<p>Millenials are simply discovering this and rejecting it. They don&#x27;t know how, but they want more or of life than just a step above indentured servitude. They want freedom, and to see directly how what they do matters. They don&#x27;t just want a job, they want a calling.<p>The sad truth is that corporations lack the flexibility and forethought in many cases to see the writing on the wall. I suspect that our economy is in for some rocky days ahead--as it is trapped between a rapidly aging workforce willing to work traditional corporate jobs, and new generations who refuse to accept the same. Companies will either need to radically rethink their business from the top down in order to attract and retain valued employees, or die.  Those companies which survive will be those which are asked and responsive not just to their external customers, but also their internal customers (employees). They will need to offer more challenge, non-linear rewards and incentives, and above all freedom: require less hours worked, more flexibility in how and where work can be accomplished, etc. Millenials simply do not want a job where they punch in and out and work forty hours (or more) a week for a paycheck.

6670528,comment,6669456,6670316,2,0,jroesch,,,"I misread your comment, usually people challenge that point. I totally agree that it is difficult to talk about maintainability in an objective fashion, but there is something to be said about having as many of your assumptions in your codebase vs. your test suite. My experiences working in a Ruby code base is that many assumptions have been encoded in the tests, and not notated in the main code base. When those assumptions change there is a large burden on the programmer of having to unify ad-hoc assumptions from both the test cases and main code base. Validating whether those assumptions still hold, or if it is a test from 3 years ago, and has only been vacuously passing.<p>I found working in a big Ruby code base that this required spending a non trivial amount of time unifying the two. In that regard by minimizing the amount of test code one has to write and maintain I would argue that maintainability goes up. I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of FP practitioners boasting about relatively low test to code ratios, while in the Ruby world often times you have at least 2x test code, since often times you even have to validate assumptions like `object.responds_to? :foo`.",1383592660
6670527,comment,6668551,6668551,29,0,chalst,,,"<i>> It is worth pointing out the other gripes I have with (La)TeX at this point. I will probably regret this later (I have the impression TeXies can be quite fanatical)</i><p>Probably.  I applaud efforts to try to rethink typesetting, and this is clearly a substantial accomplishment.  Tex is, however, an outstanding design, both in a number of of its aspects and as an overall design, and a lot of later effort has gone into remedying its limitations.<p><i>> TeX is not transparent. It is a huge, complex system ... With hundreds of megabytes and seemingly millions of files for a typical TeX installation, I have no idea what is going on when TeX processes a document.</i><p>Knuth&#x27;s contribution is, in fact, quite small in terms of Mb.  This covers just the Computer Modern Roman fonts and the eufrak maths fonts, and Plain Tex.  Most of a system such as a full Texlive install is made up of fonts.  It covers a huge number of specialist journal styles, and support for the needs of specialist fields (linguistic glosses, setting code, chemical notations, Feynman diagrams, etc.).  The complexity is that of a library, and kpathsea is its index system.<p>I have the idea that maybe you think a package whose value you don&#x27;t see is fluff: there is fluff in Texlive, but probably much less than you think.<p><i>> The arcane TeX macro language is not accessible to a broad audience. I believe this is why most LaTeX-generated documents you come across have exactly the same (retro) look; very few people are capable of creating new document styles.</i><p>There is a point here, but I think the reason is that most people don&#x27;t want to fuss about with style.  CSS makes it easy to experiment with page styles, and still most web pages either follow a standard formula or look very ugly.  Understanding markup conventions is not usually going to be the biggest obstacle to achieving good design.<p><i>> TeX is not very modern</i><p>There is not a real problem outlined here: you could equally say that the basic layout engine has proven itself by being capable of accommodating all these later technologies.  The Office 2007 team even rewrote its formula layout engine so that it would conform to that described in the Tex book, and employed Knuth as a consultant.<p>I&#x27;d put it this way: Knuth&#x27;s code combines a very deep insight into the nature of the requirements of computer typesetting with outstanding implementation skills.  The basic design has not really been surpassed.<p><i>> TeXs warnings/errors are often very cryptic. It can sometimes take a long time to figure out whats wrong.</i><p>Yes, very much so.  This is probably the best reason to consider alternative document description languages.  But note that Tex is very successful at allowing &quot;code&quot; invocation to be mixed with text - I&#x27;d like to see rivals that challenge Tex on this point.<p><i>> But why do I even need to mess around with all these extension packages when all Im doing is writing a simple article?  Doesnt this mean that LaTeX should include at least some of the most commonly used packages by default?</i><p>The Latex3 team concede this.  Context, a rival Tex-based system, does not have this problem.<p><i>> This might largely be a solved problem by now, but I remember often running into input and font encoding issues with LaTeX in the past.</i><p>Use Xetex or Luatex, and standardise everything on Unicode; these problems go away.<p><i>> There is no strict separation of content and style.</i><p>I&#x27;d put it this way: the system offers the possibility of such a separation, but does not enforce it.  This is bad if you often have to work with other people&#x27;s Latex, although in practice, you learn how to deal with it.<p>Addressing some of the problems raised in <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/128454/are-there-any-open-research-problems-in-the-world-of-tex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/128454/are-there-any-...</a> could be helpful for showing off your design and the advantages of a fresh start.",1383592659

What you do is that you mine like a regular pool. In fact it&#x27;s not a dishonest pool but it&#x27;s called selfish because it acts like a normal pool. Say you find a block, which happens like any other pool. Instead of publishing it, you keep it private. This is the key.<p>Now with enough tries it will happen that you find two blocks in a row - again happens all the time with pools. But what you do is that you wait until the other pools find theirs. Once they find the block (you already found it remember?), or they&#x27;ve wasted many cycles finding it, you publish yours that you&#x27;ve found already.<p>By doing this you kind of selectively publish the blocks you find, wasting other pools cycles and sort of giving you a heads start for the next block search. It&#x27;s all actually about building a pool that selectively publishes blocks so that it can get you a heads start for the next mining cycle. Miners will likely join this selfish pool because they&#x27;ll have a heads start and not feel as though their hashing power is going to waste since it&#x27;s constantly being invalidated by the selfish pool (by publishing blocks at specific times).<p>The paper assumes there&#x27;s only one selfish pool. I presume that if a selfish pool arises, there will also be a variety of other selfish pools arising at the same time. If all pools are acting this way, then there&#x27;s really no incentive for miners to go to any specific pool (avoiding centralization). So it will just be like regular mining again.",1383592187

6670450,comment,6654211,6654211,1,0,jobhopthrowaway,,,"Just wanted to add an additional perspective, lending some weight to a few others here.<p>I assume I&#x27;d be considered a mid-level developer, over 6 years out of school, with a master&#x27;s, though I&#x27;ve been called a &quot;senior software engineer&quot; at times, mostly for billing purposes. I&#x27;ve held 6 positions since school, ranging from 6 months to just over 2 years. I&#x27;ve been in my most recent for about a year and a half, and am considering making another move.<p>In nearly every interview, I get asked about why I&#x27;ve changed jobs so frequently. The 6-month stints have mostly been about culture, other job changes have mostly been boredom or frustration.  Many interviewers have been sympathetic to my issues, and maybe some even see it as a good thing - learning quickly, contributing fast, etc, all look good, especially when you&#x27;re young.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older/deeper into my career, the questions have changed somewhat.  Instead of &quot;why did you leave,&quot; it&#x27;s becoming more of &quot;why do you leave so often? Did you try to work it out with your manager? What assurances do I have that you&#x27;ll stay?&quot; It&#x27;s critical to have solid answers to those questions, assuming you even get in the door.  Unfortunately too, I have gotten passed over several times even for an interview because of it - many employers in my region are either larger (so more traditional views on employee tenures), or very small, so looking for low-churn employees that are willing to make longer-term investments in being more of a &quot;family.&quot; Those smaller companies also tend not to be high-growth or high-margin companies, hence why they tend towards longer-term views.<p>To more directly answer some of your questions, in my experience, the longer your career, the more stability you need to show. Of course this is industry and locale-specific, but at this point, my average of 1-1.1 years/position is becoming detrimental to me, and I think employers are probably looking for 2-3 years.  I have, as has been suggested, dropped a couple of the shorter and less-relevant positions from my resume, both to keep it to one page, but also because as mentioned, a 6 month gap can often hurt you less than a 6 month job.  It&#x27;s also critical to demonstrate a track record of delivering for the client, and doing great things.  You want your resume to say &quot;if you hire me, this is exactly the type of thing I can do for you.&quot;  If you&#x27;re &quot;efficient and seeking challenges&quot; as your question indicated, make sure that you can back up that claim on your resume and interview.<p>Keep in mind as well the type of company you&#x27;re applying at.  Hiring managers at startups and big companies are going to have similar rubrics, as many of the responders below have indicated, but you&#x27;re going to have a different rubric for your satisfaction at these places.  Find a company, big or small, where you will enjoy the type of work you&#x27;re doing, can find projects that you can sink your teeth into and really own, and also can have a good time (all the soft stuff like coworkers, office environment, etc).  Make sure to find one that acknowledges your skills and type of worker you are, and can provide opportunities for rapid growth, tons of learning experiences, and a chance to deliver.  Try to avoid a company where saying &quot;I&#x27;m bored&quot; is going to turn you into a black sheep or flight risk.  Find a company where your manager is interested in your growth as a human and as a developer.  And this is not to say that this only exists in startups or big companies or whatever; some startups will not have that sort of culture, and some big companies will.  I wish I had the magic bullet for figuring those out - if I did, I probably would have had better luck finding places I could thrive in.<p>And now that I&#x27;ve carried on much longer than I thought I would, best of luck in your potential job search and career!",1383591988

But if you think of it in a simple form, you can intuitively see that the ant can reach the end of the rope.",1383591746

Turns out this is actually an astoundingly versatile multifunction hand; the three fingers can each oppose each other and are fast enough to dribble a ping-pong ball 10 times a second, precise enough to use tweezers to pick up a singe grain of rice, and agile enough to throw a cell phone in the air and catch it with fingertips.<p>Rock Paper Scissors is only one trick of many, but of course it&#x27;s the only one the media is interested in.

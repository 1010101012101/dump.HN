272552,comment,272403,272545,0,0,timr,,,"Your whole line of reasoning rests upon the faulty premise that there's a ""free market"" for oil in this country, and that encouraging alternate forms of energy is somehow ""tampering"" with the unfathomably complicated mechanisms behind that market.  All of which is utter nonsense.<p>We subsidize the hell out of oil consumption in this country, and we've done it for as long as we've been consuming.  Once we stop doing things like funding highway construction, suburban infrastructure and corporate oil exploration with our taxes (no, not just gas taxes!), maybe then we can start to talk about the ""free market"" with a straight face.",1218401344

Likewise, Google went from being a stanford research project to the best search engine in less than 3 years.<p>His premise is wrong and the article is an apologia for being slow. Every huge success on the web, and in the computing/internet sector in general has been the result of being better and faster than the competitors.  10 years is way too long.

272545,comment,272403,272539,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I guess I need to be more clear.<p>When we get into ""potential environmental damages"", unless you're prepared to make a risk-reward argument with hard statistics we're treading on personal opinion ground. The Chinese seem to have a fairly high tolerance for air pollution, for instance. Other people don't. The Chinese are going to start drilling off our coast. We are not.<p>I also take issue with your statement we are running out of oil. Not to be pedantic, but it depends on what you mean by ""oil"". There's shale, sweet, sour, crude, light, etc. And that's not even getting into biofuels (which I know you don't imply, but ""oil' could cover those) Look -- I don't know where the market is headed. I guess that makes me unique, because everybody else seems to think they know exactly what's going on. I've heard dozens of experts announce we were at 'peak oil' over the last month, which I personally think is BS. I've read at least one article by an expert that makes the case that oil prices will drop, not rise, over the next 50 years.<p>So I am by no means trying to trivialize your opinions. But I would point out that we certainly have a LOT of opinions about the topic. I've got mine. You've got yours. As a voter, we get to go slug it out at the polls, as it should be.<p>I get the fact that you feel you have a good grip on where the markets are, what the risks are, and what's the best way to manage our transition. To me, that seems presumptuous. No hard feelings. Not trying to label you or somehow put you down or anything. As we both know, you have lots of company. Just doesn't seem right to me.<p>""Ok... so what happens to the poor when we're out of cheap oil?"" -- doesn't the market provide the most goods at the lowest prices, thereby helping the poor much more optimally than a government policy would? When you start fiddling with the markets, you're taking responsibility for the delivery of goods in that market -- like it or not.<p>Guess what? I'm happy being an idiot. I don't presume to know how to deliver the most energy the cheapest way to the world's consumers, and I don't think it's moral for me to hurt or help one group or another based on risks that are not scientifically verified. At least not to this huge degree. If we were talking about something easy like the death penalty, sure, the standard of proof would be much lower. But you're talking about potentially billons of people who will have a harder time reaching their potential for decades while we re-tool.<p>Don't count me in for that.",1218400084

It seems he was more a comic writer than people think, and your reaction might not be so far off.<p>It's fascinating how creations come to be inseparable from the filters (e.g., Kafka as prophet of modernist despair) built up by others after the fact.",1218399620
272542,comment,272403,272483,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"Oil is fungible, but maybe that's missing the point. It's semantic nit-picking that misses the spirit of what the author is trying to convey (perhaps with some exaggeration).<p>I buy ""green"" electricity. That is, all the electricity I pay for is sustainably generated and carbon neutral, from wind, solar, tide or hydro. However, the actually electricity that powers my lights is probably from a coal or nuclear power station. The point is that I pay to put electricity from ""green"" sources into the grid. The fact that the actual electricity that arrives at my house is not the same I paid to generate doesn't matter.<p>If Denmark puts more energy/coal/oil into the market than it uses then it is energy neutral or positive even if people are actually using oil from Saudi or wherever.",1218399524

Having French fighters on a US carrier would be rather interesting from a spare-part/operational point of view, starting with ""do the bloody things fit the catapult?"".<p>To me, the only relevant item is ""where are the landing ships"".

272539,comment,272403,272525,0,0,natrius,,,"""What sacrifices?""<p>The potential environmental damage and future value of that oil that I mentioned. Oil is becoming increasingly scarce. The areas of the planet that currently have a lot of it aren't exactly our friends. Saving that oil for when we actually need it as opposed to dropping the price of a gallon of gas by a couple of cents sounds like a prudent course of action to me.<p>""I don't sit around taking my personal feelings and try to control world markets with them.""<p>The markets for natural resources are heavily influenced by people's personal feelings, so you should probably join the club. More people have a claim of ownership to a barrel of oil than a given widget, so those people will use their position to maximize their self-interest. I think you're trying to trivialize my concerns by referring to them as ""personal feelings"", but I don't think there's anything trivial about wanting to avoid environmental damage and minimize the damage to the American economy that will occur if the transition away from oil is too difficult.<p>""There are all sorts of _possible_ dangers and warnings, but the markets indicate that there is a real, tangible need that's not going away.""<p>I don't see how that has any effect on the situation. Yes, everybody wants cheaper oil, but that doesn't mean more offshore drilling makes us all better off in the end. It will increase our current dependency on oil, making the transition harder when the effects of the new oil wear off. It has the potential to damage the environment. If we need oil for something more important than lowering the price of gas by a few cents in the future, we will have less of it.<p>""The people impacted are third world countries -- mostly the poor. I would think that ""screwing the poor to make the world a more pretty place for me"" wouldn't be much of anything to be proud of.""<p>Ok... so what happens to the poor when we're out of cheap oil? It's incredibly myopic to suggest that we should drill more oil now for the sake of the impoverished.<p>If this were a discussion about Pigovian taxation of oil instead of managing the supply of oil, then yes, we would immediately move into a wealth redistribution discussion. However, this has nothing to do with wealth redistribution. Poor people can afford fewer scarce goods. Oh no.",1218399191
272538,comment,272320,272520,0,0,mdasen,,,"Well, it's an interesting problem.  If the IOC is nice to the ""end user"", they bring in less revenue.  A lot of the revenue that the IOC brings in goes to things like promoting sport.  So, if they bring in less revenue, there is less money for charitable purposes.<p>I tend to agree with your stance and specifically I think all too often non-profits exist more for their own perpetual existence than for a charitable purpose - take 3rd level education in the United States - but one could definitely go the other way.",1218399013
272536,story,,,15,23,ardit33,"What happened to Dropbox, and why some startups are in private beta forever?",,"This is a semi-rant that applies to other startups.  I needed a quick solution for a online backup, and thought dropbox would be perfect for it.  I go to their site, and it seems they are still in private beta?<p>I know they are working on it, and made a huge splash few months ago.  But lots of time has passed, and they haven't released it in the wild.   It seems that once you anounce something, maybe a couple of months of ""private beta"" should be enough, to get something more substantial, then have a more public beta, while you improve it. Why turn customers away?  Early users usually are willing to put up with some functionality missing, as long as they know at some point the features will come.<p>It seems that this trend is among other startups,  anounce something, make a splash,  then nothing.   Guys, don't turn  your customers away.  A two-three months period for a private beta, should be more than enough, then go to a public beta  (gmail was in ""beta"" for years).",1218398740
272535,comment,272403,272529,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"First, I did not dismiss the environmental impact of drilling offshore. We did not discuss it at length. There were some sweeping statements made about my position and I pointed out I do not support those statements. Glad to have that discussion.<p>Second, I made no comment about helping the poor. My comment was about the use of personal opinion to control markets. I used the poor as an example of those who could be impacted by our policies.<p>I made no personal attack and posited no question that was supposed to inflame or outrage. I tried to the best of my ability to ask simple questions and make simple statements that I honestly support. As far as the poor comment, I used the statement as a way of advancing the conversation without it having to take another 50 posts. I obviously do not believe he would support that, and am interested in his reply as to where he thinks the limits of market control should be.<p>You're welcome to join in, by the way.

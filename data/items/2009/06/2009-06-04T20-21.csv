642162,comment,641946,641946,0,0,jcromartie,,,"I've been discouraged from putting code in reusable modules because it would mean one central location for everything to break.  The rationale was that if every routine was copied and pasted where it was needed then introducing an error in one place would not affect other places.<p>I am leaving a company that uses a certain lightweight language to build web apps using CGI.  There is no way to load libraries except by recompiling the runtime, and we do not have the C source code for that runtime in our possession.  This means every library out there (even for the particular language we use, thanks to the fact that we're using a 9-year-old version of the language, and the inability to load binary libraries) is NIH'ed out from the start!  Interfacing with external tools is broken because the function that runs system commands has been changed to be async with no access to the standard streams of the process it creates.<p>The product that is built on top of this is designed to let people build applications using flowcharts with a visual editor... but the ""programming"" that is the result of this system is essentially spaghetti code with GOTO, numbered labels, and a single global scope.  Nodes in these flowcharts are labelled with 100, 110, 200, etc. by default and are laid out automatically, so there's no way to understand a routine at a glance.  Variables in a flowchart get clobbered by other ""subroutines"" when they are called.  Everything is indirections on indirections on indirections.  I could go on... but you can get the idea by looking at this: <a href=""http://imgur.com/ZKCU.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/ZKCU.png</a><p>This is all seen as advanced next-generation modeling that provides massive productivity gains over standard programming practices.<p>At one job I introduced SVN and Tortoise to try to bring version control to the project.  A few weeks later we were using Visual Source Safe because the contractor goons couldn't grasp anything but VSS's Visual Studio integration.  They also moved to doing <i>development</i> on one shared drive so that updating the whole tree could clobber someone's changes that weren't checked in.<p>I was also instructed to not use document.getElementById(), since the IE de-facto ""standard"" was to just refer to the element by its name (or whatever was going on back then).",1244147999

They should only be made in source control check-in comments.<p>The same place felt refactoring was an unproductive activity unless it corrected a specific ""bug"".

Then you would be lambasted for your application not scaling 4 orders of magnitude on the same hardware when that wasn't part of the original requirements.<p>One place I worked for did not allow developers to use the bug-tracking system.  Instead, someone from QA would place printout of open bugs in a bin.

Someone in that department got fed up, so she had me create ETL processes for the four most common competitor products.  Time-to-install went from 4 weeks to 4 days and the error rate dropped 98%.  It won over the COO and some staff, but made me enemies with plenty of others.<p>At the same place a sales manager convinced the COO that RAID1 should be considered a viable backup and disaster recovery solution.  We were tasked with making it so RAID controllers would not back up certain types of files.<p>Another place I worked for as a contractor insisted that their web app was written in ColdFusion.  Despite not having any other contractors past or present, and the market not having any ColdFusion developers.  The reason ended up being is it because it ""sounded cool"".  Needless to say, they have an app still running on ColdFusion 4.<p>I've worked in too many places that are adamant that ""backups"" are all the database version control they need.<p>I've worked at a place that would expect me to develop APIs for certain products and systems we had, yet refused to allow for a requirements gathering phase.  I was actually fired trying to explain that I can't build something when I don't know what I was building.  Reason was so the new CIO could bring on a contracting firm run by a friend of his.  Three other people have since quit in response.",1244146816

Should we expect Google to know where the data was originally published? I do, because it's an important metric in determining PageRank besides the number of inbound links. But that doesn't mean Google shouldn't index it. It might simply be intended as a mirror of the first site.<p>In a recent court case in the Netherlands, some company A filed a complaint against a website because it ran a story about another company B that went bankrupt and mentioned the plaintiff in an unrelated story on the same page. Searching for the plaintiff's company name and ""bankruptcy"", Google would show you a summary that looked like company A had gone under. Does that make the website responsible? Is it Google's fault? The judge decided the website should take responsibility and fix it. I think that you're wasting your time when you're searching Google to find out whether your company has gone bankrupt.<p>In the case of spamxyz.org: report it as spam. In the case of the Dutch court case: use your common sense. In the case of newspapers crying about summaries in the search results: use robots.txt. But people should stop pointing at Google to fix all the problems on the internet. They could do a lot better, but there are plenty of scenarios in which you don't want Google to do decide on their own whether they should show a site in their search results or not.<p>PS: regarding Wikipedia data: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_database</a>",1244145814

I owe my life to child labor and sweatshop labor, allow me to explain.<p>My family is originally from Taiwan, and both of my folks grew up when Taiwan was still an inconsequential tropical island consisted mostly of fishing villages and a hodgepodge government-in-exile. Both of them are beneficiaries of the ""abusive"" practices of foreign businesses. My father worked in a plastics plant, and once had to outrace a cloud of deadly chlorine gas, and survived by the grace of a low wall surrounding the factory (chlorine crawls along the ground). Safety practices were almost non-existent - my mother is still missing a small chunk of her right index finger (and she was lucky). My mother's family was desperately poor - my grandfather eventually succumbed to years of breathing in coal dust with no protective equipment, and all of his children worked from as young as 10 years-old to put themselves through school.<p>But here's the thing: people in that country could not afford to educate themselves, and if it were not for the willingness of employers to hire child labor and form sweatshops, they would never have had the opportunity to climb out of that hole.<p>If you had insisted on no child labor, minimum pay standards, and rigorous safety adherence, there would have been <i>no</i> reason to set up shop in a backwater island like Taiwan, and then where would we be? My family would likely still be living in the jungles up on some mountain somewhere, starving.",1248303548

718733,comment,718279,718279,0,0,rabidgnat,,,"I've found a way to partially counteract a manager's meeting schedule: splinter my work into extremely small pieces, and write them down in a TODO list. These tasks must have a clear DONE/NOT DONE boundary, and shouldn't need to be revisited. You should also break it up so that every time you finish something, you should be able to check something off of your TODO list. If it's not already there, add it, and then check it off.<p>For instance, if I had to write code to read data from a GPS unit, I might break it up like this:<p>* Find data spec on new GPS unit.
* Look up current GPS interface.. if none, write an example and design an API around the example.
* Write out header file (We use C++... that's another story :D)
* Write function 1.
...
* Write function n.
* Procure GPS unit.
* Debug.<p>I always feel some personal inertia against doing a task like ""Write class to load data from the new GPS unit"", but it's pretty hard to look at each subtask and say ""err, I guess I should organize my inbox."" Which I would probably do otherwise.<p>I have trouble finding tasks that are indivisible, but they exist! Designing and implementing custom data structures is one that I've run into recently... it has an ambiguous up-front design cost that makes it hard to divvy-up work.",1248303526

718723,comment,718132,718694,0,0,mrshoe,,,"Just look at the stock market as an example. Many people speak of the stock market in terms of a zero-sum game, because on any given transaction if one person makes money the other loses money. However, every day more and more money gets pumped into the stock market, so that, on aggregate, everyone makes positive interest.<p>The same is true of our standard of living. The standard of living index, so to speak, has been increasing for a long time (forever, maybe?), and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Everyone's standard of living will increase, in aggregate.<p>However, if people in poorer parts of the world start commanding higher salaries, people in more affluent areas won't be able to buy things as inexpensively as they do now. That's exactly what FSJ is pointing out here. I don't understand why I'm being down-modded for echoing it.<p>There was a time when Kings built huge castles and palaces.

Ditto (but to an even greater extent) for land prices. Doubling/tripling the price of gas still wouldn't make it advantageous cost-wise to move from a 3000 sq ft/280 sq meters residence in the countryside to that same square footage in the city, at least not in Cambridge/Boston from say a rural or suburban area on 128 (the ring road). (And this would be even more pronounced once energy tax policy made city property more valuable than rural property.)<p>To whatever extent that I am after change, I'm after change that taxes energy consumption with the aim to discourage wasteful or ""frivolous"" use of energy. One or two people living in a 5000 sq ft McMansion? Wasteful, IMO. They shouldn't be barred from doing it, but I don't mind if their energy is taxed to discourage it. Same with my cars, airplane, or 2400 sq ft house for the 3 of us. I think that economic [dis]incentive and personal choices given that landscape is the most fair means to allow people to decide what's important to them and act accordingly.<p>Should we ban cars older than 5 years, or 10 years from now ban non-electrics, or mandate that you can only have 600 sq ft + 400 sq ft/person, mandate thermostat settings, insulation retrofits to existing buildings, etc? Absolutely not; just adjust the energy rates until you get approximately the macro effect you want, and people will make choices within that framework.<p>For the record, I'm not strongly advocating that we should triple energy cost via taxation, merely observing that small behavior changes came about from $4 a gallon gas, and that larger changes would come from $10/gal pricing.

In his fantastic book ""Mathematics: A History"" he makes the point that calculus is taught entirely backwards from its historical development, and he says that approach ruins most undergrads in truly learning calculus. In line with Abel's dictum to ""Study the masters, and not the pupils"", it's obvious that sweeping the why and how of calcuclus under the rug, and instead presenting a polished and abstract end-product is a disaster as far as learning goes. As natural tinkerers and hackers, surely we can appreciate how much more you can learn by peaking behind the curtain, taking apart the machine and trying to put it back together again.<p>Sure we can thank Cauchy and Weierstrauss for working out the logical kinks and putting centuries of ungrounded assumptions on a proof-based foundation, but the FTC is a hell of a lot easier to understand on an intuitive level if you started with series, derived integrals and then saw how derivatives came out of that, rather than the other way around.<p>The real problem with mathematics education is that they are teaching to the least-common denominator on a mass-scale, adopting the attitude that 99% of students won't need to really know how it works under the hood. If students can just grind through the problem sets, it's good enough, so the entire curriculum, text books, and TA lectures are tailored to that.

The Internet gives you the ability to publish as much data and detail as you choose.  It allows you to target a selected audience and provide information and discussion topics that relate to a specific audience that would not have been cost effective to reach in the past.<p>However, if you're more trying to promote yourself or your own ""brand"" vs. trying to provide actionable valuable data, then yes, you must generalize heavily.",1248300416

Asimov's laws address ""three fundamental Rules of Robotics, the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot's positronic brain"", i.e., an engineering construct. The article mostly addresses a legal issue: ""Accordingly, robo-ethicists want to develop a set of guidelines that could outline how to punish a robot, decide who regulates them and even create a 'legal machine language' that could help police the next generation of intelligent automated devices.""<p>I also love how the article ends with ""Morality is impossible to write in formal terms"", and yet, it expects to see complex enough robots to warrant the article in the first place.",1248300261

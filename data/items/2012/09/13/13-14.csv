4516137,comment,4515434,4515557,9,0,JackC,,,"FWIW, I agree with masklinn that it's a little weird not to mention WebOS in the article. In particular when you wrote ""In short, Firefox OS is about taking the technologies behind the Web, like JavaScript, and using them to produce an entire mobile operating system. Just let that sink in for a moment  it's a mobile OS powered by JavaScript!"" I let that sink in back in 2009 when they announced WebOS. I was pretty excited about it. The way it crashed and burned from internal wrangling, delays, buggy releases and odd marketing was really sad. This is like you're showing up a year after the Hindenburg crashed and saying ""Just let this sink in -- we've invented a rigid lighter-than-air flying machine!"" That's not where we are in the conversation.<p>The rest of the article is really exciting, and I really hope you can launch and get some traction. I agree that Mozilla is important in this space for exactly the same reasons Firefox was important when it launched. I just think it would be kind to tip your hat to WebOS along the way.",1347544756

4516130,comment,4514955,4515830,5,0,cabacon,,,"That will be nice, but it's still not a sufficient trade-off for duration in your day, unless your time spent in the autonomous car counts as part of your work day.  I liked the idea of taking the train into the city instead of driving to my current job, partially because I had this fantasy about how I would be able to use my time on the train productively, as opposed to just driving.<p>But, the thing is, the train trip into the city is 1 hour, and the drive is 30 minutes.  And the train schedule is dictated by people who work 8 hours in the office; taking an off-schedule train is a much worse proposition.  So even though I gain the time on the train (which is probably not as valuable as I think it is) I still lose out on the rest of my life for having 1 hour less per day to spend completely electively.<p>So, yeah, I'd like it if my car drove me into work so I was free to do other things.  But I would still value a 30 minute autonomous drive much more highly than a 1 hour autonomous drive.",1347544657

It's entirely possible, if uncommon, to overdose when self-administering vasodilating drugs. A lot of vasodilators work by ionically tweaking the fluid retention of the kidneys, which, if thrown out of whack, can lead to all sorts of not-so-fun problems.<p>In general, be careful when messing with your blood vessels, or with any drugs that change the ionic balance of your bloodstream.<p>The other thing I'd say is TANSTAAFL.

On the other hand, lots of artists create amazing work that's so will make you think you're going to have a heart attack just looking at the rats nest. But hey--these are programming amateurs and they're doing amazing things, really fast! I know some musicians who could cook up amazing stuff in Max so fast I would still be thinking about how I would structure the code and they'd be demoing it. It's also important to remember that much of what we focus on as professional programmers is less important to artists for whom cost of implementation is far more important than reuse.<p>Regarding version control, yes, modern max patches are in fact serialized to disk as JSON. There's an option you can set that causes the program to perform a sort on the structure on save, hopefully minimizing the diff. I worked w/ max patches in git for years, and it was fine though I never really tried to do anything even remotely interesting like merge from another branch; I treated my max patches more like binaries in version control that happened to be stored really efficiently.<p>In the end, much of the work I would do in Max involved writing a lot of things in C/Java/Javascript and wiring it up, and the reason is, as you alluded to, the mouse. It's just not as productive to move boxes around for me as it is to write text, but boxes and lines make really great glue code for putting together inputs, outputs, and a set of algorithms into a single work, especially if that work is time-related in some way.",1347542624

What you're trying to push aside as a technicality has been a recurring sore point between Apple's App Store and the FOSS community, and Denis-Courmont is <i>far</i> from the only person who has been upset by attempts to distribute GPL'd software via the App Store under terms are incompatible with both the letter and the spirit of the GPL.

They could release the code under a licence that doesn't even require the credit/copyright/disclaimer, I suppose, but those aren't exactly a heavy burden. Other that that, the whole point of licences like the MIT ones is basically to avoid having the kinds of restrictions that would ever result in copyright enforcement action, so it's not like you need a single party with standing to sue or issue takedown notices, for example. I don't see what anyone gains by having this extra hoop for contributors to jump though.<p>[Edit: Someone posted the actual text of the CLA.

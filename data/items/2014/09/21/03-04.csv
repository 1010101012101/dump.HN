Looks like there are lot of entrepreneurs in this thread, so some advice maybe good for me. I have identified a pain point in a present system at my company, and since then got to know that this is a industry wide problem. My employer would not solve this issue, and would not give me permission to build it on my own time, as one of my colleague suggested the same six months back and they were not enthusiastic and would not release him from the specific clause in the job&#x27;s terms and conditions. One of my Managers, who left the company, and is still on good terms with me proposed the idea to his company and the company wants to see the initial prototype. I have none at this point, so will need to develop it.<p>The problem is, I cannot forego my job income because of upcoming personal situation. Potential customer will not give me lump sum money, and wants to hire me as a consultant, but then I would not be able to sell it to other customers. If I build the product in my spare time, my employer owns it as it is directly in company&#x27;s field of operation. Angel networking people I have talked to have also asked for a working prototype, but I have none and for building one a good developer will be needed.<p>So can somebody please give some suggestions on this? Or if someone from Edmonton or Alberta is reading this please get in touch with me @ msedm@outlook.com .",1411271475

You mean like a FP ML then ala OCaml / F#.<p>I said I like hybrid OO-FP languages for business productivity, rather than concentrating on meaningless software architecture astronautics like that &quot;Blue Book&quot; you linked. I&#x27;ve read it, yes starting from chapter 11, and while I took it on board I find many of its ideas and practices completely toxic now. Just like Gang of Four patterns and the inane amount that OOP inherently relies upon them.<p>Then you go off on some academic rant about &quot;well in 1989&quot; (no one cares) and HPC computing (no one cares, it&#x27;s hardly relevant either). FP has progressed a lot since 89 but you&#x27;re seemingly too old and set in your purely OOP ways to realise it. Carry on. But take a look at a modern OO-FP multi paradigm language and feel enlightened.<p>If you carry on down the path of ranting about FP because, shock horror, yes it is slower than imperative code then you&#x27;ll look even sillier.

I was very angry that he stopped talking to me, and he gave me all sorts of excuses as to why, but his criticisms told the truth of what was really bothering him.<p>Over time, what I&#x27;ve had to accept is that he has limitations, and he&#x27;s not the hero I had made him out to be. It&#x27;s takes time coming to terms with reality that way, especially when you thought so highly of the person to begin with.",1411268821

Yes, a protocol and a data format can be convenient when applied to a specific problem, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>everything</i> should use them.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people refuse to use LDAP, and request a JSON (not rest) API instead, thus disregarding the security benefits of using a protocol that has 20 years of experience for dealing with access control and authentication.<p>Postgres has a tremendously powerful and efficient network protocol. There is great value in using and understanding it, because not every problem is a nail that can be hammered with a few GET requests.",1411268679

The extent to which it has carried through to more modern code, varies, though. I suspect systems programming has an overall higher ratio of &quot;old school&quot; C developers than application code does.",1411268636

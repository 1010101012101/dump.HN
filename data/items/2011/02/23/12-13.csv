When hiring we were specifically advised by our legal team <i>not</i> to tell people why they were unsuccessful.  It doesn't matter how careful you are, anything you say can be leapt upon by an unsuccessful candidate and used as an excuse to drag you to court claiming that they were discriminated against.  This is especially true in these days of ""No Win, No Fee"" lawyers.<p>Sometimes, of course, the prospective candidate really has no skills at all in the required areas.  I'm reminded of the Tom Lehrer quotation:<p><pre><code>  "" ... one of the many fine things one has to admit\n    is the way that the army has carried the American\n    democratic ideal to its logical conclusion in the\n    sense that not only do they prohibit discrimination\n    on the grounds of race, creed, and color, but also\n    on the grounds of ability. ""\n</code></pre>\nBut I'd love to tell people why they were unsuccessful.  I'd love to give them the opportunity to learn, to grow, to improve, or in some cases simply to say ""Well, I guess we weren't a good fit.""<p>However, the age of litigation prevents me from doing that.  And I'm not allowed to say ""Sorry"" either, because that could be taken as an admission of culpability.<p>(edited to add the Lehrer quotation)",1298465978

2253898,comment,2253497,2253736,0,0,EnderMB,,,"> A Mechanic does not fix you car based on a total cost, they charge a hourly labor rate + parts. A lawyer bills for his services by the hour. Both will provide a best guess at what they think it will take, but if you add some work or they find some problems you eat that cost not them.<p>You're not a Lawyer or a Mechanic, you're (possibly) a Web Developer and it's fairly standard to charge based on project, as referenced by countless guides, online resources and notably within SitePoint's Web Design Business Kit. I've already stated the reasons why you do this, because it confirms the overall cost with the client, it ensures the project will not overrun at the clients expense, and in the end the client has an overall budget for this work, not a certain amount to spend per hour.<p>As time has shown, paying by the hour is a poor and dated way to do business on the web because building software isn't an exact science and many projects overrun. In the same vein I cannot understand why people have to treat software development as a ""profession"" like Lawyers or Doctors. You're selling a software solution to a client, so you should charge for that solution, in the same way that people who offer products or solutions charge.<p>> Ignorance of the discipline of software development is the employer problem, a good software developer can show them how scope creep, change in priorities and adjustments to specification has a negative impact on their expectations. If they feel cheated that is their problem to deal with, software development is not charity and if it takes twice as long to build and a developer puts in twice as many hours then they should be paid twice the hours just as any other service professional is.<p>That's a fantastic way not to get hired for a project.<p>It cannot be more simple than setting a price on your time per hour, estimating how long a project will take and charging what you feel your time is worth as a lump sum. The client should not get to dictate that, because you're the expert and you'll have the better idea of how long it should take.",1298465715

2253872,comment,2253195,2253629,0,0,dualogy,,,"Oh man <i>some</i> consumers behave like spoiled brats... the word ""bastards"" is extremely unwarranted. These airbnb folks are putting a massively useful service up and airlines put some serious heavyweights up in the air 1000s of times per day. These facilitators' rewards are miniscule compared to the benefit and achievement their customers enjoy. It should be 100% up to them and only them how they present fees and pricings for their business offering which they created painstakingly in <i>any</i> event. Even before some EU bureaucrats ""intervened and forced these bastards"" there was good competition among european no-frills airlines that also resulted in some (airberlin I'm sure, easyjet at some point tooI think) proudly proclaiming how they do show the <i>full</i> price, including all fees charges taxes. This simply has to be good enough for customers and they better know their place. If you think airbnb is doing it wrong, you have a massive opportunity at hand. If you think this is not enough differentiation to win big against airbnb, that just proves customers do not <i>really</i> care about that particular aspect. They just like to complain sometimes about minor annoyances equivalent to a mosquito sting, and unfortunately some as you think an initial, quite possibly unfounded expectation was not fulfilled is a reason to keep an ever-growing cancer such as an EU alive. You lose more in ever-growing tax payments overall and in the long run than through (some) web site's or airlines' ""shady"" practices.<p>This is such a non-issue. You ALWAYS, everywhere see a TOTAL price before check-out and can still fully cancel by simply doing nothing (ie. not clicking check-out).

2253842,comment,2252152,2252686,0,0,eftpotrm,,,"The core issue here (IMHO) can be summed up as:<p>* We all (and I'm aware I'm a pretty young account myself) vote on stories and comments to rank their quality<p>* Newer users vote less in line with the historic ethos because they're less aware of it<p>* All our votes have equal power (the downvote filter here is a crude effort to suppress that but isn't powerful enough to be fully effective)<p>* Network effect means a successful site's growth will be closer to exponential than linear<p>* With exponential growth the new who are unaware of the community standards are quickly able to overpower the existing who are aware<p>Hence almost inevitable degradation in quality which people here are complaining about and which I can partially see myself.<p>Two ways to partially address this spring to mind:<p>* Express vote power as a function of reputation - an upgrade to the downvote system. This has the problem that it provides a direct incentive to align with groupthink and post the easy but commonly held stories and threads so as to attract repuation and so increase one's voting power and.... It also, I think, requires floating point reputation and scoring, and so increases computational load.<p>* Display voting based on a similarity function - 'users who liked this also liked....'. This permits cohorts of users to work en masse without prior coordination to lower the ranking of content they find less interesting / valuable and so get what they want more easily. This means though that it increases fragmentation and reinforces groupthink again <i>by design</i>, which is clearly not ideal. It's also again significantly more computationally expensive.<p>TL;DR: Computation can be thrown at partial improvements but they're expensive to operate, open to gaming and likely to reinforce groupthink. I'm not sure it's socially or technically possible to keep the noisy brats out without severely damaging what attracted the Grand Old Users in the first place. Welcome to social groups...",1298463897

I'm almost annoyed by them because I don't see HN as getting worse.</i><p>Yes, it's almost an inside joke. One of the ""classic"" HN stories is the meta story where we all lament the decaying state of HN. The ""naval gazing"" stories. You learn either to ignore them or vent (politely) After watching them for a while, I think they serve to help release a lot of frustration people have.<p>I would note that many of the folks early on who said HN was fine are now also saying there are problems.<p>To me, HN's core problem was the problem you always have when speaking to more than five people: trying to anticipate reactions. You end up trying to cover every possible response, and it kills the tone. One of the reasons my comments run on so long is that I have to cover every obvious way they could be misunderstood. You're stuck either not replying to anybody, writing long comments, or getting in endless debates. All of that is distasteful to me.<p>One of the hard lessons I had to learn blogging was not to tease people. I used to put pictures of girls in bikinis up or joke around about making money tricking people online -- to me I was just playing. I live by my reputation: being an internet porn mogul is not on my list of future plans. But there were a heckuva lot of folks who didn't understand my posts, who thought that made me some kind of evil person. It was really sad to have to give up the playful part of my personality simply to get along with people because of the many ways things can be misunderstood. I hate that.<p>But the real problem is that everybody's personality will piss somebody off somewhere. I know I probably rub thousands of people the wrong way just because I'm the way I am. Others do the same. So then I end up commenting something like ""Looks like it is raining outside"" and I get 3 or 4 downvotes. Sure, the upvotes outweigh them, but it's just silly nonsense.

It really depends on what you're developing for, of course.<p>> - It already ships with a decent web browser. No need to download and install one.<p>IE8 is more than decent - it is by far the most popular and reliable method for downloading Firefox. Also, do any OSX power users even use Safari? All the OSX people I know use either Chrome or Firefox.<p>> - The App Store promises near-Linux ease for finding, selecting, downloading and keeping software up-to-date. It certainly beats the Windows way of googling for the software, hitting a malware site, going back, searching more, finding the correct site, downloading an executable and giving it the keys to the kingdom so it can do whatever it wants with your computer, something it may never recover from.<p>My first experience with the App Store was being asked for credit card information when I tried to download the free Twitter app. Ninite is a Windows app that comes close to doing what the App Store does.",1298463818

The Premier League is different in that it has a large number of strong teams who can fight for Europa League places. If anything, being compared to the Championship is a huge compliment, as the Championship is a fiercely competitive league that produces teams that have done extremely well in the past few years (Blackpool being the latest example).<p>MLS will never be rated as good as European leagues because they're never in direct competition with European teams.

That kind of index(an inverted word index) could be generated from the ideal data format, but it would be stupid store such a rich data set in such a dumb, information-losing format.<p>""The index"" would just be a list of key/values.  The key would be a URL, and the value would be the content located at that URL.  There would also be some kind of metadata attached to the keys to indicate HTTP status code, HTTP header information, last-crawled date, and any other interesting data.  From this data set, other, more appropriate indexes could be generated(for example via hadoop)<p>> In the end, what the author really wants is for someone to maintain a separate copy of the internet for bots.<p>Yes, but not for bots.  It would be for algorithms.<p>> In order for someone to do that, they'd need to charge the bot owners<p>Probably..  The funding could be like ICANN, whose long-term funding comes from groups that benefit from its services.<p>> but the bot owners could just index your content for free, so why would they pay?<p>How would you create a copy of the internet for free?  Are you just going to run your crawler on your home modem while you're at work?  Where are you going to store all that data?  How are you going to process it?  How long is that going to take?

2586019,comment,2584436,2584436,12,0,leot,,,"Methods section of their whitepaper:<p>In our Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) system, we achieve a good balance of precision and speed by using a two-pass hash-based system. In the first pass, we compute an approximate distance from the target series to a hash of each series in our database. In the second pass, we compute the exact distance function on the top results returned from the first pass.<p>Each query is described as a series in a high-dimensional space. For instance, for us-weekly, we use normalized weekly counts from January 2003 to present to represent each query in a 400+ dimensional space. For us-states, each query is represented as a 51-dimensional vector (50 states and the District of Columbia). Since the number of queries in the database is in the tens of millions, computing the exact correlation between the target series and each database series is costly. To make search feasible at a large scale, we employ an ANN system that allows fast and efficient search in high-dimensional spaces.<p>Traditional tree-based nearest neighbors search methods are not appropriate for Google Correlate due to the high dimensionality of the data resulting in sparseness of the data. Most of these methods reduce to brute force linear search with such data. For Google Correlate, we used a novel asymmetric hashing technique which uses the concept of projected quantization [16] to reduce the search complexity. The core idea behind projected quantization is to exploit the clustered nature of the data, typically observed with various real-world applications. At the training time, the database query series are projected in to a set of lower dimensional spaces.<p>Each set of projections is further quantized using a clustering method such as K-means. K-means is appropriate when the distance between two series is given by Euclidean distance. Since Pearson correlation can be easily converted into Euclidean distance by normalizing each series to be a standard Gaussian (mean of zero, variance of one) followed by a simple scaling (for details, see appendix), K-means clustering gives good quantization performance with the Google Correlate data. Next, each series in the database is represented by the center of the corresponding cluster.<p>This gives a very compact representation of the query series. For instance, if 256 clusters are generated, each query series can be represented via a unique ID from 0 to 255. This requires only 8 bits to represent a vector. This process is repeated for each set of projections. In the above example, if there are m sets of projections, it yield an 8m bit representation for each vector.<p>During the online search, given the target series, the most correlated database series are retrieved by asymmetric matching. The key concept in asymmetric matching is that the target query is not quantized but kept as the original series. It is compared against the quantized version of each database series. For instance, in our example, each database series is represented as an 8m bit code. While matching,\nthis code is expanded by replacing each of the 8 bits by the corresponding K-means center obtained at training time, and Euclidean distance is computed between the target series and the expanded database series. The sum of the Euclidean distances between the target series and the database series in m subspaces represents the approximate distance between the two. Approximate distance between target series and the database series is used to rank all the database series. Since the number of centers is usually small, matching of the target series against all the database series can be done very quickly.<p>To further improve the precision, we take the top one thousand series from the database returned by our approximate search system (the first pass) and reorder those by doing exact correlation computation (the second pass). By combining asymmetric hashes and reordering, the system is able to achieve more than 99% precision for the top result at about 100 requests per second on O(100) machines, which is orders of magnitude faster than exact search.",1306366872

Patients do care about such things.<p>There has been a great deal of focus on the delivery of procedures in health care and not so much on actual cures.  Compensation is entirely based on procedures.  A doctor may be rated on how a procedure was performed, but only a patient can decide if the result was good.<p>Perhaps a system that quantified a patient's health before and after an experience is a good way to go or over time is the way to go.  If a doctor is able to keep his patients healthier, he's a good doctor.  But that's pretty difficult to do  with ""random"" ratings.  Which is probably why word of mouth is probably more trusted.

2585921,comment,2582913,2585692,2,0,rkalla,,,"Perfect distinction between ""satisfaction"" and ""happiness"".<p>I think both are important. Satisfaction is typically the result of accomplishment. Accomplishments give us confidence. Confidence (an amazing subject) gives us the strength to mold and shape our lives into things we want.<p>As an MMA'ist, you know better than probably anyone here the role that confidence has in a fight. If you are fighting someone new to the ring, you've probably had that sense where you can feel yourself dominating him before that first bell ever rings... and he probably feels it too.<p>I think Happiness plays an important role in exciting us out of bed in the morning; giving us a spring in our step and helping us chase things that eventually bring us satisfaction.<p>Happiness recharges our willpower (re: this article) and that helps us move forward towards things that bring us satisfaction and the circle feeds on itself.<p>My limited understanding of this, right now, is something like:<p>Happiness > Accomplishment > Satisfaction > Confidence (loop)<p>Without the little things in life that make you happy, you can still accomplish things, but you will eventually run out of gas or do it begrudgingly and the satisfaction won't come.<p>From what you describe, I wonder if that was what was going on. You continued to do things that you felt brought you satisfaction  (fighting) and would time again get to the precipice of ""Accomplishment"" and stop, so the opponent would take the win and you would fall back a rung in the ladder and feel crappy and feed this cycle of self doubt.<p>Was the fighting making you <i>happy</i> or was that missing from the equation and you liked it for other reasons? (stress relief, toughness, etc)<p>This isn't at all as hard as MMA, but I do something identical to this with tennis. When I play regularly I'm pretty good; strong serve, good returns, fast balls, big topspin, etc.<p>The thing that frustrated me to the point of <i>stopping</i> playing tennis was that no matter HOW GOOD OR BAD the opponent I played was, I would always lose to them.<p>It was so obviously a mental handicap that it stunned me into a silent rage when I played.<p>I could play a 4.5 and hang in with them one day, getting to 3 sets and eventually losing. Then play a 3.0 the next day, go to 3 sets and lose to them.<p>I don't know if it was a lack of accomplishment on the court such that I could never push forward in the circle of confidence, but I realized it wasn't making me happy. So I stopped.<p>Much like you said, I always wonder if I just ""gave up"" -- but I really do subscribe to the ""Guilt is bullshit"" thought process, so I don't dwell on it. I just figure ""Hey, if some day I decide to get back on the court, I'll do it. End of story.""<p>If some day you decide Featherweight is all you want, you'll get back in that ring and do it and the whole will-he/won't-he back and forth in your head will be irrelevant because you will have made up your mind THIS is what you are doing and THIS is what is going to happen.<p>Sorry if that was preachy... the similarity between what you said an my own fumblings with sports was uncanny so I had a lot to say on the subject ;)",1306364912

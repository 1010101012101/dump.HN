When I snapped out of my dogmatic slumber as an MS dev I was shocked at how much I had been missing and how much better my work got when informed by the computing world as a whole. Although my knowledge, like most people's, is still partial and fragmented, nevertheless this was a real and very valuable state change. So I can't help but respectfully suggest that if you want to grow as a software person, you should probably seek something equivalent in your own path. It's not a question of breadth vs. depth.

Nevertheless, both smoking and drinking are regulated and for good measure. Who can disagree with that?<p>Well, me, for starters. Should you be able to smoke marijuana in your home? Choose your own medical treatments and practioners? How about not letting a English doctor practice in the States for... no good reason? Does that bother you? Should you be able to eat fatty food? It's your life, I have no right to vote to place controls on it. And you have no right to vote to place controls on me. It might happen, but if it does, it's wrong.<p>> At some point in the not to distant future everyone will have a smart phone.<p>If it matters to you, choose the most open options and protect what you share. Be intelligent and use your own discretion. I believe in your capacity to make good decisions for yourself, I believe you're smarter and more well-equipped to make the right choices for you than politicians, lobbyists, and bureaucrats. Likewise, I want to be able to make my own choices about my own life, and the idea of well-meaning politicians, lobbyists, and bureaucrats affecting my options is a very unpleasant idea.<p>> There is no feasible way that this will not be regulated. We can only hope that when it is regulated it is done as a shield and not a sword.<p>See, I'm not going to hope - I'm going to look at track records.

Isn't there usually a reason that people are working where they are?  Things such as chosen field and salary?  We're not talking about teenagers working fungible minimum wage jobs here...<p>Everyone tries to minimize their commute times and where they end up living is a reflection of the compromise between different values.  I think this article points out that people don't prioritize commute time enough because its only taken in small daily doses and that's a valid point, but that time is also not completely wasted if you can find something productive to do (e.g. listening to audiobooks, language lessions or relevant news).",1318269535

3094967,comment,3093323,3094791,2,0,gilgad13,,,"In C, at least, it helps to think of regions of memory independently of any meaning overlaid on top.  For instance, there is plenty of code that depends on behavior like this:<p><pre><code>    struct list_node {
        struct list_node * next;
        struct list_node * prev;
    }
    
    struct useful {
        /* This struct should be part of a list, so include the list header first */
        struct list_node;
    
        /* That data that this struct is storing follows */
        in_addr_t sip;
        in_port_t sport;
        in_addr_t dip;
        in_addr_t dport;
    
    }
</code></pre>
Then, you can write a generic list walker by casting the a ""struct useful * "" to a ""struct list_node * "" since the first fields will match up.<p>This is just one example, another would be parsing and unwrapping ip headers and data sections.  As I'm sure you've noticed, C prefers explicit to implicit, and this applies to the layout of memory as well.<p><i>edit:</i> example: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3766229/casting-one-struct-pointer-to-other-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3766229/casting-one-struc...</a>",1318269519

3094948,comment,3094360,3094360,27,0,naner,,,"The thing I use lsof for most often these days is watching Flash videos with mplayer (or VLC if you prefer). This allows me to pause/rewind/fullscreen easier. Or sometimes I save the file to watch later. You still have to start the video from within Flash and then pause it so it downloads the video file. Then you can do this:<p><pre><code>    $ lsof | grep Flash
    plugin-co 1038   naner   16w   REG   254,2  4442164 7602188 /tmp/FlashXXfHeQqB (deleted)
    $ mplayer /proc/1038/fd/16
</code></pre>
Oftentimes the output will give you duplicates for the same temporary flash file (FlashXXfHeQqB in this case) with an extra number after the process id, you can ignore all of that. I'm assuming those are child processes. All you need is the process id (1038) and the file descriptor (16). You can safely ingore the character (w) after the file descriptor.<p>Back in the day (Flash 9 or so?) the flash player used to just dump temporary flash video files in /tmp and delete them after you close the browser tab. I guess they figured it was too easy to copy the files out of /tmp so the newer flash player deletes the /tmp file immediately after it creates them. This is why we have to go and grab the open file descriptor.<p>This will work with most but not <i>all</i> websites. Some websites (Hulu) will use a streaming protocol (rtsp) among other things to make the content harder to get at outside of flash.<p>This works on Linux, I'm not sure about OSX or BSD.",1318269348

Apple has a powerful self-interest in making sure the Web remains a second-best app platform behind iOS and desktop OS X. Mozilla wants the Web to be the premier app platform - but it's no bloody good to Mozilla if the web is the world's #1 web platform but Mozilla has no control over it anymore. The <i>last</i> thing Mozilla wants to see is the Web browser become some fairly-easily-implemented, highly-interchangeable runtime platform adhering to a stable, open spec somewhere. This would, I think, be very good for the world at large, but it would undoubtedly be very bad for Mozilla - it's what is known as the <i>commoditization of the platform</i>. Mozilla's self-interest is served by keeping as much of the Web as possible controlled, in the minutest detail possible, by the hard-to-join club of major browser vendors. Right down to things like the lexical syntax of JavaScript. So in reality, as soon as Google proposed such an IL, Mozilla's advocates would start blowing smoke about ""oh no, another Java"".",1318268601

Hastings knows that streaming is the future, and he went into startup mode to try to turn his ship in that direction.  The two problems are customer expectations and movies studios demands.<p>Customer expectations are a bitch because people believe $10 is the right price for Netflix and $16 is outrageous, even though this is a fraction of the cost of all traditional options.  Now that expectations are set, price hikes just enrage people.  But for a good selection of streaming content, people are going to have to be enraged for a while.  We already saw what happened to Hulu.  The reality is that studios are not going to let their revenues be decimated just so that we can live in our utopian future of streaming anything we want for $10/month.  That is such a kick in their gut that they will be willing to spend the money to all build their own shitty services that fail over the next 4-5 years, put up with rampant piracy, and take any number of viewer-hostile actions all to avoid accepting Netflix's vision.  Eventually I believe the market will cut them down to size, but getting everything you want is going to cost more than $10/month.<p>I give Reed Hastings a lot of credit for trying to bring the future faster by focusing on streaming, but he overplayed his hand.  Netflix's clout comes from its user base size and the fact that it's DVD business is unassailable by big media.  They're not going to be able to throw their weight around on streaming deals, and studios will be dragging their feet anyway.  The smart thing to do is to focus on streaming and always be aware that it's the future, but keep DVDs as a value anchor so customers can justify the mediocre streaming selection.",1318267070

3094752,comment,3092558,3094072,1,0,cromwellian,,,"What do you mean Dart-to-JS can't be faster than hand-code JS? That's like saying C can't be faster than hand-coded assembly.  Unless you write unmaintainable code or spend efforts counting cycles and scheduling and pipeline harzards, this usually isn't the case, and is not the way most people write large application (all in asm). If you take your average hand-written Javascript and run it through closure compiler, in many cases, it ends up executing faster (at least in V8). If you haven't already, I would recommend investigating the behavior of JS VMs with and without Closure Compiler, you might be surprised.<p>We're talking averages here, not pathological edge cases. Java has a 64-bit long type which JS doesn't support. GWT supports longs. In theory, GWT code should run slower, in practice, because GWT contains an optimizer, it runs as well, or faster, than hand written JS, simply because very few code bases have hot paths dependent on long arithmetic. For example, I've actually ported popular JS benchmarks to Java, ran them through GWT, and the result was faster.<p>Sure, would you be able to concoct applications for which Dart and Dart-to-JS have a large divergence? Yes. Will they be the common case? Probably not. I can concoct normal JS applications today which show high divergence between Chrome, Firefox, and IE, because of all of the JS VMs have different weaknesses, different optimizers, different garbage collectors. If you're writing applications that are so CPU bound and performance critical (e.g. games), chances are you're going to run into other portability problems too.<p>Most of this worry over runtime performance I think is a red herring. The real difference will probably be in startup time.",1318267005

Personal reasons at that and boy I hope I don't regret this choice.<p>1. I've got an investor on board not with many connections but whom can provide all the capital I need, frankly we have more than enough. Connections I thought YC will provide, then it became clear to one that I can reach out to anyone I want using the internet. If my product is worthy of their time or response I will achieve it, YC can help I thought and boy PG is influential but I'm going to take my chances.<p>2. I'm from the UK and the whole process of relocating even for three months would be so much of a distraction. The culture change, the knowing that I will have some major VISA issues once the program has ended.<p>3. I'm at alpha. I love my business model, I believe in it. I've had some epic pivots already and frankly I'm at the stage where in alpha testing I truly do think I could be on to something. I feel one year or 6months down the line I will be at the public stage, maybe it would be better to use the YC card when I'm having issues managing growth or sourcing that $500k investment.<p>Above all I have the feeling I won't regret not applying. That's why I know I'm doing the right thing; oh boy I left it late and that's a statement of how powerful YC truly is. A statement of how it can turn a exceptional individual and a poor idea into a great business (pivots included).<p>I wish the applicants all the best and maybe one day you will be the alumni I reach out too.",1318266895

What we want to build is a way for people (especially developers and wannabe entrepreneurs) to immediately take advantage of the ecosystem in which they are operating even if they are located in a place where the startup community is not present in the territory, getting initial exposure for their early stage products so that they can get validated learning and customer insight.
I like to think of it as a way of ""automating partnerships"", partnership meaning that i promote you since i know you' ll promote me and we will both benefit from this. 
Its especially geared towards mvps and beta pages, since it s not always easy for them to reach decent ( or even minimum ) traffic and this leads to a lack of information, which is the worst thing that could happen to a freshly started company. Our mantra is alone we fall, united we stand.<p>Following the Lean Startup methodology ( awesome book, by the way ) I decided to release a MVP early, without it being perfect or anything near perfection.<p>What is important for us at this stage of development is learning and getting constructive feedback.

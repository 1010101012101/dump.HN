He's a smart guy, but he grew up in some podunk town in Virginia, his family was decidedly middle class, and he went to a public high school. But he worked hard, got accepted to the Air Force Academy, and eventually became an astronaut. Then the Challenger blew up and NASA and the Air Force parted ways, so he was no longer an astronaut. Instead, he's spent the last 25 years reaching his current position: 3-star general who will most likely be promoted to 4-star and end up running Air Force Space Command or something similar. The trait that I've observed most in him since I met him ten years ago is his unshakeable belief in his ability to get the job done.

I wanted high speed broadband but it was quite expensive at the time (8mbit was about £50/month back then) but I was close enough to the exchange to get it. I bought a wireless access point, set myself up as a linksys reseller and sold WRTs to most of my floor offering unlimited Internet access for £10/month. I then used a Linux box as my gateway for the wireless, split everyone off from my internal network and throttled connections based on the amount they paid.

1823240,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,earbitscom,,,"At my very first internet job, in 1998 or so, I was hired as a temp.  They said they wanted me to find websites that would be good publishers for their content network.  They said to do so by searching AltaVista for sites, and then looking to see if they had a web counter, the kind that say ""You are visitor number XXX"".  If the counter said over 100,000 they considered that a good sized publisher and someone else would be in charge of recruiting them.  In retrospect, of course, there was no indication of how long it had taken the site to get that 100,000 visitors, nor did any good site use the counters much.  But I didn't really know all of that then.<p>So I ask the other temp, ""How do you do this?""  And he says, ""Well, right now I decided to find sports sites, so I just search for the word 'football' and click each result, scroll down, and see if there is a counter over 100,000.""  I said, ""How many do you usually find?""  He says, ""Yesterday, I found 6.""<p>I did this for about 2 minutes until I got smart.  I searched for 'You are visitor number' and instantly got only sites with counters.  Within a few hours I had logged a ton of sites.  At the end of that day, they fired the other temp and asked me to work full time, but the agreement with the temp agency said that they couldn't hire me for 90 days after they let me go.  So, they fired me and told me that I could work from home as an independent contractor for the 90 day period.  They would pay me to keep finding sites, and offered to pay me $10 per site that I found for up to 50 sites per week ($500).  They had no idea I was able to find sites so quickly.<p>I spent the next 90 days building a Rage Against the Machine fan site with my friend at home and, every Friday, I'd spend 20 minutes logging 50 sites using my ""You are visitor number"" technique, drive into the office, drop off my list, and collect my $500 check that they thought I had worked all week to earn.",1287832599

It was only when they got to our class, I realize something was wrong because of something I did, so I timidly said ""I did"".<p>Well, as you might have guessed, what happened was a short-circuit and all the computers in the school couldn't connect to any network anymore.

They didn't find out what was the problem until Monday.<p>The principal asked me why I did it, and I answered ""I was curious.""

Solution: I designed a voucher for PC World giving £25 off the price of the game, and printed it off on an inkjet.
I went to the shop, handed the game and the fake voucher to the cashier, who looked at it with obvious suspicion and told me ""I'm going to get the manager"". At this point I was on the edge of running out of the door, but I held my nerve and tried to look nonchalant. The manager came over and luckily for me her mind seemed to be on other things as she just glanced at the voucher, said ""yeah that's fine"" and walked off. So I paid £14.99, took the game and walked past the security guard out of the store, then sprinted for the next mile in case someone discovered my fraud.

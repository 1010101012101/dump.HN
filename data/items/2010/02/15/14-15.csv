Sweet badges, networking with rich folk and stage decor that helps you ""weave together a fabric that encourages your mind to explore new ideas"" while staring off into space during a boring talk will do that to you, I suppose.<p>If I didn't know that this is just how Scoble writes about everything, I would have come away with a worse opinion of TED than I had going into it. TED is supposedly about ""ideas worth spreading"", not how awesome it is to be rich and white (or fashionably ethnic). If I wanted to know about things rich people do that I will never do, I'd watch <i>My Super Sweet 16</i>. It's no wonder they don't hand out more press passes.<p>I think the way to address complaints of elitism is to not. If being an exclusive event is how the sausage gets made, great. Reasonable people understand that the hype and pretense surrounding TED does not negate the value of the content that it produces. Reasonable people skip the unbearably pompous intro music and the punctuating two minutes of advertisement for things that rich people care about and simply enjoy the talks.

They are finally caring about mobile power management by offloading video processing to dedicated sub-components.  They really are playing catch up here.<p>Apple made the right decision to keep Flash off the iPhone.

At a technical level, sending a response to a request involves telling another machine to pass a message along for you, so there is at least implied consent to copy it and send it to another user. However, what are the bounds of this consent? Can a router store the data it has been passed? For how long? Can it serve it to others besides the IP address the response was intended for?<p>There may be case law and/or actual laws that clarify these points, but I am not a lawyer. I presume you aren't either. If you think the concept of IP law has a straightforward and indisputable application to the internet that clears all questions about what routers can and can't do with the data they are passed, feel free to explain.<p>It seems like you're operating within the ""lots of people do it, so it must be legal somehow"" school of thought when it comes to routing. This isn't necessarily a problem as long as it's applied consistently. Several other commenters and I effectively made the same argument in saying that Google does almost the same thing Scribd does in terms of copying and redistributing content. It isn't possible for you to call that argument invalid then rely on that argument as proof of routing's obvious legality.<p>Scribd is legally indistinguishable from a caching proxy.

Of course most modern music is generated with click tracks, if for nothing else than it makes it easier to edit in Pro Tools, since each track will be aligned with a beat grid, and you can literally cut and paste entire bars of music.<p>This has more to do with the modern way of generating music - get four or five takes of the song from each musician, take the best bars and phrases from each one, and put them all together.  Maybe Britney had a great take on the second take of the chorus, so you just copy/paste that 5 times and now every time the chorus plays it sounds perfect.  Maybe the instrumental solo was perfect the third time, so let's use that one.<p>This also makes you have great appreciation for those bands that recorded music before the advent of modern multi-track recording software, and were somehow dedicated enough to get that one perfect take where everyone in the band did great and nobody made a mistake.",1266242775

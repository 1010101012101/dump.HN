Back in the day everyone <i>did</i> have their own integrated platform.  Microsoft killed every one of them.  Apple only managed to hang on by the skin of their teeth due to the loyalty of their userbase after coasting on their achievements made in the 80s.

He has become increasingly arrogant over the years.<p>Financial contracts <i>per se</i> are amoral. Chu-Carroll claims that a <i>naked CDS</i> is immoral, which is ridiculous. He shows that he does not understand how the financial world works, he passes moral judgements left and right when he should stick to the facts. The ""content"" of his blog post is equivalent to the content you'd get if you read the Wikipedia entries on various structured products.<p>In the end, my problem is not with Chu-Carroll himself, but rather with this dangerous meme that something as complex as structured finance can be summarized in a few blog posts.

I suppose that implies they were simply biding their time waiting for a leak that would make a big enough propaganda splash (he uses the phrase ""maximum political impact"") before showing their hand.<p>It seems we all just projected the role of neutral broker onto them. If nothing else, that shows what a crying need there is for a genuine neutral broker.<p>Edit: If Assange really cared about his stated goal -- maximal political impact -- he would have done better to let the video speak for itself. By spinning it so aggressively, Wikileaks made it easy for people to dismiss the video, and Wikileaks, as products of an ideological agenda. What it did quite effectively, though, is make Assange a celebrity du moment: he got on Colbert for pete's sake.

1281393,comment,1281198,1281198,0,0,j-g-faustus,,,"This is what I am using for a one-person home office:<p>1. Gmail for everything, two accounts (private and work). I found Outlook folders more convenient than Gmail tags, but Gmail is great at being accessible from everywhere and works well enough that setting up my own Outlook server seems a waste of time and money. I have no other archive than Gmail, but if something is especially important (like an order or contract) I save it to the hard drive as well.<p>2. That's a kludge, I haven't really found a good general solution. I have a standard directory structure for projects, and use a central Mercurial versioning system to share code between computers. I use 3-4 editors/IDEs, generally based on which editor has best support for that particular language. At the moment I use NetBeans for JavaScript and Ruby, Xcode for Go and Objective-C, TextWrangler for configuration, scripts etc. and Emacs when on Linux. Builds are generally shell or Ruby scripts.<p>3. Manually. IM is generally turned off, I enable it only for specific conversations by appointment. Leaving it on constantly gives too many interruptions to get anything done.<p>4. I have a Mac mini hooked up to the TV and hi-fi to handle all media. A Linux server provides a few TB media storage. (But this is entertainment, I don't use media for anything related to productivity.)<p>5. All locally. I use a software called CrashPlan which autobackups my two Apple laptops to a central Linux server. On the server rsnapshot runs as a cron job for daily/weekly/monthly backups to an external disk. I would like an offsite or web snapshot as well - I might consider something like Mozy.com for a small subset of the most important data.<p>6. In general: Whatever is simplest and cheapest. For mail and calendar, that's cloud based (Gmail and Google calendar), which also takes care of reconciling. For code, documents and accounting, it's local. Code is shared through Mercurial, documents through a shared folder on the local network. Backups are local mostly due to cost.",1271823507

1281386,comment,1278575,1280703,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"My understanding (haven't put much time into this or implemented so take with a grain of salt): if you refer purchasers to other sites where they make a purchase, you can earn a commission.<p>The most famous example is Amazon. You register. You set up your links to include the referral code. And, via that code, they know to pay you the commission (Google problogger and you'll find articles on using Amazon affiliate marketing through his photo website to earn revenue). (There are caveats, like 'last click' which means they may find it via you, two days later visit via another site, purchase, and the other site gets it. What you lose on the swings you will gain on the roundabout.)<p>There are affiliate networks out there that will set you up with a number of different online retailers. I think most are paying very low amounts, but it scales with traffic. All of these rely on affixing the referral code to the link yourself.<p>Where I got stuck was how to turn user generated links into affiliate links, so a reader could submit (say) a link to a camera sale, and the site would automatically affix your affiliate code to create the commission potential. I found one company (she was based in London - annoyingly can't find the link right now) that had built a system that would do this. Every link on a site would be checked against their database of affiliate marketers, your code would be added, and you could earn the commission.<p>As I say, I only ever got to the early stages and haven't progressed.

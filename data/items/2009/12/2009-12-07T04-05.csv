I was in a situation similar to yours (starting a new job, <i>had</i> to have the machine), and I was told I had to wait for them to repair it.  After a number of back and forth conversations over a day or so and the manager ignoring me for a second time when I tried to appeal in person, I called the hotline.<p>The store called 2 hours later to tell me to pick up a new, updated machine, ready to use with my data transferred over (keep in mind the issue I took the original machine in for was super minor).<p>I know it's anecdotal, but every time I've had to interface with Apple people, it's been nothing but pleasant (even with the App Store).",1260161392

980721,comment,980412,980412,0,0,Xixi,,,"I understand your point. I've work with people at both extremes:<p>- Negative people ruins ambiance and creates resentment. They think everything is doomed, and criticizes everything all the time. Their usual last words : ""Anyway it won't work"".<p>- Cheerleaders as you are calling them refuse to face the real problems, delaying the inevitable until it's too late.<p>None of these attitudes are productive, and they are not held by people who both care and grasp the situation. Sometimes cheerleaders care, they just don't understand what's happening (eg managers who don't understand anything about technology...).<p>By saying ""here's why, and here's how to fix it"", you show that you care, so you're definitely on the right path. The problem is that once you've said ""That sucks"" whoever you are talking to will stop listening. So it doesn't matter whether you say ""That sucks, here's why, and here's how to fix it"", or just ""That sucks"". It's pretty much the same.<p>And that's the hard point. How to make people understand that something is wrong without making them go defensive. A common ""trick"" is honest praise. Honest. It must absolutely be honest otherwise it will fail. Something positive. Just find something great, praise it, and only then you can throw your critic, in a humble way. A critic must never feel like a critic, but more like an encouragement.<p>It might sounds stupid, but it works. It's often easier to have people do a u-turn by pushing them forward.<p>And it will give much more weight to your words when you actually have to throw a ""Well, if we continue like that, we're doomed."". If you are known are someone positive, that will make people think...",1260160846

Even more concerning, the distribution of grants, the peer review process, and the IPCC process are controlled by people like Mann and Phil Jones who study the issue like lawyers prosecuting a case, not like scientists proving a case.  As a result, new scientists who are skeptical have little chance of getting grants, getting published, or getting tenure.  Climate science has the same selection of the process as a priesthood, and that kind of selection process will produce the same errors as a religion.  But right now, there is no alternative source providing funding.  So all we hear about is a ""consensus"" when that consensus is really just a self-replicating group of believers.",1260159507

980699,comment,979501,980055,0,0,mpakes,,,"I strongly disagree.  Proper terminology is <i>incredibly</i> relevant.<p>As stated in the original article, pass-by-value and pass-by-reference have well-known definitions within the computer science community.  There is no ambiguity here.<p>When we excuse the lazy use of such terms incorrectly, we hamper the ability to communicate clearly and effectively.  Please stop.<p>The core misunderstanding seems to be a conflation of 'pass a reference by value' and 'pass-by-reference'.<p>Passing a reference by value != pass-by-reference.  The End.  Q.E.D.<p>Pass-by-reference means that the compiler takes a reference of (or, getting a pointer to) the parameter passed in to the function.  This is not the same as passing an existing reference (pointer) to the function (by value).  Java only allows the latter (primitive types aside).<p>A side issue is that some developers mistakenly believe that pass-by-value roughly implies a deep copy, and thus that the 'spirit' of pass-by-reference is the avoidance of a deep copy.<p>I would posit that many C++ functions that operate on object parameters do so via a pointer (a.k.a. reference) passed by value, just as Java does:<p><pre><code>  void modify_my_object(MyClass *myObject) {
      myObject.setName(""New Name"");
  }

  int main(void) {
      MyClass *myObject = new MyObject(""A Name"");
      modify_my_object(myObject);
      // myObject.name is now ""New Name""
  }
</code></pre>
This is pass-by-value, and there is no deep-copy happening there.<p>Just because many developers don't take advantage of (or don't understand the semantics of) pass-by-reference does not excuse ignorance of the well-known definitions of those terms.",1260159452

I like it.  We've had some problems around the office with lesser models, but several engineers have the nx9420, and I've not heard any complaints or problems.",1231934331

433505,comment,433405,433405,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>every language gets parsed, turned into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), and then compiled or interpreted</i><p>This is one of the most widespread misconceptions about compilers. You don't need to build an AST. All books that give this advice originate from academic environment and are completely out of touch with reality. Unfortunately these books can be credited for the terribly bloated compilers that we are using, including Python and Perl.",1231933665

I.e., when you let them expire they will go back into the pool.<p>I say ""in theory"" because of the possibility that domain name registrars will ""taste"" them <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_tasting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_tasting</a> and/or do something else to ""grab"" them and sell or auction them to the highest bidder in whatever marketplace they can expose the names to.  Other downside is a domain name speculator will acquire and the the same.  All this begs a debate on ""right and wrong,"" which is a whole other topic.",1231933562

I always hate this scapegoating behavior, and also it irks me when for some public disasters a random person gets fired and then supposedly everything has been amended. I don't care about the people about your company, I just want you to not screw up. On the other hand, everybody makes mistakes.",1231933281

It's like saying you're going to start programming in Cobol instead of Python because it might make you rely more on your creative abilities, or you're going to start running in wooden clogs instead of running shoes, or replace your computer display with a 10"" one.  If you want to guide creative thinking, put a constraint on the output, not the toolset.",1231933041

433494,comment,433433,433460,0,0,silencio,,,"Pretty much yeah, as well as twitter search (without having to opt-in, which I believe hashtags.org still requires). But the author's main point seemed to be that hashtags are a solution for easily filtering and tagging tweets appropriately. For example, I was at macworld last week and while I didn't hashtag any tweets, it would be a lot easier for people to filter if I did tag them with something like #mwsf09, instead of tweeting something related without actually mentioning ""mwsf"" or ""macworld"" in the tweet, forcing them to deal with the subsequent issues (i.e. not being able to filter them out or vice versa, not being able to search for it easily...).<p>(Not that I necessarily <i>want</i> to see twitter-side filtering and grouping and permissions, I don't know that I want to given that I love the simplicity of twitter as-is unless twitter can implement it unobtrusively.)",1231931957

6540510,comment,6530536,6538099,5,0,pmarca,,,"My working theory is that consumer ideas are both art and engineering. The art component either takes in the mind of the consumer or it doesn&#x27;t. Like movies or music, sort of. Lots of great engineering teams can&#x27;t get the art to work with high probability, and even the great consumer internet artists swing and miss as often as they hit (eg odeo vs twitter). And if the art doesn&#x27;t take, the engineering won&#x27;t save you.<p>Whereas the enterprise ideas are mostly engineering - or rather the art lies in really understanding the customer and the domain, which is relatively straightforward for the great enterprise entrepreneurs, because they are already so deep in it and you can easily go talk to the customers one at a time and learn what you need to know to predict success or failure with pretty high confidence.

Indeed, it&#x27;s become clear that the social problems caused by prohibition are themselves more pervasive and more destructive than those caused by drugs themselves.<p>But it&#x27;s still wrong to assume that drug use is <i>inherently</i> a social problem: there are plenty of people who can and do use drugs moderately, while still remaining peaceful and productive members of society, and these people are victims <i>only</i> of prohibition, not of the drugs themselves.<p>We should be careful about what we recognize as contributing factors to social problems at the macro level, especially where those influences affect the macro-level society only by way of willful human behavior.  <i>Everything</i> might be rightly construed as a potential influence on human behavior, and <i>anything</i> taken to excess might inspire dangerous or irresponsible behavior; but it&#x27;s very dangerous to treat human beings as fungible stimulus-response machines, and locate the nexus of responsibility for outcomes in the complex of external behavioral influences rather than in human agency itself.

The best way is to make close local friends and get them to do all your ordering or negotiations for you. Normally food and drink prices are clearly written and are not over-priced unless you&#x27;re at a tourist destination. Taxis are meant to always take meter so you should never take cabs unless they go by the meter. Some tourist-congested places are notorious for this (i.e. Platinum Shopping Center and Chatuchak Weekend Market), but it&#x27;s quite easy to walk a little further from the main location and grab a meter cab.

Those are just 5 patents they asserted in that one lawsuit. The portfolio they actually license probably has hundreds and maybe even thousands in it. They only asserted these 5 because a) it&#x27;s practically impossible to sue over more than a few patents, and b) they thought these were the likeliest to get B&N on.<p>2. I am not sure what the &quot;ridiculously high license fees&quot; were... Were they ever even revealed? To my knowledge, the actual terms of any of their Android deals is not known to this day, and the $10/phone figure is complete speculation. This is true of almost any IP licensing deal by any company in the world ever. These deals are typically closely guarded trade secrets. My hunch is, MS is actually licensing for a lot less than $10/phone, and is instead negotiating for a stronger commitment from manufacturer&#x27;s on the Windows Phone front.<p>3. Patents give holders a right to sue others if they infringe. Infringers can try to avoid lawsuits by negotiating a license. Or they can argue that they don&#x27;t infringe or the patent is invalid, which often (but not always) ends up in court. That is how the patent system was designed to work. Microsoft chose to use it by negotiating licenses for the most part. Apple chose to not license and used their right to sue instead. Now one may complain about the quality of the patents involved, but...<p>4. ...On what basis did you judge those patents to be &quot;terrible&quot;? Really, I am curious as to what you think the patent covers and why it&#x27;s terrible. I ask because the default for tech media or HN is that all patents are &quot;terrible&quot; but when I drill down into it, most people are woefully uninformed about how they work. It&#x27;s actually quite difficult to truly evaluate the quality of a patent. From a legal perspective, it requires reading not only the patent, but the entire file wrapper including all the cited prior art, the office actions and the applicant&#x27;s responses. From a layman&#x27;s perspective, judging the novelty of something, especially if it&#x27;s old, is difficult because it&#x27;s very difficult to envision the state of the art at the time of filing and appreciate what is being claimed; things too easily appear obvious in hindsight, and some of the patents on there are from <i>1994</i>!",1381612945

6540371,comment,6540030,6540030,22,0,jamornh,,,"Thai national here, and as a fellow bootstrapper I would have to agree with most of the points of the OP. The reason why I left my well-paid job in Singapore and come back to Thailand to bootstrap my startup is due to the much lower cost of living and un-tapped talent pool.<p>I&#x27;d like to add that the quoted figure of $1,000 USD a month is rather high. Most Thais can get by with $500 USD. That is the current starting salary for undergraduates. Now, keep in mind that if you are a foreigner, there will definitely be a surcharge since it is expected that you are able to afford more. As a local, I can cheaply rent an apartment outside of Bangkok (granted without a pool) for $100-150 USD a month. If you include utilities, phone, and internet you might need around $250-$350 USD, and you will get air conditioning.<p>EDIT: As for food, his mentioned price of 40 Baht for a bow of chicken rice which has now supposedly increased by 25%. It feels slightly over priced to me, but not by much. The average cost of a bow of food is still around 30-40 Baht ($1 USD to $1.33 USD) per serving and have not increased, as far as I can tell, for the 2 years that I have been back. So if you&#x27;re pretty frugal, you can definitely get by with $5-7 USD a day for food + drinks. If you really want to go for &quot;ramen diets&quot; then you can definitely get by with lower IMO.<p>The current going prices for co-working spaces in Thailand are around $7 - $10 a day, net, and most of these places open 7 days a week. But if you can work from home, you can ignore that cost.<p>Regarding the OP&#x27;s point about the startup scene, he is correct. It&#x27;s very much in its infancy and the local work-force are not as familiar with the startup ecosystem and are very risk averse. To add to that, most employees will not understand how equity work and will prefer to work for a safer and more secure jobs. This is a cultural thing so pushing the startup mentality is still a big hurdle that the great people at Launchpad and HUBBA are trying their best to overcome.<p>Overall I&#x27;m quite optimistic about the way Thailand is moving with regards to startups, but it is very much in its infancy and founders are not as well-informed. A lot of incubators and &quot;startup schools&quot; are in it for the fact that it seems like the cool thing to be doing, but most have no idea how to run one and no experience in the space. IMO, there isn&#x27;t much right now that the founders can gain from the partnership since both sides are basically feeling their way around.<p>In the end though, I can&#x27;t recommend Thailand enough as a place that you should come and bootstrap just for the cost of living, wonderful culture, and an assortment of holiday locations. Although, as a Thai, I may be completely biased.<p>EDIT: Of course, I&#x27;m not exactly familiar with the visa situation since I don&#x27;t actually need it. Based on the OP, it seems pretty complicated, but still worth the hassle.",1381612833

I don&#x27;t have a team, I&#x27;m not an Engineer and it seems like there are two groups who benefit: coders hoping to win a beauty contest in front of investors and investors who see it as a cheap way to find creative labor. Am I wrong? What would I do if I just showed up at one of these? The Launch Festival looks quite interesting though... It&#x27;s not till Feb, but I&#x27;ll buy a ticket for sure.<p>The Lean Startup is a good book -- I read it last night to re-familiarize myself with the ideas. MVP, &quot;getting outside the building&quot;, innovation accounting and Measure-Learn-Build are extremely useful concepts. As you suggested, some of my thoughts revolve around the ideal order of the steps. But beyond that, I believe there&#x27;s more accurately a crucial missing step up front. I have no doubt that he wants you to measure stuff, refine and then re-measure to see if there&#x27;s better alignment, until you&#x27;ve developed a solid &#x27;customer archetype&#x27;. But it seems that you&#x27;re sort of tainting the initial conversation with prospects by forcing it down the path of discussing what&#x27;s right and wrong with your MVP. How likely are you to throw it all out and start from scratch if your MVP just isn&#x27;t cutting it? You have to have serious fortitude to do that, especially if your MVP took many weeks or months to develop. And aren&#x27;t most prospects just going to think &#x27;inside the box&#x27; once you&#x27;ve placed a potential solution in front of them?<p>So I suspect that what often happens when employing the Build-Measure-Learn paradigm is that either you end up with incremental improvements to existing solutions or eventual success ends up depending on how good you were at really nailing that initial MVP... and that could require Steve Jobs-like intuition or plain luck.<p>What if you could put a reliable methodology around those crucial, very early conversations with prospects that would lead you to build an MVP that meets their basic needs up front without any kind of super-human foresight or luck and without having to pivot over and over (which I contend is mentally a very hard thing for most people to do)?<p>To go with the Lean Startup nomenclature, my idea could sort of be summed up as Discover-Build-Measure-Learn, at which point you&#x27;d cycle through Build-Measure-Learn after the first iteration.",1381611898

To do otherwise leads to poor quality and major hurdles that are not worth the effort to overcome.<p>* So if I were going to develop a Windows app, I&#x27;d use the native Windows toolkit (whatever that is these days, I&#x27;d have to research).<p>* And besides, Schwartz takes advantage of several 10.8 Cocoa/AppKit APIs, and is of course completely entwined with my Xcode 5 project.

I mean no slight to Canadians, but if we are going to overspend by 100x, let&#x27;s at least send the money to our cronies in the United States!  Just for appearances.",1381611688

As I get older, however, I&#x27;ve learned that trying things is always good. See what happens!<p>My question would simply be: how would this be any different than using a small contractor? Or having really great people in a small team do the same thing?<p>In other words, what does a new organization and standards bring to the table that&#x27;s not already there? Simply a new name? What do they do that you currently cannot do separately if you wanted to? Are you really suggesting something new, or just adding a bunch of buzzwords together in an effort to try to make something sound good? Or, to be even more provocative, is the goal here to actually do something, or create something that sounds like it might do something? Because they&#x27;re two different things. We&#x27;ve been down this road of &quot;Ok, let&#x27;s set aside this special group, with these special criteria, and a new name&quot; a hundred times. Best case -- it works at a very small scale. Worst case, same old, same old, just with new titles over all the stuff.",1381611687

I realize that only makes sense for sufficiently large setups, but once your setup is large enough, it does make things easier.<p>At $work we maintain setups for customers, and our FQDNs are roughly <function><counter><environment>.<customer>.<ourdomain>.tld. So the second database server in the testing environment for customer &quot;nasa&quot; (hypothetical, of course) would be called db02t.nasa.<ourdomain>.<tld>.<p>It does make it pretty obvious from the FQDN what the used is being used for.",1381611687

I much prefer boring but logical descriptors that help my network self-document: whether simple codes useful in small environments (like &quot;file01&quot;) or more complex schemes suitable for large-scale computing (e.g., &quot;masip150ntvirt&quot; or &quot;cin-me-exch-01&quot;).  With the right scheme, 15 characters can tell you a lot about the location, ownership, configuration, and purpose of a particular computer.  The cutesy naming conventions do nothing to help admins do their jobs or - in my opinion - actively get in the way.",1381611675

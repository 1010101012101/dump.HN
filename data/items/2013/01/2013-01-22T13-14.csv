5097076,comment,5095643,5096778,2,0,brianchu,,,"I very clearly made the point that casual gaming != mobile gaming. The rise of mobile gaming does not mean the death of hardcore games. There is no reason hardcore games can't exist on mobile. Console-type hardcore games are already showing up on smartphones. Like I said, once smartphones catch up with consoles and wirelessly connect to your television/external gamepad (the latter already being a reality), smartphones will be able to do 95% of what consoles do. The point is that CoD five years from now may very well be on your smartphone-television-gamepad setup.<p>In fact, your example perfectly illustrates the potential of mobile gaming (casual gaming particularly). First: getting CoD requires buying a $200 console and paying $60 for the game. That's huge. That requires a kind of commitment (i.e. ""I plan on buying and playing lots of games to make the console worth it"") that few customers have.<p>Second: I'm reluctant to hew to stereotypes, but hardcore gamers are overwhelmingly male. In saying that your under-10 kid would go nuts for CoD, you seem to be assuming that <i>he</i> is not going to be a female. That's nearly 50% of the population that's ignored. Yes, I personally know many girls who play FPS's. But the fact remains that girls are overwhelmingly unlikely to play FPS's, relative to guys.<p>Who stopped at just Pokemon? The vast majority of women (iPad board games sell particularly well among females). Most (but obviously not all) adult men. Basically any people who gave up video games or never really got into them - the vast majority of the population. Let me give you a data point. Me. I used to play tons of games - Halo, CoD, PC MMOs, etc. Due to school and then working at a startup, I've stopped. Now I only have time for quick game sessions when I'm waiting in line, riding in the car/bus/train, and taking quick breaks from work.<p>Hardcore games capture a tiny slice of the total market. The potential of mobile gaming lies precisely in the fact that every demographic is accessible.<p>On an unrelated note, I'd like to correct a typo in my previous post. When I said ""a shift of console-quality games from mobile to console,"" I meant ""console to mobile.""",1358863132

I always have had these projects that I can't forget off.
There have been various, but after I matured, I ended up focusing in two.<p>They are still early, I have been unable to dedicate on them as much as I would have liked. 
Because I have lived most of my life with limited means. I used to not own a computer, nor internet. 
While I worked to save my family from poverty, all I could afford to do, was to buy books,
and learn programming, and work on my projects in theory.<p>It took a long time, but now I am relatively well off, and have a great full time work.
I am advancing my projects, but it is too slow. I am considering to at some point,
to take maybe a full year or two, to focus on my projects.<p>My two (still early) projects are:<p>Reproduce the human mind, and emotions, in a computer. Human like AI: <a href=""http://www.ozkeebo.com/soul.project/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ozkeebo.com/soul.project/</a>
This is a problem that have fascinated me since child. 
I have meditated a lot on it, and have this hunch that I can pull it off.
I am the kind of crazy and weird person, perfect for it. But I know that it is a hard problem.
Maybe I will never be able to complete it, but at least I am sure that I will get great things out of it.
Let's see how I will be doing in 10 or 20 years.<p>My other project, is a graphical programming language. This comes from my dissatisfaction in
how we express programming languages. I feel like I want to shout to the world, that we are missing a
huge opportunity here. I feel like we could be doing much better than what we have.
But it is a lot of work, and it will also take me years of work, to prove if I really have a point.
I will see.<p>Thanks for a great article, and a great hn thread anyway.",1358862676

A 6-8 person studio will <i>still</i> easily run up $1m in operating costs a year, before we even get to PR and marketing.<p>So say you get your development cycle down to a science and can squeeze out an excellent game every year - that's $1mm of dev costs + marketing.<p>At $0.99 a pop that's nearly 1.4 million copies needed to break even on dev costs, more if you wish to recoup marketing.

If I was talking about a highly-experimental cancer treatment, I doubt you'd nitpick the price. Doubly-so if you had cancer. In fact, I bet you'd do your best to estimate its effectiveness.<p>I didn't quote the cheapest price. I quoted what I pay. I have no idea how much older people pay for life insurance. If you looked at their website, you'd see that Alcor dues are $800/year. Neuropreservation is $80k and whole-body is $200k (<a href=""http://alcor.org/BecomeMember/scheduleA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alcor.org/BecomeMember/scheduleA.html</a>). This may sound like a lot, but the standard way to pay is to buy life insurance. When you die, the policy pays Alcor. You can see the cost break-down in my GP comment.<p>Alcor is expensive. Cryonics Institute is the budget option. CI dues are $120/year and whole-body preservation costs $35k. CI members usually pay with life insurance as well. CI can charge less because they have less staff. Their research budget is practically zero. Most importantly, they won't camp at your deathbed. IIRC, Eliezer is signed up with CI and pays around $300/year. <i>That's</i> the cheapest price possible.<p>It's often said that getting cryopreserved is the second-worst thing that can happen to you. Cryonics gives you a small chance of living a much longer life. I'll be the first to admit that it's highly unlikely to work. But for myself and many others, the expected value calculation heavily favors signing up.

It's cursed. I pulled the plug repeatedly for different reasons:<p>First time I started developing it, after a few months, a high-profile/highly-funded Open Source project with exactly the same features announced itself. I didn't want to spend time on something with so famous a competitor, it just didn't seem reasonable to duplicate/waste effort like that. If I'm honest, I was also kind of pissed that I was having such a hard time convincing people my thing was worthwhile, and then those guys come along and suddenly everyone acts like it's the most groundbreaking thing ever!<p>Second time, I started up again when the famous Open Source project kept drifting aimlessly somewhere between success and failure with no clear vision. I even enrolled in nReduce, mostly to keep me on schedule and make contact with like-minded developers. Then my mother got sick and died last year, that was the end of the project right then and there as I wasn't able to continue at that time. Maybe her death should have driven me even harder to develop this project, but the sad fact is that I just disintegrated unproductively.<p>Now I have to ask myself if I should ever continue this project. On the one hand it's not <i>that</i> ambitious, so it won't really take forever. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that I won't be able to pull this off (considering the two attempts before). Wouldn't my time be better spent to start something completely new?

The tradeoff is robustnesscan't lose or corrupt data as long as the master data set is safeand flexibilitygenerate whatever views you like on the data whenever you choose. The design is Twitter's analytics system which was running this sort of thing over a 27TB raw dataset using Hadoop so apparently it scales if you throw more hardware at it.<p>There's a second layer using Storm (not written up in the book yet, so I don't know the details) that handles all data newer than the most recent batch run and you somehow merge that new data with the old data (also not written up yet). I don't need to have this sort of system implemented immediately so I'm content to sit around and wait for new book chapters rather than try to muddle through.",1358860144

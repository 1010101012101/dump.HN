1333526,comment,1332859,1333441,0,0,EdwardCoffin,,,"In 2006 I purchased from Amazon the special edition of Vernor Vinge's ""A Fire Upon the Deep"", an Adobe eBook (the only way this special edition was available).  Last year, when I went to have another look at the eBook on my latest computer (not the one I originally purchased the book on), I found that it no longer worked: I could not enable the book on my new computer because Amazon's license server for Adobe eBooks no longer worked.  It took me several back-and-forth emails with Amazon's customer support to get someone to admit that once Amazon moved over to the Kindle, support for the Adobe ebooks went away (most of them didn't even seem to be aware that there were eBooks prior to the Kindle).  I'd have settled for them replacing my eBook with the Kindle equivalent, but I don't own a Kindle.  At the time there was no Kindle eBook reader for OS X.  I eventually got a refund, but it took a lot of work to get them to even recognize that there was a problem.  Additionally, I didn't <i>want</i> a refund, I wanted to read the special content in this special version of the book, one that is not available in paper.  Given that experience, I'm a bit reluctant to purchase the Kindle version, even though there is apparently an OS X reader now.<p>I think the thing that most disturbs me about this whole incident is not just that a book I bought <i>stopped working</i> it is that I had no indication that it had become unavailable to me <i>until the instant I went to re-read it</i>.  It had probably been inaccessible for months if not years without me knowing, with me thinking that I had the book ready for me to go read whenever I felt like, but when I went to check on something, it just didn't work.  My shelves of paper books don't present me with that kind of problem.",1273463896

If you're paying attention while you're working through math problems, programming assignments, etc., patterns emerge and you quickly realize what constants are important, which programming methods you should remember the argument order to (or keyword/symbol names), etc.<p>I guess I understand (begrudgingly) the necessity to memorize something for a high school math test where you don't have the resources at your disposal to actually find the answers yourself, but in the ""real world"" where finding the information you're looking for is so quick and inexpensive, it seems like a waste to invest in something that might not be necessary. (Also, for some people who don't have the skills to think through solving those problems on their own, it could be a pretty big disservice.)<p>I can't even begin to remember how many constants, dates, formulas, names, etc. that I've memorized for a test and then promptly forgot.",1273463651

1333508,comment,1332859,1332859,0,0,URSpider94,,,"There is an interesting meta-discussion going on here, over whether content curators add value.  Most of the hackers that I've met tend to believe that they would prefer to latch onto a raw content stream, then filter and format it to their liking.  No surprise -- that is the way of hackers, after all.<p>However, I do think that it's a conceptual mistake to assume that the public at large would like to filter their own content.  Even music sales, which are pretty far down the road towards an openly accessible market, are still driven by the major and minor labels.  For books, I see an even stronger incentive to keep paying others to filter our content.  Reading is a big investment, time-wise -- when people curl up with a book, e- or paper, they want to know that it's going to be worth their time.

1333482,comment,1332954,1333251,0,0,carbocation,,,"While correct in some details, yours is an incorrect description of the bigger picture of glucose catabolism. Pyruvate is consumed the TCA (Krebs) cycle, so to say that you only need a ""little"" is like saying you only need a ""little"" gas to run your car. Your car runs on gas, consuming it. The Krebs cycle runs on pyruvate, consuming it.<p>Glucose gets broken down into pyruvate via glycolysis, which is by far the primary way in which you generate pyruvate. This process generates a bit of energy, but the vast majority of ATP is generated during the Krebs cycle, which is where glucose metabolites (namely, pyruvate) get oxidized into CO2 and H20.<p>To respond more directly to your point: if 80% of glucose is immediately metabolized to CO2 and H20 (I don't recall but I'll take your word), that means that 80% of glucose enters the body, <i>undergoes glycolysis</i>, and then enters the TCA cycle. This means that 80% of the glucose in your body is quickly converted into fructose (yes, F6P). You could easily make this into a pure fructose molecule with a phosphatase (though this doesn't happen in vivo).

There are plenty of good apps for notetaking, drawing, even writing. I've switched from my MacBook Pro to the iPad for those tasks as it's <i>much</i> lighter. The soft keyboard takes some getting used to, but it's the same size (in landscape) as the external Apple keyboards, and it's plenty easy to type on after getting used to not having physical feedback. (I've already typed a 3-page paper on it.)<p>For a CS degree, though, there are a few downsides. The iPad doesn't have any good coding software yet, and you'll be doing <i>a lot</i> of that. Labs aren't a great solution, either. Do you really want to have to leave the comfort of your own room to do homework? My school (University of Missouri) has a Unix account for every student, and I've been able to SSH in to accounts there to do some coding, but it's nowhere near as good as having a GUI editor, especially if you aren't used to vi or a similar editor. You'll definitely want something with a traditional OS on it for coding purposes, at least for now. Who knows, in the future, someone may make a decent IDE for the iPad, and the point will be moot. For now, it's not a great option.<p>The ""power combo"" is an interesting idea, and it's pretty much what I'm doing now, but with a MacBook Pro in place of the Mac mini, as I've stopped taking my MBP to most classes, opting for the iPad instead. The only downside to this is that you're stuck without a laptop in the case that you have to meet with a group to work on an assignment outside of class. I don't know what college you're planning on going to, but the labs at my college fill up fast and most people usually end up meeting in a generic ""commons"" area and using laptops to work on projects. Like I said, though, you'll be fine with the iPad for anything except coding.<p>Depending on the way your school acts, an iPad may be just fine. I don't know the number of group projects you'll be doing and the order your classes will go in. In my freshman year, we had a ton of ""fluff"" classes early on, where I wasn't doing any coding. The iPad will be fine for those courses. Of your options, I'd definitely lean towards the ""power combo"", but if it's an option, I'd start the semester with <i>just</i> the iPad. Give it a few weeks, see if it's working out for you. If you've got too much going on, and you find yourself hitting the labs more than you'd like, add the mini. The reason for going without is to allow yourself to make sure you're using the full potential of the iPad, and that you aren't relying too heavily on the other computer as a crutch. If you end up needing that crutch, I'd stick with your current, busted laptop before giving in and buying the mini. Ubuntu's going to be a great for the early classes (assuming that your school will start with Java, like most do), and you may be able to eke a few more years out of the hardware. Trust me, the early years are not going to require a huge amount of processing power or memory. 1.6GHz will be more than enough to compile 20 lines of Java. :P<p>Conclusion: Start with the iPad. Use your busted laptop if you need to. Only if those two options combined are a problem, go for the mini. If you can hold out through your freshman year with just the iPad and laptop, I'm sure someone will have released an iPad IDE by then, and you'll be golden. People have started releasing web ""IDEs"" already, so it's only a matter of time.<p>No matter what, have fun at college. It's a great time.",1273460875

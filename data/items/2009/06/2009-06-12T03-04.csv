654138,comment,652650,654070,0,0,crocowhile,,,"The ""saving energy"" idea was out in the 80's, mainly put forward by Rechtschaffen and colleagues but it was abandoned the moment people realized that a sleeping brain does not consume much less energy than the awake brain. In fact the energy consumption during REM is identical to during wakefulness (REM sleep is called also paradoxical sleep because the EEG looks very very similar to a fully working brain), and energy consumption during NREM is about 10% less than awake - absolutely not enough to justify evolutionary the need for sleep. The amount of energy that you save with one night of sleep is estimated to be bit less than one frankfurter bun.<p>After centuries of interest we still don't know why we sleep. We have no idea, really. We know rats die if you sleep deprive them for long enough (between 10-30 days) but we don't know what they die of. I work with fruitflies myself and investigating sleep function is what I am trying to do.",1244778665

Most Chinese people, like most Americans, are interested mainly in their own country. All around them is more information about China and things Chinese than they could possibly take in. The newsstands are bulging with papers and countless glossy magazines. The bookstores are big, well stocked, and full of patrons, and so are the public libraries. Video stores, with pirated versions of anything. Lots of TV channels. And of course the Internet, where sites in Chinese and about China constantly proliferate. When this much is available inside the Great Firewall, why go to the expense and bother, or incur the possible risk, of trying to look outside?</i><p>The same points arguably hold for the Green Dam.<p>Edit: I guess I missed the point of the advisory (see comment below). I assumed they were discussing methods of circumventing the system, but after a second (more careful) reading, that's obviously not the biggest concern.<p>It's really a crappy situation: mandated software that's this broken.

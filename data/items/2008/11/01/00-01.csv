Looking further into it, the Countach had been built since 1974, but they never applied for this US design patent until Lamborghini was bought by Chrysler in 1989. By 1992, when it was actually granted, the Countach had already been discontinued.<p>Wait... looking at the pictures again, I'm pretty sure that's actually the Lamborghini Diablo -- that would make more sense with respect to the timing, since it was made from 1990 to 2001.",1225501150

If instead of just copying a DVD, you hired actors, cameras, lighting and props and made a short-by-shot remake of your favourite movie, and then promised not to make any further copies of it, you'd be analogous to this guy.<p>Or, I'm reminded of that guy in that Borges story who spends his whole life trying to rewrite Don Quixote from scratch.",1225500448

Unfortunately, this has proven to be virtually impossible. However, it is an example of the action in derivatives that many brokerage companies use.</i><p>Although different, this reminds me of the ""guaranteed to win"" casino strategy where you keep doubling your bets.  This fails for two reasons:<p>* Losing streaks can be very long and requires that you have access to a large sum of money since the bets are growing exponentially.<p>* House limits prevents you from doubling indefinitely",1225500278

The idea is by the time they have to return the stock the price will have fell.<p>Ie, if the stock is currently worth $100, and they borrow 1 share and immediately sell it, they have $100 and owe 1 share. Later, on the date they have to return 1 share, they go and buy 1 share and give it back. If the share price then is $80 they made $20 on the transaction. If the stock went up to $120 then they lost $20.<p>So, they shorted the stock, because they thought it would go down, but then the amount of stock available to be bought plunged right as they had to return the stock. So, there was a huge demand for the stock right as the supply was drying up. As such, the price went very high, but they were forced to buy it anyways to due to the previous agreement (that they had to give the stock back).",1225499135

There is a good reason why app layer is used almost universally.<p>Another way to simplify people's life would be using something like Oracle's Berkeley DB.  Small app layer, with embeded database that can be called with simple api calls, makes more sense.  No SQL, no separate database to maintain, yet it is a very powerful persistence layer.  It would be just as easy to distribute, plus you can do your own custom coding, and fancy stuff that CouchDB would not be able to provide.",1225498201

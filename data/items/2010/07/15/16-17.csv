Most people who have experience with one, either love them or hate them.<p>You are correct that I didn't address the 'I have no experience with a lisp' crowd at all. I was specifically addressing those who have some experience with a lisp.<p>If you don't like lisp, I suspect that something like Scala would probably be more to your liking. I'd be very interested to hear from people who use clojure and enjoy it after not liking lisp before starting. I suspect they are few and far between, but I'm open to the idea that all of clojure's pluses ( ease of concurrency, ability to tap into java libraries etc ) might win people over.",1279213106

Many (if not most due to scale) of the people who are rooting their phones are not developers/tinkerers. I was talking to a very non-technical person the other day and they said a friend had sent them instructions on how to jailbreak their iPhone. This person just followed the instructions and then was able to download a navigation app for free.

1518339,comment,1517931,1517931,0,0,yason,,,"Clojure is a lisp and a lisp is rarely just another language.<p>If you don't know lisp or you don't want to know why you should know lisp, go take Scala or Haskell or Python. If, however, you do know—or you're willing to read a handful of Paul Graham's essays on lisp—let's continue:<p>Most importantly, Clojure is a lisp that is 1) not a toy, 2) not too standalone without a supported platform, and 3) not Common Lisp.<p>1) Most lisps are toys. It is logical because lisps are fun, profound, and nearly everyone (out of a certain demographic) has written a few. Then there are various Common Lisps, Scheme lisps, Emacs Lisp, and then few others that come as a part of some fairly important software library, and those aren't toys but usable at least in some specific environments. Clojure is a full-blown language that has actual development history past the ""gee, i think this is going to be interesting"" phase.<p>2) libraries and compatibility are so important these days. The Python language is gold because it has a fairly extensive standard library and bindings to nearly everything, even if it isn't a lisp. Most lisps have marginal effect and impact because they are so disconnected from the 2000's state of affairs. They're only drawn from the chambers and wielded in superimportant projects where the cost of building a suitable environment to host the lisp system is negligible to the actual problem to be solved.<p>3) Common Lisp was a good, practical, multi-paradigm lisp by the 80's standards. (Ok, path abstraction could've just worked everywhere right from the start.) But the technology ship has sailed 15 years ago and CL wasn't on it. So far, Common Lisp has been the best we lispers have got. But now that there's Clojure, it doesn't matter we lispers weren't on the ship because with Clojure we just got a jet flight to fifteen years in the future. And I don't think we even saw the ship sailing below during our flight.",1279212950

If you are forced to use Java (as is the case on Android), Clojure would probably be really sweet.",1279212915

Though even there there are ways of reducing the risk of doing so; for example, cross-validation is commonly used to test whether discovered correlations are artifacts of sampling or not, and has some pretty solid statistical theory behind it.<p>But in this case the general hypothesis is pre-chosen and fixed, basically ""men who watch TV more hours [whatever] more than men who watch TV fewer hours"", and the choice of threshholds is more of a reporting step, pulling out some binned tails at either extreme for emphasis and ease of discussion, while the real correlation is full-curve-to-full-curve.",1279212499

1518307,comment,1518281,1518281,0,0,prosa,,,"It sounds like you want an LLC.  The main reason to choose a C Corp is to support equity investment.<p>With an LLC you literally own a percent of the company, rather than a number of shares (which equates to a percent).  This can be bought or sold just like shares.  However, you may choose to put restrictions on exactly what circumstances one of you can sell, and to whom, and with what provisions.  Often, the other partner gets right-of-first-refusal to buy at the price that you were about to sell it at.  This would be fine in your case, since your partner is your target.<p>LLCs can divest their profits to shareholders at the end of each fiscal year, at which point it is taxed as personal income.  With a corporation, this would be considered a dividend.  Dividends are ""post-income"" -- they are paid from profits, not revenue.  This means that the money is taxed as corporate profit (15%) before it reaches you.  Then you are taxed again as an individual.<p>Furthermore with a C Corp you pick up a bunch of reporting requirements.  For starters, you need a Board of Directors, and you are required to have an Annual Meeting, the minutes of which must be filed with the government.<p>I'm not sure about financials.  My understanding is that as a member of an LLC you are privy to all of that, but you can do a lot with the operating agreement to change defaults, so make sure you have your own counsel if your partner is the one drawing up the docs.",1279212227

I don't have the low-level details, but this should be enough to make an informed decision.<p>He was working on what he termed ""high speed automated trading"" -- basically all in this realm of picking pennies up in front of bulldozers.<p>He's a very smart and talented guy -- Harvard Physics/Comp. Sci double major, etc.  So we're not talking about an amateur throwing around some code.<p>He spent about 6 months and over $50k setting up his system -- he had developed some algorithms to trade spreads between different securites (on the CBOE, the NYSE, and NASDAQ).  He built a relationship with a clearing agent, a direct broker, etc.  He got machines in colo facilities as close to the exchanges as possible (one data center in Chicago, one in Jersey City, etc.)  SLAs on low-latency DS3 lines, etc.  The whole nine yards.<p>I'd call it a ""pro-sumer"" level setup -- everything done by one guy, but done basically as well as a bigger firm would set it all up.<p>Here's what he discovered after about a week of trading:  He didn't have even remotely a shot at competing.  Like, not even close.  If he had 10ms pings to the exchanges, someone else had 5ms.  If he got down to 2ms, someone else who was physically at the exchange itself had 1ms.  He got killed with commissions -- even if he did make a few $$ on some trades, it vanished with commissions.<p>Why?  Because he was competing against guys who paid NO commissions.  The broker-dealers and clearing companies themselves had internal automated trading setups.  They had deeper relationships and deals that traded commissions for a cut of the profits, etc.<p>In other words, he figured out pretty quickly that this is not an algorithm game or speed game - it, like many things on Wall Street - is a 'who you know' game.  No matter how smart, how fast, how sophisticated you are as an outsider, the likelihood is that someone on the inside has a similar trade idea and can do it faster and cheaper than you.<p>Now, the corollary to that:  My friend is smart, but he also tends to give up too easily ;)  Clearly if you've got an idea for a better/smarter/more innovative trade, then you'll make money on it.  But that's a trade idea, not a speed advantage.<p>So just recognize that there's potential to make money, but ""same idea, just faster"" won't cut it.",1279211780

Someone comes to me with an idea, my shop builds it for them for a fee- deal done. Since this scenario is a little different, I'd like to get your collective input from past experiences before I start talking to a contract attorney.<p>Recently I was approached by a business man who wanted a project developed. We started working out a spec, I gave him a quote, and he gave me a counter-offer that was pretty fair and offered some equity (10%) to make up for the difference between my initial price and his counter. Normally, I'd start cutting features, take his counter offer, and tell him to keep his equity. But this guy has an _uncanny_ ability to build buzz and successful (profitable) products.<p>This is a SaaS type deal which will be profitable from day one. There's no way we're going to be a target for acquisition or IPO, but I think it's probably going to do 100k < net income < 250k in the first year. (At which point I'm hoping to sell my shares back to him.)<p>What kind of corporate structure should we choose? I know everyone says C-corp in Delaware, but we're not raising any $. Should we still go with a C-corp? How would liquidation/transfer of this stock work? If I sell my shares to my partner, is it taxed as long-term capital gains?<p>How would owners draw work? Am I immediately entitled to 10% of the profits the second we become profitable? Is there a buffer period before I'm able to draw? Do we agree in advance on how much money gets reinvested into the business? I'd imagine that'd be his call since he's the majority holder, but is there a way to guarantee a percentage of profits I can draw out on a regular basis? What's the convention here?<p>As a partner, am I entitled to inspect the books whenever I feel like it? I don't have any reason to believe he'd screw me but I'd like to cover my bases rather than have things get messy later on.<p>Thanks guys! :)",1279211641

I'm not sure how high school science teachers fit into this; sounds like you had a bad experience and I'm sorry if so, but that really has nothing to do with this discussion.<p>There is nothing wrong with ""my thinking"" but you appear to think so because your understanding is incorrect. <i>Post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> is the fallacy of thinking that, because something comes before another, that first something causes the second. I'm not talking about that at all. <i>Post hoc</i> analysis is something totally different - viz, it's performing non-prespecified analyses. It's more closely coupled to multiple testing than it is to the other fallacy you are referring to. It certainly is not limited to small sample sizes or sample sizes of one, in contrast to what you state. You can do science improperly with samples of any size.",1279210202

We can infer from this picture that companies are sitting on their money and spending frugally. They did so in the early 2000s as well. SOX explains why it's hard for a small-to-mid-cap to break out, but it doesn't explain why existing big businesses would restrict their spending.<p>My conjecture, which I don't have a watertight case for, is that business(as a whole) doesn't want to grow, or can increasingly meet growth targets via productivity alone, and so the whole rationale driving IPOs - and the capital/labor side of the economy - is broken.",1279210064

They came down to 100 min which was still more than double my other options.  At this point when I said it was higher than I was comfortable with, the sales rep started asked me ""what would you propose?""<p>I wasn't sure how to answer that, but when I finally answered ""how about matching or nearly matching the minimum given by x"" (which was around 40 a month minimum) and I'll sign up today. At that point, the salesperson sent me a miffed-sounding response saying they can't go below the 100 a month minimum (why ask what I propose, then?) and walked away from the negotiation. YMMV.<p>edit: checked my emails with them and edited for accuracy",1241744264

The biochemistry of how HDAC inhibitors work is over my head, but the neuroscience is quite intriguing and promising.<p>Here's what they say about HDAC inhibitors in the abstract of the 2007 paper: ""Moreover, increased histone acetylation by inhibitors of histone deacetylases induced sprouting of dendrites, an increased number of synapses, and 
reinstated learning behaviour and access to long-term memories"".<p>That paper showed that the effects of HDAC inhibitors were similar to environmental enrichment in recovering and preventing the loss of memories. The interesting part is that they do not prevent neuronal loss by brain atrophy; memory improves in the mice <i>despite</i> severe atrophy.<p>If you're interested, the article I'm referring to is: Fischer et al.

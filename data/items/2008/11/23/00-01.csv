But Desai told me about a partnership that will take this farther. A satellite-TV company called Echostar, working with credit-reporting company Equifax, will cross-reference shows watched (using its own data from set-top boxes) with income and buying habits (using Equifax's data).</i><p>I love the eighties: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBd7bHFnO4Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBd7bHFnO4Y</a>",1227401964

373342,comment,373302,373302,0,0,aneesh,,,"I'm certainly no expert on TV advertising, but it seems to be a much harder market to break into than the web.  The cost of producing ads is much higher, and the ROI is harder to measure.  And there are big, established players who have the infrastructure & relationships that Google doesn't yet.  Plus, Microsoft has had MSNBC for years, and it doesn't seem to have helped them in TV advertising.",1227401634

This suggests two obvious possibilities. One is that chimerism may be involved. However, our data were obtained in the fall, and so we offer an alternative conjecture: that the bright coloration displayed by females may be a seasonal phenomenon, with their hair turning brown in the colder months and then lighter with the return of warm weather...<p>lol",1227401038

If subscribers are not reading the magazine that is a pretty bad sign so why should we be surprised about all of the ads.

I hate dups.<p>2. All references and facts are properly attributed and cited. The moment I see ""scientists found that 30% of..."" I cancel my subscription without hesitation.<p>3. Non-factual pieces (opinions) are from well-known experts. At least there should be a credibility trail behind those people.<p>4. Content is peer reviewed.

It could probably be left up to the child to decide what to make, and you just need to provide them with a theme eg. animals in the jungle or something. Give them 2-3 hours in a classroom to complete the task and then collect up the pieces for assessment.<p>The art projects could be used in conjunction with the test scores as another data point on which to base your decision.

373312,comment,373060,373060,0,0,zmimon,,,"I remember reading a similar article about the airline industry.<p>Despite great improvements in technology, fleet size and a greater diversity of airlines delays just get more frequent and more severe.  Why?   Because there is no longer any leeway in the system for error.   Each flight is turned around and sent out in such minimal time that if it is late for any reason the problem cascades on to the next flight.  And the whole system is so well coordinated that there is never any airplane just sitting around to make up for a problem.  So the whole system, though more efficient is more fragile.  And ironically, being more fragile, actually ends up making it <i>less</i> efficient.<p>Of course, as an engineer I simply say that you need to make the robustness part of your design goals to begin with and then design the system to meet that while being maximally efficient.",1227398761

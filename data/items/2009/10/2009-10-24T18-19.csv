no chance against a ""tricky"" problem without prior acquaintance with ""tricky""
sort of shortcut principle. I was always too slow and never grokked or scored
this sort of mathematics. I barely found anything profound or beautiful in Gardner's
SciAm columns. They were scary like black magic more than they were interesting. My teachers all from this school just bashed me and didn't told
me there is richer structured, theoretical and constructive side to mathematics. The same
year I qualified to the International Physics Olympiad I got <i>non passing</i> grade
in mathematics, at which point I dropped out of HS, went to do what unexpectedly
turned out <i>mathematical</i> physics and now I'm for a degree in pure mathematics, several
tantalizing years later than if my teachers were not so enchanted by Gardner's

What technology do you use to discover them, while filtering out the rest?<p>I've been using Google Reader for a long time, and while theoretically it should save time by eliminating the need to visit each website individually, I noticed that opposite is sometimes true. The main issues I am struggling with are:<p>- with more feeds added to the reader, the noise is increased<p>- the very act of being subscribed to something can create a feeling of ""obligation"" to check and ""clear"" the feed.<p>- the technology fosters the attachment of ""checking what's new,"" in a similar way email does, and that wastes even more time.<p>Of course, all of those issues can be alleviated by proper feeds curating, unsubscribe mercilessly and insist on discipline to not check the feeds too often.<p>Anyway, I feel there is a time to discover/invent some new technology to deliver my daily reading to me, something which would avoid the need to subscribe to sources. Recently, for example, I discovered that when something truly interesting is published, it will usually appear on twitter, and also being retweeted several times. I've been quite successful to use twitter search to discover new stuff for the keywords I am interested about, and the services like Tweetmeme are promising, too. But I didn't found yet some service which I can truly replace Google Reader with. Maybe that's also a good startup idea. What's your experience?",1256408725

That's how I understand it, anyway. So yes, I've been using Chromium the whole time.<p>I think it is worth it. It performs much, much better than even the nightly builds of Firefox. The interface is also exceedingly faster than Firefox's interface (moving tabs around, etc.), and this makes it much more pleasant to use.<p>I switched because Firefox was crashing incessantly because Arch linked it against an incompatible (newer) version of SQLite. When Chromium crashes, just the tab goes down. This is so nice.<p>I haven't experienced much crashing though. The only problems I've had were a one-time bug that snuck into the build where it wouldn't special-case your keystrokes in a text box so it would read out shortcuts while you were typing (meaning backspace made the page go back) but this is expected and it was fixed in the next build (which I downloaded immediately, naturally) and problems with Flash.<p>In the build I'm using now, Flash behavior is erratic; sometimes the buttons will work on YouTube and sometimes they won't. Zoomify's buttons never seem to work. Also, occasionally a video will lose sync with its audio and start playing about five seconds before the audio kicks in. As such, if I want to watch something on YouTube, I often find myself using Firefox to do so. If you're a big YouTube or Flash user you might be too annoyed at this to switch.

All of the team members have various levels of Linux expertise; some use it as needed for their job, others use Linux as their OS of choice. I think everyone will agree that as you continue to learn Linux, you learn a lot of tricks that make your life a lot easier (obscure commands, command options, various piped combinations, etc). I think we all have a lot we could learn from each other.<p>The local LUG on campus has sessions like this, but they usually end up being half hour discussions about ls switches. This is a huge waste of time... What's a good way to cover a lot of material quickly? Go around to each team member and ask ""what's the most useful command you've learned in the past year""? Have a few self-proclaimed Linux gurus prepare material beforehand to teach?<p>I'm open to suggestions. What have ya'll done?",1234465095

Lucene (and Solr, a search server that uses Lucene) can handle these two dimensions by ordering the analysis of indexed text and query terms appropriately - perform synonym expansion first, then apply stemming. The default scoring algorithm works well in a lot of cases, and Lucene/Solr's architecture allows plugging in a custom scoring implementation to boost individual keywords. Misspellings and wildcard handling is also available out of the box, and you can override most of the functionality easily. Reddit, Netflix, CNET, Digg etc. have all deployed Solr/Lucene on their public sites (<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers</a>).",1234462220

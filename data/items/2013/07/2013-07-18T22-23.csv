6067112,comment,6066245,6066812,4,0,kcg,,,"Even as a credit analyst, I agree that you can&#x27;t really feel sorry for the bondholders here. If you want to lend in any market, you need to assume the risk that the debtor goes bankrupt. Pensioners are a different story though.<p>However it&#x27;s absolutely not true that &quot;a lot of money in the US is being lent with the assumption that creditors will always be bailed out by the state or federal government&quot;, at least not a large amount relative to the total bond market size. Rates are low now, yes, but that&#x27;s because the Treasury rates are so low, not because of some implicit government backing of credit that is making assets less risky. In fact, spreads (bond yield - treasury yield) are near historical norms.",1374188393

The Bay Area is definitely one of the most expensive places to have a business which is especially tricky when you don&#x27;t have revenue like most startups. For example, rent for housing has increased dramatically over the last 5 years to point where people with decent jobs need housing assistance. As a business, you need to raise salaries so your employees can keep their standard of living. And employee salaries are the largest expense for software companies.<p>What I think keeps it going is the fact that a lot of rich people live there now and are willing to invest in companies. That investment allows the company to pay its bills while it is building its product. However even with investment, the money still goes quicker than if you were somewhere else. In essence, it looks like an angel investment bubble to me. The question is, will the bubble burst and when?",1374188181

IIRC, there was a study dating from the 60s that showed that when a neighborhood reached somewhere around 10-15% black, white people started moving out. This was taken advantage of by real estate investors, who would move a few middle-class black families onto a block (possibly taking a loss, because completely white neighborhoods aren&#x27;t attractive to most black families), starting a process of buying at a discount the houses of the white families who were desperate to leave, and then reselling to middle-class black families who often had higher incomes than the white families they were replacing. In this way, the replacement of white families by black families would snowball.<p>Of course, the appeal of those neighborhoods to middle-class black people would also drop, because as the whites left, the neighborhood lost its luster as a symbol of achieving the middle-class for black people. Prices start to drop to the level where less than middle class people can move in (to what would still be an aspirational neighborhood to black people who weren&#x27;t in the middle class.)<p>Then the city starts to withdraw services (the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s city), and, as in Chicago for example, builds highways and other developments as firebreaks to stop the expansion of these new black neighborhoods. Eventually many sections start to go into serious decline, and middle-class black people either leave, or manage to form exclusive enclaves within them.<p>tl;dr Humboldt Park and North Lawndale didn&#x27;t originally have high crime and bad schools, that was a process that was begun by white flight.<p>I always like to cite the example of the neighborhood I grew up in in Chicago: Avalon Park, where &quot;the average educational level increased, while the poverty rate decreased from 6.1% to 5.1% between 1960 and 1970.&quot;[1] The fact that black people were an improvement to the neighborhood didn&#x27;t slow white flight down a whit - we moved there in 1978, when I was 2, and when I entered school at 5 there was a <i>single</i> white person that attended Avalon Park Elementary School. His name was Patrick, and his stepfather was black. I only ever saw one white person in that neighborhood who wasn&#x27;t a teacher at that school. It was a windy day, and she was walking in front of Sears on 79th, trying to keep her scarf from blowing away. It was 1989.<p>If you care, I&#x27;ll find the reference at some point - but I couldn&#x27;t find it online, and most of my books are packed away in a fashion where it would take me at least an hour to find anything specific. If this year is like last year, I&#x27;ll find cause to wade into the stacks two or three times and I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Park,_Chicago"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Park,_Chicago</a>",1374186719

Not at all! That&#x27;s going to stay, that&#x27;s not even mentioned anywhere in this discussion.

No one, certainly not in that thread, wants to remove the syslog compatibility.<p>The discussion is just about _not_ installing a syslog daemon by default. It&#x27;s still supported, the compatibility (from systemd/journald) is there and going to stay. You just don&#x27;t run a syslog daemon without installing it explicitly.<p>3) The trend, what you perceive about the slippery slope of things<p>This is hard to argue about. There are no hard facts to prove/reject. You don&#x27;t seem to like a number of recent changes in the linux ecosystem. That&#x27;s - okay. Natural.

These are ambition and avaricethe love of power and the love of money. Separately, each of these has great force in prompting men to action; but, when united in view of the same object, they have, in many minds, the most violent effects. Place before the eyes of such men a post of honor, that shall, at the same time, be a place of profit, and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it. The vast number of such places it is that renders the British government so tempestuous. The struggles for them are the true source of all those factions which are perpetually dividing the nation, distracting its councils, hurrying it sometimes into fruitless and mischievous wars, and often compelling a submission to dishonorable terms of peace.<p>And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable preeminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention, the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of characters? It will not be the wise and moderate, the lovers of peace and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in their selfish pursuits. These will thrust themselves into your government and be your rulers. And these, too, will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their situation, for their vanquished competitors, of the same spirit, and from the same motives, will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their administration, thwart their measures, and render them odious to the people.&quot;",1374186651

(Federal trials and the trials in many states are NOT televised, as a default, but they are public except in very extraordinary circumstances. I have walked into trials in various places just because I can, as a member of the general public.)<p>In general, as I have said in other recent comments here on Hacker News, I can be appalled by several of the recent allegations about NSA activity without applauding Snowden&#x27;s actions. I took my wife and my two younger children along with a home-made protest sign (&quot;We support the Bill of Rights&quot;) to the lightly attended Restore the Fourth protest in Minneapolis. I did that openly and in full view of law enforcement authorities and news cameras because freedom is precious to me, and I don&#x27;t think my freedom should be abused on any rationale, even the rationale of fighting terrorist networks. That said, I find that whenever I get out of the Hacker News hivemind, and deal with any of my friends from around the world who have actually lived and worked in multiple countries, and especially those friends who have children of their whose futures the friends are working for, there is remarkably little regard of Snowden as a hero or a freedom-fighter. It&#x27;s not clear that he really has the technical chops to make a &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; work as he intends against all possible attack surfaces, and it&#x27;s not clear that all of his allegations about United States government activities are factually true, and it&#x27;s especially clear already that Snowden&#x27;s recent statements, with the ghost-writing help of Wikileaks, represent a badly unbalanced view of which countries in the world are the greatest enemies of human freedom, which is a cause I cherish all over the world.",1374186640

The owners of those buildings are Prop. 13&#x27;ed with a 30yr old assessment and are doing just fine.   Opening a new unit means they can collect more rent at todays market rates.  Its a silly story promoted by landlords that would like to make more money during the booms.  Of course, its also those very rent control laws that protect landlords during the busts (2002, 2009, etc).<p>Sorry to say this, but rent will come down when companies in SF start running out of their free, investor money and have to turn a profit or sell themselves.  More people will lose their jobs, won&#x27;t be able to afford living in the city proper and people will move away.

In 1940, Detroit had a 90% white population and was the highest standard of living city in America. During the course of WWII, 350,000 blacks moved into Detroit. In 1943, the Detroit Race Riot caused by tensions between whites and blacks resulted in 43 dead, 433 wounded. In 1967 it happened again, this time 43 dead, 1189 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed. President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in the Army to quell it. In 2010, the demographics are 10% white and 82% black, and Detroit is a bankrupt wasteland.<p>Deindustrialization happened in other cities such as Pittsburgh - but they&#x27;ve recovered by transitioning into technology/medicine industries and the like.

6066923,comment,6066461,6066461,15,0,bobwaycott,,,"From the source, Davies&#x27; argument (for those who don&#x27;t want to register for <i>Physics World</i>):<p>Cancers prevalence among multi-cellular organisms indicates it is &quot;deeply embedded in the logic of life&quot;. It is found among mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and other organisms. The human genome is pre-loaded with a &quot;cancer sub-routine&quot; that is triggered by various factors. Once triggered, most cancers follow a similar pattern: reproduce uncontrollably in a specific organ, then spread throughout the host, invading and colonizing other organs and parts of the bodies with the help of tumors.<p>> <i>The overall impression is of a carefully orchestrated and pre-programmed strategy--its aim to multiply cancer cells and colonize new sites--which is unleashed when neoplastic cells somehow evade the normal regulatory mechanisms of the organism and embark on their own agenda.</i><p>Seeing a &quot;highly organized and efficient behaviour in biology&quot; leads Davies and Lineweaver to suspect evolutionary mechanisms at play. Davies finds that orthodox explanations describing cancer as random genetic mutations starting from scratch leave too many unanswered questions--such as why they are fitter than the existing healthy cells in a body, why such random mutation provides &quot;a whole series of mutually supportive survival traits ... in a period of just years of months&quot;, why dormant cancer returns in the same organ after a primary tumor is removed, or &quot;why cancer cells deliberately transplanted into certain tissues, or cancer nuclei into healthy cells, often results in normal behaviour&quot;, while the reverse process results in cancerous cells.<p>Thus, from a physics perspective, &quot;there are clues pointing to cancer as a phenomenon influenced by forces and fields--not one that is purely ruled by genetic instruction.&quot; Sadly, the article never dives into more on this physics perspective and what kinds of forces and fields may be at play, instead turning to evolutionary biological arguments from embryonic development applied to cancer development.<p>> <i>Cells are usually regulated by mechanisms that instruct them when to multiply and when to die. What we believe is that when these mechanisms malfunction, the cells revert to the default option, a genetic subroutine programmed into their ancestors long ago, of behaving in a selfish way.</i><p>> <i>Lineweaver and I suggest that genes that are active in early-stage embryogenesis and silenced thereafter  which, by our hypothesis, are generally the ancient and highly conserved genes  may be inappropriately reactivated in the adult form as a result of some sort of insult or damage. This trigger serves to kick-start the cascade of maladaptation events we identify as cancer. So the &quot;cancer subroutine&quot; is really just a re-run of an embryonic developmental program. We envisage a collection of ancient conserved genes driving the cancer phenotype, in which the metastatic mobility of cancer cells and the invasion and colonization of other organs merely reflects the dynamically changing nature of embryonic cells and their ability to transform into different types of tissues.</i><p>> <i>The big picture is that we attribute cancer&#x27;s survival traits to deep evolution on a billion-year scale, rather than orthodox explanations that point to evolution from scratch with each case of the disease. In our theory, the latter remains true, but is a small perturbation.</i><p>The ASU article covers much of the rest of the original article by Davies. ASU just left out much of the lead-up to how they arrived at their conclusions.<p><i>Physics World</i> also has a lot more coverage in the current issue, entitled &quot;Physics of Cancer&quot;.

The developer eats the cost on that for a while, but then the next recession hits, people lose their jobs, banks foreclose on the properties, and that starts the tumble in prices.  That&#x27;s how it worked in 2009 - rents dropped significantly in the Bay Area as employment numbers tumbled and people moved in with roommates.  It does depend on their being a recession before demand catches up with supply...if there isn&#x27;t, prices just don&#x27;t increase as fast in the meantime.",1374185121

This new medium grid size thing is a great upgrade.<p>What I never liked about the Bootstrap/Foundation CSS frameworks was having to mark up my HTML with those damn &quot;small-4 large-8 columns&quot; attributes.  It felt to me like that purely-visual stuff should be kept in the CSS, not the HTML.<p>So I was thrilled when I found I didn&#x27;t have to put any of that in the HTML - that it could all go in the SCSS, which then parses/compiles it into the final public CSS.<p>So you can just have:<p><pre><code>  <div id=&quot;sidebar&quot;>blah</div>
  <div id=&quot;article&quot;>blah</div>
</code></pre>
... then in your SCSS file, do this:<p><pre><code>  div#sidebar {
    @extend .columns;
    @extend .small-3;
  }
  div#article {
    @extend .columns;
    @extend .small-9;
  }
</code></pre>
... and that&#x27;s it!  It adds those selectors to the final CSS file and your semantic HTML will have the layout/look you want.<p>To me, that changed everything, and I&#x27;ve been a fan since.<p>This has been covered other places, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been covered enough, and I think it was another HN commenter that turned me onto it like this, so just paying it forward in case someone else didn&#x27;t know yet.",1374185078

At first it was a trivial repository merge, just something to make the developers more comfortable, no impact to anyone else.  Now building udev without systemd is unsupported, and some cleanupsare made to tie udev to systemd and kmod.  This doesn&#x27;t benefit systemd but it hurts anyone who uses an alternative.<p>The same kind of breakage of alternatives is pushed on gnome via logind, and the kernel via cgroups.

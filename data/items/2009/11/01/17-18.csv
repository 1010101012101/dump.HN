915321,comment,915212,915212,0,0,HenryR,,,"I don't agree with all his conclusions. In particular, it seems as though he is saying 'eventual consistency is no practical good' and then beating Dynamo for a few paragraphs with the same stick.<p>The most often quoted example of Dynamo's use is the shopping cart application on every Amazon page. In the worst case, your shopping cart will mysteriously empty itself. This is a huge pain, and a potential loss for Amazon, but it's not catastrophic in the way that is implied here. Indeed, assuming the liveness of a quorum, the application will read back all conflicting entries for the shopping cart (those that aren't ordered under their vector clock timestamps) and the onus is on it to merge the conflicts. Of course, the shopping cart will take the union of all updates to ensure that nothing is dropped (and therefore some delete operations may be lost).<p>The key point is that some applications can do without observing a linearisable history, and the interest of this paper is that it explores the design space if you drop that requirement.<p>I don't understand the post's points about CAP; all three requirements are in tension. Dynamo is unusual in that it is live in the case of a network partition while still maintaining its consistency guarantees.<p>Similarly - those systems that use chain-replication asynchronously like he describes can still suffer from the same read-old-value-after-it-was-written consistency issue, if the reader jumps between two replicas for consecutive reads. Avoiding that can require synchronous coordination of updates (a la Paxos, e.g.) which is, I think, what the paper is driving at. Otherwise, there are still failure modes which, in order to patch up, require stronger guarantees about liveness of quorums than Dynamo needs.<p>I understand that Dynamo is no longer used internally at Amazon at scale, so maybe some of the practical points this post makes about the realities of central coordination held water for real deployments. Still, I don't buy the reaction that prioritising availability uber alles and designing a system that does not behave exactly like a strongly-consistent key-value store immediately invalidates it for workloads that have high availability requirements and lower consistency needs.",1257098357

I've had my primary email address sitting out on my contact page for years and have never spent a significant amount of time dealing with spam.

915305,comment,913931,915146,0,0,chrischen,,,"> The current law on free speech in the United States is precisely designed to allow (and, indeed, encourage) open and continual refutation of mistaken ideas on public policy. That is the whole point of the American experiment in free speech.<p>You're right. And the whole point of not punishing for their opinion is so that you can criticize them openly. Imagine if we didn't let the racists make their argument, then we <i>can not refute them by reason</i> because there would be nothing to refute. So to let them express their opinions, then everyone else can openly see how ludicrous they are, rather than trying to hide them and their so obviously wrong ways.<p>The parenting advice is something I picked up from various sources. And it's based on the idea that we should constructively criticize, and not scold. I'm sure you've heard the advice to show young children the right way, rather than to tell them explicitly that they are wrong. I have a very young sister that was born when I was 16 (I think) and this is why I even listen to such advice.<p>I'm not a parent, but I was a child, as has everyone. And being a parent does not necessarily legitimize any specific parenting tactic one has, especially with regard to long term effects.<p>So the example I gave about showing kids the correct way to do things instead of scolding or telling them they are wrong  is probably a better example. I'm not exactly sure where I saw the advice for ignoring annoying behavior to stop it, but let's forget that example.<p>But this example is more analogous to our current argument. Instead of telling people they are wrong, it's simply better to show them, and others, the better way. The better way should be enough convincing and any need to artificially make it better (by denouncement) would be prone to human error. But to have to <i>show</i> someone the <i>better</i> way would require cooperation by reality if you know what I mean. And such cooperation by reality would only happen if your proposed idea, opinion, or whatever is <i>truly</i> better.<p>In essence, I'm proposing that we humans do the upvote, because nothing bad comes out of doing that, and let reality do the down voting.<p>So by only allowing up vote we better prevent people from artificially marginalizing an idea.",1257097821

915303,comment,914926,915178,0,0,eserorg,,,"I can speak to the value of multivariate optimization in the oil and gas business.<p>Specifically, the U.S. onshore natural gas business is currently focused on what are called shale gas ""resource plays"". These are large contiguous blocks of acreage -- hundreds of thousands of acres -- over which thousands of wells are drilled one-after-another, in a manufacturing process. What makes this possible is a large, contiguous, underlying resource of natural gas reserves, trapped in tight rocks.<p>The key to profitably exploiting these resource plays is finding the right ""formula"" that can be repetitively applied to drilling and completing each well. There is no time to individually sit down and engineer each well. All you can do is analyze the data after the fact.<p>The profitability of each gas well is influenced by hundreds of variables. For instance, you have to ""fracture stimulate"" a gas well using a variable combination of hundreds of chemicals, each in a varying volume, with a variable pressure, to a variable depth. The well itself may have a variable number of frac stages, with a variable number of horizontal lateral wells connecting it to the reservoir, with a variable length for each lateral.<p>The question you have to answer is: given thousands of data points over thousands of individual wells, what is the most profitable ""formula"" for drilling a well in a particular resource play? Profitability is defined as the present value of the discounted future cash flow of the well using a discount rate of 10% -- you'll hear people talk about ""the PV10"". You know how each well has performed after it was drilled, you know what its profitability was, and you know what formula was applied to drill and to complete it. And you have this data for hundreds of wells -- each using a different combination of variables. And there's new data added every day.<p>There is a _lot_ of money riding on the right answer to this question.<p>There is a _massive_ amount of data in the oil and gas business. And every year there are entirely new classes of data being generated. 2D seismic, then 3D seismic, then microseismic, completion data, well logs, magnetic, gravity, surface linears, etc...<p>It's not surprising that one of the largest customers to the supercomputing industry -- after defense -- is the oil and gas business.<p>One trick here is that this data is usually locked up inside proprietary databases shared amongst companies in different industry consortia. So, you really have to be a player in the business to have access to the data -- that doesn't mean that you have any clue how to analyze it, however.<p>And there are big QA problems with this data, too. So, you have to deal with that as well.",1257097603

Period.  You cannot trust every server, protection mechanism and employee in between.

If you've made your key recipients sign something legally binding, and retained proof that no one else could have received keys from you, then at least you'd know who to sue for violating your trust.<p>Ideally, the mechanism for transferring the keys doesn't use a network either, e.g. physically hand something to your intended audience that will let them decrypt whatever you do send.  The data should also have a built-in ""time bomb"" that makes it impossible to decrypt anything after some specified period of time (for peace of mind).

That's sort of like finding someone who has a vertical leap 8 inches greater than Michael Jordan and saying ""I don't doubt he has some athleticism..."" Maybe you don't think transcendent jumping ability necessarily makes you a good basketball player, but you'd sure give someone with that trait a harder look. In a similar vein, you may not think an IQ score is the final word in apprehending great truths, but you should certainly take a little extra care, I'd think.<p>At least, when I encounter analysis by someone who is significantly smarter than I am, and I don't fully understand their claims, my first impulse isn't to be dismissive or make ill-defined, hand-wavy criticisms.",1257096517

Growing up, I knew I had a high IQ score (my parents actually lowballed in hinting what my IQ score was, but I found out the actual score in adult life from my schoolteacher who referred me for testing), and I read in a story by Philip K. Dick that high-IQ people feel social distance from most classmates, which became a self-fulfilling prophecy for me. But later in life I lived in east Asia as a student of the Chinese language, and I discovered that Confucian philosophers expected smart people to use their smarts to get along with everyone, summed up in the saying of Confucius, ""三人行，必有我师焉"" ""Wherever there are three persons walking, my teacher is surely among them."" I learned from my experience overseas that I could appreciate other people for their abilities, and expect to learn from most people of my acquaintance, whatever their IQ scores. Since then, I have been more socially comfortable with a wider variety of people, and have felt less isolated. I still devote a lot of my free time to activism on behalf of gifted learners, which provides me with a social circle of people who understand my personal background.",1257096415

I trained them face to face. No effect.<p>I later discovered that they copy/pasted the documents from MS Word. The copied text carried over Word's formatting, and because it didn't look like in Word, they tried to make it look better by visual editing, or by totally ignoring the results.<p>One day I deactivated the WYSIWYG editor, telling them that they should learn HTML. Enough to say that they were so upset that I'm now no longer helping them with anything.<p>I'm not even talking about using technology here. I'm talking about basic skills you need when writing a clear essay ... kids are supposed to learn this stuff in school.<p>This is not necessarily about people being trained by us to be ignorant.

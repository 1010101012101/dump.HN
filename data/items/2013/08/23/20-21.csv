If they do not, they cannot.</i> Except people don&#x27;t drink 80C coffie so the absolute time it takes to reach 30C is less important than how long it spends in the drinkable range.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know what wax there using or how much, but Paraffin wax for example has about 1/2 the heat of fusion of water.  So it would store enough energy to keep ~35 times as much water at a constant temperature rather than failing one degree c at which point the was would freeze and provide negligible benifit.  On the other hand if the wax water ratio was 1:5 then the temperature would stabilize though 7 degrees worth of cooling when the coffie was 80C and then 7C of warming when the coffie was 37C which would be noticeable. Granted, 37C is a little to cold for coffie, other waxes have a higher melting point.<p>PS: I still don&#x27;t think this would be all that useful in practice.

6266183,comment,6264657,6265364,11,0,leifaffles,,,"I think there is some broad confusion over &quot;flow-based programming&quot; implying &quot;non-programmers using a graph editor to connect things&quot;. So I&#x27;m going to ignore that completely in favor of talking about flow-based programming for programmers.<p>Here&#x27;s an example I have experience with:<p>The GRL research language [1] is a dataflow language for behavior-based robotics. It&#x27;s a real programming language that batch compiles down to C code that runs in O(1) time and space (it&#x27;s not Turing complete). It escapes from the &quot;spaghetti code&quot; problem you mention by providing an abstraction of a procedure as a compile-time rewrite rule that transforms the dataflow graph (for Lisp hackers, every procedure is basically a macro that can be passed around by value at compile-time).<p>(FWIW, graphical editors can actually be a useful and pleasant way to construct throwaway flow graphs, but aren&#x27;t particularly useful for developing new abstractions (i.e. dataflow procedures or data types). They run into the spaghetti code problem you mention, by which the only way to reuse a chunk of functionality is copy-paste)<p>The system has been used for things like programming actual robots, Half Life bots [2], and motor control for interactive game-like thingies [3]. What it&#x27;s really great at is managing stateful information over time. Things like moving averages, low pass filters, and other types of state machines (flip-flops, &quot;just true&quot; constructs, etc) all become first-class values in your programming language.<p>So how could this be used in a more flexible environment that isn&#x27;t ideological about dataflow programming? While dataflow graphs may be limited in their expressiveness, we can use them to encapsulate many types of state machines, particularly those that change over time or in response to stimulus. Under this model, every self-contained flow graph becomes a thunk whose input values are determined by evaluating arbitrary expressions in the host language (and can be dynamically instantiated). For implementations of this technique, see [3]. Finally, [4] is an implementation of the stateful time-based dataflow constructs I wrote for a game in C#, which power things like motor behaviors, input processing, collision avoidance, animations, and interpolations. As a bonus, you can add events on top of these for a simple implementation of functional reactive programming.<p>So do you want to build a web app in a dataflow language? Maybe not. Do you want flow-based constructs in your programming language? Depending on what you&#x27;re building, the answer could range of &quot;Not really&quot; to &quot;I can&#x27;t live without them.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ian/grl-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ian/grl-paper.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~gdunham/flexbot/manual/grl_for_flexbot.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~gdunham/flexbot/manual/grl_f...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE11/paper/view/4081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE11/paper/view/4...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/leifaffles/chad/src/d6a13c2315cce41dba1b4572749bd3969c821286/ChadEngine/Signals/Library/Stateful.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/leifaffles/chad/src/d6a13c2315cce41dba...</a>",1377291095

Simple.  Nothing about legal\n&quot;complexity&quot; can argue against this.<p>Second, for the Internet, lawyers should mostly\njust f&#x27;get about it.  Just ignore it.  Don&#x27;t\nmake or prosecute laws about it.  Don&#x27;t have\ncivil suits about it.  F&#x27;get about computer\nindustry patents.  Just go do something else.\nIn particular, again, no problems with\nlegal &quot;complexity&quot;.<p>For &quot;private property&quot; and what&#x27;s on Web sites,\njust f&#x27;get about it.  It&#x27;s simple, dirt simple:<p>(A) The Internet is new and different and nothing\nlike much of anything before.  It&#x27;s not like\na house, storefront, bookstore, front yard,\nnewspaper, etc., and trying to force the Internet\nonto some such Procrustean bed is just destructive\nnonsense.<p>(B) If an owner of a Web site has some\ndata they don&#x27;t want spread around, then they should\nnot put it on their Web site.  Just don&#x27;t do it.<p>If they do, then their ability to &#x27;protect&#x27; their\ndata is zip, zilch, and zero.  Both technically,\nfor reasons simple to deep and profound,\nand legally, in practice, they can&#x27;t protect such\ndata and likely never will be able to.  So,\ndon&#x27;t put the data out there.  If they do,\nthen f&#x27;get about the lawyers and protecting that\ndata.<p>Sorry &#x27;bout that, but copyright\nlaws were not designed for the Internet and\ndigital data.<p>A Web site owner \ncan try to be like the MPAA\nand RIAA and try to hold on to the past, but, \nfor many reasons lawyers can&#x27;t effectively\nstop, it\nwon&#x27;t work.

And we don&#x27;t need SOPA \nor PIPA.<p>Sure, a citizen should make his\nviews known to Congress.

I did not feel like that was called for.<p>I will suggest that at some point, if you live long enough, you will cross paths with someone you knew as a young person, someone you liked and respected, who was either charged with robbery or who was earning money in a way that you don&#x27;t condone. I would ask that you judge carefully at that point. It happened to me when I drove by a friend from high school who was in the median strip asking stopped traffic for money.<p>Living in the world requires things, supplies, water, food, housing. Unless you can make those things on your own, you&#x27;re stuck trading money for them. And to trade money, you have to get money. The longer you don&#x27;t have enough money the lower and lower your standards tend to go. Some folks sadly decide to simply stop trying and check out of the system permanently. Life is real.<p>So when you see a site like SourceForge, you might ask what happened, or perhaps what changed, but it doesn&#x27;t get you any points for judging them harshly for trying to survive. GitHub is the new hawtness and I love what those folks are doing, but I&#x27;ve not seen the press release that says they are operationally profitable yet, or even cash flow positive. That will change, and when it changes you may see them having to push &quot;partner&quot; software your way, they may have some other plan by then, or they may just sort of evaporate in some giant acqui-hire [1].<p>[1] Personally I think that Github being bought by, or displaced by, an infrastructure service play like Amazon&#x27;s AWS is the most likely outcome.",1377290288

When the purchase price drops below some point, it becomes cheaper to buy and own than to rent and so the economics of trying to lend or rent them just don&#x27;t work out.<p>There is also a middle ground. For example, many people choose to rent their washer and dryer or living room furniture while most people purchase it. But for an item like a $20 drill, I don&#x27;t think there is a point at which the small amount of room it takes up outweighs the cost and inconvenience of having somebody come and create the holes for you. Which goes back to my original point- this logic is backwards-looking. There may have been some time in the past when you simply didn&#x27;t have a tool to make holes so you would have to hire somebody. But because people&#x27;s time is expensive (as well as the tools) the invention of a battery-operated drill would be viewed as a huge leap in convenience.

And whether Github will keep Releases/downloads around at all since they&#x27;ve only been around for a month and were unceremoniously killed off just 8 months prior.<p>SourceForge is a known quantity with download mirrors all over the world that you can push 10s of TBs per month through for free as long as you&#x27;re a fully open source project.  Github, on the other hand, is an unknown quantity with respect to big downloads.",1377289243

Constructive proofs translate into working programs.<p>It also ties into philosophy. I am a skeptic, so when someone tells me either A or not A must be true even if we can never know which one, I ask for proof or justification of that fact.

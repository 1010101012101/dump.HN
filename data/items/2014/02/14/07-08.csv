7237477,comment,7233730,7235756,4,0,dobbsbob,,,"It&#x27;s a common police tactic to arrest somebody Friday night on bogus charges so they have to sit in prison all weekend to see a judge on Monday. Cops here would round up anybody unsightly like the homeless,  protesters or people they thought would protest before some big weekend or Friday night event, just to keep them off the streets until it was over. They did this until false arrest laws came in where you could sue the police but before that there were dragnets every weekend.<p>Now cops just hand out tickets for every petty violation they can to the homeless since they know they can&#x27;t pay, and ticket protesters for jaywalking or some other BS, and when a major media covered event comes through they now have a legit reason to round them all up.<p>Cops can also detain you longer, like this guy who was kept 24hrs in a psych eval, even though he had already spent hours in jail.",1392364786

This means that when the Federation media covers the battle of Wolf 359 (11k dead, worst military disaster in centuries) it probably caused a brief flurry of controversy leavened with &quot;Well at least they died doing what they loved: live-action role playing&quot; and then it promptly went back to more interesting topics like which pop stars had just broken up.<p>It naturally follows that Earth was never in serious danger at any point because, hah, are you insane?  We just didn&#x27;t hit the Borg cube with the Lance of Judgement and instakill it from half a galaxy away because that would have been a terrible affront to Picard&#x27;s character arc, and we really care about that sort of thing.  Look at our Prime Directive: we&#x27;d rather genocide an entire race than interfere too much in the story.  (Heh, psych, we&#x27;re not total psychos.  The Prime Directive strikes a few chords with our culture, because it needs to sound plausible to Starfleet officers, but isn&#x27;t our main guiding principle any more than the US is based on not violating a shot clock.  The Prime Directive is actually just there to provide interesting moral situations for Star Trek officers.  We wargamed out several hundred generations of officers on a Holodeck simulation and they end up tremendously unfulfilled when doing the right thing is obvious, possible, and successful, like it always is in real life in the Federation.)",1392364504

7237455,comment,7233730,7237028,39,0,downandout,,,"In my experience there aren&#x27;t many cases against government entities that attorneys will take on contingency.  A friend of mine was held for nearly 2 years without bail because he was deemed a flight risk (the white collar charges he faced were eventually dropped).  He spent most of that time experiencing violent and painful vomiting attacks.  He was told he had an ulcer and was given ulcer medication that had no effect on the attacks.<p>Upon his release, he immediately went to an ER where he was told he had developed gallstones and that it had gone on so long that it was affecting his other organs.  His pancreas was on the verge of shutting down.  He was told that it was good that he came in when he did, as he would have been dead in another month or so.  It was eventually revealed that the gallstones diagnosis had been made by the jail doctor approximately 16 months before his release, and that he had recommended a surgery be scheduled.  That never happened and he was never told about the diagnosis.  At one point during his incarceration, his attorney requested bail based on the jail&#x27;s inability to properly diagnose/treat the problem.  The prosecutor mocked the request in open court, saying he &quot;had stomach pains sometimes too&quot; and the judge denied the renewed bail request because jail staffers insisted that they were doing everything medically reasonable.<p>I helped him contact probably 50 attorneys.  Not a single one would take the case on contingency, mainly because there was no permanent injury or death that had occurred.  The government got away with nearly killing my friend while he was being held without bond on charges that were ultimately dismissed.",1392364374

7237452,comment,7234010,7237029,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> That said, it is decidedly not what we have now.<p>Totally agreed.<p>> ...personally believe that it&#x27;s not in the interest of justice that they don&#x27;t prosecute, but because the wrong prosecution could lead to the massive outflux of power from the federal government if the Interstate Commerce Clause is returned to its originalist meaning.<p>It&#x27;s more than that.  Before the two states fully legalized the basic status quo was that the average state prosecuted more marijuana possession crimes than the Feds did.  The Feds are in an awkward position of really wanting to do something but simply being in no position, practically speaking, to fill the hole in power these two states left.  They keep drafting policies that allow them to prosecute whoever they want while claiming to respect the state.  But the problem is that they can&#x27;t do enough to make a difference.  To an extent there might be a backlash it would come at effectively no gains for their position.<p>BTW, I am a Distributist, which bears some surface similarity to some parts of Libertarianism (and I think the more moderate Libertarians end up reinventing a large chunk of Distributism in the quest for working solutions).<p>Distributism and Libertarianism have some important similarities regarding a desire for a weak state, with power held close to the people but they are very different in some basic ways.  For example, the definitions of things like freedom and self-ownership are so far apart they don&#x27;t really reconcile very well with Libertarian thought.<p>(Freedom may be thought of as the right to control how one works and thus a positive freedom, instead of freedom from restraint or even freedom of contract.  That also means that micromanagement is almost universally seen in Distributist circles as <i>evil</i> whether it is by a private or public sector authority.  Self-ownership:  we own our deeds and reputation and hence ourselves vs. a general principle of individual autonomy.)<p>The other likely area of disagreement is when it comes to encouraging widespread ownership of property.    Distributists see this as a legitimate role of government because property == power.  I haven&#x27;t yet seen a Libertarian espouse that such is a legitimate goal of government.",1392364248

It let us iterate rapidly and scaled reasonably well. Our mistake was when we decided to put off fixing MongoDB’s deployment, instead vertically scaling (...) By the time we had cycles to spend, it was too late to shard effectively It would have been terribly painful and unacceptably slowed our cluster for days.&quot;<p>It seems they weren&#x27;t sharding their data. The advantage of the popular NoSQL databases like MongoDB is that they allow easier horizontal scaling than general purpose RDMS (though this is debatable - Postgres and Oracle allow you to make the same trade offs as NoSQL databases, they just don&#x27;t force you to)<p>When you read the rest of the article, they explain that when they had to make a painful transition anyway, they chose Cassandra, to a different set of advantages and disadvantages that suited their needs.<p>MongoDB is still relevant because it is well supported. The product is well documented, excellent tooling is available, it is widely adopted, so that when you have a question, you can often google the answer.<p>It has an elegant query language; especially the built in aggregation framework is far more convenient than having to write map reduce functions for every query. It is easy to deploy and use. All these things make it a product that is pleasant to use from the point of view of a developer or DBA. I think you underestimate the importance of non-technical advantages and disadvantages<p>I am just not convinced it is the best database because I just don&#x27;t see a use case for a &#x27;general purpose&#x27; NoSQL database. For general purpose storage, RDMS like Postgres and Oracle are great. They support sharding if you really want it, and even allow indexing of unstructured data these days.

This isn&#x27;t restricted to just people, either, it&#x27;s been observed in monkeys (<a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0917_030917_monkeyfairness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0917_030917_...</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKhAd0Tyny0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKhAd0Tyny0</a> -- it&#x27;s a short video and pretty hilarious, worth a watch).<p>At the same time, capitalism has serious flaws, also exploited by human psychology. Capitalism rewards not just work and the investment of capital but also greed and cheating.<p>So, when looking for a new economic model, why not go back to psychology? Is it really true that <i>most</i> people don&#x27;t want to work? There are some people who are content to receive a small stipend and spend their lives jut getting by without doing very much, but does that describe enough people to cause the collapse of a strong welfare society?<p>I think we probably are headed towards a post-scarcity (or low-scarcity) economy.

7237354,comment,7233730,7235224,7,0,vacri,,,"Wasting time reminds me of a positive story about cops: At 3am, some guys thew a hammer through my driver-side window and tried to take my car to go street racing (it looked faster than it was...). The idiots jammed the handbrake on and couldn&#x27;t release it. The endless revving of the engine woke up my housemate, who scared them off, then called the cops, then woke me up.<p>I was annoyed. Great, now we have to wait an hour for the cops to show up, and they&#x27;re going to be pissed off that they had to leave the comfortable station to waste time dealing with something that they can&#x27;t do anything about. Broken sleep, broken window, and now I have to manage an interaction with grumpy police.<p>The cops that arrived showed empathy. Yes, they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it, but their underlying tone was &quot;this was a shitty thing to have happened&quot; rather than &quot;why the fuck are you wasting our time&quot;. I was so taken aback by the shift in tone that I actually said the line, corny as it is, &quot;I&#x27;ve lived here for 11 years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with the Fitzroy police&quot;<p>The cop searching with a torch behind my car doubled over in silent laughter while the one in front of me smirked &quot;Actually, we&#x27;re from Collingwood...&quot;",1392361440

I am not surprised that GCC managed to eliminate the pointless loop entirely in this situation. In fact I was happy that both Pelles C and LuaJIT did not realize that the whole loop was pointless and thus I did not have to come up with a more complex example.<p>The primary point of this was to show that JIT compilers can optimize away hash table access and dynamic typing in hot loops, not a code generation competition between LuaJIT and GCC.<p>I am a pretty big LuaJIT fanboy and not even I would claim that Lua compiled with LuaJIT can compete against C  compiled by current versions of GCC with all optimizations turned on, at least not in most real-world cases. However, it does get amazingly close, most of the time within an order of magnitude, which means that I personally do not need to use C anymore.",1392361385

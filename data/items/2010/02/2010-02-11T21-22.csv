One solution is to concentrate the use of named state in one part of the program and to avoid named state in the rest. The bulk of the program is a pure function without named state. The rest of the program is a state transformer: it calls the pure function to do the actual work. This concentrates the named state in a small part of the program.""</i><p>This very closely resembles the philosophy behind Clojure.",1265925577

It was new, foreign and none of my tools that I was used to worked. I couldnt find all instances of string 'XYZ' and replace it with 'ZYX' in the ways I was used to and it bothered me but if you give a system like smalltalk enough time, you will see the advantages.<p>I have a hard time now when I'm working in ruby, perl or any other language where I don't have a debugger that can halt at any point in running code so I can examine everything about it: all my data, code, everything. I can run snippets of code against that data to verify results and then update my code right then, hit proceed and my bug is fixed.  I never liked debuggers before smalltalk and now I know why, most debuggers are just too limited. I remember the glorious C days of finding the suspected cause of a bug and then recompling to test to make sure it was it. I remember the web app development days of logging and print statements.<p>What I have now when I do web development in Seaside is the ability to drop a breakpoint into any location in my code, get the debugger and quickly see, test and fix any issues I'm having. I love it and don't want to go back.<p>There are, however, tons of things I want to change about Smalltalk and the various communities that surround it, but for me, the core experience is second to none that I have ever experienced.",1265925407

1118854,comment,1117993,1117993,0,0,kiwidrew,,,"Unfortunately, there's a reason why banks and other financial institutions tend to batch transactions together and settle them overnight:  liquidity requirements.<p>Basically, the shorter the settlement period, the more cash the banks need to keep immediately accessible.  The increased liquidity requirement carries with it the opportunity cost of keeping that cash available at-hand instead of in more productive investments.  With end-of-day settlement, each bank only needs to transfer the _net_ amount (outgoing transfers minus incoming transfers), which is -- barring a really nasty run on one of the banks -- an order of magnitude smaller.  So there's a tradeoff between settlement speed and transaction cost.<p>But this doesn't prevent the bank from immediately notifying the recipient of the funds that a transfer has been made.  It's just that the funds aren't available for use until after settlement.<p>For some interesting details about the tradeoff between settlement delay and transaction costs, I found <a href=""http://ideas.repec.org/p/bca/bocawp/06-20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.repec.org/p/bca/bocawp/06-20.html</a> to be an interesting read.",1265924745

There really are some odd folks at any big geek convention.<p>While we were waiting for the next act, someone brought up the story of the shirtless dancing guy and I jokingly challenged my slightly drunk friend to be that guy. He said ""I can't dance."" I told him ""Dude, just do the Hokie Pokie.""<p>He started singing and dancing and we all backed up a few steps. He was joking, but he soldiered on to the second verse, and then the third. During the 3rd verse, we kinda felt bad for how ridiculous he looked and people were watching <i>us</i>. So I and a few of our circle started in. Then, a girl in a giant dragon costume ran over to join. As soon as the dragon girl showed up, everyone was watching. We started the song over, expanded the circle, and before you knew it, there was 3 more people running over. By the time we actually made it through the whole song without having to expand the circle, there was almost 40 people doing the Hokie Pokie!<p>The weird bit about this story, however, is that doing the Hokie Pokie in a circle limits how far you can grow. As the circle kept expanding, it became less and less space efficient. People were excluded simply because there wasn't space for them to join. At almost 40 people, the Hokie Pokie circle had effectively collapsed under its own size. Maybe next year we'll try a dance that scales better.",1265924154

[ugh. now the reply links are there, my bad?]<p>It's illegal to resell beef to consumers which wasn't slaughtered at a facility with a USDA inspector. If you buy the whole animal, like bmj does, then it can be slaughtered by anyone who knows what they're doing and packed (cut and wrapped) by any competent butcher. You then cannot resell that meat (and, in fact, all of the packaging should have not for retail stamps on it).<p>Now, personally, having actually toured a slaughterhouse (the one in Fresno, CA), I've got no problem with them. I definitely take issue with the ""enormous horrible disease-ridden"" characterization. Most of the food safety problems have been artifacts of the high volume hamburger production process. If you buy steaks, or even hamburgers made by butchers from whole cuts of meat, you should be in the clear.<p>I was merely trying to point out, somewhat obliquely, that unless you're slaughtering an animal you own and then buying all of the cut and wrapped meat, any beef you buy in the US was slaughtered at a huge slaughterhouse. That's just the reality of the situation, and it's a combination of regulations intended to keep you safe (having a USDA inspector on site is really, really expensive) and the continued consolidation of the packing industry (enabled by the government, NIMBY organizations, environmental groups, etc).<p>At the same time, as an Nth generation cattle rancher (where N > 4), I don't want to discourage anyone from buying locally raised beef. ;-)",1265923576

Until now most 3d projects have kept the stereoscopic distance fixed, which yields the feeling of watching the story take place on a stage in front of one and occasionally having one of the props or actors protrude outwards toward the audience.

If pure water was a non-renewable resource, the purity of the world's water supplies would not be capable of going up, only down; but water purity in the United States has increased since industries stopped dumping pollutants indiscriminately, and since the discontinuing of, for example, DDT use, so pure water is not a non-renewable resource.<p>Therefore, and continuing my point about uncultivated lands, unmanaged oceans, and starvation due to political and not economic problems, I do not see any reason to believe that we are at or close to the planet's carrying capacity.<p>Let me also add that oil is probably not biological in origin (otherwise, how could depleted oil reserves occasionally refill spontaneously?), and that it has no ecological role that I'm aware of to begin with, given that it's generally rather far underneath the biosphere.<p>And, if the Earth were already at or close to its carrying capacity, shouldn't we have begun to notice trouble with resource availability in situations other than terrible political regimes (and government-induced price bubbles like the reprehensible US maize-ethanol subsidy)?",1265922197

But what I can tell you, is that when I learned OOP - first in AS3, and then in PHP - I was able to pick up other languages MUCH quicker.<p>I'm not entirely certain, but I can't think of a single disadvantage to learning OOP. I'd actually be interested to know if there where some.<p>I'd also add.. Learning PHP as a first language slowed me down a bit when exploring other languages. PHP is very forgiving. If you're just learning to learn.. Maybe you should consider starting with a language that's much more strict; Python or Perl in my case. This way you focus on the concepts instead of the practices. PHP is one of those.. ""more than one way to skin a cat"" languages. Or at least more than most (from my experience).",1265922139

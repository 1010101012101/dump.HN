2082891,comment,2082505,2082859,0,0,rlpb,,,"According to the FSF, it is about freedom for users.<p>""Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it means that the program's users have the four essential freedoms:<p><pre><code>    * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
    * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.""</code></pre>",1294487745

2082888,comment,2080803,2080803,0,0,ncash,,,"It definitely depends on what your product is. Some customers will not be very forgiving while others will be relentless champions for you.<p>Our approach has been somewhat unique. Our MVP is mostly a throw-away version we got out into the world as fast as possible to test the idea. As such, we didn't do much testing. We excluded most of the back-end stuff we'd like to have but was not absolutely essential for basic operations (mainly automation of some tasks). This worked because we can do most of the required tasks for a small number of customers by hand in the mean time. This has been very successful and has been helpful on a number of levels -- we know our core customers quite well, they get personalized service and seem to be very loyal, and we were able to launch much earlier. The idea was to avoid spending a lot of time in development/testing in case things didn't go well.<p>Now that we know there is a place in the world for our product we can build a 2.0 version with everything we want/need in it. Plus, given our experience in the field and with the customers, we have a much better idea of what exactly our software will need to handle. Rather than mod our product to fit the requirements, we'll just build a new one and migrate the existing data. In the mean time we have some grass roots growth and customers who give us constant feedback.<p>I would note that if you are seriously looking at the possibility of growing very quickly then you probably don't want to use a throw-away MVP. If we got hit hard right now we would be in a tough spot for a few weeks (maybe more). Since our niche is rather small we felt a bit more comfortable taking on this risk.",1294487355

2082883,comment,2082807,2082807,0,0,pierrefar,,,"I can't agree more. One of the most annoying things I gripe about my quite-recent TV is that when I turn it on it says ""please wait"". No, it's a TV and it needs to be on virtually instantly. It's not like it has electronics that need to ""warm up"". It's just a slow software + hardware combination.<p>This is not to mention that some TVs I've seen are slow to respond to user commands because of slow software. Next time you press the remote to change the channel, think about the delay between your press and the TV registering the request, let alone changing the channel.<p>Let's not forget that computers take a while to boot up too. However, at least the industry understands that turning on machines should not take long and they're trying to shorten it. Ubuntu and Apple come to mind. Even Microsoft has made noises about this, and some CES 2011 gadgets I've read about mention it too.",1294486842

I remember our tutors being so frustrated at the whole process they ended up telling us click by click what we had to do to complete the tasks.

2082876,comment,2082505,2082779,0,0,demallien,,,"Well, ironic in the sense that the GPL is supposed to keep software free (libre), but in this case, it really restricts the end user by not allowing them even to load the app.  You have to wonder who was being hurt by having GPL software on the App Store - if you're an actual iPhone developer, then you can most certainly download the source provided by Applidium under the GPL, and build your own copy of the software.  If you're a dev that works on other platforms that uses the same GPL code, you can still download the code and use it.  If you're not a dev, then you couldn't care less about access to the code or not, because as a non-dev, you can't use it.  So just who's rights were being trampled on by the code being on the App Store?<p>Remi's stance is not principled.  Everyone that would want to have access to the source had access to the source. He has done this because of some idealogical dislike that he apparently has of the Apple ecosystem.  Fine, it's within his rights, but he doesn't get to claim that he was the principled one in this incident, quite the contrary.",1294486465

Does the government have any kind of interest to manipulate this system from the inside to respond to its needs? 
The federal intelligence community for one would be very interested by creating fake identities for its operatives thus creating a potential security hole for others to exploit.

8059618,comment,8059283,8059283,11,0,DSMan195276,,,"This looks like a fairly good read for C programming, but it does seem to be showing it&#x27;s age and has some (now) misinformation. The Copyright is 1996 to 1999, so from what I&#x27;ve looked at this is all C89, no C99 which is what you&#x27;ll probably see at this point if you look at some C code.<p>I admit to not having read the entire thing, but I&#x27;ve looked through most of it. A few things that stood out to me:<p>1. They dance around what a multidimensional array in C actually is, and the line &quot;C does not have true multidimensional arrays.&quot; is simply false. I&#x27;d let it go, but there&#x27;s a disconnect from when they go from sections 23 and 23.1 to section 23.2. Section 23.2 is most definitely <i>not</i> a multidimension array. Allocating an actual multidimensional array is actually much simpler, just malloc a block of memory into a pointer to an array:<p><pre><code>    int (*a)[3] = malloc(2 * 3 * sizeof(int));\n</code></pre>\nThis allocated array works just like any other multidimensional array in C and can be passed as such, and it&#x27;s much easier to use then the pointer-to-pointer approach. The pointer-to-pointer approach is the only one shown though, as though it&#x27;s the only option, even though it&#x27;s not equivalent.<p>2. In section 18.1.7, type qualifiers, they say &#x27;const&#x27; is fairly rare to see. That may have been true when this was written, but in properly written code today it should be decently common to see, mostly in the case that functions are receiving pointers to data they shouldn&#x27;t be changing and for string literals that shouldn&#x27;t be changed. Not using const correctly is a source for lots of annoying compilation warnings and runtime errors.<p>3. The very end of section 20.1 notes that there is no way to define a variable argument macro. That was true at the time of writing (kinda), but it&#x27;s not true with C99.<p>4. In section 18.3.1, the switch statement, everything&#x27;s perfectly fine except that where it says it&#x27;s common to use a list of #define&#x27;s over a switch. It&#x27;s much better to use an enum type to do so since it can annotate your code a bit better, acts basically the same way, you&#x27;ll get better compilation warnings from it, and in most cases you can let the compiler assign the numbers for you and thus not risk any conflicts from adding and removing options. For whatever reason, I couldn&#x27;t find any info on enum&#x27;s in the entire read, which is a huge red-flag.<p>5. A lot of their function pointer information involves pointers defined as:<p><pre><code>    int (*p)();\n</code></pre>\nThe huge issue with that is that they defined it with an unknown parameter list, and it was <i>intended</i> by the author. There are basically zero times when you actually want to do that, in most cases you should either include the argument types, such as:<p><pre><code>    int (*p)(int);\n</code></pre>\nOr put void to indicate no arguments:<p><pre><code>    int (*p)(void);</code></pre>",1405832253

The process is extremely well laid out here.<p>matasano.com/careers<p>We&#x27;ll get on the phone and talk to you about the company and what our work looks like. At the end of this call you should have a good idea of what we do, how our hiring process works, and answers to questions about Matasano. Most importantly, you&#x27;ll have a contact at Matasano to talk with and bounce questions off of through the duration of our process.\nWe do 1-3 technical phone screens. You&#x27;ll talk to a senior Matasano team member who will ask you about your technical background and talk you through scenarios and concepts from our day-to-day work. If you&#x27;ve been doing app security for 5 years, you&#x27;ll be talking about your past projects; if you&#x27;re a developer, you&#x27;ll be talking about code.\nWe do a web app challenge. Most software written within the last several years is web code. Everyone on our team needs to be able to deliver a solid web pen test. When you&#x27;re ready, you&#x27;ll be given an instance of a vulnerable web application and an hour or so to break it. We timebox challenges to avoid taking too much of your time. You&#x27;re doing this on your own schedule, in your own comfortable setting.\nWe do a custom protocol challenge. Every Matasano team member routinely runs into exotic network protocols. We&#x27;ll throw something at you that you&#x27;re unlikely to have worked with before and watch you reason your way through breaking it. This challenge seems to be everyone&#x27;s favorite; candidates routinely tell us how they particularly enjoyed it. That&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s part of our day-to-day work here. Like the web challenge, it&#x27;s timeboxed and you&#x27;re doing it remote.\nWe&#x27;ll have you write a fuzzer. Everyone here writes fuzzers. We&#x27;ll give you a file format. In the language of your choosing, you&#x27;ll write a fuzzer for it. This gives us a chance to see how you code and to see what types of things you automate testing for. Like the other challenges, this one is time limited and you can do it remote.\nWe&#x27;ve talked. We&#x27;ve done phone screens. We&#x27;ve answered questions. You&#x27;ve done challenges for us. At this point we both have a pretty good idea whether you&#x27;ll be happy working with us. If that&#x27;s the case, we&#x27;ll bring you onsite for an in-person interview, which concludes our hiring process.",1405831513

8059560,comment,8059237,8059237,9,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Excellent article - I recently worked on some pathfinding stuff and the material I found on A* was not that great but this is very well laid out.<p>Important side note: A* or other &quot;best path&quot; algorithms are not always preferable - there are some situations where it makes sense to use even less ideal paths in exchange for greater speed and less memory usage - even ones that are faster than greedy-best-first search with A* shown here.<p>If you use recursive backtracking with a decent set of heuristics (i.e. choose the node with the closest distance to the goal, &quot;as the crow flies&quot;), it can be be fast and ideal in many situations (it will always give an ideal path when there are few hook or concave shapes to deal with, which in many games or applications is often the case). It can be done in linear time and memory - it is important to note the cost of adding and searching nodes in the algorithm as well. It will never &quot;fail&quot; but it will produce very bad paths sometimes in complex situations, although even then it occasionally produces ideal paths.  In many situations where having an ideal path is not critical (say, townspeople just walking about doing their business) this can work well. Of course, you can use multiple algorithms or even mix them depending on what you are trying to achieve. RBT can be a good starting point just because it is so easy (maybe the easiest fail-safe algorithm outside of brute force?).<p>Secondary note: it is also good to subdivide your space - it does not need to be something complex like a sparse octree (in fact, that will make it harder to write and get good performance with in many situations).  Rather consider something like two levels of nodes.  On a 2D map, say you were to divide it into subsets of NxN grids of nodes.  Each one of these node grids attaches to its neighbor based on whether or not it is traversable in that direction (i.e. no matter where you enter the node grid, there is a path out in that direction).  This allows you to easily find a &quot;high level&quot; path which can be rapidly changed or discarded based on changing circumstances.",1405829616

8059557,comment,8030314,8035069,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Kafka&#x27;s topics are also queues, unlike RabbitMQ where a queue is <i>bound</i> to an exchange, and you publish by posting messages to the exchange, not the queue; the exchange determines which bound queues get the message.<p>This binding uses a <i>routing key</i>, which is a path that supports wildcards. For example, a consumer can bind its queue to an exchange &quot;foo&quot; (representing an app&#x27;s events) using the routing key &quot;create.photo.*&quot;. It will get &quot;create.photo.5378&quot; and so on. It won&#x27;t get &quot;update.photo.5378&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a really nice, flexible system that allows you to separate publishers from consumers without incurring much of a performance hit; if nobody is listening to a particular key, nothing happens, and if multiple groups of consumers listen to overlapping keys, they still get the messages in the correct order, because each message goes into a single queue.<p>Kafka&#x27;s topics, being queues, doesn&#x27;t allow this. Publishing is done to a topic, and consumers must also consume from that topic. One message, one topic.<p>There are three options:<p>1. Use a single topic for different (heterogenous) messages. For example, &quot;foo&quot; could be the topic, and each message would contain a field called &quot;path&quot; or similar (eg., &quot;photo.5378&quot;). Each consumer would filter out messages it&#x27;s not interested in based on this path. This puts a potentially expensive burden on the consumer.<p>2. Create several topics, and let consumers listen to each one: &quot;foo.create&quot;, perhaps (all create events about different objects), or &quot;foo.photo&quot; (all events about photos) or even &quot;foo.create.photo&quot;. This adds complexity and will potentially explode the number of queues needed for many apps, object types, events, etc. Moreover, since message delivery order guarantees are per topic, messages across different types can come out of order: deletes before creates, for example.<p>3. Invert the relationship; a producer must know every possible consumer&#x27;s range of interest, and post to each of their topics. Foo must know that app &quot;bar&quot; is only interested in photos, and that app &quot;baz&quot; wants events about all types of objects. Of course, this breaks separation of concerns (although the routing table could go into something like ZooKeeper)<p>Kafka could implement a similar routing system if it wanted to, of course.",1405829547

This is admittedly a harder sell, since the SA-11 definitely needs a trained operator and Russia&#x27;s GRU is known to be leading much of the action on the rebels&#x27; side in Donetsk. But it&#x27;s at least possible to train a rebel operator to do nothing else but operate an SA-11 without also training them extensively in the doctrine of when and why you&#x27;d actually use one.<p>This leaves the question of <i>why</i> they decided to turn on the SAM set at the time they did and shoot down the plane they did... but that can be explained by the rebels thinking that there would be a military resupply flight coming in over the area at a certain time, they turn on the set and &quot;oh look at that, an airplane just where we expected it to be&quot;. This &quot;proof&quot; would be horrific to any professional anti-air unit, but again you can see how the theory that a bunch of barely-trained &quot;rebels&quot; that happened to acquire an advanced Russian SAM can&#x27;t be completely disproven either.<p>I&#x27;m certainly no Russia apologist, and even if the &quot;rebels legitimately screwed up and didn&#x27;t mean to shoot down a civilian airliner&quot; theory is true, that doesn&#x27;t really reduce the blame for Russia. After all, if we&#x27;re assuming the rebels in Donetsk are really rebels and not simply disguised Russian military or GRU units with token Ukrainian participants, then Russia providing these &quot;rebels&quot; a SA-11 set could only have led to something like this happening eventually, the only surprise is that it happened so quickly after Russia provided the SA-11 set.<p>But I find it hard to believe that even Russia would <i>deliberately</i> target a civilian airliner, or knowingly allow whoever these separatists are to do the same. An inadvertent shoot down of a perceived military flight seems the most likely scenario, it just doesn&#x27;t turn off the blame for Russia like people might think.",1405829050

It gets complicated already when you want to beyond a pipe - e.g. A graph like a makefile. Then you need to leave the pipe metaphor in nost cases and deal with artifacts like files. Even more so, map-reduce was a big shift that went beyond the unic metaphor.<p>2. There was a different metaphor that had its merits: object composition through standard interfaces, e.g. OLE/COM and the likes. One might argue about its implementation (embedding a Visio object in a Word document still produces crashes, 25 years later), but as a UI metaphor it was very powerful.<p>3. The web&#x27;s metaphor is coupling of disparate content through URLs and HTTP (and HTML). One of the most mind-boggling metaphors ever introduced to man (talk about doing one thing well). Today we use REST APIs as the atomic pieces (do one thing well) and Javascript/ObjectiveC/Java as glue. Same thing.<p>4. As for application it goes, &quot;Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp&quot; (Greenspuns tenth rule). Slightly updated this means that as programs get more complex, they tend to become more integrated abd customizable, to the point where you use a high-level language to glue the different parts. If you&#x27;re lucky they may have replaced a custom common lisp with a mature V8 engine, but the lore is still the same.<p>5. Outside of academia, people (product managers in particular) tend to be focused on solutions, not abstractions. And for good reason: solutions are often shortcuts for common applications of abstractions, and therefore they provide lots of value. File.ReadAllLines() vs. doing the same with 3-4 Java classes in the old days is the best example.<p>6. In the end, we need people to think about abstractions: unix pipes, map-reduce, URLs. And we need other people who think about solutions: The IPhone, the Google world etc.<p>7. As for the OP: curl might be a good start of a pipe.

But it turns out that&#x27;s not a very good idea, and virtually every retail investor is much better off investing in the market as a whole than they are in trying to pick stocks.<p>I&#x27;m asking: how could the situation be any better with companies that <i>at best</i> have a 1/10 chance of <i>not abruptly ceasing to exist</i> within 2 years?<p>Individual startup equity for retail investors is a bad financial product. We all know that to be true; it&#x27;s weird that we&#x27;re somehow able to pretend otherwise for the sake of argument.",1446286221

It&#x27;s not the goal of the american justice system to fairly enforce the law and to rehabilitate criminals so they can reenter society.<p>The evidence that the current &quot;tough on crime&quot; approach doesn&#x27;t work is utterly overwhelming, but that doesn&#x27;t matter in the least if building a more just society isn&#x27;t the goal in the first place.<p>The reality is that the justice system is two-tiered. As long as powerful people don&#x27;t get crushed by the system there&#x27;s no real incentive for them to enact change. The American public is convinced only real criminals get treated inhumanely; it can&#x27;t possibly happen to <i>them</i>. So they don&#x27;t demand change from their politicians.<p>And so the cycle of police abuse, minimum sentencing laws, plea bargains and other brutality continues. The victims of the system are utterly expendable economically, and the public doesn&#x27;t care or even notice what&#x27;s going on.<p>See for instance &quot;With Liberty and Justice for Some&quot;, by Greenwald (the guy who published the Snowden leaks)",1446285994

I am not talking about that kind of sophistication.<p>The kind I&#x27;m talking about is the kind that tells an investor &quot;don&#x27;t invest in just one startup, because for the math to work on startup investing, you&#x27;ve got to invest in 10 startups, each of which have a 1/10 chance of success&quot;, and then the kind of sophistication that (a) knows how to secure the dealflow to make that kind of investment strategy work and (b) still be OK if it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Virtually no retail investor has any experience executing that kind of strategy. In fact: most professional VCs can&#x27;t either: the asset class as a whole has historically lost money, and is subsidized by asset allocation rules at the large financial funds that plow money into VC firms.<p>Most startups fail; most of <i>the good</i> startups fail.<p>I agree: if it&#x27;s just $100, who cares? But that&#x27;s not how retail investors approach the markets they&#x27;re allowed to invest in now. Maybe the JOBS Act should have capped the amount people can invest per year.",1446285806

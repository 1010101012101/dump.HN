In taking investor money, operators assume some responsibility for generating returns for them. Nobody would invest without the promise of those potential returns.

Examples include\nauto repair, auto body repair, grass mowing\nand landscaping, plumbing, residential and\nsmall business electrical, roofing, \ncarpentry (e.g., for a deck), swimming pool\ninstallation, dentistry, family practice\nmedicine, restaurants of various kinds from\nfranchised fast food to pizza carryout,\nItalian red sauce, French bistro, and Chinese\ncarryout, a hardware store, a restaurant\nsupply store,\na huge range of <i>big truck, little\ntruck</i> businesses where the owner buys in\nlarge quantities and sells in small\nquantities, independent insurance\nagency, medical testing lab,\nand many more with variety too large\nto characterize.  E.g., in my neighborhood\nthe shrubbery around a house was too large.\nSo, a team came in with a simple chain saw\nand a few simple tools, and cut way back all\nthe green, loaded it on a large sheet of plastic,\ndragged it to some woods, and piled it where\nit will slowly decompose into &#x27;soil&#x27;.  Apparently\nthe team was recently from Mexico, but they\nhad a nice, new pickup truck.<p>There are millions of such businesses in the\nUS where the owner, sole proprietor makes\nmoney enough to be a good breadwinner, and\nthe more successful such owners make money\nenough for a vacation house, a restored\nmuscle car and other toys, and a\n50&#x27; yacht.  In my area it appears that the\nelectricians work four day weeks, i.e., \nFriday is golf day.<p>For example, a guy good at managing\n10 fast food restaurants can pay himself\nover $1 million a year.<p>Flatly, these business people definitely\ndo know how to &quot;run&quot; their businesses.\nEven a guy recently from Mexico,\nChina, or India can quickly learn how to &quot;run&quot;\nhis business.<p>(2) For &quot;mega-successful high-growth tech startup&quot;,\nif this is a serious problem, then there is\nan easy solution:  Convert the business to a\nmega-successful low-growth tech startup.\nGenerally conversion from low-growth to\nhigh-growth is challenging but conversion\nfrom high-growth to low-growth is easy.<p>A guy in business who is able to get plenty\nof paying customers can get a lot of advice\non how to run a business from\nbookkeepers, accountants, lawyers,\nbusiness insurance agents, bankers, friends,\nmentors retired\nfrom business, etc.\nIt works, everyday, all across the US,\nin many millions of cases.  It&#x27;s \nputting kids through Ivy League\nuniversities, paying for family\nwinter ski vacations and\nsummer boating/fishing vacations,\npaying for high end cars from\nMercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Lexus, etc.,\npaying for single family homes\nat $500,000+, etc., and rarely with\nany formal training in how to run a\nbusiness.<p>The general idea that <i>how to run a business</i>\nis really obscure knowledge\nis wacko; tell that to a guy\ndoing well mowing grass \n-- three teams, each with about\n$100,000 in equipment --\nwith much less than a high\nschool education, poor knowledge\nof English, and recently from\nMexico without benefit of <i>papers</i>.<p>If an <i>information technology</i> business\ncan get customers and revenue, then\nhow to &quot;run&quot; the business is \nsomething many millions of sole proprietors\nlearn on the job and not\nsome secret, black art.",1388155530

And in fact the first uncountability proof comes in two flavours.  This is explicitly a re-casting of those two versions of Cantor&#x27;s first proof.<p>More explicitly, one version of Cantor&#x27;s first proof has you list the algebraics, take an interval, find the first two algebraics <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in the interval, reduce the interval to [a,b], and continue.  This has various technical issues.  What if there aren&#x27;t two algebraics in your interval (although there always will be, because they&#x27;re dense, but the argument goes through for any list, not just algebraics, so we need to consider this possible eventuality if we&#x27;re using the full generality.)  What if the interval doesn&#x27;t converge to be of length zero? (Which again, for the algebraics, it always will.  And again, if we use the argument in general we need to allow for this.)  And so on.<p>The second version of Cantor&#x27;s first proof avoids some of this by saying: find just the first algebraic in the interval, then choose a smaller sub-interval that avoid it, any carry on.  Again, for algebraics the interval will go to length zero, but for a general list that won&#x27;t necessarily be the case.<p><pre><code>  > Describing the sequence at the end as something that seems like\n  > it should converge is a bit unconvincing -- it&#x27;s a sequence\n  > explicitly defined not to land on an algebraic number.

This is hardly surprising and kind of presupposes\n  > the result.\n</code></pre>\nI think you&#x27;ve mis-read the argument.  We produce a succession of nested intervals.  For a given algebraic, eventually every interval will not include it.  That means that no algebraic is in more than finitely many intervals.<p>The we consider the left end-points.  That&#x27;s an increasing sequence that&#x27;s bounded above.  The reals are complete, so that sequence must converge.  But by construction the limit can&#x27;t be an algebraic.<p>The comment that the sequence &quot;seems like it should converge&quot; is pointing out that completeness is one of the things we expect of the number line, and it&#x27;s a way into giving that concept a technical meaning.<p><pre><code>  > And why divide the interval into thirds? This seems to be\n  > a result of confusing a different Cantor proof (that the\n  > measure of the rationals/algebraics in [0,1] is zero, which\n  > involves dividing things into thirds) with the first proof.\n</code></pre>\nNo, it&#x27;s a way of being explicit in the choice of the sub-interval.  I sometimes use fifths.  In that way I can discard the end sub-intervals, discard any sub-interval that touches or contains the given algebraic, and thus the end-points are <i>strictly</i> increasing, and not just increasing.  I didn&#x27;t do that here, and you make me wonder if it&#x27;s worth changing it, so people don&#x27;t (incorrectly) make the connection with Cantor dust.<p>But no, this isn&#x27;t confusing the construction of Cantor dust.<p><pre><code>  > If we accept the argument at all I don&#x27;t see how it requires\n  > three intervals at each step.

Major world economies are in a state of war since the whole past decade. None of these are under RBI or Government of India&#x27;s control.<p>Only and only thing makes a currency depreciate in its value, and that is increasing the money supply by the Central bank. Even if the currency is being dumped by a foreign nation which purchased it in past, it still is merely a delayed loss of value being visible.<p>Plus what the hell does the war in the past decade have to do with inflation of last year. Indian rupee was in low 40s, and now it has gone to high 60s, only and only the entity which is allowed to issue Indian rupee is responsible for it(measuring it in dollars is just an expression, I can measure it in kgs of wheat too and it will be the same problem).",1388152933

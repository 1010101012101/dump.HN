Also the choices on the right stop scrolling<p>It has potential, but the interface needs work.<p>Also some of the G's are cut off on the right side.",1227023967

368325,comment,368173,368173,0,0,SingAlong,,,"It's a nice idea. The design is cool. But you could change the design for the blog pages. Coz these blog pages shouldn't be focusing more on the site and should focus on the content posted by the users.<p>On the blog pages, Just move the event details to the right above the <i>what is blabify</i> thing.
So then you would get the space to move the user content to the top. Also take the way Blogger presents blogs as an example for blog pages. On the blog pages just remove the big logo and the big nav links and create a small navigation bar with those links (like the one you see on Ning networks or Blogger blogs). This could help user interface nicely.<p>Live blogging. This can be done thru twitter, blogger, or any other service or app. Try and be a bit different. When people have those guys out there, why do you think they will consider you? Directing my thought this way automatically gives me an idea. You could create a feature for users to auto-post to their respective services once they post on your service. This would also save time to those who have use other services. (And might be a killer feature).<p><i>""0844 : tes2""</i><p>what's that 0844?<p>Nice idea. Good luck!<p>P.S: I see Kiva ads already(?)",1227023740

368306,comment,368164,368224,0,0,jcl,,,"It is unlikely that power consumption has anything to do with the restriction.  For one thing, you can write wasteful code just as easily in a compiled language as in an interpreted language, and I have never heard of Apple rejecting an application because it computes in a wasteful fashion.<p>And interpreted languages can run nearly as efficiently as compiled ones for many user-oriented tasks, because most of the time the application is in an idle state waiting for user input.  This is why there is interpreted Java bytecode running on <i>nearly every other phone</i>.<p>And the phone already interprets Javascript, which is even less efficient than Flash.  If Apple is willing to let the user choose whether or not to waste their cycles browsing Javascript-heavy pages, why not give them the same option to run wasteful applications?<p>No, this is entirely about controlling the routes of execution.",1227022765

368298,comment,368126,368260,0,0,jbert,,,"I don't know how varied the possible DRM policies are, but it would seem possible to implement a 'generation counter' for DRM'd media which would restrict the number of copies.<p>e.g. the output of a video camera could be tagged with ""allow 3 copies only"". Each DRM-aware copy produced would decrement the # of allowed copies. The copied file would have an allowed-count of 0.<p>If a EURion-like image triggered this mode on the camera then that would probably be sufficient for manufacturers to avoid liability, but still serve to effectively close the ""analog hole"" (not really analog, but hey).<p>Yes, it all does seem unlikely.

368293,comment,368193,368193,0,0,rapind,,,"I don't agree with Jeff or Steve. Mainly because a lot of programming is about thinking, reading, googling, and copy / paste.<p>However, a couple weeks ago I did read Steve's original post on this and decided that since I wasn't a great typist I couldn't really argue that it is or isn't a hindrance for coding. So I began learning to touch type. Since Steve's post I've put in approximately 1 hour (sometimes more) a day using a course I paid for. My words per minute is up to about 50 (I used to be around 35 with my own invented way of typing), however I've still seen no speed increase while programming because of all the symbols and numbers, so I'm still at it.<p>I still don't think it'll have much of an impact on my quality of code or rate of production. Most of my time is still spent thinking, reading, googling ;)<p>IMHO, anyone saying that typing is the most important skill for a programmer is being silly.

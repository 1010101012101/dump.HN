9780544,comment,9779712,9780056,0,0,msandford,,,"> I think they&#x27;re right -- I, too, have observed a disconnect between how polished people sound when they talk about their work and what happens when they actually have to write code.<p>I&#x27;ve done a lot of work that people would probably find very interesting and useful.  But I tend to choke on whiteboard code interviews because they&#x27;re so high stakes.  Any time spent thinking about the problem looks bad, so you have to talk a lot.  But I can&#x27;t really think and talk at the same time.  So I end up talking rather than thinking and I do poorly.<p>Now obviously I&#x27;m going to push to move the status quo towards something that doesn&#x27;t put me at a competitive disadvantage.  So we both know that I&#x27;m biased.<p>But the idea that people can talk about what they&#x27;ve done and answer any questions that you have (about what they did and programming in general) but still screw up on the actual &quot;coding&quot; part might mean that the part where you make them write code is more noise than signal.<p>The problem is that you never find out because if someone bombs the coding part you simply chuckle and say &quot;well that person is clearly a liar, or something!&quot; and they don&#x27;t go any further in the hiring process.  So they never get hired, and because they&#x27;re never hired, you can&#x27;t evaluate their work performance.  Which might be excellent when they&#x27;re not being actively scrutinized by multiple people all at the same time in a high stakes situation.<p>Unfortunately to try and get some objective data on this you&#x27;d have to hire several people who talk about their projects well but don&#x27;t do well on the coding part.  An understandably impossible task unless your client is a Google or Microsoft and they know it&#x27;s just a big experiment regarding hiring.<p>But until someone does that and reports back (and they won&#x27;t because it&#x27;ll be a competitive advantage) it&#x27;s tough for me to swallow the &quot;talks good but can&#x27;t code so NOPE&quot; that I tend to see bandied about.<p>Putting someone in a pressure cooker and then measuring their performance will only tell you how they perform in a pressure cooker.  Which is usually quite distinct from what they&#x27;re going to do day-to-day.",1435262382

9780542,story,,,62,54,wrp,"Ask HN: APL family instead of R for data analysis?",,"I&#x27;ve read a lot about the APL languages, but never used them because I felt they were too specialized. Recently, I&#x27;ve been roped into some projects using R. I fully understand why R is so popular in statistics departments, but programming in R has been the most migraine inducing experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a language.<p>Since R is an array language, I though maybe an APL family language would work as a replacement. It wouldn&#x27;t have the multitude of libraries that R has, but would have a clean design. Note that I am not thinking of this as an alternative for the typical R user, who is a non-programmer and for whom R is their first and possibly last language. I&#x27;m thinking of a moderatly experienced programmer who is faced with a data analysis task.<p>Some APL derivatives, like J and Dyalog APL, have had their capabilities extended well beyond simple array juggling. How are they, compared to R, as data analysis environments?",1435262349

9780539,comment,9779312,9780418,0,0,bradleyjg,,,"Prepayment is a problem for the lender, not the borrower. Instead of just having to account for default risk, you also need to worry about the borrower repaying early. While that doesn&#x27;t seem like it a big deal, it can be. If the bank expects to get twenty five more years worth of interest payments at 5%, the prevailing rate has now fallen to 3%, and you pay off the loan early, it has lost a lot of income it was expecting.<p>In many other countries fixed rate mortgages typically contain a prepayment penalty to compensate banks for this risk, but US mortgages almost never contain such provisions.",1435262315

9780535,comment,9779712,9779712,0,0,s_q_b,,,"I agree we need an alternative to resume-based hiring, and the hiring process in general.<p>For example, I don&#x27;t do well in whiteboard interviews, which is odd because I normally don&#x27;t have a public speaking issue. It feels like there&#x27;s some muscle memory attached to coding that isn&#x27;t well replicated with poor handwriting in a room full of people.<p>Whiteboard lines of code are simply not the manner in which developers work once hired. That is the reason for the disconnect between speaking well about projects (easy to verbally explain and sketch) and the programming portion (bizarre.)<p>Right the industry is doing the equivalent of interviewing lawyers by asking them to write a legal brief on a white board.<p>We&#x27;re testing the wrong thing: a proxy for the work, when we we could easily test the work itself.<p>I much prefer work sample tests rather than whiteboard Q/A as it better replicates the actual job. Give me a few hours with problems I would actually face on the job, my dev environment, internet access,  and a set of problems that truly reflect the work,  and I find it much more natural.<p>Is it too much to ask that an interview measure skills the job actually requires, in an environment that emulates the work?",1435262299

9780506,comment,9779583,9780202,0,0,Arjuna,,,"To add to the discussion, and to dangrossman&#x27;s analysis:<p>I offer the following recommendations. You should do these before considering any re-submission of your app:<p>1. I took a look at a cached version of your app&#x27;s page. I recommend removing all references to all competitor&#x27;s products. As an example, copy like this needs to be removed entirely:<p>&quot;Compare to voice assistants and chatbots such as Siri, Nuance, Dragon, Vlingo, Evi, Voice, VoiceSearch, SpeaktoIt Assistant, Skyvi and Google Now, as well as GPS navigation such as Waze, Scout, MapQuest, Navigon, Garmin, TomTom, MotionX, Yelp, etc.&quot;<p>This is in violation of Google&#x27;s keyword spam policy, as you are using references to, &quot;popular search terms and competitor apps.&quot;<p>2. Remove all user reviews from your app&#x27;s description section. For example, you need to remove the following line:<p>&quot;Users say: &#x27;After trying S-Voice, Assistant, Skyvi or Hound ...Robin is the best voice app of its kind; clearly the best choice for drivers in need of information on the road.&#x27;&quot;<p>This violates the section of the policy that states: &quot;Please do not include user testimonials in your app description. They tend to be dubious and are frequently utilized to include references to popular search terms and competitor apps in violation of the policies outlined here. Let your users speak for themselves via Play&#x27;s comment review system.&quot;<p>3. Remove all references to competitor apps in your actual app. For example, I see on the cached page that you have a reference to Siri in one of the screen images (e.g., the image that says, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you ask Siri?&quot;)<p>4. I checked out your website. Again, I recommend removing all references to competitor&#x27;s apps. For example, you directly compare your product to Siri on the following page, and use that product&#x27;s name at least 5 times: <a href=""http://robingets.me/robinlabs/html/technology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robingets.me/robinlabs/html/technology.html</a> . I recommend that you avoid this. Instead, the copy should position your technology to stand on the merit and strength of what it has to offer, in its own right.<p>Best of luck.",1435262044

Even relatively low-level stuff gets explained quite well. And also, try using the help system/apropos tool. It&#x27;s great for finding functions and variables. Lastly, you can always issue &quot;find-function&quot; or &quot;find-library&quot; which will take you directly to the source code.<p>> With some trial and error, I could find out if `(setq cursor-color &quot;White&quot;)` works.<p>Use iELM session for this (M-x ielm). You&#x27;ll get Elisp REPL, where you can write expressions and it&#x27;ll show you their values. In this case:<p><pre><code>  ELISP> cursor-color\n  *** Eval error ***  Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: cursor-color\n</code></pre>\nso, no.<p>> Or see if `set-blink-cursor-interval` exists.<p>In ielm:<p><pre><code>  (symbol-function &#x27;set-blink-cursor-interval) ;; (no, it doesn&#x27;t)\n</code></pre>\nVia help system: C-h a; then input the name.<p>> Or look up why `set-cursor-color` exists in the first place when surely it&#x27;s more consistent to just modify a config variable.<p>Don&#x27;t know why is is so, but you can possibly find some explanation in the source code. `set-cursor-color` is defined in /usr/local/share/emacs/25.0.50/lisp/frame.el.gz on my system on line 1223. You can get there with M-x find-function.<p>> Or find some best Emacs lisp practices online.<p>Does it really have to be online?

However, there is that issue when someone is either just starting out from college, who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of work experience or who hasn&#x27;t had the best of work experiences (usually not their fault). For these people the main thing that I look for and try to evaluate is their ability to learn on their own. The main thing to consider when reviewing a candidate like that is, if they aren&#x27;t as up to speed on the technology we need them to, how long do I think it will take to on-board them and get them self-sufficient on our platform. If someone does not have the best resume, but their Github profile is full of projects, even half finished projects, of them trying out different languages or frameworks or maybe making (or trying to make) contributions to open source, it usually makes it easier to say &quot;lets give them a chance,&quot; especially if they have been playing around with the languages/frameworks we use.<p>Hope that helps answer your question.",1435261443

Very, very far from &quot;zero overhead&quot;. There&#x27;s usually no way you can afford to allocate memory while processing an interrupt request! It&#x27;s simply too unpredictably slow. (Not to mention many synchronization mechanisms memory management usually requires, like mutexes, are simply not feasible at IRQ level. No process switching is possible, so a deadlock occurs.)<p>But some GC schemes could be fast enough even from an IRQ handler, if memory allocation is just something simple like an atomic add to top of heap pointer. As long as non-interrupt level routines, potentially running on an another core, have enough time to clean up the garbage.<p>Manual memory management seems to be at the end of its road when it comes to high core count systems, with tens or hundreds of CPU cores. Allocation and application side object lifetime synchronization and management will simply saturate any inter-core communication mechanism, limiting scalability. GC should be able to get around that limitation. At that scale, you could already dedicate one or more cores just for cleaning garbage.",1435261402

I ran my own business for 7 years, making content websites monetized through google adsense, building games, and freelancing, among other things. The primary source of revenue was adsense, and it paid the bills enough for me not to need a &quot;real job&quot; for years. 18 months ago, the adsense revenue started to dry up, and in an effort to make some additional income, I started looking for a normal job again.<p>I ended up reluctantly taking a job working for the State of California, mostly because the schedule was flexible and it was a 5 minute commute. In the last 18 months I&#x27;ve gotten two promotions, including one four months after I started which is unheard of in state service (and which my bosses had to fight HR to get). I spearheaded the acquisition and implemented of a version control system, which no one hear had ever used (they were just FTPing files all the time, risking overwriting of others&#x27; work etc), and got buy-in from all the developers who now say they couldn&#x27;t imagine working without it. I also now wear a variety of hats besides programming including sysadmin work, dba work, architecture design, etc. My bosses rely on me more and more everyday just for my opinions and advice, let alone the work I do.<p>Yet now, when I send out my resume, it&#x27;s almost always crickets.  A year and a half ago, when the first item on my work experience list was &quot;failed entrepreneurship&quot;, the response rate to my resume was about 80% (not even talking about interviews, just getting a response at all).  Now it&#x27;s more like 20%, all because the first item in my work experience section is my current job working in public service.<p>I admit, many of my coworkers probably deserve the reputation that public sector work has. A significant number of them are clock-watchers that the bosses don&#x27;t even try to assign anything important to, because they know they don&#x27;t give a shit and can&#x27;t easily be fired (union), they are just filling a chair waiting for their public pension to accumulate over 20-30 years.  Nevertheless, I also list on my resume all of the above, including the pioneering (for us) work I&#x27;ve accomplished here implementing version control etc.  I never intended to stay here more than a couple of years, but I also never intended for this job to have such a negative impact on my job prospects.<p>I think I am probably going to revise my resume to leave this job off completely, and just say I&#x27;ve been working for myself for 9 years instead of 7. I predict sadly that this will return the response rate back to what it was before I had this job.",1435261286

It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to want to discuss a particular instance of ignorance (&quot;the Confederate flag is a symbol of southern pride, nothing more&quot; <i>is</i> ignorance, and quite literally white-washes the history associated with the symbol), without bringing into question the handling of other injustices, e.g. the treatment of women in Islamic cultures. If every discussion about every topic had to include every possible similar scenario, then humanity would achieve very little.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relative_privation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relative_privation</a><p>The American flag does probably mean oppression and injustice for certain groups of people, both within the States and outside the States. The collective &quot;we&quot; could probably do better about how we reflect on those past injustices so as to do better in the future.<p>The more I read your arguments, the more I feel that you are cornering yourself into the position that you are trying to argue against. The symbol of the swastika can have many meanings, and context has not been collectively forgotten: if it&#x27;s spray-painted on a synagogue in the West by some angsty teenager, but has the orientation of the Buddhist peace symbol, is anyone really going to think that the kid was promoting world peace? Of course not. If the symbol&#x27;s painted on a truck for good luck on a food delivery guy&#x27;s rickshaw in some Indian city, is any visiting Westerner going to think that he&#x27;s a Neo-Nazi? No.<p>The closest comparison that I can draw between the swastika and the continued flying of the Confederate flag would be if some non-Hindu or Jainist in Germany tried to pass off their use of the swastika on their car as a good luck token. That&#x27;s a slap in the face to anyone (or their descendants) that had to deal with the atrocities promoted by the Third Reich. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what the continued flying of the Confederate flag amounts to: a slap in the face to those impacted by slavery and the culture surrounding slavery. You&#x27;re attempting to argue that the context surrounding the Confederate flag doesn&#x27;t actually exist anymore. The legacy of slavery (and its incipient inequalities) still exists to this day, so I find it quite a stretch to say that &quot;the Confederate flag is no longer a symbol of slavery.&quot; Who are any of us to individually decide whether or not it is still a symbol of slavery? I&#x27;m hard pressed to see it as a neutral symbol, when as recently as 60 years ago, legislators and citizens alike were passing it off as a cultural &quot;homage&quot; during the battle against integration. [1] There&#x27;s not much of a slippery slope argument to be made here: we aren&#x27;t talking about one or two people that are offended or impacted, we&#x27;re talking about an entire socio-/ethno-/econo-demographic that wouldn&#x27;t exist were the institution of slavery extinguished in a just manner. The flag is as plain a symbol as any for 1. the institution of slavery, 2. the socio-cultural romanticism of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; of the South, 3. the legacy of Jim Crow laws into the present day, and, 4. the continued inequalities faced by African-Americans at the short end of the stick of the previous three.<p>[1] (bottom of PDF pg. 33) <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141204200939/http://www.senate.ga.gov/sro/Documents/StudyCommRpts/00StateFlag.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20141204200939/http://www.senate...</a><p>EDIT: Do I think the Confederate flag should be removed from historical video games? No. Do I think it should be removed from any and all state offices? Yes. White-washing descriptions of history for the sake of hurt feelings is silly, but disallowing the adoration of symbols of cruelty and inequality promotes good nation building and the integration of communities.",1435261067

How might I confirm that this pattern is present?<p>To start, let&#x27;s look at movies that deal with &quot;Scientists, Engineers, Doctors, Researchers, Inventors, Explorers and People who do Amazing Things&quot;, from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/list/ls050940841/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/list/ls050940841/</a> . These include Apollo 13, Fat Man and Little Boy, Einstein and Eddington, Shackleton, Creation, Captain Cook: Obsession and Discovery, Gorillas in the Mist, Temple Grandin, Jobs, and Reach for the Sky.<p>Of the 31 films (though two are not biographies or based on real-life), 2 are about women (Gorillas in the Mist, Temple Grandin), and the rest are about men. Einstein is certainly high on the list of mythologized people, so mythologization is not limited to women. (Feynman would be another. Infinity (1996) is a biopic about Feynman, but it&#x27;s not on the list.)<p>Women appears underrepresented in that list compared to their modern presence in STEM fields. To be fair, the movies include Pasteur from the 1800s, and Harrison from the 1700s. Women were often strongly restricted from doing research in STEM fields during that time.<p>I saw one non-white person on that list, Vivien Thomas, from the 2004 film &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;.<p>&quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; from 1956 is &quot;The true story of airman Douglas Bader who overcame the loss of both legs in a 1931 flying accident&quot;, and Temple Grandin is autistic. However, since 1956 is rather a long time ago, it does point out the need for a baseline - if the percentage of movies about disabled people has been stable, then it&#x27;s not a growing pattern. As another example of someone who &#x27;received the mythology treatment&#x27;, consider &quot;Helen Keller in Her Story&quot; from 1954.<p>(Howard Hughes, in &#x27;The Aviator&#x27; (2004), may also fall into the mentally challenged category, due to his obsessive-compulsive disorder which was present already by the 1930s. I haven&#x27;t seen the film to see if it touches on his mental illness.)<p>Films about gay people would have been restricted under the Motion Picture Production Code, so not really seen in films from the 1930s to 1968. That would make it hard to establish a long term pattern. Still, as about 2% of the US adult population (1.2 to 5.6 according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_Unite...</a> ) identifies as LGBT, then about 2% of the films about famous people in STEM should concern someone LGBT.<p>It should not be hard to come up with an evaluation technique, like &quot;all biopics about people in STEM done as movies/made-for-TV movies in the US from 1970 to the present&quot;, and redo this same evaluation to see if there is a pattern.<p>The tricky part is to normalize it. If 2% of the population is homosexual, then what percentage should we expect to see portrayed as they are in movies? If 51% of the US population are women, and 27.9 percent of the PhDs in the physical sciences are women, what patterns should we expect to see in films?<p>Otherwise you might just be seeing the secular trend that more women are getting involved in STEM, that policies like the ADA make it easier for people with disabilities to get advanced educations, etc.<p>How have you done the analysis to determine if the patterns you see are due to the expected shift in population distribution of people in STEM, vs. any special sort of mythologization?",1435260873

I see Scalia&#x27;s scorn mostly directed at Congress and the Executive than his fellow justices, but he also has strong convictions about the judiciary rewriting laws to suit a perceived need, since it is strictly outside their function.<p>Any time you read about a major court case striking down a law, or some statue, you will typically see it accompanied with a very painstaking argument about how the judiciary cannot and must not simply change or reinterpret what is perceived to be a &quot;broken&quot; law. They can follow the law as it is written, or they can strike it down as unconstitutional, but they can never simply say, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the effect this law would have here, so I will just ignore it.&quot;<p>This is like a compiler simply ignoring explicit and functional lines of code because they lead to a crash. It might sound great that the program avoids a crash, but if the program isn&#x27;t running it&#x27;s own code anymore, then what code is it running?<p>In this case, the prevailing argument was that the law as written would destroy so much of what had evolved into regulatory practice so that they couldn&#x27;t bear to hold the Executive to its own rules. As you can imagine, this is a <i>difficult</i> precedent to set because it opens up an impossible hole in the innermost workings of the system design. I&#x27;m not a historian on this subject so I can&#x27;t really point to previous examples, but my understanding is the only &quot;proper&quot; fix here is an act of congress, and Scotus is rightly peeved to be put in the position where the executive branch is asking them to clear up a mess like this.<p>Another way to think of it -- it is congress&#x27;s fundamental duty to write and vote on the bills, and executive branch&#x27;s duty to sign them into law. The judicial must not and cannot write their own laws, no matter how much another branch might plead with them to do so in order to get them off the hook of actually <i>doing their job</i>. If the judiciary can rewrite laws that don&#x27;t suit the executive, it negates congress by giving the executive and judiciary branch far too much power. To those who say it was necessary in this case, just &quot;be careful what you wish for.&quot;",1435260668

It&#x27;s a waste of time. It&#x27;s interesting to note that the whole TDD movement comes from people who are working in dynamically typed languages.&#x27;<p>Unit testing in dynamically typed languages serves two purposes: 1) to prove code correctness, and 2) to prove code soundness/completeness, to show that the result of a function is correct for most or all input parameters. In statically typed languages 1) is already taken care of by the type system. If your code compiles then there are no glaring type errors in it and your code is correct. However, you still have #2 to worry about.<p>I work in Scala a lot where there is a static type system. I still have extensive unit tests, and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times it&#x27;s saved me when I&#x27;ve changed code in one area of the codebase, thought it was sound and complete, and then immediately become informed it&#x27;s caused tests to fail, even though it compiled correctly. For instance I&#x27;ll change code in a model and think that the controller will still behave the same way - and unit testing demonstrates immediately that it doesn&#x27;t. This is especially true when I didn&#x27;t write the controller that depends on the model. Testing also helps you rigorously test corner cases - when does this code throw an exception, when does it return a negative number, etc.? It really helps you get a good sense of when a piece of code is <i>done,</i> and move onto the next code.<p>Unit testing is indispensible both in static and dynamically typed languages, and I don&#x27;t think lots of coverage is a waste of time in static languages.",1435260320

It gained relevance in the post-war years as a response to the civil-rights movement.<p>That the change now happens so rapidly and so quickly can be directly attributed to the speed at which social consensus can change and crystallize due to the new communication technologies that we have.<p>But the real question that a lot of people are actively working on in relation to this is &quot;How do you manage and steer political legitimacy in the current environment?&quot;<p>Also remember that the flag in question is merely a symbol and that banning it does very little to reduce the racism and violence that claims it as a standard.

Instead of the always tabular response formats of SQL databases, you can tailor the response message format for each individual query to exactly what your application needs. You can also block your database for external users while maintenance jobs are being performed. These are just a few of the many key steps that we have taken to make the database management easier so that you can sleep better at night and focus more on their application development instead of operational tasks.<p>We are also going to release an alternative to the HTTP protocol, designed to be able to mimic HTTP when necessary, but also to be able to implement fully stateful communication sessions between clients and servers.<p>Please feel free to subscribe via http://vstack.co/ and let your friends and colleagues know about our beta invite.

The moment you hit some sort of scale, it becomes very very difficult, if not impossible to run and rely on such experiments.<p>E.g. in the first growth phase at Box, we were tasked with hiring 25 engineers a quarter. At that scale, the company deals with too many resumes and too many stakeholders in the hiring process. And at that point, you also have a group of people explicitly looking at resumes, less involvement from actual hiring managers, deadlines to meet, land to grab etc. Not saying one thing is better than the other, just that hiring at scale is an entirely different game.<p>The other thing, which is implied in the article, but may get lost if the reader isn&#x27;t careful: regardless of how a candidate is sourced, the interview bar still remains the same. i.e. AJ also must have had to clear same or similar technical interviews like other engineers that got hired there.",1435258852

4466887,comment,4463008,4465575,1,0,lgeek,,,"No technical reason really, it's about cost, demand and volume.<p>Cost is going to be a problem because of the high current involved in normal operation and even more so in case of a short-circuit.<p>Let's take a popular battery size, let's say 2200mAh 3S 25C. This battery should be able to safely support a discharge current up to 55A. For reference, a 10KW power shower draws less current than this from the mains network. Our smart battery controller needs to be able to measure the discharge current, and needs to be able to switch the output on or off.<p>You can just buy a hall effect based current sensor and a power transistor that will handle 55A. But these components need to survive in case of a short-circuit for long enough for a micro-controller to read the current at its regular polling rate and then turn off the transistor. Expect the short-circuit current to be a number of times higher than 55A.<p>So you end up with a parts list that costs you about $10 per unit for small quantities (500). Have I mentioned the price of the battery I was building this for? It's $13.<p>I've thought about building some for myself, but 1) they really should be mounted inside a hard case together with the battery and 2) I don't have a space where it would be safe to prototype this, assuming that a failure will happen.",1346590332

'Instant search' works on web-browsers because when you click on the title bar it automatically 'selects' all the text there, so the first letter you type will start a search (after deleting all the existing text in the title bar). This is not how a file manager would work. As you show, when you click on the title bar you want to 'edit' the current title...<p>I'd rather get rid of the 'back' and 'forward' buttons, which are quite extraneous for most users (browsing a file system is generally not like browsing the web). Agree that 'location' can go though.",1346588020

>The best any of them can do, however, is to make guesses as to what the optimal performance characteristics of the cache structure on each CPU is going to be.<p>Well actually most mainstream compilers support profile guided optimization which allows the compiler to do a good job of reorganizing the code to minimize instruction cache misses as the compiler then has runtime data which provides the necessary hot/cold codepath statistics.",1346588005

You could watch every event, live and delayed, and they would even bookmark the live stream as you watched it (and preserved for replays) with event markers.  This was particularly useful for track and field where you might want to skip around on various qualifiers and other events.<p>We never had a single issue with buffering or playback, and it was truly better than TV.  It definitely felt like the future.  I was really sorry our American friends in the USA couldn't experience the coverage like we had in the UK (without a VPN).",1346587824

It relies on peoples underlying hatred of work, personified by the boss, and sells the dream of autonomy by telling people that they can become their own, fake, boss.

They're both re-starting and revising over and over again.  I would guess that if the 30-year novel ever gets completed, it probably bears little resemblance to the original draft.

I developed a pretty solid MVP last summer and we now have  about 15 customers who have brought in approximately 50 users each that use our product as well. We started making a little bit of money through affiliate marketing, but have several revenue generating options planned for the future. Our business is somewhat seasonal, and the money we've made so far has been made in an off-season. But we see huge potential for growth and exponential increase in revenue as we get more customers.<p>We've been looking for angel investors to get us going, and through an acquaintance Mike found a group of 5 friends willing to invest. Unfortunately, Mike and I live in different cities (he's in SoCal, I'm in NorCal), so I wasn't there to pitch the investors. Anyways, they agreed to give us $100k for a 45% stake in our company. Originally we wanted to bring on a partner who would give us $80k for 33%, but the potential partner was dragging his feet too long so Mike approached this group of friends instead.<p>I was super excited to hear that we would get $100k, so I didn't say anything right away (which was probably stupid on my end), but 2-3 weeks have now passed and I'm starting to wonder if we're giving away too much equity. It's not that I am being greedy all of a sudden, but rather I'm worried that Mike and I would be left with 55% and if we needed/wanted to raise VC money later we would get diluted so much that we'd lose control of our company. On the other hand, it may be too late to convince the angels to give us 70k for 30% (though we haven't signed any agreements yet), because they would think we can't make up our minds (Mike had pitched them for 100k). Mike doesn't share this concern with me and he would rather have the extra 30k as a buffer, but if I insisted he would talk to the angels and see if they would be ok with the new terms (though that could hurt our credibility and they could change their minds entirely).<p>Do you think we're giving away too much equity? Should I insist on changing the terms? Or should I just let it go and worry about it later (if we ever even get to a point where we'd have to worry about it)?<p>Your advice is highly appreciated!",1332722769

There are other abstractions (aka levels/layers), such as virtual memory, the OS and the implementation of the CPU itself in terms of architecture, transistors, silicon doping.  (Sometimes these abstractions are said to still be ""leaky"" because to understand performance issues often requires knowing the underlying implementation - that's important but distinct from just knowing what it will do.)<p>A common criticism of git is that the abstraction is not clean - you need to know what it actually does underneath in order to predict that a command will do.  It's not just a problem of an inconsistent UI (though it is that), but that the user model that the command sets out (the abstraction) does not match up with what git will actually do.<p>The OP's criticism is that legit (great name BTW) doesn't address this: people will use this simpler, friendlier UI, and inexplicable and weird dangerous things will happen (e.g. data loss). C++ might blow your leg off, but git can make you never have existed.<p>NB: I haven't looked at legit closely enough to tell if this criticism is valid (and OP offers no support - OP, please elaborate).

Yes, public transportation sucks and you need a car. But the near-complete lack of zoning means that most of the places you need to go are relatively nearby, so if you live close to work (usually possible because as you note real estate is cheap), you won't be spending that much time in traffic.",1332720590

I don't really hear him gloat, it's just not something he uses except in the edge cases. He's adapted to that 1-2 hour wait time so far as I can tell.<p>A second one uses the buses to get to and from work and even when he comes over to hang out.

Most people like starting things. Note this is different from networking and so forth, which is really a separate skill altogether.<p>Employers, business partners and investors will look at what you've finished and don't care what you've started. When something is 80% done or when times are tough or it's time to soldier on and run the last mile of the marathon, nobody wants the guy around who says ""well, I started, that's my skill but I'm done now, I suggest you find a Finisher"".<p>Not being a Finisher isn't a different skill--it's a character flaw.",1332720160

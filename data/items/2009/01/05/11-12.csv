420300,comment,420225,420225,0,0,patio11,,,"Gah, you're about a week early for me to show you my article answering this question.  Here's the short version.<p>$1,000 will buy you about one feature worth of magazine quality pillar content plus effort to launch the content (by contacting relevant blogs, news organizations, etc).  The ROI on evergreen content over the long term is stupendous -- it brings in links like crazy (which translates into direct SEO benefits), brings in traffic for forever, and is just stupidly cost effective.<p>Here's a (cheaper) bit of evergreen content which is Pretty Darn Useful for my niche: <a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com/dolch-sight-words-bingo.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com/dolch-sight-words-bingo.htm</a> .  I think that probably took, with its sister page, 2.5 hours to put together, so call that $250.  (I have since become <i>vastly</i> more efficient at pumping out the content.  You can hear more about that in a week when the article is done.)<p>Those two pages have, at last count, something like 100 backlinks, including from some fairly high authority pages (""Would you mind if we included your resource in this year's copy of the [American state] reading curricula?"" <i>swoon</i>).  Buying links on that scale would cost me thousands of dollars <i>per month</i> (I do not recommend buying links).<p>That page alone had 30,000 visitors in 2008 alone.  Buying 30,000 visitors, <i>all of whom wanted something very close to what I sell</i>, would cost me about $1,800 via AdWords.<p>Direct revenue as a result of it was only about $1,000 in 2008.  (I say ""only"" because it is one of the most poorly monetized pages on my site.  I tried to strike a balance between monetization and linkability, mostly aimed at linkability since that was published before anyone had heard of me.)<p>So yeah, with $1,000, I'd suggest writing (or commissioning) some pillar content aimed straight at the people who you want to convince to give you money/influence.",1231156508

420296,comment,420225,420287,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have never issued a press release myself, but various people told me that I should. I am just thinking that Adwords are more of a ""one time"" investment: either somebody buys your product after clicking on the ad or not, but there are no longterm gains (except that you could reinvest the earnings from selling the product). It seems unlikely that somebody would decide to blog about your product after stumbling upon it via an ad, for example.<p>Therefore personally I prefer investments that have a potential for growth - like a press release might make bloggers write about my product, which might increase it's page rank and give an enduring boost to visitor numbers to my site. A google ad does not increase page rank.<p>Sure, with Google Ads it is simple maths, but my impression was also that it is very hard to make money with adwords. For example I was selling a mobile application where I would have earned about 2â‚¬ per sale, but relevant keywords cost around 10cent. So even if every 20ieth clicker would have bought the app (a very high conversion rate, I think), that would only have been the break even point.<p>As for the press release, I wouldn't spend 1000$. Actually one can make them for free, but with my app back then I just felt it might be good to pay someone who is more skilled at writing to do it.",1231156359

420287,comment,420225,420267,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I've got to say that sending out a press release if you only have $1000 is just not the best use of funds IMO. Press releases have their place but is it really what you spend your first $1000 on? No way.<p>Adwords seems the most logical choice. I'd spend $20 and buy Perry Marshall's Adwords book and learn how to do split testing. With a $1000, you shuld be able to generate enough impressions to figure out what keywords work, what your competitors are doing in Adwords, and have a handle on what your landing pages are doing. Once you have that then you can more ably spend the next $1000.<p>Here's that Perry Marshall book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Google-AdWords-Million/dp/1599180308/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231155345&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Google-AdWords-Million/...</a>",1231155366

However, I only have 288 karma points on reddit and I can get a reasonable success rate when I submit stuff there. The longer your account has existed and the more active it is, though, the better, of course.<p>Digg is a pain in the ass in that respect. The volumes of ""diggs"" required to even make a blip are so huge that you'll only make it there if either you've totally gamed it (like that guy who posted that article about it recently), or if you've made it through somewhere else and you're dugg as a side effect. I stopped bothering with it because I kept hearing that the quality of the traffic is also very low anyway (very high bounce rates).<p>Reddit and HN, however, are relatively easy to promote to, and if you get really picked up very well on reddit (which should happen with 1 article every few months if you're good and write reasonably often), it'll spread to other places too. Articles that succeed only on HN don't seem to spread around too much, however.<p>The best place so far, though, was Slashdot. Get yourself slashdotted (on their main page), and you can expect 100k+ hits from it, and many links from blogs, and probably you'll get reddited, delicious'ed, dugg, etc, soon after. Be sure that your server is ready to handle it... It's a complete lottery - an actual editor has to decide whether to push your article - but if you win it, it's worth it - so submit there when you have good slashdot content, it's free and might bring you untold amounts of geeky traffic!<p>Bear in mind also that none of these methods guarantee anything - not even traffic, and definitely no guarantee that people will stick around. But they're not overly hard to achieve if you're a decent writer and have something reasonably interesting to say (those are the hard bits, really).",1231153970

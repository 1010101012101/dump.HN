You must realize that much of HN -- I&#x27;m assuming this includes you -- lives in a bubble of left-leaning people from left-leaning urban areas.<p>Growing up in a different time and place, in middle and high school I always thought calling someone &quot;faggot&quot; or &quot;gay&quot; was roughly the same as &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;jerk&quot; or &quot;asshole&quot; -- a generic insult not meant to be taken literally.  And in the context of a multiplayer game, especially online, such a word is typically used to express momentary anger at the in-game situation, not trying to attack you personally.<p>It was quite a culture shock to me when I got to college and discovered that most people on campus viewed insulting someone by calling them a &quot;faggot&quot; to be political incorrectness of the same order as calling someone a &quot;nigger&quot; or &quot;retard&quot;.",1387497149

(Its a complicated story because the US was so different back then... there was the Federally-chartered &quot;Bank of the US&quot;, among other things)<p>To solve the Panic of 1819, President Monroe would nullify certain debts, to ease recovery. Sound familiar?? State-level banks then increased the monetary supply, and Congress passed more Tariffs to discourage exports/imports.<p>The one thing that is constant in this country&#x27;s 200 year history, is that the Federalists and the Non-Federalists have been arguing the cause and effect of government since the start. Federalists blame the &quot;free market&quot; of 1816 for causing the panic of 1819 (ie: It was inevitable due to Wartime debt from 1812 and a crisis in Europe). On the other hand, the Non-Federalists blame the centralized &quot;Bank of the US&quot; for setting off the panic.<p>---------------------<p>The one thing that is clear to me, is that the proud history of the US is for this debate to spin up every 20 years as the US hobbles from crisis to crisis. The President will do the same thing and step in and sponsor new laws... he&#x27;ll also forgive debts, the monetary supply will expand in some way, and Congress will pass something irrelevant to the discussion.",1387497023

People will either mine the currency, which is trading a service for the currency, or buy it on an exchange, which is trading one store of value for another. So the economy would be value-based instead of debt-based.<p>With a commodity like gold, when its value increases, people mine more of it because people want more. This increased supply reduces its value.<p>To me, the ideal currency is one in which you can get paid for performing a service, and 20 years later, the payment is still worth exactly the cost of that service.

One could then write a program that spawns off a ptrace&#x27;d child process and intercepts all syscalls and translates them from Linux syscalls to your OS&#x27;s syscalls.<p>As a bonus, ptrace would allow you to host a slightly modified copy of your kernel in userspace, similar to User-Mode Linux.

As one politician said, those who were called to the protest and misguidedly agreed but are now apologetic will be freed, but those who organized the violence and incited others to join in will not. And the president of Russia, addressing a meeting of leaders of the various regions and republics in the Federation as well as church, mosque and synagogue leaders, made it a point to state that Russian, unlike the EU and the IMF, will not demand Ukraine to take any particular internal actions in return for financial help and is only offering it to join in a customs union as a partner.<p>The above is all paraphrased from a couple of news reports in Russian that I watched last week.<p>There is a well known phenomenon in politics and society of the pendulum swing.

Meanwhile, the Russian Federation still holds out the Soviet Union as a standard of comparison -- it is their history after all -- and actively moves away from Soviet style solutions embracing capitalism and individual liberty to a far greater degree than Western countries.

I agree 100%, you don&#x27;t need to provide me with any evidence. That&#x27;s common sense. The same way males are better soldiers than females. I agree 100%.

Perl tries to Do The Right Thing (DTRT) whenever possible, and with this principle in play, I think the meaning of this statement is very obvious.<p>Even if we extend the statement to be somewhat more ambiguous, a bit of thinking about the problem makes it obvious what the right thing to do is, and it is indeed what Perl does:<p><pre><code>  print $x, $y if $x;\n  # OR\n  print $x, $y if $y\n</code></pre>\nYou can either interpret that as Perl does, or as:<p><pre><code>  print( ($x), ($y if $x) );\n  # OR\n  print( ($x), ($y if $y) );\n</code></pre>\nDo you ever really want something like that?  Is that useful to you, given that there are a few other ways of achieving that which are much less cumbersome ($y||$y)?<p><i>The point is that in any well designed product you shouldn&#x27;t have to study the docs (all that much) in order to start being productive. And there should be as few &quot;gotchas&quot; as humanely possible please. Did I say pretty please?</i><p>It&#x27;s almost comical that you are making this argument.  One of Perl&#x27;s strong points is that it&#x27;s really easy for someone to pick up and start using, because it tries to DTRT, making it very easy for the beginner.<p><i>Long-time Perl hackers tend to forget their first experiences with the languages (which for many with languages with far worse track records on the consistency / simplicity scale). But newer users have (rightfully) come to expect much better.</i><p>When I mention Perl, I <i>still</i> hear people immediately jump out with &quot;Oh, I remember I used Perl back in the day and it was real easy to whip up a little program to do what I wanted.&quot;<p>I think what you are running into is that you have experience and expectations with other languages, and when Perl doesn&#x27;t match those expectations, you blame Perl, rather than meeting it at it&#x27;s own level.  I suspect you don&#x27;t do this as much with languages that appear radically different, such as Haskell and Lisp.

However, I do support these guys, and for the last 3 days I saw the Telegram team diligently reply tech questions in Twitter, HN and blogs. I saw them collect questions from security experts and put up FAQs based on them <a href=\"http://core.telegram.org/techfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://core.telegram.org/techfaq</a> or <a href=\"http://core.telegram.org/contestfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://core.telegram.org/contestfaq</a> as well as update the obscure parts of their documentation.<p>>> Perhaps consider offering an alternative crypto suite based on standard protocols? In parallel with what you have. Just reuse an existing crypto framework and redo transport layer to your needs.<p>Again, I am not cryptographer. But as a person who wants his data to be secure I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with different teams trying different approaches. I 100% agree that people crave a good encrypted communication system, but I&#x27;m not sure it can be achieved in a world where everybody uses similar methods. What if some of the common &quot;best practices&quot; are intentionally promoted in the crypto-community as the best ones <i>exactly</i> because they contain flaws and backdoors?<p>Please allow me to give you an example of something that could be just that.<p>The Telegram team was criticized by some NH critics for their custom auth key exchange protocol. People asked – why take a random value from server and a random value from client and combine both with a creepy function? Why not, e.g., just generate a random value on the client and use RSA instead? Well, the answer is simple – the Telegram guys did not trust that the random value generated on the client-side was really random.<p>In August 2013 it turned out that their custom approach to protocol enabled Telegram to stay more secure when multiple other secure apps using more conventional solutions were hacked (<a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2013/08/some-secureran...</a>). Many Bitcoin apps were cracked and people lost money, Open Whisper Systems (I noticed these guys are aggressively promoted here in the NH community as the epitome of best security) had to hasten to patch their RedPhone app to avoid that vulnerability.<p>So I&#x27;m kind of suspicious when I see strong pressure to enforce the use of common techniques and get rid of uncommon ones just because they are uncommon. I think the Telegram guys have the right to choose their own path, and I&#x27;m sure our society will only benefit from it.<p>Of course, building custom solutions is no easy task and requires a lot of effort. But I&#x27;ve seen some of the Telegram guys (yes, the &quot;6 ACM champions&quot;) create things that I&#x27;d thought were impossible. Maybe I am wrong in putting my trust in their abilities, and I will be fined $200K+ for my naivete. However, I am willing to continue financing such contests, and I do hope that eventually we&#x27;ll all get something much more valuable than $200K.",1387494247

6938610,comment,6937431,6937431,127,0,SwellJoe,,,"I never realized just how bad the situation was until I got involved more seriously in activism. Two and a half years into being politically active enough to never go more than a week or two without some form of protest (which could take the form of a march or rally, or an Overpass Light Brigade, or helping organize a cryptoparty, hosting documentary movie nights, helping with direct action training, etc.), I now have literally dozens of friends who have been charged with felonies.<p>These are among the sweetest, and gentlest, people I know. Some are barely older than children (the youngest person I know charged with a felony was 19 when she was charged with &quot;Use of a criminal instrument&quot; for locking her arm to a fellow protesters arm using a device suggested and made for them by a team of undercover Austin Police Department officers).<p>It is completely transparent, to me, that these laws and these tactics, are tools of oppression. They are not &quot;to keep us safe&quot;, and never were. They are designed to make dissent as dangerous as possible through every means they can get away with. It includes violent, or at least threatening, police presence at any protest of significance (which means many populations cannot safely express dissent; anyone with warrants, regardless of what they are for, has no free speech because they will be snatched from a protest, anyone who is an undocumented immigrant has no free speech because they will be snatched, etc.). It includes violent arrest tactics; police are trained in &quot;pain compliance&quot; techniques, which include spraying pepper spray into protesters eyes, and forcing their eyes open to do so. It includes widespread spying at the local, state, and federal level, as well as spying by corporations like Stratfor. It includes charging activists with laws intended for violent terrorists, so that arrest is no longer a minor inconvenience, but a life-altering event. When non-violent activists are facing years in prison, for causing nothing more than minor temporary inconvenience, something is horribly broken.<p>I suspect most Americans would be disgusted by all of this, if they were really aware of it. But, it&#x27;s not very frequently reported in mainstream media. I only know about it because I know some of the people involved and follow activist-oriented news sources.",1387494137

I suppose I am a little biased against this kind of behavior. I run an online business and we occasionally have customers/others ranting about what we should or shouldn&#x27;t do, as if they have any idea what goes on behind the scenes or what went into our decision-making.<p>I get your point and they may well have to face regulatory matters when regulation catches up with Bitcoin in general. But, for now, they seem to have some guidance as to how they need to structure their processes to sidestep <i>current</i> regulations and precedent. Anyone who has experience with legal issues knows that the law is often gray. So, to wade into such waters, firms must rely on precedent and their good sense to guide them. It is a calculated risk, wherein the word <i>reasonable</i> becomes important. Whether they should be classified as an MSB or financial institution will be a finding based on facts. They need to line up as many facts in their favor as possible and not keeping funds on deposit or allowing limit orders works in their favor. Likewise, the timing of the trades matters. If they buy and hold the commodity, then sell it immediately upon funds clearing, then it is substantively different from taking the buyer&#x27;s funds first, then selling. The former is more akin to selling a commodity they own. The latter is brokering the transaction with the buyer&#x27;s funds and is dangerously close to holding deposits (if only for a brief time). If you think there is no material difference, you&#x27;re wrong. In fact, part of the difference is in what you&#x27;ve been demomizing them for: that is, the fact that Coinbase is taking on the risk in the former scenario.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think you can make the statements you&#x27;re making so definitively, nor do I think you should assume that you have thought this through more carefully than those who are running the company.",1387494091

6938600,comment,6931457,6933588,1,0,paveldurov,,,"abcd_f, I&#x27;m not part of the Telegram team, nor am I a cryptographer. However, I do support these guys, and for the last 3 days I saw the Telegram team diligently reply tech questions in Twitter, HN and blogs. I saw them collect questions from security experts and put up FAQs based on them <a href=\"http://core.telegram.org/techfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://core.telegram.org/techfaq</a> or <a href=\"http://core.telegram.org/contestfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://core.telegram.org/contestfaq</a> as well as update the obscure parts of their documentation.<p>>> Perhaps consider offering an alternative crypto suite based on standard protocols? In parallel with what you have. Just reuse an existing crypto framework and redo transport layer to your needs.<p>Again, I am not cryptographer. But as a person who wants his data to be secure I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with different teams trying different approaches. I 100% agree that people crave a good encrypted communication system, but I&#x27;m not sure it can be achieved in a world where everybody uses similar methods. What if some of the common &quot;best practices&quot; are intentionally promoted in the crypto-community as the best ones <i>exactly</i> because they contain flaws and backdoors?<p>And before you ask me to get real I would like to give you a perfect example of something that could be just that.<p>The Telegram team was criticized by some NH critics for their custom auth key exchange protocol. People asked – why take a random value from server and a random value from client and combine both with a creepy function? Why not, e.g., just generate a random value on the client and use RSA instead? Well, the answer is simple – the Telegram guys did not trust that the random value generated on the client-side was really random.<p>In August 2013 it turned out that their custom approach to protocol enabled Telegram to stay more secure when multiple other secure apps using more conventional solutions were hacked (<a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2013/08/some-secureran...</a>). Many Bitcoin apps were cracked and people lost money, Open Whisper Systems (I noticed these guys are aggressively promoted here in the NH community as the epitome of best security) had to hasten to patch their RedPhone app to avoid that vulnerability.<p>So I&#x27;m kind of suspicious when I see strong pressure to enforce the use of common techniques and get rid of uncommon ones just because they are uncommon. I think the Telegram guys have the right to choose their own path, and I&#x27;m sure our society will only benefit from it.<p>Of course, building custom solutions is no easy task and requires a lot of effort. But I&#x27;ve seen some of the Telegram guys (yes, the &quot;6 ACM champions&quot;) create things that I&#x27;d thought were impossible. Maybe I am wrong in putting my trust in their abilities, and I will be fined $200K+ for my naivete. However, I am willing to continue financing such contests, and I do hope that eventually we&#x27;ll all get something much more valuable than $200K.",1387494039

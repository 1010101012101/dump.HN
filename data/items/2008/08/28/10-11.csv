I didn't say that no-one will develop software for free, I said that <i>I</i> don't do it, and that I suspect that I'm far from unique.<p>Besides, if you look, you'll discover that many of the developers on those projects are getting paid for it, one way or another.",1219921042

The new selector engine will make it easier to write stuff, or the code will run faster?<p>That's been what's holding me back - I'm worried it'll be slower to run on browsers (especially old ones on old computers) then code written to do just what it needs to and no more.",1219920678

Not sure if it would be possible to convert these contacts into contracts (I rejected for other reasons, like location), as my Erlang experience amounts to doing a couple of projecteuler exercises. Just saying that recruiters are not only looking for Java developers.",1219920671

289001,comment,288894,288966,0,0,apgwoz,,,"I'd recommend jQuery, not just because of this library but because it really is worth using. Their motto ""The Write less, Do More..."" really holds true. Plus, it's fast, and will be even faster with John Resig integrates his new selector engine into the base jQuery.<p>Edit: I should have mentioned the other fact that jQuery aims to be compatible with other libraries such as Prototype by allowing you to change how it's used. I've never used it personally, but it might be helpful for you if you're adopting jQuery after having used another library for a while.",1219920368

Control is ownership (or a close cousin).<p>That's why internet music taxes & whatnot are ridiculous. That doesn't restore ownership. Just money.",1219919204

8526671,comment,8524256,8524579,0,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"> People that need to edit complex spreadsheets, compose scores for films, analyze genomes, and render 3d effects need real computers. As a developer this kind of customer is in many ways a better customer to serve than a teen snapping selfies on a phone.<p>This is true, but the point is that this is now a very small (and very rapidly shrinking) fraction of what constitutes &quot;computing&quot;.<p>Digital photography - used to involve a PC, doesn&#x27;t need to now. Casual video editing (which lets remember is the vast majority of video editing) - used to involve a PC, doesn&#x27;t need to now. E-mail and electronic communications - used to involve a PC, doesn&#x27;t need to now. Basic productivity/note taking/sorting/keeping - used to... you get the picture.<p>It&#x27;s not just that SmartPhones/tablets are replacing some PC tasks, it&#x27;s that there is a whole new swath of users for whom what might previously have been thought of as computing has nothing to do with a PC.<p>Think of it in terms of shooting video. 40 years ago if you were shooting video there would be a good chance you were some sort of professional (or at the very least an enthusiastic amateur). Now, if you&#x27;re shooting video, you&#x27;re probably just a regular person. That doesn&#x27;t mean that Smartphones have changed what professionals do or use, but it does mean that professionals are a very small fraction of the video now being shot.<p>The PC is the same, it&#x27;s still there and still needed, it&#x27;s just shrinking in terms of it&#x27;s proportion of what&#x27;s being done.",1414583811

8526669,comment,8518903,8526475,0,0,kibwen,,,"Inveterate Rustacean here, and I agree with this. We need to carefully clarify the sort of safety that Rust provides in order to avoid misleading people.<p>Improperly implemented `unsafe` blocks can cause crashes. APIs that don&#x27;t properly isolate unsafe interfaces can cause crashes. Bugs in the compiler, bugs in LLVM, and unforeseen unsoundness in the type system can cause crashes. So instead of saying &quot;Rust makes crashes impossible&quot;, I&#x27;m starting to prefer &quot;If you write only safe code, any crashes that occur are not your fault&quot;. A bit less comforting, but still a best-in-class guarantee for a bare-metal language (not to mention that the former claim is impossible in <i>any</i> language).<p>Furthermore, I think it&#x27;s important to express to people the true role of `unsafe` blocks, which are not so much &quot;Rust without safety&quot; as they are &quot;reified inline C code with a bit more safety&quot;. Rust without `unsafe` blocks <i>could</i> exist, but it would require an enormous amount of FFI and/or much more machinery baked into the compiler itself.",1414583746

The current policies on endangered species, as described in the article, seem to prohibit this.  Such policies are simply evil and broken - either by design or accident - and they should be changed, otherwise they simply facilitate extinction of such species.<p>There is no reason why Kew gardens should be prohibited from selling the seeds/saplings to any interested collector at a price appropriate to the rarity and the limited supply.

It derives from the mobile Win 8 desktop which is made more suitable for PCs so that people can use office and spreadsheets and other classic software in the traditional Win 7 way. But you can do many of these things right now on Android devices. For instance, gaming and office:<p><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehub&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft....</a><p>Both &quot;static&quot; and mobile desktops are continually merging together. Soon we will have mobile desktops which can turn into PC desktops instantly by just plugging the device into a docking station which is connected with a large display, keyboard, and mouse.<p>So when we define &quot;desktop&quot; as the sum of all traditional desktop applications then Android has really overthrown all other OS. The current office versions of Android are yet just not as convenient as PC desktop versions. Soon it will make no difference if you write your letters on a PC or on a mobile device with docking station. Of course this doesn&#x27;t count for productivity software (software engineering, CAD etc.) which still requires a lot of PC horse power.",1414583090

8526517,comment,8525044,8525805,0,0,PeterisP,,,"That re-post of a re-post of an Guardian article about a study seems to have mutated to a point of becoming untrue.<p>The study claims, among other things, that the freighters create a lot of sulphur emisions, and that the EU has currently cleaned up car requirements so that they don&#x27;t emit much sulphur in exhaust - thus, 15 largest freighters emit as much SOx as all the cars. It assumes that world&#x27;s cars fit EU emission standards, which is false, and posting in this context seems to assume that the <i>sulphur</i> oxides cause global problems, which is also false - the bad effects of SOx pollution are rather localized, and if we can replace 1 unit of SOx in the middle of a city with 2 units of SOx in the middle of an ocean, then I&#x27;d treat that as good thing.<p>A more appropriate citation (from the same original article, actually) is the following - it still shows some space for improvement, but is significantly diffferent than the untrue alarmist claim in the parent post.<p>&quot;Shipping is responsible for 18-30% of all the world&#x27;s nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution and 9% of the global sulphur oxide (SOx) pollution.&quot;",1414580737

Most operating systems provide two ways to identify key presses, let&#x27;s call them &quot;key codes&quot; and &quot;char codes&quot;.  So the char codes on a French layout are QDSZ instead of WASD but the key codes are the same, and the keys are in the same physical location so it doesn&#x27;t matter.  The only difficult part is figuring out how to present key codes back to the user.",1414580523

Even something like browsing the web is pretty much impossible, navigation is awkward, keyboard is rubbish and the speed is terrible. That being said I think there&#x27;s only a few of us that forgo smart phones and tables for a laptop or even desktop PC.<p>Office workers however are most likely not going to swap out their PC in the foreseeable future, in terms of speed and usability their are still way ahead of any mobile device (laptops excluded of cause).<p>Yes, mobile is just as important, if not more, that PCs in some industries. If you do online commerce, entertainment and consumer facing services ignoring mobile would be foolish. For other industries you can safely ignore mobile for now.",1414580485

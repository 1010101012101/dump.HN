If you're racing on tidal rivers near the coast, where most of our regattas were, the current varies widely throughout the day.  Say it's a 5k head-race starting upstream and coming down towards the sea.  At high and low tide you're essentially racing with no (or very little) current - much like a lake.  When the tide is coming in, you'd be racing against it and a 5k race can take 20 or more minutes.  If you're lucky and your race heat starts when the tide is going out, that same race will take 15 or less minutes.",1258854345

We do not have 2 pedals one saying ""horse power"" and one saying ""torque"".<p>Increasing the torque of an engine at a particular RPM is the same as increasing the power output at the same RPM.\nIf you have experience with a stick shift, you notice that we shift to a lower gear to go uphill. We are simply changing the gear ratio. Now why do we do that? We want to make sure that all the hard work the engine is doing is transformed into something that moves us up the hill. If we do not lower the gear ratio, the tire will skid and some of that power will be transformed into heat and go useless (besides the real possibility of skidding into this side of the valley!) .<p>So we are not trading horse power for torque, rather we are making sure that we get all the power to convert into torque by using a low gear ratio. power --> torque ---> uphill. The thing that is causing the confusion is the low gear ratio, which has to do with Friction that the tire has with the road. Friction is the crucial component that transforms engine power capacity into torque. That's why we have treads in the tire. That is one of the reasons Army tanks and Bulldozers have continuous tracks, to increase friction.",1258854288

Let's also ignore the fact that many oil lobbyists are now for a climate pact so that they can make billions off the trade of carbon credits.  Don't you see an issue with the underlying substance of the emails if they turn out to be true?<p>I find it remarkable that there are so many people here who would argue against accountability - especially when public funding and the public interest is involved (per your previous comment, accountability and transparency isn't just for banks).  If these emails turn out to be true, if anything this shows that these scientists are not disinterested empiricists but have activist agendas.  But this also doesn't mean that they aren't right.  The issue could be solved by publishing their data sets and code for their models for public scrutiny and yet they do not - despite being largely publicly funded.  Do you not see a problem with this?",1258851622

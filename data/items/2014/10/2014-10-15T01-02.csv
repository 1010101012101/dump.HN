And nnethercote still blogs about major MemShrink occurrences.<p>And in the post marked &quot;The Final Progress Report&quot; I said this:<p>> I was due to write a MemShrink progress report today, but I’ve decided that after almost 2.5 years, my reserves of enthusiasm for these regular reports has been exhausted.  Sorry! I do still plan to write posts when significant fixes relating to memory consumption are made.  (For example, when generational GC lands, you’ll hear about it here.)  I will also continue to periodically update the MemShrink “big ticket items” list.  And MemShrink meetings will continue, so MemShrink-tagged bugs will still be triaged.  And for those of you who read the weekly Platform meeting notes, I will continue to write MemShrink updates there.

But almost all of the probiotics on the market don&#x27;t contain any bacteroidetes. Most have lactobacillus (which is technically a firmicutes, but considered a &quot;good firmicutes&quot; I guess, and is used to make yoghurt) or bifidobacterium (like Align) which is in a completely separate family (Actinobacteria). When I saw this product on a mailing list a couple days ago, I purchased it because it was exactly what I had been looking for. So I think this has potential for informed early adopters.<p>There are some people that can read articles on the Internet from google searches and realize that they aren&#x27;t getting the whole picture because they are obviously from the low-quality content-farmed stuff that google ranks highly on health search results, and I think this is appealing to them (us). Now, it&#x27;s yet to be seen whether it&#x27;s a winning move to provide clear, logical information grounded in science vs. tooting the bullshit horn that we see in naturalistic health circles.<p>I definitely agree that they could have more marketable messaging, but I would expect that they&#x27;ll be able to develop better marketing presence by gradually accumulating pagerank, becoming well-known in serious health circles, and maybe some affiliate marketing and the like. But all that takes time and this is right out of the gate. Their core value proposition is much better than competing companies, in my opinion.",1413337807

It&#x27;s possible that the human brain isn&#x27;t very <i>efficient</i> at intelligence alone - there&#x27;s many survival functions and the historical path evolution happened to take. (as harder evidence, I also read of a guy with almost no brain, just a few millimeters coating the skull, who had normal college IQ...)<p>But I was really adding my own tangent, a thought I had long ago: assuming intelligence <i>can</i> be simulated by an algorithm, it can be done now, because of turing machine equivalence (provided we have sufficient memory). If it used too much memory, it seems likely we could still run a cut-down version, or some aspect of it. [BTW: Arguably, if a mathematical model of consciousness exists, with variations for personality, knowledge, present state of mind etc, all of them are virtually conscious and feeling at all times - just frozen in stasis at the moment].<p>Historically, one barrier to new algorithms is that practical people just don&#x27;t entertain algorithms that are computationally infeasibile on present hardware.

Even though I had puss nodules on the very spot (my left tonsil) I felt everything was coming from, I was not prescribed antibiotics because the strep test came back negative.<p>note, these are two severe cases where I was REALLY sick and not getting better.  not only did doctors not prescribe antibiotics for these, but for all general colds and flues that i have ever had - I have never received that as a prescription.  they simply will not do it.<p>lucky for me, I had a plane jane penicillin script that was never taken.  within an hour of taking it, the sore throat abated as did the fever.  by the next morning, I was nearly better.  maybe coincidence, but i seriously doubt it.<p>they love to fear monger about over prescribing antibiotics, about creating super bugs, etc.  but the truth is, they do help.  even with viruses, because quite often these diseases wreck your immune system allowing  many other things to take hold.  for instance, bacterial ear infections are quite common enough with these types of infections and antibiotics totally prevents them - and the good possibility of hearing loss.<p>however, evidenced based medicine is often set up to prove whatever agenda they want to pass.  a few people with reduced hearing is inconsequential to their idea of a greater good.  especially in the agenda to reduce people receiving antibiotics - even when evidence has shown that the amount of antibiotics farm animals are given probably over shadows any lack of antibiotics given to sick humans trying to get better.",1413336522

Similarly, the angle of attack went beyond the range the designers had anticipated, and the computer assumed that it was a bad reading. But it kept going, because it had to. In a car, if there&#x27;s a bad reading, it can again just go straight to &quot;pull over and stop&quot;.<p>Big failures will always mean big problems, but what&#x27;s striking about AF447 is that it was such <i>small</i> failures. And when it comes to small failures, I think a car is in a much better position to deal with it because it can just cut the gordian knot.",1413336404

Yet our review of the literature reveals that aspects of relationships that emerge only after two people meet and get to know each other — things like communication patterns, problem-solving tendencies and sexual compatibility — are crucial for predicting the success or failure of relationships. For example, study after study has shown that the way that couples discuss and attempt to resolve disagreements predicts their future satisfaction and whether or not the relationship is likely to dissolve.<p>>the information that they do collect — about individual characteristics — accounts for only a tiny slice of what makes two people suited for a long-term relationship.<p>>According to a 2008 meta-analysis of 313 studies, similarity on personality traits and attitudes had no effect on relationship well-being in established relationships. In addition, a 2010 study of more than 23,000 married couples showed that similarity on the major dimensions of personality (e.g., neuroticism, impulsivity, extroversion) accounted for a mere 0.5 percent of how satisfied spouses were with their marriages — leaving the other 99.5 percent to other factors.<p>Sure it will get you to meet singles, but there probably isn&#x27;t anything special about it other than that.

It is possible given sufficient time Ebola will mutate in ways that generate those features. It is also possible, given sufficient time, Ebola will mutate into flesh-eating flying monkeys (admittedly, this is marginally less likely than becoming airborne.)<p>Viruses--parasite and pathogens generally-are <i>incredibly</i> narrowly adapted to their preferred mode of attack. They have to be, because the chinks in the host&#x27;s immune system are almost by definition incredibly narrow. If they weren&#x27;t the host species would not have survived.<p>This gives pathogens and parasites very little room to maneuver. They can&#x27;t just arbitrarily bolt on new capabilities. They have relatively little genetic material to work with: 19 kilobases in the case of Ebola, which is less than the coding length of the majority of human genes (which can run comfortably into the hundreds of kilobases).<p>So think of Ebola like an evil eight-bit micro-controller. It&#x27;s only got 256 bytes to work with. It has been carefully programmed with a tiny attack program that depends on a very specific weakness in the target system that requires it be plugged into a USB port controlled by a particular chipset rev from a particular manufacturer. The claim &quot;it might go airborne&quot; is equivalent to the claim that such a chip, under millions of random mutations, might be able to infect systems via network ports <i>while remaining the same in every other respect</i>.<p>This is not (provably) impossible, but it is of such low probability that I&#x27;m pretty sure anyone concerned about it should be in a state of panic regarding cows, coconuts, coronal mass ejections, and other far-more-probable causes of death if they want to make any claims to intellectual consistency.",1413335976

It&#x27;s an unlimited resource sink, but it&#x27;s a) what you have to do lest you get outcompeted by others, and b) profitable for those who facilitate advertising.<p>Weixiyen is also right that this &quot;growth hack&quot; is effective, but remember that &quot;growth hacking&quot; is mostly a fancy term for spamming / abusing trust. Every new way to trick people into buying something will work for a while, until everyone else starts doing the same and the ROI drops to zero.<p>Once upon a time, a pop-up banner was <i>the</i> clever growth hacking trick. As HN&#x27;s idlewords tells the story,<p>&quot;One of the first banner ads had a click-through rate of 78%. That&#x27;s mind-boggling. Do you know what two words were on that banner ad?<p>&quot;Shop Naked!&quot; CLICK!<p>But banner ads turned out to be like poison ivy. People clicked them once, and learned never to touch them again. The industry collapsed in a flurry of pop-overs, pop-unders, and shame.&quot;<p><a href=""http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm</a>",1413335002

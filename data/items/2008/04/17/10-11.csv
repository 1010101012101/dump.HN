He's the guy who wrote ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and now works at Pixar on the next Toy Story.<p>The most interesting thing he said about Pixar was how they have a rigorous testing process where they go through years of test, edit, shoot (generate) iterations.  It sounded like agile development applied to movie making, which is only possible because Pixar does animation and reshoots are only limited by money.  Real-life shoots aren't as amenable to long iterative shooting schedules because actors move on to other gigs or physically change.<p>""[Jobs] realized that when people run into each other, when they make eye contact, things happen. So he made it impossible for you not to run into the rest of the company.""<p>There was a similar design criterion for the Clark Center (<a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/home/welcome/campus/clark.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/home/welcome/campus/clark.html</a>).  The only staircases are wide ones on the outside that maximize chances of people running into each other, as does the single restroom per section.  And then there's the coffee shop on the 3rd floor.<p>Software developers, on the other hand, might want an opposite environment so they don't get distracted with random encounters.",1208429758
166222,comment,163552,163552,0,0,msk,,,"this is a great post.  It rings so true.  We are a nearly ten year old technology firm that has spent years of laser light focus on our product.  The venture industry is a herd that cannot understand innovation if their lives depended on it and seem to care more about the politics of the venture world rather than spending time to learn beyond the ridiculous 'elevator pitch'.  God forbid you say your technology is a major innovation and will change an industry - I think they all would rather have a weather widget on Facebook than actually shape an industry.  I sometimes wonder if VCs are so drawn to the Midas 8 from Google (which is 10 years old and getting dusty up at the top) that they emulate the investment strategy of this lucky few rather than finding their own path. Our company is now talking with Wall Street firms about raising $100 to $200 Million over the next few months and smart money is betting we have created a $50 Billion industry that never existed before.  We find it comical as the street has embraced our company while the VC community continues to chase the ""me-toos"" while talking the talk.",1208429728

Tags are nice, but I'd really like real folders too.<p>Also, you end up with basically two different inboxes: your real inbox, and the ""All Mail"" folder. You have to delete or mark messages in both places (I think there's supposed to be some sort of synchronization, but it's not obvious)",1208426704
166209,comment,166171,166171,0,0,edw519,,,"""Arenâ€™t There Real Problems To Solve?""<p>I have always spent a lot of my time in small or midsize companies (10 to 200 employees), and I can assure you the answer is ABSOLUTELY.<p>These are hard working people who are in a different world than most of the readers here.  They don't facebook, twitter, or IM at work.  But they are unbelieveably busy trying to get things done while depending upon software and systems that most of us here would laugh at.<p>Many of them don't have time to get to all their emails and voice mails.  They have to make snap decisions all day long without enough information because their software just doesn't give them what they need easily enough.  They have constant problems with interpersonal communication, instruction, and understanding.<p>Just a sample of what I've witnessed in the past 3 weeks:<p>- We need multiple ""ship to"" addresses for this institutional customer.  The software doesn't support it.<p>- The exchange server is down.<p>- We need multiple prices for the same item, depending on the scenario.  The shopping cart won't allow it.<p>- 300 ""smart part numbers"" were configured incorrectly because no one gave Jane the correct Vendor Codes last week.  But now, we have orders, inventory, and history for those items, so the software won't let us change or delete them.<p>- The exchange server is down.<p>- No one remembered to reset the warehouse server last night, so everything came in today with the wrong date.<p>- The new stockroom printer doesn't support HP PCL, so the bar code labels are all wrong.<p>- We think that $90,000 order acknowledgement from XYZ Company was deleted by the spam filter, but we're not sure.<p>- There was a bad pointer in the UPS data base last Tuesday, so 72 packages all went to the same customer in Duluth.<p>- The wrong 800 number is being printed on our invoices.  Our customers are calling a sex hotline.<p>- The exchange server is down.<p>These are not jokes.  I see them all the time.  And while we regale all the cool stuff WE are doing, I can honestly say that the situation in many small businesses hasn't improved all that much.  And there are 7 million of them.  They need help.<p>The good news?  This is a fantastic opportunity for those with our skills and technology.<p>Yes, there are plenty of real problems to solve.  Stay tuned.",1208426613

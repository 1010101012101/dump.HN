Short selling is actually ruining the ability of financial institutions that aren't even exposed to the mortgage problems (or are minimally so) to get the inflow of credit they need. Or so the argument goes.<p>Again, I'm not an economist, so I don't have a strong opinion here. What I do know is that people who know a hell of a lot more than me (or probably anyone who posts here) are making these decisions, so dismissing them based on some generalized knowledge (i.e. short selling is bad because my econ 101 textbook said so) seems childish.<p>That's why I was asking the original commenter if, perhaps, he knew enough about economics to have an informed opinion. For all I know, he has a PhD in it.",1221865584

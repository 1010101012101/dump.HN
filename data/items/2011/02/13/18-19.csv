I'm going to assume you're a single male between the age of 25 and 35.<p>The right ideas will slowly come to you, but getting some perspective is essential and that's not going to come from sitting in your apartment staring at your laptop. The two things I suggest are:<p>* Exercise. Mens sana in corpore sano. Lift some weights. Run, cycle. Anything. Be yourself, only better (as seen on a t-shirt). You will not believe how much regular exercise will change your state of mind.<p>* Travel. Get out of town. Get out of your hole. Get some perspective. Even if you just go to stay with some relatives in another city for a few weeks. If you can afford the flights, go somewhere warm and cheap and bask in the sun like a lizard. Meet some strangers. Make friends. Talk to girls. Read, eat, drink.<p>I wish you the best of luck, and please let us know how you get on.<p>Edit: I also really, really recommend reading Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. It will definitely help shape your thoughts, and it's a very quick read.",1297623530

Once you've seen the convergence first hand for particular values of x, the proof of its general convergence immediately suggests itself. But if you've only seen the abstract proof, you would probably never have realized that the e^x power series has extremely initial poor convergence for negative x.

2213417,story,,,89,112,PostBurnout,"Ask HN: Burned out.  How can I make the most of a sabbatical leave?",,"I was in denial about burnout for a long time, thinking that it was something that I just have to push myself through, and everything would be okay when it's over.  But I recently read the description from jacquesm (http://jacquesmattheij.com/Are+you+suffering+from+burn-out) and it hit me hard. I'm in a state of shock over how much control I've ceded to this madness.  Now the work is winding down, many co-workers have left for greener pastures, and my productivity is asymptotically approaching zero.<p>I've just asked my boss for a 1-year sabbatical, but I haven't chosen a start date for it, and I'm already suffering from analysis paralysis over what to do.  I'm not ready for a new job or project -- I'm in no shape to work.  I could travel, but my problems will just follow me around the world.  I could volunteer, but I'm so emotionally empty that there's no heart for me to pour anywhere.  I could do anything... and yet I'm somehow mentally and physically exhausted from doing little more than clock-watching and perfunctory bullshit (I wasn't this way before and can't believe that I've descended to this).<p>I don't have any goals or plans (or if I ever did, I've long since forgotten them).  The perfect opportunity could be staring me in the face and I wouldn't notice it, or I'd talk myself out of it for fear of screwing it up.<p>Meanwhile, I've been self-medicating with classical music, long walks along the beach, science fiction novels, Internet addiction, and LOTS of sleep (9+ hours/day).  It numbs the pain a bit, but otherwise doesn't seem to be helping.<p>Even more disturbing is that lately I've noticed myself engaging in perverse escape fantasies about what I might do (and then I'd catch myself and have a <i>Who are you kidding?!</i> moment):<p>- I'd ride my bike across the continent from Vancouver to Halifax (<i>I don't own a bicycle and haven't ridden one in years</i>)<p>- I'd travel to Antarctica and cuddle with penguins (<i>I'm complaining about the unbearable winter cold in Southern California</i>)<p>- I'd join a grassroots protest movement and bring down oppressive regimes (<i>I'm too scared even to donate to Wikileaks</i>)<p>- I'd dedicate myself to volunteer work in the places of the world most in need of help (<i>I don't even pick up the litter I see on the street, and my lifetime charitable contributions total to less than US $1000</i>)<p>- I'd earn a PhD, publish papers in prestigious journals, and achieve a research breakthrough (<i>I flunked a couple of classes during college and probably survived my M.S. due to grade inflation</i>)<p>- I'd found a startup, make products and services that people love, build überscale infrastructure using ultracool tech, and cash out for a fortune (<i>I can't even refactor this putrid pile of Java in front of me</i>)<p>- I'd become a virtuoso musician, competitive athlete, bestselling author, award-winning chef, whatever (<i>I've spent the last 10 years working to become a better programmer and I still suck</i>)<p>- I'd disappear into some misty mountain in a remote part of the world and live out my days as an ascetic hermit (<i>I'm here on HN begging for advice like a whiny, attention-seeking brat</i>)<p>And so I stop.  These aren't real goals; I recognize them as daydreaming.  I'm already defeated before I've even begun.<p>What I think I need is some time to do some serious soul-searching, and I doubt that a mere change of employment or environment is sufficient, since true change has to come from within.  But anything more specific than that and I'm lost.<p>What I fear is that I might just be fundamentally lazy, and my lack of a plan will doom me to failure, whereupon I'll spend the rest of my life as damaged goods, unmotivated, unproductive, unemployable, unwanted and useless.<p>I'm not looking for sympathy. I just hope someone can kick some sense into me, help me see the light, and make best use of my time to recover.",1297622423

Once a computer is capable of some calculation, students will never need to have to do it by themselves again. However, they will still need to know how to interact with that calculation and understand the variables/relationships in order to set up the calculation.<p><i>Where do you draw the line?</i><p>Instead of just one line, you have to draw two lines. One would be on the more elementary end of the spectrum. Students have to learn the rudimentary basic calculations (or memorization) in order to function well in everyday life and higher levels of education. Simple addition, subtract, division, multiplication, estimation, understanding of relationships would be necessary. As much as I adore algebra, it could be left to the computer. Therefore the first line would be drawn at a point where the material does not show up in everyday scenarios.<p>The next line would be drawn at the opposite end of the spectrum where humans need to come in and do the higher orders of thinking. Given the right software, students would be able to visualize and understand the basics of the calculations and their relationships without actually calculating them. They would therefore be able to use computers in more applied problems - ones that they would be confronted in their careers later on in life. A few experiments could be conducted to find exactly where this line would be drawn. It would be at the point where humans do the smallest amount of calculation work while still having a solid understanding. Computers may be able to work past this line, but they would end up assisting the students to the point where the students lose the understanding of the concepts.<p>If the US and other countries truly put the time, money, and effort into this reform, I'm sure they could be quite successful.<p>However, another tricky thing to think about would be transitioning into this new and reformed type of education...",1297622238

Being able to drive a 44780 LCD, read a rotary encoder, and do basic serial I/O in the same hobbyist project were well out of the grasp of the common hobbyist in the late 90's, but the BS2 made all those things possible for $50.<p>Arduino hasn't really set the bar that high, it's the next/current evolution of something that has been going on ever since the commercialization of the first NP junction.<p>Like the Stamps before it, the Arduino is a neat prototyping device, but not something you can build a 'product' around with any great scale beyond a hobbyist market. The biggest difference in that in its heyday the Stamp didn't have the full power of the Internet to make people aware of them. You mostly had usenet or publications like Nuts N Volts to expose people to the possibilities of simple micros. The Arduino has gotten great exposure because of the Internet, but in the grand scheme of things hasn't really done all THAT much. The article on Make references 100000-150000 Arduinos sold. Maxim has given away more PICs than that as free samples.<p>Sure, the Arduino is neat and cool, but the fawning over it you see on sites like Make heavily skews reality.  30 years ago if we had the Internet this blog post would have been ""Why the 555 won and why it's here to stay""",1297620962

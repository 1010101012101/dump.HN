So far most things I did were dependent on somebody controlling the market. With mobile games, there was the dependency on the mobile phone carriers and established games vendors, for example. Overall I was unhappy with that situation.<p>I haven't made the decision yet, because I only thought about the facebook aspect today.",1201523720

105491,comment,104919,105313,0,0,Tichy,,,"I was talking about the pregnancy itself. Btw., there are other costs for the mother besides missing a few weeks of work: there could be medical problems, the mother might even die. So it is still more costly to have babies for women than it is for men. I seem to remember that women also have a higher risk for infection through many STDs.<p>However, I think we might not disagree as much as you may think: of course, in theory, since the mind can control the body, it is conceivable to create any kind of culture. Maybe we could teach our children to only walk on legs and feet, so you could rightfully claim that ""walking upright is just a cultural thing"". The ""richer"" human societies are, the more wasteful cultural habits like that we could afford.<p>I am not sure that society can be reprogrammed in an arbitrary way, though. First of all, it still needs to survive, and it must be able to compete with other societies, even other animals. I think you have to take into consideration WHY culture evolved into it's current state - it has an evolutionary history. I read your statements as such that you think that it was a random whim of nature to give us our current culture. If you are convinced that men and women are equal, then there must have been a 50:50 chance for gender roles being exactly reversed. Do you agree thus far?<p>My claim is merely that it was not random, but that there was a bias due to the differences of men and women, which makes certain cultural habits more effective than others. As you say in your previous post, and I said somewhere else, inventions might tip the scales, and other cultural models could become viable.",1201522413
105490,comment,105470,105478,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I think that's right on the money! Asking your target users what they want. Maybe I could share a few things for what it's worth. Back then I wanted to build a Yelp! like site just for the sake of it. I was thinking that guys like me would benefit from it. To cut the long story short it didn't go so well. Anyways a couple of months before my failed attempt I built a simple to-do list application. My dad saw it and asked me what else does it do. To cut another long story short this simple to-do list evolved into a full fledged project management application that is aimed towards people who are in the same line of business as my father. It's feature set was built specifically by the recommendation of my users. And by God's grace I have four companies lined up in the trenches ready to buy my software :-). So yeah without a FGD (focus group discussion) my company wouldn't be where it is right now. I was constantly amazed by the difference between what I want as a user and what my target users want. So never underestimate a good FGD session or similar to my case several FGD sessions.",1201522238

105488,story,,,6,7,Tichy,"Ask YC: what to develop first, Facebook App or Website?",,"Thinking about my current project, I just realized that it doesn't do anything I couldn't do with facebook - I assume anything a social network can do, a facebook app can do. So I wonder if I should create the facebook app first, and only later create a standalone website for my service?<p>And I just realized that there is no way to compete with Facebook, at least not without adding my own ""Facebook Apps"" feature: no matter how many features I conceive for my SN, I will never be able to add features as fast as the plethora of Facebook Apps creators out there. My only hope is that, just like me, not everybody wants to be on facebook.",1201521852

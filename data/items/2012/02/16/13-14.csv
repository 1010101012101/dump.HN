Potentially the US ""authorities"" can take down your dot com domain (operated by Verisign), your hosting if in US, or maybe even prevent DNS resolutions to your domain inside the US (they can ask large ISPs to update their DNS servers). What you are left with is using a non dot com, non US hosting, and avoid having too much business from US customers. Then you might run into the same in Europe, etc. That does not sound like a good long term strategy.",1329400782

However, the timing wasn't right - hardware wasn't powerful enough and Orange/FT didn't have the balls or corporate DNA to establish something like the OMA.<p>At Orange (or probably any carrier) getting a device out the door was a clusterfuck.  You had to coordinate between the Device manufacturer (who never had any flexibility in their software schedule), the various operating companies who wanted phones in shop by Nov 1 for the Holiday or else, and various PM's running about trying to get features on the phone to help with their particular mandate (at the time it might have been music, IM, etc).<p>So yeah, anyone with half a technical clue could see that you could get shit done faster with a common OS.  WHat's amazing is that with a little bit of juice from Google and a crack engineering team from Rubin they managed to totally dominate the non IOS smartphone market in a couple of years.<p>People seem to have this odd view that Android is deficient because it doesn't have some IOS optimizations.  But look - if I told you to build something on one set of hardware and make it great that's 10x easier than building an open system.

To me it now looks like Android was just a stepping stone for Google to eventually become the doorway to the internet for a huge audience, something it couldn't achieve alone with Chromebooks. The privacy implications of using ChromeOS in this way are frightening. Say you log in with a Google account. Assuming you are like most people and don't read/know/care/understand about privacy options Google could theoretically have your web history, your email (GMail), viewing habits (Youtube), your documents (Google Docs), your social interactions (Google+), purchase history (Checkout) and now your location at all times (aGPS), contact list and call history. Now with Dart, NaCl and their Web Store they'll also be responsible for licencing you your games and applications. Assuming they will want all this (I have no doubt they will) they now have a new 'privacy' policy they can combine all this data. That's a kind of control and knowledge Microsoft hasn't even dared dream about. I'm not calling Google evil. No one is forcing users to do this and Google are not alone in doing this....",1329400259

For youporn, each video page is essentially static (maybe there are comments? Even if there are, I doubt they display a different set of comments to each /viewer/). So video pages are easy to cache, the database layout is simple, and sure there's some effort involved in scaling up but it's nowhere near as hard as e.g. tumblr's architecture that was featured recently (where every viewer sees a page with all the posts from everyone they're following, and so everyone's page is different)<p>/briefly worked at last.fm",1329397859

But if we take the literal definition of the root word (conspire) then every legislative act would fall into that far too broad category.<p>Conspiracy theory aside, you have to realize that no law ever gets passed, or even makes it to a full vote, unless multiple parties are successfully convinced that they, their constituents, and their campaign contributors will benefit from the proposed bill.<p>No muddying of the waters intended.

E.g. buy an item on eBay and sell it. Keep doing that over and over again until you figure out how to make a profit in the process.<p>- Sell your time (directly, not via a regular job). Almost everyone has something they're good at. Do that again and again until you're good at it, then see if you can sell someone else's time.",1329397743

Thanks for the tips  - I've farmed the image uploads out to merbs running in EC2 - there are some other long running (6+ second) tasks that users could perform frequently - I'll start to farm those out as well.",1200969122

101973,comment,101445,101487,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"Thanks - the 120K users is more likely the total number of users for the app - so chances are slim of them all using the site at once - but want to plan for the worst.  Might be putting together a license deal and just want to make sure that I don't bankrupt myself.<p>So - a metric might be 30 concurrent users for 4 mongrels - 
4 mongrels per EC2 server.<p>120 CCU would be 16 mongrels on 4 EC2 servers, etc.<p>Not that I'd use EC2 - just a convenient constant - load balancing would be tricky.",1200968964

Looks a little weird with just one button.<p>The system looks useful.  Not sure if I'd want people to contact me after searching for programmers.  You could make sure that the example tag search (""E.g.: Chinese food caterer"") returns an entry or that it fits with your targeted audience (""E.g.: PHP programmer"").",1200968555

2. a 15 slide business plan 
3. one other person that will dedicate him/herself on the level that you are planning.<p>You will have a newfound appreciation for stability if you do your own company no matter what the economy looks like.",1200967941

[1]  Furthermore, the only people with any real motivation to input data are those that want to game the system.  How about this as an alternative version 1: a facebook or linkedin app that lets you request a recommendation for a caterer, mechanic, whatever, from your friends.  That's useful immediately, and you can aggregate responses.<p>Also, the people giving me the thumbs-up were beggin for a hurtin.<p>[1] The current version of your site doesn't care about location, which makes it look less empty but be less useful.",1200967904

Is it merely the social maladjustment?<p>We males tend to adjust our behaviors based on what women find sexy, which is partially why universities used to be male only.  Geekiness correlates with good intellectual work, but as mentioned, women don't like it.<p>Which also makes me think that the key to guiding society is by defining what women find sexy.",1200967772

One thing you could try, if you're having a tough time with the sheer amount of things to learn out there, is to try to find a project to work on that's going to apply some external pressure on you to solve problems and learn new things. That way, you can sort of chip away at things.",1200967550

In the alpha version it does not go that far yet, that's the idea though.<p>I agree that there has to be a good way to prevent how the system can be gamed. We are building those into our design, just haven't had the time to totally add it into the front yet.<p>Good suggestions. Thanks.",1200967349

8635993,comment,8634357,8634357,0,0,thirdsun,,,"> “The idea that DJs are just picking songs because they like  them is so antiquated,” says Radha Subramanyam, the executive vice president of insights, research, and analytics at iHeartMedia<p>-<p>I imagine that hardly anyone here listens to traditional radio anymore, which makes a lot of sense to me as I&#x27;m very particular and selective about my music listening habits too and rarely trust any recommendations.<p>However recently I started listening to NTS Radio rather frequently. In contrast to the quote above NTS shows are very much made of songs the DJ likes - that is all the qualification they need. No agenda, no hype, no ratings. Every show owner is free to come up with his very own selection, from all genres. Of course it means you have to find the right show for your taste - however if you do it&#x27;s rather satisfying - I&#x27;ve been able to dig up a ton of rarely known soul gems on &quot;The Do You Breakfast Show&quot;: <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/tag/the-do-you-breakfast-show/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mixcloud.com/tag/the-do-you-breakfast-show/</a><p>The whole idea and philosophy behind NTS Radio is very appealing, worth a read and a fresh contrast to the data-driven selection process described in the article: <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/the-rise-and-rise-of-nts-radio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dummymag.com/features/the-rise-and-rise-of-nts-ra...</a>",1416495535

8635990,comment,8635466,8635466,0,0,protonfish,,,"The fact that we are discussing this generically as <i>UI Design</i> shows the immaturity of the concept. I can see at least two clear ideas needed to discuss this in a more detailed and rational manner.<p>1. We need to clearly separate the difference between UI design and UI decoration. Design should be driven by user testing that measures speed and rate of completion of tasks. If every feature of the latest UI is not measured to be a quantitative increase, then it is not a design improvement. Decoration is about being fashionable and has nothing to do with usable, efficient, elegant UI. I see no reason they cannot exist side by side, but today the prevailing policy seems to be that decorating UI in a trendy fashion trumps usability.<p>2. There needs to be thought about the adoption and transition of users from an old interface to a new one. Right now the philosophy seems to be &quot;Stop whining and suck it up - our designers are smarter than you.&quot; This is not reasonable or professional. New designs should be measured not just for usability of new users, but also against users that are used to the previous interface. There are probably many techniques to improve the user experience of UI upgrades but we&#x27;ll never discover them until we recognize that it is important and spend some time and effort studying this phenomenon.",1416495500

Part of that is due to having to re-learn the UI. And I wouldn&#x27;t mind this if there was actually a benefit, but often times I can&#x27;t find it no matter how long I think about it.

The amount of times I&#x27;ve opened the phone app instead of unlocking the phone is becoming obscene. I often have my phone landscape while using it as a mini-tablet and in that orientation it&#x27;s easy to do. Perhaps I&#x27;m paranoid but I think the screen now locks faster than it used to and I haven&#x27;t been able to find the setting to slow it down yet, which exacerbates the problem, when you&#x27;re lounging and intermittently transferring your attention between tv and internet browsing.<p>And the new calendar app only allows you to see 6 hours at a time, so you can&#x27;t get an overview of your day.<p>The settings app requires some sort of double swipe down that&#x27;s just plain awkward. Auto-brightness has been got rid of so often you&#x27;re constantly fighting the brightness of your phone at night.<p>The new notification have to be double tapped, which again is awkward, especially as they register the first tap and then &quot;helpfully&quot; tell you to make a 2nd one. But the first tap is behind a button press of the lock screen so it&#x27;s actually a triple press.<p>I&#x27;m also slightly perplexed as to the home button icon change, to a circle of all things. It actually offends me a bit, it&#x27;s so tiny and yet completely devoid of meaning. It&#x27;s different for Apple&#x27;s circle button as that was a real button, Google&#x27;s tiny circle just kinda floats there. And the &quot;back&quot; triangle changes orientation for no discernible reason other than the designer obviously wanted to animate something.<p>The new phone app is strange, the buttons are too small, the volume of the button presses doesn&#x27;t turn down as you turn down the speaker volume.<p>And this is in a day and a half of use. It honestly feels like anyone testing it would have hit most of these issues. I suspect Google&#x27;s designers then turned round to the testers and said &quot;As designed. Material, you know. It&#x27;s just a new way&quot;, rather than admit they&#x27;d screwed up.<p>The worst part is, it&#x27;s not added anything.

Transitions exist to make it obvious what is happening: e.g. you minimize a window and it zooms into the taskbar/dock, as a visual reminder that it&#x27;s not gone, just stored there. This kind of thing is even more important with an unfamiliar interface.<p>Are the particular transitions he&#x27;s complaining about bad?

Teaching and society could both be bad.<p>My understanding, from this article and other reports, is that the percentage of teachers drawn from the top tier of graduates is dropping (top tier measured by GRE scores, grades, and rigor of the undergraduate program).  The top 10% of math majors, for instance, rarely become teachers.<p>I think the US is putting so much emphasis on a plan.  My take on it is if you draw your math teachers from the top echelons of math students, and provide support for learning to teach in a classroom, you really won&#x27;t need to micromanage the curriculum.  Sure, a general plan is a good thing, but at that point you can give the teachers pretty broad autonomy in the classroom.<p>Still, the problems you&#x27;ve described are extremely serious and could completely derail an education and life regardless of the talent and devotion of the teacher.

So validate the idea, talk to business owners, find out if it&#x27;s a pain point, would they pay for a SaaS to solve it. Then it&#x27;s about execution.<p>Pick something you can get an initial version up fast and get paying customers signed up and using it. Maybe a goal of 30 days to launch initial version get signups.<p>You don&#x27;t want to spend 6 to 12 months building X only to find out customers wanted Y or Z instead. So launch fast.<p>Then you can track how paying customers are using it, how often they log in, create/view X,Y,Z in the app. And you&#x27;ll have an idea if it&#x27;s providing value.<p>SaaS is a slow slog to gain customers so it will probably take 18 to 24 months to climb up to maintaining 200 subscribers.<p>Good luck.",1416492983

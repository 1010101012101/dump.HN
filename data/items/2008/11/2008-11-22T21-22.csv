373224,comment,373064,373064,0,0,bokonist,,,"Are the test scores you refer to based on learned skills, or on intelligence?  If the former, you could try giving the students a test like the Raven's Progressive Matrices.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices</a>  It's a test of intelligence that does not require the student to be able to read, know math, or possess any cultural knowledge.  It might be useful for finding bright students who were just not brought up in an environment that encouraged learning.<p>If that doesn't work, I suppose the thing to do is give the scholarship to the highest performing student who could not otherwise afford the tuition.",1227390854

I am reminded of one of the studies cited in Gladwell's Blink about how you can thin-slice (speedily evaluate relative merit) a person's abilities in pretty diverse fields (speed-dating, classroom teaching) with only a 10 (or so) second video of the person.<p>No test administered by classroom teachers can escape corruption, unless the teachers are themselves unaware of what constitutes a right answer.",1227390163

373210,comment,373064,373064,0,0,sachinag,,,"I've spent some time thinking about this - and you have a devil of a test issue.  You need a test that doesn't correlate with income, but that can be seen as fair and transparent.<p>You're better off doing an evaluation that has absolutely nothing to do with actual skills.  If you measured, say, reaction time, you'd end up with something that's just not likely to be correlated at all to income - just to innate ability and practice.  Assuming all the kids from all the income levels would practice the same amount and that families of wealth do not have higher reaction times, you're going to end up with ""winners"" that aren't limited to the high income.<p>Doing a test based on reaction time seems incredibly unfair - you're not looking for kids who are the most promising from the get go - but you're guaranteed to not just get the wealthy.  In the end, you'll be helping more kids who need the scholarship than you would be with an aptitude test.  Since that's the goal, this plan has a net benefit.  It's not perfect, and it's not pretty, and it's probably duplicitous, but you'll at least have a better outcome than you would with your existing tools.<p>Ideally, yes, you'd want to find a ""fair"" aptitude test that wasn't income-correlated, but that is going to be incredibly difficult to do.",1227388984

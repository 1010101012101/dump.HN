650777,comment,650437,650545,0,0,brl,,,"Young developers can be, and often are, highly productive but software development is more nuanced than just raw lines of code.  Sensible design is both very difficult and very important and I don't think anybody gets very good at it with less than 10 years of experience.<p>The first 100K lines or so are easy and somebody with talent who is fresh out of school is going to get to the finish line at least as fast as a 10 year veteran.  The real test is the next 100K lines of code which the experienced designer is going to breeze through while the novice is about to learn an important lesson: Writing large programs is much harder than writing small ones.",1244627897

In most industries, you're just beginning your career when you're in your early 30s</i><p>I wonder how much this is to do with the relative newness of programming as a profession. Medicine and law have had a very long time to develop systems to train the young, then identify and reward the knowledgable and talented. Perhaps in a few decades 20-something and 30-something programmers will be regarded in much the same way as their law and medicine practising counterparts.",1244627627

I worked on it and I still wish grievous bodily harm on those who use it for FAQs.<p>If I had my way, we'd throw away the current GWT implementation for a version that used unobtrusive JS and was a good netizen.

The very fact that you get the notice ""you were domain squatting on X"" is actually useful for exploits.<p>Whats the line where Google considers something domain squatting? Lets say its domain squatting if you have less than 5 pages of content, simply create tons of accounts with varying levels of content. What if the signal is ""has tons of domains"", then run Adsense on tons of domains and see what the threshold is.<p>(etc etc etc)",1244627023

One can only hope that, one day, she'll take a moment to look up from her iPhone to see the other occupants of the bread line.

This is one of the more important questions I ask because it is usually obvious when someone is lying and it helps me understand how this person's previous employer valued them. As an employer, I want to know they were an asset.<p>Yes, someone could lie. People lie all of the time. One of my jobs is to feel that out. I screen for integrity. I look for any hint of lying, even if they are joking. You can always tell someone with integrity from someone without it. And we want to work with people of integrity.",1302961878
2453949,comment,2453771,2453771,7,0,chuhnk,,,"It took me 4 years to realize the benefits of twitter beyond self absorbed social micro blogging. Its a real communication platform which allows you to interact with people around the world. For example the first thing that brought me to twitter was real time updates on a ruby conference. Where else was I going to get that? I can get information before its been posted as news. The great thing about it is respected figures in almost all communities are participating. In a few words they can let us in on what they are working on or take the time to answer questions. If you have a problem you can throw it out there on some hashtag and hope one in a million will respond and usually they will. Its completely changed communication and I cant see it dying.<p>However I believe the micro blogging platform should be treated like email. An open messaging system that can be adopted by anyone and defines an underlying protocol so that we can send messages between all micro blogging sites. I have a gmail account, do I really want to create a hotmail account to email someone with a hotmail domain? If I have a twitter account and someone has an rstat.us account then perhaps I want to message them.<p>I think anyone who did decides to take on the task of turning micro blogging into an open messaging platform would need to look beyond just integrating sign ons. Think of smtp.<p>edit: I missed this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMicroBlogging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMicroBlogging</a>",1302961802

2453933,comment,2453098,2453098,15,0,toddwahnish,,,"We had a similar experience when we created our first designer toy. We were looking for exceptional quality as our designers were incredibly talented and we waned their work showcased in the best possible way.<p>First rule: stay away from Alibaba.\nWe went this route initially, found someone who looked like they could do it, and even found other small toy manufacturers who had supposedly heard of the factory and recommended it. This was important since many of the factories tend to steal and re-post product photos from eachother.<p>We went with this factory, and production started fairly smooth. We let the factory complete the sculpt (a rookie mistake on our part) and we began the tweaking process. Their sculpt was ok, not on model really, and it didnt feel like our product. After a few months of sending photos back and fourth, we asked to have a sample shipped to us so we could see it in person. When we got them in the mail, we knew we were in trouble. Not only were the samples way off model (downright ugly, actually), but they didnt even stand! The factory had, for some reason, rounded the bottom of the feet<p>Decision time- we were already in the hole a few thousand $- its a lot for us, as our entire operation at the time included myself and my fiancee. Were bootstrapped and pay everything out of pocket. We decided to move forward, picking the best of the worst of the samples, and again attaching notes for fixes (can we get the toy to stand, please?). Thats when everything went really south. We never saw any fixes, never got to see the colors printed, or the designs in final form from this factory. What we got were weekly emails for 6 months that basically read, so sorry for the delay, its almost ready- should have them for approval next week.<p>The following year came the stories of the Alibaba CEO stepping down over fraud investigations. No surprise:\n<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704476604576157771196658468.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870447660457615...</a><p>Second Rule: China is the wild west, do it the right way.\nWe started going to trade shows like Toy Fair and others, and began asking people with real product in the market for leads. While most kept their factories a secret, we made progress. We discovered the HKTDC, a more legitimate group, and then caught our break- someone who had connections and personal relationships and connected us to a truly great, legitimate factory.<p>Result: <a href=""http://aartingcollection.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aartingcollection.com</a>  and our first designer toy on the market.",1302961119

As I understand it they provide domain registration on a cost-recovery basis and thus have no incentive to answer support requests for customers who only use NFSN for domain registration. I wouldn't conclude that this means ""please don't do this if you don't have to"".<p>When you use NFSN for domain registration, you will probably also pay for whois privacy ($3.65/year) and DNS services. DNS services for domains registered with NFSN are $1.22/year, but if you host the website for that domain at NFSN you will only pay $0.41/year. So they do actually earn money on domain-only customers and they also give you an incentive to use them not just for domain registration.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#gp_domains"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#gp_domains</a>",1302960373

I've always found this especially ironic, because Orwell was a Marxist who fought with the POUM in the Spanish Civil War.  Granted, a Libertarian Marxist, but I rarely see the types this FAQ is addressed towards willing to make the distinction.<p>And this is unrelated, but I always like to add a nod towards it, if you enjoy Orwell's work, pick up <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>.  One of my favorite books, and even if you disagree completely with Orwell's politics, his writing and storytelling is extraordinary.",1302959576

2453886,comment,2450856,2453433,3,0,rmurphey3,,,"I appreciate your feedback and understand that previous posts of mine have framed this as a jQuery vs. Dojo debate; I tried particularly hard not to do so in this post, and I think you'd be rather hard-pressed to say that this post was a ""jQuery vs. Dojo"" diatribe. Yes, it linked to my Berlin slides, but that's simply because a post in response to them is what got this whole post percolating in my head to begin with.<p>The fact is, though, jQuery and Dojo are the two libraries with which I am quite familiar, and so they are the two libraries I am most able to compare. Having used both, it is easy to see the weaknesses of ... both! I truly believe there <i>is</i> a ""jQuery divide"" -- there are people who think jQuery is what there is to know of JavaScript, and that it can solve all of their problems; then there are the people who know there is more, either because they have always known or because, like me, they've discovered it through some painful mistakes.<p>What I am asking for, in this post and in my Berlin talk, is for the people who know there is more to take some responsibility for bringing the others up to speed, to show people what can be done if you leave behind the ""get some elements, do something with them"" mentality.<p>None of this is to say that jQuery is not a useful tool, and the right tool in so many situations! I have used it, I have contributed to it, I have taught it, I have recommended it. Its API is seductive and its API is a huge contribution it has made to the JS landscape. The point, though, is that it's <i>just</i> an API -- an API that can be and has been be readily replicated. My experience has been that other libraries' APIs can have their own elegance, once you get used to them. The problem is that the appeal of jQuery's API I think is what can lead people to keep approaching problems in a DOM-centric way long after it makes sense. I do not fault jQuery for this, but I think as a wider JavaScript community we do well to discuss -- and not in an us v. them way! -- other viable approaches that exist.<p>Finally: Backbone is a viable entry in the field, and I am eager to see more complex examples (to-do list applications fall far short of this) that use it. I haven't used it personally, but I mostly like what I see and have heard good things about it. Unfortunately it had just come out right before my Berlin talk, and while I may have mentioned it in my actual talk, it isn't in the slides. (That said, I do cringe a tad that its examples suggest (<a href=""http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model</a>) that a ""Sidebar"" is a thing that should be a model.)",1302959449
2453885,comment,2450973,2452790,4,0,weavejester,,,"I'm a biased source, but whilst I agree that Rails is the better option for most professional web development at the moment, the gap has narrowed rapidly over the last year or two.<p>In my opinion, the current things that Rails framework itself does better than Clojure are:<p>1. Model Validations<p>2. Database Migrations<p>3. Project skeleton/generator scripts<p>4. Table relationship sugar (belongs_to etc.)<p>I don't think that's a huge list, and it's actively being worked on. I suspect that we'll have a framework equivalent to Rails sometime early 2012.<p>Of course, this doesn't address the Rails ecosystem, which will probably be larger and more mature than Clojure's for some time to come. However, not everyone needs the full range of plugins available for Rails, so depending on the project, there may not be any difference between using Clojure and using Rails.<p>At which point it comes down to whether you prefer Ruby or Clojure as a language.",1302959446

You harshly criticize the characteristics of this terrible phantom.

I assure you, this straw man doesn't exist.<p>Maybe you've only met one or two in life that gave you a bad impression. You should join #lisp and chat or email Peter Siebel and see if he fits into your stereotype. You might find the experience enlightening.<p>To answer why there are so many Lisp projects with a single developer you will have to answer why there are so few Lisp developers.<p>And here's a hint: It's not because the people who tend to like Lisp easily fit into a simple, boring stereotype.",1302959144

2453878,comment,2453842,2453842,2,0,kitcar,,,"The simple answer is a domain name is very similar to most other pieces of property. Everyone will eventually sell, if you pay a high enough price, because at a certain point the owners quality of life will actually start to decrease by not accepting your offer (due to the opportunity cost of not having the exorbitant amount of funds you are offering). The question is, are you willing to pay that much?<p>So short answer is pick up ""Getting to YES"" from Amazon, a book on negotiations, cold call the owner listed on the WHOIS record, and start negotiating. Hopefully they are reasonable, and you get a deal closed. The holding costs of domains are so low though that the downside from their perspective of not getting a deal done is pretty low, so keep that in mind while negotiating. Best of luck -",1302959131

You made a valid point, and perhaps I was reading too deep, but you have to agree that pg being an investor of RT implies partiality and marks an easy target. Hit or miss is a different matter, but I used it as an example of something that didn't do much for the quality of the essay. But don't get me wrong, I have nothing against RT.",1211086676

Having two or more tasks at hand is always key, so that you can do the least intimidating of the two. The downside to this approach is that sometimes you really do need to do the more intimidating one.",1211086280

It is crazy on how on every city, the oldest parts (the one build before the 30s) are actually design well, human scale, and apealing.Most things built after the 40ss, is this very ugly strip mall design, that is soul drenching, depressing and plain ugly.   You can put as many palm trees as you want, it is still like putting a lipstick on a fat pig.<p>Take example:  San Francisco, built mostly before 1920, and then SJ, or most of the peninsula, build mostly after the 50s.\nWhich tourists ever say, I came here to see San Jose?<p>Even when I visited Kansas City, the oldest part has some good charm and apeal, and some character. As soon as you drove out of the oldest parts, you end up with this insane grid of streets and strip malls.",1211084075

Or as Eliezer Yudkowsky put it ""EURISKO may still be the most sophisticated self-improving AI ever built [...] by Douglas Lenat before he started wasting his life on Cyc.""<p>> <i>I've been playing around with a port of AM for the past coupla weeks.</i><p>From where is the code for AM available? I ask because some people on an AI list I subscribe to think the Eurisko code is unavailable (but would like to get hold of it). You wouldn't have the Eurisko code too, by any chance?<p>> <i>I think the world's coolest AI programs are Eurisko, Copycat and AM.</i><p>I would agree, in terms of modelling general cognition.",1229219180

It sounds pretty severe, like Cisco stands to lose a lot of money but I really doubt that the FSF would be awarded anything here.<p>The defendant (Cisco) gets to deduct ""the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work."" (17 U.S.C. § 504 of the US Copyright Act).<p>I imagine if you take the profit from a single revision of a firmware image and subtract everything that is not attributable to the Readline library (for example, named in the complaint) you can safely round that down to zero.",1229219055

Of course the US is the richest country at the moment, but I wonder if that also goes for the average American?<p>Also maybe in terms of owning things for example maybe it is easier to own a house with garden in the US, making people rich in terms of owning a house and garden. But french people living in an interesting cultural environment in a small flat might feel richer than somebody living in their own house at some crossroad in the middle of nowhere.<p>Overall I guess the average french factory worker doesn't really take 4 hour lunch breaks all the time, either...",1229218542

397127,comment,396596,397023,0,0,timr,,,"I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying.<p>Are you suggesting that France is richer than the rest of the European nations (after cost-adjustment), but that it's still pretty grubby?  If so, then all I can say is that I've been outside the tourist areas of a few different European nations, and they never looked that awful to me -- certainly no worse than rural America.  The people didn't seem unhappy.<p>That said, I think this discussion is a distraction from my primary argument, which is that it's possible to guarantee a higher standard of living for people, without sliding down the slippery slope from corporat-ism to communism.  There's a middle ground -- if our internet companies are 5% less successful, but we have universal health care, I think that's a reasonable trade-off.",1229218235

This seems a little more reasonable but I still think this is a big risk on the part of the FSF.",1229217598

My mother has neuropathy and is in a wheelchair.  It&#x27;s been rough watching her lose function, and now encouraging to see her regain some of her nerve function with immunotherapy and exercise.<p>I&#x27;m running the NYC Marathon to raise money for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of those with paralysis, mobility impairment, and spinal cord injury.<p>The Reeve Foundation has funded over $80 million for paralysis and spinal cord injury research.  Scientists are learning more every year about how the spinal cord works, how nerve cells die and can be regenerated, and how new therapies can promote nerve regrowth. As a direct result of this research, there are people today who can breathe, control their bladder, and walk, after receiving treatment for severe spinal injury.<p>If this is an issue that you are interested in, please consider a donation:  <a href=""http://www.christopherreeve.org/nyc2014/bhousel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.christopherreeve.org/nyc2014/bhousel</a><p>Thanks for listening..",1413863784

The story details here are interesting to me, as my late dad spent the last six years of his life paralyzed from the chin down from a spinal cord injury (a slip and fall on ice on a parking lot). His spinal cord was not completely severed, so he had quite a lot of sensation from the parts of his body that were immobilized, but he was not able to learn to walk with a walking frame even as well as the patient reported on here. (My dad&#x27;s injury was much higher up on the spinal cord, which makes a big difference. His bruising of his spinal cord was at the second cervical vertebra.)<p>The article continues, &quot;All those involved in the research are keen not to raise false hopes in patients and stress that the success will need to be repeated to show definitively whether it can stimulate spinal cord regeneration.&quot; Yes. This is a very early result, but there seems to be something here that has achieved results never before achieved, and if those results can be replicated in other patients, this will be great news.<p>The article mentions what kind of patients the experimental team is looking for. &quot;Dr Tabakow said: &quot;Our team in Poland would be prepared to consider patients from anywhere in the world who are suitable for this therapy. They are likely to have had a knife wound injury where the spinal cord has been cleanly severed.&quot; Many spinal cord injuries are bruises or tears rather than cuts, and may not heal as well with the technique described in the article. But this is a start, and may open up investigation of other approaches to repairing injuries to the spinal cord.",1413862640

Developers just don&#x27;t seem to make that much even though the markets a pretty decent size. Mostly it&#x27;s just simple iPhone apps or games that have been scaled up.<p>The article was suggesting that because theres no trials or demos in the app store, as well as the inability to return things, people are very hesitant to buy at any reasonable price point and those developers are unwilling to put the time and effort in making it that should cost $20 or $30. Since consumers won&#x27;t pay more than a few dollars high-quality in-depth apps are in short supply.<p>In the end it means the iPad feels like nothing more than a giant iPhone, and that&#x27;s basically been my experience. I really would like to see more large fancy apps that would give the iPad its own strong purpose but for whatever reason that&#x27;s not happening.",1413862087

Speech recognition has this inherent delay to it--  it has to delay execution of a command until it&#x27;s concluded that there&#x27;s no other possible interpretation of what you just tried to say.

8485745,comment,8485180,8485521,0,0,e12e,,,"Right. I was just thinking that the most straightforward, naive, approach in java was to have an array of Objects (so you&#x27;d pass around those references), and if you were going to pack everything into a more &quot;primitive&quot; structure (like an array of int8s) it wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to marshal those into objects, but rather go for a more traditional data structure approach and stuff the complexity into some static methods... or failing that at least use some local, long-lived &quot;proxy&quot;-objects with raw attributes:<p><pre><code>    MyVoxel here = new MyVoxel(x,y,z,normal...);
    MyVoxel there = new MyVoxel(); // &quot;null&quot; voxel

    for // some x,y,z
      here.xyz(x, y, z);
      for // some offset_x,y,z
        there.xyz(x+1,...)
        here.distance(there) // or whatever
</code></pre>
Which I suppose is essentially caching objects.<p>The idea of having lots of &quot;new&quot; in (inner) loops... just sounds really weird. Even outside of sub-ms-game-land. I&#x27;m guessing even assigning (as opposed to just using) primitive values to an object probably can have some nasty effects wrt. needless copying -- but it should probably be a lot more predictable than a GC hit -- possible to optimize, and might not trash CPU cache as bad as one might fear.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s quite easy to end up in a mess when trying to do a straightforward rewrite from a static/non-java-oo style to a more java-oo-style -- without some careful thought as to what&#x27;s actually going on...<p>[edit: looking at teamonkey&#x27;s reply further down... I think I&#x27;ve seen some code in this style, creating lots of short-lived objects. Is it considered idiomatic java, or an anti-pattern? (or both? ;)]",1413861218

The key word there is &quot;good.&quot;<p>The thing about rubber dome keyboards is that they are the cheapest kind of keyboard.  So you&#x27;ll find a lot of absolutely awful ones out there.  For example, you&#x27;ll find ones where the amount of force you need to push in the key is unpredictable (keys feel &quot;sticky&quot;).  You&#x27;ll find ones where it takes too much time for the keys to come back up after they&#x27;re pushed down.  You&#x27;ll find keyboards that have almost no weight, so you can&#x27;t type without moving around the keyboard.<p>In contrast, people pay $100-$200 for a mechanical keyboard (they are a specialty item) and the build quality reflects that.  For that money, you usually get something which has a weight in it (so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re typing on a hollow plastic shell), has reasonable ergonomics, and key action that is at least tolerable.<p>I find that I am a heavy typer (I press the keys hard) and I could never get used to mechanical keyboards.  I was always &quot;bottoming out.&quot;  Unfortunately, the hard stop on a mechanical is even harder than the hard stop on a rubber dome.  It&#x27;s like hitting a wall.  There are mods you can make to mechanicals to fix this, but you have to do it yourself.  (For example, you can put rubber bands underneath each key, to get a more gradual stop when you bottom out.)<p>Right now I use a good quality rubber dome keyboard with an included trackpad.  I find that keeping the keyboard in the correct position on my lap is a lot easier when I don&#x27;t need a keyboard tray.  It really is all about ergonomics.<p>My advice to you would be to stop lifting weights for a while.  Just use machines or something to avoid putting pressure on your wrists.  And then get a good quality keyboard.  You will need to try it out before you find the right one for you.  You&#x27;ll probably have to order a few online before you find one you like.  You will also need to start using good typing posture so be sure to research that.",1413861101

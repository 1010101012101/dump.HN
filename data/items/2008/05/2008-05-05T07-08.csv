If you look at their pricing, the $1 is for one credit, and they charge you a certain number of credits based on the size of your file. Here's the catch: it could get very expensive for you if you have a site that is long-tail with lots of files, but on average few views per file. If you have a few files that need to be served, or a few popular ones, it's probably a good deal depending on the quality of bandwidth you need. However, CDNs are a good example of you get what you pay for. If you need Grade A bandwidth and a CDN with a ton of POPs (e.g. for video), my bet is that they won't hold up since it looks like they are more budget and new at the game.",1209974080

181285,comment,180851,180851,0,0,thwarted,,,"RSS needs to be integrated into email clients, not web browsers.  RSS's ""notification"" use cases are closer to email, even in the terminology (""subscribe"").  If there was better support in email clients, RSS would see more use for things like ecommerce shipment notifications, website and ecommerce ""newsletters"" (which often get marked as spam when sent as email) and the like.  The user remains in ""control"" then, unlike email spam, because they can unsubscribe by grabbing the feed anymore.  Reach statistics would be more accurate too (for the same content that was traditionally delivered via email).",1209973109
181284,comment,181244,181244,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"The desire to write a blog (and keep at it) comes from within. You must have a desire to consume the information and then spit it out again in a manner which you see as unique from other people. In some cases, that comes out in different ways (e.g. some people would start a podcast, but not a blog). Also, some people just aren't that into writing extensively.",1209972675

181280,comment,181244,181244,0,0,meredydd,,,"You know, given the context, I'm going to throw out a spurious analogy:<p>Maybe writing a blog bears some small resemblance to doing a startup. It takes more time than is reasonable, in the average case nobody else really notices, and once in a while it will propel a (partially-random) someone to fame and fortune. In other words, it's only really worth it for the sense of personal satisfaction it will give you.<p>Maybe it's my sense of self-preservation, preventing me from maintaining too many irrational behaviours simultaneously?",1209971734

181277,comment,181244,181267,0,0,xirium,,,"> Writing a blog takes dedication and time.<p>Yes. I've also discovered that blogging has to be done very frequently to obtain a significant audience. For example, Paul Kedrosky ( <a href=""http://paul.kedrosky.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paul.kedrosky.com/</a> ) sometimes posts three times per day, seven days per week. I'd rather spend my time doing extended programming sessions. I'm also inclined to write 4000 word epics rather than 100 word stream-of-consciousness posts, so the medium isn't optimal for my style. Finally, I'm not keen on blogging's inherent chronological structure. However, the advent tagging has offset this issue.",1209971565

181273,comment,181244,181244,0,0,tx,,,"99.9% of blogs are crap, including mine. I write it mostly for myself and to polish my English (not my native tongue). I don't believe one should be looking for ""advantages"" when deciding to start a blog. I hate to see what blogs are turning into: they aren't personal anymore and look more like expanded resumes. Blogs used to be just that: a personal diary of what's going on. And silly things like ""Rails Blog"" or ""Java Blog"" just don't make sense: why would someone keep a blog like that - nothing is happening in their life besides Rails or Java?<p>In fact, let's be honest: a blog is just a buzzword. ""Homepages"" have been around forever, why rename them into something which isn't even a real English word. Before '03 corporate websites had a page called ""News"", now they call it a ""blog"" and make it look a little bit more personal.<p>After about 3 years of this ""citizen journalism"" I went back to slashdot, they provide more than enough of daily time wasting material. Real news are in books, never mind that they happened in the past, at least they're true and delivered to you professionally.<p>And finally, I don't trust ""blogs"". Even my modest page with 40 daily accidental readers attracts an email from a PR firm every once in a while, asking me to promote some BS they're getting paid for. I can only imagine how it's like for someone with 10K+ monthly uniques.. Most of these ""bloggers"" are cheap part-time journalists armed with inflated egos but lacking skills/time to check their facts and, sometimes, their spelling.",1209971019
181272,comment,181244,181244,0,0,crazyirish,,,"Why do you assume that people who don't write blogs just ""consumer the information""? I know plenty of people who produce information far more useful than the majority of silly blog posts (like code).<p>For some people, written communication can be quite challenging, but that doesn't mean that they aren't producing information, it just might not inside your view of the world.",1209971004

181270,comment,181244,181244,0,0,gaika,,,"It has to be gradual, there has to be some easy way to get pulled into it. Right now there's too much upfront investment of your time with almost no feedback for too long.

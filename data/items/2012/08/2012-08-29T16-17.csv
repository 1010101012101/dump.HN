The more the market is allowed to work, the better off people will be, and the more food they will be able to buy. Welfare systems offer a temporary solution at the expense of long-term growth, and so are overall negatives to making sure as many people can be as well-fed as possible. Importantly, efforts to artificially solve the high unemployment rates will similarly just increase poverty.<p>This reasoning is separate from the effects of welfare dependence. While they are also important considerations, they are hardly the only ones. The core consideration is as above: there exists a fundamental problem in the market, and throwing money at those most affected by it doesn't solve it, but instead just prolongs it and distributes the issue to those whose money is being thrown. In the long run, things get worse. India's growth is not helped by its programs, but hindered by them; its growth and its poverty levels would be better, not worse, without the programs.<p>So basically, there's no part of any of the calculus that involves ethics or anything. It's purely that we find, scientifically, that if you want the most people to be the most well-fed, market policies and low/no subsidies are the way to go.

The period between solar noons oscillates and varies up to tens of seconds away from precisely 12 hours, thanks to the differing orbital speed of the Earth between perihelion and aphelion.  What you're referring to is ""mean noon"", true solar noon averaged over the course of a year.  See ""mean sun"" : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_sun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_sun</a><p>More complications arise from the position of the Moon.  The Earth's rotation is affected by tides (stronger when the Moon is at perigee), and by the Earth's orbit around the Earth-Moon barycenter.   Precession of the Earth's rotational axis is also a factor.  And many more astromechanical effects also subtly affect the timing of the apparent position of the Sun.<p>Locking our timekeeping to the actual position of the Sun actually proves to be an intractable problem.  At some point, we need abstractions to simplify and assume that that the relation to the Sun is good-enough.  Famously, the Julian calendar was good-enough for millennia until the relation to the sun drifted off true by more than 10 days.

Just because someone uses the tool incorrectly doesn't make it a useless tool.<p>Actually, I think the problem is people tend to make comments which attempt to explain the function of the code at more than a high level. <i>This</i> is the mistake.<p>Your comments should explain the ""why"" of your code but seldom go into the ""what"", because the ""what"" will almost certainly change. And in fact, in many cases the ""what"" may not be entirely determinable from a single point in time with properly uncoupled code.<p>You can sit here and say ""Oh yeah well its the developer's problem to update the comments don't blame the comments."" but the observation that ""what"" comments get out of date is so universal that we should probably accept it as the norm.",1346258196

Overall growth and employment is reduced at the expense of artificially bolstering the farming industry, which otherwise would be seeing necessary cuts in jobs and profit margins. Re: American New Deal farm subsidies and Japanese rice subsidies.<p>2. Oversupplies are offset when the market is fully private, because the price mechanism is a consideration for all participants, not just those who are too rich to qualify for the public distribution system. As a result, Purchasing increases as prices decrease, which India doesn't like allowing.<p>4. Subsidies and freebies exist on the same continuum; when they mean that the government is paying for some portion of the price of a good, they create price floor pressures. Price floors create surpluses [1]. As a result, you have supply exceeding demand, and the country suffers as too much labor is put into producing the oversupply.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Surplus_from_Price_Floor.svg/200px-Surplus_from_Price_Floor.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Surplus_...</a><p>It can be debated all day whether social welfare systems are good or bad, but they are undoubtedly more effective when they support people in very broad ways (such as welfare providing money) rather than narrow ways (such as subsidized food) since the market distortion is more acute when individual industries are subsidized: prices, supply and employment are both distorted. It is natural for countries to reduce the proportion of their population that farms as they grow, and so it's an immediate consequence of that that many farmers need to be allowed to be unprofitable in their farming, so only the most efficient are left.<p>It is incredibly important that the market be allowed to do its work. Prices need to be allowed to go below the point of profitability for many producers such as farmers, because the industries otherwise become overstaffed and create surpluses, which is a far greater harm in the long run. The same for other employment systems, such as the NREGA you mentioned.<p>There exists a tradeoff between economic growth and how much the government forces employment over its natural level. If you look at [2], and replace the y axis with ""Economic Growth level"" and replace the x axis with ""forced employment above natural equilibrium"", you'll find that policies like NREGA are working to push India closer to point C than B. The same tradeoff curve exists for farming profit margins versus food distribution efficiency, and many other things.<p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Production_Possibilities_F...</a><p>But this is an excellent economic case, and it goes to show why well-meaning policies that seek to guarantee the welfare of the few that are most disadvantaged end up creating an overall worse effect--they cannot solve problems, they can only redistribute them across the rest of the economy. A population segment that is producing 1 billion under their GDP potential can be uplifted, and produce at that maximum potential, but at the expense of 2 billion of economic harm done to the rest of the economy. The net result is that overall, the country goes nowhere with its efforts to reduce poverty and create growth. So India's public distribution system may feed a million people, but only at the expense of a massive economic inefficiency, perhaps of the size that could have fed 2 million, or more. The net result is that everyone ends up a little hungrier and a little poorer than they would have otherwise been; and to now return to Kamaal's point, we can now see why these freebies and subsidies cause problems in the first place. They create the very poverty they were designed to solve.<p>The ultimate hallmark of market economics is the recognition that the few can only be saved at the expense of the many. It is only economic and technological growth that ultimately moved entire nation's populations completely above poverty lines, and so all efforts that take away from economic growth to instead give to subsidies and forced overemployment or price floors are also efforts that stop countries from ever moving past those poverty issues in the first place. So saving the few at the expense of the many, over time, undermines your ability to save anyone at all; and countries slide into despair, as those nations that tried the hardest to support the few in theory (such as communist economies) severely underpreform in comparison to free market economies, and eventually disintegrate. India is fortunate to be free enough to avoid that backslide, but it could solve its problems much faster if it were to look to market economics, and allow its problems to solve themselves.",1346257525

I once had an interview for a position that was right up my alley.  I have an MS in Industrial Engineering and I've worked at large manufacturing companies as a developer, as well as smaller startups that create optimization software for manufacturing, shipping, and production systems.<p>I went to an interview for a company almost precisely in this business area.  They asked me to code a singleton, traverse a binary tree, then do it without recursion, add a leaf to a binary tree, prove that the dual of the primal is the primal of the dual, prove various long term outcomes from markov chains, swap two integers without creating a third integer, write various outer joins, convert a sql table to a binary set of indicators (is this a common thing?), and print all possible permutation of string using recursion.<p>At no point did anyone ask about, or even show the vaguest interest, in my background or experience.  It wasn't super well coordinated, they pretty much just kept moving me from one developer to the other - so of course I was much more exhausted and drained than perhaps my interviewer of the hour realized.<p>My interviewers were younger, and generally looked fresh out of their CS degrees, so I'd guess that they were quite a bit sharper where it came to markov chains, hessian matrices, and b-trees.  I didn't look like I was clueless, but I came off as rusty, and I did stumble with things that I would have done much more easily with an hour hitting my old text books.<p>It was eye-opening, and frustrating. I was polite and stuck with it, and I kept trying, because I actually wanted the job, and I thought that they could use someone like me, because while they were very talented, my few questions to them suggested that there were areas where I could bring some experience that they didn't have in house.<p>I didn't get an offer, but I am glad I stuck through it.  The one thing I wish I'd done is <i>politely</i> explain to the hiring manager what I just wrote here - that I think their hiring process might be filtering out an area of talent that could be valuable to the company.<p>Actually, that's probably the advice I'd give the dude who terminated the interview.  Rather than ending it abruptly, ask the hiring manager if he'd be willing to confer for 15 minutes or so.  Explain why you think it's going badly, and what your concerns are.  If you disagree, that's fine - then you can end it on better terms without appearing to leave in a huff.<p>And while this is off topic, I would like to point out one more thing - this is the sort of experience that often comes to my mind when I hear about companies complaining about a lack of available talent, and it's one of the reasons I'm skeptical (though this interview was years ago, when hiring wasn't on fire the way it is now).",1346257367

Especially, mathematics is much too important to be left to the United States public school system in its current condition. I was rereading The Teaching Gap: Best Ideas from the World's Teachers for Improving Education in the Classroom (1999) last month. It reminded me of facts I had already learned from other sources, including living overseas for two three-year stays in east Asia.<p>""Readers who are parents will know that there are differences among American teachers; they might even have fought to move their child from one teacher's class into another teacher's class. Our point is that these differences, which appear so large within our culture, are dwarfed by the gap in general methods of teaching that exist across cultures. We are not talking about gaps in teachers' competence but about a gap in teaching methods."" p. x<p>""When we watched a lesson from another country, we suddenly saw something different. Now we were struck by the similarity among the U.S. lessons and by how different they were from the other country's lesson. When we watched a Japanese lesson, for example, we noticed that the teacher presents a problem to the students without first demonstrating how to solve the problem. We realized that U.S. teachers almost never do this, and now we saw that a feature we hardly noticed before is perhaps one of the most important features of U.S. lessons--that the teacher almost always demonstrates a procedure for solving problems before assigning them to students. This is the value of cross-cultural comparisons. They allow us to detect the underlying commonalities that define particular systems of teaching, commonalities that otherwise hide in the background."" p. 77<p>Plenty of authors, including some who should be better known and mentioned more often by HN participants, have had plenty of thoughtful things to say about ways in which United States mathematical education could improve.<p>A discussion of the Common Core Standards in Mathematics, ""The Common Core Math StandardsAre they a step forward or backward?""<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/the-common-core-math-standards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/the-common-core-math-standards/</a><p>gets into further details of how mathematicians look at the general school curriculum in the United States.

I still have much respect for them because I could see that they are capable and motivated, and were I to encounter them again (which is likely in this industry), I'd be more than willing to put in a good word for them if it would help. Now if someone had up and left halfway through? Well, human nature and emotions are tricky things. Are they within their rights? Of course. Will it strike at my ego or make me feel rejection? Absolutely. Will it form a low level resentment, no matter how minute? Unfortunately, yes. Anyone saying otherwise is simply deceiving themselves. Am I in the wrong for this?

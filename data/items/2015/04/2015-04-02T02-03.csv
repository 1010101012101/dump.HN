Edit2 - add the following<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have been so short or flippant. There is a difference between using water in a way that renders it basically unusable without cleaning/purifying it through energy intensive processes or massive dilution (dumping into the ocean which is still unusable without desalinization) and using water in a way that allows it to naturally return to the system through evaporation.<p>We talk about agricultural use of water as if that creates some sort of excuse to be wasteful. Will not running the water while brushing your teeth or shaving solve the drought? No. Is it completely wasteful and unnecessary? Yes.<p>I completely agree that ridiculously minor &quot;feel good&quot; measures like only getting a glass of water on request at restaurants will do little to nothing to show love any actual problem.

Until I guessed I had reached the point no software updates were likely.<p>I am genuinely disappointed.<p>Despite the initial impression of execution was positive enough for me to have a eight week or so honeymoon. I think the idea has legs longer term.<p>For me, of many many issues I encountered, it is IE tablet / touch version which has been become what in hindsight ought to be a showstopper.<p>There is no alternative for touch use without contortions.<p>Yet IE left to far too much grief.<p>I guess here nobody will freak if I had 50 or more tabs open. Not a usual search decision list to keep handy.<p>But without respite, IE would seize and redraw, reload no matter how cache sized (which pretty much needs a trip to the registry) and commonly crash.<p>I was heavily reliant on a 3G mifi connection during most of this time.<p>It is beyond my comprehension how a browser in theory close to OS that knows I am using a metered connection in particular with long latency, can be shipped with a addiction to cache miss reloads.<p>I would close down tabs carefully and exit IE (touch).<p>Reboot and ....<p>The entire past session and even sometimes earlier sessions would reload.<p>I found that bookmarks did not store or persist.<p>It just goes on and on from there.<p>This is merely the highlight commentary.<p>But within nearly 80 single spaced pages of description, not solely concerning IE behavior, I realized I had been building a &quot;not fit for purpose&quot; complaint.<p>I did not exclusively encounter the IE problems with only a few tab open, either.<p>I actually do think that the shipping state of the Pro 2 would, if I had understood beforehand, guaranteed I did not purchase it.<p>I don&#x27;t maintain a web presence or have access to a appropriate place to publish my extensive review. But I am thinking what to do about that, right now.<p>Although I speak very casually about what ought to touch upon different memory models for touch aps from Metro thinking, the process sumps I ran, API monitoring, attempts at querying NTFS to find &quot;lost&quot; writes and a determined effort to seek out any possible corruption of the SSD writes.... all of which were reasons in terms of finding free time which delayed my formal complaint so far beyond when I first became incredibly frustrated, I hope I may be permitted here a modicum of credibility that I did at least have a fair go at figuring out anything that might be otherwise wrong.<p>I very much like this format.<p>This new 3 might be just the ticket for lightweight moments needing a x86 device I can carry substitute another tablet.<p>Yet, the sad ending to this, is that in my private but professionally minded quest to bring a 5th decade brain out of atrophy and into the current device world, this is the punching:<p>I bought a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact.<p>For everything I commonly did with my Surface Pro 2, exception anything requiring long concentration, I suddenly found myself using the Z3c for entire days and continue to in cactuses it primarily.<p>Even when I have a environment up to write and edit, how exactly can it not plain suck to be fighting with a browser when piling through API refs or SO to check out whichever. That was simply a concentration breaker.<p>I probably will check out the new one as above.<p>But I have rarely found anything so frustrating in primary use as intended or advertised....\<p>And I get done faster with my Z3c, for too many tasks.<p>I almost feel bad at the tome I am about to dump on Microsoft, but I felt strongly enough about the potential utility to me of this device format, I am not writing any consumer report complaint. I very much want my observations, which had me regularly disrupted from my flow even of corridor meetings, to be appreciated. I am to concerned by my experience to plump for a new model without most definitely being certain I can get refund after sufficient time to go the necessary test distance. And absolutely no way will I let myself think a future update will solve anything.<p>That last point, the confidence that updates will resolve glaring problems, is the kind of issue that would have me shut the entire teams to standstill (per Toyota System) until this was understood.<p>At present, the market for any Surface is small and tolerant and sophisticated. But this is if unsolved, a PR problem that could shut down regular consumer retail dead.<p>I may exaggerate, and as well two years ago I thought neither Lumina WP nor Android phones (I tested a variety from mid to flagship) were persuasive, but the change in experience since then has blown my mind. Still yet so much I would do on WP or &#x27;Droid. But the complete experience is entirely impressive. Not only that, but my very elderly family members who are most immune to me thrusting new toys into their hands in ever desperate attempts to connect our diaspora family, are finally impressed. Because above all the response of apps is good enough to prevent a kind of &quot;Senior Valley&quot; in which UX and app latency makes them just pause enough to think they &quot;did it wrong&quot;.<p>The story will continue nevertheless.... it feels like the second or wherever we are counting, Act, is not the dramatic finale but having introduced the Dramatis Personae, we are getting some action sufficient to appreciate full blown characters.",1427943365

Making, as you mentioned, a huge number of edge case decisions. So if innerText was standardized to your use case what would it be good for other than your specific project?<p>Pulling large chunks of plain text as a string to process for any low latency tasks constrains the size of text you can reasonably work with. JS strings are immutable as well, that&#x27;s a lot of copying. So you can&#x27;t be grabbing the whole document at once with innerText, but you still want it to handle line breaks. So innerText is useful for a text editor where the chunks are more than one line long but still fairly short.<p>Another issue is this whole handling of converting lists and tables to some kind of plain text markup. Is that a two translation? Are tabs going to turn into table elements if I have them in a string and set innerText? That seems pretty crazy, but not doing so would just make it very weirdly asymmetrical.<p>I liked the article, lot&#x27;s of good info and stuff I didn&#x27;t know.

I just don&#x27;t see much issue with needing to run one Cmder install though, because I know almost no one who uses the built-in terminal app on OS X either. Installing your preferred terminal is somewhere around step 2, after installing your preferred browser. At that point, it&#x27;s a wash.<p>> Additionally, I don&#x27;t believe you would be very supportive of the experience on Windows if you were more familiar with what is possible on Linux, OSX or any other Unix, and if you had strong understanding/knowledge/command of the toolsets available on those ecosystems.<p>That&#x27;s a huge assumption. Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent a ton of time with everything from DOS 1.0, to the Amiga CLI + REXX, to Solaris and AIX, to Slackware/RedHat/Ubuntu, to OS X, and to Windows. I first learned assembly on SGI Indigos running Irix and first accessed the web via Mosaic running on SPARCstations. I feel fairly confident in my perspective when it comes to the nuances of various platforms, but I currently prefer Windows.<p>I mean this in the least confrontational way possible, but that&#x27;s precisely the kind of off puttingly patronizing &quot;you&#x27;d understand if you didn&#x27;t use Windows&quot; shtick I often see from Mac/Linux users that motivates me to comment on these threads.<p>Heck, just last weekend I was ripping a buggy apt-installed xcache out of the Ubuntu/Linode apache server that hosts my blog and replacing it with a compiled .so to fix a bizarre edge case where xcache was breaking one of my WordPress plugins (and sucked up two weeks, on and off, of debugging with the plugin&#x27;s author). In my experience, these type of opaque problems are tremendously more common on *nix than on a modern Windows Server.<p>BTW, I use ssh from the Cmder command line when I log in to that Linode VPS, just like you might from the command line on any other platform.<p>> For instance, installing PostgreSQL/MySQL/Apache/Nginx/or whatever on Windows is extremely painful, cumbersome, and not standardized across systems. Conversely, compare this: (yum|apt-get|port) install (postgresql|mysql|apache|nginx).<p>Come on. No one who has ever installed any of those things in production would pretend it&#x27;s so simple. You&#x27;re going to spend so much time on configuration that the difference between apt-get and running an .msi is negligible.",1427942137

9308325,comment,9307255,9307255,0,0,phodo,,,"Yes! Especially if you know the folks and with respect to helping with documentation and onboarding. I&#x27;m technical, but my role in a fairly large, well known open source project was strictly non-technical. Best summed up as: &quot;other&quot;. What was interesting is that my role wasn&#x27;t only product-y in nature (product is my professional calling card). It also included project management, sales (I explain what sales means in the context of open source below), and bd. Ironically, contrary to my advice to you about documentation, I did not focus much of my energies there as an individual contributor, that was already being done already and we worked with customers to improve that. However, onboarding new users is a big challenge for many projects, and I do think the need is there.<p>Some background: At the time, the project was created and maintained by a very smart technical maestro / team which included a small core team of 1-2 developers. There is/was a large 3rd party ecosystem with shims and plugins into every known framework/language.<p>This open source framework that I speak of has achieved product / market fit in my view. But like many activities, it was clear that while that value was being created (problem / solution fit,  product / market fit), it was hard to make the leap to capturing this value (sustainable business model so it doesn&#x27;t need to rely on external funding).<p>My contribution can best be summarized as product management, with heavy emphasis on customer development, standard product management (but less emphasis on product roadmap work, since the technical creator did most of this), lean canvas/ business model work, business plan, working with lawyers, sales and bd work. I relied heavily on my own product / pricing experience and Steve Blank&#x27;s / Lean Startup approach to figure out some key questions for customer development &quot;get out of the building&quot; type work: e.g. to make this project sustainable on its own accord, is there revenue we can get in the form of support? Because the project has growing traction across the world, I was able to speak with several potential customers who were using the project heavily in their engineering organizations, and learn about their additional problems they have.This then informed the paid &quot;support&quot; solution we proposed. In many cases, customers were satisfied with the free open source version, and we gave them support as well.<p>One of the most satisfying things was working with early prospects on defining what it meant to &quot;sell an open source product&quot;... the &quot;capture value&quot; part I spoke of above. This had unique challenges because we wanted all deliverables to customers to go back to open source, which we achieved successfully.<p>Apologies for the long post. tl;dr: yes you can help, especially if you know the folks. I think you&#x27;re on the right track. If you&#x27;d like to learn more details and if I can help you think through any parallels or questions to your own work, feel free to ping me.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).<p>We are excited to hear from you!",1427940517

It&#x27;s so many people, in fact, that they can&#x27;t possibly verify all of the sites these people want to visit. So instead of burdening CNNIC with verifying the identity of every single site that wants a cert that their users will trust, CNNIC will just verify some other CAs as being trustworthy enough to do the job.<p>Personally, I think I should trust the hardware or OS manufacturer to pick exactly who is trustworthy enough to certify websites, since I&#x27;m trusting them that my computer is doing what it looks like it&#x27;s doing anyway.",1427940380

The battery really is a large array of commodity batteries made by panosonic. Tesla is doing the gigafactory for vertical integration and to bolster it&#x27;s own supply. Obviously, they have done a lot of innovation around the pack in terms of heat distribution and cell construction, as well as the management system. The innovation is really about the macro-cell construction and the software to manage the array. On a micro-level it is just a bunch of commodity batteries wites into small cells, that make up a large cell array.",1427940375

He mentions some of the other breakthroughs on iltra-capacitors having the efficiency of a lead battery, but, while extremely efficient, the prototype used an extremely rare material that only was mined in a few tonnes a year.

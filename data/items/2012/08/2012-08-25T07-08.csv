Just money. Other countries see health as a right (luckily thats the case here in Argentina). So, most medics dont get super rich. They work for a salary, they dont get 30 or 50 grand for a surgery.  But they still do their job, they work hard and they give their best (well, most of them). Because when you choose that kind of profession, its not for making lots of money, but to help people. Or at least, thats how it should be, and I'm absolutely sure that there are lots of medical  doctors there that think this way, but they are just the little fishes inside a pool full with big sharks.<p>I feel sorry for you USA, because you lost it and you wont get it back. There are lots of interests against it.<p>There's not political will, there's not professional will (AMA anyone). Sometimes, from the outside it seems like there's not even a cultural or popular will. A few months ago I discussed this with an American friend and he was totally against universal health care. His argument was something like ""why should my taxes pay for some random unemployed or most probably lazy man's health"" ""if he gets free health care he won't work as hard"" ""if i make more money why should he have the same benefits as me?""  And my answer ""because he's a human being too""didn't seem to help.<p>You said it yourself, 17/18 % of the biggest gdp in the world and still cant take care of all of your people. Think about it. Just imagine what you could do with that money in a different system.<p>Seeing this kind of things happening there I can only think about the USA, as a strange place.

If you want to employ a systems thinking view of the world to make a point, you need to chase the rabbit all the way down the hole.<p>Google didn't create all that wealth. They took a large part of that wealth from other advertising companies - primarily newspapers. And that money came from companies which in turn came from consumers. A good part of the wealth of companies is from arbitrage, monetising previously non-tradable items and digging stuff up - you know, externalities. A good portion from consumers is intergenerational. Very little actually comes from wealth creation.<p>Wealth is for all practical purposes, finite. This does not mean it is fixed. As a previous commenter pointed out, global economic growth is increasing at 3-4%.. at least some small portion of this is due to wealth creation rather than the monetisation thing. Understand also that monetisation usually transfers wealth rather than creates it, but sometimes can actually reduce wealth overall (take say, tobacco companies as a non-controversial example.. a controversial, though equally true, example might be BP or Shell).<p>Then you start asking yourself, if wealth is largely finite.. and some companies are making money hand over fist, then surely someone must be losing out? Why exactly do you think there are people living around the world who cannot afford good healthcare or clean water? You think they are just lazy? You actually believe all that BS in the doco you watched?<p>It also amazes me when people point out how generous US companies and people are in philanthropy - generally 1-2% of profit - while completely turning a blind eye to the very low levels of tax they pay. The democratic-capitalist-welfare state has a bigger positive impact worldwide to population health than all the charities put together, and it can be cheaper to run.<p>And another thing, you think google giving the doctors 500k is actually significant? In addition to the $400m / 80% figures already pointed out, think about the individual contributions - peoples life work. Also from wikipedia, in 07 there were 26,000 professionals who helped MSF. I don't know if you are aware, but people who work for charities don't get paid as much.. and that is if they are not just volunteering their time. Say 26,000 x 10% pay cut x ave wage (in aus dollars with aus wages this would be about $130m, you can adjust elsewhere if you like).<p>130 million a year in wealth donations from ordinary people.<p>I am all for wealth creation, which I think was the crux of the OP - if you are not contributing value to people's lives, you are not creating wealth, just taking it from someone else. And I don't discount the efforts of the people you mention. I think companies like google have helped in other ways with more impact than just their cash. Just want you to see these efforts in context, and maybe think a bit deeper. Because it is a very long rabbit hole.<p>And because it irritates me.",1345880033

Well Steve Jobs liked to quote something like this: <i>""Good artists copy. Great artists steal.""</i> Jobs was clearly spreading the message  that Apple liked to steal mastering the ""borrowed"" product making it into a product of their own. Apple made no secret about stealing design from Braun and Sony. Jobs had great respect for those companies.
And I think the same applies to Samsung. They have great respect to Apple (although today that may have changed) and mastered the iPhone into an even greater product than the iPhone.<p><i>""We value originality and innovation and pour our lives into making the best products on earth.""</i>
Well they may be the best looking products on earth for some, but they are absolutely not the best products. Apple mouses look great and are great to obtain RSI. MacOs is looking great but I can't get as productive with it as with Windows or Linux. The Mac Mini is looking great but I can buy twice the power for the same price. Most Apple products are looking great but why not supply a standard connector? Well we know the reason for that one. And now they are called the most valuable company of today.<p>Yes Samsung did look very closely to Apple's products but so did Apple to other products.<p>We all copy!<p>-edit1- Brown -> Braun ;) thanks.<p>-edit2- I also was thinking about a tablet I once bought. This was a complete copy of the iPad. Even the box had the same white design. But Apple didn't go after that company. Why? Because it was a peace of crap. You had to break the tablet before the screen became responsive and the battery didn't last 10 minutes.",1345878381

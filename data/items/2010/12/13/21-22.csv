And by risk, I mean that they were allowed to borrow money to make bets on the future value of securities.  They believed that most of that risk was offloaded to a company that could absorb it (AIG) but it turns out that they couldn't.  When everyone found out that AIG couldn't absorb that risk (defaults on mortgage-backed securities), they ran for the hills (refused to lend money with mortgage-backed securities as collateral).<p>Hedgehogging will give you a good idea of the people/mentality that drives traders and how managing big money works.  It's a complicated business and quite different from your regular mom-and-pop investor.  One of the lessons I took from the book was that being very successful in your fund can lead people to WITHDRAW their money from your account.  It's like they expect you to be unable to repeat your performance.<p>Another lesson is that a lot of hedge funds fail.  Their fund manager can't get out of a slump and everyone takes their money out.  The fund closes.<p>But the best lesson is the analogy of fund managers to star athletes.  Those managers that can consistently beat the market are paid very well because they are making a lot of other people very very rich.  That's rare and not a lot of people can manage it.",1292277171

I thought by now most devs had at least read a little Codd, Date, and/or Pascal.<p>Maybe it comes from having started building web and db apps for large enterprises where the DB was the nucleus of the operation and the apps the satellites.  It seems among the web crowd it's the opposite - the app is the nucleus, with the DB and presentation layer the satellites, resulting in ORM among other things.<p>In those enterprises, access to the DB's was strictly controlled by the DBA team and data made available to apps via stored procs only.  The app devs would request a stored proc with certain parameters that would return a certain dataset, and the DBA team would implement it and grant access to that app only (or grant access to an already-existing sp that did the same thing).<p>The idea of ORM still bugs me for that reason, even though I use it anyway.

The Washington Post is using a somewhat exaggerated title here.<p>Personally, I recall, in early September (2008), thinking that it would be great if the Fed let a large financial operator fail. I am fairly stupid, and sometimes I think in terms of simple cause and effect, and this was a clear case of that - I was thinking it would send a clear message that financial firms needed to get their act together. Then Paulson and the Fed allowed Lehman to fail. My first thought was, ""This is great, now the other firms will get the message."" I was totally innocent about the extent of the leverage in the system and the degree of peril the other firms faced. As the disaster played out in late September, I realized how naive I'd been.  I suppose most people, like me, learned only then how weak the system was. The Fed's unusual decisions were well known by  the early of October (2008). If you read blogs like CalculatedRisk, one could follow the unorthodox extensions of the Feds programs. They were unusual, but I recall, there was the sense that orthodoxy had been discredited with the collapse of Lehman.<p>There was a good post on Calculated Risk at one point (early 2009, I think) about the benefits of paying out the full dollar on defaulted financial instruments, even to foreign firms - foreign banks had lent huge sums to finance mortgages in the US, if the foreign banks were to dump those loans, then the prices of US homes would have been driven down even lower and faster than what was already happening.",1292276362

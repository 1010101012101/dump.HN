1878500,comment,1878392,1878392,0,0,RBr,,,"Here are a couple of things that I've learned specific to your questions.  They're sure no book, but I don't think that a practical guide exists.  Being good at conferences is as individual as writing code - it's an extension of yourself.<p>- how to get in and out of a conversation circle<p>If people are heavily engaged, this is very difficult and you can easily step on the toes of the folks engaged in conversation.  Generally, as long as the conversation doesn't ""feel"" private, stand near the circle and nod a lot.  Then, when you have something truly intelligent to add, offer that up.  Instantly, you will then be part of the conversation.  If you don't have an intelligent part to add, don't.  Use this opportunity to break into another group by saying ""Bill over there was just talking about tktkt, what do you think of that?""<p>- event invitations: when is it ok to go and not go<p>Private events are not ok.  Don't show up at the bar or otherwise crash it.  Get on the list and do it the right way.  At some large, stupidly exclusive events such as Ted, it's ok to show up in the hotel bar and mingle with the folks who paid to be there.<p>- what's the appropriate amount to talk about yourself and your idea<p>I use personal information to engage others to talk about themselves.  I don't directly talk about myself.  A natural part of conversation is to engage people personally in a back-and-forth manner.  However, if someone talks about their office in San Francisco, exchange a fact about yourself that involves the area.  Use tidbits of information about yourself to engage, not fill conversation.  When asked, answer every single personal question honestly and deeply.  This goes a long way to developing a relationship.  It is however handy to have a few interesting, entertaining stories about yourself.  This makes for great dinner conversation where back-and-forth often turns into somewhat of a round-robin of stories.<p>- how to identify this conversation is going nowhere<p>I never assume that a conversation isn't going anywhere.  One of my biggest pet peeves at conferences are folks who are only there to talk to the heavy hitters.  I get wanting to maximize your time, but understand that no single group of people or individual is as valuable as the collection of people attending a conference.  There are usually very large brain trusts at events and if you can get a feel for the entire crowd and even have a set of questions answered by a variety of people, this is the best case scenario.  Remember that conversations have a natural arc.  If you feel stuck in a conversation, you need to learn how to naturally arc the conversation earlier so that you can gracefully move without being noticed.<p>- how to approach FAMOUS GUY<p>Remember that you likely won't actually have a discussion with famous people at events.  Famous folks (no matter if they're on the bill or not) talk to a lot of people at events and the chance of you gaining any insight or that they will even remember you after you walk away is negligible.  My best advice is that if you have some business with someone famous to walk up to him or her after he or she is done presenting, when you notice that they have a quite moment or if all else fails after they come out of the bathroom (never while in the bathroom).  Quietly but confidently say something like ""Hi Jimmy, my name is John, I know this isn't a great place to talk, but I've come here just to introduce myself in the hope that we can talk again.  Here's my card with a note on the back about what I want to talk about.  Could you give me a call when you have time or could I call you?""<p>- how to appropriately ask your friend to introduce you to his friend, FAMOUS GUY<p>I wouldn't sweat famous people too much.  Sure, they look cool and have cool people around them, but for the most part, they're just people with more money then you.  The real question that you should be sweating over is, what are you going to do so that people want to be introduced to you?  It doesn't matter if your friend knows a music legend or is dating a model, people are people.  If you hang around the right people enough, you'll get to know famous people without trying.  Specifically at conferences, I'd think carefully about how much value waiting in line (and there is always a line) to talk to someone famous is.  Personally, I'd rather talk to everyone in that line and everyone else at the event and then, if need be, talk to the famous person outside of the busy event to connect some dots.",1289098766
1878499,comment,1877649,1877765,0,0,netcan,,,"Said another way.<p>Where there is an active market for private company shares open only to a limited group (employees, investors and other existing shareholders), potential sellers (employees & investors) have had reasonable opportunity to sell however much they want. Potential buyers, on the other hand, do not necessarily have the opportunity to buy. So if you are relating to the value a company would have a following an IPO, you would expect the value to rise. There aren't many new sellers at the internal market valuation price or lower (they could have sold before at that price).",1289098718

1878496,comment,1878160,1878160,0,0,sp4rki,,,"Call me skeptic but none of the experiments or the so called ""significant laboratory evidence of psi"" are conclusive at all. Premonition deals mostly with feeling something before it happens and precognition deals with seeing things before it happens. I believe the former is side effect of a mind that analyzes and understands patterns with fairly good accuracy, while the latter is nothing than pure coincidence. It's easy to say random things like ""my dog is looking at a turtle"" 100 times and get some percentage correct, but I bet you that if I asked you about it, you would only remember the correct ones and mostly discard all the times you where wrong.<p>Hell not only do it all the time, I did it three times in the last hour while I was taking a shower. I ""saw"" my dog pee on the studio, I ""saw"" my significant other arrive with chicken, and I ""saw"" a call from my sister. I leave the room and my dog peed on the studio, my girlfriend is eating some roasted chicken and my sister called me while I was reading this article. Does it mean I'm a psychic? <i>HELL NO!</i> I've done that same exact thing before, probably by analyzing patterns, and have been utterly wrong.<p>Believing in this stuff would mean that our futures are ruled by some kind of destiny, which is fine for Prince of Persia, but really makes absolutely no contribution to our collective sanity.<p><i>Wohooo I just imagined my girlfriend is going to come out of a giant cake wearing a spandex catsuit.

1878461,comment,1877527,1877527,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"""and sometimes set up their own online authentication systems to give people the feeling they have a legitimate product""<p>The fragment above is as close as this article's author gets to what I believe to be the core economic argument for Microsoft's anti-piracy strategy.  Someone who would never think of spending $300 for a legitimate MS Office license might pay $3 for a DVD from a street vendor knowing full well that the DVD is pirated.  People making such a purchase almost always know that they are not buying a legitimate copy.  These sales are only one small step away from just downloading a copy of Office via torrent.  What rationally must concern Microsoft is when consumers pay tens of dollars for ""discounted"" software with the belief that they are purchasing a legit license.  That's likely lost revenue for Microsoft (only ""likely"" because the consumer might not have paid the higher price of a legit copy).<p>Imagine that I went into a diner where servers ""self bank"" (take cash payments directly, usually using an apron with money pockets), pretended to be a server, and presented customers with fake checks.  The customers would pay me and leave thinking that they had completed a legitimate transaction.  Obviously, the restaurant's top line suffers, but this sort of theft is worse than if those same customers entered the restaurant with the intent to dine & dash.  Why? Because they probably wouldn't have eaten there if an armed guard had been checking receipts at the door.  So, the restaurant is out only its marginal cost (probably just the cost of the food if seats were still available, about 30% of the check on average across the restaurant industry).  So, while these two kinds of theft might seem identical on the surface, the one where I pose as a fake waiter is over three times as costly for the restaurant.<p>The market for fake designer handbags is similar.  There are two categories of fake goods: those designed to fool the buyer, and those simply manufactured only well enough to convince the buyer that others will perceive the good to be legit.  Most luxury purses have internal markings (gilded logos, etc.) which help identify the brand, but only to the owner (presuming that she is the only person who actually sees the inside).  If the buyer knows the purse to be fake but desires to impress those who see her carrying it, there's little incentive to pay extra for a purse with replicated innards.  However, if a merchant wants to sell a fake handbag for a good price to a buyer who thinks it legit, the details had better match up with those observable at Saks.  Handbag manufacturers rationally spend most of their time going after those producing the high quality fakes as those have an immediate impact on revenue.  Unlike Microsoft, there is also a strong incentive to attack the market for real-from-a-distance knockoffs as the economic signalling effect of a $1K handbag is weakened when the public computes the likelihood to be low of an arbitrary woman with such a bag to be carrying a legit version.<p>I was disappointed by the shallowness of the NYT's analysis in the article.

The end game will have Oracle having a controlling position in every aspect of Enterprise software development.<p>First of all, Oracle has removed InnoDB from the MySQL Classic Edition. Now, you can still get the GPL community edition that has InnoDB in it.  But if you want support, you’ll have to buy their version.  Oh, and they just raised the price on that.  I’m not sure if they require it or not, but if you use Linux Oracle prefers that you run their software on THEIR version of Linux – a customized Red Hat.  This week they also released plans for the JVM that will include a free version and a premium paid version.  Oh, and if you want some new hardware that will really make it all work well together, they can sell you that too (they bought Sun, remember?).<p>So it’s pretty clear to me that Oracle is playing for keeps, and playing to own the Enterprise space.  Want to use a database?   Buy Oracle, or use MySQL… but if you want support, you pay them.  Then you pay them for Linux.   Then license the JVM.  Then license the app server (they bought BEA last year, so WebLogic is all theirs now too).  Want to code in Java?  Well, they own that too.  Business folks call this “owning the vertical.”<p>Watch for them to take even more steps to make sure that they have control points around as many places they can.  Nearly all software that gets written is business application software.  Clearly Oracle has been embedded firmly there for a long time – but these moves are enveloping and will sink hooks into so many more places.   I predict that when Google and Oracle settle – and they will eventually, since the cost to litigate a huge patent battle does no good for either party – that Oracle will get some hooks into mobile as well.  Maybe some email integration, or provisioning, or something deep and fundamental.<p>So watch out, stay alert, and think about your tools.  Or you too will be assimilated.",1289095312

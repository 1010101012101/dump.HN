Granted, the install process was a breeze--I&#x27;d expect this from a Ubuntu clone--but once the system is installed it&#x27;s far from stable. Pantheon is a great step forward for Linux UI design but it can be very buggy compared to the tried and true alternatives. Even Unity, as much as I detest it, runs very smoothly.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, maybe eOS runs perfectly on everybody else&#x27;s computers, but the standard install has proven a little buggy and I&#x27;ve had to make adjustments from the command line to make it usable.<p>I think if Windows or OS X didn&#x27;t work out-of-the-box, I&#x27;d want a refund and I&#x27;d consider a free alternative. eOS is great for free, but for money?

Hoping
  to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said &quot;Master, I have
  heard that objects are a very good thing - is this true?&quot; Qc Na looked
  pityingly at his student and replied, &quot;Foolish pupil - objects are
  merely a poor man&#x27;s closures.&quot;

  Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his
  cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire
  &quot;Lambda: The Ultimate...&quot; series of papers and its cousins, and
  implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object
  system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of
  his progress.

  On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by
  saying &quot;Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now
  understand that objects are truly a poor man&#x27;s closures.&quot; Qc Na
  responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying &quot;When will you
  learn? Closures are a poor man&#x27;s object.&quot; At that moment, Anton became
  enlightened.
</code></pre>
Now I will be the first to admit that I usually just don&#x27;t get koans.  But I think I get this one.  Objects and closures are equivalent in the sense that what you can do with one you can do with the other.  However, for each particular case one may be better (easier to use, more natural, whatever) than the other.  You should use which ever one is the best for each particular problem.<p>This is of course easier if you are using a programming language that natively supports both closures and objects...",1428861363

Okay, you get a supply of those pills as well, and take one every ten hours.  This leaves you all set to spend practically infinite time writing out all this meticulous description.<p>Now, once you&#x27;re FINALLY done, and have done up through t=10minutes, which really practically takes you infinite time, you bind up all of your work and put the volumes in a row in multigalactically large bookshelf.  Trillions of volumes.  Then you&#x27;re transported back to Earth and time resumes.  Okay, for having trillions of volumes, ten hours (that you remember) wasn&#x27;t too bad.<p>And now we know there are a series of volumes of books (that you&#x27;ve prepared by hand).  At first (in the first few volumes) they describe an initial state of mind, and, due to the moment that was chosen (someone entertaining a train of thought regarding the Cogito) as you go through the volumes you are reading through someone&#x27;s thoughts, i.e. the thoughts that this person exists.<p>But do they exist?  Of course not: they are just a character in a book.  That they think, &quot;I think&quot; does not cause them to exist, and a few volumes later they are done having that thought.<p>The volumes are all there from volume 1 up till x trillion trillion.  You could, if you wanted to, read through them all.  Do the characters inside exist?  No.<p>So, the Cogito does not prove physical or metaphysical existence.",1428860635

What used to entail walking across town and physically talking to someone is often now just a Facebook update or text message. Searching a cell phone now is probably about comparable to searching a home in 1996 in terms of how invasive it is, but we weren&#x27;t making the argument two decades ago that the police shouldn&#x27;t be able to get a search warrant for your home because it&#x27;s too invasive.<p>Searching a cell phone is <i>much more</i> than what they would get from searching a home. Twenty years ago if a suspect walked across town two weeks before the crime and had a conversation with someone, there would be no automatic record of it even happening, much less the content of the conversation being recorded indefinitely. Even for written correspondence, people rarely keep every letter they&#x27;ve ever received and even less often keep a copy of every letter they&#x27;ve ever sent.<p>People have no obligation to carry around a tracking device that records everywhere they go and everything they say in a format understandable by the government.<p>> To continue following that logic out, neither phones in general nor surveillance existed in 1776. Does that mean the police shouldn&#x27;t be able to get warrants to read someone&#x27;s phone records or see surveillance footage because they could still gather evidence just fine before those existed?<p>You keep conflating the question of whether they can get a warrant with the utility of doing so. Encryption has existed longer than the United States. A warrant grants them the ability to look at your stuff, it doesn&#x27;t imply that they&#x27;ll be able to understand it, or even that you&#x27;ll have kept any stuff worth looking at.<p>For example, shouldn&#x27;t you have the same objection to Snapchat as you have to encryption? The government&#x27;s warrant gives them even less if the content no longer exists than if it exists encrypted.

Two objects are free to have their own &quot;version&quot; of the same operation (same-named), and when you invoke it on an object, you get that object&#x27;s version. In writing one of those operations, you have a handle on the thing you&#x27;re operating on without having to take it as an argument. This specifies what result you&#x27;ll compute and what side effects you&#x27;ll cause by invoking an operation (i.e., the semantics).

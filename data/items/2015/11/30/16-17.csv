TLA+ is a good, beginner-friendly entry point to formal methods (and you can slowly progress from specification to model-checking and only then proofs), even if you later choose to move to dependent-type approaches and tools like Coq or F*.<p>> TLA+ is for totally different jobs. Not relevant here.<p>I beg to differ. TLA+ is commonly (as far as the word &quot;commonly&quot; can be used when formal methods are discussed) used to specify and verify programs in C or any other language.<p>It is true that Coq has been used to verify compilers more than TLA+, while TLA+ has been used to verify algorithms (esp. concurrent/distributed) more than Coq, but the reason is not because neither could do the other&#x27;s job, but because of their respective progeny. Coq (as all type-theory tools) is closely associated with PL-theory people, who tend to be more attracted to compilers, while TLA+ originated from the software-verification world (mostly Pnueli&#x27;s temporal logic), and created and promoted by Leslie Lamport, most certainly an &quot;algorithms&quot; (specifically distributed/concurrent) guy rather than a &quot;PL&quot; guy.<p>BTW, Isabelle is one of the proof engines used by the TLA+ proof system.",1448902412

The empirical evidence of 70&#x27;s-90&#x27;s showed the best ways to reduce defects were the following:<p>1. Unambiguous specifications of what the system will do.<p>2. Implementation in safe languages or subsets with plenty of interface checks.<p>3. <i>Human review</i> of design, implementation, and configuration looking for errors. Best results were here.<p>4. Usage-based testing to eliminate most errors user will experience in practice.<p>5. Thorough functional and unit testing.<p>(Later on...)<p>6. Fuzz testing.<p>7. Static analysis.<p>Practices 1-4 were used in Cleanroom, some major commercial projects, and high assurance security work. Every time, they produced results in preventing serious defects from entering the system that often might have slipped by testing. So, those are where the majority of our verification work should go in. Supporting evidence is from those that do a subset of that from OpenBSD team to Microsoft&#x27;s SDL along with substantial defect reduction that followed.<p>Note: 6 and 7 showed their value later on. No 7 should definitely be done where possible with 6 done to a degree. I haven&#x27;t researched 6 enough to give advice on most efficient approach, though.<p>So, internal testing and coverage are the weakest forms of verification. They have many benefits for sure but people put way too much effort and expectations into them where it pays off more elsewhere. Do enough testing for its key benefits then just cut it off from there. And don&#x27;t even do most of that until you&#x27;ve done code reviews, etc which pay off more.",1448901933

Redistributing $7,000 is doable.  I don&#x27;t know of any policies, or even any set of policies that would increase the size of the economy by 25%.  This is even more insurmountable given that in recent history the gains from growth have not been distributed equitably.   We would need to see an order of magnitude more growth, an increase in the economy of 250%-500% before the poor would be substantially better off.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf</a>\n[1] - <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA</a>\n[2] - <a href=""https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/families/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/famil...</a>",1448901525

10650157,comment,10646100,10649961,0,0,talmand,,,"It&#x27;s easy to find designs that are bad ideas for web pages. The most obvious culprit is a design that&#x27;s excellent for a magazine layout. Such designs typically don&#x27;t take into account the document flow nor the idea that different people open their browsers to different resolutions and browser window sizes. Heck, some won&#x27;t even take into account different browsers with different capabilities. I think I understand where you&#x27;re going with the &quot;what is a web page?&quot; bit, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply. Especially since a web page can be whatever anyone wants within the limitations of a browser, but that doesn&#x27;t mean a design works based on some person&#x27;s idea of what they think a web page is. In most cases a design is limited by the browser, not necessarily by the code of the page.<p>I have no idea what you mean by your second sentence.<p>And then, are you referring to my mindset or some other mindset? Because I fail to see how you can know my mindset on the matter. If it&#x27;s the other, I would agree. Except I would say that &quot;fixing&quot; something in terms of making it do something it wasn&#x27;t intended in the first place may possibly create more problems than we are attempting to fix. I would suggest attempting new things to see if they work, which there are some doing just that. I would point out that flexbox is an example of this.<p>I&#x27;m excited with flexbox and have started pushing to make use of it more often, when warranted. It&#x27;s hard to switch current code to it, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.

Postgres 9.5 is supposed to include DDL messages in logical decoding, which will help for our pipeline from Postgres databases, but we&#x27;d love to develop a more robust system for automatically updating the Redshift schema to accommodate changes in the incoming data format. Naive solutions would likely be susceptible to unwanted behavior coming from spurious messages.

To build a real fixed length array, you need to build it on top of lower-level primitives.

This model (trust but verify) lends itself to having more spammy apps submitted to it (no proof, just an educated guess).  Google is providing a gateway for others to generate income.<p>The OP stated:\n1) They had a disclaimer in multiple places.\n2) They reached out explicitly because they weren&#x27;t sure where the real problem existed.\n3) Only one app was notified at a time when multiple apps had been following the same style and none were notified until later.  Surely Google would want to investigate whether the developer posted any other apps which might be in violation?\n4) Was not trying to nor had any interest in making any money off of this set of apps.<p>It has been said, the OP was naive and should have pulled the apps after the first notice since they were just beta.

From Mayans to Mediterranean civilizations (several of them actually) to the 5 centuries of decline and stagnation of China, and probably countless more I haven&#x27;t read about. And the industrial world is <i>far</i> less resilient. We depend on huge amounts of infrastructure and massively complex systems of trade and production.<p>Very likely we would return to subsistence farming. There would be little or no remaining industry, and not enough resources to support it. Generations would go by with little technological progress. Metal would rust away, buildings collapse, forests regrow, and after awhile there wouldn&#x27;t be much left of our civilization. (This is of course assuming a <i>worst case</i> scenario where the whole world is bombed or a nuclear winter happens.)<p>When we did finally get around to trying to rebuild civilization, sure there would be some scattered resource deposits around the world, but not enough to do anything with. You can&#x27;t build steam engines without perfecting metallurgy and abundance of cheap, strong, metal. You need to produce many tons of cheap coal, not just scattered surface deposits.

Places like Quebec City are a good example, but what really fascinates me is Tokyo, a behemoth of a city with <i>so much</i> that is walkable with one-way streets and wide sidewalk areas, and you can get to anywhere easily via buses and rail links.  All these simple one-way streets, connecting to arterial roads with 1 lane in each direction, connecting to highways, create an absolutely massively distributed road system.<p>If you think i&#x27;m exaggerating, pull up Tokyo in Google Maps and pick a spot at random in the surrounding metro area and go to Street View, you will always always land on a one-way road, often with people walking on it.",1406775030

This is my interpretation:<p>Given the technological improvements, privacy is unsustainable. If everyone realizes this and accepts it, we can reap the benefits of transparency. In a society that does not hold bad actions against those who already paid their due fine (or served the due time). Neither does that future society discriminate against people who are different. In that society, privacy will probably be beneficial only to the dishonest.<p>Now, I personally don&#x27;t think if we can reach that stage of maturity, not anytime soon at least.

The original study was that practice counted for much more in fields where the rules and values were stable (like musical instruments or games) and much less where the basic ground rules couldn&#x27;t even be described (like business or war).<p>That part makes a lot of sense: practice and correcting errors only matters when you will be doing something basically the same next time and you have a fixed target of what &quot;good&quot; looks like to shoot for.  It also explains a big question I had with the original study: what constitutes a &quot;field&quot;?

I may be a master at Chrome Javascript & rendering performance because I&#x27;ve spent a lot of team with the Chrome team understanding exactly how the rendering engine works.

I lived in Zurich and got to all sorts of places are Lake Zurich and Lake Luzern for hiking and the like.<p>I now live in New York City. I have visited a number of parts of the US. In most of the US you are utterly dependent on the automobile in a way that residents of other industrialized nations probably can&#x27;t quite comprehend.<p>I&#x27;ve stayed with friends in the Midwest who parked their car 8 feet from the front door of the their condo, drove to work where their car was pretty close to the office and often got food through drive throughs. They&#x27;d probably walk less than 500 yards a day.<p>Most places in the US aren&#x27;t just pro-automobile, they&#x27;re anti-pedestrian and anti-cyclist. Things like:<p>- Limited to no public transport<p>- Public transport that becomes unusable at certain hours<p>- Light changes at intersections that may stop a pedestrian for as much as 5 minutes<p>- Allowing cars to turn right at red lights. This is perhaps the most anti-pedestrian/cyclist law of all. The number of times I&#x27;ve been almost wiped out in this situation is insane.<p>- Low density housing.<p>Even some more pedestrian-friendly places like San Francisco still kinda suck (but SF is a lot better than anywhere else in the Bay Area).<p>NYC is a bit of a pedestrian mecca. As someone who can&#x27;t drive, I&#x27;ve never quite had the independence and freedom I have right now by living in NYC. Reasons include:<p>- Pedestrian-friendly light changes (you never have to wait more than about 30-45 seconds for a light change)<p>- Subway that runs 24x7 and frequently<p>- Cheap cabs<p>- No turning right at red lights. Some visitors to NYC don&#x27;t realize this is illegal in the five boroughs.<p>So now I live walking distance to work. The downside is that being able to do so is expensive as a single person and the domain of the wealthy for those with more than 1-2 kids.<p>The thing that really boggles my mind is how blase we as a society are to the 30,000+ people who die every year in the US in motor vehicle accidents [1].<p>This is the same number of fatalities as 10 9/11 attacks <i>every year</i>. The cult of the automobile simply defies reason.<p>There are a couple of points worth making about walking as exercise:<p>1. Some is far, far better than none. You need some exercise simply for proper functioning of your body; and<p>2. Walking, and exercise in general, is not the primary solution to obesity. According to a calculator, a 200 lb man burns 120 calories by walking 1 mile in 20 minutes. Not a brisk pace at all. A 12oz can of soda has ~140 calories in it.<p>Now the relationship between calorific intake and weight gain or loss is complex and somewhat controversial in some circles but, generally speaking, if you consume more calories than you burn you will tend to gain weight and if you consume less than you burn you will tend to lose weight. The body makes some effort to maintain homeostasis so minor changes may result in no change at all.<p>Exercise certainly helps but diet tends to be the far bigger problem.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in...</a>",1406774629

While it is incontrovertable that some people do indeed have an intrinsic gift for certain activities, I think we should not lose sight of the apparent fact that just about anyone will do better when this view is at least not assigned greater importance than the need to put in a good effort. Lest we unintentionally start sending messages something like &quot;Oh, well you&#x27;re obviously not as gifted as Michael Jordan at Basketball, so you should probably not even bother learning the game at all.&quot; That&#x27;s an intentionally exaggerated example to get my point across, but particularly when it comes to early childhood development I believe we should not underestimate the effect of even a stray word of encouragement/discouragement.

8112154,comment,8111989,8111989,1,0,s4sharpie,,,"The author rightly points out that there is, dare I say, a disruption in traditional career paths.  Consulting/Banking/Large Corporate was 20/30 years ago seen as a key entry point for any career.  And in that there was an informal contract: start with us, work hard, and we will promote you internally and externally so that you can move into the next big thing.  This ultimately depended on said big bank/corporate/consulting house continuing an inexorable growth to support everyone growing.<p>Today, big banks/corporates/consulting firms now no longer offer that same social contract (they would argue they do, but they don&#x27;t - with few exceptions).  You are expendable and most firms would be happy for you to stay where you are (same role, same salary) and if you want to change, go find it outside the company.<p>So in complete agreement with the author that a big name brand name won&#x27;t necessarily move your career forward.<p>But extrapolating that further, what I am now seeing is that this first choice can irreparably hamper your choices down the road.  Following the &#x27;traditional&#x27; and &#x27;secure&#x27; path of a big company/consulting firm etc is now seen as the safe, risk free, dare I say boring choice.  If you have any intention of being in a risky role (ie startup/entrepreneur) the signalling from a big comfortable riskless name on your resume may do more harm than good.<p>I review candidates for roles in a fast paced tech startup.  If I have a choice between someone from say Microsoft and someone from a failed startup, everything else being equal, I will pick the startup man/woman every time.",1406773742

As you heat a normal room, it will expel air in order to maintain constant pressure, and similarly, as you allow a room to cool, outside air will enter again to keep the pressure constant.<p>There was an article about this in the American Journal of Physics [1, 2] a couple years back, and the authors calculated that heating a room from 273K to 300K (32F to 80F) causes it to expel about 10 percent of the air inside it.<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the authors don&#x27;t comment on how relevant this is to the question of when to turn your heater off. The fact that allowing a room to cool draws in cold air from the outside means that the practice is worse than you would naively think, but I don&#x27;t know when if ever that actually suggests leaving the heater on a constant setting.

I cannot afford to go study computer science but I have motivation to learn on my own.<p>I would be SO happy if I could do some entry-level programming. I&#x27;d be grateful for all the boring stuff programmers complain about - I&#x27;d even take smaller salary just to have experience (but I need to earn to pay for rent).<p>I just don&#x27;t know how to do it. I&#x27;m feeling kind of scared and depressed about life.<p>TL;DR I really want to become programmer but I am worried it&#x27;s too late for me.",1406772471

I&#x27;m comfortable with the coursework and am really enjoying it.<p>Where I feel lost is in my spare time. I have a bookmarks folder with about 200 links to articles, resources, videos, etc. I&#x27;m incredibly overwhelmed with the amount of &#x27;stuff&#x27; out there; languages, frameworks, tools, and so on. I feel a bit lost every time I sit down at my laptop and try to do something productive.<p>My short-term goal is to secure an internship/junior position in Europe (Poland) over my next summer break (I live in Aus).<p>I&#x27;m looking for some ideas on what to do in my spare time to make myself the most competitive for an entry-level position.<p>With only a few months of experience I haven&#x27;t really been exposed to enough different areas of development to say I want to work in X, Y or Z.<p>I&#x27;m suffering from the fact that pretty much everything interests me. Web dev, data analysis, machine learning, databases, and so on. I think that for me I need someone to pigeon-hole me into an area so that I can self-study in depth and get an internship in this area.<p>Would some more experienced developers offer some advice? Where did you start? Where would you have liked to start? What are some good ways to kick-off a successful development career?<p>I hope this wasn&#x27;t too much of a ramble. Cheers",1406772374

1901102,comment,1899929,1899929,0,0,abalashov,,,"I got fired personally by the CEO of a midsize company I was working for last time I was employed (I was, despite the size of the company, a direct report of his), for some combination of insubordination, chronically coming in late, and generally being a political nuisance. Amidst his litany of admonishments, he told me that I am one of those people who just needs to be running his own business.  At the time, I assumed that was sardonic and snarky;  I now realise he was genuinely prescient.<p>And so, after my 6th job in 3.5 years, I decided to do what I had been itching to do for the last 2 or 3 of them, but not had the balls to do, given the conventionality of the steady W-2 paycheck.  I've been running my VoIP consultancy for almost 36 months now and I am still here, growing steadily and slowly - but growing.  It's twice the work, half the money, but I'm a whole lot happier for it. I don't think I would be exaggerating to say that I needed someone to kick me in the ass and push me out of the plane, or I might not have gone down this path for quite a while yet.<p>Ironically, and pleasantly, the same CEO sent me a lot of consulting work, especially early on, and continues to be an important relationship for me.  When I occasionally come in, he shakes my hand and says it's nice to see me and asks, ""how's business?""",1289667563

1901075,comment,1900863,1900990,0,0,jeromec,,,"The bank bailouts appear to be widely unpopular. I can only guess this is because people don't truly grasp what was happening, or what the alternative would have been. My congressman was one who initially voted against TARP, and I communicated to him that he needed to change his vote. Like most politicians he is not an expert in economics or finance, and he didn't take kindly to what was essentially the Bush administration ""telling us the sky was falling, and putting a gun to our heads."" But the sky <i>was</i> falling. The economy was in a free fall with millions of jobs being lost monthly, the stock market tanking, and credit markets -- a crucial cog in our economy -- freezing up. If congress had not acted the financial system would have collapsed. We would now be in a real depression. Imagine how bad people say the economy is now, and multiply that by about 100. I'm talking millions unemployed, homeless, tent cities, crime, and a feeling of hopelessness pretty much everywhere. <i>That</i> would have been the alternative to not bailing out the banks. In that context I don't think many would oppose the bailouts.<p>Now, was the system set up incorrectly where we could end up in such a mess? Yes. But that wasn't the fault of any one politician or group of politicians at any one time. The problems leading up to the crisis built up in different ways over time. The financial reform President Obama has pushed through addresses some of these issues, for example, by allowing the government the power to break apart and unwind large ""too big to fail"" type entities without bailing them out with taxpayer funds. When you look at it this way, Congress and both the outgoing and incoming administrations did do what was best for the country, even if unpopular on the surface. This doesn't even get into the fact that a lot of that initial money has been, and continues to be paid back, and in some cases even turns a profit.",1289666357

The remainder is almost entirely stuff that I'd prefer to get electronically and, if the USPS were to disappear, I feel confident I would.<p>The answer to that has to do with economic issues. Once upon a time (and I have not seen the numbers in years) 3rd class mail (what you can junk, and is now officially called Standard) actually carried its own way, and supported the cost-basis for First Class mail.<p>The reason(s) were varied, but had to do with the number of times a piece of mail had to be handled/sorted. Properly prepared Standard mail, had to be individually handled less than 2 times. Much of it was handled once (by the letter carrier). Standard mail arrives at the USPS dropoff already is pre-sorted by carrier route, and potentially by carrier order of travel. The  mailers get a reduced rate, but not as much as it actually saves the USPS.<p>Getting rid of Standard Mail would actually increase cost of First Class. Standard Mail is advertising, and if they didn't advertise to you one way, they would just do it another.<p>My beef is less with Standard Mail, and more with political mail.<p>> So I'd like to hear arguments for the continuing subsidy and existence of the USPS, but I wouldn't personally cry any tears if it were abolished tomorrow.<p>USPS delivers (in one way or the other) to every point of presence in the USA.

1901045,comment,1900863,1900863,0,0,bluedevil2k,,,"If you think about the USPS as an independent corporation, it would be crazy to think about these results:  a government approved monopoly, massive tax-shields (no business income tax, no property tax on post offices).  Then, you contrast that with their one big weakness - they can't set their own prices.  Congress sets the postage rates.  Talk about an incredibly inefficient way to run a business - seems a great counterpoint to anyone who thinks government should be more involved with business.<p>Here's a quick and drastic solution to the USPS problem.\n1)  Give them the ability to set their own prices.  They have competition in the form of UPS and FedEx for large packages delivered to your door.  Chances are those prices wouldn't change.  The rate for a stamp would potentially double.  Is that a bad thing?  Seriously, what percentage of the stuff you get in the mail is actually useful?  10%?  5%?  Yes, there are some businesses who depend on cheap mail, but in effect the US taxpayer is subsidizing their business then.  It's no different than the US bailing out the car companies in that regard.  This price increase would probably decrease mail volume considerably.\n2)  Reduce delivery to 3 days a week.  Would anyone complain about this?  How many people even check their mail every single day without fail?  Again, this may hurt mail-based businesses, but they are already existing in an artificial business environment skewed by government subsidies.  Going from 6 days to 3 wouldn't cut costs 50%, but I think 20-25% cut in costs is reasonable to expect, considering the volume decrease.<p>These two things would quickly make the USPS profitable.  As everyone here has pointed out, it's not 1980 any more.  There's better way to transmit information from one person to another.",1289665673

Python and Ruby are both advertised as 'interpreted' languages and most programmers realize that what you do with them is write a script, which you then feed into a Python or Ruby interpreter. Many Lisp implementations are advertised as compiled and when people think of compiled languages, they think of C, C++, Paschal, or any one of dozens of languages where you write a program, feed it to a compiler (either through a build tool or straight) and you end up with an executable file that you can double click on or type in at the command line. When I first started with Lisp I expected something similar, and was surprised.<p>Lisp isn't really designed with either the standard interpreted language workflow, or the standard compiled language workflow, in mind. It's workflow is actually superior in a low of ways, but it's non-obvious to non-lispers how to make a deliverable.<p>Actually, it's a huge problem in some ways, as there is no standard way of delivering OSS Lisp software on Linux, or Unix systems. The few OSS Lisp projects there are usually really on the presence of a specific Lisp implementation and bundle any Lisp dependencies in themselves, which when you are familiar with how the rest of the Linux/Unix OSS community is usually packaged and delivered, feels really inefficient. One case in point is StumpWM, a Lisp based Linux window manager that gained some interest a while back. It was actually pretty neat, but there were at least three or four ways to install it and none meshed completely with whatever packaging system your distro was using. I can tell you with some certainty that that hurt its adoption compared to tiled window managers written in C.<p>I could go on, And deal with everything you said, but I'll stop here. It think it's suffice to say, Lisp is different and people haven't figured out how to reconcile Lisp with their expectations (right or wrong) or the rest of the world.",1289664322

3195698,comment,3193103,3193103,1,0,saturdaysaint,,,"This is blowing one element of design way out of proportion. I'm not a huge fan of brown leather, but to me, iCal is much easier to look at and functionally clear than Google Calendar, and part of this has to do with the use of texture.<p>When I open iCal (in the cloud or desktop), my focus rests naturally on the actual calendar because the texturing puts all the settings in the background.  I like that the calendar itself is elegantly centered on the screen.  I like that it has only settings I'm likely to use and that menus I use less the calendar selection column) are completely out of the way.<p>I don't have any problem using Google Calendar, but it's flatness annoys me.  The calendar is lumped into the bottom of the screen, which is kind of an odd de-emphasis of the most used element of the app.  The banner and many controls I don't use all the time have the same dark hue as the current week.  Search is disproportionately (for my calendar usage, anyway) prioritized in terms of screen space.  The whole left column (with the garish ""create"" button and a mini calendar) is basically useless.<p>Yeah, Apple needs to go easy on the leather (surely <i>something</i> could be more consonant with that silk texture), but ultimately Google has a lot more to learn from iCal than vice versa.   And I think iCal actually shows, albeit imperfectly, that texture does have its place.",1320407966

Surprisingly, this also makes them good at certain aspects of high-level planning. I suspect that the current CEO Tim Cook has an excellent systemizing (as well as negotiating) mind, which would partly explain his great deeds in the supply chain operations.<p>Some people would argue that it was Wozniak's engineering mind that made him not want to pursue management. I would argue that the engineering mind is actually quite useful in management and that a lot of business leaders possess it (think Bill Gates). My hypothesis is that if Wozniak became as ambitious and controlling as Jobs was after the two met, the pair either would have fallen apart violently at some point or would have created an empire the size of Microsoft early on.",1320407946

ORM-wed code is a nightmare, 3-5 years on. When the ORM trends have shifted to something else, and the original people who implemented it or selected the framework is long gone.<p>Ill take a messy system with hand coded SQL over that any day, atleast then you have a chance to refactor.<p>Also, its not that hard to implement a pluggable data access layer (that uses hand written SQL). The most important thing is to keep your RDBMS data model separate from your application model. These two will be intermingled when you are using a ORM, in my experience.",1320407690
3195692,comment,3194702,3195155,2,0,vilya,,,"I'm not sure where the article got that 50 Mb/sec figure from, but it sounds a bit low. Uncompressed, it's more like 50 Mb per <i>frame</i> - 1.5 Gb/sec (4096x2160, 3 channels, each channel is 16 bits, up to 30 frames/sec).<p>According to their tech specs page* there are two compression options: 18:1 and 3:1. The former gets it down to about 84 Mb/sec, but it's difficult to know what kind of a quality hit you'll be taking. With the latter it's still 500 Mb/sec.<p>Film-makers generally want to capture source footage at the highest quality possible so I'd guess most will film at the 3:1 compression level. If that assumption holds, 2 hours of footage is approximately 3.5 Tb of data.<p>That is still a fairly manageable amount of data though. For comparison, The Tale of Despereaux - an animated movie which came out in 2008 and started production several years before that - filled up a 192 Tb disk cluster.<p>* <a href=""http://www.red.com/products/scarlet#product-tech-specs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.red.com/products/scarlet#product-tech-specs</a><p>Edit: I think I might have made some incorrect assumptions about the REDCODE raw format, so my figures above are probably wrong.

In short, Apple works with its upstream suppliers to secure the ability to manufacture and transport then dispatch tens of millions of gadgets from scratch(read: silicon and aluminum) in weeks and maintain the quality and price point. So many things could go wrong and Apple would be left with nothing to sell. for example iPad's channel inventory is only 4-6 weeks deep, and that's for the big box retailers, for Apple's own brick and mortar store it's even less. It works for Apple instead of disastrous through unexpected manufacturing difficulties and natural disasters or accidents because of Tim Cook's ironclad control.",1320406631

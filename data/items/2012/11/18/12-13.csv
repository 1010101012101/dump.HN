Due to hardware problem, the computer can connect e.g. to microsmft.com instead of microsoft.com. The data gathered by the researcher suggests those kind of bugs happen also in web caches etc. thus increasing the number of affected users.<p>In practice, the privacy problems coming from this are rather limited (unless you send private stuff in URL), since in majority of cases, you'll not be sending domain cookies for the original domain if it resolved to the bitsquat domain early. Anyway, it's still probably a thing not thoroughly thought of on a daily basis regarding security.",1353243518

Specifically outside observers punish insincerity (coerced or feigned apologies) more harshly than insensitivity (no apology) and in far greater degree than the wronged party punishes either.<p>So if there are third parties present, the best strategy is not to apologize unless you are fairly certain it will be viewed as sincere.  In the absence of a 3rd party, apology is the winning strategy regardless of sincerity.<p>I found it interesting that the recipient of the apology is made to feel better not because the wrongdoer cares enough to apologize but because it is an opportunity to be seen by others and affirm one's self-image as magnanimous and gracious by accepting.

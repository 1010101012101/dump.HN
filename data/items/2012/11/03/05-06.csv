4736024,comment,4730535,4735314,5,0,fdr,,,"It is a practical problem. The presumption is that the unusual license makes the language's implementation less amenable to survival.<p>I can't justify a reason to absorb that much risk over the lifetime of maintaining programs written in the Shen language, running on the Shenlanguage.org implementation, which is presumed to be the best. The relatively new implementation is hard enough to swallow, but understandably completely necessary and unavoidable. Considering the typically interested audience of advanced static typing include staid system programmers looking for an edge in correctness in systems that take a long time to build and last a long time afterwards, that's a pretty weighty consideration. It is from this viewpoint I evaluate my dependencies.<p>So, sorry. I don't think my analysis -- which is something you seem to sneer at -- is without a justified dimension. To be fair, I sneer at the licensing in turn, so all is even.<p>Hopefully, the authors might understand why so many people may be so hesitant to invest in their platform, doing all the hard work of writing, debugging, and <i>maintaining</i> ports and libraries on such a foundation, as they seem so inclined to ask people to do. Even if the existing authors did all that themselves, proposal of new investment in the platform in organizations at arm's length from Lambda Associates would raise some eyebrows. I could see enormous organizations (like the US DoD or Boeing) being interested.<p>I'd compare Lambda Associates (the Shen author umbrella organization) as a less entrenched Adacore as things stand.<p>Given that I don't feel they solve their purported problem anyway (divergent language implementations are not so much a fragmenting force as multiple libraries with inadequate resources doing the same-ish thing, a problem virtually un-treatable by any policy or license) I'd really hope they'll one day see fit to just not be strange with respect to licensing, and change their mind. The observation of another poster -- that this may ironically increase fragmentation, because someone fascinated with the ideas in the language but not the bizarre license -- may be inclined to make something kind-of-not-quite-like Shen rather than contributing to the existing artifact.",1351922154

Conversion is very easy number to measure, but extremely difficult to increase. I'd rather have a 10% open-rate with 25% conversion than 50% open-rate with 1% conversion. A high conversion-rate allows the company to discover their customers and their behavior. Increasing conversion is an art-form.

This is unfair to people that don't live in the swing states.<p>In the popular model, it's a bit subtle.  At first, you think ""well everyone's vote counts equally so everyone's concerns get counted according to the proportion of the constituents with those concerns.""  But this is not correct when you get down to the details.<p>If you're a candidate, you have to spend your resources in the most efficient way possible.  Politicians do this (spend resources) by paying for messaging, spending their time campaigning in person and with volunteers/staffers, and by adopting policy positions (this is a resource in the political landscape).<p>In the electoral college model, the best return on your time, money, and issue consideration is found in the swing states, because everywhere else you have basically zero probability of success, which cannot be balanced out by any weight that electoral votes afford.<p>In the popular model, the best return is to target the largest population possible.  People get divvied up into geographical regions no matter what---be it by local news network, regional speaking venue, or major political issue---and it's to these regions that our votes then become divided.  In the popular model, the only places worth considering are those places with the largest populations, that still stand a chance of being easy to target with a single message, TV ad, or speaking appearance.  If you're in a rural town, a candidate coming to speak to you only gets to speak to you, not to the nearest million voters.  But in a city, the candidate that comes to you does get an audience of a million or more.  So in the popular model, candidates will only bother to work for the concerns of those who live in population centers.<p>You get skewed either way.  Personally, I think skewing toward regions with lots of people, even if they may not be the overall majority, is the best thing to do, but that's just my opinion, I don't have an optimal solution.<p>The problem is that ""optimal"" means that everyone's concerns get addressed in an equal manner, not necessarily that everyone gets an equivalent vote.  The game theory involved is subtle and the emotions on all sides even more so.",1351921210

4735995,comment,4729068,4729068,1,0,cuspy,,,"Those who argue that Chomsky singularly ""pioneered"" or ""revolutionized"" the study of formal language should thoroughly read the book ""Linguistics and the Formal Sciences"" by Marcus Tomalin. It is a great historical account of the development of this particular strain of formal linguistic study. Knowing more about the intellectual environment and his predecessors and contemporaries helps to erode the mythology of Chomsky as the sole revolutionary catalyst in the development of formal language theory. In fact the major principles of his classic theory of syntax can be thought of as fairly incremental developments from previous work. Many of the specific claims he is well known for had been made by others before.<p>As for his contributions to cognitive science, I think one side of the field simply feels that he is clinging to some outmoded notions of what Bayesian modeling can achieve in terms of explanatory power.<p>As a counterpoint, EVERYONE should read Andy Clark's beautifully written BBS paper ""Whatever Next?

4735969,comment,4735441,4735688,5,0,jilebedev,,,"Waiting an idea out does two important things. \n1. It ensures you're objective and clearheaded. There's no reason to value the thinking process of an euphorically happy man over a suicidally depressed one. Both are irrational. \n2. Humans are powered by emotions: love, hope. If an idea is strong enough to emotionally persist for 3 months, then it's a decent bet that the emotions will power the next 3 months also. \n3. After 3 months, it's possible to do a double-take, a gut-check. It's very difficult to do a proper gut-check in the heat of a moment. \n4. Most importantly, if an idea has persisted for 3 months, it is likely founded on some kernel of truth.<p>After 3 months, I generally take apart an idea over the course of days. I'll destroy it from every angle, and I'll show from as-simple-as-possible logic. Every single sentence has to be sound logic, and every tiny nook and crany needs to be explored.<p>The first three months are for my emotions to settle and solidify. The next 1-2 weeks are for me to have a logical, impartial, and objective argument with the idea. A portion of it is to assume the role of a 12 year old internet troll and absolutely assault the idea from every angle. There cannot remain even a single facet I am unsure of, or uncertain of, or cannot backup with facts or logic stemming from facts.<p>If it stands after this, then it becomes second nature to begin. There isn't any giddy enthusiasm, but there also isn't any hopeless depression when encountering an unknown. The fight has been fought, all that remains is execution. Starting is weary, and execution is tame. There is no gut-sinking defeated feeling once the euphoria wears off: there's just a logical argument - written down - for what needs to be done, and why.<p>This is how I've made some of the most difficult decisions in my life, and it has so far worked. It protracts the decision making process into months, and that's inefficient and sad. But it is guaranteed to work for me. This is how I have lost a very significant amount of weight, and how I have stopped smoking.<p>A part of it is, for me at least, to acknowledge that I dislike change intensly. I don't think I'm unique in that regard among humans, but it's something I feel passionate about changing. If baby steps is what's required, then baby steps it'll be.<p>My next goal is to begin running. I'm in the first month of the fermentation stage: the passion to start running 3 times a week has been building within me over the last 3-6 months, but I've gotten serious about it last month. Now the 3 month waiting period begins. \nDuring those 3 months, I'll begin kicking things around my head. \nJust this morning, it occurred to me that I'll need to keep a precise schedule, and if I lax from it, then I'll miss a day, and this makes me very worried. I want to be disciplined about it. I'm not sure how I'll solve that - perhaps run in the afternoon? \nIt's something I'm going to work out by the end of January.",1351919937

(Glitch?)<p>Debugging is one of the problems with FRP/signals, or functional code in general. No one has come up with a good dataflow debugger yet, and it might not even be viable. The best you can do is interpose ""probes"" on your code like you would take measurements with an oscilloscope. Disclosure: I did my dissertation on signals (object-oriented ones to be precise), and am a bit disillusioned with it.<p>On the other hand, the argument from the declarative community is that you don't need to debug your code.<p>A better alternative to FRP/signals might be immediate mode user interfaces. Since they are conceptually called on every frame, you get the benefits of FRP while still being able to debug in the old way. On the other hand, they are quite inefficient, though I think we could play some tricks with technology to make them better (memoize, refresh blocks of computations only as needed via dependency tracing).",1351919858

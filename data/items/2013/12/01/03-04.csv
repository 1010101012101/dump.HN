Ben made a mistake but to single out and threaten him like that in public would surely alienate him further.<p>This entire situation has gotten extremely out of hand. It shows how activists can turn into extremists when faced with an adversary.

6826002,comment,6824879,6825568,6,0,landryraccoon,,,"I have to disagree with your characterization of people in suburbs. The only anecdote of trusting behavior given in the article was of a rural farmer in an isolated area - and it was given in contrast to people from urban New York or New Jersey coming up and being amazed about it.<p>Here&#x27;s another hypothesis - tribal or rural cultures will be more trusting by nature. Human beings are naturally paranoid but NOT of each other. If you are competing with other species and the environment for survival, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to view your own species as a threat. Indeed, it benefits your family or tribe if you all cooperate. However, in densely populated urban environments, your competition is all human beings. If you are metaphorically eaten or taken advantage of, it will be by another human. It&#x27;s much less likely in a city that you will die because of exposure, or weather or a wild animal. Thus, because the threat is from people, you must be more wary of people.<p>I&#x27;m not super confident about this of course - it&#x27;s probably both simplistic and wrong on a few levels, but I think whatever the answer is, it&#x27;s not just that urban people are trusting and rural people are paranoid.",1385870048

But the moment the Indian Government a$$holes (who have eaten up more than 10000X that amount which a Mangalyan costs) and their media toots start projecting this achievement of engineers as their own &quot;moment of glory&quot; and a proof towards India becoming a global superpower, everything falls flat on the face.<p>There should be no doubt that poverty IS the biggest challenge for us (I am an Indian) to work on, and there are people with achievements in rural tech to help people over with just that.

Most streets would do fine, provided you don&#x27;t have to scale nearby structures, such as tall buildings in NYC.<p>- You can fly airplanes autonomously too.  In fact, because airplanes can coast without expending energy, they can fly much higher than multicopters which need constant power output to remain aloft.<p>- Tighter control of multicopters means they are easily maneuvered, but you can also take high-resolution images with airplanes.<p>- US regulations would restrict what a pilot can do in the US;  regardless of where the craft was designed or manufactured.<p>- DJI appears to be based in China, but Parrot SA (AR Drone) is French and 3D Robotics (the company behind the open-source ArduCopter) is based in San Diego.

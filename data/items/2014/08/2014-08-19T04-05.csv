8196075,comment,8195223,8195223,2,0,ihnorton,,,"Details are scarce on the website and in the articles I&#x27;ve found, but this seems similar to the 4S project Toshiba has been working on for over a decade [1,2]. Between the full-size plants they&#x27;ve built in Japan, and their acquisition of Westinghouse, Toshiba owns a respectable chunk of the nuclear engineering talent and experience on the planet. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have gone much further [3] than the last time I read about it.<p>What is UPower going to do differently?<p>Nuclear engineering strikes me as one of those areas where exuberant inexperience and simulation prowess are not selling points. Youngsters work ok for software because (1) business inexperience can be offset by deep technical experience, and then rapid product iterations - both made possible by low entry barriers; and (2) screwing up (most) software has negligible negative externalities. Neither of those apply to nuclear engineering.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba_4S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba_4S</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.toshiba.com/tane/products_4s.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toshiba.com/tane/products_4s.jsp</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/advanced/4s.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/advanced/4s.html</a>",1408424339
8196074,comment,8195730,8196020,3,0,dmkolobov,,,"The authors opinion about the misogyny of the speaker&#x27;s trivialization does not carry nearly the amount of weight as legal prohibitions on hate speech. I do not think it&#x27;s valid to dismiss a community&#x27;s right to enforce a code of conduct to protect its members within its bounds. Maybe it&#x27;s my own opinions, but ideally that is how positive social change is implemented. I do not think trivialization of concerns about hate speech would fly in most liberally minded circles either. If you are defending nuanced discussion about the value of rape culture, then I think there are better examples of nuance than this joke.<p>I think a lot of good would come if we stopped using the word &quot;censorship&quot;, and just responded to what people actually had concerns with. Censorship is distinct from a dude stating his opinions, and encouraging others to agree with him.<p>(Edit): * defending nuanced discussion about the value of rape culture as a concept",1408424205

8196068,comment,8187097,8187244,1,0,gw666,,,"@lutusp, I&#x27;m sorry for whatever experiences have led you to such a negative opinion of therapy; I&#x27;m sure you have very valid reasons to feel that way.<p>You&#x27;re right, therapy is not a science, but it is doing its best to learn as much as possible about the human condition and to apply what it has learned to improve human lives.<p>In its defense, it&#x27;s barely over 100 years old. Where was physics 100 years after its origins? Chemistry? Medicine? When therapy started, all Freud and Jung had to work with was observation of a person&#x27;s visible and verbal behavior...and dreams. They did what they could with the tools that were available. Since then, we have roughly a century of observation, as well as research that has attempted to be as scientifically rigorous as it could be. And in the past 20 years or so, we&#x27;ve finally gained the first handful of technologies that have given us some <i>basic</i> data about what the brain is actually doing. We&#x27;re still just beginning.<p>Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re up against. The human brain is the most complex system in the universe, a crazy quilt of impulses that has accumulated from the blind forces of million years of evolution. Can you imagine how difficult it is to design an experiment that controls for unwanted factors? Now, add in the restrictions dictated by ethical concerns <i>and</i> the unimaginable range of human behavior. Is it any wonder that progress is so slow?<p>So, given how little we know, by what right do we presume to practice? You could ask the same of a physician from 200, or even 2,000, years ago. The answer would be the same: &quot;Because people are suffering, and we have things we can do that have a good track record of reducing that suffering.&quot;<p>As a therapist, I am doing more than providing &quot;benefit from ordinary conversation.&quot; See my reply to @nostrademons for details. It is well established, through numerous studies across the last 70 years, that measurable benefits are to be had from talking to a therapist who is non-judgemental, who communicates back to you an emotional understanding of your experience, and who is there to provide--as much as is humanly possible--unconditional support for you in your situation.<p>Changing human behavior is very, very difficult. But it can be done, and therapists of all sorts--psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, and other licensed counselors--have valuable skills to offer.<p>Thank you for listening.",1408424012

You understand the difference, but unfortunately there is a fundamental misunderstanding for the general public that a reactor could function like a bomb.  There just isn&#x27;t the energy density to do that.<p>There was physical damage to structures at Fukushima but that didn&#x27;t cause any real damage outside the plant or releases.  The releases were leaks elsewhere (which were still not huge compared to natural radiation levels).<p>Chernobyl was due to a reactor literally geared for instability (search rbmk void fraction for details) in the Soviet union.  It had no containment around the reactor.  So a basic structure around the reactor would crumble with an explosion.  But it wouldn&#x27;t contain that much regardless since it wasn&#x27;t designed to, and they frankly were arrogant and didn&#x27;t care much about safety precautions.<p>As to the plenty of damage from  Chernobyl, here&#x27;s the facts: it has been highly studied over almost 30 years, it is a nature preserve, people who refused to evacuate still live there healthily, and they still operate a reactor on that site.  Here&#x27;s an article which examined and summarized the largest and most reputable medical studies on the Chernobyl aftermath.

Usually, these decisions are so ingrained in the system that nobody questions them, and even if they did, changing them requires the cooperation of many different people or even departments and no individual contributor has that much authority.

We used mechanical (Olivetti?) typewriters (electric typewriters were for the older students who did typing as an elective). Even at the time, we found the whole thing archaic, as many of us had computers and printers, but obviously the school curriculum didn&#x27;t move forward at the speed of technology. And mechanical keyboards aren&#x27;t romantic when the typewriters and keys jam up and/or break in weird ways. Carriage returns weren&#x27;t automatic either, as they are on the Hanxwriter app...you needed to manually move the lever on the left.<p>After a rocky start (because I refused to cheat and look at the keys), and two years of typing exercises, I found it was a useful skill, and, even now the keyboard &quot;gets out of the way&quot; when I type on any device.<p>I wonder if there are long-term benefits to formal typing education, vs picking things up, along the way, and if it is still taught formally at school.<p>As for the app, my first impression is that it provides an <i>ersatz</i> sanitised version of a real mechanical typewriter.

I find it worrying how nonchalantly the range of what is considered a transgression is being expanded in feminist circles from fairly universally agreed upon beginnings (rape) to ever higher meta-levels. First, jokes about rape and presumably any discussion that suggests nuances within the range of what has come to be included under the umbrella of &quot;rape&quot;, both of which are at least a significant component of what they refer to as &quot;rape culture&quot;, were included in it - and now, apparently, so have been jokes about this concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; and presumably any discussion that would involve statements to the effect of &quot;A is a not particularly serious instance of rape culture in comparison to B&quot; . It doesn&#x27;t take many steps of this sort of generalisation to arrive at a closure of the form &quot;you must not question X, and you must not question the prohibition of questioning X, etc.&quot;, which basically amounts to the punchline of those &quot;the worst thing about censorship is [CENSORED]&quot; bumper stickers.<p>One of the reasons the fairly commonplace legal prohibitions against hate speech are not perceived as censorship is that it is perfectly legal to discuss those prohibitions in most countries that have them. This arrangement has been very serviceable as a compromise so far; I can&#x27;t help but be very unsettled if large traditionally liberal segments of society are cannibalised by a prohibitory movement that deems it insufficient.",1408422343

Our founders have met and spent time with executives from nearly every domestic utility company and all of them have different types of power in their portfolio.

There are all kinds of corner cases and special considerations that you have to take into account.  People have written huge tomes about that exact topic detailing exactly why it&#x27;s a hard problem and why you&#x27;re probably not going to solve it correctly by accident.  You&#x27;re far more likely to introduce a memory leak than to make your class exception safe on the first try.  That&#x27;s my point.  That&#x27;s why C++ is overly cumbersome unless you ignore most of its capabilities, like exceptions.  And that&#x27;s why you can simply ignore C++ and not miss out on much.

10838069,comment,10835860,10837322,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"> <i>would only estimate a 3-5x reduction in fleet size</i><p>10x is admittedly bullish. I expect 4 to 7x within 20 years, <i>i.e.</i> 3 to 4 product cycles. But 10x is more reasonable than it seems at face value.<p>Let&#x27;s use Manhattan to illustrate. Another HN user (wadenick) kindly provided [1] some references I&#x27;d like to point to. Car ownership across the United States stands at 81% of households [2]. In Manhattan it&#x27;s 23% [3]. Manhattan has roughly fewer than 1/3 the number of cars as the rest of America. This is partly why there are only 39 gas stations in Manhattan (down from 60 in 2004) [4]. Repair shops, too, are fewer and further in between. Many are owned by taxi operators for their fleets&#x27; use only.<p>Uber pays 75% of its earnings to its drivers. How much cheaper could a driverless be? 50% less? How would that tilt our 23% figure? All it takes is half of Manhattan&#x27;s car-owning households to switch for Manhattan to hit a 7-fold reduction in car ownership from present-day America.<p>Everywhere isn&#x27;t Manhattan. Density matters. Less-dense locales will need to accept some combination of higher wait times, higher prices or lower rates of fleet reduction. That said, the scaling economics are nearly identical. Fleets will be cheaper than individually-owned self-driving cars because they can more efficiently use their down time. This, in turn, makes individually car ownership more expensive (by degrading retail-servicing infrastructure and supply chains). That, in turn, makes fleet usage more desirable and so on.<p>The degree to which this happens may vary. But at its lower bound, I&#x27;d posit 4x and at its higher bound over 10. Given that income and urban dwelling are correlated, and continue to increase in their correlation, that bodes badly for the edge-case rural families demanding high degrees of simultaneity at a price even remotely approaching what it costs to maintain a small garage of cars today.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10837732"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10837732</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20140209114811/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.VEH.NVEH.P3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20140209114811/http://data.worldb...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nycedc.com/blog-entry/new-yorkers-and-cars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nycedc.com/blog-entry/new-yorkers-and-cars</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/say-goodbye-manhattans-gas-stations-heres-map/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wnyc.org/story/say-goodbye-manhattans-gas-station...</a>",1451937467

10838063,comment,10836236,10836236,0,0,Bahamut,,,"There are some slight inaccuracies here, such as file size reporting - Angular 2 is fat at the moment only because it is bundling the whole kitchen instead of just the one piece that is the library itself. The Angular 1 number also is off too - this link is giving me 52.8 KB for example (minified + gzipped): <a href=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.0-rc.0/angular.min.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.0-rc.0/a...</a> (all numbers I remember seeing for angular 1 were around 120 KB IIRC). I&#x27;d suspect all the other numbers are off too, but I haven&#x27;t investigated.<p>There is a strong argument against doing what JSX does in moving the HTML to JS - you allow developers to fall into the trap of creating complex conditional DOM that is hard to read without a disciplined team (if statements all over the place with imperative DOM construction for example). Neither approach of JSX or Angular&#x27;s templating (or any other similar system to either) are without its warts, and this falls into an opinion discussion without real winners excepting for however a particular team prefers their templating.<p>One thing that wasn&#x27;t discussed but that may come into play - the performance numbers out there for Angular 2 currently is extremely impressive. Optimized Angular 2 code is generally performing at about 2x the rate of other frameworks/libraries out there for UI rendering/repainting, and unoptimized Angular 2 code is performing at roughly the same parity as optimized React code (although optimized/unoptimized React code performs very similarly in many situations, which is a huge benefit of React).<p>I&#x27;m personally on the Angular side of the fence, I prefer the more declarative style to avoid the imperative DOM construction, but I could work with either (and have worked/am working with both) if they are done right. Both are impressive libraries though, and both have strong merits - at the end of the day, it comes down to how your team works, and what they&#x27;re productive with. Both libraries are bringing excellent changes to how we do things in the frontend...I just wish tooling was there in maturity, that seems to be the greater pain point currently.",1451937414

Many people would pay for the privilege of a private ride (like they do with Uber/Lyft now).<p>If car subscriptions services succeed and are nearly ubiquitous, the personal-freedom symbolism of car ownership will degrade.<p>Then, if people want to own a car as a status symbol, they will probably be better served by a more expensive one anyway, the same way people buy other status symbols (rose-gold iPhones, etc).

Ok, take a pointer to your bytes, cast it to a pointer to integers of the right size, and you&#x27;re done.<p>Oh wait.. he wants to do it without &quot;raw memory&quot;, whatever that means?

(No, I have never hit a cyclist.)<p>Here&#x27;s a starter list of the basic problems with cyclist behavior:<p>1. Not taking even the simplest steps to be visible or safe.  Install a lamp!  Wear clothes that aren&#x27;t pitch black at night!  Position yourself where cars will see you instead of &quot;hiding&quot; off to the side!<p>2. Outright ignoring road rules.  Yes, cyclists MUST stop at STOP signs and they MUST not go through red lights (unless a sign says they can follow pedestrian lights).  And yet, every <i>single</i> day, I see multiple cyclists doing what can only be described as &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot;.<p>3. Exceeding boundaries.  No, you may not ride side-by-side with someone and take up twice the space and cramp the traffic lane.  Yes, you are still a jerk for &quot;cutting off&quot; someone even if you do it with a bicycle.  I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re approaching another cyclist and want to pass, that doesn&#x27;t give you the right to shove yourself in front of a car to do so; wait a while!<p>4. Not using side roads.  A great way for cyclists to stay safe is to minimize the traffic that they actually interact with.  Cyclists DO NOT have to use main roads all the time.  In my area, there are <i>miles</i> of parallel side streets that go all the same places as main roads, yet cyclists clog up the busy roads and leave the side streets empty!<p>5. Forcing everyone to go their speed.  Many times a week I see a cyclist squeeze in front of two cars and make them go 15 mph for a mile, instead of waiting 2 seconds to let them go first.  If you&#x27;re going to use a slow-moving method of transportation on a highway, you should have the basic decency to at least put yourself in the most considerate part of the queue where possible.",1451936760

He got people to surface their problems at the executive level, where before everyone hid the issues for fear it would be used as ammunition against them by fellow executives.<p>Mulally emphasised the core brands, and in fact wanted to ditch ALL the brands except for Ford. He got Ford to bring over the European models that were far superior to their equivalents in the USA. He brought the Mazda product development model to Ford, where the engineers and designers sit in the same room. He sped up implementation of Global Ford Production System, patterned in large part on the Toyota Production System. He worked with the UAW to decrease legacy costs by funding the VEBA (UAW run healthcare fund) and trading worker concessions for promises to keep production in the USA. He worked with suppliers to decrease costs and increase supplier satisfaction. He reduced the number of dealers.<p>When I say &quot;he&quot; did these things above, I mean he pushed for them.

No venture capital volume to speak of, so the few options left are either through academic or government grants (Germany&#x27;s Fraunhofer Institute is a good model here) or some foreign entities with bundles of cash looking for higher ROI.<p>* taxation reasons - under US tax code investing in startups from a taxable account is interesting (as an asset class) mainly because it&#x27;s taxed as long-term capital gain, and the shareholder can choose the timing of the tax event (it&#x27;s only taxable when sale of securities happened). With taxation rules changed, investors will re-crunch the numbers to judge the potential ROI as compared to risk, and perhaps some other asset classes (commodities, real estate, emerging market bonds, energy) will look more attractive.<p>As a side note, when people mean &quot;income inequality&quot; they typically imply better and more universal access to things like food, housing, health care and education. Perhaps the focus should be on making those cheaper and accessible, making the income portion irrelevant.

That is never the limit of what the physical hardware is capable of, its a number set on their outbound WAN routing servers to accept or deny going in or out to your IP address.<p>But if you did have a legal definition of Internet requiring unmodified traffic, ISPs selling Internet service would <i>have to</i>, by definition, provide <i>unlimited</i> bandwidth insofar as their physical links are capable of. Which might actually be <i>nice</i> - we already know coax is fully capable of pretty incredible speeds, and being able to push data as fast as you can onto that link would be invaluable.<p>Of course, that also means the ISP has no requirement to ever upgrade their routing hardware - they would just have cheap stuff running 100% full load 24/7. But then its a consumer choice what ISP you use and whose hardware is best for the money - more expensive ISPs would be offering better routing hardware that can handle higher traffic, and cheaper ones would do the opposite.

If you want to place one risky bet, that&#x27;s worth doing. If you want to place dozens of risky bets <i>on the same venture</i>, you&#x27;ll lose. (VCs know this, and place dozens of risky bets one per venture.) For instance, just about no startup will, or will be advised to, run on a nonstandard OS just in case there&#x27;s some secret sauce. There are certainly a few, but they have founders who believe firmly, a priori, that the secret sauce exists and the market hasn&#x27;t recognized it. ~Nobody says, &quot;Well, we built our system on AIX because nobody uses AIX so we figured we might get competitive advantage out of it.&quot;<p>2.

10837856,comment,10836949,10837318,0,0,zanny,,,"Every ISP selling tiers of speed, or even having a set speed at all, is modifying your traffic. The theoretical maximum throghput of a network link is often magnitudes higher than what you get - when you switch from 3Mb/s to 1Gb/s Google Fiber, Google is not changing <i>anything</i> physically, they are just setting a database entry on if you are paying customer to &quot;true&quot; and then their packet scheduler that controls how fast data goes to you and how much data they take from you changes the limits it sets.<p>But there are always limits, every ISP uses them, and to not modify traffic would be to create an... interesting online experience. It would mean sometimes you get incredible bandwidth while at others you get none because everyone else is saturating the lines fully. It means you can have long strings of dropped packets just because your outbound gateway server is overwhelmed, and it would mean backups in the network would build without respite and get worse over time because the traffic saturation will spread to all possible nodes and slow them down with overheating.<p>When ISPs build their networks out and setup the switches that connect their effective LAN of customers to the broader WAN they build around fixed amounts of total bandwidth everyone can use at once, and then often undercut that significantly because not everyone will be using all their speed at once. But the rate limiting means you can have predictable maxima bandwidth, whereas with uncapped speeds your up and down packet rates would vary wildly based on physical conditions.<p>That being said, I would much rather we <i>had</i> that. It would taking full advantage of our available networks, and we have some breakout great network scheduling tech like codel to better handle fully saturated pipes than back in the 90s when this all became standard. Routing would of course be more <i>expensive</i> - you would not only have to expect greater peaks of bandwidth usage by far, you would also need to build your routing infrastructure better to handle full load saturation for extended periods of time.<p>So I guess I mean I agree - unmodified traffic being the definition of &quot;Internet&quot; would be great. But my point is that we do not have anything close to that now.<p>PS: Is this not a symptom? The problem is, for Internet access, either extremely restricted access to wireless transmission (private ownership of radio wave frequency is <i>incredibly insanely stupid</i>) or private ownership of physical infrastructure wire into your house. In either case, competition is extremely limited if present at all, and the markets are saturated with giant national corporations who have enough capital assets to devour startups and corrupt politicians into biasing the market in their favor.<p>If anyone could start an ISP by hooking up their own servers to a coax line on one end and fiber on the other, or anyone could start a phone company by building a cellular tower in their back yard, this would not be a problem. I mean, it would be, but it would be the kind of moral and ethical problem software freedom is - the onus then falls on the consumer to give enough shits to not buy Comcast-SuperSpeed-Facebook-Only-Terrornet for $5 less than actual Internet. The problem then becomes... most people would not, because they aren&#x27;t using the Internet as global access to anyone anywhere, but as TV stations for Twitter and Facebook. But like I said, then it would not be a technical problem, but a social one, in the same way getting people to care about software freedoms is more about how nobody gives a shit than any particular barrier to entry for free software (besides IP as a whole incentivizing the creation of proprietary software, but thats a different rant).",1451935651

Because of some unrealistic gentleman generosity that only exists in Jane Austin novels?<p>>Would have hurt paul financially, of course, but far less than it probably has over the last 20+ years.<p>Maybe he felt maximizing his riches and spending like a loon wasn&#x27;t within his interests? Or that this wasn&#x27;t a good investment? I think its obvious now that the post-ipod world and post-baby boomer nostalgia period, etc means that music monetization for oldies is high, but at the time, records and tapes ruled, and their sales weren&#x27;t exactly inspiring for 60&#x27;s rock. Disco, New Wave, Punk, etc ruled at this time and the prospect for a big Beatles fan revival seemed low. The new CD format ramped things up a bit and obviously the digial music revolution happened, but to a conservative investor in 1976, well, those would have been very risky trades.<p>Its also worth noting that ATV bought the rights from Northern Songs for $17m in the late sixties. So just a few years later the negotiate priced went over $40m?  Triple the price? Of course, Yoko and Paul balked. In 2015 dollars we&#x27;re looking at close to $150m for publishing rights. That was unheard of.<p>Lastly, this is just publishing rights. My understanding is that other royalties were quite profitable for the remaining Beatles and their estates and getting back publishing rights wasn&#x27;t a high priority for them. All this hand wringing is interesting, but it didn&#x27;t stop them from getting incredibly wealthy. None of them were remotely in the poor house.<p>Of course, in England, the taxation for the top earners was something like 80% (more?), so amassing a fortune meant losing all but 20% of it instantly.  This probably helped Paul, a UK citizen, make his decision to not bid large on a potential big payout. Lets say he bought the catalog for $50m in 1976 or so and his net worth at the time was $200m. Now he&#x27;s down to $150m and lets say that investment brings in another $100m in twenty or thirty years. Great, he&#x27;s now back up to $170m post tax.  Still a $30m loss.",1451935641

If your non-covalent drug accidentally binds to something it shouldn&#x27;t, after a little while it&#x27;ll go on its merry way (assuming the kinetics aren&#x27;t awful). This means some side-effect regarding that protein it bound, but nothing permanent.<p>On the other hand if a covalent inhibitor hits something it shouldn&#x27;t, then that protein it hit is SOL, and gone until a new copy of it can be made. This could take a very long time in certain cases, causing much longer lasting effects.<p>As a result, side-effects with covalent drugs can be both more severe and more variable. This is one reason that although they are popular in some areas of lab biochemistry, they haven&#x27;t made as much of an impact in the broader clinic.<p>In this particular case, the specificity of the drug, the importance of the target to the disease mechanism, and the patient population all combine to make it viable.

It&#x27;s often much easier to learn by doing and product engineers define themselves by the product they&#x27;re trying to build.<p>Plus, software got so much easier to build.

Do you go broader in order to save on team size? An engineer/designer means you can skip a design hire.

People can have more autonomy because you can develop the skills to get more done on your own.<p>But I don&#x27;t think management has caught up. There&#x27;s still an assumption that these skill sets don&#x27;t go together.

635151,comment,633358,633708,0,0,neilc,,,"I think the comparison with prisons is pretty bunk. Students and their parents get to choose which school they'd like to attend; for many people, that means an enormous amount of school choice. With home schooling in many states and the GED, students have still more choice. And of course, you're free to drop out -- you just have to be willing to accept the consequences.",1243810259
635150,comment,634011,634011,0,0,glevy,,,"Leave it to the attorneys to come up with scary stuff. It seems that Google may be learning from Microsoft to push its weight around. I wonder if this would violate antitrust laws?<p>Under normal circumstances if Google were a smaller company, an inventor whose invention have been infringed by Google, would have the option of shopping around and use another product than Wave. And Google may be entirely in its own right to refuse providing him with a service.\nHowever, given the potential of Wave and the enormous size of Google, Wave could possibly completely replace email. Depriving the inventor of the Wave license would cause him irreparable harm since he cannot shop around for a comparable product.Google is facing an antitrust issue. Google is becoming like Microsoft.<p>Here is another angle:\nBackground: If several persons are co-inventors on a wave invention without having assigned it to a single entity such as a company, then each co-inventor own 100% of the invention. This means that each one can independently conduct business such as leasing or selling 100% of the invention.\nSo let's say that Google infringes on the invention and one of the inventors sues Google for 100% of damage. Google by contract can cancel the license for that one inventor but the other ones can still use the wave license. So one of the inventor needs to be willing to sacrifice himself.<p>Who would sue Google anyways???? Microsoft???",1243810198

Then after the lecture just digitalise the footnotes. Really depends on how much of the lecture is formulas/diagrams to text I suppose.",1243810117
635148,comment,635051,635051,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I don't think Google has been very clear about what Wave really is. There are several components:<p>* The Wave Protocol (<a href=""http://www.waveprotocol.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waveprotocol.org/</a>) is the heart of the system, and IMO the most interesting part. It's an extension to XMPP, and roughly analogous to SMTP if you're comparing Wave to email. Google will be open sourcing a version of their Wave Protocol server.<p>* The Google Wave client is a GWT application that uses a custom Comet-ish protocol over HTTP to communicate with the server. Analogous to Gmail's web interface or any other email client. I expect this will be open sourced as well, since the Wave Protocol server is useless without a client.<p>* The ""robot"" API is the JSON-RPC protocol that lets programs interact with Waves to do interesting things like spell checking and translation (""Spelly"" and ""Rosy"" are Google's implementations, likely remaining proprietary). This is separate from the Wave Protocol, but may become a de-facto standard. IMO this is the second most interesting part of Wave. I don't think there's anything quite like this in existing email system (custom server-side spam filters and such?)<p>* The ""gadgets"" API lets you embed untrusted code to add functionality in Waves.<p>* The ""embed"" API lets you embed a Wave on a webpage, a la the Google Maps API.<p>Looking at the API docs gives a rough overview of the last 3 (<a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/wave/guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/apis/wave/guide.html</a>) and waveprotocol.org covers the first. There's not much info about the GWT client yet.",1243810106

Yup, conferences are great for networking especially for newbies like myself who don't have existing contacts in the industry. The best way for newbies to go about it though is to find all the free or inexpensive conferences available, or offer to volunteer. At least in the Bay Area, there's no shortage of opportunities. I'm volunteering at two in exchange for attendance, and have another four lined up that are free or under $25. The BarCamp movement and related is great for tech newbies and really speak to unbannable's points above.",1243809168

You start moving them. An hour later, it looks like the contractor screwed up and sent you some of the wrong stuff; nobody bothered to check beforehand. You re-load half the truck.<p>Another hour or so goes by and the Commander decides that since the contractor screwed up one item, you're just sending it all back. You spend a few more hours re-packing the entire truck.<p>You just spent hours doing something you should have never done in the first place, but it was really important to finish it quickly, which actually, ironically, caused it to take far longer than it should have, due to constantly conflicting orders.<p>In general, there is a lot of ""move stuff here, okay never mind, move it here."" or ""do this, okay new orders from the top, do this instead"" or ""do this because it was ordered, even though everyone here knows it will be reversed next week"".<p>You can see this taken to its logical end when it comes to in-country Units replacing each other.

While Reddit wants to thrive on the fact that there are very little limitations to the platform as a whole, the problems they are facing are due in part to the fact that there are no repercussions for trolls, doxxing and the like.<p>There are a lot of reasons people want to stay anonymous that has nothing to do with cowardice, and that's why I cited the RealID case, because it sprouted a lot of conversation on why we prefer to remain unknown and separate our real selves from other personas. The [wonderful] acceptance speech Lana Wachowski gave last month during the Human Rights Campaign Awards went into why both her and her brother preferred staying out of the spotlight, but what it specifically meant to her as someone that was susceptible to unwanted attention and criticisms. As a woman, I can relate, and that's why I am so adamant about this issue.<p>> Why? If you really can't stand behind your opinion, what's the point in having it in the first place?<p>This is a really naive way of looking at opinions. They change. People grow. Why do people post anonymously to begin with? To avoid witch hunts by people that don't believe what they do, potentially dangerous people who are willing to trace that name to your workplace, your address or even just use your likeness to propagate lies. How many services are there to de-rank unsavory Google results under your name? It's truly better to be safe than sorry.",1352750249

EROEI - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_inves...</a><p>Basically, if you need to burn one barrel of oil to extract one barrel of oil from the ground, then you have already lost. Here, ""burn"" is used very loosely and is an all encompassing term including electricity for workers, rigs etc. and also the physical petrol required for transport to the refinery and end customers. The cost obviously also includes the initial investment and factors in the life of the rig installation itself as well.<p>It seems that we're currently at an EROEI of 10:1 and it's declining pretty steadily (kind of obvious). The wiki article is pretty informative. And, a cursory search on reddit for the term ""peak oil"" also returns quite a few interesting results.

I think there is a strong argument to be made that the actions and later regret of those people you refer to is a direct result of having no ""escape hatch"" in marriage. Destroying everything you have is often the only way out, even if it would have been prudent for the couple to just end the marriage and keep the relationship. But that brings us back to the parent's point: Who ends a marriage to increase the happiness of the relationship? Nobody. Divorce implies an end.",1352750183

The jumps come when a bunch of smart people can collocate and communicate. That's the recipe, and that's the only recipe. It's hard to share the energy in the room when you are not in the same room.<p>The cause of the jump though is not a bunch of people getting together, it's someone crazy enough to throw the first stone. It's someone crazy enough to question the structure science has created. It's someone daring enough to break it all apart, for the benefit of humanity, to let us rebuild and get closer to the correct path. One person starts a revolution. All the smart people look at all the pieces that broke and see how they can fit together in a new way.<p>I can't see this happening in 'new physics'. Yes, they are doing amazing things, things no one has ever been daring enough to do before. But quite frankly, they aren't diverse enough to solve their own problems they created. It's incredibly hard to solve the problems you made. There are no analogies to the problems physics is asking as of yet. To get analogies, you have to have people wander into your problem and say 'Hey! I was doing something like that for my Neuroscience research yesterday, maybe there's a connection!'. We aren't going to get that though, Physics has gone too far down the hole to relate to other fields. Unless they do what they always do, and just make new ones.",1352749924

I have a Hypermac battery and that's definitely the best buy for mobile mac use. It is really great, but they cost way too much (imho).

For a bit less power and same form factor I also still use my Zaurus C860 which works fine and runs things like Haskell fine.

4774247,comment,4772229,4773477,6,0,adunk,,,"Creator of protothreads here. Protothreads are not a hack.<p>Protothreads revolve around the concept of local continuations. Unlike traditional continuations, a local continuation only captures the state of execution within the local function in which they are created. I.e., a local continuation does not contain the call stack. This makes it possible to do things like invoking protothreads from multiple call paths.<p>The ""hack"" you refer to is just one possible implementation of the protothread concept, in which the local continuations are implemented by a switch statement in the spirit of Duff's device. This implementation technique allows the protothreads library to be implemented in only 7 lines of code (!) but it has a bunch of drawbacks, such as not recording the state of local variables. In fact, because of these drawbacks, the switch-based implementation arguably does not provide a fully functional version of protothreads.<p>There are other ways to implement protothreads. The original protothreads library contains an implementation where the local continuations are done using gotos and gcc's labels-as-values feature. This does remove some of the problems with the switch statement, but still does not record local variables. Others have implemented protothreads in C++, where a class object is used to store local variables, and by adding a C2C wrapper compiler that produces C code that stores and restores the local variables.<p>Protothreads were created to explore some of the finer points in the twilight zone between multithreading/coroutines and events/state machines. The intent was never to emulate continuations, coroutines, or threads but to find a less expensive way to achieve linear code flow. With protothreads, linear code flow can be achieved without having to store multiple thread stacks, which is important in many of the systems for which protothreads were originally intended. The switch-based implementation also has the added benefit of being possible use with any C compiler, which has been very useful as we have ported Contiki to a bunch of different platforms and C compilers.<p>But, yeah, the switch-based implementation of the protothreads concept can definitely be labelled as a hack. But - admit it -  a beautiful hack! :)",1352747389

When we see or experience something we must be able to look at it from several angles, to see other possibilities beyond the obvious ones. We imagine that the objects around us can be used and co-opted for different purposes. We do not hold on to our original idea out of sheer stubbornness, or because our ego is tied up with its rightness. Instead, we move with what presents itself to us in the moment, exploring and exploiting different branches and contingencies. We thus manage to turn feathers into flying material. The difference then is not in some initial creative power of the brain, but in how we look at the world and the fluidity with which we can reframe what we see.

Immediately put the necessary base in an interest bearing account (~5%) to earn your comfy yearly income off the interest. $200K/0.05 = $4M.<p>Then you'd really never need to work again, and you can focus on making interesting things.<p>There is plenty of life automation that you can do. Laundry, grocery delivery, maid services, restaurants, financial planner. <p>You can easily spend $1M on travel for months, building a dream house, etc.",1185634700

If you're interested, email me.<p>One problem is regulation. To get ""in the loop"" at offices, some things need to be clarified. A simple example: when an insurance company pays for a specialist to give you an x-ray, which of the three parties owns the data? Another problem is secure access to private information. Another friend was working in IT at a hospital, and they almost got sued because they didn't follow proper procedures when copying data -- between servers for regular/transparent backups!<p>It's a mess.",1185634088

8518662,comment,8515589,8515589,0,0,paulgerhardt,,,"There are a lot of different things going on here but the article is very vague and may not be reporting anything new. Or perhaps it is.<p>First off there are two generations of keyless entry systems. The older rolling code system, KeeLoq, was developed by a South African company and bought by Microchip in the &#x27;90&#x27;s- a near full break was widely published in 2004/2005 and tools released a few years later[1]. The newer system is called \nHiTag2/3/Pro. Vulnerabilities also exist in HiTag2.<p>Additionally there is a vehicle immobility device known as Megamos (which Land Rover is known to use) - a break was published last year but an injunction by the UK High Court prevented release of much of the technical details at the time.[2] If criminals are breaking Megamos than this is news. To paraphrase HN user brians: &quot;given sure confidence that there is a vulnerability, skilled security [criminals] can find it very quickly. &quot;\n[3]<p>Most talks and articles that come out focus on Keeloq. It&#x27;s trivial to capture a packet from the remote when not near the vehicle and replay that packet when near the vehicle to gain access. [4]<p>Once one has access to the vehicle there is a separate attack on the OBD-II port to start the vehicle. This was a a widely published attack on BMW&#x27;s involving this.[5]<p>Also, the equipment required to clone a modern electronic car key is widely available. I personally saw a number for sale in the security malls around Shenzhen. Banning ownership of key-recoders probably won&#x27;t work as most of this can be done with an SDR. The price for an SDR is about the same as a 3D printer (thousands last year, hundreds this year.) SDR&#x27;s are already cheaper than most dedicated programmers.[6]<p>Even though most of the protocols are vulnerable or broken it should be noted they are not ineffective. For instance there was an 88% decrease in theft between the pre-98 and post 98 Honda Civic models which began implementing (broken) anti-theft keys.[7]<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_crMuwBp8I"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_crMuwBp8I</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity13/dismantling-megamos-crypto-wirelessly-lockpicking-vehicle-immobilizer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity13/dismantli...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8456206"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8456206</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wireless-car-hack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wireless-car-hack/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.bmwland.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=135599&sid=66cdcd99d0403af2d27e6ec2d40a5daa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmwland.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=135599&s...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.avtotools.com/index.php?productID=409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.avtotools.com/index.php?productID=409</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-honda-accord-most-stolen-car-20140814-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-honda-accord-...</a>",1414450631

8518652,comment,8517344,8517344,0,0,shostack,,,"Wow, that took me back.<p>&quot;When I was twelve, I found a crystal amulet that allowed me to telepathically communicate across vast distances. A telltale glint of quartz had caught my eye as I strode the coastal cliffs of Elanthia. I scaled the rock face and discovered a glowing amulet half-buried in white sand.&quot;<p>Yep, I remember the Coastal Cliffs, farming sea nymphs to stock up on gold rings.  The amulets were nice, but the gold rings let you mark a location and teleport back to it by turning the ring. Very convenient for long-distance travel.<p>If the author was tired of all the calculations and such, it is a shame they didn&#x27;t try out the &quot;sequel&quot; to Gemstone III, Dragonrealms.  Still set in the world of Elanthia, DR&#x27;s purpose was to provide a game world of description and imagination, and instead of the raw calculations and random rolls it displayed text narratives of what was happening.  For example, a critical hit might result in severing a limb or decapitating your foe.  There were many other major leaps beyond GSIII and DR was an absolutely amazing game with a passionate community (still is as far as I know).  Simutronics also had a few other attempts at gaming experiences with a Hercules and Xena knockoff, a detective game, etc.  Never really got into those however.<p>One of the bigger issues I had with how Simutronics approached things though was their absolutely ridiculous pricing.  It made sense back in the day when they were the MUD of choice to play and cutting edge.  But the only thing that has changed since then is the prices have gone up.  Currently it is $14.95/mo for EACH SEPARATE GAME.  And extra character slots are an extra $2.50/mo/slot [1].<p>I normally am quite polite when I speak with customer service reps.  However when I called them last year to consider reactivating my account (after tiring of all the latest MMOs) and asked the price, I slipped when he told me and blurted out &quot;YOU HAVE TO BE SHITTING ME. This an ancient text-based MUD and you are charging HOW MUCH?! And it would cost even more to get access to all my extra characters again?!&quot;<p>Not the rep&#x27;s fault of course, but come on...that is an absurd price to charge for a text-based game with gaming where it is today.  Yes they had highly-involved GMs, and the community was exceptionally high-quality, but that price is just unrealistic (for me at least).<p>I&#x27;d love to get back in, and would even consider paying $5-10/mo for access to all games with a much higher character slot limit, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m paying this price.  Which is a shame, because I spent a large chunk of my youth exploring these lands (and can credit it with teaching me to touch-type at over 100WPM at my peak).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.play.net/dr/account/account_faq.asp#A1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.play.net/dr/account/account_faq.asp#A1</a>",1414450509

8518586,comment,8517187,8517980,0,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"Excellent reply. I confess to finding the US system mind boggling. The whole concept of &quot;voter registration&quot; and its being controversial and source of discrimination just boggles my mind - as does how ridings are determined.<p>We have pretty much a single voter&#x27;s list: We have a federal organization responsible for maintaining the federal list, and it shares information with its provincial counterparts, and vice versa, and they each cross-check their information for integrity purposes.<p>When you file your income tax, which is done exclusively federally, except for in Quebec, you can check a box to share your name and address info with Elections Canada for purposes of maintaining the federal list. The provincial agencies use all available provincial and municipal sources of information to cross-check their lists with data obtained from the federal agency. Door-to-door enrollment is pretty much never done, except when there are major changes in an area that have yet to be reflected in the various sources of information.<p>That same independent federal agency sets federal riding boundaries based on population; it was created about 50 years ago to prevent jerrymandering and works pretty darned well: The government does not get any say in setting riding boundaries (we have a pretty transparent auditing system, which helps).<p>In fact, in Southern Ontario, the provincial ridings are aligned with the federal boundaries, so the independent federal agency is scrutinized by the government of the most populous province, as well as by the federal auditing arm.<p>Several weeks before an election, each registered voter gets a card in the mail with their polling place and, in the case of municipal elections, at least in Ontario, their ballot colour (we have four independent school systems, don&#x27;t ask, sigh, and the ballot ensures you get the correct school board candidates).<p>You arrive at a poll with your card (optional, really, if you know what you are doing, they have all the same info) and a piece of photo ID and you are checked against the published list. If you aren&#x27;t on it, you can register at the time, but I don&#x27;t know the details, never had to do it.<p>This morning as my name was being crossed off the list by the volunteer at my table, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the names of my wife (out of the city today, voted early) and my daughter (in school downtown all day, voted early) were crossed off in the actual printout provided to the polling place, not crossed off by hand.<p>Oh, and in Ontario, at least, we pretty much use the same ballot and tabulation system for all elections. No hanging chad, no arms to pull, no electronic screens. A piece of paper, a marker, and a &quot;privacy screen&quot;: you mark your ballot, slide it into the screen, take it to the returning officer who inserts the open end from which the ballot protrudes into a scanner, which pulls in the ballot, scans it, tabulates it, and slides the ballot into a locked box, available for hand recounting afterwards.<p>Nice and simple and effective and completely non-controversial. The Bush-Gore election honest-to-god boggled our minds.",1414449653

TLDR: we have no worries here either.<p>3) Major GitHub UI updates: these do have the potential to break some functionality, but our major feature (the Boards) is pretty robust.

You can style the HTML output with css easily, and you can even get good looking math by including your LaTeX in a literal block, and use MathJAX in your HTML template to generate the math when the reader looks at it.<p>PDF however is a different story. Currently, docbook&#x27;s PDF backends use dblatex or fop. Fop is more styleable out of the box, having many parameters you can set. However, fop doesn&#x27;t support ligatures in the output, and has some issues with math typesetting. dblatex has better quality output, but the amount of configurability of the xml stylesheet is limited. In order to configure the output, you must write a LaTeX sty file, which is much more difficult than a css stylesheet.<p>A nice thing about docbook is it has xml stylesheets to transform to split page HTML and single page HTML.<p>Honestly though there&#x27;s not really many alternatives. Texinfo can produce single page HTML, split HTML, and PDF, but offers very little PDF styling.

Perceptual hashing can be surprisingly lightweight -- by the end of the experiment I was really just benchmarking image loading libraries.

More regulation and reporting requirements\n2. Hyper short term investors<p>The first incurs great costs, and counterintuitively reduces transparency. The second drives heavy gaming of the market. You can&#x27;t hold a company accountable to day to day events, you probably can&#x27;t even hold them accountable to month to month growth, it&#x27;s an unnecessary burden and short term predictability doesn&#x27;t correlate to long term value growth.<p>As a result companies wait longer before going IPO, and individual investors (read: the 99%) are no longer able to invest in the growth stage of companies. The implications of this are interesting:\n1. Rich get richer, poor can&#x27;t. Retirement funds and the likes get no real returns.\n2. Things like second market, the JOBS act and more will provide real alternatives to the public market. Extend this out 100 years, the IPO market becomes day to day gambling with 0 connection to real growth. People will write algorithms to play this game, and it will roughly be a zero sum game. Private unregulated markets will replace the public market once individuals have the freedom to invest. They&#x27;ll look like public markets of the past where there wasn&#x27;t rapid trading and there were less regulatory requirements.<p>As a company, I would much rather list on a private market where people were only allowed to buy and sell my stock once per quarter. You could design an auction system that allowed the price to be set based on how many shares were requested to be bought / sold (could be similar to the way IPO prices are originally set). I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with short term ebbs and flows of the market, and worries of cascading crashes due to day to day events and rumors. Instead I&#x27;d get to release a comprehensive quarterly report explaining how the company is doing and why people should buy into our growth, and give a gameplan for how we plan to deal with crisis. Someone should build this, and figure out a way to let individuals invest.",1414448820

I&#x27;ve never seen Microsoft beat anyone in the marketplace who didn&#x27;t deserve it.  Like Google and Apple, they were lucky to have some of the least-competent competition in the history of business.  When those competitors proved inept at defeating Microsoft in the marketplace, they went whining to the DoJ.<p>I believe that any other consumer-friendly OS, if exposed to the same critical scrutiny that Windows faced, would have fared just as badly in the quality and security areas where Windows has traditionally taken most of its bashing.  Windows didn&#x27;t win over OS/2, MacOS, and Linux because of any skulduggery on Bill Gates&#x27;s part (and yes, I agree, there was plenty of legitimate skulduggery to accuse Microsoft of perpetrating.)  It won because the others sucked even more.<p>Moreover, I believe that the network effects that arose from the dominance of Windows were far more beneficial than the sort of meaningless competition that prevailed in earlier personal computing eras, where everyone was selling proprietary hardware and OSes that were just different enough from everyone else&#x27;s to make life annoying and expensive for independent developers.  Modern mobile developers don&#x27;t know how lucky they are that they only have to target two 800-pound gorillas.<p>So I disagreed strongly with the DoJ&#x27;s antitrust efforts, and would have even without the involvement of figures like Judge Jackson whose legal talents would have been better spent adjudicating parking tickets.

And it looks like they got some important things wrong, which makes their conclusions suspect.<p>For instance they claim an ADD mem, reg instruction would be translated into three 3 uops. This is definitely not the case, x86 chips can do a load+arith_op or a store+arith_op in the same uop. The reason they need to do this is because the old x86 (in the pre-AMD64 days) had only 8 registers so spills were very common and so loads and stores were very frequently executed, much more so than in RISC code. This meant that getting maximum performance out of the memory subsystem was very critical for x86. I remember an AMD chief architect telling me that the hardest part of building a performant x86 core is getting the memory subsystem right.<p>Anyway, back to the paper, I&#x27;m not terribly impressed. The uops/instruction number looks bogus. I remember those numbers being very close 1. The cycles per uop of 0.37 seems wildly optimistic.

I mean, people think that Gates is being so clever with his pedantic word-play jargon games, but they are forgetting is that the Federal prosecutor is smarter at word games, is well versed in law, and can easily pick out minutiae. He would have just made Gates wait 6 hours and ask the question again and again and again, until finally, he writes up a report saying how uncooperative Mr. Bill Gates was during the deposition (whose entire point is that you are supposed to cooperate) and thus making the case of plea bargaining even harder. (He is quite smart. Probably top of the class at Harvard law knowing how federal prosecutors are hired.)<p>The whole idea of a deposition is you try and co-operate. If I were a judge do you see why I&#x27;d take a     very dim view of that tape? The article is cnn&#x27;s main story from that year.<p><pre><code>    But as a sign of how worried Microsoft is about the effect of the videotape, the company brought in a hired gun to talk to reporters about how depositions are typically combative and involve &quot;jousting&quot; and, in that sense, how Gates&#x27; deposition was &quot;unremarkable.&quot;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhen you have to do that, you know something is wrong. Oh and btw that is completely disregarding how it affects public opinion which in turn might harden Justice dept through pressure via political bodies (congress and white house) that are susceptible to public opinion. Remember, all depositions are public record.<p>It might seem quite funny and clever to you but an average American outside the Valley probably sees it very different - an overpaid arrogant CEO.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>As for how come there was very little outcome, apparently it&#x27;s a fairly well established claim in various law journals that the whole reason MSFT case failed was because after 9/11, they didn&#x27;t seem to want to go after an American champion. Or MSFT would&#x27;ve been broken apart. Prosecuting them changed as political priorities changed. (Date of settlement is November &#x27;01). And a Republican revival started around the same time.<p>Also note that Gates retired a few months later. Official reasoning was given as him feeling burned out, apparently.",1414447857

Photography is so much bigger, more powerful than this.<p>A good photograph is 95% subject, composition, and light, and 5% technical mastery. It&#x27;s nice to nail the last 5% sure, but there is altogether way too much noise being made about the 5% to the deafening silence about the 95%.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that if you took two identical novice photographers and gave them each $1,000, one who spends it on classes and books, and the other who spends it on gear, that the gearhead will have shown the least improvement in actual images (by a wide, wide margin) than the one who spent it gaining knowledge.

Firstly, I did not reference Citizens United, but the Supreme Court.<p>But regardless, since you bring it up, the majority opinion in Citizens United rests on the idea that corporations are protected by the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments.<p>It is simplistic and naive to treat corporations as just &quot;an association of people&quot;, or even that their political interests align with their shareholders&#x27;. The vast majority of shareholders are simply looking at their return on the dollar, with little understanding of or the time and resources to look into a corporations political financing and lobbying activities, much less have access to the behind the scenes of what is really going on. A corporation takes on a will and &quot;conscience&quot; of its own, not necessarily in sync with its shareholders or even employees.<p>The other basis of the ruling, that monetary contributions are protected as &quot;free speech&quot;, is a problem because money is not anywhere near evenly distributed, and so overwhelmingly undermines the idea of &quot;one-person, one vote&quot;. This problem would still exist without corporations having &quot;money as free speech&quot; rights, but it is even worse if corporations have it.<p>I agree with Justice Stevens that &quot;A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.&quot;",1414447815

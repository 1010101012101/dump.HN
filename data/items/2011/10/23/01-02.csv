Who doesn't like the smart productive guy? Conversely, who can stand the dumb guy on the team who never does any work? Of course there are exceptions, but my experience is that the social structure among nerds is largely a meritocracy. Just don't be mean to people.<p>If this hasn't been your experience, I think you had some misfortune by ending up in companies where politics dominate. There are both. Look at upper management - are they technically smart, or charismatic? Whichever one they are is likely what will have propagated throughout the company. Also watch out for mediocrity, that propagates too.<p>Of course, I'm referring to technical jobs, not business in general. If it were MBA, I'd agree with you.",1319334871

This means that the whole system is pointless, because consumers are <i>never</i> protected from the highest-risk money transmitters: those who never bothered to apply for a license (maybe because the requirements are so high).

Not often, but more than I'd have expected.<p><i>Overall</i> trend graphs may show one picture, but available people with required skills in a particular geographic area would show large differences in some areas (educated guess, at best, but seems to bear out via anecdotes from friends in my network).<p>The jobs that change tech requirements to expand the list of people that can use tend to be centered around smaller/shorter projects.  A company that's been largely python by default for years may grudgingly open up their job search to php or ruby people, both in hopes that those people can pick up python, but also realize that they'll probably have new systems written in a new tech stack, and that's just the way it goes.<p>It would be easier for developers to 'go' where the jobs are if the 'going' was more able to be remote, but for many reasons that's still not a reality for the majority of tech workers.",1319334282

What we do instead is try keep inflation predictable, so that interest rates on savings and debts can easily factor in inflation and neither savers nor borrowers are treated unfairly.<p>Getting back to the case in question, the link between printing money and inflation isn't magical, the mechanism that turns more money into inflation is people using that money to bid up the prices of goods and services.  But the money that was in the mattress wasn't being spent on anything.  So both taxing that money away and printing new money result in exactly the same amount of new money chasing goods and services.<p>You don't have to take my word for it.

Each of those would include a transistor as well so another 31.5M transistors, coming out to driver logic at the edge of the screen.  At 498 ppi that would be about an 8"" x 5"" screen.<p>To drive that screen at 60hz you would have to push out 31.5M * 60 bytes of pixel data (that is for 8 bits per color, higher fidelity 10 bits per color would be more. At 60hz that is a bandwidth of 1.8 GBps or 18 Gbit/sec. This is faster than the current DVI spec is rated for, although I believe dual-channel can get there.<p>The yield rate inversely increases the cost per good screen, so a yield rate of 50% doubles the cost, and a more likely yield of 25% quadruples the cost. This can be offset somewhat by bigger glass (more chances to succeed, semiconductor manufacturing is in many ways a game of statistics) but bigger glass may require different factory layouts (they might have to build a factory just for this type of display).<p>So Nvidia helped make some progress when they announced the Tegra-3 could drive 2560 x 1600 displays. That's more than halfway to your 4K display. And this will be the 'killer' display technology in the next gen 10"" tablets.<p>If the tablets can keep up the ship rate then they will give manufacturers a better feeling about being able to sell enough even higher resolution displays to offset their costs and that is when we'll see something like this demo come out in a larger size.",1319333573

This is a common flaw with statistics.<p>Example - Most successful tech entrepreneurs are male (let's say 9/10). That doesn't mean that women are only 1/10 as likely to succeed in that space if they tried, it just means that most successful tech entrepreneurs are male.<p>People with Bachelor's degrees are likely higher than averagely smart and ambigious people with successful and supporting parents.

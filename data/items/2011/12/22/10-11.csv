3381135,comment,3379962,3380224,4,0,cheald,,,"I actually agree with his stance against shadowing variables, just on philosophical grounds. It encourages good, descriptive naming. On the other hand, I acknowledge that sometimes it's desirable to shadow outer variables. I think it should be discouraged, but not prevented.<p>I think the big problem with Coffeescript's behavior is that it can introduce some <i>damn subtle</i> bugs that can be really hard to track down if you don't know what you're looking for, because you're not able to explicitly specify scope semantics. It's even worse if you're polluting higher-scope variables of the same type, because it becomes even less obvious where the error comes from.<p>Coffeescript more or less shares Ruby's scoping rules, but there's a cultural difference between the Ruby and Javascript communities that makes it a little less workable in Javascript. Specifically, Ruby's ""everything is an object"", aggressive use of namespacing, and the general idiom that only constants go into the global namespace tends to limit scope issues that could arise from mix-ins.<p>Coffeescript does attempt to mimic this by providing class semantics and wrapping everything in anonymous functions to limit scope leak, but there's still a lot of temptation to just create a bunch of top-level functions, and that leads to situations like the one described in the blog post.",1324551569

3381131,comment,3380527,3380527,3,0,moontear,,,"The ""analysis"" seems to be strongly favoring Google products in the Email/Calendar Cloud/Local Solution section.<p>- Integration with Collaboration Tools: SharePoint Online is all about collaboration. As they want to continue using Microsoft Office, there is no better way (at the moment) than SharePoint. Google's cloud connect Add-In for Office is the first try at this, but it is still rather ugly (who wants a large bar on all documents, what about using the ribbon?) They also misspelled Lync, which is the Google Talk of Microsoft, goes much further than GTalk and integrates in ALL Office applications. You can chat with the people currently editing the same document you are editing on your local computer.<p>- Ease of Tools Development: ""Google has a more robust and documented API"" - NO, simply not true. ""aligned with the skillsets on campus"" is a valid argument. But saying it is easier to develop for Google products than for the MS stack is a stretch.<p>- User Familiarity: They say, that they use MS Office. Familiarity therefore is high with Office 365.",1324551431

Or how JQuery (and these days Coffeescript) makes client-side web code clean and accessible to everyone, without the previous Javascript hacks and DOM-spaghetti.

This means the people trying to contribute with CS-JS will be adding longer code that doesn't fit with the coding style of the project, and will be much longer. It may be possible to change CS to output less verbosely, or to ignore the difference. I think the library's main writers will ask for contributions to be in JS, so it can be written to their coding style.",1324548528

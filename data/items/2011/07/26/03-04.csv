2805925,comment,2804148,2804148,3,0,brudgers,,,"While in the short term, Android and iOS are having an impact, RIM's longterm fate is affected by Windows Phone 7  because that is the easiest Mobile OS upon which Enterprise can standardize comfortably - iOS is just too consumer centric [e.g. three year obsolescence] and has a history of sloppy security practices [e.g. lying to Exchange], and Android is somewhat fragmented due to diversity of device capabilities  and does not give a high priority to integration with the Microsoft stack.<p>All the things RIM does well for enterprise, Windows Phone is likely to do better over the long term. And with Nokia getting set to leverage their existing reputation for quality on top of WP7, it is hard to see what RIM can bring to the table when it comes time to convince IT.\n[<a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/501815/iPhone_3.1_Breaking_Exchange_E_Mail_for_Enterprise_iPhone_3G_Users_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cio.com/article/501815/iPhone_3.1_Breaking_Exchan...</a>]",1311652734

2805919,comment,2805708,2805874,16,0,rpearl,,,"There's a few aspects to discuss here.<p>Firstly, in 2006 (5 years ago), x64 chips were Core2Duos clocked at about 2.2Ghz. This is top of the line, but even a mid-level processor would be something like 1.6Ghz. A PC would probably have about 2GB of RAM.<p>An iPad2 is a 1GHz, dual core device. Further, it is built for a mobile device, and thus will sacrifice performance for the sake of battery life, at the very least in subtle ways. It has 512MB of RAM. That's not quite equivalent, not yet. Certainly the next round of mobile hardware will be above and beyond the level of said desktops by a good margin.<p>Second, there is the performance profile characteristics I mentioned before. I don't know much of the details of ARM, but for example: you can only load a 12-bit immediate. Larger constants must be loaded into a constant pool. The iPad's L1 cache is significantly smaller than that of a desktop processor. Both have 16 general purpose registers, but spilling to the stack will take more of a hit on ARM.<p>Then there is code quality. Current codegen for ARM is not as good as x64--checking the tag and performing a conditional jump in Jaegermonkey currently produces 3 instructions where it could be done in 1 instruction. When an constant is loaded into the constant pool there is no check to see whether it was necessary to load it (was it already loaded in?) There was a lot of focus on code generation quality in x86-land which has only recently been shifting to ARM--I expect those pieces of the puzzle to be solved very quickly.<p>To address your other point, what information is indicative of Mozilla being ""stretched too thin""?<p>(For my credentials when talking about Firefox's Javacsript JIT--I am an intern currently working on the next generation JS JIT, Ionmonkey. Code is here: <a href=""http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ionmonkey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ionmonkey/</a>)",1311652433

It would likely function amazingly well, too.<p>However, for this to work, you have to eliminate the space for ads.  To deal with this, Rutledge suggests ""Quality news is subscription only. You pay for valuable information. Fluff you get for free.""<p>I somehow don't think it's that simple.<p>If you slam the digital door shut (much more than it is now at the Times), and only allow subscriber access, you'll do two things:<p>(1) vastly reduce your readership; if you want to go back to showing ads, you can't, because you no longer can brag about the vast numbers reading your website daily\n(2) create a hyper-focused pirating scheme around disseminating NYTimes content for free<p>I love news. I love good reporting. When I'm no longer a student, I'll pay to get the Times at home.

Wikipedia says that in California first-offense drunk driving is a misdemeanor crime, and one of the penalties can be a four-month driver license suspension. Since public transportation is inadequate in much of the country, many states offer an ""occupational license"" during a suspension that allows a person to drive to/from work. Likewise due to inadequate alternate transportation options, many drivers with suspended licenses violate the law and drive anyway; the penalties for this are often not very high.<p>PS: Guardrail is the correct word.",1311652202

I've rarely had to work over-time (mainly writing web applications and servers) and when I did it was usually of my own volition. The problem with doing is that you burn out a lot faster than you think. Being frustrated and unhappy can interfere with doing your job as a programmer. We're paid to think and good thinking can only happen when you have a clear, healthy state of mind.<p>If I've ever done ""crunch time"" against my will it's usually because some manager or sales person went above my head and made promises without clearing it with me. That's very unprofessional IMO. It's also unprofessional to avoid taking the initiative to righting that sort of wrong. It's like watching someone walk backwards into traffic and not doing anything to stop them. If you're part of the team, you're going to be hurting yourself too.

I wanted to make a similar site a while ago, but the following stopped me:  1) why would I put my FAQ page on someone else's site?  2) if I did it via JavaScript, then it wouldn't be easily indexable - less true now that google indexes JavaScript.<p>Anyway, I wish you both the best!",1311649458

They're fed up and have determined whoever they get their hands on (minor hacking or not) they're going to drag you into federal court and make an example out of them.<p>This reminds of back in the 90's when there wasn't any laws in place to address hacking. But man, the Feds did not like kids making them look like fools. Once they got the laws of the books, it was open season on hackers.<p>I'm pretty sure the next few years are going to see a major crackdown on hacking again. Just like the recent arrests of supposed Lulsec and Anon members.<p>This guy will be lucky to get out of federal prison in 15 years.",1311649427

With search built into the iPhone and the future value of mobile search in mind, I think it would be near foolish for Apple to miss this opportunity. Otherwise, no matter how well the iPhone does, Google will still always have its hand in mobile advertising money.<p>But what do I know?<p>I think it would place Apple and Google in a very interesting competitive position.",1311649364

Last time I checked the iPad browser (probably the best tablet browser) was something like 15x slower than Chrome desktop in javascript benchmarks.<p>This is the #1 blocker to mobile web app adoption. Try viewing a SVG on a mobile browser and see what happens. You're flipping a coin.  Why doesn't Mozilla focus on bringing mobile/desktop feature parity before adding device level APIs?",1311649280

I didn't say there's conclusive evidence of a link - just that a cautious individual who wants to maximise their lifespan will probably assume that it's best to sleep 6-8 hours a night.<p>Edit: Of course, that's assuming the study results are actually correct, which according to ajkirwin's comments, they're possibly not.",1273053313

I tried the same that you wou would have tried jacquesm, by searching on the other songs in the video.  Thinking the opening of the video was the same song, and was also the cleanest part of the video, Midomi should pick it up with ease.  I was wrong -- it couldn't find it or the results were too broad to narrow it down to a specific track.<p>So, I tried the actual track and surprisingly it found it.",1273053148

What's the point of mooching if you're not going to use that time productively? Eventually he'll have to find a new job, and not very many places want candidates with 5 years experience in pretending to work.<p>I can understand a few weeks of slacking, but any longer than that and I would go stir-crazy. Instead of playing games or browsing the web, he could have used his idle time to find an interesting job or hobby. He could have read books or learned a new language (computer or human). He had an opportunity to make money while improving himself, and he squandered it.<p>Edit: I think it's likely the story is exaggerated, but I've been in a similar situation. I used my free time to interview for other jobs and study/practice/learn. It's so easy to fall into the trap of wasting time in exactly the same way every day.",1273052946

It deals with tech, and it's a critique of trends in user-interface design (specifically in games), even if it dos so in a rather 'fun' format.  And not just any part of the interface, but the all-critical ""first impression"".

1320733,comment,1320722,1320730,0,0,swombat,,,"Agreed in principle, but in practice I think the argument goes as follows:<p>1) There is evidence that prolonged lack of sleep (6h/night or less) leads to an early death<p>2) Many polyphasic sleep methods involve dramatically less sleep than 6h a night<p>3) There is no implied correlation between those two statements, but a cautious person who wants to maximise their chance of living as long as possible would infer that:<p>- Given the lack of data, it is probably a better idea to avoid polyphasic sleep altogether until proper studies are conducted.<p>Previously, the argument was that there is no evidence linking lack of sleep with death, therefore why not give polyphasic sleep a go. I think that argument is not valid anymore.",1273052666

For a start, it's a meta-analysis pulling from a simply massive pool. And it asks people about areas of their life from a few years upto two and a half decades.<p>Do YOU know how often you slept under six hours a night in the last year? 2 years? 5? 10?<p>Did all these people keep detailed sleep diaries every single night?<p>This just raises too many questions. Meta-analysis is most useful when restricted to much smaller sample sizes where a greater amount of data can be obtained and analyzed.<p>--\nEdit for More Info:<p>It seems that this paper is a meta-study of OTHER papers. And that 80% of the data used came from a single study by Daniel F. Kripke of UCSD.<p>The conclusions of Kripke study, which were meta-analysed, were notably different than Cappuccio's, namely:<p>""The best survival rates were found among those who slept 7 hours per night. The study showed that a group sleeping 8 hours were 12 percent more likely to die within the six-year period than those sleeping 7 hours, other factors being equal. Even those with as little as 5 hours sleep lived longer than participants with 8 hours or more per night.""",1273052185

The product isn't marketed for noncommercial use, and part of the way the entire site is built makes you think ""oh man, this is going to cost me down the line,"" even if it's free now.<p>Plus even look at how buried the product is. Its been subjugated to secondary brand status, plus clip art. All you need are a set of white papers and it is full-on enterprise sell mode.<p>If you make social software you have to sell the software and market the software in a friendly, social way.

Are you getting 30% more salary than you got last year?<p>I was lucky enough to go long on various commodities when a lot of this started.  Didn't have much to spare but dumped everything I could in a metals basket.  Cashed out, paid off various things, started a business, got back in the market, and as of now it's far more than half again the value I put in.<p>So this story is about how things are supposedly turning around, and if we look at the change from last month, hey, maybe they are.  But as others in the thread have pointed out far more eloquently, the piper has yet to be paid.  This whole situation is and has been a cascading systems failure and the Federal Reserve and the US government are forced to become beholden to more and more entities - first the airlines, banks, mortgage brokers, auto manufacturers, on and on, and always Wall Street holding a gun to Bernanke's head because they know he'll cave - after all he did the first time! and the second! and so on; with the citizens and shareholders (anyone with a salary, fixed welfare/pension, or savings) bearing the brunt and with no say.<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/markets/indicators/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/markets/indicators/</a> - ""Economic and financial indicators, Feb 11th 2010"": Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, said that he expected to consider raising the discount rate “before too long”, but that the Fed’s benchmark interest rate was likely to remain unchanged.",1266396575

I'd agree that generally the problems we all solve are not particularly time critical, when you're working on something over a week or month, there's not going to be anything which needs doing in ten minutes. On the other hand, when you're supporting live systems, there can be times when being able to diagnose and fix a problem in a few minutes, under pressure, can be a valuable skill. It's at times like that that you need people who can solve problems quickly in stressful situations. I'm not particularly saying that these types of questions will help you find those people, but if it's something you want to test for then they may be useful.",1266394981

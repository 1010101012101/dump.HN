How is top-level code not source code?<p>I can write BASIC code all day long without having access to the engine, the interpreter. But if I publish my result, there will be problems.<p>Also, if the language under discussion were so open, people would write third-party imitations -- not imitations of the results, but of the methods as well. But they can&#x27;t. They can&#x27;t because the source is secret.<p>> And that&#x27;s not even considering physics, biochemistry, engineering, and astronomy, ...<p>The only way a result from a proprietary source would not be an issue is if the result isn&#x27;t original. A routine statistical result, one that anyone can duplicate, isn&#x27;t likely to be an issue. But an original result, one in which the mathematics itself is key to the result, would require full disclosure.<p>> ... where many of the tools you use will always be expensive and built by industry, and have no impact on peer review.<p>Not really.

App.net is not advising that you make an alert appear on your fans&#x27; phones everytime your band publishes anything on social media; they only want the band to use this feature when a new song is being released or they are about to perform in your area. It is publisher centric; Facebook Close Friends feature(which I love and use!) is consumer-focused. I don&#x27;t think my Close Friends even know I get an alert each time they post something. In  contrast I bet app.net plans to expose detailed analytics including engagement and unsubscription rates so publishers can further optimize content and reduce noise.<p>In that way, it sounds like a Facebook Page + Close Friends feature + letting publisher trigger notification on selective posts only.",1385085091

6778714,comment,6778398,6778398,1,0,mpdehaan2,,,"disclaimer: Ansible creator here and I am a co-founder of  AnsibleWorks.<p>FWIW, Infoworld didn&#x27;t allow my comment on the article to be approved.  I appreciate the review, but also think reducing these things down to scores is probably not the best approach, and the review was skimmed over in several places, most noticeably the end piece where it would list an advantage of one tool that was in two or three.  Also, mixing in the commercial components is really more about comparing <i>companies</i>, which makes it confusing.<p>Here&#x27;s what I posted:<p>Ultimately I think configuration systems are a bit like your favorite type of food -- and folks need to try everything to find their favorite (with a node to OpsCode) cuisine. I think that&#x27;s more important than saying someone should try one or the other -- get what&#x27;s going to make you productive.<p>To us, Puppet is a large improvement over CFEngine as a configuration management tool, and Chef contains some stylistic variations on Puppet that may make it better for many audiences (especially Ruby developers). Choose what fits your thought patterns. SaltStack is a Python implementation of the Puppet with a bit of a &quot;different&quot; security architecture -- to each his own.<p>Picking something that is secure and reliable, and that you get along with the language -- to us -- is maximally important.<p>Ansible&#x27;s goal is a little bit different from the others -- be a general purpose workflow system, focused on apps. OS, apps, zero downtime rolling updates, should be maximally readable, infrastructure management should be a minimum of hassle, and it should be maximally secure. It can configure, but the reason you want to configure an OS is to roll out apps. And it can scale to many thousand nodes from a single box. (Alas, too much FUD about the SSH thing -- people should try accelerated mode too!). Most importantly, we believe the infrastructure that manages your infrastructure should not be something you have to manage.<p>So, that&#x27;s what I tried to post.  Anyway, I encourage everybody to experiment.  I tend to think we appeal more to developers than sysadmins -- because we focus on apps, so some of the generalizations in the article I find weird, but it&#x27;s also interesting to see people&#x27;s takes on things.<p>It&#x27;s always good to have attention from folks so people can find out about things -- but I think Hacker News folks should dig down beyond the generalizations, find an hour to play with everything (each), and try them in your own environment.<p>Likely one tool is going to resonate more -- and, I think most of us in different companies would agree -- we&#x27;re fine if you think that tool is not ours, but we want it to be for the right reasons -- meaning you personally tried it :)<p>People coming in from a new users perspective may also be interested in Matt Jaynes&#x27;s book here:<p><a href=\"http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-a...</a>",1385083890

However, do to natural variance in the process they don&#x27;t all perform the same. So chip makers &#x27;bin&#x27; the chips for different speeds and very different prices, essentially based on scarcity. But then with each lot and stepping the FAB starts to get better and better at making the top bin chips, and variance reduces. That&#x27;s where the marketers take over, down-binning perfectly good fast chips to serve low-end customer segments, under-clocking, fusing off perfectly functional areas or features of the the chips to protect their segmentation strategy etc. Intel, AMD, Nvidia do this all the time. That&#x27;s how they get dozens of SKUs out of only a couple of chip designs in production at one time.<p>That&#x27;s why, at many points in history, you&#x27;ll find bargain priced intel chips, that if you unlock them, turn out to work exactly as well as &#x27;extreme&#x27; or luxury-priced chips, that had just been artificially down-binned and handicapped to meet demand for lower priced PCs, and to be able to sell a chip at every price point for maximum price discrimination.<p>TL/DR - Yes, all chip makers basically price their products like airplane seats.",1385082984

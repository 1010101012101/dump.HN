It&#x27;s just a somewhat anachronistic bundling of microphone/speaker/digital radio/battery (and the tiny bit of logic needed for that to work together).<p>It does make sense to carry the things that comprise a &quot;smart phone&quot; (as above, +powerful cpu that can scale down to conserve power, gpu, screen/hud/display, camera(s), low-power local-area digital radio (eg: bluetooth), touchscreen (or drawing surface/digitizer), text-input (keyboard), gps, interface for connecting 4k+ display, possibly direct-attached storage), along with a headset, preferably wireless.<p>I just don&#x27;t see why this should all be forced into one unit. I&#x27;m not sure how much power miracast would require -- but could it really be <i>more</i> than what the led-lit touch-screen uses? Because surely it&#x27;d be easier to have big battery+wlan/miracast/bluetooth/cpu stuffed in your pocket, and a small display+touch+bluetooth device on your wrist, with the option to pull out a phablet-sized hi-res touch-screen with it&#x27;s own battery, but only miracast+bluetooth (maybe a gpu)?<p>The &quot;smart stick&quot; (the smarphone less the camera/screen/mic) could probably be made to fit more nicely in a pocket if there was no need for a display.<p>Shape it like a rod, add a powerful vibrator and the thing would even be dual-use ;-) (seriously, though - if it&#x27;s intended to be kept in a pocket, a vibrator might make sense, as well as a couple of status leds).<p>The screen is going to be a bit clunky anyway (unless it folds/rolls up) - so no real issue to add a dedicated battery for it.<p>Maybe I should file a patent for &quot;smart rod&quot;.",1435045965

The work is a nightmare now. I am not sure how to handle the situation and I need some advice.<p>Pro tip: These are my biased opinions, but I try to give some concrete examples to give you some idea.<p>One of the senior guys is the “tech lead“. He doesn’t know basics of online services and he acts like he knows what he is doing, which is not the case (he picked SOAP over REST because he likes it, he likes to define things static). He gets offended pretty easily if you question his approach. He has this inspirational driven development skills though. Every day he comes up with a new design. Even he changed the design of the system during the design review we had with stakeholders.<p>The other senior guy is technically strong, but his social skills are out of whack. His mood oscillates often. In case of a bad mood, he treats you like an idiot. I remember him entering my office, taking a chair, sitting and looking at me as if he is going to interrogate. He never accepts failure. If something is wrong, it is definitely someone else.<p>Team leader doesn’t have much idea about what we are doing. He is more of a manager than a developer. He randomizes developers with the ideas he heard from others. Anytime there is an open question, he talks about his previous project. However, he doesn’t seem to have full details.<p>Project/system is not performing well or scaling either (each request payload and response is read/written twice for instance). I have been raising questions about certain decisions (which made the tech lead guy hate me by the way), but team leader doesn’t have enough context and knowledge to deduce the actual problems.<p>I tried finding another job outside the company (I cannot just leave due to visa requirements), I failed. I am looking for an internal transfer now. However, the frustration and stress is killing me.",1435045858

&quot;In scenario 5.3.2, with a larger depletion rate, the decline of the Commoners occurs faster, while the Elites are still thriving, but eventually the Commoners collapse completely, followed by the Elites. It is important
to note that in both of these scenarios, the Elites – due to their wealth – do not suffer the detrimental effects of the environmental collapse untilmuch later than the Commoners. This buffer of wealth allows
Elites to continue “business as usual” despite the impending catastrophe.
It is likely that this is an important mechanism that would help explain howhistorical collapseswere allowed to occur by eliteswho appear to be oblivious to the catastrophic trajectory (most clearly apparent in the Roman and Mayan cases). This buffer effect is further reinforced by the long, apparently sustainable trajectory prior to the beginning of the collapse. While somemembers of societymight raise the alarm that the system is moving towards an impending collapse and therefore advocate structural changes to society in order to avoid it,
Elites and their supporters, who opposed making these changes, could point to the long sustainable trajectory “so far” in support of doing nothing.",1435045388

Sun&#x27;s libraries are a bit of a special case in that Sun really tried to rewrite everything for strategic/political reasons, but look at Android; the heavy lifting in the Android stack is done by Skia, OpenGL, and Blink/WebKit (to name a few), a strategy which works because JNI is relatively fast. Python also heavily favors using C libraries where appropriate, again because Python C bindings are fast.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the issue about cross-compilation. You don&#x27;t need a cross-compiler to statically link against native libraries; you just need a binary library to link to and a cross-<i>linker</i> (which can be language-independent). And, of course, if you dynamically link, you don&#x27;t even need that much.<p>I&#x27;m not really trying to ding Golang, in any case. M:N scheduling has benefits as well as drawbacks. FFI is one of the downsides. There are upsides, such as fast thread spawning. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.",1435044101

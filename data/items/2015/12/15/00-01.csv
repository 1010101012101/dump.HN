The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle&#x27;s destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.</i>",1450141114

10735236,comment,10734765,10734955,0,0,lsc,,,"when you change your name, you lose a lot of brand recognition, search engine or no.  If ford decided to call themselves &quot;Johnson&quot; next week, next time you wanted to buy a truck, you&#x27;d have no idea who these Johnson people were, right?  (I mean, barring some huge advertising campaign, or you being the sort of person who follows Ford in the news.)<p>Yes, there are automated ways around that, if everyone depends on the same search engine for brand recognition, but... I guess I fail to see why the search engine would really care that much.   Yes, yes, I know that as a brand owner you spend years trying to game a search engine for your brand, and that has huge value for you, the brand owner.<p>However, supporting that activity doesn&#x27;t make the search engine better for the users or for the advertisers, the two groups that a search engine cares about.  a search engine has some interest in a user getting a result that isn&#x27;t too far off from what they want, you know, so said user doesn&#x27;t leave for another search engine.  They have a conflicting (and much stronger) interest in the user getting a paid ad that is similar enough to what they want (and possibly better enough than the organic results) that they might click on it and not be unhappy, because that&#x27;s how search engines make money.   (there&#x27;s a conflict because the user wants the best result possible, while the search engine wants the organic results to be bad enough that the paid results are relevant enough to warrant a click.   Of course, but not so bad that the user goes to a different search engine.)<p>A search engine has no interest in helping businesses preserve their &quot;organic&quot; search rating.   Either enough other people talk enough about the business that the search engine thinks that the link is worth something, or they don&#x27;t.   If you have a good reputation, and then you change your name and nobody knows who you are, well, that sounds like a pretty bad idea, doesn&#x27;t it?   and while yes, it is a problem that the search engine <i>could</i> solve, there&#x27;s no reason for them, really, to do so.",1450141054

The idea that there is a cohort of mustache-twirling doctors and pill pushers trying to shove pills down the throat of every person who&#x27;d be better suited to talk therapy is about as ridiculous as I made it sound.<p>For many people, talk therapy is simply not effective or possible. And in many situations there are social forces which MUST be taken into consideration because they can cause lead to more anxiety and depression.<p>> perhaps the bigger mistake was not going off SSRIs (at which point the die may have been more or less cast for you, in the short- to medium-term) -- but agreeing to go on them in the first place.<p>I get so angry reading this. Hot under the collar even. If you think that SSRIs don&#x27;t help people then you simply don&#x27;t understand what a true and chemical despair feels like. The difference they can make, both short term and long, is counted in human lives. Many people like me who used them to bridge a short term gap could barely comprehend days without despair, fear and pain.<p>To have some smug anti-medicine comment oh-so-politely walk up to someone who says, &quot;Hey I treated my mental illness like a real illness and it worked&quot; and respond with scorn an derision? You simply do not understand what real, clinical, and life-threatening depression is.<p>If you think you do, if you had a mild case that you talked through? Congratulations!

As long as I donate to a 501(c)(3) entity, I can choose any entity I want - even one I control. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is an example of an extremely wealthy couple &quot;donating&quot; to an entity they effectively control. (I assume they do, since it bears their name. I haven&#x27;t looked up their management structure.) This entity must use their donations in accordance with the entity&#x27;s stated mission statement, or they risk losing their non-profit status. Beyond this, the donated money is still mostly controlled (within the bounds of the non-profit&#x27;s stated mission) by the wealthy couple that donated. Aside from using the funds for &quot;pet&quot; projects with dubious public value, this opens up another potential caveat, non-profit bribery.<p>It is possible for donations or non-profit entity direction to be applied as a tax-free bribe.

The I-V curve for LEDs (which is looks like a cliff and has a flat region we simplify as the &quot;forward voltage drop&quot;) varies from component-to-component and also with the temperature. Attaching them directly in parallel means that an uneven amount of current will flow through each LED. Not only that, but the LED with the most current will heat up, and its forward voltage will decrease, causing even more current to flow through it. Depending on what equilibrium is reached, this could result in that LED burning out (and the effect continuing on other LEDs), although the more typical result is just one LED that is much brighter than the others (since ultimately some steady-state will be achieved).<p>With multiple resistors, the ID curve for each resistor-LED pair doesn&#x27;t have a flat region, but instead a sloped region, and the resulting currents will be more or less equal.",1450138905

Why not just send the whole thing to the Circuit Courts whether or not there are patent issues?<p>> At trial court it makes sense to join issues that would normally be heard in separate courts together when they involve the same underlying facts, because there will be a lot of overlap in witnesses and evidence, and a trial court is both a trier of fact and a trier of law. Holding separate trials in different courts would be wasteful, annoying, and could get complicated and troubling if different courts found different facts.<p>You really get all the same issues with splitting questions of law, since the ultimate legal decision on a patent question may depend on legal decisions on evidentiary and other questions also raised on appeal, on which ultimate non-patent counts in the same case may also rely. A clean separation is not realistic.<p>> The appeals court does not determine facts.<p>Yes, it does, though the standard of review for fact questions is usually one of &quot;clear error&quot;.",1450138562

ECB is half of the time the first crypto mode a novice implements (IV? What&#x27;s an IV?) and using it over the wire is an instant replay attack vulnerability.<p>2. There is no sane default to AEAD of any sort, and modes like GCM do not even appear to be supported, per this talk. CBC is malleable [1]. Both BEAST and POODLE attacks were on TLS CBC.<p>3. DES?

The first thing I looked at, syntax study, was already weaker than prior work I&#x27;ve seen on the subject. The language choice was highly biased while not focusing on enough metrics for comparison of strengths and weaknesses. Between field use and its first &quot;evidence,&quot; your Quorum is already weaker than most of what I presented in terms of empirical weight. Due to the trolling, I&#x27;m hesistant to even watch the video in case his presentation is something likes yours in terms of content.<p>@ non-trolling, HN readers also concerned about science in software<p>Back to science, though, given other readers might be interested in that point. Software development is a combination of human- and machine-driven processes to turn some requirements into working, maintainable code. A subset of this, significant it turns out, can be analyzed for effectiveness with enough different case studies, sample sizes, objective measures, and repeats to make a claim about it with believable evidence. For process stuff, it&#x27;s not going to be as logically formulated or minutely analyzed as a math equation or something. Not usually, anyway. Instead, it works more like this:<p>1. A recurring problem exists in the development process or artifact.<p>2. Measurements are taken of how often that problem occurs in general and for specific scenarios.<p>3. A hypothesis is formed as to why it exists and a solution to it.<p>4. The hypothesis is tested by applying the technique to several projects likely to experience the problem with objective records on outcomes and subjective accounts from users for a take on less tangible aspects.<p>5. Significant reductions in the problem in the objective data provide supporting evidence that the theory is correct.<p>6. The theory (solution) is tested by others against the problem to find more supporting evidence or counter-examples to the claim.<p>7. If it&#x27;s correct, the results continue to speak for themselves in it being a solution with likely modifications as the problem and solution space are further explored.<p>Note: If it&#x27;s performed by humans, it&#x27;s wise to either look out for or control for issues like Hawthorne effect. Must be sure that it&#x27;s the overall solution that&#x27;s working rather than people&#x27;s heightened attention to an issue being studied.<p>The above 1-7 have applied to my list of techniques to varying degrees ranging from strong analysis + repeated, field results (eg formal specs, code reviews) to clear theory, models, assessment, and massive field results (eg type-systems, usage-driven testing). The evidence is quite clear and favors them as effective with repeated successes that matched the theory. Many other aspects of programming I left off the list because the evidence or studies <i>were not</i> clear. Or were non-existent. Hence me not including the parent&#x27;s strawmen (&quot;most science&quot;) or red herring (Quorum) on a list of techniques with decades of measured results behind them across many software projects.<p>Science, what little exists in our field, is on my side if the reader is focused on evidence aspects such as the Why, How, and Got Job Done. They collectively make up The Right Thing in robust, system development. YMMV for individual techniques or tools on a given project. Pick best tools for the job, prioritize your development budget, and so on. Common sense. People looking at where to start dealing with recurring issues or overall robustness have an evidence-backed list in my main comment, though. There are also papers and books on each showing where to apply them and most effectively.",1450138311

I don&#x27;t even recommend them to other people, despite the fact that they worked incredibly well for me.<p>> With all due respect to your situation -- and not intended in the least to belittle either your suffering, or the thought you put into the decisions you made -- perhaps the bigger mistake was not going off SSRIs (at which point the die may have been more or less cast for you, in the short- to medium-term) -- but agreeing to go on them in the first place.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a mistake. The mental illnesses I suffered started early in childhood, and nearly all my relatives on one side of my family experience some form of it. I resisted medication for a while because I was brought up by parents who considered psych meds to be against the natural order of things, and prohibited me from so much as asking my doctor about them.<p>In college, the panic attacks had become so severe I was beginning to lose touch with reality. My psychiatrist convinced me to give SSRIs a shot, so I reluctantly agreed, and they turned my life around. Within 6 months, friends and family (both those who knew I was taking a med and those who didn&#x27;t) remarked that I seemed to be a completely different (and better) person.<p>Obviously, they don&#x27;t work this well for most people. But likely the psychiatrist, in the absence of a mature scientific understanding of these disorders, had learned to recognize patterns that predicted a successful response to SSRIs.<p>My only point was that the discontinuation of an antidepressant should not be taken lightly when you have already had a successful response to it.",1450137968

I find Tim’s writing refreshing. He does not fluff or sugar coat his “step by steps” and this leads to (another discussion perhaps) arguments over the simplistic validity of his systems.<p>Edit: Note ""weight cutting"" for professional sports probably relates to his large gains.

Nobody is surprised that a man has sex with his wife, and nobody is surprised that the Arab states are adversaries of Iran.<p>If secrecy becomes impossible, as Assange desires, will Arab states stop calling for the U.S. to be aggressive with Iran?

For example, there’s Section 295 (a), which makes it a non-bailable offence to “outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.” There’s Section 153 (a), which seeks to punish “any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities”. There’s Section 124 (a), which prescribes life imprisonment for anyone who “by words or expression of any kind brings or attempts to bring or provoke a feeling of hatred, contempt or disaffection towards government”—something that any critic of any government could be accused of.<p>The constitution, framed not by the British but by the freedom fighters who got us independence, cops out when it comes to free speech. While Article 19 (1) (a) pays lip service to it, Article 19 (2) lays out “reasonable restrictions” such as when it applies to matters such as “public order” and “decency or morality”, matters which are, of course, open to interpretation.

But I disagree with leaks of State Dept and tactical military intelligence. Others think things are great but don't mind the leaks. Still others are apathetic and encourage the leaks. Out of a dozen people, you'll find a dozen different opinions.<p>We all -- each citizen -- have a unique relationship with our government. Who are you or anybody else to make a decision like that that effects billions of dollars spent and tens of thousands of lives? I didn't elect Assange. He doesn't represent me. And I have no recourse to remove him from his post if I feel he is acting maliciously or incompetently.<p>You see, it's not enough to make the argument that things suck so much that <i>anything</i> would be better. It doesn't work that way. That's just waving your arms around in anger and exasperation. I also believe we need to get rid of 99.99% of the secrecy we have. But there is still a role for government and secrecy. Some random person doesn't have the right to ""fix"" what he thinks is broken -- because if he can do that, then we all can. And at that point we might as well just go out in the streets with guns to get our way.<p>This is insanity. Well thought-out, for a good cause, well-intentioned, but fundamentally broken. This is like the dozenth time groups of people have been down this road. It doesn't end well -- even if the state is ""fixed"".<p>It's critically important to separate your opinion of the state of things from the reasons and rules that each individual can take to make a difference.<p>Take the Declaration of Independence. In it, Jefferson doesn't make the case that monarchical rule is broken and therefore we must act militarily -- far from it. He respects the previous state of things but then makes a detailed argument as to how the king broke the social contract with the colonies, thereby releasing governance of the states back to the ""natural legislature"" of the people. It's a very long list of things we did to try to make things work and how they didn't work out. If you want a revolution, that's the place to go to start understanding what arguments work and what arguments don't work. Move from there to ""Letters from a Birmingham Jail"".

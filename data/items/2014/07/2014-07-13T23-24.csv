It is not separation of, but <i>cross cutting</i> concerns what is highlighted, i18n, logging, error handling, target platform, etc., all with potential variations. While these commonalities are usually dealt with by throwing them to a library, the interactions of the alternative layers (there will be since they are going to be heavily coupled by the very definition of &quot;cross cutting&quot;) is better dealt with, or could potentially hurt less using some version of AOP ideas (EDIT deleted FODA reference).",1405295914

Libraries are the result of a community pooling resources (often gathered through taxes) for the funding and purchasing of materials that are then made available to all members of that community.<p>... Just as a community invests in infrastructure like roads, bridges and water management systems – a community invests in a library. Libraries, if you will, represent educational and intellectual infrastructure. A recognition that just as a road makes it easier to reach your destination, so too does access to information enable one to complete a journey of another sort.<p>... what occurs in a library is the development and maintenance through the economy of a genuine structure for sharing. Numerous people contribute a little and from this are able to get a lot, but the value they extract from their investment is not in the form of a sack of money with a dollar sign on it, but a larger social value. It is a value that would be diminished by turning it simply into a profit-generating scheme.<p>---",1405295762

WiFi is power hungry, but the iPhone 5 has ~1,500 mAh of power, and WiFi takes a continuous ~50 mAh. That gives you around 30 hours of constant wifi usage on an iPhone. Now that&#x27;s not counting everything else happening on the iPhone, which is quite a lot, but this is back of the envelope math and I&#x27;m hoping I can reveal the order of magnitude involved.<p>On the Lockitron, it depends how long it takes to wake up and ping while maintaining a low latency. In this case it&#x27;s probably something along the lines of: wake up for 25ms every 1s and check if somebody&#x27;s unlocking. This saves you 95% of power usage (950ms/1s aren&#x27;t spent powering wifi) with a max of 1s latency. But I&#x27;m not sure if 25ms is enough to ask for new messages over wifi. This still gives you 2.5 mA averaged, which will drain that iPhone battery in 600 hours, which is only 25 days.<p>And I bet this sports a smaller battery than 1,500 mAh.",1405295658

That is true if the WiFi module is <i>turned off</i>; useful if you are waking up, taking a reading, pushing data to the cloud, and then going back to sleep. But for a door you need to be listening on the network for an incoming packet all the time. How else would you know that the user wants you to open the door right now?<p>Alkaline AA batteries <i>AT BEST</i> have ~2600mAh of capacity. They run at 1.5V. You have 2600 x 1.5v = 3900 mWh of energy in each.<p>A Wifi module consuming ~3mA and 3.3V runs through that power at around 3900 / (3.3 * 3) = ~394 hours or about 16 days. 4 AA batteries and you&#x27;ll get about 64 days or little over 2 months of usage.<p>Of course you&#x27;ll get FAR LESS because:<p>A) You have to convert battery voltage to 3.3V and you&#x27;ll get about 85% efficiency for a high current (300mA peak) needed for a WiFi device<p>B) You burn more energy when you actually send packets<p>C) You need quite a bit of power from those 4 AAs to actually  turn the lock so you can&#x27;t do the math assuming all your power is available for WiFi.",1405295541

For wood burning to be carbon neutral, you have to replace the wood and produce exactly zero CO2 during harvesting and transportation. Even if we gave your picking up twigs example a good 50yrs to cycle, you&#x27;re removing fertilizer that would otherwise help the growth of current/new trees. There&#x27;s a reason we put restrictions on wood burning and overall traffic in a lot of forest areas; it reduces the forestation.<p>> This is relative to coal or oil or natural gas that have been carbon stored underground for millions of years.<p>The length of the cycle doesn&#x27;t make a difference because we&#x27;re growing energy production exponentially and seeing consistent global deforestation (thus the scaling problem). That carbon from your stove might get replaced in 10-50 years.... if not for the environment suffering immediate effects that propagate.<p>> And it&#x27;s actually humorous that you mention forest fires given that removing the brush that camp stoves like this burns helps prevent forest fires<p>Not in any significant way. As far as we know, forest fires are caused by weather patterns, forest life-cycles, insect life-cycles, ect. Clearing brush is a stop-gap fire fighters use to protect homes.<p>> As to being rough on the lungs, the whole point of this whole initiative is clean burning the wood, eliminating the vast majority of particulate that is the result of an incomplete burn.<p>The vast majority? I doubt either of us is going to do a study on this particular stove, but given that Biomass power facilities still produce large amounts of particulates, I&#x27;m pretty sure the little self-charging fan doesn&#x27;t solve the problem.<p>> I suspect you really don&#x27;t care about the actual facts though, but just for anyone else coming along.<p>I&#x27;m doing my best not to be confrontational, but your only &quot;fact&quot; is the misapplied notion that trees can only release carbon that they&#x27;ve previously absorbed. Every study I&#x27;ve read on using biomass for power generation has concluded that their only &quot;environmental&quot; advantage is that the fuel is easier to renew.",1405295060

(Look through their posts on HN when Lockitron was first announced and you&#x27;ll see that they admit that instant WiFi unlocking isn&#x27;t feasible yet that&#x27;s not the impression they gave the backers)<p>2- Determining intent (i.e. I want to unlock the door) through proximity is a fool&#x27;s errand. You&#x27;ll have an impossible time trying to get user&#x27;s position right without multiple receivers and have to resort to wonky logic they use today which won&#x27;t work for a vast number of people: if user A unlocks the door then ignore his phone until he exist... hmm what if user A enters with user B, or user A leaves though the car in the garage but wants come back through the door?<p>3- BUILD A PROPER PROTOTYPE. It means critical functionality being there, like unlocking via BLE and unlocking via WiFi. Does it work reliably? No? Fix it. Don&#x27;t promise anything! Don&#x27;t put up a video until you have a proper prototype.<p>Heck, you don&#x27;t even need mechanicals. Light up an LED to indicate unlocking for all anyone cares. If it doesn&#x27;t work here in your lab, it won&#x27;t work out there. There is no magic fairy dust that reduces power consumption or makes something work at scale when it doesn&#x27;t work in your lab.<p>4- Knowing how to use an Arduino doesn&#x27;t make you a product developer, just as knowing Javascript doesn&#x27;t mean you can deploy a backend that supports 1M users and you only get to deploy it once. Pay an experienced EE or consulting company for 20, 30, 40 hours of work to review your design, plan, and feasibility.<p>Done right Lockitron is about ~$25-$30 in parts + PCBA cost -- not considering mold amortization.<p>5- Cameron enumerates a number of mechanical and electrical problems. The fact is you can get a number of low cost electrical locks from China today that have reliable turning mechanisms. It has been done. Those factories will gladly OEM an  entire lock for you -- or in this case just sell you the parts or the whole assembled mechanism. Tear apart a Kwikset keypad lock and see how few gears it has. Their main problem seems to be that they started with the wrong/inefficient mechanical design and tried to make everything fit that.<p>There are lots of existing, inexpensive, gearboxes you can buy that would give you the torque you need. At worst you&#x27;d have to get a custom designed output gear. Even then there are many Chinese vendors who make gears. I&#x27;ve bought from them before. They have a large catalogue, and if you want something they don&#x27;t have NRE is about $1200 + 4 week delivery.<p>6- &quot;The resulting power and torque requirements of our gear box required a number of changes on our circuit board that would have been nearly impossible to predict from our prototype units&quot;. This could have been avoided by buying the ANSI/BHMA deadbolt standard which specifies maximum torque required for the thumbturn. Add 25% safety margin and you should be good with virtually all locks sold in north america as they are ANSI/BHMA compliant.",1405294561

Walking and/or bicycling home while drunk is a weekly Copenhagen pasttime, and pedestrian/bike fatalities are extremely rare. Since almost all pedestrian deaths are caused by cars, two simple expedients almost entirely eliminate them: 1) don&#x27;t have high-speed car traffic in the middle of a city; and 2) have a high standard of driver education, so drivers can reliably drive in a way that never hits pedestrians.",1405294033

The population density in steppe was so low, we could just drive until we&#x27;d run out of gas and water, and not meet anybody. I think we were shorter on water, as we had to use some of it to top up leaky radiators.\nAnyway, all ended well when our mechanic-guy found and fixed a simple wiring issue with the power converter, and we got the laptop back on!<p>So yes, you need GPS <i>and</i> maps.",1405292853

I will use all the available evidence to come to a reasonable conclusion.<p>Since the evidence is not that great (as it nearly always is in cases of rape) I will not instigate others to take action, but I will personally never buy any products from his company and I have no desire to ever met him in whatever setting.

Sure, short wait times are a nice bonus, but the primary problem with regular cabs isn&#x27;t the speed so much as the unpredictability.<p>The problem is that I can&#x27;t count on the voice-operated cab system.   I have to call, and then wait outside at the pickup point, with a 50% chance of the cab actually getting there, at which point you call and get another 50% chance of the cab getting there within 30 minutes, at which point you repeat.<p>I have no idea if it&#x27;s going to be 5 minutes or 120 minutes.   I have to stay outside, too, because they won&#x27;t call me when it&#x27;s there.<p>If a cab took an hour but I could set it up on my phone while I was still in the bar, and it would alert me when it got there?  That would be just fine with me.<p>Now, the local cab company could (and perhaps has, I have not checked lately)  create an app that does just this;  I don&#x27;t really mind waiting half an hour if I had some assurance that the car would be there in half an hour.",1405292650

It splits files into blocks (defaulting to 32KB, but that&#x27;s configurable), computes hashes (two separate hashes per block) and stores them in a file in the backup config directory.

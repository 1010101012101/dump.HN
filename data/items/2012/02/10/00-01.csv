After I point them at those pages, they generally disappear quietly, without an apology.  These same people see to be unable to fix any of these problem I've extensively documented, so I've grown less convinced of my own laziness and stupidity.<p>Maybe I'm just picky, since I want my hardware to work the way I naively expect; I don't want to have to ""work around"" bugs.  That's why I got into writing software, and why I prefer Linux _in the first place_.<p>I'd check the Ubuntu fora but the laptop reports are not done by many people; it's a bit sparse.

My rationale (which may very well be wrong):<p>1) Options offerings are typically a fraction of 1%: even for the first engineer at companies with no technical co-founders.  This (I think) is a carry-over from the dot-com era where IPO exits came hot and heavy.  These days, if you're lucky, you're looking at a low-7 to mid-8 figure exit.

3573985,comment,3573448,3573947,20,0,zasz,,,"Because it makes it sound like you're more interested in hitting on that person than interacting with them professionally. And unless you're inclined to call everyone, regardless of gender, ""sexy,"" it shows that you can't work with members of the opposite gender without putting a lot of emphasis on how bangable they are. Being called ""sexy"" tends to emphasize that you're a nicely arranged sack of meat, not a competent professional, and can make a woman (or man) think that your genitals are going to get in the way of a respectful working relationship. Not only that, but sexy people tend to be perceived as less competent. Just think of the ""blonde bimbo"" and ""unattractive female in software engineering"" stereotypes. Think about how dumb jocks get the high school cheerleader, and skinny, ugly nerds don't.<p>Now, I'm sure some men (or women) can successfully use that word to describe their colleagues and still work productively with them, but quite a few men can't. For an egregious example, see this profile about Sheryl Sandberg: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/07/11/110711fa_fact_auletta?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/07/11/110711fa_fact_...</a><p>""Dina Kaplan, the co-founder of Blip.tv, says that when she met with angel investors to raise funds she dressed nicely, and in a meeting with a potential funder he told her, Heres what we do, Dina. Were going to spend half the meeting with you pitching me, and half the meeting with me hitting on you!\nI felt nauseous, she says. I tried to laugh it off. I asked, Of all the things youre working on, what most excites you? He said, Seeing you naked tonight.""<p>When you've got men like that out there describing their female coworkers as sexy, you're going to have to work pretty hard to convince women not to lump you in with them. It's unfair, but that's how stereotypes work.",1328835307

They are starting to wade away from the river of crap that is brought on by greed and the evil nature to stand on the backs of others and keep the poor poor, where they think obviously that they should stay. If we raise the level of intelligence in our work force we can increase the level of our economy. We need intelligent people more than ever and we seem to be doing all we can to keep the poor from turning into something beautiful. Offer a hand up not a hand out!<p>I ask you. Do the poor have the money to buy the T.V. shows and movies that they download? No! Are the production industries really loosing money because these people are downloading these things? No! If the poor had the money to buy these things they would, as it is much better to own a blue ray disk or a book or even have the ability to stream what music they want before downloading than it is to have files on a computer for many reasons that they would have to wade through.<p>Imagine a world where the poor are aloud to download things to keep them from getting too depressed imagine a world where the poor are improving their brains using software and free books to learning new things. Not everyone can read a book from the library in two weeks and not everybody can treat a book with care. Its not hard to imagine. Would they want to damage their brains with too many drugs or too much of the same drug? No! They do this because they see no path out of their situation so they destroy themselves and the others around them in an attempt to feel better about their situation for a short time at least if not over the long haul like most alcoholics.<p>Why do the rich have to stand on the backs of the people and lord it over them with laws that they themselves were obviously the ones to originally influence? Why do we allow ancient laws that are based on different times to corrupt us when we know that the things we buy in the shops are better and that is truly what we want but others cant afford them.<p>The pirates are the greatest source of advertising that these producers have ever known and its all free to them. People whom pirate are actually doing the producers a great service and they are too greedy to see it that way. People will always change and the laws should always change with them to suit them not to hold them back from their true potential. Although I agree with most laws I do not agree with the copyright act that was originally written in 1968 and emended up to the date of 1990 something. It has had little improvements and little consideration for the lowest communities or the people effected just the producers. Why hasnt a system been devised where by a person can bring a hard disk to a video store or rental agency in order to rent a workable video format for a short period of time to phase out the use of such non bio degradable plastics? Why cant we go to a store and have our purchases put onto our hard disks with the premise that the file scans the hard disk so that the file may only be used from that hard disk and is write only? A simple new type of file system would be of great use here.<p>Let the poor have whatever they need to improve themselves and keep themselves happy let the rich be fined 60,500 dollars and receive up to five years imprisonment for what they have the ability to purchase because I know the people on the unemployment benefits have barely enough to feed themselves and resort to not eating in order to entertain themselves.  Let the old computers be reused by the poor in this fashion and not just become land fill. I know there are plenty of unemployed IT personnel up to the task.<p>Under the right conditions man will always strive to improve himself. If man sees no way out of his situation then of course he will be filled with rage and depression and maybe even do what he can to destroy himself because of self hatred for the actions he took or did not take that got him or her in that situation.<p>Half the under privileged out there who hurt people or perform illegal acts do so because they have little else to do and to them it is exciting or they gain something they would otherwise not have had. They are not smart enough to think of the effects of such injustice.<p>We could be doing what we can to keep the levels of crime down and be truly putting what people consider to be the evil members of society in jail where they belong but we are not! Our prisons are over stocked and it is just costing more and more for the society that we are trying to protect. Guess what the protection of society should start in peoples minds not in a prison!

I call BS on that.<p>Case and point:  Border radius and linear gradients made things better for EVERYONE.  Developers didn't have to create the html/js/css/image mess just to create rounded corners. This meant less code, less images, less css, which also translates to snappier websites. (and users like that.. there are studies that prove that)  This also meant that, as a company, we decided that IE had to live with a degraded experience until they made their browsers competitive with all the others. (and users had access to said browsers)<p>As a Front End Engineer, I find it insulting that you suggest we are doing it for ""fun"" or to make our resume look better.  This makes our lives better, and we have to consciously decide who gets a degraded experience and who gets the better experience.  I think we call that ""graceful degradation"" or ""progressive enhancement"".  You stated: ""They allow you to create novel effects which you can then discuss in your blog"", if these are novel effects then why do...<p>You state that websites are ""broken"" for non-webkit browsers on mobile. Well then maybe my definition of broken and yours differ.  I say a ""broken website"" is one where the content CANNOT be consumed by the end users.  Also if the end users have functionality that is broken, and therefore prevents them from accessing / modifying content.<p>I DO NOT think broken means, degraded visual experience.  When we decided that IE would get square corners, and flat background (instead of rounded corners and linear gradient backgrounds), we knew that IE would still be consuming the content just the same.<p>Therefore, please inform me which -webkit prefixed css is causing the breakage I define.  (where consumers are blocked from the content)<p>""This looks bad"", doesn't count.<p>Now granted, I'll give you that as developers, we should be using all prefixes that are supported.  It might be a pain in the ass, but that's our job.  I'm with you there, and I'm going through my current css to find if any are missing -ms, -o, -moz and the default fallback css.  Considering I use a preprocessor for my css, I'm pretty safe, except on my blog, (which has no preprocessor yet).  I suggest all of us developers do the same.  But this is a ""nice to have"" not the ""the mobile web is broken!"" as browser vendors are rallying.<p>Again, if you can prove to me, that the web is broken under my definition, I will take my words back for those specific css rules according to their proliferation on the web.",1328833170

3573854,comment,3572108,3573806,4,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Not just the ability to abstract, but the ability to think at a very granular level of detail and multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. Not many fields do that to the extent programming does.</i><p>Thank you for suggesting a generalized benefit of learning programming. My oldest son (grown up now) is a programmer, and maybe there is something to what you say. I'm glad he had early opportunities to learn Logo, C, and Scheme as part of thoughtful computer science curricula before he finished his high school education. Anyway, I'll encourage all of my children to go beyond the programming I reached decades ago with a time-sharing terminal running BASIC back in the 1970s.<p>But if I think about this issue of the educational benefits of learning this or that subject on multiple levels of abstraction, I wonder if the unique benefits of learning programming are really all that unique, and really all that generalizable to domains other than programming. I raise this question as someone whose last formal higher education was in law, a domain in which I practiced for a time, before turning my attention to specific issues of policy that are not all issues that raise legal questions. As I look at public policy discussions here on Hacker News, and especially at threads in which legal issues are discussed, I don't often have the pleasant experience of seeing multiple-level abstract thinking going on in those domains. Usually the comments here on HN about public policy or law look as elementary as my comments about programming must look to any experienced programmer. Many of the best comments about law on Hacker News, perhaps to no one's surprise, come from lawyers. Maybe the ability to think really abstractly (and correctly) on multiple levels is much more domain-specific than people who have been trained and practiced in one domain but not another usually acknowledge. Maybe part of domain-specific expertise is an ""ability to think at a very granular level of detail and multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously,"" without much transfer of that ability to other domains.<p>Knowing I am among learned people here who like to think, I'd be happy to hear the comments of any onlooker to this idea that learning is often stubbornly domain-specific.",1328832966

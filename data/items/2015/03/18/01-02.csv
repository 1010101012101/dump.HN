And the ErgoDox[2] also an amazing open source ergo mechanical keyboard.<p>Now, I plan create my own keyboard, some features i want:\n1. Bluetooth supported (BLE)\n2. Integrating Gestures Sensor. It supports left, right, up, down, wave, etc. It means I can control my app without mouse.\n3. Ergo, same as ErgoDox\n4. The main board which consists of BLE IC, power management etc is separate  from the Keyboard PCB.<p>Any advice?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://ergodox.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ergodox.org/</a>",1426643975

The Atreus layout uses fn to hit these keys instead of shift, but apart from learning a new location, it&#x27;s the same number of keystrokes. (There are no keys that require fn <i>and</i> shift to hit.) The only difference is that these keys on the Atreus layout are much closer to the home row, making them quicker to hit accurately.",1426643964

9223082,comment,9222364,9222924,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> What about liability? Today if a driver makes a mistake and hurts someone, the driver is responsible.<p>Most likely, liability will be addressed to some extent in statute authorizing general use of driverless vehicles, but there&#x27;s been quite a lot of analysis of this issue just based on generally applicable liability principles.<p>For one example, see <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/04/products-liability-driverless-cars-villasenor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/04/products-li...</a><p>> Even if a self-driving car is 10X safer than a human driver, that&#x27;s still equivalent to 10% of today&#x27;s insurance and litigation burden being shifted to automakers. Won&#x27;t this have a significant impact on the cost of autonomous cars?<p>At the numbers you give, not particularly. Let&#x27;s use that 10% number, and assume that the $124 billion paid out in 2013 was spread out over <i>just</i> the new cars sold in the US 2013, rather than all cars sold in 2013, or all cars on the road in 2013. 15.6 million cars were sold in that year, and we&#x27;ve got to spread $12.4 billion in additional automaker liability across them -- that&#x27;s less than $1,000 per car. (And, of course, if the automakers are taking all the liability, that means 100% of the cost of liability <i>insurance</i> to drivers goes away for driverless car purchasers, so the total cost to the consumer will be dramatically <i>lower</i>, even with the cost added to pay for the automaker&#x27;s liability burden.)",1426643411

I reckon it takes more effort to be politically correct and toe the popular line than to just state the obvious truth : \nAll across the globe, software engineers of value do amazing stuff everyday. They&#x27;re too busy doing the amazing stuff to be praising someone for doing what they do on a daily basis. The ones that aren&#x27;t doing amazing stuff can be found prostrating themselves to every tweet some high profile person makes because they don&#x27;t grasp the normalcy of coding at that level on a regular basis. Sadly this idolization is what is probably the biggest impediment to them progressing to the level of the person they praise.<p>For every Carmack, there&#x27;s 1000s of unspoken/unheard of people doing the same thing. I try to think of them, myself, and not get too excited...<p>Steve Jobs was Steve jobs because he thought different.\nYou&#x27;re not going to turn into him or Carmack by trying to emulate them or by following tweets and prostrating yourself.<p>P.S - the only reason why I commented is because I have friends who constantly give me updates about what Carmack is doing as if they&#x27;ve just had an encounter with God. I can&#x27;t help but think they are this way because they themselves have never coded at that level. Sadly, you don&#x27;t get to that level by going Gaga over another programmer. You get to that level by understanding that there is nothing amazing about what Carmack/etc does, digging into something you care about, and pushing your own personal limits... People don&#x27;t want to hear these kinds of things though as it necessarily compels them to action. They&#x27;d much rather rally around the superstar and put him/her on a chariot.

It&#x27;s already been covered how Unicode provides a number to symbol (i.e. codepoint) mapping; composition, rendering, input, etc. is left to the system implementation to determine.<p>I actually worked with Lee Collins (he was my manager) and a whole bunch of the ITG crew at Apple in the early 00&#x27;s. The critique that this was just a bunch of white dudes that only loved their own mother tongues but studied other languages dispassionately as a superficial proof of their right to determine an international encoding spec is, to me, misinformed, and DEEPLY offensive.<p>I had just gotten out of college and it was AMAZING to see how much these people loved language! Like it was almost weird. Our department had a very diverse linguistic background and, oftentimes, when you had a question about a specific language property you could just go down the hall and just ask &quot;Is this the way it should be?&quot;<p>All the discussion here happened on the unicode mailing lists as well as in passing at lunch and at team meetings. Lots of people felt VERY passionately about particular things; I just liked watching the drama. But to write an article like this that somehow intimates that people didn&#x27;t care is wrong. People cared A LOT.<p>It&#x27;s been touched in a couple of comments, but a big factor in Unicode was also the commercial viability of certain decisions. You have Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, etc with all of their previous attempts at internationalization/localization. If you wanted these large companies to adopt a new standard you had to give them a relative easy pathway to conversion and adoption.<p>I think the article, in general, lacks a perspective that dismisses the work of the Unicode team as well as the different stakeholders. Historically, accessible computing was birthed in the United States. The tools and processes are naturally Ameri-centric. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m just saying it is. The fact that the original contributors to Unicode were (mostly?)

To elaborate a bit, if you add a feature or API to the underlying OS, but there&#x27;s no corresponding browser feature that makes use of it, to someone who spends most of their time in a browser the OS feature may as well not exist. Microsoft&#x27;s main reason for investing in IE has generally been to try to add to the perceived value of Windows by making new Windows features accessible through the browser and thereby more relevant to web-centric PC usage. Examples are taskbar integration in Win7, live tile support in Win8, the emphasis on hardware acceleration in IE9+ (which was designed to try to make the underlying Windows graphics system more relevant to web browsing), smooth touch panning/zooming in IE10+ (by being early adopters of the Windows DComp/DManip APIs), better font rendering on high-DPI displays via DWrite etc.<p>Note that if other browsers themselves adopt new Windows APIs in competitive response, that actually still benefits Microsoft because ultimately they don&#x27;t care about the browser for its own sake, they care about increasing Windows API and feature usage across all browsers. But in practice competing browsers tend to be late adopters of new Windows stuff (e.g., even now nothing but IE supports DComp/DManip and Chrome is just very recently getting around to improving its Windows high-DPI and text rendering support), hence Microsoft funds IE.",1426641482

RC heli&#x27;s manage autorotation via their collective pitch, which RC quadcopters (or hexacopters) don&#x27;t have (collective). So it might not be relevant. But on the other hand, if the value of avoiding a crash is high enough, they could make the blades collective just for that purpose. Or maybe make one or two of the multiple props collective...

Types can be reasoned about just by looking at the code. Values can only be reasoned about when running code. A contrived example:<p><pre><code>    function foo(int $bar){...}\n\n    foo(36/$value);\n</code></pre>\nIn strict mode, this would be reported as an error by code analysis.<p>For the coercive scalar type proposal, this code works - except when it doesn&#x27;t. This code works when $value = 1, 2, 3, 4 and breaks when $value = 5.<p>This is the fundamental difference; whether conversions between types have to be explicitly done by code, and so any implicit or incorrect conversion can be detected by static code analysis tools, or whether the conversions are done at run time, and so cannot be analyzed fully.<p>This means most of these errors will be discovered by users on the production servers. Strict mode allows you to eliminate these types of errors.<p>Yes, this means I need to add a bit of code to do the explicit conversion, but I just don&#x27;t convert between values that much. Once a value is loaded from a users request, config file or wherever, it is converted once into the type it needs to be. After that, any further change in type is far more likely to be me making a mistake, rather than an actual need to change the type.<p>> Any idea why it was rejected so badly? Is it because the coercion rules are different from the rest of PHP?<p>At least in part it was because the RFC was seen as a way to block strict types; about half of the RFC text is shitting on people desires for strict types, which did not make people who want strict types be very receptive. If it had been brought up 6 months ago, there is a good chance it would have passed, or at least would have been closer.<p>Some parts of the proposal were good - other parts were nuts that were pretty obvious the result of the RFC only being created once the dual mode RFC was announced and about to be put to the vote, with a very high chance of passing.<p>* Good - &quot;7 dogs&quot; not longer being converted to &quot;7&quot; if someone tries to use it as an int.<p>* Bad - Different mode for internal function vs userland functions e.g. &quot;Unlike user-land scalar type hints, internal functions will accept nulls as valid scalars.&quot; and other small differences. This is even more nuts than you might realise as it means if you extend an internal class, and overload some of the methods on the class, those methods will behave differently to the non-overloaded methods.<p>* Bad - Subtle and hard to fix BC breaks in conversion which are probably not right anyway. e.g.\n    false -> int           # No more conversion from bool\n    true -> string         # No more conversion from bool<p>It is a shame that the discussion became so contentious. It would have been good if the conversion rules could have been tidied up, but all the time and energy had been used up the not particularly productive discussion.",1426640692

I spend about $350/month for the Metro North train ride from Connecticut into NYC, and half the time am riding in the 40-year old cars with dilapidated, uncomfortable seats. The NYC subway just bumped up its rates to $2.75/ride, which means I&#x27;m spending around $115/month for the subway. All that, and it takes me two hours door-to-door.<p>I live in Connecticut because the houses are slightly more affordable and my kids can go to decent public schools.

Such functions and methods tend to accomplish easily understandable things. And by &quot;important&quot; I mean something that is fundamental to what the system accomplishes.<p>Then you dive.<p>Your goal is to have a decent understanding of how this fundamental thing is accomplished. You start at the public facing function, then find the actual implementation of that function, and start reading code. If things make sense, you keep going. If you can&#x27;t make sense of it, then you will probably need to start diving into related APIs and - most importantly - data structures.<p>This process will tend to have a point where you have dozens of files open, which have non-trivial relationships with each other, and they are a variety of interfaces and data structures. That&#x27;s okay. You&#x27;re just trying to get a feel for all of it; you&#x27;re not necessarily going for total, complete understanding.<p>What you&#x27;re going for is that Aha! moment where you can feel confident in saying, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done.&quot; This will tend to happen once you find those fundamental data structures, and have finally pieced together some understanding of how they all fit together. Once you&#x27;ve had the Aha! moment, you can start to trace the results back out, to make sure that is how the thing is accomplished, or what is returned. I do this with all large codebases I encounter that I want to understand. It&#x27;s quite fun to do this with the Linux source code.<p>My philosophy is that &quot;It&#x27;s all just code&quot;, which means that with enough patience, it&#x27;s all understandable. Sometimes a good strategy is to just start diving into it.",1435326968

In terms of science and technology, you can have something which is measurably better. With personal preferences, the argument is that something is better if someone likes it better. I&#x27;d argue that this latter use of better holds little weight. Words have meaning when they act to convey a message, saying something is better when it&#x27;s just something you prefer carries a weak message as it doesn&#x27;t align with the &#x27;measurably better&#x27; meaning that&#x27;s commonly understood.

For example, I am ignorant of what it would truly feel like to kill someone, but am glad that such knowledge has eluded me. What little I know is enough to stop actively seeking to find out.<p>Rejecting ignorance completely means knowledge is always seen as a good, regardless of how or why it is obtained. I would argue that intention and purpose are very important. The intention to discover new ways to kill people is part of what certain science and engineering fields aid, regardless of whether these groups are deluded enough to believe that knowledge is always assured of its purity, and therefore feel no guilt.<p>4. Nuclear weapons have not stopped war, the actors involved in these wars either lack the resources to operate on a multinational scale or choose to fight war without declaring it.

If I can break it (and I am good at finding bugs, so I usually can) then I now have a narrow focus which helps me getting &quot;lost&quot; in the code base.<p>Once I&#x27;ve found and fixed a few things, or if the code base is particularly small or clean that I can&#x27;t find bugs to fix, I&#x27;ll set about hacking in the feature I&#x27;d like.<p>I usually start by doing it in the most hacky way possible. That sounds like a bad approach but it narrows the search of how to implement it and means I&#x27;m not constraining myself to fit the code base that I don&#x27;t yet appreciate.<p>In hacking that feature I&#x27;ll often break a few things through my carelessness. In then trying to alter my hacked approach so it no longer breaks stuff I&#x27;ll become more aware of the wider code base from the point of view of my initial narrow focus. This lets me build up the mental model.<p>Eventually I&#x27;ll be comfortable enough I can re-write the feature in a way more consistent with the wider code base.<p>I don&#x27;t normally start by trying to &quot;read all the code&quot; because that guarentees I won&#x27;t understand much of it (I&#x27;m not quick at picking up function from code). I might have a skim if it is well organised, but I find the &quot;better&quot; written a lot of stuff is, the harder it is to grok what it is actually doing from reading it. to me, reading good code is often like trying to read the FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition[1].<p>I&#x27;ve worked on many legacy systems: I was last year implementing new features into a VB6 code base, this year (at a different job) I am helping migrate from asp webforms to a more modern system.

In general I like to try to force myself to learn only the minimum required to do what I need to do.  If that philosophy sounds good to you, I would recommend taking the buggy version of frozen columns and try to fix the bugs.  You may learn that the bugs are structural and you need to implement it differently, or you might be able to fix it with minimal changes.  You will certainly get an understanding of the parts of slickgrid that you need to interact with to add this feature.<p>For the ajax data source thing, I would try to modify or extend the existing data source code to add the behavior you are looking for.  As you mess around with it trying to figure out what you need to change, you will encounter the areas of the code that you need to understand.<p>With this sort of strategy you can avoid having to fully understand all the code while still being able to modify it.  You might end up implementing stuff in a way which is not the best, but you will probably be able to implement it faster.

The underlying things to remember are that a) while cyclists are expected to obey the same traffic laws as operators of other vehicles, sometimes there are safety reasons to violate them, and b) the light weight and low speed of bicycles means that while cyclists are vulnerable to harm from motorists, motorists are not vulnerable to harm from cyclists.<p>Red lights: cyclists should stop for all red lights, but should not necessarily be expected to wait for the light to turn green before proceeding[0]. This is partly because of sensor-activated lights that may never register the presence of a bicycle, and partly because it can be safer by separating the cyclist from traffic waiting at the red. You should also pay attention to how many motorists run red lights (usually for 1-2 seconds after they turn) and stop signs.<p>Crosswalks: cyclists should slow down for crosswalks. Remember, though, that &quot;full speed&quot; on a bicycle is nothing like full speed in a car. You should pay attention to how many motorists also speed through crosswalks.<p>Not signalling turning: cyclists should signal all turns <i>unless</i> they are in a situation where they need both hands on the handlebars. As a motorist, you may not be in a position to judge when that is.<p>Not using bike lane: in most jurisdictions, cyclists are encouraged but not required to use the bike lane. There are good reasons in some cases for not using the bike lane. A bike lane that is next to on-street parking may place cyclists in the door zone[1], making it more dangerous than taking the lane. Bike lanes may also accumulate road debris and be unsafe to ride in.<p>Hope this helps explain some of why cyclists ride the way they do.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_zone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_zone</a>",1435324694

Obviously your answer is going to be contingent on the kind of work that you do.<p>Some background: What&#x27;s motivating me to ask is that I am flirting with the idea of trying to add a couple of features to SlickGrid (https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), Michael Leibman&#x27;s phenomenal javascript grid widget. Unfortunately Leibman got busy and isn&#x27;t actively supporting it anymore.<p>The codebase is something like 8k lines of javascript, so it&#x27;s not ludicrously big, but I&#x27;m kind of intimidated thinking about trying to make sense of it. My first strategy is just to open up important-looking javascript files (slick.core.js, slick.grid.js) and read through for comprehension. This seems like a pretty slow way to build a mental model of the code, though. Some features I want to implement are 1. an ajax data source that doesn&#x27;t require paging, and 2. frozen columns. Someone else has implemented a buggy version of frozen columns (and since abandoned the project), and I might like to use it, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s buggy because it&#x27;s a hard problem, or because their implementation strategy was poor (or both!). So at the moment I can&#x27;t evaluate if I should implement my own, or try to fix the issues with theirs.<p>Picking up other people&#x27;s code seems to be one of the harder tasks developers face, as evidenced by how much code gets abandoned, so I wondered if the voices of experience on here could point me in the right direction, either by talking about this problem in particular, or more generally, how you build knowledge about a new codebase.<p>Thanks!",1435324027

I normally work exclusively on macs & gnu/linux boxen, and when recently doing a stint in a windows 7 pro environment was in utter disbelief that plugging in a USB keyboard or mouse could occasionally require waiting over a minute before it became usable, often with a popup saying, &quot;new drivers installed, you should probably restart&quot; or similar.   The environment is a bit odd - on a ship, so restricted internet and permissions, but even still.

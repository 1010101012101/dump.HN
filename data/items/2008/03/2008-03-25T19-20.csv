This is done in order to get past the ""human spam filter."" If you run stupidity detection based purely on the contents of their comments then you run the risk of simply banning controversial topics or people with bad spelling instead of controversial (trolling, roughly) behavior.<p>To better detect trolling behavior, I'd focus on responses:<p>- Content of the responses. Lots of shouting? Length.<p>- Number of responders. 50x more replies than you would otherwise expect from the thread?<p>- Depth of thread. Conversation still dragging on after all sane people have left?<p>- Timing of responses. Heated arguments leave no time for cooling off.<p>So measure effect of the troll, and your system won't have to try to understand what he's saying.<p>+ But you were referring to ""stupid"" measuring based on the submitters data may work just fine.",1206475187

Is this really relevant now?<p>I will tack on that the framework will not make or break your idea.  The advantage of one framework over another should be weighed in how long it takes your team to go to market; this translates into asking your development team (or yourself) what they (or you) can handle in the coming months in anticipation of the project taking off.  Also your code should be done in such a way that you can ditch whatever framework you currently use for something better suited for what your future requirements might be.<p>I will add that I believe TurboGears to be the better platform all around, but am sticking to Rails because:<p>1) I like Ruby/Rails<p>2) I don't have the time/energy to dive into Python/TurboGears<p>3) I can implement something by myself confidently in Rails RIGHT NOW, as opposed to a few months down the road after getting comfy with Python (while at the same time maintaining my day job and OTHER life responsibilities)",1206475086

Not much of a user until the multi-user systems came along, with 8 or even 16 modems at a time, on multiple phone lines -- those were much more interesting.<p>I remember that in my freshman year of college one of the primary uses of my awesome 10Mbit fiberoptic dorm-room Ethernet connection was to telnet to an open machine at Ohio State that happened to have an outgoing modem that you could use to make local BBS phone calls in Columbus.

Unfortunately the packaging did not contain a disclaimer saying that the computer interface did not work like every other MP3 player ever sold. Apple will never fool me twice.<p>2) I can see if AT&T somehow subsidized the phone, the lock-in would be fair, but it doesn't. Apple got the exclusive contract only so it could get extra cash above and beyond the original purchase price. This is about as consumer-friendly as the crapware that is preinstalled on most PC's.<p>3) Equating Apple's practices to Microsoft's practices only strengthens my argument.<p>4) It has nothing to do with CPU cycles or battery life.

If you just wanted a mp3 player then get a cheap Asian one but complaining about how the iPod isn't right for you just seems like a waste of your time and God's time.<p>2. AT&T signed the partnership contract while T-Mobile and Verizon didn't. You're obviously a man of very important stature, you should give those CEOs a ring to get this resolved.<p>3. Apple Updates is a delivery platform for updates AND software. Last I recall, using Windows XP's update feature they would push software to me all the time too. How's that IE7 uninstall process going?<p>4. Flash churns up quite a lot of CPU cycles. That leads to battery usage. Which leads to unhappy users. Oh, since you're an arbiter of technology you can help me solve this problem: how do you create an interface for Flash applications to recognize your fat finger tips as a single pixel mouse pointer or how to make multitouch work on a Flash application without creating false positive contacts? Oh, wait, it might actually require some time and knowledge with iPhone's interface? No wonder that's why they opted to push that webapp solution instead and how everything on the iPhone are BIG BLOCKS or BIG BUTTONS? As for Java, you got me there.<p>You also must be new to Apple ideology. Apple as a company pushes innovation and it does so at the expense of its small user base. But at the same time, if it was up to the majority to decide on when to start using the mouse, stop using floppy disks, start using CD-ROM, and start using USB well... it'll be never.

This is even the case for ""impractical"" knowledge.  Usually this kind of knowledge is of principles instead of techniques for doing X.  Principles are useful to know because A) they are what techniques are derived from so now people can derive their own techniques and B) there is innate satisfaction from the beauty and elegance in the principles behind things.  Since everything we do is for the sake of some kind of happiness, knowledge qualifies as something like sex or entertainment, activities people engage in for their own sake.<p>Those, like yourself, who deride people for asking about ""practicality"" and ""applicability"" probably really do think knowledge is useful for the reasons I outlined.

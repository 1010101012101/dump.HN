For someone who's a Steve Jobs, the application questions provide a natural opportunity to market yourself.<p>(My first answer was going to be ""If you have to ask you're not the Jobs"", but I'm working on tact in my comments.)\n",1175175559

Family to support<p>I'd love to found a startup, but having a wife, two wonderful kids, and a $500K mortgage give you a very different perspective on the startup lifestyle.<p>I imagine a startup incubator where the founders are provided with salary and benefits comparable to working for a corporation, and they are encouraged (forced?) to maintain a reasonable life/work balance,  (The latter is probably the hardest to achieve; a startup requires an almost monomaniacal focus). <p>In return,the incubator would gain access to a pool of talented people who would otherwise not be able to make the leap.<p>Is this being done now? <p>",1175175484

Perhaps default text that started with ""We would like to speak..."". <p>Because all the blurbs start out like that, I found it hard to skim over the list (hence the blurry comment).<p>This may not be your problem, it may just be that all your buyers are just copying each other. Does that explain my comment any better?

66092,comment,65936,65936,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I settled on Mountain View, and have been happy with the choice.  The downtown, despite aspersions on its character by alaskamiller, is actually quite nice.  More Asian food than you can shake a stick at (some of it very good), a couple of great little Asian markets (I just got back from one of them, where I bought everything I needed for a good vegetable soup, some Jasmine green tea, and some nice looking apples for cheap).  Having shopping, and especially restaurants, within easy walking distance is now my primary concern in choosing where to live.<p>I'm renting a house a few blocks from Castro St., and I like the whole town quite a lot.  It's not San Francisco, and right now, that's probably good--I would go to rock shows three or four times a week if I could walk to the club.  I've got work to do right now, and don't need the distraction.  Presumably, if you're starting up, you also have work to do.<p>That said, being around other startups has value, too.  The YC guys often get together in the city, and I'd love to go, but I rarely have a car handy (and I hate driving/parking in the city, anyway).  If I lived nearby, I'd walk, or catch a bus.  But taking the train (which stops running at a ridiculously early hour) from here to there isn't an option.  Once things are spinning nicely, I'll probably move to the city, or possibly back to Austin.",1192062821

There are plenty of people outside of our Web 2.0 echo chamber who pay a lot more attention to old media than new media.<p>Profile your buyers/users, understand where they spend their time, and make sure that you've got good visibility there.",1192062290

66083,comment,65936,66076,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"In my mind I kind of lumped Redwood City, and that whole Atherton area, in with Palo Alto. Redwood City indeed is a very nice place, there's decent housing, a friend of mine whose parents are pastors were able to buy a house with a pool, and there's this atmosphere around that particular area that's just unique. I think it's a combination of expensive cars, luxury housing, and smart people that makes me want to do better. <p>East Menlo Park is kind of ghetto though. ",1192061954

The downtown is small, but beautiful with many restaurants most of them have outside seating because the weather is so nice. Actually, Redwood City uses the slogan ""Climate best by government test"". And I would agree; we got only 3 cloudy days in the last 4 months. It's not too hot and not too cold. And, it's not as expensive as other places. As for location, it's close to the 101, and it's half-way between San Francisco and Sunnyvale, so you're not too far for any event in the city or the valley. ",1192060838

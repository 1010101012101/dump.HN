1218091,comment,1217459,1217763,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"More interesting is the MPEG-LA quote itself. Gruber summarises it as "" MPEG-LA has stated that they believe otherwise"" i.e. MPEG-LA have claimed that Theora uses their patents. What the CEO actually says is intended to give that impression, but never actually says it:<p><i>""In addition, no one in the market should be under the misimpression that other codecs such as Theora are patent-free.""</i><p>This is a beautifully crafted sentence because Theora isn't patent free, it just so happens that all the patents we know about are licenced freely for anyone to use. (Similarly VP6, 7, 8 are all presumably patented but Google now owns those patents and can do what they like with them.)<p>""<i>Virtually all codecs are based on patented technology""</i><p>Again, whose patents are we talking about here? On2/Google's, MPEG-LAs?, some random trolls? It is left unspecified.  And which codecs? Not all of them, only ""virtually"" all.<p>""<i>and many of the essential patents may be the same as those that are essential to AVC/H.264.</i>""<p>Keyword ""may"", as in ""might not"", or as in I'm very carefully not saying what you think I'm saying by adding qualifiers.<p>""<i>Therefore, users should be aware that a license and payment of applicable royalties is likely required to use these technologies developed by others, too.</i>""<p>There's a ""likely"" which you'd think is stronger than a ""may"" but only applies <i>if</i> you are using technologies developed by others. So this ""likely"" depends on you accepting the ""may"" in the previous sentence.<p>""<i>MPEG LA would consider offering on additional licenses that would make these rights conveniently available to the market under a single license as an alternative to negotiating separate licenses with individual patent holders.</i>""<p>This is just stating the MPEG-LA business model, batching up patent rights for easier licencing. It does not say that the hypothetical patent owners are currently part of any MPEG patent pool.",1269513748

It would be interesting to know whether he has any actual grounds for making that claim, other than the fact that the MPEG LA are spreading FUD to that effect.<p><i>And if you’re not willing to concede that Ogg Theora is vulnerable to patent claims, well, then I doubt you’re reading this.</i> It appears that Gruber thinks it's so obvious to any reasonable person that Ogg Theora is ""vulnerable to patent claims"" that the only people who would disagree are those closed-minded enough that they would avoid reading a different opinion.<p>Of course ""vulnerable to patent claims"" is weasel language. Almost everything is ""vulnerable to patent claims"" in the sense that you can't know for sure that at any moment someone won't emerge from the woodwork and claim they've got a patent on it. But: for H.264 it's <i>known</i> that there are people claiming to have patents on the technology, namely the MPEG LA; and it's <i>known</i> that they demand payment for (certain kinds of) using it. For Theora no such thing is known, its creators have disclaimed patent rights, and it's been around for a long time without anyone making such claims. For both H.264 and Theora it's <i>also possible</i> that at some point in the future someone might come forward and say ""oh, by the way, I own this and this and this; please pay me $1M/year or get sued"".<p>But if someone is trying to choose betwen Theora and H.264 on the basis of their patent situation, it's daft to say (as Gruber does) that the only consideration is that possibility of getting torpedoed by submarine patents. The big difference in the situation with <i>known</i> patents is obviously relevant too.",1269512397

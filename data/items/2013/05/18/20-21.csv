People will try to convince you that X language is better than Y language but really it's your choice.<p>Now you've chosen a language, go and find some basic tutorials. Start with 'Hello World' (as per tradition) then work your way up, make a counter, make a calculator, make a clock. Just keep on doing these basic projects.<p>Soon enough you'll start to get bored. You'll start finding these projects easy. You'll no longer have to look up every line of code to work out what syntax to write, you'll just get used to it. Once you get to this stage, start looking for what other people have done. Look for a basic application that someone else has created and start to work out how they made it, their programming style. Once you've worked it out, try modifying the program. Trial and Error. Try to change what the program does, try adding on new functionalities.<p>Finally, create a big project from scratch. Start with an idea, it can be simple but try and make it challenging. Work out how each part is going to work, how you're going to code each bit. Then just get programming.<p>Once your first project is done, you'll most likely have another idea, and another. You'll keep on programming new things, each project learning something new.<p>That (at least in my opinion) is how to learn to program.",1368910685

I have found a taskbar is the least worst way of dealing with lots of windows, especially if there are multiple ones from the same app.  It is important that the taskbar allow reordering and hover to raise (eg for drag and drop).  Being horizontal also means that mouse travel distance isn't too far even from the furthest points - a problem for desktops that focus on the top left corner.<p>I've repeatedly tried Gnome 3 shell and even the 3.8 classic mode.  They always fail due to not having a functional taskbar.  Notifications are also completely messed up - I can't figure out why you would want them hidden!  Most bizarre are things like the system monitor being in the hidden notification area - in what way does that make any sense?<p>I've tried other environments and just didn't like them - eg KDE (too busy), LXDE (too spartan), Cinnamon (I like other Gnome 3 advancements).",1368910517

Do we really want to look back 10 years from now and see that we picked some crooked-n-twisted subset of JS to be the bytecode to which native code is compiled, just because ""hey it's JS and it already works"". Have we learned nothing from decades of horrible backwards-compatibility laden platforms?<p>If one would design a portable bytecode today, would he come up with asm.js? Not in a lifetime (or two). PNaCl is way, way closer to a sane design for such a bytecode. Yes, it has its problems, but these appear to be incremental and can be solved with investment of time and effort (which Google seem to be willing to invest). In its _core_, PNaCl is the right approach to this problem. It uses a subset of the hugely successful and important LLVM IR to represent bytecode. IR that's way more suitable for the task than a subset of JS. And the sandboxing model PNaCl uses also makes way more sense than asm.js's use of typed arrays to represent the heap. Where is your memory model, asm.js? Do you think it's an easy problem to solve? I don't see threads with shared memory coming to asm.js in _years_, while PNaCl already has them. Say what you will, but threads are important. Games use them all over the place, and other applications too.<p>Remember, speed means battery life for phones and tablets (it's only a matter of time until PNaCl runs on Android, who doubts it?) So 2x native vs. 1.15x native is a huge difference.<p>Again, as a hacker I can see the coolness of asm.js and kudos to Mozilla for creating it. It's a great interim approach to ensure that native code can truly run everywhere, in all browsers. But looking into the future, I hope it will die and PNaCl (or some derivative of PNaCl) will take over. Even today it lets you compile C++ code and run at nearly native speed with threads on several architectures and several OSes, in a secure way! Other browsers should definitely adopt it. Although I understand if Google doesn't worry much about it - Chrome is the most popular browser today, and its lead is growing. Lack of adoption from other browsers may end up being _their_ problem, not Google's.",1368910173

(Or, if the site isn't using SSL, just sniff the network traffic.) CSRF just transmits the legitimate cookies to the server - but with a request the victim probably didn't want to actually send. At no point are the victim's cookies able to be harvested.<p>You could indeed possibly forge a request after harvesting session cookies - but that isn't CSRF. It's either XSS or traffic snooping.<p>One way to cut down the (time) window of opportunity for an attack is to have the server generate new session tokens, and store them in the cookie, on each request, but require a valid token in order for a new token to be generated. If you have an XSS vulnerability, this is not an adequate solution, as it requires the victim to submit another request between the time the attacker steals the cookie and the time the attacker submit the cookie to the server.<p>So basically, use SSL and be really careful about XSS. You can trust the REFERER header and session cookies <i>together</i> if and only if they are both present. ""Never trust user input that you have to escape or that will be rendered to the browser"" is very reasonable though.",1368908871

I think my point about repaying the loan and changing perception toward perception is largely geared toward conservative lawmakers and politicians.  Some (like Romney and Palin) have grouped Tesla with the likes of Solyndra, calling them ""losers"".  Even some of the public have the perception that Tesla received bailout money (which isn't true because the DOE loan is separate).  But for the public it was around the same time as the government bailout of GM, etc.  So, paying off the loan clears up misperceptions, and this can help their case with being able to sell directly to consumers in states such as Texas and N Carolina (with their bills being voted on).<p>2.  Totally agree Tesla was smart to do it now and agree that execution isn't guaranteeing success.  But money in the hands of a wise person can really accelerate a roadmap and enlarge success.  I personally think Tesla is at an inflection point where the money will be very well spent and will accelerate growth and demand.<p>3.  Regarding Elon Musk's purchase, it's true he's borrowing a bunch of money but even that still signals his confidence in the stock and its current price.  And I think that's overall good to ensure investors since the stock has been very volatile of late.<p>4.  It's true investment banks have made terrible mistakes in the past, but still lots of investors and institutions are influenced by the top investment banks.

Lots of institutions and funds are starting to invest in TSLA and this is providing upward pressure on the stock over time (especially if TSLA keeps meeting/surpassing expectations.<p>The next big milestone for Tesla is reaching 25% gross margin (which is rarely had in the auto industry).

The core UI element (a thin wrapper around the native WebView) is easily replicated in less than 100 lines of code. The plugins I used were very inconsistent between Android and iOS, so in the end I spent a lot of time either wrapping them in JavaScript to make them consistent, or (re)implementing missing plugins on one platform or another (or both where they were substandard).<p>Yeah, it lowers the barrier to entry if you are a web developer looking to wrap your web site up as a native app, but if you have even basic skills in your target platform(s)  it's very easy to replicate its functionality and you get finer control over how it starts up (which was an issue for one app I made) and your distribution file will be much smaller.<p>Would I use HTML5 to create hybrid apps again? For the right project, absolutely. I think other people have mentioned that there's currently no ""one size fits all"" solution on mobile, and JavaScript frameworks, associated tooling, and mobile browsers are definitely still in their infancy when it comes to building full-blown client-side HTML5 applications. This is one space where things are happening incredibly quickly, and even with  what's available today(1), you can get acceptable results. For a small-medium sized business that simply doesn't have the money to develop and maintain applications targeting every platform (including web) hybrid development is a very appealing option.<p>(1) disclaimer: after some investigation of Backbone/Angular I was unimpressed with their ASP/JSP on the client model and rolled my own MVC framework, but literally millions would say I was wrong to do so",1368908629

As a post-doc you aren't expected to keep that job forever, whereas lab techs do so for decades.<p>You seem really disgruntled about the current system. Academia isn't easy, considering the limited funding available, it is in national interest to only have the best doing research and your CV isn't exactly super competitive.<p>Edit: The vast majority of younger faculty I've worked with (i.e. Assistant Professors with < 5 years of experience at the University of Toronto only did post docs for 4-6 years in total.

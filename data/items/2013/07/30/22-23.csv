As others have pointed out, you&#x27;re talking about mrmoneymustache.com but you&#x27;re not very accurate. The guy/family essentially has $1 Million (probably more) in assets (paid-off house, rental properties, stock accounts, etc.) and lives off of $25-30K that these assets generates. Given that he doesn&#x27;t have the worries of paying a rent or mortgage, that he has optimized his location for quality of life, he shows how a basic middle-class life, but with total freedom from work, can be had on that budget. But he&#x27;s also the first to tell you he actually likes to &quot;work&quot; on his own terms (house renovation, blogging, etc.) and that these things bring him income that is just further accumulating. He actually could draw more to live every year, but doesn&#x27;t. So in addition to a decent lifestyle, he also has financial security, which I bet a lot of people would want.<p>I do think there are some aspects of MMM&#x27;s success that are not generalizable, mostly the carpentry/contracting skills and the rental property income that are a direct result of them. But the idea that on a 100K salary (say 70K after taxes), you live on 30K and save 40K for 10 years gives you a very comfortable nest egg that will compound and generate income for you is very real.<p>Another part of MMM&#x27;s message, if I may, is that a non-consumer, active lifestyle (during both the savings phase or the &quot;retirement&quot; phase) is more rewarding personally and more sustainable socially. You say &quot;it&#x27;s not the life most people want to live,&quot; but one argument is that they haven&#x27;t tried it because they are steeped in the mass-media consumer culture.<p>Personally, the OP (&quot;a passive income hacker&#x27;s view on wealth&quot;) is a no brainer (of course we all want time, and maybe a meaningful task in life), and I was really surprised he didn&#x27;t tell us how to obtain that time.

That page could simply provide you one of 3 (or more) options to select.<p>So, giving people the correct file instead of making them know what they need (which many people dont... especially if it is browser specific) is not a good reason? What if a server wants to provide a client with native order endianess (for RPC for example), that shouldnt be allowed?<p>> Date headers are not useful for that purpose. Expiration would be based on the time of the UA, not the one given by a server.<p>Tell that to my browser which countless times doesnt fetch a new file because it has a cached copy. Furthermore, if the headers are stored with the cached copy, there is no server/client time problem because you can calculate the difference between server time and client time.<p>> The session should be ephemeral and not matter anyway, so there is no reason for it to be signed.<p>This is correct in idea, but not in practice. Often times, the server isnt a single server, but rather a set of load-balanced servers. When this happens, it is hard to keep track of client state because a client might get load-balanced to another machine on its next request. Therefore, client state is kept with the client (and signed to make sure that it is legitimate). This sort of behavior has become necessary, although can be better dealt with with some sort of standard (esp. to ensure the protection of the cookie et cetera).",1375223552

It seems like a private git server should be allowed, after all. But that was just a draft. Franklin doesn&#x27;t mention any room for exceptions, though:<p>> The server policy has been established to account for the congestion management and network security needs of Google Fiber&#x27;s network architecture.<p>Okay, so &quot;reasonable network management&quot; is justified by &quot;congestion management and network security needs&quot;. But then I read the FCC&#x27;s 2008 decision concerning Comcast&#x27;s BitTorrent RST abuse [3], and right there on the first page:<p>>> We consider whether Comcast, a provider of broadband Internet access over cable lines, may selectively target and interfere with connections of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications under the facts of this case. Although Comcast asserts that its conduct is necessary to ease network congestion, we conclude that the company&#x27;s discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible Internet and does not constitute reasonable network management.<p>So the FCC has indeed set precedent that a necessity to &quot;ease network congestion&quot; does not necessarily outweigh &quot;the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible Internet&quot;. Franklin makes more than one reference to a certain Preserving the Open Internet Broadband Industry Practices document [4]. I found this reference incredibly brazen. Franklin claims this server issue was specifically discussed. In the document, Google actually argues<p>> The threat that wireless networks may develop into fundamental non-neutral platforms is real. For example, the terms imposed by most major wireless carriers purport to prohibit the use of, at minimum: ... server or host applications. ... All of these actions threaten user choice and freedom online, and adopting network neutrality rules for wireless networks will allow the Commission to take action against these kinds of practices in the future.<p>What the hell? Google specifically advised the FCC to disallow what Franklin specifically says is industry standard. Google is playing a Dark Knight here: the laws are bad, and Google wants everyone to feel the full force of bad law. I can&#x27;t applaud them for playing the status quo so hard like this, and now that they&#x27;re moving into the ISP sector it&#x27;s getting more and more dissonant to hear them claim they&#x27;re powerless over industry standards.<p>Lastly, I can&#x27;t find the forum thread described by the Wired article, &quot;But in the Google Fiber forums, employees assure subscribers the rules aren&#x27;t meant to apply to Minecraft servers.&quot; I think this kind of deception is heinous. The employees can&#x27;t say what their legal department will or will not state. They&#x27;re maintaining a false PR stance that is simply misleading: Google (Darah Franklin) has clearly stated Google Fiber disallows servers. Tricking the public to think they are in the clear to run a Minecraft server is perhaps well-intentioned but just doesn&#x27;t jive with &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://lwn.net/images/pdf/google_fiber_response_to_mcclendon_complaint__as_filed_072913.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/images/pdf/google_fiber_response_to_mcclendon...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-294159A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-294159...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-08-183A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-08-183...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/fp-legacy/FP_Comments_wireless_and_managed_services_10_12_2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/fp-legacy/FP_Co...</a>",1375223494

6130512,comment,6129669,6129669,7,0,sehrope,,,"Both raw SQL and using an ORM have their place. The latter is definitely less prone to unintended SQL injections but it&#x27;s still possible. The reverse is true too. Raw SQL can be quite secure if you&#x27;re not an idiot about it (golden rule: <i>never build command strings from user input</i>). If you use prepared statements across the board you don&#x27;t even have to bother with sanitizing user input[1].<p>The main reason to use an ORM is for programmer efficiency. Sure I can write a bunch of CRUD operations but why bother if I can have the ORM do it for me? Since CRUD operations are either inserting a new row or accessing/updating by a primary key it&#x27;ll be indexed as well so no perf issues[2]. The additional work by your app code for the ORM library is meaningless compared to the DB round trip anyway. My favorite part? Adding a new field goes straight to the model and nowhere else[3].<p>The big place for raw SQL is as the secret sauce on the meat and potatoes of your apps. Once you&#x27;ve got a real data set and you want to combine, slice, dice, you&#x27;re not going to do that through an ORM. You want those queries to be as performant as possible. If you&#x27;ve structured your tables properly (proper foreign keys, normalization, etc) then the writing custom SQL will also be much more straightforward then trying to kludge together ORM commands to do what you want. On top of that, the work will happen on the database where it can filter it prior to your app processing it.<p>For our app[4] most of the CRUD pages are handled by an ORM but there&#x27;s quite a bit of custom SQL too. One example is for security authorizations. Validating security authorizations (can user X access DB y) is a hierarchical check. The logic is all done in a Postgres stored proc (well technically a function). Doing it via an ORM would inefficient, both in programmer time and computer runtime.<p>[1]: You probably <i>should</i> though. It&#x27;s generally a good idea to have some kind of white listing for what is an acceptable value for a field. Either way though you need to make sure you escape them when outputing HTML for webapps to prevent XSS. That combined with prepared statements when interacting with user inputs is the <i>only</i> right way to do things.<p>[2]: For basic CRUD operations and even simple one-to-many lists. Beyond that things can and do get hairy but those aren&#x27;t the majority of cases. The majority of app code is vanilla id-based select, inserts, updates, and deletes.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.jackdb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jackdb.com/</a>",1375223208

6130501,comment,6129148,6129148,11,0,artagnon,,,"The art of programming is evolving steadily; more powerful hardware becomes available, and compiler technology evolves.<p>Ofcourse there will be resistance to change, and new compilers don&#x27;t mature overnight. At the end of the day, it boils down to what can be parsed unambiguously, written down easily by human beings, and executed quickly. If you get off on reading research papers on dependent types and writing Agda programs to store in your attic, that&#x27;s your choice; the rest of us will be happily writing Linux in C99 and powering the world.<p>Programming has not fundamentally changed in any way. x86 is the clear winner as far as commodity hardware is concerned, and serious infrastructure is all written in C. There is a significant risk to adopting any new language; the syntax might look pretty, but you figure out that the compiler team consists of incompetent monkeys writing leaking garbage collectors. We are pushing the boundaries everyday:<p>- Linux has never been better: it continues improve steadily (oh, and at what pace!). New filesystems optimized for SSDs, real virtualization using KVM, an amazing scheduler, and a new system calls. All software is limited by how well the kernel can run it.<p>- We&#x27;re in the golden age of concurrency. Various runtimes are trying various techniques: erlang uses a message-passing actor hammer, async is a bit of an afterthought in C#, Node.js tries to get V8 to do it leveraging callbacks, Haskell pushes forward with a theoretically-sound STM, and new languages like Go implement it deep at the scheduler-level.<p>- For a vast majority of applications, it&#x27;s very clear that automatic memory management is a good trade-off. We&#x27;re look down upon hideous nonsense like the reference-counter in cpython, and strive to write concurrent moving GCs. While JRuby has the advantage of piggy-banking on a mature runtime, the MRI community is taking GC very seriously. V8 apparently has a very sophisticated GC as well, otherwise Javascript wouldn&#x27;t be performant.<p>- As far as typing is concerned, Ruby has definitely pushed the boundaries of dynamic programming. Javascript is another language with very loosely defined semantics, that many people are fond of. As far as typed languages go, there are only hideous languages like Java and C#. Go seems to have a nice flavor of type inference to it, but only time will tell if it&#x27;ll be a successful model. Types make for faster code, because your compiler has to spend that much less time inspecting your object: V8 does a lot of type inference behind the scenes too.<p>- As far as extensibility is concerned, it&#x27;s obvious that nothing can beat a syntax-less language (aka. Lisp). However, Lisps have historically suffered from a lack of typesystem and object system: CLOS is a disaster, and Typed Racket seems to be going nowhere. Clojure tries to bring some modern flavors into this paradigm (core.async et al), while piggy-banking on the JVM. Not sure where it&#x27;s going though.<p>- As far as object systems go, nothing beats Java&#x27;s factories. It&#x27;s a great way to fit together many shoddily-written components safely, and Dalvik does exactly that. You don&#x27;t need a package-manager, and applications have very little scope for misbehaving because of the suffocating typesystem. Sure, it might not be be pleasant to write Java code, but we really have no other way of fitting so many tiny pieces together. It&#x27;s used in enterprise for much the same reasons: it&#x27;s too expensive to discipline programmers to write good code, so just constrain them with a really tight object system/typesystem.<p>- As far as functional programming goes, it&#x27;s fair to say that all languages have incorporated some amount of it: Ruby differentiates between gsub and gsub! for instance. Being purely functional is a cute theoretical exercise, as the scarab beetle on the Real World Haskell book so aptly indicates.<p>- As far as manual memory management goes (when you need kernels and web browsers), there&#x27;s C and there&#x27;s C++. Rust introduces some interesting pointer semantics, but it doesn&#x27;t look like the project will last very long.<p>Well, that ends my rant: I&#x27;ve hopefully provided some food for thought.",1375223029

Sucks for the company, but if you&#x27;re not attractive to buyers or to the seller, then your market valuation was already wrong.<p>This would also curb the behavior of the large institution.

Sure, the south may have large swathes of intolerant rednecks, but considering that gay people regularly parade through some of our biggest cities in assless chaps (I assume. Its the cliche and its a funny point) I think we are already leaps and bounds ahead of Russia. We have a good handful of states that recognize gay marriage and the army decided to recognize and allow them. Any resistance to gay marriage is losing traction fast. Meanwhile, Russia just declared it illegal to spread &quot;Homosexual Propaganda&quot; which includes holding hands or kissing. Plus they practically hunt gay people for (very public) sport.",1375221768

If ISP A advertises guaranteed 1 Mbps for $50 and ISP B advertises up to 20 Mbps for $50 (in reality both are providing exactly the same service), then ISP A has no choice but to change their marketing if they want to stay in business. It&#x27;s the same thing we saw with &quot;4G&quot;; once Sprint started advertising 4 Mbps WiMax as &quot;4G&quot; then T-Mobile and AT&T had to call their 7 Mbps HSPA &quot;4G&quot; too.",1375221616

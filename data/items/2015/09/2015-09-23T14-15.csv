Just because the President is slick, keeps his cool, and doesn&#x27;t go off on &quot;vociferous diatribes&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s any less ideologically driven and dishonest.  One ideologically-driven liar is The President of the US, the other one is a no-name blogger that no one would know about if he wasn&#x27;t one of the very few voices to show up in opposition to the original narrative.

They try to twist the reality to convince <i>themselves</i>. The typical reaction when these kinds of arguments are brought on the Haskell community is &quot;space leaks are actually rare in the real world applications&quot;. Yes, this is the saying from the very community that emphasizes on program correctness. Sure, buffer overflow and memory leaks also rarely happen in other languages? Isn&#x27;t &quot;exact resource usage&quot; also a part of correctness? At least in a broader sense?<p>Even SPJ (one of the designers of the language) admits laziness should retire now (it was a good experiment to develop purely functional ways, but now the disadvantages outweigh the advantages), but most Haskellers will never agree with this because laziness does also have advantages, and they love it.

Once Angular 2 is ready though, I would only consider using it in a new project unless the company is already deeply invested in React (or other tech) & doesn&#x27;t have the time to migrate.<p>Angular 2 is still rough today, and that is why it is still in alpha - the Angular team is still trying to figure out what do they need to expose in the framework for consumers to build flexible components. In addition, the testing situation still needs to be refined some. The UI Bootstrap team is in the beginning of migration to Angular 2, and we already came across some pain points that Google is working with us to try to ease as much as possible.<p>As far as ng2 vs. React - ng2 uses pure HTML templates still. ng2 manages to use this and still optimize dramatically over React due to how change detection works in Angular. The template syntax is not complicated once you get used to it - it is much easier than remembering all of the edge cases that JSX has had to write around (i.e. className) due to issues of conflict with JS itself, and certainly much easier than remembering all of the little caveats and edge aspects of ng1.<p>Web component support for Shadow DOM is opt-in, and it does use the template tag for custom components. Observables have some overhead, but the great thing is that it is optional for many things, and easy to use when something is exposed as an observable.<p>The Angular 2 DI is much better than the Angular 1 version - it is much more powerful and doesn&#x27;t require a hacky implementation due to its use of decorators.",1443017772

The tax regulations e.g. in Sweden mean that it&#x27;s only viable to pick an environmentally friendly car, which is basically a CO2 emissions value. As an example the treshold in Sweden is 120g/km.<p>Almost every manufacturer have 2 liter disel models that (just) barely come in under 120g/km, including several VW models such as the Passat. So while a slight increase in fuel consumption might not be much, it could be a <i>huge</i> blow to european sales: if a Passat jumps just a tiny bit in consumptions, CO2 emissions are likely to stray above 120g/km meaning sales will effectively be cut in half (assuming half the buyers of new cars are those who need to get under 120g/km)<p>To illustrate how tight the margins are, the current model of Volvo V70 with the 2 liter &quot;D4&quot; diesel has offer a special 120g version with 16&quot; wheels in because the standard 17&quot; wheels would be an inch wider, and the resulting increase in drag makes the CO2 emission value 121g/km!",1443017544

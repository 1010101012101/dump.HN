It doesn't have to be material things either - these days it's mostly software and occasionally robots, and in the past it's been mathematics and music.  But I <i>must</i> create things - it's a fundamental part of the person I am.",1235941149

BDSM and roleplaying are considered weird and freaky by pretty much everybody.</i><p>Really?  I guess living in or near large cities all these years has warped my perspective of what ""in America"" means.  None of these things seems particularly weird or taboo amongst my social set.<p><i>If America had such an open nature to sex, we'd have fewer cultural problems than we do (and we have a lot).</i><p>And Japan doesn't have problems?  I think you're giving the culture a huge pass.  If you wanted to hold up the Netherlands as an example of a very healthy and very open sexual culture (including a societal understanding that teenagers have an interest in sex, and will have sex), then I'd be on board with you.  But, we're talking about Japan here...The land of ""Christmas cake"", ""kawaii"", etc.  Infantilization of women is the norm.  That's not healthy or merely open...that's just broken in a different direction than America's protestant zeal.<p>I wasn't trying to suggest that America has a healthy approach to sex.  We, on the whole, don't, particularly with regard to teenagers and sex (some of our child protection laws are bizarre and have horrific consequences, like labeling a 17 year old that has sex with a consenting 15 year old as a sexual predator and a child abuser).  But I said nothing about America in my comments.  This wasn't a ""Go USA!  Japan sucks!"" conversation, and I don't think there's really anything interesting about such a conversation.<p>Again, I'm not suggesting it should be illegal...just that I'm rather stunned that the market for a ""molest a child"" game is large enough such that that is how they market this product.  It is, to me, a disturbing indicator of the way a reasonably large segment of Japanese men feel about women (large enough to be the market they've chosen to target with this really clever new toy).",1235941115

Yes, you can do things for your soul, of for your friends, or for your family or for the society at large, but to be an entrepreneur means to accept to be judged, indeed, to judge yourself by your material success: money. It is not an easy thing to do. Money does not lie to you, does not tell you you're ok as you are now, that things will be better or that it will love you no matter what. Failure is clear to see, and so is success.<p>I probably needn't say it, but all this is worthless if you do not apply complete honesty to your work.

(I actually have memory of this happening - an editor of a major newspaper was a philander and another paper ran an article on him. Another big story happened 20 odd years ago - one paper was funded by the government and another newspaper brought that to light - the result was that one of the people who organised funding did not become president).<p>""And politicians don't always want to hide things.""<p>So, if they are not hiding something they would not mind people looking? I am one of those people who think it is a good idea of a healthy dose of cynicism for public officials.<p>""They chose to keep quiet and accept decades of hero-worship. The truth was that they were willing participants in a rather slimy and petty act of political revenge.""<p>The question is not if Woodward&Bernstein were upstanding citizens with good values.

499266,comment,499109,499183,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"There is some cleverness in there, and, I believe, some truth. Here is a quote that I liked:<p>""Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth--the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it.""<p>Besides, wealth is often demonized by egalitarians. They see its distribution as a random function of the universe, and not as a function of the productive efforts of the earners. For one person to have more money than another is considered unjust. We hear so much about how the wealthy are evil, it is nice for a different point of view to be aired every now and then.<p>>""The saddest thing I've ever heard was from a friend who told me that his main goal in life was making money""<p>It would not be so sad if he said that his goal was producing something of value, which often results in making money. As Ayn says, ""Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values"".<p>> ""Are people impressed by that article because of the sonorous prose?""<p>Yes, I do think the prose is quite nice. When Ayn hits a good stride, she reaches a style that is all her own. I think her talents are often under-appreciated because the literary establishment is very much opposed to her political views.",1235939538

499247,comment,499109,499177,0,0,neilk,,,"I got about 20 minutes into that ""Money as Debt"" video -- that's when he starts departing from, let's say, generally accepted theories of money. I don't have time to watch the whole thing, but I gather from other descriptions of the video that he advocates a policy of fiat money and repayment of debt via deliberate inflation, which is exactly the theory of the old Social Credit movement in Western Canada. That self-destructed.<p>He's correct that banks create money through loans. He's totally wrong when he says that money represents servitude.<p>He's ignoring that the purpose of debt is to create value, specifically to be able to do things today that make us all wealthier in the future. Yes, banks create money from nothing. That's because things of value - real wealth - are being created all the time, ""from nothing"", or at least, from nothing that is represented in the economy. They're mined out of the ground or grown from the sun, soil, and rain, or some complex permutation of all the above. Which is why we allow banks to grow the amount of money to represent it. When we take out a loan, we are saying something like ""I'm pretty sure I can mine some copper out of that hill. So give me some capital now because I need to get a shovel."" Rather than say money is debt you might as well say that money is certitude of present or future wealth.<p>By the way, this is the hidden truism of Paul Graham's mantra, ""make something people want"". Because ""something people want"" is another name for ""wealth"", and ""wealth"" is, under normal circumstances, easy to turn into money. So someone who says ""make something people want and you'll make money"" is expressing a near-tautology. (One that escapes most people, so it is good that he says it.)<p>I'm not totally in favor of our current systems, but that's another topic. And you have to know how the system works now to change it.",1235937959

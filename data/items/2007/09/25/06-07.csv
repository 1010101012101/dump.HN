59318,comment,59130,59130,0,0,dhpye,,,"Speaking as a developer who joined a project started by a guy who had a great idea for a <i>business</i>, the things I looked for was a really solid business plan, a good understanding of the problem domain, and a map that showed how we could get from here to there in 18 months. \nI might be more cynical than most, having gone through 3 dotcoms as a developer, but I'm also more optimistic than most (having earned less than 20k in the last year while we build this thing and I earn my pony, and the estate upon which to esconce it). <p>Don't sweat the code if that's not your strength: focus on your business plan. Most seasoned coders have seen umpteen \n'cool ideas' burn and die, and it's usually not technical issues from which Demise doth spawn. The one freakish happenstance of the current market is that, while most coders are not great risk takers, they are wonderful risk-smellers. <p>Some background: the progenitor of my current gig spent the last 3 years trying to build a business. He tried to outsource, and contract, and everybody told him it couldn't be done. We met through a mutual business acquaintance, and I fairly scoured his plans. 3 months later, we had a working prototype, and we launch in 4th quarter 2007. <p><p>",1190703505

They know how to sell the idea because they can make the case on the basis of deep knowledge. They are credible in the eyes of investors and so on.\n",1190702875

59312,comment,58915,58967,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"This seems silly.  The guy with the big idea should be handing out peanuts to the code monkeys, not giving them all of his cash.  Knowing exactly what the web system should do is far more important than a few programming skills (you can replace the code monkey more easily than you can a good startup idea).",1190700409

59310,comment,58025,58025,0,0,francoisp,,,"First, to Paul: I have really enjoyed a lot of your essays;\n most are very insightful and/or motivational, keep up the \ngood work. I have to ask, what's up with the word wrap? On \none hand the articles are formatted for a 80 lines terminal,\n and the comments do not render OK on my 1920*1280?<p>I have been reflecting along the same lines for a while, \nhere are few thoughts, if anyone is interested.<p>Philosophy is constructed from two words and could be \ntranslated literarily from Greek  as: love of knowledge. \nThis implies a ""lover"", and from this individuality in the \nact I see flowing a lot of the problems you describe.<p>From my understanding, Wittgenstein main point is: ""meaning \nis usage"". This is a generalization that is a centrality of \nphilosophy itself; Russell alludes to it in ""the problems \nwith philosophy"" as he sets the reader on a quest to right \nsomething that can't be.<p>Here's my reasoning: since no two person can use a word in \nexactly the same way, the inherent imprecision of language \nand of philosophy as a construction is a feature not a bug, \na v.useful one still; ever had this epiphany moment of \nhaving a great idea because you misunderstood someone? <p>If you set off to generalize enough on practical philosophy,\n I guess you get to the wisdom expressed in sayings and in \nillustrations; they convey by high bandwidth a particular \npattern of analysis from one individual to another one that \nseeks wisdom, but one would be hard pressed to call \nreceiving (as in ""idee recues"") sayings as a philosophical \nendeavor.<p>The way I now see philosophy is it's a quest to a personal \nworldview acquired through a personal love for knowledge.  \nIt cannot be exact nor absolutely true unless you're a \ndictator or a cult leader. This is why the idea and \n""ideators"" are so closely associated; people talk about \nA.Rand because through her constructed world view she gives \nan ethic that have seducing finalities; however as you point\n out, objectivism as she conceived it cannot be perceived \nagain by a human being let alone brought to new heights. <p>I find that reading inherently imprecise philosophical \nmaterial can give very strong insights exactly because of \nthe words are soft, and impact each unique individual in a \ndifferent way. The ones that are not purposefully unreadable\n that is (Foucault?), in this I agree with you. ""I"", as my \nexisting uniquely individual self, personally agree with \nyou; another unique entity that defines itself as an \nensemble of cells and electric currents. Seriously, I find \nit rather unconvincing that because you cannot pinpoint \nself, or soul, you negate something as evident as \nindividuality, from which ""I"" choses to defines itself. I \nguess this fits ""l'air du temps"", ref Dawkins, Pinker and \nco. It has the smell of groupthink tho.<p><pre><code> (BTW, evilmonkey your comment got me ROTFL)</code></pre>\nBest regards,\nFrancois Payette<p>",1190700272
59309,comment,58915,58915,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"Solution 1: Higher cost, shorter turn around time.  Spend the money to hire several programmers to implement your ideas for you.  However, keep in mind that you should become technically proficient enough to communicate with and monitor the programmers.  Otherwise, they're apt to take advantage of you.<p>Solution 2: Low cost.  Long turnaround time.  Start learning now how to program and build the web startup yourself.  The biggest drawback with this option is that there's more to learn to correctly build a web application than to build a more traditional desktop program.  It could take you six months before you've got a comfortable enough grasp of web programming to make progress on building your program.  Although if it can be built as a Facebook widget or on top of existing services like those offered by Amazon, that may cut down on overall development time.<p>Solution 3: Higher cost than #2 but much lower than #1.  Turnaround time would also be somewhere in the middle between #1 and #2.  Partner with a friend of yours who also knows how to program.  This way, if you decide to learn how to program you have someone right there to help you.  You also have the option of dividing the work where you handle the business side and let your partner(s) handle the technical end.",1190700184

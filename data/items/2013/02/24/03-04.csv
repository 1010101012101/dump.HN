Try using office on 950px width and you know what I mean - you simply can't get to lots of control elements comfortably without the full screen width. Mac software on the other hand has always been optimized for multiple non modal panels, still carried over in the prominent info window even in consumer apps. You can place that thing wherever you want. For power users this is very good because they can position these windows as close as possible to the content they want to edit, scroll the window behind without loosing focus (still not a standard windows feature) and do a series of operations minimizing mouse movement and clicks, since a panel of similar operations as their last one stays open. This as well as the always accessible main menu is what allows users to play around width the width of windows.<p><i>If only</i> window management and multi screen support were as good as the one on windows - it would pretty much be a perfect classic desktop environment.",1361676639

Fifty years of relative peace on a timeline of hundreds of thousands of years of near-constant oppression do not mean we have progressed beyond those baser instincts.<p>Guns are power; as such, the right to bear arms represents another form of the decentralization of power.

5272589,story,,,1,2,stickhandle,"Ask HN: MVP - minimum viable programmer",,"I get the occasional query from young programmers about what stack I think they should learn or focus on. Mostly, the answer is situational. But we can elevate the response to dogma ... maybe that would be fun. I have a bias towards full stack. I recognize a specialist path exists, but I think it should be the ambition of the few (and they will know when they are ""chosen). Even then, they would benefit greatly from the stack. Here's what I think everyone should add to their toolbox:<p>1. ""Almost doesn't need to be said"" category: html, shell (i.e. bash), uml, familiarity with <i>multiple</i> tools (editors, IDEs), some server knowledge.<p>2. A scripting language: In 2013, I guess the best candidates are Ruby and Python. In my book, Python gets the nod.<p>3. Web skills: And by web skills, I really mean competency in javascript and css. Understand naked js and css. You need to at least ""get"" jQuery. Digging deeper here? My vote goes to LESS for css and Angular for a js framework.<p>4. Java: I put Java in a category all by itself. This is the hammer in a programmer's toolbox. Understanding how to really design, write, and deploy Java applications is probably the single biggest step any programmer can take. Lots of people don't really like Java ... but they know it well enough to know why. It just informs so much in 2013. And if you work in the enterprise, its pervasive.<p>5. SQL: By sql I don't mean just crud statements. Know more. Much more. The db is behind everything. Knowing how to access it properly and efficiently will inform your ability to design db structures and your code (whatever language).<p>6 (Bonus) One more thing: Competency in the above makes you a useful corporate drone, a cog in the machine. We all want more than that. Pick one more thing: a framework (RoR, django, web2py, spring, play)? another language (scala, would be my pick)?<p>TLDR - Basics, Python, JS/CSS, Java, SQL, ? = future",1361675077

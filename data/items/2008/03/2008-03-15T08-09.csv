Your opinions and feedback(good/bad/ugly) very welcome.<p>You can login as demo/demo<p>And now to the questions,<p>1. Should I launch it in this situation. I ws hoping to launch it after I had some more features. But I am already 15 days late, than the deadline I set for myself.<p>Why I want to launch it now:<p>Of course I want real users so that I can not just be coding in vaccum, but solving real problems of real people.(TM)<p>Why I should wait:<p>Umm, I do not want to screw the launch. First impresiosn are last impressions.<p>2. How should I advertise this:<p>Options:<p>Social media:
 Umm, IMO, this is not a low involvement app, and would require substantial pre sell, before people would like to use this. Plus social media wont really be the people I am tragetting.<p>Adwords: 
The current bid prices for ""project management application"" is in the ballpark of 5$ per click! Even if I can get an awesome convert ratio of 10%, the cost to acquire a cutomer would be 50$. Ouch!<p>Advertising on blogs which target this market. Ok I think I will try this.<p>3. What should I charge for this, and when should I start charging.<p>When:<p>I want to offer this for free for sometime(say three months), after that I want to charge for serious usage. But I do not want to give away a lot of hings for free, coz once I bring on a paid plan, there would be backlash, unless there is substantial value add. Also once you set a price, in people's mind you set an implicit value for the product. So keeping this free for a long time does not seem wise.<p>How much:<p>Cant really think of an answer to this, before I can think of an answer to ""when"".<p>[PS. Sorry about the formatting. I can never get the post to display nicely on news.YC]",1205570817

I.e., PHP is arguably the most popular such language on the server and it's also the most insecure.",1205568666

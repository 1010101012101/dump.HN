8968480,comment,8963572,8965775,0,0,Animats,,,"No, not solved. Twilio can now <i>send</i> long SMS messages, but still cannot receive them properly.\nNow that everybody has smartphones, which do SMS split and reassembly invisibly to the user, the 160 character limitation is more of a historic thing and users are not aware of it.  In practice, most long SMS messages are outbound, because they&#x27;re marketing messages or spam, so this isn&#x27;t a problem for most Twilio users.<p>Technical details, for anyone interested:<p>Multipart SMS messages have a binary header which carries the sequence number info necessary for reassembly. The Twilio API for incoming SMS (<a href=""https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/twilio_request"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/twilio_request</a>) does not pass that through. The user&#x27;s application gets multiple message parts from Twilio (&quot;For incoming messages that are greater than 160 characters, the sending carrier will break up the message behind the scenes before delivering them to us, so Twilio will treat them as separate incoming messages and deliver them to your application in the order we receive them.&quot;) but without the info needed to put them back together properly.  So the customer&#x27;s program processes the first part right, and is then confused by the disconnected chunks of text in the later parts.<p>The Nexmo API (<a href=""https://docs.nexmo.com/index.php/sms-api/handle-inbound-message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.nexmo.com/index.php/sms-api/handle-inbound-mess...</a>) does: see the fields under &quot;Specific Parameters for long &#x27;concatenated&#x27; Inbound&quot;. The parts may come in any order, but they have ID numbers and &quot;part N of M&quot; info, so the user can reassemble them. Twilio support once talked about doing reassembly on their end, but that was never implemented.<p>Here&#x27;s Twilio support and a Salesforce user talking about this on Stack Overflow: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21025795/combining-a-multi-message-incoming-sms-message-from-twilio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21025795/combining-a-mult...</a>",1422561573

E.g. a common problem I saw when studying was papers that would describe processes, but omit any indications of sensible ranges for parameters that were essential to getting good results (I was working  on techniques for image processing to improve OCR results), or greatly obscure details of algorithms that would have taken no more lines to write out in working code.",1422561301

The key paragraph is attributed to Google&#x27;s lawyer.<p>However, the whole &quot;twitter didn&#x27;t get a gag order&quot; aspect does support the thesis that the Google gag order is to minimize criticism of the US lawyers.<p>Since the very same person (Jacob Appelbaum) appears to be the subject of both Twitter and Google search warrants, the &quot;we don&#x27;t want to alert TERRORISTS!&quot; excuse for the gag order doesn&#x27;t hold. Also, if it&#x27;s a search warrant, and not a CALEA-type on-going surveillance warrant, why would a gag order be imposed? If Google has the data, they have to turn it over or face penalties, and I&#x27;m sure they have a policy to fork over any legally-demanded data. They may have a duty to their own consciences to contest the search warrants, but I&#x27;m sure that they hand over data.<p>I can think of one other motive for such a gag order, and that&#x27;s to minimize the time that Appelbaum has to prepare a defense. That hardly seems fair, given that the USA is supposed to have a level playing field with ALL CITIZENS subject to the rule of law. I&#x27;d rather not think that the US Attorney, with all the legal and monetary resources of the federal government at hand, would stoop to cheap shots like that.<p>I think Gidari&#x27;s conclusion, although an opinion, fits the facts as we know them. The Google gag order was sought to contain or minimize criticism.

But by being able to have dialog from a mutual understanding of concerns you as well as your debater can likely reach a greater understanding of truth wherever it may lie.<p>Bottom line, if you can appear more knowledgeable of their perspective, they are more likely to listen to what you have to say.",1422559506

But then again most of the time you&#x27;re going to be filming in RAW so it doesn&#x27;t really matter as much since you get a flat image in post that you can grade.<p>An advantage the RED cameras have say over a Alexa is that they can film in 4k,5k,6k (Alexa only shoots in 2k). So that you can get a sharper image by editing in 6k, and then exporting in 4k or 1080p.<p>If you look at video cams for projects that need to be finished quickly, of course your not going to choose a RED. Canon Cinema Cameras (c100, c300) have the best colour science out of everyone (Sony and Panasonic are known to have pretty average colour reproduction). The only downfall with Canon cameras is that they use crappy codes and compression so when you start pushing to extreme looks, you&#x27;ll get alot of noise and loose sharpness in your footage.<p>I use Blackmagic cameras, which aren&#x27;t know for their colours either, but they own the industry standard grading software (DaVinci), so it is quite easy to get your footage balanced before you do a grade.",1422558607

8968169,comment,8966817,8968015,0,0,pash,,,"Insider trading was first outlawed in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The major motivation for the ban was to increase the public&#x27;s confidence that they could invest in financial securities without being taken to the cleaners by insiders who had a major informational advantage. [0]<p>Economic theory does lend some support for the idea that markets will perform better when the public is confident enough to participate in them broadly, and broad participation should drive valuations higher. (The latter is a dubious benefit.) But there is likewise plenty of theoretical justification for the harm done to markets by insider-trading laws. Markets are basically mechanisms for aggregating and analyzing information, and insider trading laws restrict the supply of basic facts. Mispricing ensues.<p>There are other justifications for banning insider trading, albeit all rationalizations post facto, as far as the legal history goes. Allowing a manager to trade her company&#x27;s shares (particularly to short them) can put her incentives out of step with those of the company&#x27;s other shareholders. But the managerial misbehavior that could provoke is already illegal under various other regimes. And the principal-agent problem is no argument at all for setting up a system like we have, one which bans trading by knowledgeable people who are in no position to influence corporate decisions.<p>But the economics are almost beside the point. The promise made by insider trading laws is that any Joe Schmoe can trade on the same footing as sophisticated professional investors, and that promise is a farce. It&#x27;s a farce not only because the incentives will always drive some people to break insider trading laws, but because ordinary people do not have ready access to all of the legally &quot;public&quot; facts anyway; many of them are locked up in obscure or expensive databases. And if Joe Schmoe did have all the public facts, he would still lack the other big piece of the informational puzzle, which is the ability to interpret the facts properly. That more than anything requires real expertise.<p>In my opinion, the public-confidence angle is the strongest component of the case for outlawing insider trading, but I think it&#x27;s a rather weak case in the end. The perverse truth is that if insider trading laws inspire the public to think they can play the markets on equal footing with sophisticated investors, then insider trading laws have succeeded in installing a false confidence; they have hoodwinked the public.<p>----<p>0. This has remained a main justification (at least rhetorically) for maintaining and strengthening insider trader laws over the past eight decades. For example, an act amending the rules in 1984 has this preamble: &quot;Insider trading threatens ... markets by undermining the public’s expectations of honest and fair securities markets where all participants play by the same rules.&quot;",1422558323

You could even do the tutorial idea but use iojs (<a href=""https://iojs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://iojs.org/</a>) to show how it differs etc.  People would like that and you would be learning something of value.<p>As for remote work, it is doable especially now.  Nice part about Javascript in general is even the diehard Microsoft shops will accept node more readily then they would say Rails or other tech stacks.  Honestly, it does and doesn&#x27;t make sense to me why that is but I have found it to be true overall.",1422558032

Having switched to a Mac in 2012, I found myself spending more time in OS X and Sublime Text, less time in Windows and Visual Studio.  I&#x27;ve started scratching the surface in other areas (Python/Django, Rails, Node), but I really just don&#x27;t enjoy them like I do the ASP.NET stack.<p>That being said, with the announcement of ASP.NET vNext and the open-sourcing of .NET Core, I&#x27;ve decided to double-down on the Microsoft stack (installing vNext, learning F#, writing more apps in ASP.NET, etc) since I&#x27;ll eventually be able to develop ASP.NET apps in OS X, with all of the tools I could ever want.",1422558021

And without the complexity of trying to infer information from the trades of others.<p>If all traders were equally informed (perhaps by a law that any information you wanted to trade on had to be public), there would be no way for people to profit by digging up new information. We (society) like it that analysts have a financial incentive to figure out the truth about how well a company is doing - whether that be by coming up with a better model of how one industry affects another (which will ultimately lead to better allocation of resources), or doing the legwork to realise that a particular company is a massive fraud (which leads in a more direct/obvious way to better allocation of resources).<p>But we don&#x27;t want them to just bribe insiders - that causes agent-principal problems, gives certain market participants unfair advantages, and all the rest of it. Hence the law, where figuring out these things through research is encouraged, but getting them from insiders is illegal.",1422558020

Right now its seems that the only valid conclusions is code that targets the GPU is better than code that targets the CPU  (for certain kinds of tasks).",1251788223
797552,comment,796382,796382,0,0,agent86,,,"In 2007 I was involved in a major automobile accident.  I fractured my neck at C6-C7 and completely shattered my right leg just above the ankle.  I broke both bones completely, resulting in having a rod and screws implanted in the bone.<p>It was 12 weeks with the neck brace on, and 14 weeks before I could walk unassisted with a cane.  Full healing and recovery took even longer then that.<p>The first thing you need to realize is that you don't have to hack your body - based on your tech details the doctors have already done that for you. Welcome to the bionic club!  The practice of medicine in general is akin to hacking - it either helps the body do something better, or coaxes it into doing something it wouldn't otherwise do.<p>Your diet should be as normal and healthy as it can be.  You don't need to do anything special.  If something was out of whack that you needed, it would probably be detected by now.  I was low on potassium and sodium after my emergency surgery and they wouldn't let me leave until it was corrected.  FYI - IV potassium burns :).<p>Your physical therapist can assist you with exercise.  In general they'll want you to do a variety of things in the office and give you some exercises for daily homework.  Do them!  Your therapist should be able to put together some appropriate exercises if you want to go beyond the basics.<p>The most important thing for you right now is to be extremely comfortable with your doctors and physical therapist.  You need to be able to tell them everything and anything without fear or embarrassment.  Sometimes the best test a doctor can do is to ask what you are feeling, and pushing through the pain in PT doesn't make you a hero.  Communicate, communicate, communicate.<p>Be careful with painkillers.  They are important, but they can be addictive.  It might not be a bad idea to have someone keep an eye on the bottle and make sure you stay within the prescribed limits.<p>I'm not sure what devices you could use to watch yourself heal, but you can probably get your X-Rays and other test images on CD when they are taken.  I've even got a bunch of physical X-Ray, CT and MRI films.<p>To help heal my leg, which broke in a spot at great risk for nonunion, they put me on an ultrasound bone healer.  Nifty little gadget - I still have it!<p><a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/25/portable-bone-healing-system-gets-fda-nod/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/25/portable-bone-healing-sys...</a>",1251788213

I started out working with the Xith3D library and made some contributions to it, but soon it became painfully clear that the best 3D library for Java was jMonkeyEngine, and it used lwjgl.<p>Looking further into it I think I found that JOGL seemed to be a somewhat abandoned project (sortof like Java3D), and that the real action was with LWJGL/jMonkeyEngine. Both had a far larger and more active community, and LWJGL supported more OpenGL features, and LWJGL may have been faster than JOGL too, although again, you're bringing up a fairly old memories, so I can't say they're perfectly accurate, I may in fact be spewing nonsense.<p>I'd say take a look at both and compare.",1251787066

The biggest differences between the two schools were not the teachers, facilities or funding. It was hands down the parents and students motivation and commitment to learning. Schools and teachers can only motivate their students so much. The parents and the students themselves must be the ones that drive the commitment and motivation to learn, regardless of the age of the child. When attending the ""bad"" school teachers devoted significant and resources to the minority of students that were motivated to learn because they were allowed to do so.<p>Now being a parent with Every Child Held Behind (ECHB), teachers can't afford to spend time with the motivated students to push them even higher. They must dedicate all their time to the kids and parents that have no commitment. My daughter has been in two elementary schools and both have treated her similarly; she can pass the test without help so she's a low priority student. I can't imagine where I would be without extra time spent by my teachers to push me further.<p>Both of my sister-in-laws are elementary teachers and both have considered leaving the field because of the constraints of ECHB. They can't teach the kids that want to learn, because they need to spend any time they have with ""Johnny"". When his parents actually bother to show up to a teacher conference, they accuse the teacher of not educating their kid. Ignore the fact that Johnny randomly shows up, is disruptive, is high on sugar and god only knows what else, and exhausted -- that’s not their fault. Johnny can't be moved to a special school or class, because that would hold him behind the rest of the class.<p>Does Johnny deserve to have access to education and assistance to address his issues - definitely. Does the rest of Johnny's class deserve to be held behind because of Johnny's issues, no they don't. Please can eliminate the failed policies of Every Child Held Behind.<p>PS - Any failings in my English are my own fault, not the teachers that I had as a kid.",1251785244

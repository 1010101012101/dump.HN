11646,comment,11551,11551,0,0,shsung,,,"We submitted way late - literally last minute - but we'll still be proceeding. It's okay, since we thought up of a few more interesting ideas, and a few that would be easier to start first before working on our really big ambitious one. It's amazing how many ideas you can come up when you really sit down and think about it. ",1176254631

11644,comment,11551,11551,0,0,rbc,,,"My business partner and I applied back in the spring of 2005 and were passed over.  It wasn't all that surprising to me, based on the number of applicants that the SFP had received.<p>In retrospect I'm a little relieved.  At the time, our company was not really in the state to make a run for a M&A or IPO exit, nor did it need to.  It was only after doing more research that I realized that our company mostly needed customers, not investors.<p>We've spent the last two years setting up the necessary infrastructure for us to support our customers.  It looks like 2007 may be our year.  It's been two years and we are still proceeding.",1176254059

Although not in the form and style of Apple's comeback, I think that IBM has ""reshaped"" itself in a very intelligent way, not reling anymore in ""monopolic"" strategies but being really competitive.
I do not know if M$ can do this morphing.

So, I am leaving Redmond to move on with my life and establish the startup in the San Francisco area. I have a GREAT idea that people WANT! I am mainly looking for like-minded people who are great hackers and are not afraid to embrace new technologies. SERIOUS ENTREPRENEURS please contact me at: theoutlander at gmail and we can discuss further...<p>On a side note, thanks PG for such a great opportunity!! Everyone that is selected has a lot work ahead of them ;-)....good luck to all!",1176253218

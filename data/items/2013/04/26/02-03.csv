There's the East/West coast factor to consider. East coast companies are much more likely to require/expect a suit and tie than a Silicon Valley company. At some East coast companies, even the janitors wear a suit and tie. I'm not making this up -- I've worked at several such companies where it was true.<p>> Do you know or have you been fired for choosing not to wear one?<p>It might be better to look at one's advancement prospects instead of fired/not fired. If you don't dress like you belong in an executive suite, chances are you won't be asked to occupy one.<p>> Any stories of employees firing their best employees or passing over a really great candidate because they refused to follow dress code?<p>This way of looking at it unfortunately suffers from self-reference. Someone who won't meet the dress code won't be looked on as a ""really great candidate"", so the exercise is undermined at the outset.<p>Suffice it to say that following the dress code is so basic and essential that no meaningful study that correlated dress and advancement could be done.",1366944551

5611186,comment,5608097,5611073,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"Those are <i>very</i> good questions: the fact is that there is a huge amount of tension between the judicial and legislative branches, and within the judicial branch itself, about there the boundary between jduges' interpretation and reaasonable interpolation of teh law, and the text of statute as written. Conservative jurists like Justice Antonin Scalia think you should always go by the text of the law, and that it's dead wrong to consider legislative intent, no matter how obvious or well-documented it is/was; this approach (known as textualism) holds that if a law is no good, the correct remedy is for Congress to rewrite it. Judges should only dismiss a law as unconstitutional or go around it in cases where there is a clear and unambigious conflict between the Constitution and the statute. Other jurists, such as Justice Stephen Breyer, look at the Constitution as more of a framework document and think that you absolutely need to examine laws within the context in which they were passed and in the light of which problem they're intended to solve.<p>This is a very gnarly question, with good arguments on both sides - but in addition, there's a lot of unstated political baggage tied to both sides of the argument, so that what is on the surface a question of legal philosophy is on closer examination rooted in quite different philosophies of governance.<p>Now myself, I like the common-law approach and I would prefer a general class of crimes and that the details of individual cases be taken up by wise jurists. On the other hand, it's not a foregone conclusion that all judges are wise or selfless, and of course there might be judges who are both but who would come to quite different conclusions from me because they operate on a different moral calculus. So for the sake of consistency and predictability, there's a strong argument to have laws debated and promulgated by legislators rather than judges, so that anyone can do and look them up for guidance about what is and is not legal. Of course that involves some idealistic assumptions about legislators...<p>If you like high-density reading material, I strongly recommend <i>How Judges Think</i> by Judge Richard Posner.",1366943604

5611161,comment,5609613,5609613,19,0,cletus,,,"Oh my God I'm sick of people equating IDEs (in the negative sense) with Eclipse. This goes beyond this post (eg typically emacs/vim users make judgments about IDEs based on having once used Eclipse). But take this statement:<p>> I especially find Maven unreliable in combination with eclipse.<p>Indeed. I have first hand experience with this. My team has a diehard Eclipse user who has added a bunch of random configuration plugins to Eclipse basically to make Eclipse work with Maven.<p>Compare this to IntelliJ. You can open a Maven project (even a multimodule Maven project) <i>directly</i> in IntelliJ. There is no project importing/conversion. It just works with the native Maven project model.<p>There are plenty of things to dislike about Maven but this isn't one of them.<p>The author is correct about Maven documentation generally being terrible. At one point I wanted to do something as simple as creating symlinks in the target directory instead of copying files. This would greatly ease doing Javascript development, for example.<p>Well there's a Junction plugin for Maven that alleges to do this. However it hasn't been updated since 2007 and relies on something no longer in a Maven repo that I could find.<p>But here's the point I most disagree with:<p>> Maven assumes there is one right way to build for everyone<p>A lot of people have this opinion (and prefer Ant, Gradle or something else as a result). I do not share this view. I like that Maven is opinionated about things like project structure.<p>Why? Because left to our own devices engineers are terrible at making these sorts of decisions. We all have a tendency to focus on some weird aesthetic and overstate its importance at the detriment of consistency across teams and projects.<p>I've had this argument with coworkers in relation to us having a very strict style guide for our code [1]. Opponents call this an obstacle getting in the way of getting something done and it has a cognitive cost of internalizing what is essentially useless information and arbitrary standards.<p>Obviously said people haven't worked in a large engineering organization where different teams would otherwise have different line lengths, curly brace styles, indenting levels and so on. It's a good thing there's a central set of conventions for this stuff. It avoids pointless ""wars"" about where curly braces should go.<p>I feel the same way about Maven's archetypes. Fact is, you can look at any Maven WAR project and know where to find pretty much everything. You can't say the same about any Ant project.<p>Just like with code style, people have an exaggerated view that their particular way of doing things is right and super-important.<p>Being consistent is often more important than being right.<p>Being right is subjective more often than it isn't.<p>In the end the author states:<p>> I think Maven works fine but in the past some logical choices have been made that do no longer make sense<p>which kinda makes and misses the point. He's right in that it does work fine for all its warts. But changing things like XML (for YAML or SBT's DSL or whatever) is pretty much a change for change's sake at this point.<p>Maven is one of many tools that isn't cool but is certainly good enough. There are really bigger things to worry about. How much time do you spend editing build files anyway?<p>[1]: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/</a>",1366942984

There are reasonable people on both sides...but, I question the intentions (and possibly the integrity) of people, particularly people in the tech industry, who support the bill as it stands today.<p>It shouldn't be surprising that so many people on HN are uncompromising on Internet freedom.

I've been like this off an on, without much rhyme or reason, since 2009 when I came down with mono for the second (yes second) time. I used to exercise every day, before I got sick. Now some days, if I do any kind of exercise -- for mere minutes! -- it'll knock me on my ass for days, a kind of exhaustion and pain and fatigue you can't understand unless you've experienced it. This they give the benign, cuddly title of ""post-exertional malaise.""<p>Luckily if somebody looks at me and thinks I'm fat because I'm lazy, I really couldn't give a shit, because having your vitality ripped from you at 26 really gives you perspective on stupid things like <i>that guy's staring at my fat ass</i>.<p>The irony, of course, is that you are guilty of what you claim others are guilty of not having a clue as to the private lives or struggles of the people around you.

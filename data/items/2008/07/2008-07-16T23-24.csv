248083,comment,247563,247852,0,0,pg,,,"Don't judge painters by art students.  They're quite different groups.  The link between art students and painters is nothing like the one between, say, medical students and doctors.  Most art students (painting majors especially) don't end up as artists, and quite a lot of artists spent little or no time in art school.  IIRC, Picasso went for one semester and Van Gogh didn't go to art school at all.  Calder studied engineering.",1216252635

On the point of cities, I think that there is good economic evidence (not cited by pg) that Cambridge and Boston are very much an intellectual center because some of the greatest universities of the world and they are leaders in terms of patents and scientific citations (from ""Who's Your City"" by Richard Florida).",1216250009

I'm an avid drawer and programmer.<p>I don't know how similar the mental processes of drawing and programming are.  But what I do know is that the state I'm in when I'm drawing feels the same as the state I'm in when I'm programming.  When I'm deep into either, I often remark to myself how relaxing it feels.<p>If painting didn't feel like programming to you, maybe it was because you weren't good at it.  When comparing hackers to painters, it only makes sense to compare people who are good at hacking to people who are good at painting.  Doing something you're not good at involves so many hurdles and complications that are unique to the novice that all you're getting is noise.  If you'd been drawing for as long as you've been able to hold a pencil, PG's thesis might not seem so bollocks.",1216249656

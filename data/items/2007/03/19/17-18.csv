Reddit sold for a reported 65 million (according to The Google), and they needed relatively little additional funding after the seed money. So let's say YC retained 3% of the company, they make 2 million which is a 100x return on their investment. Wow, I just did the math now...that's pretty impressive.<p>Update: A new search on The Google (link) suggests that the purchase price may have been much lower. Proponents of the ""50-million my ass"" school of thought are suggesting  5 million is closer to the mark. At 5 million, YC gets a 10x return on investment which is what all VC money is shooting for among successful (non-broke) companies.<p><a href=""http://reddit.com/user/bmatkin/"">http://reddit.com/user/bmatkin/</a><p>Larger point, if you're in it to win it you should be able to pull it off with or without YC. Sure YC connections and advice are tremendously valueable...but 5x to 20x better than the other smart VC/angel/seed money out there? No way!",1174327111

One of the many strange things you discover when you get rich is how dangerous it is to talk about it.  Most people don't mind, but occasionally one will go nuts on you in a way that is enough to make you not want to talk about the subject at all.",1174326392

This will also allow people, who lead boring lives, to live through others. Reality TV is a big hit because of this and it looks like justin.tv is a huge step forward towards even a more intimate experience. I have a feeling that in the near future, some people will live someone else's lives. Scary!\n",1174324856

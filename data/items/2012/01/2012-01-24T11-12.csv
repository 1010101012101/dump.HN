Its to show that you've learned the material. He goes on to say:<p>>  Presumably the idea is that if you can't get through a course in the 12-to-13 week semester then you deserve to fail, regardless of whatever is going on in your life and whether you could have learned everything over a longer time span, or with more help, or whatever.<p>12-13 weeks is plenty long to learn the material for a course. A student is at a college to learn. It should be their top priority to learn the material during the course.<p>As for ""failure #3"", lectures have been used for hundreds of years because they work. You gain insight from someone very knowledgeable in a field that you might not get at first without it being pointed out to you.<p>He also seems to miss the fact that for science courses, you need labs. You cannot do chemistry labs online. You won't be able to do field work in biology by watching a video.<p>A somewhat agree with point #1, but more so to the fact about how expensive college is. That needs to be changed.<p>You lose the overall <i>atmosphere</i> of a learning environment through online courses, and that is not something I'd want to give up.",1327406343

3504345,comment,3504203,3504203,5,0,jiggy2011,,,"Interesting piece.<p>A few points.<p>Firstly I entirely agree that having access to a video of a lecture is much better in many ways than attending live. I have a terrible attention span and I remember sitting in classes paying attention then having my mind slowly drift away for just a few seconds, by the time I'd snapped by I'd sometimes completely lose the context of the example the professor was explaining and it was really hard to mentally catch up, sometimes I couldn't and I'd just end up with a set of half comprehensible notes to revise from.<p>Of course your not going to raise your hand and say ""sorry I wasn't paying attention could you please repeat"", but a video does not judge you like that. Pause it or rewind and get yourself a coffee , look up something you didn't quite understand on wikipedia for an alternative explanation then return to the video.<p>Of course there is no reason for lectures to be an hour long either, simply break it into 2 half house sessions with space for questions in between which could be done via a chatroom which the lecturer answers when they return.<p>I'm sure I would have got much better grades at university had I had access to all of the lectures via video, whenever I want to brush up any CS I just watch youtube videos from MIT , Berkeley etc and I learn so much more per hour than I did from my ""traditional"" education.<p>Another point.<p>This part raised a question to me:<p>""Presumably the idea is that if you can't get through a course in the 12-to-13 week semester then you deserve to fail, regardless of whatever is going on in your life and whether you could have learned everything over a longer time span, or with more help, or whatever. ""<p>How much of your university degree is there to prove what you know and how much is there to prove your capacity for learning?<p>I've often struggled with some concepts that others have found easy and sometimes vice versa, but I can get a bloodymindedness that I <i>will</i> get to grips with something even if it takes me 10x the time.<p>How much should learning speed be represented vs sheer determination? Sometimes in the real world you will run into situations where you need to learn something very quickly because there simply isn't the time.<p>Should someone who takes 5 years to get a degree be considered lesser than someone else who does the same degree in 2?

Because he is good at finding what is really important to people and how to get things done. If he wants something from you, he will also give you solutions to some of the harder problems you have in exchange. So I don't think a strong bargainer is a dick.<p>Of course there are people who bargain to trick you. And even normally fair and strong bargainers will sometimes use their powers more to their advantages then they should. But in my eyes it's not the common situation. Between sticking-to-the-first-number and tricking-each-other-out-of-money there is a big range of good and bad bargaining which actually solves the good purpose of finding each others priorities, a good range for the value bargained, and a result both parties can agree to.",1327405741

Interactivity and textbooks are what they decided on.<p>Ed Bott thinks Apple should just sell the same textbook as Amazon plus a widget.  Apple probably thought about that but realized the plus a widget version would cost extra and people/school districts would buy the cheaper version from Amazon or whoever.<p>So they went the exclusive route. Here's out format, here's the tools that make it easy, and here's the catch:  sell on our store only.  It's that simple.

Before Mario published his book, he wrote a German tutorial on game development (which, same as the book, is great), that's where I have the code base from. I mentioned Mario in the app as well as in the Android Market description as well as on my blog and our website and left the game licensed under the GPL of course. There's not much more referencing I can do. I also once took the game off of the Android Market, but Mario told me to put it back on.
Regarding the ads: The other ad network I use is madvertise. T me it's interesting that they appear to be more intrusive to you, since their banners actually are a lot smaller than those by AdMob. How come? I also use Heyzap which I also find a bit annoying, especially on small devices, which will be removed with the next update.<p>Personally, I really like quality apps and think on the long term, even if they are not financially successful, the gain is bigger with these apps than with apps that provide lower quality. However, also prank apps can be of good quality of course and in the end it's the user who is judging. There had been more or less successful fake iPhone apps on the Android Market almost since day one, but most of them don't exist anymore. That's also why I thought David's app would be removed fast, especially when the audience became bigger. This didn't happen so far, which surprises me a little. For David, I hope nothing like a lawsuit or removal will happen, but the possibility obviously will always exist.",1327404006

I'd usually effectively lose one day to travel each way + one day after I returned where I'd be totally useless.<p>In terms of the work, it was challenging to work remotely. We spent a lot of time on Skype, but the time difference wrecked havoc on my schedule - my coworkers in the valley got in around 5pm-6pm London time, and would usually still be in the office at midnight my time, so I ended up working in the evenings a lot, often while also working a lot during the day. If it hadn't been a startup I might've tried to keep more strictly fixed working hours with evenings some days (to account for meetings etc) and more free time during the day, but that wasn't really an option.<p>I managed a team, which was even trickier because whenever I flew out I'd spend 2-3 days resolving whatever drama had arisen since my last trip. My impression both from that job and others where I dealt with SV engineers is that you're far more likely to find some real primadonnas with huge egos amongst software engineers in SV than in most places in Europe. Most of the guys I worked with were really nice, though, and overall it was a great experience.<p>Trickiest part with the regular visits: Make sure to never, ever say the wrong thing to immigration. If traveling under the visa waiver program, you're not allowed to do normal work while in the US. You can receive instruction and participate in meetings etc., but you can't do ""productive work"". We had an immigration lawyer instruct me in detail on what I was and was not allowed to do and how to address this with immigrations to mitigate the risk that I might get turned away. This was because I was flying in often enough to get asked extra questions now and again, though - if you fly in a couple of times a year, there's not much scrutiny, but I had about 13-14 stamps from SFO in my passport and none from other locations at one point...",1327403810

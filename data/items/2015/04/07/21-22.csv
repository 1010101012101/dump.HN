My wife&#x27;s friend recently had a baby, and she exploited the situation to the full. She didn&#x27;t come to work for almost 7 months using various excuses, and she was openly telling her friends at work about how she was exploiting the situation. I don&#x27;t know how much management knew about it, but they didn&#x27;t fire her because they were afraid of getting sued. Management isn&#x27;t always bad by definition!<p>I am obviously not saying that everyone exploits maternity. I&#x27;m just highlighting that there can be another side to the story. Isn&#x27;t it possible that the management was already considering letting the Director of Engineering (a role that by definition is not going to have a lot of peers) go? What do they do if she&#x27;s pregnant at the same time? Wait for 6 months just so they don&#x27;t get sued?<p>EDIT: Can&#x27;t respond in a reply, so I am responding here. &quot;Exploiting a situation&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean utilizing benefits legally given to you. An example of exploiting the situation will be: My employer is required to give me paid sick leave. So, even if I&#x27;m not sick, I&#x27;ll claim that I am and get paid for taking time off. And usually, it&#x27;s not the employer who gets hurt by something short-term like this. It&#x27;s my peers who have to pick up the slack.",1428443962

I originally thought I was having a heart-attack but being a healthy 25y/o man that was ruled out pretty fast. After a few days in the hospital they had absolutely no conclusive cause for my condition. I&#x27;ve been suffering a major amount of stress lately which lead to this condition. They gave me a paper on stress cardiomyopathy and it makes complete sense to me as two weeks earlier I was having panic episodes due to stress and I knew that I would give myself heart problems if I continued. Freaky stuff how powerful the mind is.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to say but I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking. It all boils down to some core problems. Negative thinking: focusing on bad things that could happen, lack of confidence, trust issues with people.<p>However I&#x27;ve now realized something: part of this way of thinking is fundamental to how I work. The most crucial part of my job as a SysAdmin/Engineer is finding problems and solving them and finding ways to improve existing systems. It&#x27;s completely in my nature to find problems and then solve them (I&#x27;m self taught). However I think lately I&#x27;ve been focusing on so many problems that it&#x27;s gone out of control. I realize this now as I analyze photos on Flickr (photography is a hobby of mine). I look for the problems in the photo, look for room for improvement, then leave without gratification on to the next one. Seeing this pattern outside of work has triggered a red-flag.<p>What I&#x27;m asking is how do more experienced and like-minded people handle this?

I also get that you think that the issue is a matter of foundation - since fewer women/minorities are learning to be software developers, fewer of them apply. You&#x27;re just at the end of the assembly line, not the cause of the problem.<p>The issue is that while misogyny and racism are no longer institutionally enforced, they are far from dead. There&#x27;s still deep seeded biases and cultural attitudes that are constantly oppressing women and minorities from succeeding (we can certainly argue how big or small an impact this may be, but it is very certainly there without a doubt). Trying to address the foundation (i.e. schooling of children and their upbringing) is a start, it&#x27;s just not enough. There needs to be a decelerating force applied at all levels of society to counter act decades of inertia working against women and minorities.<p>Further, my own personal belief is that &#x27;best for the job&#x27; is a loose term, especially in the tech industry. Maybe for something like a fireman that has strict and narrow requirements it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;you need to be the best&quot; through physical endurance tests, but for something as wide as computer software, best can also be people who are more organized, more loyal to the company, and especially more diverse (in terms of creative power).

Adding this liability just compounds the current issues where felons are nearly incapable of becoming employed after serving their sentence. If the state determines that a person is safe enough to the general public to be released from prison, why should an employer be expected to investigate beyond that? On the flip side, if a person is a significant threat, the state should be liable for letting them out of prison, not the employer who hired them.",1428440432

If you have break on exception enabled, and you make an error inside getValue, it now pauses on the throw in the above code instead of inside getValue where you actually made the mistake.<p>This is true, although for errors thrown explicitly with throw your debugger will stop at the actual throw site.<p>The good thing is the original exception&#x27;s stack is maintained, so you know when it came from and can set a bp next time.<p>>It&#x27;s cool, I just don&#x27;t understand why everyone is so excited about a simple syntactic improvement.<p>The excitement is related to the comparative ES5 code (state machine) that would be needed to achieve it, not the ES6 code (generators).

Most people (vast majority) learned OOP in a classical style, so that's what they're going to be comfortable with and will try to implement. It doesn't automatically mean classical style is superior.<p>2. You may want to check out the Klass library[1]. It provides a <i>""classical interface to prototypal inheritance.""</i> So perhaps classical style is easier to use, but prototypal is better to have in the background.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/ded/klass"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ded/klass</a>",1329429568

(also great)<p>No. Dart has classical inheritance, which by the large number of classical inheritance libraries for Javascript, is still very popular even when prototypal inheritance is available.<p>I personally abhor prototypal inheritance. It's aesthetically unappealing, hard to reason about, hard to optimise, and turns what is usually a declarative pattern into an imperative one. When most people are approximating classical inheritance anyway, that's a big sign.<p>It's sometimes nice that objects can differ structurally from their class, but I've never found it that useful.",1329429071

We put a lot of work in our startup proxxler.com during the last two years. With Proxxler we want to give non-programmers a platform for app creation without learning a programming language or installing SDKs. Our builder allows you to use ready-built components as well as to implement some logic in a visual script editor. Currently, you can create Android apps (and install them directly to your device) as well as Flash apps for your Facebook stream.<p>We even hope, this can be helpful for teaching kids and high schoolers basic programming skills. Not too geeky and with a direct result that can be shared with friends.<p>Thanks HN!\nMarco<p>http://www.proxxler.com<p>PS: We still have some accounts for our alpha test left. For the first 50 HN users mailing us (contact [@] proxxler.com, use 'HackerNews' in subject) we will give direct access to the service. Additionally, you can register on the site for beta testing, which will start in a couple of months.",1329427628

Most people get depressed from time to time, but others have physical and mental problems that lead to very severe depression, manic depression. These people can't just fix their problems and get better like normal people when we get depressed, because their depression doesn't stem from their problems.  That's not to say that their problems can't compound the depression, my sister is bipolar and gets REALLY depressed sometimes, and certainly some of that is her situation, but a lot of it is also hereditary mental illness she got from my mother.

3600693,comment,3599342,3599891,2,0,mjb,,,"One issue of concern is the possible cost of these false positives. If doctors are very careful to communicate to patients that 75% of positive results will only require a second test, then that's OK. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be what happens in many cases. The communication given to the patient is 'this is a test for disease X', and the patient rightfully interprets a positive result as 'I have X'.<p>The problem comes in because 'I have depression' could lead the patient to take risky or dangerous action. Sadly, misunderstanding on the side of doctors (who, at least the ones I know well, aren't given a strong education in statistics at university) might also lead them to make poor decisions. As long as everybody is honest about the meaning of the test, and understands the differences between P(Y), P(X), P(Y|X) and P(X|Y) then that's great. Sadly, there is good evidence that this is not always the case.<p>For an example more along HN's normal lines, consider hard drive monitoring data from SMART. Several public studies of SMART attributes in modern drives have shown that positive predictive value of SMART data as a drive failure indicator is very poor. Many of the drives which are replaced because they are failing SMART are actually just fine, but a lot of money, labor and downtime is spent on the incorrect assumption that P(healthy|SMART failure) is much smaller than P(unhealthy|SMART failure).",1329427340

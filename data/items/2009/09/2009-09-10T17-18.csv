The advantage of XML is that it's a well-specified and reasonably flexible way of representing structured data.  You can interpret an XML document as code (e.g., XSLT) but basically XML is just data until you say otherwise.  Configuration file formats should be dumb.  You shouldn't be able to program your configuration file to play chess.  The only significant downside of XML is its verbose and barely readable syntax, and you don't need a configuration file that has its own byte compiler and runtime system to provide readable syntax.",1252605553

I think the other big drawback is that you can write markup and a rendering engine or whatever consumer of that markup can attempt to optimize the interface creation, maybe its faster to instantiate 100 table cells and then make the rows and then the table, if this code is editable you could inadvertently mess up your code.<p>Either way it seems like a lot of work for no gain, you end up with a big pile of interface and if its markup or code or whatever, if its written by a tool its going to be no fun to manually work with.",1252605426
815778,comment,814344,815103,0,0,nuweborder,,,"Exactly.  Thanks for proving my point.  Clearly the playing field is not level.  The only reason that ""Grizzly Bear"" is not as popular as Maroon 5, is because they dont have the outlet (iTunes or anybody else) in which to present themselves and compete.  Maroon 5 is not the hottest thing since sliced bread.  Trust me.  There are many unsigned artists out there that are just as good and better, and that people would search for and request, and buy songs from, if they had the opportunity.  An opportunity that is spawned from the people, music lovers themselves, and not major labels and the FCC.<p>That's great that ""once"" a month Apple releases a new indie pack.  As if that truly compares to the amount of heavy rotation that major artists receive on iTunes.  Not.  Sorry to tell you, but that indie pack with 20 new bands once per month, is not getting anybody any significant exposure, nor helping any unsigned musicians to really earn a living from their music.  Especially not in comparison to the millions Maroon 5 and others are getting.<p>Lets take notes from YouTube and Digg.",1252605410

815776,comment,815652,815652,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Rant on mp3 blogs and free streaming music...<p>What's funny is when projectplaylist.com was actually accessible, it was basically an HTTP version of Napster for music blogs. They made it seem like they were playing MP3s found on other sites, but they really aggregate all of the files in a large storage cache sorted by seemingly-random numbers. They then obfuscate the URLs by ""encrypting"" them with a single RC4 key which was embedded in their flash player. The end result was a search engine for finding and downloading any music you could possibly want right from their high-speed repository.<p>I don't think they ever re-implemented this but they did change the HTTP interface every so often, and now the main pages are down most of the time. Myspace had a similar functionality (with XML to serve the location of the files, so no nasty html grepping needed) but when they released their music-centric site they finally got wise and added a more dynamic system of authorizing and re-authorizing each piece of music being played while it's playing. This actually is neat because it allows you to gather stats on which songs are being played for how long and who's really interested. It wasn't worth it to me to extend my script to support this more complicated functionality but I don't see why it couldn't be reverse engineered with a little time.<p>So anyway, any of these streaming music sites are basically playing a dangerous game with their content. When you hand someone content for free, anonymously and via the internet, you're just asking for someone to make a script to download it where they don't need to watch your ads. RTMPE is not a solution because we've had rtmpe reverse engineered for what seems like years now. It seems like the only thing that makes content providers interested in this at all is when someone makes a snazzy GUI which does all the work for you and simply downloads songs.<p>All this could be handled by simply requiring authentication & authorizing song plays N at a time. Then you don't really need copy protection since the user simply doesn't have the capacity to download more than one or two songs at a time, which (if implemented correctly) can make it damn hard for anyone to exploit your service.",1252605379

815727,comment,814632,815138,0,0,dreish,,,"This is confusing the difference between concurrency and parallelism, the latter of which Clojure doesn't <i>yet</i> address.<p>If your program is divided into threads, having a language like Clojure that makes concurrency easy and lock-free is a wonderful thing, and of course you get some benefit from running on multiple cores, though I don't think that's entirely the point.<p>If, on the other hand, you're looking for a faster way to map a function across eight million lines in a flat file, using Clojure's map function won't magically make your program run faster (and pmap might not run at all -- you may run out of memory, since pmap isn't truly lazy).<p>The fact that a Clojure PersistentVector (not a PersistentList) is implemented with a 32-way tree (not 64-way) does not imply that Clojure has abandoned the car/cdr paradigm in favor of conc lists -- it still uses cons, in a more generic form, but still with the same first/rest concept.  The trees allow vectors to be inexpensively persistent, so you can have actual practical immutable vectors.",1252604218

They chose one vendor and tied them up in a contract to say that the software would meet the RFP.<p>Then the project starts, and the company notices that the software doesn't really meet the RFP, so they get the vendor/consultancy to customize it. Otherwise they wouldn't be getting their contract's worth, you know. The earlier claims of not changing the software get thrown out the window. Plus you have the business people who have been seconded to the project, they don't want to tell their colleagues they are delivering a clunkier system than the old one so they fight for the customizations. Fair enough.<p>IMO, any software that is absolutely critical to your company's special way of doing business (i.e. your competitive advantage) you shouldn't customize an ERP product to do it - you should build it yourself. Anything that is generic and not a point of difference between you and your competitors, you should keep as standard as possible. The bit where they join up, make sure you abstract it properly.<p>As soon as you create barriers for upgrading your ERP, you lose the value of the maintenance (which is the ERP vendor's developers working hard to add new platform and application features, instead of your guys).",1252603977

And that far from being insulated from this, programmers will have to be thinking about it throughout.<p>It's possible that Clojure's implementation is already such that these primitives, and a programming style built on them, are feasible today. If so, that's awesome. But this is a different thing than providing better implementations of cons-based abstractions.<p>Edit: another thing - the transformation from cons to conc is nontrivial in the Lisp context because Lisp's code=data is so tied to cons. It might be an interesting to think about what programs would look like if you applied code=data rigorously in a conc model. Would a language whose expressions are represented as concs look or feel significantly different than a cons-based one?",1252603700

I don't think it's desperation which helps as much as it is taking risks or doing <i>something</i> to change your situation, but one doesn't need to be desperate for that. As far as the success of Richard Branson's ventures it reminds me of Donald Trump saying he always found it easier to raise money for larger more ambitious projects than smaller ones, so there may again be some correlation favoring higher risk taking - at least if you have nothing really to lose.

A lonely startup might be able to build a better product, but the hard part is getting a company to stake their future on it[1].  Companies shopping for ERPs value stability of the company as much as quality of the product.  The last thing a company wants is to install an ERP from a company that may go out of business in 5-10yrs.<p>It was said in the article, but I will reiterate: enterprise software companies are mostly made up of salesmen-not software engineers.  The majority of their profit margin is from after-sale products such as warranties and consulting.  These products have very little to do with the quality of the software product itself.  In fact, it might even pay for the software to be buggy since a) more bugs = more consulting = more renewed warranties b) multi-year software contracts are not unheard of and c) ERP switches are extremely costly so companies stick with them for years, if not decades.<p>As a programmer, I wish that a quality ERP product could stand on its own, but sales and (company) size are key if you want to compete with SAP/ORACLE/MS.  At the very least companies will ask for previous customer references, run a D&B on your company, and ask for a proof of concept install.  This is a space so ripe with opportunity it hurts but for a small startup to succeed, it will need to pick off pieces of the giants before competing with the entire product.<p>[1] Yes, ERP software and implementation is that big of a deal.

I'm all for making it easier to allow talented people entry into the US, but I hate the idea of empowering investors to grant green cards.  I think Paul Graham is an inspired investor and a smart guy, but should he be allowed to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't?  Should a panel of credible lawyers, VC's, and entrepreneurs be allowed to do this?<p>I think that an employer should be able to offer a <i>job</i>, not US residency.  I think an investor should be able to offer <i>money</i> (and advice, guidance, support).  But not a green card, no way.<p>Think of the implications here.  A young investor really doesn't need the money.  He's ramen profitable.  But he needs the investor's permission to be a startup <i>in the us</i>!  Well, that's one way for VC's to get the upper hand in an era when their money doesn't matter as much.<p>Look, I know hacker news folks tend toward the libertarian side and are generally skeptical of government.  But I want the people who decide to award green cards to report to the voting public, not to Larry Ellison.  I admire PG, but he doesn't answer to me as a member of the voting public, and he shouldn't.  Once VCs gain control over the immigration system, they assume a government role, but we can't exactly vote them out of office if we don't like their decisions.

Personally, I'm not all that interested in trying out a regime of VCs, no matter how credible a panel has found them to be.<p>As for the ""Green cards to all CS majors"" idea, I think a very narrow rule targeting CS would discourage US students from this field, and encourage them instead to pursue more protected degree paths like law.

He then went on a spending spree (trying to build new, ultimately unsuccessful companies) that very nearly bankrupted him.<p>With his savings dwindling and the looming prospect of having to go back to work for someone else, he locked himself in the basement (so to speak) and, in a last-ditch effort, built a profitable company in a few months time. AND, here's the part that gets me, he made this product successful, nearly single-handedly in a market that was already crowded with competitors.<p>He tells me now that its harder for him to have success in business (5 failed in the last 2 years), primarily because there is no real sense of urgency to drive him to succeed anymore, what with the checks still rolling in. This is despite the fact that he is amazingly talented, both in software development and in business development.<p>Since meeting him and learning his story, I have been looking for ways to make myself as determined/desperate as he was when he built his company.",1252602817

The BOM is a hierarchical database that breaks it down into major components, then each of their components, and so on all the way down to individual nuts and bolts. These all need to be assembled in a particular order, they come from different vendors, they have different lead times, and so on. Classic ERP is about saying, OK, if we want to fit the wings on this date, we will need to have ordered the bolts by that date from this supplier, or if the wndscreen is a day late, how will that affect the rest of the work on the cockpit.

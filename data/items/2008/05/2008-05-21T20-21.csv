196536,comment,196025,196410,0,0,xirium,,,"The economics of downtime is a very important consideration. I read that three minutes of downtime reduces the value of a website by 1%. However, that may be a figure bandied by vendors of high-availability equipment. It is also generally acknowledged that high-availability is achieved through strict processes and sheer redundancy of hardware. Therefore, it gets exponentially more expensive to minimise downtime.<p>So, you've got two non-linear curves, cost and benefit. If you've got an exceptional team, a great architecture and good finances then getting 99.999% uptime should be easy. Of course, this assumes that you don't have unforeseen circumstances, glaring omissions in redundancy - or exponential growth and utilisation without a revenue stream.<p>Even with generous financing, exponential growth can be deadly. A small but sustained increment in load can be enough to cause a backlog in requests that never recovers. If you're growing fast then it can occur anywhere in your system at any time. I've been a DBA for a renderfarm with thousands of cores and this situation is stressing.<p>We've also had this situation while working on search. Thankfully, it occurred on a smaller scale and most thankfully it occurred before launch. We had two database servers, two app servers, no redundancy, on unreliable hardware. We didn't make much headway with efficiency improvements because long tests were likely to encounter hardware failure. It was demoralising.<p>This slowed the development and testing of a database failover feature in the database wrapper. Now this has been implemented, progress is much better. A test that previously took three hours now takes five minutes and we've had much more time to migrate to reliable hardware and introduce redundancy. We've also got a setup which can be used to test resilience to real modes of failure.",1211402640
196534,comment,196241,196393,0,0,neilc,,,"<p><pre><code>   The speed which the code can be understood says much more about the writer than the reader.
</code></pre>
I think the point is that you hold the writer of the code invariant, and then substitute different code readers; the rates at which two different people can understand a given piece of code says something about their ability as programmers. More than just rate of understanding, I think depth of understanding is just as important: a novice might read some code and say ""it does X"", whereas an expert will understand X, observe that the code really meant to do Y, and that it might have memory leaks, deadlocks, or incorrect corner cases, for example.<p>I think Gates has a very valid point: there are <i>lots</i> of circumstances where you need the ability to wade into an unknown code base and understand how it behaves (and how it <i>ought</i> to behave). The ability to read through code and understand <i>non-trivial</i> properties of the code really takes some experience to develop -- that is directly relevant to code review, for example.",1211402557
196533,comment,196370,196503,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"That is incorrect. It is very hard to use simple rules like that to get high returns, because when enough people follow the rules, they become invalid. Renaissance is using a huge number of strategies, and they're constantly testing them. It's likely that any given strategy will be obsolete soon enough, but less likely that they'll all be wrong at once.<p>It might be useful to think of Renaissance as a market-maker, not a money manager -- given that you described two buy-and-hold strategies, and their average holding period is six minutes, it sounds like they might not be in the business you're talking about.<p>It's possible to get superior returns over time by having such a low cost or such a strong brand that your product is qualitatively different from someone else's: having a brand like Coca-Cola that is, say, 5% more recognizable than Pepsi can give you something that's worth much much more than Pepsi + 5%; being able to make trades 1% faster and 1% cheaper than anyone else (if Rentec can do that) means having a monopoly on taking advantage of one set of market discrepancies.

In a relatively small city with narrow streets like Cambridge, buses have just as many problems navigating around cyclists, awkward intersections, and indeed other buses. And the problems buses <i>cause</i>, particularly when only sparsely occupied, have nothing to do with cars at all.<p>> Why not build new roads solely for the use of buses?<p>Where are we going to put those?<p>They're trying to create new roads only for the use of buses, by taking away lanes that used to be for everyone and designating them to be bus lanes instead. That is making things much worse for everyone else, because it means 50% of the road surface on major arterial routes is unused most of the time. And it isn't even helping buses that much, because they still have to get to and from those major routes on the back roads they serve, and they still have to stop at lights or give way at roundabouts just like everyone else.<p>(Cambridge also has far too many sets of traffic lights for its size, which introduces an entirely artificial ceiling on the capacity of its road network for reasons no-one seems to quite understand. You can usually tell when the lights fail at a major intersection, because the drivers all start being polite and taking turns to proceed, there are hardly any queues in the area, and journeys are invariably quicker and more pleasant. Note to people wanting saner traffic systems for cities in future: competitive routes and stop/go lights are an evil that will cripple your efficiency.)",1327606596

We've changed our idea, made mistakes, and failed repeatedly. Yet in all that time, pg and co have had and continue to have our backs 100%.<p>- One thing I've learned in life is that who you choose to surround yourself with matters immensely. Doing YC means surrounding yourself with great people.<p>- Every single YC partner is a genuinely lovely person. The other week we got a heartwarming and encouraging email from Kate, YC's <i>architect</i>.<p>- The YC network is unparalleled. In the past week, I've relied on it half a dozen times.<p>- I don't know how to put this, but YC has <i>taste</i>. Where others are political or indirect or care about appearances or do things without thinking about them, pg and co are the opposite: Direct, thoughtful, and <i>good</i>. YC is good in much the same ways pg's essays are good, if that makes any sense.<p>I cannot recommend YC highly enough.<p>(Sorry if that was too effusive.)",1327604850

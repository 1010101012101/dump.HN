202232,comment,201844,201844,0,0,fdschoeneman,,,"A couple of short pieces of advice.  This is a tactical sales problem, not one of strategy or positioning.  It sounds like your strategy is just fine.  Do your best to at least slow down his decision cycle (keep him from making a bad decision for his organization) which prevents your low-flying competitor from early success.  You can do this by offering a very limited version of your product for him to review that matches your competitors features, or ask to delay the decision until you've had a chance to show your product to other stakeholders.  There's some chance the buyer is simply using the other company as a negotiation tool to get your price down.<p>In which case, ignore it.  Find the customers who see their problem clearly, and why your specific solution takes care of their needs better than anything else, an concentrate your efforts on them.<p>Also, if you haven't read SPIN Selling by Neil Rackham, consider doing so when you get some time.<p>Good luck!",1211989607

I didn't see a lot of flashy twitter style ""eyeball-first"" companies. I saw companies like REAL Software, Red Gate, SourceGear and Atlassian, companies that making money and hiring people and growing fast and selling software. Michael Arrington was nowhere in sight. There were relatively few VC-funded companies and almost no companies whose business model was to build a thingamajig, get on Techcrunch, attract 10,000 eyeballs, and flip to Google... the cost of attending made it a very very serious crowd who learned a lot and most of whom will come back for a second year, I think.<p>If you're a serious software company and you'd like to learn from people who have been in your position and have a bit more experience than you, there's no better place to do this. The speakers are the least of it, since everything they say can be found on the web in 30 different places. Personally I learned the most from a hallway conversation with the head of sales at Red Gate where I learned how (and why) to hire an inside sales department; that hallway conversation was game changing for Fog Creek.

The Algorithm Design Manual is a great book, but seems to focus more on giving a tour of different problem types and their associated algorithms than developing a deeper understanding of the theory behind it all. Cormen&#x27;s book is fantastic and very thorough, but may be a bit harder to soak in for a beginner. Finally, while TAOCP could probably be considered the most revered texts on CS, they are not well-suited for a beginner trying to get their feet wet.<p>All in all, I&#x27;d say Sedgewick is the best of these options.",1439258252

There are a lot of PR firms; show right away what makes yours different.<p>Couch it in friendly language, like: &quot;We&#x27;d love to help you X! For $400 a month, we&#x27;ll Y to help you get there--or check out our other pricing plans [here].&quot;<p>When people see &quot;Sign up for free!&quot; on a web site, they&#x27;re used to having it mean, &quot;Give us your email and we&#x27;ll send you a ton of ads for free until you hit unsubscribe!&quot; So, not a great tactic. Being up-front with your deal in that space instead will make you seem a lot more legitimate.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty good writer.

It may have been meaningful at one point and I can see where you&#x27;re getting it, but it&#x27;s become an overused buzzword. Avoid. Plus, you&#x27;re using two sentences to say not very much. It&#x27;s just clutter.<p>How about: &quot;Publicize is a PR company tailored to the needs of lean, fast-growing technology startups. Here are some of the services we offer:&quot; and then list your services so it doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re just randomly stuck there.<p>>&quot;I had a great time working with publicize&quot;<p>Did you mean to capitalize &quot;Publicize&quot;? From what I can see, it&#x27;s not one of those always-lowercase names. Be careful about how you represent the writing on your web site, especially if you&#x27;re offering a service that manages press releases! Capitalizing your company name is like fixing a spelling error; it doesn&#x27;t invalidate the quote as long as you&#x27;re not intentionally trying to warp what he said.<p>Greg Laughlin&#x27;s review sounds genuine and earnest, but it has a problem: its sentence structure doesn&#x27;t quite flow. I suggest basically keeping it how it is to preserve the quote, but maybe make Alan Grant&#x27;s review the one that shows by default instead. It has a more professional feel, better punctuation, and better flow.<p>Just suggestions! It looks like you&#x27;ve gotten a lot of good feedback already on this, but a little bit of polish on the writing on your site would really make it shine. When you&#x27;re a PR firm, you have to really make sure your own marketing is stellar.

And even totally-unusable stuff - like perhaps that glove - can always be ground up and used as propellant in some sort of crude thruster (perhaps by ionizing the resulting bits of junk and pumping it out an ion engine, or perhaps by vaporizing it into various pressurized gases).<p>And there are plenty of abandoned satellites up there, too.  If a satellite breaks down (often because of the sheer quantity of space junk pelting it every waking moment, by the way), it&#x27;s not really feasible to go and repair it, so the usual approach is to wait for its orbit to eventually decay (which isn&#x27;t entirely feasible in higher orbits) while possibly launching a replacement.  There are likely whole satellites or significant fragments thereof ready for repurposing.<p>This isn&#x27;t to mention the presence of things like launch stages sitting in orbit (at least one Saturn V launch stage, for example, is in a near-Earth heliocentric orbit and is tracked as if it were a near-Earth asteroid; Apollo 10&#x27;s lunar ascent module is also - as far as we know - intact and in a heliocentric orbit, though its location has been unknown since 1969).

The ISS also gets pelted by golf-ball-sized-or-smaller bits of debris regularly enough that all the modules are built with whipple armor designed to withstand such constant pelting.<p>It&#x27;s really closer to walking a few thousand miles in a world where all the air molecules are replaced by bullets.  The tiny bits can likely be caught pretty easily by setting out a large, flat ablative shield to catch them with.  The bigger bits are tracked on radar and can therefore be sought after specifically by a recovery craft.",1439257354

Alphabet is actually less than the sum of its; Google is a highly profitable ad business that&#x27;s still showing nice growth.  The rest is a hodge-podge of startups and fantasies that provide neither revenue nor profit and have little chance of ever doing so.  Most of them don&#x27;t even have products.  There&#x27;s no reason to think that what is being taken out of Google was helping its business in any way, yet the market right now is willing to pay big option premiums on the remote chance of some future success.  So what is now Alphabet would be worth more if Google were spun out entirely to its existing shareholders, because they&#x27;d get whatever Google is plus whatever people are willing to pay for the imaginary stuff.  As a whole, it&#x27;s just Google less a lot of its profits.  None of this was true of Sun.",1439254868

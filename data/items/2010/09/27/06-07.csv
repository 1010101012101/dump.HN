Most outgoing people love making more friends, even if they have little in common on the surface and if you program you can always repay their social skills by designing a webpage for their latest party or social networking profile.

It was a philosophy course taught by a law professor, even if it was, for the most part, a math course.<p>The way he had setup the class was that he'd give lecture for three days out of the week, give us two week long assignments, and nothing else.<p>These limits were extremely reasonable, he went far and beyond in explaining a lot of concepts in easy to understand language, and he was a <i>tough</i> grader.  But everyone came away anyway with at least a 3.5 or higher in the class.<p>Why?  Because he was also very very reasonable with the workload.  The assignments were anything but busy work - he gave two weeks because he <i>really</i> wanted everyone to absorb the material before tackling the mind crushing assignments.<p>There was another math class I took in college (that I failed miserably) - it was a senior level analysis class.  I think within the first week or two, I was on the list to give a proposed solution to a problem in the problem set.  Within two or three seconds of giving a solution, a fellow student shot me down and the professor said in front of everyone that ""it was alright, it just meant I didn't understand the material.""

And we became fan of this guy: http://www.youtube.com/user/KlazartSC. He basically commentates the match in English because we can't understand Korean.\nBut he eventually retired because it takes too much time to download the source video from Youtube, cast, record, synchronize manually, encode and put it back on Youtube.\nSo, we came with an idea: create a nice service that does all these tasks easily and full web.\nWe did it! I've actually, talked about it in NH and TechCrunch France also covered us.<p>BUT, it's a fail. lol.\nThe feedbacks we received we're all pretty good BUT no one really uses it.<p>Marketing fail. We had the wrong target. We wanted to target the video game players but they were looking for Ustream, Livestream or JustinTV live video synchronization which we can't do because their API don't have stuffs like Timestamp.\nWhat we could do is synchronize with Youtube video but people prefer to use offline tools to do their ""VOD cast"" because they are not afraid of doing hard-job and spending hours and hours to do something ""perfect"". \neLive is meant to help people to cast easily and quickly, not meant to be a Adobe Premier online :/<p>So we are now thinking about re-positioning our service. Actually, eLive could be used for many applications such as singing Karaoke or giving a lecture or just doing an interactive video/audio podcast, alone or with friends.<p>Do you have any idea, guys?\nHave you ever failed in doing something but eventually succeed in re-doing it in another way?\nThanks about that ;)",1285567354

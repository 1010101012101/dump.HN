It's a fluff piece about a very promising <i>new bulb technology</i>. The new bulb uses an unusual LED immersed in a ""non-toxic"" liquid.  In theory it should have vastly better color temperature / light quality than existing LED bulbs.<p>I'd be happy to buy these things at $20 -- have my cake (carbon footprint) and eat it (light quality, no mercury release on disposal) -- but they don't exist yet.  All the LED bulbs I can buy today are basically purple, like the early CFLs.   Maybe it's fine for lighting a closet, but they're not adequate to night-time illumination of my home.<p>Call me when Switch bulbs are actually on the shelf!",1310050696
2738687,comment,2738294,2738539,2,0,weeny,,,"another comparison to CFLs.  the mercury arc in a CFL is struck between two electrodes, and every time the light is switched on the electrodes degrade.  So if you are energy conscious and only have the light on a few hours at a time - you will burn through the CFL much faster.  This isn't the case with LEDs - so if you have a light that you use 1 hour a day, you could definitely stretch it out to 30 years.",1310050679

It drives me nuts.<p>2) I am so tired of going back between which to choose: LLC, S-Corp and C Corp. I have a few lawyer friends who are offering to do the incorporating for free.  But then I have a fear that, what if my product actually make it big(!), they might change their mind and will want a lot of money later. My irrational fear of trusting anyone and everyone scares me.<p>3) I don't know whether I should incorporate a company just for the product I am building, or do I incorporate 1 business and then treat the product like a ""made by BUSINESS-NAME""; that way, I can build more products in the future and not having to start a new business each time.<p>With all these fear and anxiety, I push forward.

They don't click on strange icons or try new things just because they can. They don't explore because they don't understand, and in my experience they usually think that something will go wrong and they will break the computer if they click somewhere they aren't supposed to. It's hard for us to imagine someone going in with no prior knowledge of how a program is <i>supposed</i> to behave.

Stack Overflow is one of the best programming Q&A sites; most programmers these days will come across it doing Google searches for questions they have, there are a lot of very knowledgable people there, and so on. I feel like a lot of the Stack Exchanges don't have anything like that level or penetration; they are not well established in their communities, instead they are places for programmers and sysadmins who are familiar with Stack Overflow to talk about topics they are interested in, without actually attracting the expert community that makes some of the sites work so well.<p>Part of the problem, I think, is that some topics are just much more suited to objective questions and answers than others.

In other topics, what people really want is subjective discussion, polls, and so on, which just don't fit the Stack Exchange model well.<p>I wouldn't quite say that Stack Exchange has been successful in its expansion.

What broken laws should justify removal?<p>Should this be before or after they allow them to advertise? If before, this would inconvenience the majority of advertisers who are legitimate. If after, should Google investigate every incoming report of illegitimate advertising? Or, how many reports should warrant an investigation by Google?<p>Regardless, can Google remove these Adword listings without legal issues (i.e. without risking being sued)?<p>Getting these scammers off the front page of search would be relatively easy - it can be solved algorithmically. They're probably working on it now, with their anti-linkspam initiative.<p>But I don't see how Google could get them off Adwords without employing hundreds or thousands of people to review advertisers, but this would create more problems of greater magnitude than it would solve.<p>They could crowdsource it to narrow the (retrospective) review process, but this would create a secondary market of advertising, which I doubt Google wants, nor users would want to deal with.<p>I can't think of a way for Google to solve this problem without creating larger ones.<p>It's the responsibility of governments -- not internet advertising platforms -- to police copyright law.",1310047256

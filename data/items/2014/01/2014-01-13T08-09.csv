The clinic cat (&#x27;Tom&#x27;) was a three-legged , diabetic male who&#x27;d become completely at ease with all the visiting pet traffic.<p>One day, Tom ambled round a corner into the waiting area to get to his patch of sun in the middle, just as someone entered with a pretty big rottweiler; the dog saw Tom and started to bark and growl, but Tom just looked up and stayed in his warm spot in the middle of the room.<p>The dog just stared at Tom as if trying to work out why the cat hadn&#x27;t moved. After a few more grunts, the dog just sat in a corner and wouldn&#x27;t take his eyes off Tom. When the owner was called into the consulting room, the dog crept low around the perimeter of the room, working hard to keep as far away as possible and not letting Tom out of his sight - he was really spooked by the laid-back cat. Funniest &#x27;stand off&#x27; I&#x27;ve ever seen.",1389603546

I am stunned that a mere web page can do that for any one in actual reality. You seem far too easily bought. Here, have a shiney thing, there you go...... I had no idea people were so easily manipulated, and equally happy to say so in public.<p>I really don&#x27;t get on with these scroll down animated sites.<p>As usual with these things, I don&#x27;t see anything useful or informative on the landing part of the page, begin to scroll, see I&#x27;m expected to scroll for god knows how long incase there is anything useful, all I usually see is show off animation, I sigh, then close the page.<p>Why am I suddenly expected to constantly scroll these things? Is it just so some web developer can show off their latest, now tired, seen it all before now, trick?<p>I want to land on a page, see if its worth anything, then possibly click for more info. If I want to see an animation, video, or what ever, just show the darn thing in a normal video. But I want a choice there, not a silly site that auto starts it, often hurting my ears, or waking up the house, with full volume in the process. If the landing page gives me interest, I&#x27;ll happily watch a  short advert, animation, or whatever to get more info.<p>Why all this scrolling? There are much simpler ways to show all this, without me having to almost work to get to see it. Its not my message, its theirs. Why are they making it harder for me to see their message? I just left the page.<p>Just me?<p>Oh, BTW, I have some magic beans for sale on a pretty website. Any takers?",1389603341

In those, having source code distribution makes perfect sense, even preferable when the libraries are fairly simple and that gives the freedom to compile them as one wishes.

Exposing resources through volumes?<p>If your application is simple, then sure, you can get away with almost any deployment and provisioning approach and it&#x27;ll work &quot;well enough&quot;.  But these linking capabilities and products like Chef exist for more complex scenarios, and it would do you well to investigate the rationale behind them before being so dismissive.<p>I currently have a requirement to run 100s of applications provided by mutually untrusted 3rd parties, and co-ordinate startup/shutdown (for backup) and RPC access to these applications.<p>I need to be able to start an arbitrary combination of these applications on a node, depending on load (I cannot foresee the bandwidth/CPU requirements of each application without running it, and it will change unpredictably over time, sometimes to the point where a 1Gb/s link will be saturated by a single application for a few hours, and then change again to a trickle).<p>Sometimes I need to start multiple copies of this infrastructure for independent services that I may need to bring up/down independently.<p>In my scenario, using Docker alone to deploy the whole caboodle is not a maintainable solution.  Using Docker to package the untrusted applications and selectively expose just the volumes for backup and a single port to just the host control process (keeping applications from talking to one another), and Chef to deploy/undeploy applications to nodes in arbitrary and constantly varying configurations that automatically rewire themselves is very maintainable.<p>The way I use these tools:<p>- Chef/Puppet/etc. = infrastructure deployment and configuration management<p>- Docker = application deployment and confinement<p>This separation is useful because the operations people can do their job, and the developers can do theirs, without stepping on each others toes and with minimal co-ordination.  If you do everything in Docker, the ops team has a nightmare managing change in complex applications;  if you do everything in Chef, your developers suddenly have to become Chefs, which is overkill and will waste time co-coordinating with the ops people.<p>My example above is childs play compared to what some organisations need to deploy and manage.",1389600763

6733433,comment,6732676,6732676,25,0,stiff,,,"99% of people looking for information about big data and 99% of people looking to do data science, don&#x27;t have nowhere near big data, and don&#x27;t need to be taught hadoop. Those people are instead often lacking fundamental knowledge and are looking for a trick technological solution instead of reviewing their basics.<p>A &quot;data science&quot; track should hence be 90% about algorithms, data structures, linear algebra and computer architecture. People need to know how to compute with matrices, how to use B-trees, what R-trees are, what SIMD is, what cache locality is, what package to use for practical linear algebra, what the gpu is good for and when and how to use it. Teach databases, but include also some of the theoretical database stuff, and teach how to correctly use relational databases in the first place, since this is most commonly useful and people don&#x27;t really understand it. PostgreSQL is a real pearl, and few people know how much capability it has, how to use the geospatial indexing, the full-text search, how to do basic optimization and profiling.<p>Even for people who really do large scale computations, learning hadoop or mongodb (is anyone legitimately doing big data really using mongodb?) is just an afterthought, considering how much you have to learn first about mathematics, algorithms and computing to do anything sensible at that scale at all. If you bubble sort, MongoDB won&#x27;t save you. If you know the fundamentals already, you likely don&#x27;t need a separate course in mongo or hadoop.<p>For people looking to learn something more genuine, I would recommend, for example, this book:<p><a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html</a>",1384448339

6733421,comment,6732309,6733252,2,0,JunkDNA,,,"They do this to a certain extent, but the problem here is that the &quot;R&quot; part of &quot;R&D&quot; is not really at issue. While there&#x27;s a lot of focus in the popular press on &quot;finding&quot; new antibiotics, that part can be addressed by basic research grants. I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re wanting for proof of concept kinds of things. Unlike with engineering, where once you&#x27;ve got a proof of concept, you can refine and iterate to make it production quality, biology is completely arbitrary.<p>The issue comes with the &quot;D&quot; part of R&D. That is the expensive part with drugs because you start having to do very tightly controlled animal model studies progressing further into clinical trials with humans. The popular notion that you &quot;discover&quot; a drug is not how things work in reality. Often you discover a whole raft of closely related chemical entities that appear to do what you think they do. You tweak based on further studies in order to improve efficacy and safety. But the system is sort of nondeterministic in the sense that even altering the structure slightly often has knock-on effects you can&#x27;t predict. Assuming you get something decent, that&#x27;s what gets made into the an actual medicine. There&#x27;s a whole branch of applied chemistry that specializes in this called medicinal chemistry. In many cases, you&#x27;ll read about some promising new antibiotic that has been discovered in an academic lab, but once the chemists take a look at it, you realize there&#x27;s no way to make a drug out of it. The reasons can be any or all of: the therapeutic dose would be too high, it blows out the liver, it can&#x27;t be made into pill, the compound is unstable and can&#x27;t have a good shelf life, it can&#x27;t be taken orally, etc... Working out all those kinds of problems has always been the realm of pharmas and biotech startups. Academics aren&#x27;t interested in that stuff because it&#x27;s not basic research, it&#x27;s highly applied and is mostly trial and error based on decades of doing this kind of work.<p>At a macro-level, this is fundamentally what ails the entire pharma sector right now. The development part of making drugs is so expensive and such a complete and utter crap-shoot, that few new drugs of <i>any</i> sort are actually being produced. The last decade has been one of prolonged decline in the industry in terms of truly new drugs and there is no obvious mechanism available to us to make it less so.",1384448254

I have been using Dart since it was announced and the only downside I have experienced so far was that I had to rewrite half my code every two weeks as the language changed, although this was entirely expected.<p>Now that the language is a stable target I am really looking forward to seeing what sorts of libraries can come forward and also how performance can improve using the VM on the server side.<p>Warning: The rest of this comment is somewhat controversial and speculative. Feel free to skip it if that is not what you want.<p>In the bigger scheme of things I have somewhat conflicted feelings about Dart. Google has been trying very hard over the last few years to kill whatever positive feelings I had towards it for their open-source, open-web stance.  A million little things like dragging their feet on chrome/webkit prefixes, google+ infiltrating everything, etc, etc have made me more appreciative than ever for Firefox and Mozilla. But in the 2 years since Dart was announced it has gone from a basic spec and vm to a fully functional and pretty great language and vm, while Javascript has languished in committee as more slop is packed in while the basics (numerical types, non-terrible type coercion) are ignored.  The current target is a late 2014 release date. How much further will Dart and its VM be by then!?<p>I love Dart for what it lets me do right now, and for its commitment to compiling to javascript so everyone can use it. But it&#x27;s hard to trust that google won&#x27;t use it as some sort of competitive weapon in the future.

No matter how good you are, everyone is not going to like you. No matter how bad you are, someone is going to like you anyway.

This is also well understood in Silicon Valley, where some of the most successful entrepreneurs are clearly and openly jerks - but who are revered anyway.<p>Complicating matters is that the standards of jerkiness change. It used to be that cussing made you a jerk. No longer true. There is a strong cadre of egoists constantly looking to eliminate the association between &quot;selfishness&quot; and &quot;jerkiness&quot; - with surprisingly effective results.<p>Last but not least, the public likes to witness the degradation of others.

(And they get what they want because people are willing to have almost anything done to them in exchange for attention, including being demeaned.)<p>Most YouTubers who make original content, like Vi Hart, are not doing it for attention. They aren&#x27;t willing to participate in pop culture sado-masochism. What Google has unwittingly done is force this unhealthy dynamic on content creators.<p>The solution, of course, is to give content creators more control over their comments, over the community of people that consume their work. That is entirely possible from a technical point of view and I think would address this problem to everyone&#x27;s satisfaction.",1384447981

This post is one very clear example of exactly why it&#x27;s a real problem.<p>I can see at least two ways to address it without spending more money on moderators. 1. Allow volunteer moderation and trust those moderators like Stack Overflow does. This is a solution that has been proved workable time and time again. 2.

As much as every business is becoming a software business,  you have to stop seeing your value only in your technical skills,  because they alone are only a part of any solution.<p>The real value is being a bridge between business and technology. A hybrid who can understand business and technology. There&#x27;s no shortage of business consultants, and developers don&#x27;t always get the whole picture.  What is always in high demand is the few who get both, being able to put together technology with business in a way that magnifies and grows the competitive advantage of a customer, not reinterpreting how a business should be run.<p>This in turn means you have to find and have the conversations, be it on your blog or in your portfolio that shows your ability to understand and solve business problems.<p>Last,  but not least,  your opinion of odesk or elance is not ideal.

You guys have fixed that. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope that your site becomes a resource I rely on in the future. That being said, there are a few UX issues which would greatly improve signup rate and ease of use:<p>1. You should list all of the subjects on the home page not just 6 of them!!! The only way to view classes by subject is via search. But I want to be able to browse! Search is too much effort. Use this as an opportunity to list the highest rated classes by each subject. Put your data to good use.<p>2.  The only way to browse all classes by subject is by un-checking the subject box in a search results page, but if your browser width is over 1200px the filter results tab becomes static and you can&#x27;t see all of the subjects and filters :(<p>3. What is the main benefit of signing up? Add a CTA in between the search box and browse courses section of the homepage. Maybe also add a screenshot of the learning path, so I immediately know what benefit I am getting/why I shouldn&#x27;t just use your site to find courses on coursera or udacity.<p>4.

For the first 3 months imposter syndrome hit me hard and I wanted desperately to prove myself as a good developer, not to admit any spotty parts of my knowledge for fear of looking stupid. And then, like the article states, quickly googling it in my own time. It started seeping into my work - when I hit a problem I couldn&#x27;t solve, I&#x27;d spend days of time googling and trying things through trial and error when I had the best resource all around me: the other developers who&#x27;d seen this stuff 100 times before.<p>My manager at the time noticed this behaviour after a while and basically told me that the whole point of the internship is to learn, and no one would be surprised or disappointed if I didn&#x27;t know some minutae about the field I was working in. In fact, most people enjoy sharing their knowledge, it makes them feel smart and useful.<p>This doesn&#x27;t just apply on an internship - you might have been hired into a company as a respected, talented programmer, but the situation is still the same - you&#x27;re there to share your knowledge with others, and be shared with in return, and use that cumulative knowledge to build a product.<p>Once you&#x27;ve &#x27;looked stupid&#x27; once by asking a question, you&#x27;ll quickly realise it&#x27;s not so painful after all - and it saves the company a lot of time if you go &#x27;actually, I&#x27;ve not heard of that&#x27;, and it takes your colleague 5 minutes to explain, than having to Google for info and decipher Wikipedia articles and arcane documentation every time.",1384446633

Unlike baseball, where the most critical two players by far in any situation (the pitcher and the batter) are known in advance by both teams, a football play has the potential to be affected dramatically by any combination of players on the field. I am sympathetic to the idea that more teams should play aggressively on offense more often (and indeed I believe there are signs of this in today&#x27;s NFL), but by no means should every team be expected to act according to the punt/FG/go-for-it chart in most situations.<p>I think you&#x27;re absolutely right to emphasize variance tradeoffs.

Problem is, it never <i>was</i> taught, and of all the protocols I <i>did</i> take the time to learn, I learned the ones I was likely to run into most often in life.

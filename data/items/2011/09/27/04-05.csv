3041955,comment,3039873,3039873,1,0,phossal,,,"This is a well-written article. You've acknowledged an interview process, and you've provided very good advice for candidates who may encounter a similar one.<p>Ideally, both hirer and hiree would obtain perfect insight during the interview, and an alignment of skills, personalities and potential could be determined and made obvious to both parties.<p>We cannot obtain such insight, and yet hiring decisions are still made every day. Some work out, some don't.<p>As in most things, companies must optimize toward some strategy that produces results consistent with their priorities. If each of your programmers must be able to define - not just implement, but actually recall - breadth first, depth first, big-o notation, and others, I suppose your strategy will have to include such questions. What better way to determine whether your candidate can memorize definitions than to ask them for them?<p>But some parts of the common technical interview exist simply because the interviewers themselves aren't aware of any better strategy to obtain the insight that really matters. Is your culture easy-going? Do you need a certain kind of creative influence on your team? Is it really true that your programmers need to program algorithms at all?<p>My point is really quite simple: to alleviate the feeling that we're passing over good people, we should alter the interview process to give the candidate ample opportunities to show us they're a good fit (and that we're a good fit for them. For the record, I never accept offers from companies that ask me lexical structure or algorithm questions, especially if those questions are posed by peer-level interviewers - it suggests a non-performing competitive rather than cooperative atmosphere). We should identify, if we can, the priorities of our team, and then attempt to find a strategy that is optimized for presenting the candidates we're seeking in a favorable light.<p>(I'm leaving this comment because you've written a post that is less about improving the recall or application of algorithms, and more about helping a candidate show you they're capable.)",1317099477

Sure, there are plenty of inexpensive plans but you also want to find one that will cover all your needs and will keep you protected in the event of an unexpected medical emergency. Some of the more affordable health insurance plans will be less money each month but could also come with high deductible and high co-insurance costs for the covered person or persons.\nSearching for the most affordable health insurance is as easy as doing an internet search. You can find many different companies that can give you affordable health insurance quotes from several different companies all at once. They also give you the option to customize your plan by adding or removing coverage options that you need or dont need.\nYou will find that affordable health insurance is much more achievable for those who are in good health, have a good family health background, have no pre-existing conditions and have been tobacco and nicotine free for at least 12 months.\nIf your employer doesnt offer a health insurance plan or if you are unemployed or even self-employed you can find affordable health insurance rates online, fill out the application form and get approved without having to go into an insurance office and hassle with insurance agents.\nPurchasing affordable health insurance should be taken seriously; not every plan is equal and you will want to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions of your health insurance plan as well as all of your available options for coverage. If you are low-income you might even find that your state might offer an affordable health insurance option for you. This can help you save a lot of money and the health insurance plans offered by most states give you all the coverage you need to keep yourself protected.\nIf you ever have a question about a health insurance plan you should call the customer service and talk to a specialist before you apply or sign a contract. They can help you with any questions or concerns you have about your coverage, your monthly payment, and your deductible and co-insurance costs as well as help you find a doctor in your area that is covered by the plan.\nAffordable health insurance doesnt have to mean less coverage. It is possible to find an inexpensive plan that will give you all the coverage you need with little monthly costs. There are several health insurance websites that can help you to find low monthly rate affordable health insurance plans along with low deductibles and low co-insurance costs. All you have to do is fill in your zip code, your age and check whether you are a smoker or not, and if you are a student. This will bring up many different options for coverage from a variety of different insurance companies that are available in your area.\nOnce you find the one you want you will be redirected to the health insurance companys webpage where you can find out more about the plan, find out if the plan covers your doctor, you will also find that many insurance companies will give you the option to apply and get approved online!",1317098478

They know that your account is associated with these IPs based on tracking cookies. So, when they see a request from one of these IPs without the cookie, they can do a reverse lookup to get a list of possible accounts. That narrows the field. Next they can do a semantic analysis of the page that had the Like button which sent the request, and compare that to pages previously associated with the possible accounts.

My mobile phone provider uses transparent proxying for its mobile Internet - I must share the same external IP as thousands of other people when I browse the web via my phone.

So, 2,100 is multiplied by 12 to get $25,200.  Then, it's divided by the number of square feet in the apartment, which is 800 square feet.  That leads to $31.50 dollars per square foot.",1317096647

3041828,comment,3040937,3041705,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"You keep using that word ""unskilled"", I do not think it means what you think it means. Whether it's farm work, factory work, or service industry work it's disingenuous to call it ""unskilled"". It requires a different genre of skills than office work, typically, but there are nevertheless many levels of skill and substantial differences in work quality and productivity depending on experience levels. A lot of the jobs you have put into the ""unskilled"" bag have extensive formal education programs, for example.<p>On a more personal note, I find this commonplace bigotry against the working class to be appalling and indicative of limited and closed minds. The idea that there is this huge labor pool of second class citizens, gammas or such-like, that is barely above the level of trained chimp, and their skills are so minor it's just a matter of time before the smarties of the world replace them with superior robotics, is disgusting. It is a fantasy. And worse it's a very derogatory and prejudicial fantasy.",1317096473

Its section on the New Testament has a list of the major textual problems, most of which have their own wikipedia articles.<p>If you want to get into books, David Alan Black wrote a fairly nice introduction to New Testament textual criticism.  Bruce Metzger and Kurt Aland's books are both pretty widely respected as well.

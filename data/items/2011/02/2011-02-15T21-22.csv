The above would be true if it was only 11.14 that needed to be dealt with.  I hadn't yet seen the text for 11.13.  Given the text for 11.13, it seems like everything from Evernote and Instapaper to Pandora and Netflix would be affected.<p>11.13

It's hard to find a definitive answer. gcc supports Objective-C, and Apple open sources CF-Lite, but apparently and confusingly, that is only a subset of Core Foundation.<p>I make OpenGL videogames but my code is written in Objective-C (long story) and so currently only supports iOS and OS X. I feel almost at home with ObjC and my codebase, I enjoy the features mentioned in this article, and it's performant enough for what I need, but I'm reaching a point where I wish my core logic code was multi platform (from PS3 to Android including iPhone). Moving to C++ would mean learning C++ and best practices (which sounds quite daunting to beginners) and rewriting the whole codebase, but the lack of practical documentation on the portability of Core Foundation looks like a big neon sign that dropping Objective-C is the only reasonable way towards a cross-platform codebase.",1297807127

It's generally not that critical for a receiving antenna.<p>Sticking up almost any wire more than a few wavelengths long will collect a reasonable amount of a strong signal. A truly resonant antenna for the frequency you're interested is a lot better, but not that helpful for general HDTV viewing where the frequencies range all over VHF and UHF.<p>One of the amazing things I've learned from years of ham radio is how many unseen and unpredictable things affect radio signals. You can move your antenna twelve inches to the left and lose a signal completely, especially inside a structure. Or an airplane flying overhead can reflect enough ""multipath"" signal to wreck your TV viewing for 30 seconds. Of course your own body blocks a lot of signal and is capacitively coupled to the antenna system as you adjust it. So if you're playing with an HDTV antenna and are too young to remember the fun of constantly adjusting TV rabbit ears, just keep tweaking until you get a good signal.",1297807112

Difficult to get a clear picture of the overall status of projects. Project managers have to spend a lot of time gathering status updates and creating reports because we use so many different tools, and the built-in reporting generally sucks.<p>3. Lack of intuitive structure within data. An ideal PM platform would structure information in an intuitive way that to make it discoverable by people working on peripherally related projects.<p>Specific gripes w/Basecamp:<p>1. Don't get notifications when clients upload files, only when they post messages (they often don't understand the difference)<p>2. Checkboxes to send out email notifications are not checked by default for new messages. Clients <i>always</i> forget to do this, even when we remind them, and then wonder why we don't respond right away.<p>3. Refusal to use gantt charts.

""The Amazon question (which originally sparked a debate a couple weeks ago) seems more complicated. Because Amazon content isn’t sold by subscription, it’s not clear how this affects apps like their Kindle app. It may not affect it at all, but then why did Apple reject the Sony reader app? Was there a subscription layer in it? Apple clearly wants to move towards a full in-app purchase environment, but today they’re only talking subscriptions. One-time payments may be the next shoe to drop.""<p>Update: A couple more things. Apparently, Apple has just updated the App Store Guidelines alongside the announcement today. And yes, it seems that one-time in-app purchases like those made through Amazon for the Kindle will fall under the same rules. That brings up another question: could Amazon just make a Kindle reader app that didn’t allow you to buy anywhere in the app, but only use previously bought content? The guideline wording seems like it would still be a no-no but it’s not entire clear that such an app would be rejected.

Most OO programs are graphs (picture as a complex web) of mutable objects holding references to one another, synchronously passing control from one object's method to the next (picture as a spider travelling around the web, making modifications). Concurrency means there is more than one logical point of control flowing around the graph, making modifications. To ensure modifications are consistent, one must now fight against the interconnected nature of this graph, and make certain areas mutually exclusive; that means you need to set up gates on all the edges leading into those areas (often called semaphores or mutexes).<p>But OO gives you precious little help in setting aside these areas, and guaranteeing internal consistency in the face of multiple mutating points of control.<p>Programs in a functional style are different, with their heavy emphasis on immutability. In this case, the web, as it were, is fixed and cannot be changed; instead, if there is to be a modification, a new copy is created (possibly only of the local area of change, and the unchanged portion included via references). Since there is no way to change data, there can be as many points of control performing operations as desired. (Actually, one of the models of computation used for functional programs is that of graph reduction, which pictures the program as a web of expressions rather than structures; and that big expression is iteratively made smaller by calculating different parts of it. In principle, the more points of control you have doing these calculations, or reductions (in the same way as '1 + 2' can be reduced to '3'), the better.)<p>Programs written in an agent / actor style are also different. Here, there is no single point of control flowing from one node in the graph (web) to the next; instead, each node has its own little point of control, and it reacts to messages coming in from each edge, and sends out messages along edges in response. This makes the program locally single-threaded, but globally concurrent.",1297805294

I'm currently building a backbone-based frontend in a very similar way, only without the node.js counterpart - yet.<p>One problem I immediately see in this hybrid approach is the requirement to keep the state for all [active] users in memory on the server. This does not scale well - which is why conventional web development tries to be as stateless as possible.<p>It's not hard to remedy this <i>partly</i> by adding basic lazy-fetching and cursor capabilities to Collection. But you lose some of the most interesting features in the process (push-notify on changes), and preserving those at the same time becomes much more tricky then (bordering on classical ORM problems).<p>There's also still ground-level stuff missing in Backbone, i.e. the support for recursive updates of nested collections (e.g. from one big, nested json blob) is just not there yet. A few approaches have been discussed, but afaik not implemented yet. The models need to be beefed up with some sort of schema (e.g. json-schema) to truly solve this one.<p>However, none of that is insurmountable. All it takes is some more of the smartness that the Backbone developers have already demonstrated. And elbow grease.<p>For example I'd love to see backbone paired with 'dnode' or a similar RPC approach. That might open amazing possibilities.",1297805281

2223291,comment,2222933,2223045,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Is that network worth 30% of the selling price in all cases? Does ""one size fits all"" really apply here. As an example, it's already been pointed out in plenty of places that Amazon doesn't have 30% to give to Apple, even if it wanted to. They are locked in to agreements with publishers that demand a 70% cut.<p>I can identify with them as well. I work with a good friend in the publishing market who has a product that they want to bring to iOS. His product facilitates the delivery of interactive book content from publishers and distributors to schools and libraries. Neither the publishers, distributors, nor the schools seem to have even the beginning of an idea on how to solve the problem themselves, yet his business model would be wholly incompatible with the Apple pricing model. As a facilitator, his company only makes a couple of dollars on the sale of each SKU. I just sat across the table from him at lunch today and recommended that he stay as far from the Apple App Store as possible. Going back to the table and requesting an additional 30% from publishers and distributors would get him laughed out of the room.<p>The greater point is that by applying a fixed 30% fee to all in-app purchases, Apple is excluding many different business models that might otherwise be developed on their platform. I know they have their reasons, and Apple is famous for disregarding edge-cases in favor of simplicity for the larger market, but there are a <i>lot</i> of models that flatly don't fit this fee structure. Anyone whose margin is less than 30% simply cannot move product through the Apple App Store.<p>Businesses stuck in this position have to decide which will be more costly and difficult: retooling their business model to accommodate an additional 30% margin, or avoiding the Apple ecosystem altogether and finding another way to reach their market. In my opinion, an extra 30% of margin is not easy to find in any business, much less the cut-throat content publishing space.",1297803919

2223287,comment,2221831,2222948,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Progressive enhancement disagrees. OK well maybe not quite but all the new features ...<p>Really? How do you progressively enhance a video site to use HTML5 video, or a site-wide menu system to use CSS3 transitions? The alternatives are things like Flash and JavaScript, which we have been using for a while anyway. However, if you have to write the Flash/JavaScript version anyway, where is the benefit in also supporting HTML5 and CSS3?<p>Progessive enhancement is a great idea for minor details, like having a site use a subtle rounding on corners when a browser supports it but just square cutting them otherwise if that's the visual effect you're looking for. However, in a world with desktop vs. mobile sites, persistent local storage, multimedia content, etc., it's becoming ever clearer that the idea of a single page with progressive enhancement doesn't scale to support fundamental functionality in a complex web app or interactive site, and multiple versions of the presentation/functionality are needed to cope with the ever increasing and diversifying range of visitors we need to support.",1297803827

Small, related projects or activities that can somehow help you make progress in your main startup idea isn't a bad thing.<p>What happens is that if someone joins your startup and he is more interested in earning money than the implementation of idea itself, he will try to convince you that your idea is going nowhere and you should put it on hold for sometime, may be for a year or two and do some other things like consultancy, web design etc. to earn money. Thing is that you will get dragged into other unrelated activities(that you don't enjoy doing) and will waste the time you should be utilizing to work on your primary project. In this case, your and your partner's objective aren't aligned. Such people tend to switch projects too often as they want quick money. You will find yourself switching from project A to project B to project C and it all will be a big mess. After a year or two you will realize that you have failed in all of those, your partner isn't interested in continuing anymore and you are at same place where you started, all alone.<p>Thats why point no. 2 - Get a cofounder who is ""genuinely interested"" in your idea.

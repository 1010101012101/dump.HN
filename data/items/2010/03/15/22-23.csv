Labs post programs (or their biological equivalents, protocols) on their websites all the time.<p>Don't forget that data can be polished as well - for a hypothetical cheater, you'd simply be moving the ""messaging""  work from the finished project to the source files you mention above.  There's a lot more to trusting a paper then just trusting the figures; you're trusting the scientific process that a lab is undertaking, and it's almost always impractical to require proof of every stage of that process.<p>Another downside is that not every scientist is ok with giving access to all of their hard-earned data - that opens up analyses and potential scoops to other groups.  This is especially true in biomedical/clinical studies, where data is <i>very</i> expensive to gather and can take years to analyze.  Not saying raw data is never shared, but there is a balance there.<p>Finally, scientists greatly prefers testing a published claim by pursuing a follow-up hypothesis rather then redoing an existing analyses.  That way you kill two birds with one stone.  It's inevitable that some irreproducible results slip in with this system, but if the claims are significant enough sooner or later someone who's trying to build on the claims (and failing) will go looking for more details and the fraud is exposed.  The fear of being exposed in that way is what keeps the system honest, and to a large extent this system works.",1268693665

1194363,comment,1192625,1192625,0,0,nroach,,,"That's disappointing, given Obama's repeated public support for transparency.  Calling it a national security issue is absolute rubbish.<p>What scares me is that this will impact people's lives in a significant fashion, and yet the public doesn't really understand the ramifications.<p>I don't think that most people in the United States know that treaties are considered the law of the land under the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, negotiation of treaties is a ""presidential monopoly"". Just like an ordinary contract, the details are hammered out in negotiations between the signatories long before a presidential pen signs the treaty. (<a href=""http://post.ly/T22n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://post.ly/T22n</a>)<p>This is the phase where the ""meat"" of the treaty is decided.  After it's been signed, congress is only involved through ratification.  ""[The executive branch] alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation, the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it"".  What that means is that treaties can be enacted, and U.S. citizens can be constrained based upon negotiations that take place between the President and the heads of state for other nations.  \nNormally, when laws are passed in Congress, the public has the ability to comment, lobby, and become involved in the process.  It doesn't always work, but on big-ticket items, people have a chance to at least voice their concerns to their representatives before a bill is passed.  An example is the pending health-care bill.  Whether you're for it or against it, the issue has been debated in public and voters can hold their representatives accountable if a bill is passed that doesn't  reflect the majority of voters is any given congressional district.<p>There's no such accountability in the ACTA negotiation process.  Of course, with copyright and MPAA heavy-hitters deeply ensconced in the DOJ, I'm not surprised.

It helps, I was so tempted to argue with your points as I had misread them.<p>I feel strongly about the primacy of privacy because the problems of prejudice are so severe. But the transparent world approach has a lot of depth to it, and I'm nervous and excited to see where it leads us, since like it or not it the technical and social changes we're seeing are creating so much data.<p>Here are the issues I think we have with this particular data release. I understand they may be resolvable though, and while  I argue against accepting privacy problems like this right now, I would definitely love to find out that we can shift to a more transparency society without reservation and without the level of abuse that I fear:<p>-- Information asymmetry, since most people don't typically keep the type of statistical skills, computing power, and even secondary data sets for cross joins and comparisons around. Information asymmetry is a widely recognized concern in social behavior and commercial law (i.e. insider trading & real estate contracts)<p>-- Ethical concerns seem to constrain us to taking people's own privacy expectations into account. Originally privacy loss didn't seem to be a problem, but the situation changed when evidence emerged to the contrary<p>-- History shows us that governments frequently overstep their bounds. Rather than argue recent events which are more clouded by emotion and the narrative of the day, I think most people would agree that the FBI in the 60s was quite abusive in their gathering and use of data<p>That said, transparent world all the way.

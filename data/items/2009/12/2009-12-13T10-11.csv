992627,comment,990323,990791,0,0,svv,,,"Banks make a bad analogy.<p>Sure, it should be the bank's responsibility to keep accounts safe.  However, the fact that bank accounts are considered to be ""safe"" is in a large part due to systemic factors like the existence of the Fed (as lender of the last resort), FDIC, general political climate of ""too big too fail"", etc.  As mentioned above, banks actually do go under a lot; it's just not as noticeable to the clients as before [the central banks], but the cost is there.  (And there's a whole discourse there of whether it's a good idea for monetary system to have this kind of environment in the long run.)<p>In any case, nothing of the sort applies to the hosting providers (or even can be applied, as insuring unique data is not the same as insuring amounts of money) -- so assuming that keeping data there is as safe as keeping money in the bank is not a viable comparison.",1260699412

992622,comment,992489,992489,0,0,Scott_MacGregor,,,"Nice idea, very timely. I like the simple artwork. You can collect a lot of work emails this way. If it were my site I would:<p>1. Have some more cute simple Santa, snowman, gifts artwork in the header area so it sets the mood for the customer when it pops open in the browser.<p>2. <i>""Maybe""</i> try for a more green and red holiday color theme vs the light blue which seems frosty but not so holiday like to me personally.<p>3. Put something on the right sidebar above the ads like a flash movie that is holiday related and funny enough and cute enough to get this passed from user to user via work email with a hey look at this video title to the email.  Something people will think unique enough to pass around at work to their email list. Then try to get people to email it as a link. Like a silly Rudolph the red nosed reindeer telling a joke or something that people will think is clever enough (and clean enough) to pass around to their email list.<p>4. Put in a hook to use it, free giveaway to someone or some work group of something small to medium sized. 10 $50 gift cards, etc...<p>5. Brand it at the top proudly with a logo, so people will remember the brand and come back to your site year after year.<p>6. Maybe think about moving the Google ads horizontal below the packages for better flow on the page.",1260698776

In the long term, wouldn&#x27;t it actually be better to let the market just naturally figure itself out?<p>As Keynes said, &quot;In the long run, we&#x27;re all dead&quot;.<p>The problem is that the &quot;long run&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually correspond to any specific duration of time or point in the future; it describes the aggregate, idealized behavior over time. There may actually <i>never</i> be any point at which the trading price of $XYZ[0] actually matches the underlying value, as long as the price over time tends to track the fundamental value[1].<p>On the other hand, an overfocus on optimizing for the short term causes stunted economies that never reach their full potential (in the best case) and a downward spiral with a negative feedback loop (in the worst case).<p>>  That way the end prices reflect the real value.<p>By the way, there&#x27;s actually no such thing as the &quot;end price&quot;, because nothing happens in a vacuum. Let&#x27;s say Google launches a new product today. It may take two years to figure out whether or not that product is going to be a success[2]. If they did nothing else in that time, then yes, there would be an &quot;end price&quot; after this event, but the real world is a series of overlapping events that are all playing out simultaneously[3]. So the market never has the chance to converge towards the &quot;end&quot; value after event A, because by that time, events B, C, and D are all having an effect on the system as well. That <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean that A&#x27;s effect is negligible; it just means that it&#x27;s never observed directly.<p>[0] By the fundamental theorem of calculus we would be guaranteed this at one moment, but prices aren&#x27;t actually continuous so this doesn&#x27;t apply<p>[1] The fundamental value, of course, can never be directly observed, as is often the case in statistics.<p>[2] Or even ten years, if we&#x27;re talking about self-driving cars.<p>[3] The word &quot;event&quot; here is a technical one, not a colloquial one: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_study"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_study</a>",1436305836

You cant &quot;amend away&quot; these things.<p>The quasi-religious <i>belief</i> that there are rights that exist &quot;in nature&quot; prior to law and which all governments are obliged to observe is a popular one -- and was with the founders -- and part of the basis for the use of the term &quot;inalienable right&quot;. However, the exact <i>parameters</i> of such &quot;inalienable&quot; rights are far from uniformly agreed even among those who subscribe to the belief that they exist. You absolutely <i>can</i> alter which of the rights that some people believe to be inalienable <i>are</i> protected by a government through amendments; note, for instance, that quite a lot of people from the time of the founding through (and no doubt <i>past</i>) the time when this was, <i>in law</i>, settled at the point of a bayonet by the 13th Amendment, thought that the widely-accepted-as-inalienable right to property included the right to hold human beings -- and particularly for <i>whites</i> to hold <i>blacks</i> -- as personal property.",1436305810

I did recruit an army of testers and volunteer readers though, which helped.<p>Fulfillment slowed me down a lot, especially since I released a paperback book rather than keeping it all digital (I really wanted to have something physical to take to events, plus designing an actual book is really fun.) I almost went with a local printer, as I wanted to support a local business... but their cost per book was ~$10, and going with a China-based printer (PrintNinja.com) dropped the book cost to $3.60 — I pretty much had no choice since I wanted to sell on Amazon (anything over $5 would kill my profit.) But being that it was printed in China, it added two months between submitting the print order to getting the books in hand, and I had a <i>lot</i> of people waiting for their books for about a year since the Kickstarter. It was really stressful, but at least now I know and can plan for this delay in the future.<p>Oh, and a shout-out to marketing, which this blog post obviously is. Of course I wish I could release the book and get revenue without effort, but that won&#x27;t happen. Self-promotion is really hard, and I&#x27;m learning how to market my products better but it&#x27;s really not that much fun and very stressful. Necessary though.",1436305728

I doubt a theater of people will respond to someone yelling &quot;fire&quot; unless the person was an authority figure of some kind, like a uniformed theater employee or police officer. Perhaps a person who yells fire very persistently and credibly will prompt a reaction: a few people will get up and look around, or inquire, but most people will wait for more information, especially if they see no evidence of a fire, and see other people investigating the alleged threat.<p>(If anything, most people wait too long to flee from fires. They only begin to flee once the danger is imminent and nearby.

But do people in Europe really feel a sense of solidarity with each other?<p>I&#x27;m from the UK, a country often lambasted for it&#x27;s aloof and isolationist attitude to Europe. I used to be embarrased by the scepticism shown by British MPs towards closer EU integration. Now, however, I&#x27;m just a bit indifferent. The reason? I&#x27;ve seen clearly that self-interest among European countries (almost) always trumps a greater collective good. Yet the press and politicians continue to pretend otherwise. I don&#x27;t blame individual countries for doing this, but I wish they would drop the pretence that they are pursuing a greater collective goal for Europe when in fact they are often pursuing a best-for-my-country approach. And who can blame them when it will always be to their own electorates that they must first appeal?<p>The migrant crisis in the Mediterranean really amplified this for me. I was ashamed of the UK response, but no other country was willing to share fairly the number of migrants rescued either. And even the rhetoric around Greece is rarely about solidarity and common European humanism, but instead about keeping the integrity of the financial system in place.<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33132595"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33132595</a>",1436303380

The Oberon and Bluebottle OS materials have always been quite scattered, so someone putting them in a central index is quite convenient.<p>For those unaware, Oberon&#x27;s main qualities are the fact that it&#x27;s a full operating system written in a garbage collected Pascal-like language (actually made by the same person who initially wrote Pascal) which uses said language&#x27;s module system to provide reusable/chainable interfaces throughout the whole OS, support for orthogonal persistence and most notably, its highly unconventional user interface that bridges the power of the CLI and the GUI together in this vaguely hypertext-like workspace where you can dynamically live program the UI itself through on-screen text that can serve as an entry point or continuation to perform all sorts of computations, things you&#x27;d normally write hacky scripts for. Closest analogue is Xerox&#x27;s Cedar.<p>You should consider trying it and stealing a few ideas from it for the greater good.",1436303070

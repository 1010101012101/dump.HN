It is absolutely normal that you don't get it when they teach you encapsulation, classes, functions, return values, arguments.<p>How did they get created or conceptualized in the first place? Why do we need them?<p>Do it the right way: Start with C, and start from the smallest and most fundamental constructs that C has: The structures and functions. Know that there was only assembler in the first place. Then look into how function calls are made. Disassemble the simplest function you have and understand its logic. Now you know why there is a function. Then go into the structure. Disassemble one. Put different types in it, see how they get laid out in memory.<p>Start as above, and learn how things work down to the last byte. Then eventually you will cover all constructs created and you will know where they come from. Do the above for 3-5 years, each time you encounter a new language idiom or concept.<p>Finally you will see that in all strongly typed languages most constructs are worthless and they get in your way. You will get back to using C ;-)<p>You might also go for the much higher level languages or different areas of computing, but since you showed interest in understanding programming deeper, this is the way to go.",1257619425

There's more than one way to do it, of course, but here's a sequence of languages that I would recommend:<p>Python: this will teach you to program at a higher level, and the libraries will make it easier for you to get into web programming or GUI programming or simple game programming or any other thing that excites you. That's what it's all about, when you're learning: do something that excites you, and you'll learn faster. Python has a very low barrier to entry, so try this first.<p>Lisp: once you know Python, you're not going to be bowled over by things like garbage collection. But you can still learn a lot from Lisp; if nothing else, it can give valuable practice with recursion and metaprogramming and the idea of a read-eval-print loop. It's a cool and fun language.<p>Haskell: this one is kind of difficult to learn, which is why I recommend learning it <i>after</i> you've got Lisp under your belt. A lot of advanced computer science stuff tends to debut in the Haskell community, and the average intelligence of Haskellers is pretty shocking. It's also a neat language that you can do cool projects with.<p>If you can learn these languages, I guarantee that you will be able to shift paradigms a lot easier than people who coasted along with the standard trio of C, C++, and Java.",1257618527

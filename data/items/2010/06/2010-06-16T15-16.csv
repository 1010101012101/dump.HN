Also we use big databases and our tests unfortunately aren't isolated - we have to prepare data manually for tests to run.<p>This tree-like approach looks great. One problem is - the only way I see to create ""stack of databases"" is to use savepoint - rollback to savepoint around every node in tests tree.<p>We use hibernate, so rollback to savepoint won't be enough - we'll need to disable second level cache, and to do sth about first level cache - maybe flushing after each rollback to savepoint will do.<p>Anybody has experience with hibernate and rolling back to savepoint?",1276703914

I'm 20 - and you're correct on this point.

Even turning on GC (as we have under OS X) isn't a panacea: there are plenty of Core Foundation kinds of calls that don't participate automatically in GC (you have to manually connect each such allocation to GC). And with ""unmanaged"" pointers at the C/Obj-C/C++ level, you'll always have to step gingerly around GC.<p>And he's right to think ahead 5-10 years and realize that we're probably not going to be doing manual memory management then.<p>So what's the way over the chasm? I don't think anyone really knows, even at Apple.<p>Perhaps (pure speculation) the MacRuby efforts are part of a back-up plan to see if a (""managed"" by definition) dynamic language could help bridge the gap without breaking the world.

We are supported by large technology companies and the first one I wish to announce is Intuit, with whom we are launching an online brainstorming and collaboration platform (available to use at <a href=""http://ideas.intuit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.intuit.com</a>).<p>I have been involved in two successful community initiatives as co-founder of the HeadStart Foundation which is a not for profit community platform that has grown from 15 people in 2007 to over 15000 people now and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Bangalore which is a professional association for computer science researchers and practicians which has grown to over 5000 people taking part in activities. What I have seen as 'gaps' in the startup and innovation ecosystem is what HeadStart Ventures has been set up for. These are -<p>1) angel investments : starting up and innovation is stifled in India due to lack of seed stage funding available today. Not that India lacks high net worth individuals, this is more due to lack of an effective organisation to manage angel money. HeadStart Ventures is setting up an 'angel fund' where we are involved in getting interested, experienced and able individuals to come together and manage seed stage investments. As an entrepreneur myself, I feel that going to angel networks that have slow decision making processes, too many people to talk to and a risk taking aversion similar to VCs in India is frustrating and the HeadStart Ventures fund will address this.<p>2) effective mentoring : mentoring startups in India is mostly done pro bono and the results are not too encouraging barring a few exceptions. Again, as an entrepreneur, I do not want 'help' from a mentor, I would much rather have a mentor who sets some milestones for us to achieve together and works on them. HeadStart Ventures is going to announce an incentive based mentoring initiative very soon and we are starting with workshops in July to start identifying startups to work with.<p>3) market access : one of the main reasons Indian startups reportedly do not display much innovation is because of the lack of knowledge about markets. 'Problem spaces' need to be defined and worked upon in collaboration with industry early adopters. HeadStart Ventures is therefore working on partnerships with large industry organisations to help accelerate time and relevance to market of Indian startups",1276702640

That's probably because my brain's depth perception mechanisms are used to adding in more cues than brains that can lean on perfect binocular vision do.<p>People tend to get really romantic about how brains work, so I should probably make something clear. When I say that my brain is more used to integrating multiple other environmental clues to get depth perception than brains with perfect stereoscopic vision, that's actually a <i>bad</i> thing. The resulting depth perception is clearly worse than good stereoscopic vision. I am lucky in that if I wear glasses, which I do not routinely, I can get true stereoscopic vision back; I do not lack the brain mechanisms entirely as some people with bad vision do. And that's clearly better. My brain is better adapted to degraded input, but it remains degraded input. Brains prefer stereoscopic vision when available because they naturally gravitate to the best sources of data.<p>Rolling back around to my main point, depth perception is a <i>great</i> deal more complicated than most people give it credit for. There's really two distinct depth perceptions, one using stereoscopic vision that only works out to a few tens of feet regardless of how good your vision, and one that works on the rest of the world using motion and occlusion cues and a variety of other things. These flashing pictures manage to fire some of my depth perception based on motion cues, but completely lack the precise depth perception I get from stereoscopic vision. There's really no such thing as a monolithic ""depth perception"", it's a lot of things that get integrated in the brain.",1276702204

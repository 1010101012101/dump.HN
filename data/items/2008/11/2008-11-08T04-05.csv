So, say software companies, should also have the same correllation between success and politics.<p>The free market argument can be applied to other investment firms.<p>The government intervention argument is trickier to test.  I don't know of another business that has the same setup as banks.",1226120384

People just heard ""tax.""<p>It's not entirely a clear data point, because they also had a leader perceived as weak. But the carbon tax was a big part of why he was perceived as weak.",1226118991

The answer is within the ""overlays"" given by guaranteed prizepools offered for some MTTs.<p>An example: On Sunday the 02/11/2008 the €250.000 Guaranteed Tournament at CelebPoker had a €320 Buy-In. 613 players registered for this tournament. Now the calculation fun begins!<p>First you have to divide the offered Prizemoney with the number of players who registered. In this example: €250,000 / 613 (players) = €407.<p>This means that your ticket is worth than €407. As your ticket costs €320, you are automatically gaining the equivilent of an extra €87 to pay for your entry (€407-€320 = €87). Ok, you don't get the cash in the bank, but you do get it as an advantage for the buy-in as you have less players to compete for the prizepool with.<p>You can easily calculate the number of players that turns a guaranteed tournament +-0 in added value if you divide the sum of guaranteed prizemoney with the Buy-In amount. In our example above it would be like this: 250.000 (€) / 320 (€) = 781.<p>That shows that when the number of players is equal or higher than 781 there is no added money in the prizepool. Therefore you dont get this extra value (overlay) for your registration. When you keep this kind of calculation in mind you can make use this overlay to your advantage by paying attention to the CelebPoker-MTT-Lobby.<p>Take these chances when you find these Overlays to pimp your bankroll! Good Luck!!",1226118339

I'm not saying that's what Mr. Gore is going to do, but Britney Spears set a bad example. Real voices are what make twitter interesting.<p>Yes, I know they're trying to monetize, but doing it honestly is probably going to work better in the long run.",1226117981

Most free things on the web use display ads for revenue (which is rarely a GREAT way to make money) and Facebook loses millions a year.<p>I think the Onyx plan is interesting but I don't think it will ""save"" the AppStore.  It is a cool little framework for building communities into GAMES.  Fine.  I take nothing away from that it is a great concept.  But there are plenty of apps that are not games [Disclaimer: assumption on my part because I don't own an iPhone].<p>What keeps the AppStore going is great applications, regardless of price, not frameworks.<p>He really presented a poor argument.

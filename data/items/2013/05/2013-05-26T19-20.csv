So the question is, how far below market rate?  If he was making 60-80K as you suggest, that's about 60-80K below market rate.  Which would mean that he took a huge risk for very little actual gain, especially since the bonus was probably taxed as regular income rather than capital gains.",1369598385

I'll also be doing some stuff for large companies looking to transition their organizational structure to a ""devops"" shop, which I hope helps me launch a consultancy.  There are a lot of things that developers can do to ensure they can scale, stay up, and not lose everything.  Worst case scenario, use a platform as a service (heroku etc) and outsource all of the add ons, such as mail, logging etc.  Best case scenario, write all your infrastructure as code, and be able to deploy to N number of clouds, or even bare metal, either way, I hope can learn how to produce a screencast quickly enough to get this damn thing launched.",1369598341

In quite a few cases, human beings selected plants so that they were loss toxic and more bearable to eat in larger doses.

But I've been using unittest long enough that I know how to get what I want from it, so I haven't bothered to learn nose.<p>2) I don't know about Py3 issues like that.<p>3.1) I am not much of a believer about ""SRP"". What's your public/published API? Is it useful? It is understandable? Does your exposed module structure give a domain view or an internal organizational view that might change after refactoring. Behind the scenes you're more free to design as you wish.<p>3.2) In a small package like this, I would have everything in a single file.<p>4) I don't like the ""import re"" and other class attributes in ClippingsIterator. I prefer them as global variables, and prefix with a ""_"" as a hint that they aren't meant as part of the API. I believe this preference is the standard consensus.<p>5) don't know.<p>6) I'm not knowledgeable enough to judge, but it looks fine to me.<p>Minor points:<p><pre><code>    for c in clippings:

</code></pre>
""(clipping['book'],clipping['author'])"" should have a space after the comma.<p>In general it's best to have things like ""import os"" done once, at the top of the module. ""os"" is a builtin, is always present, and the ""import os"" has almost no overhead.<p>The jinja2 import is a bit more special. Do you want the code to work even if jinja2 isn't installed? In which case, what you have is good. I would add a comment, on the same line as ""from jinja2 import ..."", saying ""available from <url>"". This gives an additional clue should a failure occur.<p>But if your code doesn't make sense without jinja2 then I would put the import at the top of the module, to occur at import time. This is more like what people expect, so would be easier to diagnose should a failure occur.<p>It doesn't look like ""import_clippings"" is part of the exposed API, since it takes no parameters and always sets an instance variable that looks like it should only be set once. In that case, prefix it with a ""_"" to indicate that it shouldn't be called directly.<p>I would write ClippingsIterator() as a function rather than a class, in this rough form:<p><pre><code>    def read_clippings(source):
        detected_encoding = _detect_encoding(source)

They afford experimentation, provide instant feedback, and need little to no labelling.<p>Thats how I think programming ought to be, at least at a beginner level.

If there weren't busses, all the passengers would be driving their cars to work.<p>There is no reasonable public transportation from the areas of San Francisco where people live and Google's campus in Mountain View.  The reality is that Caltrain mostly goes through residential areas, so any company that wants a public-transportation-friendly location is kind of out of luck without being located in the city.  And of course, 4th and King is not very close to where most people in San Francisco live.<p>I've timed out how long it would take to commute from downtown San Francisco to Google's campus using only public transportation.  It's on the order of 2 hours, and only if you go during rush hour and get the Caltrain shuttle and the Baby Bullet train.  Outside of rush hour, it takes over 3 hours.  Nobody is going to do a 6 hour daily commute; that's insane.<p>(I've also done the reverse commute -- living in Santa Clara and commuting to Google SFO.  By gBus it only takes an hour and a half, since there is a bus from the apartment where I usually stay to the MTV campus, and then a bus from MTV to SFO.  If you want to take public transportation, you're out of luck: it's a $20 cab ride to the Santa Clara train station, and then the usual Caltrain + Muni ride to the office.)<p>So the busses aren't a sign of privilege and elitism and class and exuberant riches and gentrification or whatever ""bad"" buzz words the leaders of Occupy Wall Street think they are.  They're a way of cutting the emissions (and stress) of Googlers' commutes and a way of making practical something many people want: to live in the city but work in the suburbs.<p>It's true that the real fix would be to nuke the entire San Francisco Bay Area and rebuild it to be less car-centric, but that's not going to happen.  (Especially in California, where they envy the timeliness of projects like the Second Avenue Subway and the Big Dig.)  You can't undo 100 years of intentional discrimination against non-car-owners overnight.

The prolonged finessing of architectural details and even paint color can delay and kill many projects.

In this case, on the low end, the ""15 or less"" bucket currently has 17 points, the ""15-30"" bucket has 57, so that's OK. On the high end, ""121-150"" has 86 points, ""150+"" has 130, making it the 3rd largest bucket. Normally, you want the highest and lowest buckets to hold only the outliers, and not a significant fraction of the responses.<p>Another way to look at it is that the median currently lies in the ""71-90"" bucket, so there are 4 buckets below the median, but only 3 above.<p>For that matter, the buckets should probably have all been the same width. The lower buckets are 15 to 20 dollars wide. The higher buckets are 30 dollars wide, and as a result contain more responses.<p>Of course, it's hard to know how the buckets should be distributed until you have some data!<p>Incidentally, buckets should be non-overlapping, so ""15 or less"" should have been ""less than 15"", and ""150+"" should have been ""151+"".",1369595471

If you could split it up so you could spend 2 days a week communicating and 3 days a week typing in code, you wouldn't need to come to work 3 days a week.  But the reality is that the communication can't be segmented or front-loaded -- you need to chat with your colleague next to you for a minute every 10 minutes or something like that.  If you're both working in different locations, the 30 seconds of overhead becomes an hour meeting and then you either spend 59 minutes figuring out something yourself, or you spend all your time in meetings.  Either way, you're not being very productive.<p>The only way to avoid the communication overhead is to have one person working on each component.  But since coordinating the components involves communication, you can only have one component.  So sitting alone typing away is fine if you're working on a one person project, but if you want to do something bigger, it pays to have everyone sitting together with a few hours overlapping.

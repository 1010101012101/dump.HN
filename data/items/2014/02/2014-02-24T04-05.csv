If you have a new fundamental assumption, throw away your old code and rewrite it from scratch. Incremental patching and modifying seems easier at first, and is the normal course of things in software development, but ends up being much harder and producing bulkier, markedly inferior code in the long run, as we’ll see when we discuss the net code for QuakeWorld. It may seem safer to modify working code, but the nastiest bugs arise from unexpected side effects and incorrect assumptions, which almost always arise in patched-over code, not in code designed from the ground up. Do the hard work up front to make your code simple, elegant, great—and just plain right—and it’ll pay off many times over in the long run.&quot;",1393217253

7289119,comment,7288884,7288884,11,0,einhverfr,,,"Hmmm... This article strikes me as relatively missing a few things.<p>Perl 5 is a mature language.  There is a lot of effort at building Perl 6, but at this point it doesn&#x27;t really look like Perl 6 will be a successor to Perl 5 (the metaphor now is &quot;little sister&quot;).  It&#x27;s so different, it is like learning a new language.<p>Now, I do a lot of programming in Perl.  I have done some scripting in Ruby, Python, PHP, and more, but I always come back to Perl because the language is remarkably flexible.  (Rebol is probably the second I frequently come back to, and Red looks promising.)<p>Predicting the demise of Perl is relatively premature.  I don&#x27;t think we will ever see Perl 6 supplant Perl 5.  Rather these will become different languages (with a relationship similar to that of C vs C++).<p>Now you can write crap code in any language, and I just love how Python gives invisible characters semantic meaning (not), a problem that is likely to get worse as the number of whitespace characters continues to proliferate (not just plain spaces and tabs, but non-breaking spaces vs regular spaces....).<p>What perl has lost is the &quot;let&#x27;s quickly throw together an app&quot; crowd.  That crowd has gone sometimes to Python, sometimes to Ruby, and sometimes to Lua.  From where I stand, good riddance.  This is what gave Perl a bad reputation in the past.<p>To plug my own projects, right now I am working on a framework for delegating Perl object methods to PostgreSQL stored procedures.[1]   At some point I may port the work to PHP and Python, but currently Perl is where this is really going for me.  The thing is that such work is not applicable to the &quot;throw together an app using an ORM or NoSQL fast&quot; crowd, but it allows for some very sophisticated, powerful, and robust business tool development.<p>Additionally I have to plug <a href=""http://cpantesters.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cpantesters.org</a>.

Similar to your former superior, I&#x27;m also coming out of a liberal arts background. I just want to make it clear that someone like me, despite their background, agrees with you that the person you were reporting to was foolish to even bother A/B testing such minor elements at 100 hits/day.<p>Sadly, many foolish &quot;SEOs&quot;/&quot;digital marketers&quot;/&quot;growth hackers&quot; have this same mentality that such subtle changes--despite low traffic--still offer meaningful information to digest and further analyze. But hey, they gotta keep their boss/clients on-board for the thrill and payment, right? For everyone out there, remember that often outside the highest echelon of traffic levels, this testing is often performed by marketers with BAs in business administration, marketing, or liberal arts degrees like me. They are often not the statisticians referenced in this document. And sadly they may likely be people unlike me, unwilling to stretch out into a programming languages for data analysis and may have never cracked open a book on statistics. But frankly they have other things to worry about--like staying in your budget and overall digital branding and marketing strategy. Their budget and time is likely better applied outside of A/B testing.<p>If you have a mathematics background, reach out to your marketing department. If you consider yourself a math-wiz, reach out to the &quot;growth hacker&quot; or &quot;SEO&quot; a few feet away. They deal with the stuff you don&#x27;t want to deal with. You deal with the stuff they don&#x27;t want to deal with. Help each other out and engage in a conversation to better help your business. At least your superiors would appreciate it.<p>Personally, when it comes to landing pages, I test much more dramatic shifts--significant changes to the entire design or to the header imagery along with call-to-action. I don&#x27;t buy into the testing of slight adjustments to things like font size or button color (and especially when there is such so low volume). That said, I&#x27;ve never worked with hundreds of thousands of visitors per month on a site, where anyone would imagine smaller changes for testing can make a bit more sense to look into.<p>gkoberger, I&#x27;m sorry you hated your first webdev internship.

Then &quot;local&quot; was added which effectively pushes the current value on the some stack and retrieves that value on the way back, then later &quot;my&quot; was added to actually give local variables.<p>Similarly all the crazy special variables @_,$_, $a, $b, $&, $&#x27;, $+, @+, @- %-, $^R, $., $/, $|, $\\, $&quot;, $; etc etc etc.  I&#x27;m sure someone out there really loves that stuff but to many it&#x27;s one giant hack, disliked for similar reasons to PHP&#x27;s disorganization.<p>On top of that it died at version 5 because version 6 never came out.<p>For web stuff, PHP at least provided a huge speed boost (over CGI, the typical way Perl was used) PHP also supported the whole shared host model much better than Perl/CGI. I&#x27;m not saying I like PHP. PHP&#x27;s templating roots also made it more approachable by beginners. I&#x27;m only pointing out why for some use cases PHP killed Perl.<p>On the other side Python also killed Perl. Python seems like far less of a hack upon hack design. Python also has a comparable number of libraries, many builtin making it usually as easy to bang something out as Perl was.",1393215270

Its strengths were CPAN & community, ubiquity and top-notch text processing. Its acquired taste was very elegant expressiveness once you grokked the grammar.<p>Then all the Perl leadership focussed on the black hole of Perl 6 which was solving a problem no one had but CS linguists. So Perl users like me felt there was no future in Perl. Perl 6 would have to be relearned for no tangible benefit so why not learn something new with a growing rather than stagnant/declining ecosystem? No one was forced to leave, but like a trap door, as soon as a Perl programmer learned something new, they were only going to continue to decrease their use of Perl.<p>The rise of Python and Ruby (and Ruby on Rails especially) and even PHP, were grave wounds to the health of Perl, but Perl 6 was the self-cutting that bled the community beyond the point of self-repair.",1393215173

Thanks!<p>In seriousness, though, this is not a very informative article. It essentially boils down to &quot;I learned a little Perl after college, but didn&#x27;t like the syntax. Then I went to grad school and found that everyone there was using Python, so I switched to that instead. Also, where&#x27;s Perl 6 amirite lol.&quot;<p>Which is fine, as far as it goes, but it tells you more about the author&#x27;s career path than it does about either language. And by doing so, it leaves out important elements of the story. Writing an article about &quot;the fall of Perl&quot; that only incidentally mentions PHP, for instance, is a <i>big</i> omission. Insofar as Perl has fallen, what it fell from is the position of leading language for building Web applications. PHP is what pushed it out of that position, not Python or Ruby. If you want to write an article about the fall of Perl you have to explain how that happened and why, but this article attempts neither.<p>I think the root of the problem is that the author is incorrectly generalizing from his own experiences. He mentions working in scientific computing these days; if you work in that field, and entered the workforce within the last decade, I can totally understand how it might look like The Story Of Programming Languages goes &quot;once there was Perl, now there is Python, The End.&quot; But step outside that niche or that time window, and things look very different.",1393215076

Living the highlife is out - no pubs for you.  Your only status is to (1) clean the flat for the people who let you stay there and (2) look for jobs.  This should be a full-time occupation until you find a job - any job.  Your ability to continue to sponge off someone else is tied to how they feel when they get home tired and find you sitting on their couch, coupled with how quickly you can find employment and vacate said couch.<p>Locking in a well-paying job before you get there is like saying you should find a good looking girlfriend before you start university.  It&#x27;s not going to happen unless you are very established somewhere already and get a transfer, or are internet famous for something.  Or you are going to get sold a pup and end up locked into a crappy job in a crappy part of town.<p>I found my first job within 10 days of landing, worked that for a couple of months, asked to be paid after 1 week and then spent the entire cash amount on a deposit for a short-term one-room flat, which took all my money so I ate pot-noodles for a week.  Stayed there for 4 weeks until I amassed enough cash for a proper flat.  By that time I found two other people who wanted to share and the three of us rented a decent place for a decent price.  After that it was better jobs, more fun and a great time.  I passed it on by helping other people out with time on the couch, coupled with strict rules on what goes on.<p>In case you think that was a fluke, I repeated the same thing about 4 years later, only this time it took 8 weeks to find a job because the economy was more strained.  I had (marginally) more savings this time but it was more tense.<p>The hack for housing in London is finding a borough with low council taxes with the lowest transport zone you can afford, and if you have an established job, one which offers a short commute.  And don&#x27;t blow all your weeks surplus on a big friday night out including an expensive cab ride home.<p>The only trick is being hungry for success in a city that doesn&#x27;t seem to want to give it to you unless you fight for it.",1393214837

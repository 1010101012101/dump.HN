It did require the interviewer have tech/code skills to discuss problems but it proved much better than giving people abitrary assignments from a code bank and getting a HR person to go through a checklist of known solutions.<p>It also sorted the people who actually enjoyed what they were doing from those simply looking for a paycheck.",1211367498

195892,comment,195856,195856,0,0,kingnothing,,,"Well, I just wrote a bunch of detailed thoughts and accidently lost them all, so here it is again.<p>1. The navigation links (all, entertainment, etc) should be the same width as the main content of the site to give it a cleaner look.<p>2. The site doesn't seem to work at a width of less than 1024 pixels, although I was only resizing the window so that number might be a bit off. I didn't get a horizontal scroll bar in either Firefox 3 or Opera 9.5.<p>3. What is the difference between the default selection, ""recently popular rivals"" on the left, and ""featured rivals"" on the right? Why isn't the ""featured rivals"" section just another nav link with the rest of the rivalry links on the top bar?<p>4. I think the ""Sports"" section should be more prominently displayed towards the left of the nav links as sports is a decidedly hot topic for rivalries. On that note, you might want to add subsections for various sports such as College Football, Soccer, Baseball, etc. I'm not sure if tags are the right answer, but I'm sure you'll think of something if you go that route. If you end up doing that, you might want to consider looking at the incoming IP address's country of origin in order to have it say ""soccer"" for America and ""football"" for the rest of the world, and ""football"" for America and ""American football"" for everyone else, although I'm definitely offtopic now.",1211366901

195888,comment,195188,195273,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"I was going to post a similar comment, until I read Gordon's paper, which is entitled (wait for it) ""A Faster Scrabble Move Generation Algorithm"".  In other words, this wasn't a case of Eric finding a cool data structure and then choosing Scrabble as a way to play with it-- if it was research, it was Scrabble research.<p>This is not to take away from Eric in any way-- props to him for both the coding he's done, and the article.  And, it wouldn't surprise me at all to find that his knowledge of DAGs, DAWGs and GADDADs was helpful later on in SourceGear.<p>But this particular case looks more ""recreation"" than ""research"" to me.",1211366719

195880,comment,195423,195874,0,0,1gor,,,">Python's author, Guido Van Rossum, also made some boneheaded technical blunders early on â€” none quite as extravagant as Larry's blunders, but a few were real doozies nonetheless. For instance, Python originally had no lexical scoping. But it didn't have dynamic scoping either, and dynamic scoping may have its share of problems, but it at least sort of works. Python had NOTHING except for global and local (function) scope, so even though it had a ""real"" OO system, classes couldn't even access their own damned instance variables. You have to pass a ""self"" parameter to EVERY instance method and then get to your instance data by accessing it through self. So everything in Python is self, selfself, selfselfself, selfSELFselfSELF__SELF__, and it drives you frigging nuts, even if you don't mind the whitespace thing.<p><a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/tour-de-babel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/tour-de-babel</a>",1211365319

195873,comment,195298,195298,0,0,antirez,,,"What's strange about it? Facebook, twitter, ...., don't solve any tangible problem: they are generic social networks that are more subject to fashion than intrinsic value, because people to communicate and get in touch need very little: ability to send message, profiles with photos, and so on.<p>This is why I never understood the facebook buzz around tech people, for example here in YC news: it does not care. I don't want to state that only things like a search engine or a bug tracking system can care. Flickr cares a lot, changed the way people put photos online, is a social community in some way but driven by a common interest: it as a side effect it's a database of images.<p>The same like delicious, social bookmarking cares: it is a place where you can really find interesting resources, and it is useful for individuals. It is also one of the best applications for tags that is a very important semantic concept.<p>Instead generic social networks will came and go away one after the other, like Pubs do: they are mostly about fashion.",1211364546

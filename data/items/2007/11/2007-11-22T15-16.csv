The next class of people graduating from college will have had Facebook throughout their entire tenure. It's likely that Facebook will try to evolve to follow them into their professional lives.<p>I also agree about having different kinds of friends. However, it would be pretty simple to categorize friends as colleagues, acquaintances, etc. It might insult people in the beginning, but if it was part of the system, it would become second-nature.<p>Apps that are viral for the sake of virility are a waste of time. They might be fun for awhile, and they might make their creators a little bit of cash, but Vampires and Werewolves will never have a sustainable business model.

The tie-in is not as string as Facebook and how many of us actually had a myspace page we updated regularly when Myspace was big?

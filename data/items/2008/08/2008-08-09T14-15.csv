He lost me right off the bat. Maybe I just don't use strange libraries, but getting things working across the Linuxes has never been a major problem for me, apart from debian/ubuntu's broken menu system, and this app sure won't fix that. And it's certainly not the available libraries that cause problems. The things that bite me are the wider unixes: Sparcs have numlock as mod3 instead of mod2, BSDs don't use GNU make by default, Apples have one mouse button, cygwin can't store much on the stack, etc. And honestly, compatibility issues are maybe 1% of the bugs I fix. This is no silver bullet.<p>But if I had to say something about the disparity of Linuxes, it would be all the different compiler versions and flags that people use.",1218292285

271697,comment,270809,271337,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's always true in any field where success is relative, and one's success is based on being ""better"" than others. For example in rowing, if you're on the same training program as everyone else then your chance of winning is basically flip-a-coin. Similarly, if you paint in the same style as others then your chances of being recognized as the best painter are basically flip-a-coin as well. Math, however, is different because you work at uncovering the properties of mathematical objects whatever they might be (so success is absolute), and you don't get credit for doing stuff that's already been done. Because of this everyone can do math the same way and still win, because how much stuff you discover is a function of you and what you're working on and not your methods.<p>If I had to come up with a general law on the spot, I'd say that the pressure to create new methodology is directly proportional to the similarity of recent winning outcomes in the past. I haven't fully tried to break this yet, but I'm guessing I'm pretty close to having found a natural law since it is consistent with evolution running in S-Curves.",1218292119

I was just reading your whole discussion with Paul Graham in another thread. Fancy seeing you here.<p>EDIT 2: The opposite side of this coin is something that I love about Apple's advertising.

It's allowing me to understand my application a bit better and proving to be a great learning point for me.<p>In generality, I can only see an API introduced early as a major advantage. It can give you a direction for your design and future development. Oh, yeah, and the purpose of the API .. it will allow people to interact with your application in ways you possibly didn't imagine; there'll always be someone out there who would be interested in playing about with it!<p>Just my $0.02.

Understand Paul Grice's Conversational Maxim's: <a href=""http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html</a> (Understand that they are, as proffered by Grice, descriptive, partly anthropological heuristics for analysis of certain ways of talking, or faon de parler; but they _may_ also be developed as normative principles which may be used to constructively guide all talk exchanges.)<p>Fig. 1, Grice's Maxims:<p> The maxim of quantity, where one tries to be as informative as one possibly can, and gives as much information as is needed, and no more.<p>The maxim of quality, where one tries to be truthful, and does not give information that is false or that is not supported by evidence.<p>The maxim of relation, where one tries to be relevant, and says things that are pertinent to the discussion.<p>The maxim of manner, when one tries to be as clear, as brief, and as orderly as one can in what one says, and where one avoids obscurity and ambiguity.<p>Fig. 2, an excerpt from J. Lynch:<p> ##Prepositions.<p>Prepositions are usually little words that indicate direction, position, location, and so forth. Some examples: to, with, from, at, in, near, by, beside, and above.<p>A quick-and-dirty rule of thumb: you can usually recognize a preposition by putting it before the word he. If your ear tells you he should be him, the word might be a preposition. Thus to plus he becomes to him, so to is a preposition. (This doesn't help with verbs of action; show + he becomes show him. Still, it might help in some doubtful cases.)<p>##Prepositions at the End.<p>Along with split infinitives, a favorite bugbear of the traditionalists. Whatever the merit of the rule  and both historically and logically, there's not much  there's a substantial body of opinion against end-of-sentence prepositions; if you want to keep the crusty old-timers happy, try to avoid ending written sentences (and clauses) with prepositions, such as to, with, from, at, and in. Instead of writing The topics we want to write on, where the preposition on ends the clause, consider The topics on which we want to write. Prepositions should usually go before (pre-position) the words they modify.<p>On the other hand  and it's a big other hand  old-timers shouldn't always dictate your writing, and you don't deserve your writing license if you elevate this rough guideline into a superstition. Don't let it make your writing clumsy or obscure; if a sentence is more graceful with a final preposition, let it stand. For instance, He gave the public what it longed for is clear and idiomatic, even though it ends with a preposition; He gave the public that for which it longed avoids the problem but doesn't look like English. A sentence becomes unnecessarily obscure when it's filled with from whoms and with whiches. According to a widely circulated (and often mutated) story, Winston Churchill, reprimanded for ending a sentence with a preposition, put it best: This is the sort of thing up with which I will not put. [Revised 12 Jan. 2007.] <p>Write and talk appropriate to your audience. Your audience in some cases might be your self. Determine what criteria you demand for a successful ""talk exchange"" such that shared knowledge may be produced, rather than actionable results (we should ignore implementation details).",1337201865

There are lots of transactional benchmarks, but they're often flawed in some annoying way and don't serve well as a baseline as TPC-C.<p>That said, TPC-C is horribly out-of-date. For example, you have to simulate human data entry time within transactions. How many systems have that problem today? It also only ever adds data, so if you run it fast enough, you have a petabyte problem, and most OLTP isn't a petabyte problem.<p>As for the second point, those clusters are clusters in name only. They use fancy and expensive interconnects and caches that effectively give them shared memory. Also, they won't tolerate failure of any individual component well.

3983903,comment,3982354,3983323,47,0,madhadron,,,"Eschewing trailing prepositions is a rule improperly inherited from Latin. It does not apply to Germanic tongues where prepositions are necessary to disambiguate verbs. For example, to ask about, to ask of, to ask to, and to ask in are very quite distinct. In Latin, the default position of the verb is the end of the sentence. Latin word order isn't fixed like English, so the ordering of words is a form of emphasis, and placing something in the final position, after the verb, is one of the strongest emphases possible. Putting a preposition in that position would be like someone screaming ""WITH! WITH!"" on a soapbox on the street corner.<p>It's a useful rule though: an English grammar book that proscribes trailing prepositions is one you needn't spend any more time with. Just put it down and forget that it exists.<p>Like so many other rules, it results from Latin-steeped scholars of the 19th century who were uncomfortable with the flexibility of their native tongue, and attempted to hem it round. It's understandable. These men knew they could use the full scope of expression of Latin. About the only person who's ever pushed English hard enough to make it creak was James Joyce.<p>Amusing aside: you can transform transitive verbs into nouns in English directly (to request, a request). You can't similarly transform intransitive verbs because they require a preposition. In German, you would say a for-ask or an of-ask, but we don't accept that in English. Verbs with both forms are an interesting grey area, such as to dig vs to dig for.",1337200625

3983770,comment,3982251,3982678,5,0,ghshephard,,,"First, my perspective is that IPv6, to some degree, abandons 15+ years of VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masks) - so, at a glance, without referring to a subnet mask, you can identify what position of the address is a network, and which portion is the host element.  There is a 64 bit network and 64 bit host field.<p>Second, The network portion for most enterprises is going to be a 48 bit super net (which network admins will memorize within a few days of working within a particularly company) followed by a 16 bit network portion.   So, in the above example, the 48 bit super net is 2001:1868:209 and the network portion is FFFD.<p>So - now, when I see an IPv6 address, my eye automatically scans the network portion, much, much more quickly than I did in the IPv4 world, where we had 30 or 40 IPv4 networks, many of them with their own strange /30, /28/ /26 /25, etc.. net masks.  I've been doing this for 16 years, and I still can't transparently do the math in my head for all variants of IPv4 - and even 2-3 seconds of translating /27 into 5 bits into 32 addresses into boundaries of 0,32,64,96,128,etc... can break your concentration.  That problem no longer exists with IPv6.  It's a 48 bit super net + 16 bit network for most enterprises.<p>Now, for those who aren't using the privacy elements, you also have advantage of embedding the MAC address in the address, so, for those of us who are OUI geeks, we can also identify the equipment in the address so (it's the first 24 bits of the host portion, with a bit of bit twiddling the in 7bit Local/Global spot) - and, we can also see whether proper EUI-64 expansion has taken place (in the above example, it hasn't - the proper EUI-64 expansion would be 0213:50FF:FE12:3456)<p>So - at a glance, I see the network, sub network, and hardware, skim over the FF:FE filler, and, the actual address - 12:3456 is simple to remember.<p>Finally - if you have a lot of hosts you are trying to put on a single network, you don't have to play games.  We routinely put 25,000 devices on a single routed link, and we aren't concerned about rolling out 2,000 of those 25K device routed links for a particular instance.   And we can (and have) rolled out a hundred instances of such configurations, with no overlap in addressing between any of them.   Try that without gymnastics in the IPv4 world.  In IPv6 it just follows the simple rules of 48 bit supernet + 16 bit network + 64 bit host field.<p>It takes a couple years (or at least it took me a couple years) - but once the brain's rewired - the additional structure is in _some way_, easier to understand and remember -but obviously this is all within a particular hardware and enterprise context.  Clearly a Random 32 Bit IPv4 address is easier to memorize than a random 128 Bit IPv6 address.",1337198906

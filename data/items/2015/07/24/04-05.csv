Also note that I presented options as game theoretic decisions - I personally have ethical considerations, but those do not color the very obvious career differences for so-called &quot;whitehats&quot; and &quot;blackhats&quot; (terms which I do not enjoy but which are good enough for a discussion that doesn&#x27;t require so much nuance).",1437713979

Classes and instances of classes are distinct (though the semantics aren&#x27;t equivalent, a class is described as an instance too, but of a metaclass, not of its parent classes). Both can only inherit from classes. Once you instantiate an instance, your inheritance is terminated.<p>I can derive any object from any other object in Javascript. An object can be treated as a class, a metaclass, or an instance. There is no language difference. That isn&#x27;t just syntax, that is a deep part of the implementation and semantics.<p>Both languages are Turing complete, so of course one can build a system that does prototypal inheritance in Python, in fact it is rather simple, given Python&#x27;s powerful delegation system. Just as you can create classes in Javascript. But there is a difference.<p>If you disagree, it may be worth you giving a definition of what you think prototypal inheritance is, as distinct from class-based inheritance.<p>> perhaps you can take your FooClass and run it through a function, permuting it as desired, but then, you would still need to do that at every base-class&#x27;s definition site<p>You don&#x27;t have FooClass in Javascript in the same sense.

Thus the restriction of the two-level ontology doesn&#x27;t raise its head.<p>> follow the prototype chain, follow the MRO<p>This is the same for any class-based language. There is a delegation chain that goes from instance -> class -> parent class, etc.<p>So again, what do you think would make something prototypal? Do you think it is a meaningless term? Or just something fashionable to make Javascript sound important?<p>This isn&#x27;t bashing Python, you can do plenty of stuff in python. But it does have a different model of object orientation to Javascript. Fortunately Python is flexible enough to subvert that if you need to. But that&#x27;s not what the terms mean.

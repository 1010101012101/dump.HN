3467362,comment,3467287,3467287,4,0,toyg,,,"I hope you are not trolling.<p>The difference between REST and SOAP is how you expose your api via HTTP; with a RESTful approach, you should expose clean URLs that will be accessed via http methods expressing their original meaning (i.e. GET will only fetch a resource, not trigger side-effects; creation operations will use POST; etc etc). This usually results in simple interfaces that can be accessed directly with basic http libraries and don't necessarily rely on XML. The point of REST is that any http client will be able to access your API; wrapping libraries like the one you provide are completely optional.<p>Developers prefer REST for this reason: it's much easier than SOAP (where you invariably have to rely on wrapping libraries you don't understand) and doesn't introduce any dependency on libraries. If you intend on forcing customers to use a wrapping library anyway, then it doesn't really matter what you choose, because you're completely hiding the http layer anyway. Doing it ""the REST way"" would mean you just document your http interfaces and make the wrapper completely optional, while maintaining simplicity.",1326642556

3467315,comment,3466892,3466892,11,0,jgrahamc,,,"My stab at how the bullet measures its own rotation:<p>Suppose the bullet leaves the muzzle rotating at 300,000 RPM (quite reasonable for a rifle).  That is 5kHz.  It's easily within the capabilities of a Hall Effect sensor to measure a 5kHz rotation and so I'd make the very centre of the bullet contain a free rotating magnet.  The rifle itself sets the magnet spinning at some known rate opposite to the rifling.  When the bullet leaves the rifle it is able to measure the time between detections of the magnet and given the known rifling, the known magnet rotation speed it would be able to calculate rotations.<p>Alternatively, the inner magnet could be spinning in the same direction as the rifling but faster and detect complete rotations of the bullet. Either way I think Hall Effect + spinning magnet at bullet core would work.<p>Also, 5kHz is well within the operating range of a micro controller so this wouldn't need much computer power.  Lastly the article says that the weapon is accurate at 500m and that the shrapnel kills everyone within a few meters.  Also says that the soldier estimates the target distance.<p>That sounds like there's plenty of room for the measurement to be not too accurate.  Suppose 'several meters' is 5 then you can get away with an error of 1% or so.",1326641312

3467287,story,,,7,14,faxman,"Ask HN: SOAP vs REST - help me understand",,"My company has been offering a SOAP-based API since around 2002.  We recently ran a survey on our site in which a full 25% of visiting developers said that SOAP is a show-stopper for them and that they would prefer REST, even though we provide full code samples in various languages for our SOAP interface.<p>Ever mindful of our clients' wishes, we've begun designing a REST interface.  We've been trying to adopt the best practices of API providers out there, and we're planning to provide client libraries for the most popular languages as well.<p>This will take us a good few months, designing objects and operations, implementing the service, creating code samples, etc.  At the end of this process, a PHP developer, for example, will be able to send a fax through the REST API by using this code:<p><pre><code>       <?php\n\n       require('Interfax.php');\n       $client = new InterfaxClient($username, $password, $faxnumber, $texttofax, $filetype);\n       $result = $client->SendFax;  \n       echo $result;\n\n       ?>\n</code></pre>\ninstead of this code:<p><pre><code>       <?php\n        \n       $client = new SoapClient(""http://ws.interfax.net/dfs.asmx?wsdl"");\n        \n       $params->Username  = $username;\n       $params->Password  = $password;\n       $params->FaxNumber = $faxnumber;\n       $params->Data      = $texttofax ;\n       $params->FileType  = $filetype;\n        \n       $result = $client->SendCharFax($params);\n        \n       echo $result->SendCharFaxResult;  \n       ?>\n</code></pre>\nwhich is, effectively, the same.  The complexity of interfacing to the API is hidden in a custom library instead of a SOAP library.  Which brings me to ask myself ""what's the point""?  Where does the advantage of having a REST interface come into play?",1326640585

You can't talk about anything with a straight perspective because, you know, <i>somebody might get offended</i>.<p>A 16 years old kid has died. That is a sad fact by itself. If she was the dumbest kid in Pakistan that wouldn't have made the fact less sad - only, you wouldn't have known it. If she was the poorest kid in Pakistan, same thing. Now, you know that <i>a lot</i> of 16 years old kids die in Pakistan? Most of them with family situations much worse than the one she was in? Do you feel empathy for them? I bet so. That's a good thing, a human thing to feel.<p>Now, as a thought experiment, let's say she wasn't a Pakistani little girl. Let's say she was a 16 years old boy coming from a rich US family. Even fat and greasy, to add to the image. Let's also add that this one didn't die - he's well off in his NY mansion eating Snickers all day. What would you have thought of the article? ""16 years old kid from NY loves messing around with .NET"". Wouldn't you have said: <i>who cares</i>? And rightly so?<p>Empathy drains perspective. Feeling empathy is the noblest thing in the world. At the same time, it doesn't mean that it should suspend your ability to evaluate situations.

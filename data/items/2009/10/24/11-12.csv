As the author says:<p><i>It's only three pages long, and it paints a fascinating picture of both Gödel, who is exactly the sort of obsessive geek that you always imagined he was, and of Einstein, who had a cruel streak that he was careful not to show to the public.</i>",1256385318

I'm not a lawyer, but I can see both sides to this.<p>The whole purpose of a trademark is to protect your brand from anything that could be construed as ""confusingly similar"". Spark and Sparc sound the same and are nearly identical in spelling, and they are both involved in the tech industry.<p>Whomever made the decision to send a C&D wasn't completely out of line in their reasoning. (Especially since it does not cost a whole lot to send a C&D.  It will cost a lot more to take it to court, which I expect will be a factor in SparkFun's decision making process.)<p>That said, saying the two similar names are in the ""tech industry"" may not be sufficient justification for the trademark dispute any longer.  The industry has so much breadth nowadays and there are so many businesses involved, as long as SparkFun can prove that there is enough differentiation between what they do and what Sparc does they can probably get around it (with some legal tapdancing).<p>This would probably not be an issue if SparkFun sold handmade chocolate candies :-)",1256384285

Go figure).<p>I guess the page is intended to render the distance between the proton and the electron rather than the size relationship between the two.<p>On the other hand, even that is somewhat dubious. Electrons aren't located in a single place, they can be anywhere within a certain area, according to their probability density function - including right in the middle of the proton, though the probability of that is low.",1256384273

900363,comment,900086,900086,0,0,ramanujan,,,"Statistically illiterate article full of wishful thinking. Let me count the ways.<p>1. Most important: it is highly likely that elite university graduates are <i>enriched over background frequency</i> among tech startups, and furthermore that the degree of enrichment increases with financial success. Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, VMWare, etc. were all founded by people admitted/affiliated with Stanford or Harvard.<p>At least one person quoted gets the statistical fallacy here of this, but Wadhwa quotes it without understanding how it demolishes his argument:<p>> He notes that IITs only graduate 5,000 of India's 176,000 engineers every year, and that based on the number of companies started by its graduates, they were five times more likely than others to start tech companies.<p>2. Elite university grads are elite because they are the best in the world at hard science. Obviously they are more likely to understand stuff like restriction enzymes, operating systems, and machine learning than your average Directional University grad.<p>3. I <i>HIGHLY</i> doubt that UW is producing more ""blue chip CEOs and university professors"" than Stanford and MIT. UW-Madison <i>does</i> have a very good biology PhD program but this claim just does not pass the smell test.<p>4. Note also that ""blue chip"" is considered a compliment in certain parts of the article (""blue chip university professor""). This is a common self-contradictory refrain I've heard among critics of elitism. ""Oh yeah? Well it doesn't matter if I didn't get into your fancy school, because I work at Google now."" In other words, they're not attacking the idea of elitism or the validity of a name as a signaling mechanism. They're contesting the much more limited point of whether undergrad pedigree alone is the signal. Of course it is not and this is a straw man.<p>5. Lastly, I guarantee that someone has recently asked Wadhwa to name ""his school"". It is Harvard, as he is a fellow at Harvard. Was he an undergrad, grad, or faculty there? Then he's a Harvard man. Obviously he recognizes that ""elite colleges"" are marks of quality or he wouldn't include it as the first thing in his bio.",1256383698

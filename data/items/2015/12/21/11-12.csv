The hard sciences have managed to avoid the problems of philosophy for the last few centuries, but are increasingly running into fundamental methodological limitations. If, following Hume, induction is unreliable, how can we ever know our scientific theories are valid?<p>Ayn Rand developed a novel epistemology and theory of concepts to deal with these issues, but she&#x27;s almost universally slammed in academia for her political views.<p>All I can suggest is to read both her and her critics and make up your own mind. (But do read her own words, not just what her critics say about her - the book I mentioned above is a good starting point).",1450699172

10770661,comment,10768391,10768599,0,0,elorant,,,"<i>Nobody can figure out a way to test string theory.</i><p>Sure they can. Build a particle accelerator with one million times the power of LHC. Not knowing and not having the technology are two different things.<p>Fifty years ago nobody knew how to test the Higgs boson theory either. That didn’t stop them from moving on and when the technology permitted it run the tests and solidify the hypothesis. String theory didn’t just popped out of the heads of physicists who had nothing better to do with their time. Parts of string theory are already tested, the discovery of the new particle that was semi announced last week at LHC was predicted by a model of string theory. That’s how science progresses, with little steps. So don’t get pessimistic, scientists have done huge progress in the last hundred years or so.<p>Lastly, let’s not forget how little funding science gets these days and how many different areas they have to cover. It’s not just physics, you have cosmology, space exploration, biology, energy, just to name a few.<p>It’s not science’s job to answer philosophical questions. If for example philosophers feel powerless because of the multiverse theory we should stop theorizing it? If it turns out that life and everything we know is just the result of a mere stroke of luck, one universe with the proper conditions popping out from a variety of trillions, what should science do about it?<p><i>All those smart people hate to face the fact that what they&#x27;re doing may be total bullshit.</i><p>It’s funny saying something like that in Hacker News. Everything each and every one of us does has the potential to turn out as total bullshit. Every single day we write code that turns to be total garbage. And yet we’re doing it. You should watch the “Particle Fever” documentary. There you’ll see the reactions of physicists who favor supersymmetry in the possibility that it proves wrong. Everyone is devastated but they accept it. It’s part of the job. You make it sound like these guys are disillusioned. Scientists know perfectly well the consequences of following a wrong path in their career but they do it either way and we should be grateful to them, not despise them for it.",1450699042

Features of MEN2B can mimic Marfan syndrome and depression, and this is what happened in Lincoln and his mother: Owing to variant neuromuscular function associated with MEN2B, they were physically constituted to look sad, because their muscles (body and face) had low muscle tone as a result of MEN2B.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a chance in the world that Lincoln was depressed as President, but Sheik&#x27;s work has persuaded many people.

The average “subjective correctness” of the horoscopes is not something you would be interested in. You might throw it in somewhere in the paper you are writing, but more to show that ceiling or floor effects are not an issue (i.e. nearly everyone thinks the horoscopes are all either completely correct or completely false and as such you cannot really properly measure – like measuring the distance between New York and Los Angeles with a yard stick or the size of a molecule with a yard stick).<p>I dislike the outcome this experiment is measuring. I’m not an expert on horoscopes (and wouldn’t want to be one), but to me the primary purported function of horoscopes is to predict the future. As such people might not necessarily be able to say beforehand whether their own horoscope is more correct than that of someone else†. How should they know? But that is easily fixed: Just ask them to rank the horoscopes after the purported predicted time frame …<p>Altogether this seems like a solid setup to me, though. It would be fun to conduct this, but ultimately pointless. Astrology is just a too low hanging fruit.<p>(A potential issue might be people’s awareness of stereotypes associated with their astrological sign. I’m not sure how big a role those play of how important and consistent across different astrologers those are – as I said, not an expert – but if stereotypes associated with astrological signs are consistent and generally well known people might be able to identify the correct horoscope just based on the knowledge of those stereotypes, not any predictive power of the horoscopes.)<p>It was Feynman using the term cargo cult science. And he was not only talking about soft science, he was more generally talking about all of science. And it was not a general condemnation, it was about saying that “cargo cult science” is always a possibility and obviously an issue, but not that it is always an issue. Though I would definitely agree with you in saying that quantitative soft sciences suffer the most from cargo cult thinking.<p>It’s a paradox, really. “Soft science” is actually really hard. Measuring people and people’s behavior is a nightmare. There are so many variables, so many complex, ever-changing systems. We are at the limits of what we can achieve and our measuring instruments are extremely blunt and imprecise.<p>Because it’s so hard we are currently not even trying to solve many of the hard problems there. Because we just don’t know how. As such we limit ourselves to simple stuff and the people who are adept at doing the hard stuff (but not as hard as soft science, since that is so hard, no one knows how to properly do it) are doing things that are easier to nail down, with fewer variables – like physics.<p>And quantitative soft science limits itself by necessity to simple stuff. It simplifies without understanding the underlying complexity. And often slips into cargo cult thinking doing that …<p>—<p>† Though I actually think this is the real function of horoscopes: People have to be able to identify with them and think that they fit them when they are reading them. It’s entertainment. That’s why they are full of platitudes and not very specific.",1450696179

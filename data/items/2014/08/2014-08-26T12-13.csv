8226844,comment,8225569,8226552,3,0,Xylakant,,,">> although none are as destructive as alcohol.<p>> Really? Are you really saying that heroin, which is one of the most addictive drugs in the world, is not as destructive as alcohol? While there are more alcoholics than horse heads, that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s more people that drink alcohol as a whole. Are there any studies for the ratio of abusers/users for heroin and alcohol?<p>Your parent poster is right here. Heroin (and opiates in general) are pretty safe substances in pure form. That&#x27;s one of the reasons that opiates are still among the preferred potent pain killers in hospitals: Little side effects, extremely potent, a very big window between effective dose and overdose. If you&#x27;re in really bad pain, at least in germany, you&#x27;ll get a morphine drip.<p>The &quot;drug&quot; effects you see in documentaries about drug often are no effects of the drug itself, rather than the stuff that the dealers mix the drug with, the use of unclean needles (infections and stuff) and the conditions that the addicts live in. Overdoses are typically either on purpose or most of the time the result of extreme variations in the potency of the drug. There was (or still is) a medical trial that gave clean, controlled heroin to hard addicts in Hamburg, Germany and from what I read that trial was very successful: The people in the trial were basically able to function in a normal day live with a regular job. Obviously no driving, no handling heavy machinery, but otherwise a major step up from living on the street.",1409057973

8226817,comment,8222982,8222982,2,0,VLM,,,"Could also be phrased &quot;the rise of under-employment&quot; rather than loss of skill.  Hundreds of years ago my direct ancestors were making coo coo clocks in the black forest, and on paper that carpentry skillset is completely lost after a couple generations of job titles, although I am actually a modestly skilled wood butcher, I am beyond your average handyman or roofer or maybe even average rougher, but I am good enough to know I&#x27;m at least one step, maybe two, beneath the true masters of the craft.  I might be a higher skilled carpenter than some of my less competent ancestors, despite it merely being a hobby.<p>As a close to the heart analogy, everyone here knows that if you graduated with a BSCS and didn&#x27;t do the IT/accounting or the graphics arts/web design track then the student probably did the stereotypical academic track with all manner of highly skilled senior year classes like automata theory, compiler design, maybe some control theory (although thats more EE).  I did well in those classes and like many (most?) people I&#x27;m highly underemployed.  I would guess that well over half, maybe 90 percent, of my fellow students in automata class and compiler class are just doing CRUD web apps or mobile apps, which hardly require those skill levels / skill sets.<p>I&#x27;d be slightly interested in sociological commentary on societies where underemployment increases.  Does it always increase infinitely, or crash after awhile, or just not matter much?<p>A better proxy for carpentry skill level of a society might be the total sales of tools and supplies.  I think the total economic size of the &quot;at least somewhat skilled woodworker&quot; is larger today than in the olden days.<p>Another interesting aspect is expansion of titles.  Everyone in a skilled craft no matter if its programming or carpentry knows some are more equal that others, in carpentry no matter if you all have the same job title, or hobby name, some guys can barely be trusted with material handling and rough carcasses while other guys can be trusted to trim the finest kitchen cabinets, despite all having the same title.

And of course, I fully realize that what I&#x27;m writing below is based on generalizations that I&#x27;ve witnessed/experienced.<p>For example, here in Canada there&#x27;s very little risk tolerance, regardless of what people tell you. You see it in the ways companies raise funds, are valued, and even the execution points. Being &#x27;self-employed&#x27; can be a hindrance, especially in marketing. On the other side &#x27;Founding X company - building the overall business to over $YY in revenue&#x27; is a positive spin on the same result.<p>On the other hand, discussing a project-based approach looks VERY good. At that point you&#x27;re a consultant, rather than a contractor or freelancer. Here, that resonates better, in that people go &#x27;ah, well paid expert&#x27;. This in turn means that you can pivot the discussion around to project successes, the values you&#x27;ve learned working on multiple projects, etc.<p>But most importantly, don&#x27;t underestimate the value of the cover letter - which I used to believe no one reads. If you can explain your <i>passion</i> to join organization X (for some specific reason), then effectively you&#x27;re priming your resume reader.

That&#x27;s great. I found html2canvas to be really resource heavy when taking the snapshot, and there was no way to do it &#x27;automatically&#x27;. Why does that matter? When debugging, I want <i>history</i>.<p>My ideal bug-reporting tool would not only give user specs, stack traces and a screenshot, but a history of screenshots going back to an arbitrary length so I can figure out exactly what the user was doing that triggered that error. Trial and error could lead one to the correct sequence of screenshots but I&#x27;ve found one per 10s / 6 max (so 60s of history) to be a pretty good way to do it.<p>So if you know you want history, how do you get it? You can&#x27;t use html2canvas to just take snapshots the entire time the user is using the page (I&#x27;ve tried (work account on GitHub): <a href=""https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/pull/270"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/pull/270</a>). It&#x27;s far too slow, memory heavy, and if done asynchronously can create really strange render bugs if the user scrolls or mutates the DOM. Some of these issues can be fixed but it will forever be slow and take a ton of CPU. So I came up with something else.<p>At the same time I was working on a web scraper + screenshotter using PhantomJS that talked to RabbitMQ. I thought: why render the screenshot at all on the client? I have all the same resources; I can recreate the environment from source, on my own time, asynchronously, without making the client do the work for me and slowing down their browser. So the implementation I came up with does the following:<p>1. Maintains a rolling 5-element array of HTML snapshots (usually via document.firstChild.outerHTML), tied to setInterval. That part is easily configurable to your preference. The snapshots even contain a virtual cursor element that I just track using mousemove events.\n2. On error, collects the usual data using Raven (the client-side library that reports to Sentry, the open-source error aggregator).\n3. Rather than hit Sentry directly, the browser POSTs to a local route. That route separates the HTML snapshots from the Raven/Sentry data, and creates UUIDs for each snapshot to create S3 filenames.\n4. The Sentry data is sent to Sentry along with the S3 filenames, and the HTML + filenames are put on a RabbitMQ queue.\n5. A separate process is listening to the queue, grabs HTML off the queue and renders the page using the CSS (no scripts) from the running webserver. The screenshot is then uploaded to S3.\n6. A Sentry plugin displays those images in the bug report, assuming the S3 urls are valid. They may take a while to resolve but they usually show up in < 2 minutes.<p>Since there are a lot of moving parts, I&#x27;ve always wanted to create a simple devops service out of this, but I haven&#x27;t had the time, being busy with other projects. But if there is interest, I could open-source some of the components.",1409057184

Companies and institutions that had radically different operating systems and hardware, it wasn&#x27;t a matter of writing software for a machine that ran either &#x27;Windows or Unix.&#x27; You had to support the lisp machine vendors and a variety of mainframes/minicomputers. Emphasis on &#x27;Common.&#x27; The theoretical possibility was that you could write a program on a MacIvory and then run it on your Symbolics Machine, ThinkingMachines machine, Unix Machine, Windows machine, PDP-11, Dandelion, DEC Alpha etc...<p>Go write a C (or Python for that matter) program that lets you access the file-system port-ably on a huge variety of operating systems using only the C standard. I suspect it will be difficult.<p>Anyway, you couldn&#x27;t be any more wrong. You&#x27;ve limited the &#x27;entire world&#x27; to essentially two similar platforms, one of which (Windows) isn&#x27;t really that well supported.<p>The whole point is that it tried really, really hard to satisfy the entire lisp world, which included a number the larger players who were put out of business by Moore&#x27;s law and cheap generic hardware rapidly outpacing expensive special purpose hardware.<p>All this said, Common Lisp (and Scheme, and it&#x27;s implementations) have features that the general programming community is still rediscovering 30 years later. Dismissing it as something that sucks because the people involved didn&#x27;t try hard enough is incredibly myopic.<p>tl;dr: Nu-uh.",1409056115
8226721,comment,8226139,8226626,3,0,davexunit,,,">the language is pretty much designed for writing JSON-style configuration except as a formal programming language, which is what the vast majority of Nix code is (both package definitions and system configurations).<p>Guix uses an embedded domain specific language that is also designed for easily writing package recipes, but it uses s-expressions instead of something that is &quot;JSON-style&quot;.  Also, Nix build scripts are written in Bash, whereas Guix build scripts are written in Scheme.  I think that makes Guix more consistent in its programming style.<p>>Additionally, with Nix, you can be close to certain that if you build something twice, you&#x27;ll get the same result, because it can&#x27;t access impure resources.<p>Guix has this same certainty because it uses the Nix daemon, and the defaults are a bit stricter than Nix.<p>>Finally, because Guix is a GNU project, the official repositories are going to go nowhere near non-free software.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t host your own non-free packages or use someone else&#x27;s non-free packages.

Someone who&#x27;s in it for the long run through all of the peaks and troughs experienced on the startup journey. If you own the majority of the shares and your friend&#x27;s main interest is the salary you&#x27;re paying him/her, then his/her goals are not closely aligned with yours.<p>I don&#x27;t know how YC will view this but my advice is to think about building a team of co-founders who will stick together through thick and thin and share in the success of the company as well as the struggles. I guess that&#x27;s why its so important to get good co-founders. You don&#x27;t want to give half your company to someone who you don&#x27;t believe offers a whole lot to the company&#x27;s success.

8226656,comment,8226139,8226397,3,0,mcherm,,,"> Dealing with multiple library changes at once is an order of magnitude more difficult than dealing with them one-at-a-time.<p>Curious... I have exactly the opposite experience. I find that a certain amount of time is required to carefully regression-test my application code after upgrading a library. Doing this 23 times for my 23 different dependencies that need to be upgraded can be quite costly. If I, instead, upgrade all of the libraries at once and perform my extensive regression testing just once, I save a great deal of effort.<p>That&#x27;s if everything goes smoothly. If something does NOT go smoothly and I encounter an error, then I need to determine which upgrade caused the problem. Most of the time (85% perhaps?), that turns out to be easy and obvious just by looking at the error that presents itself. In the remaining cases, I simply roll back half of the package upgrades and start binary-searching to identify the culprit (or culprits in the case of a conflict between libraries).",1409054982

8226650,comment,8224227,8224227,5,0,reboog711,,,"I&#x27;ve written three books for a traditional publisher (Osborne / McGrawHill ) back at the turn of the century.  They were on Adobe (then Macromedia) ColdFusion: <a href=""http://www.instantcoldfusion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instantcoldfusion.com</a> .<p>At the time, they were estimating 20K units as the break even point.  Most books sold 5K units, give or take.  I still get royalty statements with returns, despite having no sales in years.  No chance I&#x27;ll ever make up the advance and start receiving royalties.<p>However, having books with your name on it makes it very easy to convince people who have no way to judge your skills that you know what you are doing.  I believe it helped launch my consulting career.  I start my 15th year in business in about a month.<p>After the books; I moved onto writing shorter-length articles and podcasting.  In my years of podcasting ( <a href=""http://www.theflexshow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theflexshow.com</a> ), I made the same amount of money as I did publishing those three books for Osborne.  ( Thanks to a six month sponsorship from Adobe ).<p>I kept track of my time on my second and third book.  I averaged 20 hours per chapter, which is probably slightly less than 1 hour per page.<p>When Adobe Flex took off [and publishers started calling]; they were estimating 5K units as a roaring success for a book.  So, things changed in that decade.  However, I was smarter at that point and asked about marketing / sales questions.  I would think someone wanting to publish a book could tell me what the size of the market was and what their expected penetration was.  But, all I got was a lot of blank stares, with the occasional &quot;O&#x27;Rielly had  book that did well&quot;.  I passed on writing any books on Flex.<p>When Flex/Flash took a nose dive; I shut down my podcast and turned focus back to writing.  The results are a self-published training course on AngularJS for Flex Developers ( <a href=""https://www.lifeafterflex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lifeafterflex.com</a> ).  It uses the &quot;Authority&quot; model of publishing, with the lowest tier being pay what you want; and the highest tier including 6 hours of screencasts on AngularJS.<p>The series has seen more staying power than I expected [Pay what you want sales trickle in a few each month; although no one has purchased the higher tiers since launch].   I do expect to make up my cash expenditure on the project (Copy editing + Web site design); but I&#x27;ll never make up for my time.  Total sales have been in the $2K range.<p>But, I had a client hire me to do a conversion of an app from Flex to AngularJS; so that doesn&#x27;t hurt the &#x27;cash flow&#x27;.<p>I think the release would have been more successful it it came a year and a half earlier.  I also think I may have built it for a market that is too narrow.<p>Right now; I&#x27;m working on extending that series to include a book about building the backend with NodeJS instead of ColdFusion.  It should be out by the end of next month.<p>Hopefully some of this is interesting.",1409054861

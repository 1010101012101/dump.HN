6512551,comment,6506536,6507658,1,0,bigiain,,,"Thanks for that. They&#x27;re useful numbers for me, because I&#x27;ve got this plan<p>My current side-project involves a RaspberryPi (sitting in my loungeroom on my home ADSL connection), iRedMail, full disk encryption, a handful of inexpensive VPS providers with APIs that allow automated provisioning (DigitalOcean, NineFold, and Hetzner  to spread out the jurisdictions)  with the RasPi opening a reverse SSH tunnel for ports 25 and 465. Add in a DNS provider with a useable API so the &#x27;Pi can spin up and shut down VPSes itself and update MX records to suit, and VPS images configured to not log anything mail-related, and I think I&#x27;ve gone as far as I can to secure my end of all my email. Having physical control of the hardware/storage that my email relies on won&#x27;t protect me against NSA level targeted-at-me snooping, or even local law enforcement with sufficient &quot;probable cause&quot; to get a judge to sign a search warrant, but at least I&#x27;ll _know_ if someone grabs my server hardware. (Hmmm, I wonder if there&#x27;s some NSL-type coercion that could be used against my partner to force her to let someone take/image my &#x27;Pi while I&#x27;m not home, and not be allowed to tell me?)<p>Possible over-paranoid ideas include refusing port 25 smtp connections that wont negotiate a secured connection in response to a STARTLLS command, and possibly blacklisting mail originating from any of the 8 known PRISM collaborators. I like the _idea_ of ensuring none of my mail arrives from known-intercepted sources, but reality dictates otherwise since way too many of the people I really do want to communicate with are exclusively using gmail/yahoo for email (or worse still, have migrated largely to Facebook messaging instead of email).",1381197500

6512545,comment,6511491,6512201,29,0,mrterry,,,"I&#x27;ve worked in ICF for a nearly a decade. I think NIF research is a necessary step to a ICF based power source. If NIF demonstrates ignition, it can be used to validate our physics models of ICF (turbulence, fusion product transport, thermal conduction, etc). These physics questions are shared by all ICF approaches. However, a fusion power plant will use entirely different laser technology [1], and most likely a different target design [2]. After showing that the physics works, there is still a lot of engineering work needed before building a reactor.<p>[1] An ICF power plant will be pulsed at 1-10 Hz. NIF is a flash-lamp pumped glass laser, which takes ~12 hours to cool between shots. A power plant would likely be diode-pumped sold state laser since these can meet the required repitition-rate.<p>[2] The indirect drive target that LLNL is pursuing on NIF is not very efficient. You spend a lot of energy heating the hohlraum. Directly driven targets (blast the capsule directly rather than heating a gold can to make x-rays) should be much more efficient. There are also several ideas for ways to ignite a target more efficiently (shock ignition, fast ignition), but these need additional laser hardware.<p>@sam Though I work in ICF, I was sad to see the innovative confinement concepts (magnetic confinement) cut a couple years ago.  I think it is short sighted.  Fusion need to work and get smaller and we should keep our options open. Hope you managed to get a thesis out before the walls fell.",1381197410

I also assume that there is some non-zero risk of a more catastrophic accident, which will then cause further hand-wringing, but I expect it to occur in a crash that was unlikely to be survivable or for it to involve someone doing something completely moronic.

6512522,comment,6508043,6512401,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"Once again, it&#x27;s open source we are talking about here. You do realise the problems you describe are also prevalent in other content management systems and publishing platforms? Wordpress is the worse offender for global variables, the theming system in Wordpress mixes HTML,CSS,JS and PHP together, the code-base is a mixture of object-oriented and procedural code as well. But it powers most of the web. Any blog you visit is most likely powered by Wordpress and why is that? Because it works.<p>Dropplets might not have the prettiest code, but there aren&#x27;t many projects out there that do. In-fact, Dropplets is no worse than Wordpress is and that hasn&#x27;t stopped Wordpress being hugely successful. Why? Most people don&#x27;t care how things are coded if they work. Dropplets works, Wordpress works. If it works, who cares really? As a developer, I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m not a code purist. My clients don&#x27;t care either if I use Wordpress or Dropplets for their site.<p>Frameworks do have the added advantage of giving you things like encryption, database abstraction and a structure to adhere to, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting to do things for yourself, sometimes understanding things on a lower-level makes you a better developer. Besides, the overhead of a PHP framework would be too much for a project like Dropplets in my opinion. Considering it&#x27;s database-less, you don&#x27;t need any database abstraction, ORM, no custom-built session management or complicated caching libraries.<p>Even a framework as light as Codeigniter would be far too heavy to build something like Dropplets on-top of. And people need to realise the future of PHP is not within frameworks, the Composer package manager means we can include what we want in our projects like a framework without the added overhead: include only what you need and ignore everything else.<p>I was hoping to avoid a framework, language, code-quality discussion but I guess it&#x27;s fair people raise their hands after I question the intent of the comments on this submission. At the end of the day, good code is important, but as developers we know that it just isn&#x27;t possible to write good code all of the time without help.<p>This highlights why open source is important and I think if people truly care about good code, they should roll up their sleeves and help. You can&#x27;t deny Dropplets is pretty-darn cool. Not nearly enough people contribute to projects like this. I&#x27;ve forked the project and am planning on helping clean up the code-base a little bit if it means more people will use it.<p>I thought the whole point of open source was getting your ideas and work out there so others can improve it, not criticise it. If we spent all of our time perfecting something, most open source projects in existence would probably not exist. Sometimes it&#x27;s best to get something that works, but isn&#x27;t exactly coded to God-like developer levels out into the public. Criticism stems open source. We need to embrace imperfection and achieve perfection as a whole over time.",1381197019

However, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily agree that all laws are necessarily oppressive or, if they must be oppressive by your terms, need to be resisted. After all, there are cases of theft, vandalism, murder, rape, fraud, conspiracy, etc - all of which would require &#x27;oppression&#x27; through the force of law for the good of the community.<p>I have no problem with your lone person who wants to use drugs and is harming no one - but laws in general presume consequences for violating norms within a society.

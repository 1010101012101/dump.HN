All good information to learn the language had to be taken from books (which cost money, although there are very good books out there) or training courses (which cost even more money, but are a pretty good way to do things, especially for teams).<p>Most of the stuff on the official website is either rather short in content, or made as reference manual rather than a tutorial. I was hoping that LYSE would become the de-facto free learning guide out there for Erlang.

We won't be taking a cut from the merchant's revenue but instead charge them one time low flat fee for running the deal on our site.<p>We got an idea form this quora post (read last answer):\nhttp://www.quora.com/How-did-Groupon-solve-the-marketplace-startup-chicken-and-egg-problem<p>In our beginner days we are thinking of adding a 'Tipping Point' feature.  Meaning users will be able to secure a coupon for free, however, it will only get activated once they send a secret link to two other friends and those two friends download the deal.  \nwhen I think as a consumer I feel that forcing the user to perform an action (sharing in this case) is not a good practice, however, from a startup point of view we will really need people signing up.<p>OR our other option is that we don't tie activation of the deal with sharing but instead have a karma point system.

But also, <i>dtf'</i> will <i>delete characters until it matches a' but also delete that '</i>. T and F goes backward.. you can put a number in front of the command to <i>delete until it matches the nth '</i>, etc. It looks like a lot of command.. but it's all the same basic ideas.<p>So to answer your question, yes you can use vim effectively with less than 10 commands.. but once you know those 10, it's a matter of seconds to learn 100+ which would make you extremely more effective.<p>And as my ""top"" commands.. I'd say definitely:<p><pre><code>  ciw *deleting the current word*\n  cit *deleting between the current html tag*\n  ci) *deleting between the ()*\n\n  With surround plugin:\n  ds' *deleting the surrounding '*\n  cs'"" *changing the surrounding ' for ""s*\n  / *incremental search*\n  o/O inserting new lines.</code></pre>",1315576055

Add in R (overwrite mode), o (start a new line), !(run a command at the command line then return to the file you were editing), crtl-ws (split windows), Ctrl-ww (switch windows),Ctrl-p (auto complete), various movement keys(I really only use h,j,k,l, $,^,Ctrl-f, Ctrl-b) and you have 100% of what I know about Vi.

2978024,story,,,6,6,cd34,"Ask HN: Why seek seed funding/Investors?",,"A brief backgrounder:<p>I've been self employed since the late 80s and have run multiple companies.  None have ever exited/sold. More often I transitioned into a different market -- from PC Sales to PC Repair to Network Installation, building ISPs, arguably the first DSL deployments for a non-Bell entity, wiring buildings with shared Internet before it was popular and over to web hosting.<p>During the DSL deployment, we did an investment pitch, but, couldn't answer one question - How much money do you need? We had prepared our pitch but didn't expect that question to be asked at the meeting. It was profitable enough at the time that we really didn't need cash - those investors approached us.<p>I pitched a business plan I wrote for a friend, had lunch at Capitol Grill with the investor and my friend and watched the investor write a check on the spot. After the company was formed, I was ousted. The investor called me at home, offered to fly me to meet him for dinner because he thought I was the driving force behind the company getting where it needed to go and without me, he felt his investment would be lost. The company still hasn't delivered on the business plan I wrote in '98 which would have been like Pandora for Independent Artists.<p>The question I ask is this:<p>Why do I need investors?<p>I see everyone clamoring to get seed funding to build this or that startup, but so few actually have a revenue plan in mind.  Since I can self fund, what benefit do I have giving away part of my company? Since I come from a 'doer' background, if it looks like it will work, and will be profitable, I do it. If I can't figure out a revenue model, I don't do it.<p>An investor won't magically figure out a revenue model for an idea. All they are doing is providing runway/development funds to deploy more quickly to get the next round of funding so that they can exit at some point. It is in an investor's best interest to be able to direct a company they funded to the next level of investment, and, to make sure the chosen team can get there.<p>Why should I take a cash infusion to give up a piece of my company so that later I can take a larger cash infusion and give up another piece of my company? The odds that the investment will make the company magnitudes richer seem slim.<p>I have two ideas in mind - one where there is a sole competitor in a space I feel is greatly underserved and extremely profitable based on the current competitor's pricing. There has been recent demand and inquiries for alternatives to that product. With today's technology, I believe I could knock out a working demo in a month and could start selling it. I've got the resources to build it, deploy the product, have a local testbed, etc. With the current expected profit margin, it becomes self-sustaining very quickly. My best salesperson is my competitor. I own the existing product and I have dealt with its assumptions and problems long enough that I know what it would take to fix it. The current product ignores IPv6 and they have stated that it isn't on the drawing board. The product absolutely needs to support IPv6 due to a few issues.<p>The other idea is a pure acquisition play -- develop the app and have some company purchase it. A year ago when I started working on it, I ran into technical limitations which Google has addressed in recent versions of Android and phone manufacturers are starting to produce the hardware that makes the idea functional. A client spoke with a few Fortune 500 CEOs and is convinced that their company could sell and market the app.<p>Again though, why do I need investors?<p>Making another multi-million dollar company won't be substantially affected by a cash infusion.  An investor might bring the possibility of an acquisition, but, I believe the product will have four large networking companies interested enough to open dialog.<p>In short, why are YOU looking for funding rather than just doing it? Every business I've built has had to solve a few needs. It had to be profitable enough for me to be able to afford to live, pay for house, car, family, food, entertainment, etc. That doesn't mean I sat around waiting for someone to open a checkbook before I started working on an idea. Ideas were ranked on a few metrics, and, handled in an order that seemed to make sense. Not every idea of mine has paid off and I've had some really lean years, but, I've never entertained the thought of an investor buying a portion of the company without wondering what he and I would\nget out of it.<p>One potential thought was bringing in an investor once I had an idea that scaled. I.e. it takes $x to do Y, with 4x I can do 6Y. However, a cash investment only alters the time to reach 6Y. Even if it was a substantial investment, I don't believe it would shorten the time by an order of magnitude.<p>As an aside, I was at a startup networking event and had three people approach me with funding offers while a dozen other startups were begging for funding. To my knowledge, none had any idea what the concept was, I had never shown interest in getting investment capital, and only briefly mentioned to a few people that I was working on an idea. Four months later I am reminded by one investor that wanted to discuss my idea that they were still interested in investing and I asked 'Why?'. He didn't have an answer.<p>Why should I take someone else's money?<p>As a side note, I was unable to post this as a link on Google+, it instantly responded that the site wasn't available.",1315575330

I can recall the point when I realised that the 'old way' of implied speech was dead in public discourse with this article<p><a href=""http://blogs.smh.com.au/thedailytruth/archives/2006/11/dirty_pool.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.smh.com.au/thedailytruth/archives/2006/11/dirty...</a><p>It's not going to make a lot of sense out of context. In context, it was an article that came out when a superstar athlete in swimming, a national hero, announced his retirement, and the media pundits were basically of the opinion that he was somehow being a traitor to Australia.<p>This article is lampooning the slavering media, not the athlete. To someone brought up with classic Australian English (similar in nuance to British), it's <i>blisteringly</i> obvious what this article is getting at by halfway through the second sentence. As in, 'it's not worth pointing out' obvious. I thought the article was tedious and waaaaay too long, but the premise was funny.<p>What was scary was that only about 10% of the people commenting understood what the article was about - the rest completely missed the point, thinking that this was another article calling the athlete a traitor, and rushing to his defense. The article was actually saying ""leave the athlete alone, damn the media are reactionary idiots"".<p>Like I said, you'll read it now and it'll probably seem more obvious out of context.<p>Examples are kind of hard to come up with off the cuff, so what other examples... When we first started watching 30 Rock, we were fairly puzzled and joked that ""surely this doesn't have American writers"" due to the high amount of innuendo and unpsoken communication in it; jokes that are woven into discourse without having to be focused on and made obvious.<p>Compare to the more frequent style of US TV, my classic example of a Friends episode where the joke is ""Books are so expensive, if only there was a place you could borrow them, and give them back when you're finished!"", which gets a dirty look from character B. Joke made, move on. Nope, character B has to say ""There is, it's called a library"". That kind of punchline being eviscerated from a joke and laid out on a plate is anaethema to British comedy.<p>I also find it more difficult to speak in metaphor with an American audience, who usually take a much more literal interpretation of what's being said (of course, it varies considerably among Americans - New Englanders seem to understand this kind of speech much more easily).<p>I do agree that British English speakers are more reticent, but in something of a different way. I spent three months going coast to coast in the US and one thing I loved about it was that Americans just talk to strangers in a way you don't get in other English-speaking countries. Random people walking in the same direction or on the same public bus would just start talking and you'd end up with a good conversation out of it. That rarely happens here.<p>I've probably waffled on enough at this point (I'm a little drunk), so perhaps best leave it there :)<p>NOTE: I hate the way HN expires internal links. What, am I going to maliciously link to this reply page? Just because the above took a while to write in this little box shouldn't mean I should run the risk of having to lose a comment I spent some time on. Luckily this time I had it in pageback, but I've lost other comments on other browsers. The point of proscribing pondered (perhaps ponderous?) positations is perfectly puzzling, I put forth.

There is only one looping construct. The only polymorphism mechanism is interface, but interfaces are both very simple and flexible. This is like what Lua does with tables.<p>This also means that when a feature introduces complexity into the language, the Go authors choose to discard it. There are advantages and disadvantages with exceptions, but I think what ultimately motivated the Go authors to leave exceptions behind is that it may complicate things. And Go also doesn't have any kind of compile-time generic, so one can't write functions like append() and copy() in pure Go.",1315574128

Don't confuse this with Apple somehow being an (evil) exception to natural conduct in the industry. Note also that Samsung has infringment suits against Apple. And of course there are many other cases not related to Apple that involve design infringement. This is how the game is played, for better or worse. I don't think you'll find a major company out there that doesn't concern itself with patents and legal action against its competitors when it feels it may have the grounds to do so.<p>Edit: Hm, I don't want to speak too quickly here, but after looking at your profile I'm guessing that you already have a strong opinion about Apple that I'm not likely to sway.

The vast majority of poker tracker users are vaguely aware that some db with a goofy name exists, but that's about it. The number of them who know what a foreign key is is a rounding error.<p>And the reason poker attracts so much technology is the same reason the stock market does: there's a hell of a lot of money to be made. A $50 piece of software is worth what you pay for it 10,000 times over if it even improves your win rate by 1% (and Poker Tracker most certainly does much more).

Fact is, Google and Apple excel at two different things. Google can't release any product at Apple's price point because they can't achieve such an anal level of quality, Marissa Mayer's 30 shades of blue be damned. Apple can't compete directly with Google because they insist on making pricey products that cost money, and because making a free suite of things completely contradicts their philosophy.<p>My <i>favorite</i> rumor is the Apple vs Nintendo rumor, because first off it makes more sense (iPod touch vs DS), and second off because both companies make excellent products but design them from different points of view, Nintendo focusing on innovative gaming and Apple focusing on its outright perfectionism. The one that <i>would</i> be my favorite rumor but is absolutely true is Google vs Facebook, and that's the one that interests me most if Google's making its own OS.

Any proof to back up the idea they might abuse data?<p>If not then what foundation does your mis-trust have?<p>My point still stands though - if you dont trust them with your data dont use them. If you dont trust your data will be safe in future dont use them.<p>If the ""big brother"" future ever happens I suspect which company your with will be the least of our problems :) Indeed I would argue that going with a larger company (especially one that has refused to hand over data already) is more sensible - because smaller ones have no power against governments.",1247058815

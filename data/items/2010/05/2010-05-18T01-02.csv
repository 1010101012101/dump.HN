This is the ""preferred"" way if you need to query the database for something that's related to multiple different views.  For an example of that, see the django-pagination app.",1274147925

One thing I like about it over other keyboards (Microsoft Natural, for instance) is that it doesn't maintain the leftward 'sweep' of the keys. The MS Natural is perfect for the right hand: fingers 'sweep' up and down along the axis of the wrist/elbow. But the left hand, while pointing the wrist in the right direction, forces a finger sweep that's now nearly perpendicular to the wrist. It's mindboggling.<p>So two things hold me back: I've grown to love 'short travel' keys: if activation was at 1mm I'd be ecstatic.<p>In reality, I'll probably order it here shortly: I need something that's more comfortable. Getting the foot pedal as well (for shift) is probably the best combination.<p>Do you use a foot pedal? If so: single or triple? From years of bad habits, I pretty much only use left shift and ctl (even going so far as to use my ring finger for QAZ): I think moving that motion to my feet would be a pretty good change.<p>Apart from eagerly awaiting your reply, I have to say: I don't see how our voting history would have much to do with our preferred keyboard layout.",1274146947

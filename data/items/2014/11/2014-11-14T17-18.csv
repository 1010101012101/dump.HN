Even if it&#x27;s not your thing, look into being a VA (tipo assistente virtual) cause there will be people in the US/Europe who&#x27;ll want to pay ever-so-slightly less per hour for someone to do their admin work, fill databases, whatever. This is what I do while I develop my own project and it pays the bills + a little extra.<p>For housing, if your family is a &quot;traditional&quot; Brazilian one, I suppose you live with them still, but when you get enough $$ to even share a room with someone else, use OLX, etc and go to the universities to see housing postings (I know USP has them). For a car, SP is already car-hell, but I know the metro/bus isn&#x27;t all that pleasant either, though you&#x27;ve got some BRT lines and non-peak hours you can certainly use the metro for.<p>Baby steps, the trick is never to quit.<p>Also, <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/top-tech-firms-scout-for-talent-in-brazil-7000035813/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/top-tech-firms-scout-for-talent-in-braz...</a>",1415987989

I think the root problem is that there never was a competiitive build up. You could easly imagen many diffrent companys starting out locally, say in big citys, and then to add more and more people, eventuall, you will get competution that way. These companys will soon find it profutable to rent out there wires to higher levels.<p>But non of this works if you have one company or the state build up a network and only then you start competition. Some people ignore the diffrence between free markets and privatisation/monopoly deregulation. This is the problem we are facing in tons of places. Free market get a bad wrap because privatisation often produces bad results.<p>Solving this problem now is really hard. One solution is that you just have the government build all the wires and rent them out low level to companys. Another is to deregulate completly and hope after some dark times market pulls threw. Another is to start doing fine grained regulation of every aspect.<p>I am very sceptical about government regulation that involve things lime you are suggesting, regulatory capture and the revolving door are a real problem if your regulation is to technical.<p>I dont have the solution, economiclly speaking all of these are very suboptimal.",1415987945

The only time I find the unibar in chrome annoying is when I&#x27;m searching for something specific to google... and effectively have to type google twice (first time sets the search site to google).<p>As for the developer tools, I do wish it was closer to either the chrome dev tools or firebug myself, it looks too much like the IE10+ tools, which I find annoying.  But that&#x27;s a matter of preference.<p>This is a matter of raw performance, not a subjective UI.. FF has made a lot of effort into improving JS at its&#x27; core... Chrome has worked to expanding the DOM in interesting ways.  IE has taken a pragmatic approach to refining what comes from both, though having their own issues.  The browser ecosystem today is so much better than it has ever really been, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.<p>You can relatively easily create your own skin against a Firefox base.  AFAIK it&#x27;s still all XUL wrapped around a web view, and pretty easy to get into, admittedly last time I tried was 6+ years ago.

It is guaranteed to use more memory (expect 3~5%), but be MUCH MUCH MUCH faster. Typically you can trade off running one less Puma worker to decrease memory usage, and the increase in speed may make up for it. Alternatively you can bump up to 2x dynos, and cut the number of dynos you have in half. If you haven&#x27;t tried 2.1.3 or above do yourself a favor and revisit. The 2.1.3 patch means memory grows much more slowly.<p>Also if you didn&#x27;t see my post on memory profiling: <a href=""http://www.schneems.com/2014/11/07/i-ram-what-i-ram.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneems.com/2014/11/07/i-ram-what-i-ram.html</a> (It got over 40 upvotes on reddit, and like 3 on HN, again...HN what is going on?

That post shows you how to remove ~30% starting RAM (by bumping mail version to 2.6.3+) and shows you can profile and remove libraries that are using a ton of memory in your app.<p>You can also use something like puma_worker_killer (or unicorn_worker_killer) to tame your memory growth if it only balloons over 512mb after a while, but ultimately those two solutions are bandaids.<p>Ruby 2.0 isn&#x27;t going to be supported forever and the generational GC is definitely here to stay. Maybe try the 2.2.0 preview (it&#x27;s on Heroku), it has 3 generations (total) which means much less retained memory and you still get speed performance improvements.<p>I see most of the bigger production apps using 2.1+ fwiw.",1415987734

With a for loop you still need to know how many &quot;troops&quot; you have and then go and do something with every one of them, one by one.<p>&quot;foreach&quot;-style loops with iterators in many languages eliminate the need for knowing how many element you exactly have, but you <i>still</i> have the code for explicit &quot;take the next element&quot; operation.<p>Vectorized operations are the next logical step, where the code for iteration (&quot;visiting each one&quot;) is completely hidden. So instead of explicit for-loop, or equally explicit map function, you just apply the operation directly to the list and get a list as a result. This is nice, because it eliminates A LOT of syntactic and semantic noise from the code which mainly works with collections.<p>Such vectorization is available in many languages as a library - for example in Python via NumPy, where you can say &quot;numpy.array([9,6,7]) + 4&quot; and get &quot;array([13, 10, 11])&quot; as a result.

If you care about apprehending criminals actually responsible for crimes you should care about this too. A reoccurring subtext is that law enforcement cares more about quantity than quality, but data quality is hugely important. These dragnets are the equivalent of a House TV Series body scan, and the arguments that characters in the show made apply here.<p>One of the consequences of a dragnet and too much low quality data is the risk of circumstantial evidence leading to the conviction of the wrong individual. The minds of investigators and district attorneys are susceptible to all the biases that plague any other field including confirmation bias. Project Innocence has revealed heaps of wrongful convictions based on low quality data, even when police corruption wasn&#x27;t at fault. Dennis Fritz and Ron Williamson for example were convicted for murder based solely on bad circumstantial evidence while the real perpetrator remained unpunished for over a decade.<p>It&#x27;s not just privacy advocates who should care about stopping these kinds of surveillance techniques.

Ultimately the only thing that can stop this is a phasing out of 2G entirely but that won&#x27;t happen any time soon, and even once it&#x27;s done, by that point law enforcement will have got used to the ability to just follow everyone around all the time and would insist that they MUST be able to use these devices otherwise chaos and anarchy would follow, so they&#x27;d probably mount a vigorous lobbying campaign to get the signing keys.",1415985516

It too will detect all occurrences of the two most frequently appearing types of transcription errors,[1] namely altering one single digit, and transposing two adjacent digits (including the transposition of the trailing check digit itself and the digit preceding it). But the Damm algorithm has the benefit that it makes do without the dedicatedly constructed permutations and its position specific powers being inherent in the Verhoeff scheme. Furthermore, a table of inverses can be dispensed with provided all main diagonal entries of the operation table are zero.<p>> The Damm algorithm does not suffer from exceeding the number of 10 possible values, resulting in the need for using a non-digit character (as the X in the 10-digit ISBN check digit scheme).<p>> Prepending leading zeros does not affect the check digit.<p>> There are totally anti-symmetric quasigroups that detect all phonetic errors associated with the English language (13 ↔ 30, 14 ↔ 40, ..., 19 ↔ 90). The table used in the illustrating example is based on an instance of such kind.<p>> Despite its desirable properties in typical contexts where similar algorithms are used, the Damm algorithm is largely unknown and scarcely used in practice.<p>That last point is also why I submitted this :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm</a>",1415985406

Let&#x27;s analyze that issue without resorting to an easy-to-defeat straw man ... basically, we can think of FREE things (free food on a cruise, etc.) as an egalitarian layer which delivers goods and services only up to a certain point -- usually this point is a reasonable one that would satisfy an average consumer. For example, if a person started eating all the food, stuffing it in their luggage, throwing it overboard, etc. then at some point the cruise operators would approach the person and either ban them from consuming any more resources (&quot;by force&quot;) or give them the option to continue doing it, but pay. This doesn&#x27;t mean the lower level wasn&#x27;t free.<p>What&#x27;s nice about free things is that it&#x27;s a safety net, and also lowers the barrier for new entrants and trying new ideas. But it&#x27;s only free up to a point. In MY opinion, you shouldn&#x27;t be sending 34% of the internet&#x27;s traffic and expect the same treatment as a person who is hosting a small website. At some point, you&#x27;re setting up SPECIAL agreements for crying out loud, with tier 1 providers, Google fiber, etc. Your cables are in their physical centers, and that&#x27;s favoritism, that&#x27;s physical presence which doesn&#x27;t scale to millions of companies even theoretically. So yeah, at some point the market participants should be free to negotiate their own agreements and prices, or refuse a level of service that exceeds what a &quot;free&quot; tier would get.<p>I am talking, of course, about the provider side.

This division eventually became aware of Diapers.com and its parent company Quidsi, and dispatched M&A chief Jeff Blackburn to initiate acquisition discussions.<p>Quidsi’s founders originally rebuffed acquisition offers from Amazon. So Bezos’s Amazon sent them a message, Stone [author of a book on Bezos and Amazon called &#x27;The Everything Store&#x27;] explains:<p>“Soon after, Quidsi noticed Amazon dropping prices up to 30 percent on diapers and other baby products,” Stone writes. “As an experiment, Quidsi executives manipulated their prices and then watched as Amazon’s website changed its prices accordingly. Amazon’s pricing bots — software that carefully monitors other companies’ prices and adjusts Amazon’s to match — were tracking Diapers.com.”
Diapers.com revenue growth eventually slowed under Amazon’s pricing pressure, and the founders engaged in acquisition talks, agreeing to a $540 million buyout.<p>As Stone tells it, Walmart eventually made Quidsi a better offer of $600 million, but it was too late by then.<p>“The Quidsi executives stuck with Amazon, largely out of fear,” Stone writes.&quot;",1415985140

8608162,story,,,6,5,pzxc,"Ask HN: Descriptive titles or original titles?",,"It saddens me that high-quality content, even if it&#x27;s extremely interesting for hackers, can fail to gain traction on HN because of the policy of using original article titles.  The author might write a great piece that lots of us would be very interested to read, but if they don&#x27;t pick a good title it will never last on HN long enough for anyone to see it.  I&#x27;ve seen many instances where something highly interesting was on the front page of HN for a short time - until a moderator came along and changed the submission to use the original title, even if it&#x27;s less descriptive. And then it bombs if the title isn&#x27;t eyecatching or if it doesn&#x27;t appeal specifically to the part of the content that HN would find appealing. An otherwise great article, that might have lots to appeal to HN readers, will fail for something as simple as the page title not emphasizing the part that hackers would find interesting but another part of the content.<p>I understand (or at least presume) that the intent of the &quot;original titles policy&quot; is to avoid people submitting clickbait titles just to bring undue attention to their submissions.<p>But isn&#x27;t there a way of applying the policy in a narrower way, so that great content that isn&#x27;t well-titled still stands a chance on HN?<p>(In my mind, I&#x27;m thinking that it should be relatively easy for mods to distinguish between title changes that are obviously clickbait, and title changes that are simply more descriptive of the content.  Right now, the policy is applied in an absolute way, which is evenhanded and fair, but means we&#x27;re missing out on some great stuff just because the original author titles their content generically or in a way that doesn&#x27;t mention the parts that would be interesting to HN readers)<p>I know this has come up before, and I fully expect <i>this</i> post to go nowhere.  But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try!  I really think that descriptive titles, not original titles, should be the order of the day. Just my opinion!",1415984629

8608137,comment,8607330,8607330,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"Google needed to do either of two things: make the software good enough to be acceptable, or provide source code so that people could fix the issues bothering them themselves. They did neither of those things. Instead, they took the open-source Android operating system, made a closed-source fork, and proceeded to go around breaking APIs to stop regular Android software from working.<p>When I got Glass in November 2013 (XE11), I could run an ssh client on it and use it with a Bluetooth keyboard, along with lots of other Android software. A month later (XE12), they somehow managed to break the dialog box API. And XE11 was configured with the most aggressive auto-updater you&#x27;ll ever see, so you couldn&#x27;t stay back. Four months after that, they released the brick-half-the-fleet update (XE16). (That happened because Glass was configured with no swap, all their users had 1GB memory devices, but all their internal testers had 2GB memory devices. The updater would run out of memory mid-update and die, leaving an unbootable system.) As a side effect, that update also flashes a hidden firmware so XE11 won&#x27;t boot anymore. Also, it strips out everything related to bluetooth keyboard support. Also, it disables touchpad gestures for Android apps.<p>Also, the terms of service for the Glass SDK are incompatible with the GPL, ban charging for Glass sofware, and ban advertising in Glass software, so there&#x27;s basically no third-party software and none coming.<p>Oh, and it sends all your photos to Google (can&#x27;t disable auto-backup even by rooting and messing with internals). And if you pair it with a phone, it copies any text messages stored on that phone, and sends those to Google.<p>This is very sad, because the hardware itself is excellent, and it (almost) does something that I really really wanted. XE11 worked well enough that I invested considerable time and energy into it, and I ended up walking away feeling like Google was constantly sabotaging my efforts.<p>Meanwhile the pace of actually-useful updates is utterly glacial; there clearly aren&#x27;t enough developers working on it to have any hope of fixing the outstanding issues. So yeah, I&#x27;ve given up hope on Glass. I&#x27;ll revisit it if they open the source code or announce new management with someone who understands software at the helm.",1415984400

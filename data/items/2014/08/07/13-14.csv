Any idea where the primary source for that information is?<p>I&#x27;m interested to see what magnetic shielding was used and how well they characterized the magnetic field in the experimental volume.  There was a mention of shielding against electromagnetic effects, but that could just mean a Faraday cage or Helmholtz coils, neither of which will reduce the B-field to zero.<p>Because the device is based upon microwaves in a conducting cavity, I would think that the first place to look for a theory of operation would be E&M, not quantum.  The level of force involved is the kind that you can see when interacting with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.  Normally we ignore the force produced by the interaction of currents with the Earth&#x27;s field, because they are so small.  Was a mu-metal shield used, and if so, what was the remnant field?  Was a stronger field induced to see if that increased the force?  I hope that the experimenters try this if they have not already.",1407419957

8147714,comment,8139669,8144179,2,0,mikeash,,,"Most countries already have that central authority, so that&#x27;s not a particularly big hurdle. Note that for most of the history of copyright in the US, it wasn&#x27;t automatic, and you had to register your work. Automatic copyright for simply creating something didn&#x27;t happen in the US until 1989. There&#x27;s still a central authority, as registration is still required for certain additional whatnot.<p>Of course, &quot;that&#x27;s how it was&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it a good idea. But it&#x27;s not completely disastrous.<p>I think most of your objections would be solved by a sort of hybrid system that I hinted at. Don&#x27;t start the exponential renewal until the 20 year mark. If you haven&#x27;t learned about the need for renewal by then, you clearly don&#x27;t need it. Start it at a dollar, so it&#x27;s a tiny barrier for anyone making any money at year 20.<p>By year 30 it&#x27;ll be a thousand dollars, and by year 40 it&#x27;ll be a million. This will start to scare off small time folks who aren&#x27;t making a ton of money. Highly profitable properties will be able to afford the fees for a while longer, although year 50 will hit a billion dollars a year, and soon after it&#x27;ll exceed the GDP of most countries.<p>So in essence, it breaks down to a 20-year period for even the worst crap, a ~30 year period for obscure but selling works, a 40 year period for properties that continue to be fairly profitable, and maybe a 50 year period for Mickey Mouse class stuff.<p>I think 20-30 years should be plenty to figure out how profitable something is going to be, so it shouldn&#x27;t much depend on how much money people had <i>before</i>, but how much they can make from the work. If we consider that a proxy for how valuable the work is to society (a bad proxy to be sure, but perhaps better than nothing) then why not allow profitable works to last longer? Make some money for Uncle Sam too.",1407419923

8147690,comment,8146995,8146995,10,0,gus_massa,,,"Short version:<p>Unless they believe the machine breaks some of the fundamental physics laws, the device must emit something. With this definition using a red LED Laser powered by a 1.5V battery in the back of the spacecraft is a &quot;no reaction mass&quot; thruster. The problem is that the momentum / energy ratio has theoretical limitations, and they are getting too much momentum.<p>Long version (based on a previous comment <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7162069"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7162069</a>):<p>I’ll try to explain what I had understood trying to find an explanations that don’t break the physics laws.<p>To move the spaceship you <i>need</i> momentum. You <i>must</i> use some particles to carry the opposite momentum away. It’s not clear, but the main candidates are photons (aka light). (The other possibility is gravitons, but that would be even more amazing)<p>The photons have no rest mass, but they have energy. So to produce them, you must &quot;spend&quot; some energy. The energy source can be carried in the ship (a nuclear reactor) or absorbed in place (solar panel).<p>If you are using a nuclear reactor, a small par of the mass of the atoms is transformed into energy and you put that energy in the photons. So the net effect is that some of the mass of the spaceship goes away, and it&#x27;s no long a &quot;no reaction mass&quot; ship. (The same idea is valid to electric batteries, but the mass difference comes from the chemical bounds and not from the nucleus.)<p>If you use a solar panel, then when you absorb the photons the spaceship gains a little of mass. Unless you have a mechanism to dissipate the mass the spaceship would get heavier. Luckily, the photons that you are using for propulsion carry a little of mass (and the heat you are dissipating also helps). So this is essentially a solar sail, you get some photons, and send them in a different direction, and the change in the direction of the photons give some momentum to your ship. Perhaps a complex setup (solar panel + led) can be more directional that a simple setup (mirror). Perhaps you can gain a x3 or x6 efficiency. (But someone has to do the calculations, because this might break the second law, unless you get a laser light and also dissipate some heat without a specific direction, and the net result as good as a mirror.)<p>In the previous comment, throwaway_yy2Di noted that with photons &quot;the ratio a photon&#x27;s momentum to energy is fixed at 1/c, which is 3.3E-6 N/kW&quot;. The problem of photons is that to get some moment you need a proportional amount of energy to create them. Another possibility is to create particle-antiparticle pairs and accelerate them, but this is even more inefficient that using photon and you get less than 3.3E-6 N/kW.<p>The alternative solution is to accelerate other particles (for example the hydrogen atoms in the rocket fuel), you don&#x27;t need energy to create them, because they are already there. So you can get more than 1/c=3.3E-6 N/kW, but it&#x27;s not a &quot;no reaction mass&quot; ship.<p>They claim 40 microNewton/28W = 1.4E-3 N/kW ~= 400000/c. This is in the like 400000 times the theoretical limit, so they have a measurement problem (or they&#x27;ll get a Nobel price).",1407419707

This happened to cordwainers, calculators, etc.<p>The reasoning for this is very simple. It&#x27;s why the Luddites were wrong then and the Luddites are wrong now. When a job is automated away, the benefit is distributed among three areas: 1. Automation company profit 2. Automation user profit 3. End customer costs. The net benefit is always positive, or else the automation would not be used in the first place. These 3 groups do not take their earnings and hide it under the mattress. This newly produced value has to be spent somewhere. So we end up with fields that were historically not viable, but because automation lowers the overhead of doing other things, now are viable.

The reason is simple: there are two main ways that the government finances itself: consumption taxes and earnings taxes. Earnings taxes are proportional, or even progressive; anyways, 0 earnings -> 0 taxes. On the other hand, even the homeless are paying consumption taxes - if they eat food, someone has bought it, and that someone also paid taxes; so, if you give food to a homeless person, you&#x27;re also donating a share of taxes you paid.<p>That way, everybody is taxed fairly - proportionally to how much they earn and consume.

Came in, noticed development practices were lagging (and this is the kindest term I can use). Tried, with the support of leadership, to bring the team forward, ever-so slowly, but it only resulted in more backlash. These people were deeply entrenched, not looking for change, and certainly not from the younger (early 30&#x27;s here) newcomer.<p>I came to loathe coming to work.

I&#x27;ve been freelancing since then and am 10x happier. I make significantly more in an hourly basis and have much more time to spend with my wife and son. I have different risk levels from your situation though. I live in Canada (free healthcare) and in a medium-sized city (relatively low cost of living). I&#x27;m still on good terms with the management team from my old employer (they know and acknowledge the difficulties I encountered as real barriers; they just didn&#x27;t take decisive actions IMHO) and they&#x27;ve told me the job is mine if I ever want to return.<p>I know this may not be a realistic option for you, but the overall thing I&#x27;ve learned through this process is that what may seem like a really big risk at first glance, becomes apparently much less risky the more you think about it in a calm and rational manner.

What’s a quantum vacuum virtual plasma? I’d never heard the term, so I dropped a note to Sean Carroll, a Caltech physicist whose work dives deeply into speculative realms of cosmology and quantum theory.<p>Carroll wrote back immediately, with a pointed message: “There is no such thing as a ‘quantum vacuum virtual plasma,’ so that should be a tip-off right there. There is a quantum vacuum, but it is nothing like a plasma. In particular, it does not have a rest frame, so there is nothing to push against, so you can’t use it for propulsion. The whole thing is just nonsense. They claim to measure an incredibly tiny effect that could very easily be just noise.” There is no theory to support the result, and there is no verified result to begin with.<<",1407417264

I switched to a BI/DW team 5 years ago because I did not enjoy building corporate CRUD apps all day. Working data in a large enterprise is really more of a mental challenge than a programming challenge.<p>The coding work is so much more enjoyable, only about 5% of the it is UI, the rest is all design and working the data. I absolutely hated how long it took to do the UI part of a crud app, so much that I steered my career around it.<p>Data work is so challenging because you truly have to understand every process you are taking data from and come up with creative ways to make that data useful to the business. The BI team at my work may not be the most advanced java guru&#x27;s but they are some of the most creative solution designers you can find in our company. They are also the team with the most experience and the most knowledge about our super complex business processes because you have to understand them all to produce useful analytics.<p>I also can&#x27;t stress how nice it is to have SQL as the most used tool in your toolbox. I scoffed at it as a simple data query tool before joining a data team. I now know it as the most efficient programming language I have ever used. Sure it can take a lot of mental effort to develop a complex query but it is so much faster than putting that logic in any other language. You simply ask a detailed question of the database and it returns an answer set to you. You do not need to tell it how to get he answer, the optimizer takes care of that for you and it does a much better job than you could ever do (99.9999% of the time). No more coding endless series of loops. A couple dozen lines of sql could take thousands of lines to code in java/c#/ruby/python etc.<p>There is also a whole new world of data science opening up right now and corporations are cashing in. I will be learning hadoop and map reduce very soon so we can position our team to offer a competitive advantage to our business through big data. I will have to learn R and python because they are used to gather and work all that data. The future is looking bright for data workers.",1407417208

As productivity goes up, you increase the guaranteed minimum income.  If you want more than the minimum, you go out and work, and the people who have only skills that can be done by a computer/robot more cheaply than a minimum wage work just leave the work force.  Should productivity go down (say we run out of fossil fuels without developing a cheap alternative or all our productivity starts going to dealing with run-away climate change) then you just decrease the guaranteed minimum income. --Mark Russo<p>This.",1407416464

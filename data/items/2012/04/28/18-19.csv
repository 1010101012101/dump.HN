They weren't just management and promotion companies, but rather more like schools where promising resident talent was honed and music would be written for and played by most fitting artists. If one goes through hits of the 50-70s, they will find that the same songs by one label would often be performed by multiple artists, sometimes for years, before that final breakthrough performance would come along when the perfect match between the singer and the song would be found.<p>It was, then, a matter of knowing what to look for in new talent and finding ways to bring out their strengths through good and appropriate songwriting. People these days often complain about the quality of music being lower than it used to be, but the truth is that for every hit of the early times there would be many times the number of ""duds"" and just unsuccessful attempts that would either be mediocre songs or bad matchings between the artists and the records they perform.<p>IMO, despite even that, I still personally think records of the past are a lot more full of substance and soul than anything released today.",1335639048

One person doing three jobs can fully understand what choices make the overal work more efficient. One DBA, one sysadmin and one dev only have direct insight into their own work. People, in my experience, can only optimize for what they understand and generally only care about their own work.<p>I believe this is why we are seeing roles, like devops becoming popular. Specialization introduces a communication overhead and most companies already do a terrible job of employee communication. Merging tightly coupled roles back together helps reduce friction and improve productivity.<p>In a small example such as your own, it probably works out closer to pipelining. The more common case, from my experience, is that the communication overhead and lack of understanding eat up more and more of your time as each new person is introduced.

Microsoft could've had an Apple like vertical integration(and immense profits) by making hardware too, but never made PCs. Licensing to PC clones drove the prices of PCs down and made them affordable to a wide swath of the world and helping the Internet come about. If computers cost $3000 like back in the day, adoption would have been quite low.<p>>Microsoft's legendary persistence -- fast following rival products and iterating them until they didn't suck and eventually drove competitors out of business -- would have been fruitless without the dominant position IBM simply handed to Microsoft with the original DOS deal.<p>Sure, but lots of companies have a lot of money to throw around but the difference with Microsoft was they kept at it and waited for missteps from competition while continuously making improvements.

Wages are already moving north of $200k for these positions because you can't find people with the basic skills for any amount of money.<p>Being a ""data scientist"" as currently defined in practice requires someone to be a polymath with skills that are individually high value and not commonly found together. Roughly speaking, you need some aptitude and experience in the following areas:<p>- mathematics, particularly statistics, computational geometry, machine learning, and probability theory<p>- parallel algorithm design, something for which most software engineers have no skill<p>- database ETL processes, formerly a highly specialized discipline only found in the database administration world<p>You can learn the mathematics in school or with some study. Most software engineers never develop a knack for parallel algorithm design even when they try e.g. virtually all software engineers who claim to know parallel algorithms can't explain why hash joins do not parallelize well. Lastly, ETL is something that isn't normally found mixed with the other two but which usually requires some significant experience to do correctly. Even if you are a master of mathematics and parallel algorithms, ETL skills are something you usually learn by apprenticing with someone who is an ETL master for a couple years.<p>Finding people that even have basic levels of skill at all three of these things is very difficult even if you loosen the criteria significantly. Unlike some other tech job fads, you can't mint a crop of data scientists in a year.<p>When I look at the junior level data scientists we trained internally with great basic skills out of school, it has taken years to develop them.

Nobody is likely to pay for the combined skill set.  Which means that having these skills is both a blessing and a curse depending on your point of view.  I can take any product from drawing to completion.  My resume scares most employers.  And, in many ways, rightly so.<p>Hiring someone who can do the work of five people is very risky.  You loose one person and your entire team is gone.  And, of course, there is no way that one person can have the productivity offered by a team of specialists.<p>In the end, someone with my skill set either ends-up doing their own thing or in a managerial position where the wide knowledge base and context gained from actually being able to do the work can be harnessed to guide and assist a team in achieving the required goals.<p>As an entrepreneur, having a wide skill set can be priceless so long as you start letting go as soon as you can start hiring specialists.  This can be hard for some.  It's great to be able to do it all when you want to launch something and save a bunch of money.  Once launched, you need to divest yourself from responsibilities as quickly as possible because you will hit productivity walls and you simply can't focus on everything at the same time.<p>The age of the generalist is pretty far gone.

Smart betters use all the info at their disposal. 538 is one of the smartest sources around. 538 was also able to highlight curious movement at In-trade well before it became obvious that someone was manipulating the McCain margin with heavy betting.<p>If I was placing any bet, I'd bet on 538's numbers - even at the state-level, before any betting market. Better to trust many aggregates of randomish samples (polls) over one highly-motivated, and non-random, sample. 538 goes the step further to weight polls based on their historical accuracy and weight samples based on predictions about party ID, demographics, etc. Just a highly tuned model with lots of data to support the tweaks.<p>It will be interesting to see how close 538, versus the betting markets, came based on electoral votes and percentage win.

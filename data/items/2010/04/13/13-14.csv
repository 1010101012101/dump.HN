You get lots of jobs directly and indirectly, you pay for the development of lots of interesting tech that has civilian/commercial applications (i.e. you are <i>creating wealth</i>), and you get the defence of the realm ""for free"" on top of all that!

1261960,comment,1261777,1261777,0,0,plesn,,,"The ""authenticity hoax"" is an intersting one, but the analysis is particularly shallow and consensual.<p>Basically he points out that the quest for ""authenticity"" is both opposed to progress (""consumer culture""...) and rather a quest of social markers. But he jumps to the conclusion that we should consequently ""accept [modernity's] trade-offs"". It seems like a typical example of paralogism: either your for us (our current implementation of progress, the powers in place) or you're against us. There's even a Godwin point as he gently critiques people who ""see a market economy and consumer culture as sterile and false (...) and who defend the world's most repressive cultures"". What??? If we're against consumerism we're for Stalin?<p>Nevertheless, what he points about ""authenticity"" is important as people who reject consumerism tend to throw the baby out with bath water and seek a return to an idealized past. The problem here is the lack of visible alternatives to our regimes (so, in some sense, the powerfull media and propanda industry).<p>However it is important to note that our overall interlinked and financiarized economy needs <i>a lot more progress</i> to transform itself into a more decentralized and resilient system: that's where local culture, organic food, mixed cultures, and others enter into the picture!",1271166943

I don't know whether they are. You can certainly infringe on a trademark without using the exact mark, and if someone brought out a tablet computer called the EyePad then the absence of the ""i"" would be no defence. But ""ContactPad""? ""JournalPad""? Not being a lawyer, I have no more than a guess. But my guess is that Apple's trademark on ""iPad"" is not in fact enough to make it illegal for someone else to sell a program that runs on an iPad and has ""pad"" in its name.)<p>> tell me the developer shouldn't have seen this coming a mile away.<p>Now, <i>that</i> I can certainly agree with.

I don't know how much it costs to make a regional UI alteration to Facebook, but I suspect that Mt Gamble doesn't either, and I doubt that it's free.\nI presume it can only help to save children if it results in the conviction of a paedophile.  How many have been convicted as a result of the button on Bebo or elsewhere?<p><i>Last week Mr Gamble announced the agency had received 252 complaints about Facebook during the first three months of the year - with 40% of them about the potential ""grooming"" of children.</i><p>Were these complaints about specific incidents or were they of a general ""Facebook sucks"" variety?  If the latter, bear in mind that Facebook has 23 million users in the UK (according to <a href=""http://www.clickymedia.co.uk/2010/01/facebook-user-statistics-january-2010/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clickymedia.co.uk/2010/01/facebook-user-statistic...</a>).<p><i>He said the complaints had come via e-mails and people using other means to complain to the centre as they could not do so via Facebook.</i><p>So people who wanted to complain to CEOP did so by emailing CEOP rather than Facebook.  What's wrong with that?  Or is Mr Gamble implying that it is impossible to send a complaint to Facebook, or that Facebook will not act on an allegation?<p>Finally, the sad story of Miss Hall suggests that the real problem is not the absence of a button, but the difficulty in identifying the likes of Peter Chapman as potential rapists and murderers in the first place.<p>Maybe Facebook <i>should</i> provide CEOP's button, but CEOP has so far failed to make good case.",1271165722

By that I mean - the two situations of you accelerating w.r.t the rest of the universe and the rest of the universe accelerating w.r.t. to you are physically indistinguishable. You can get that for rotation (in which case the B analog gives you Coriolis force) and for linear acceleration as well. I think in these limiting calculations you get some constant factors wrong (like the Newtonian escape velocity calculation) but the order turns out ok.<p>This ""analog of B"" is called the ""gravitomagnetic field"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitomagnetism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitomagnetism</a>) and NASA's GP-A and GP-B probes (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B</a>) are for measuring this effect near earth.",1271165221

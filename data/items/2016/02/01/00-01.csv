You get API access where the entire verification process can be automated on your end, and it&#x27;s out of your hands, so you have some kind of legal protection offloading the KYC risk to that party.<p>- Encrypt all internal employee messages, regardless if they are totally innocent looking a prosecutor will find some way to twist the emails and chats into a crime. Have a written data deletion policy for internal messaging so they are not saved forever, as deleting them to satisfy a business operations policy will prevent possible future obstruction or evidence tampering nonsense charges.<p>- Avoid any and all political ideology, don&#x27;t call your service DownWithTheFedCoin. Notice how the prosecutors made a point about Liberty Reserve&#x27;s name.<p>- If you create an asset pegged to a currency don&#x27;t use USD.<p>Finally have clear, concise instructions to resolve disputes, and some kind of phone number escalation procedure for users to actually talk to somebody. Better yet have a disinterested 3rd party to help moderate customer disputes in a totally transparent way instead of merely freezing accounts and ignoring their emails. As soon as somebody has their funds seized or delayed they run to regulators and lawyers to complain which in turn spawns government attention on your little cryptocurrency related service.",1454288334

Speaking directly about &quot;how to go about finding clients&quot;, here&#x27;s some things to think about when starting out:<p>* Portfolio: Everyone is going to ask you for your portfolio, so have that organized before you start doing outreach as this will increase your success rate when doing outbound &quot;marketing&quot;. You&#x27;ll be including this in all first touch correspondence.<p>* Activate Your Network: Most of the freelancers I speak to find work within their network. It&#x27;s a nice inbound flow, although a little unpredictable, but the key here is to make sure that everyone who knows you can code (I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re a programmer here) knows you&#x27;re available for work. When you first start, make sure to go out of your way to message your friends, start a conversation, and make sure they know you&#x27;re in the marketplace. It can be strange marketing to your friends, but getting over that feeling will increase your work pipeline.<p>* Positioning: We have found that while we can do a whole bunch of stuff (Ruby, Rails, Node, Python, Angular, React, Backbone, etc, etc.), this doesn&#x27;t position ourself as the first point of call when a friend-of-a-friend is asking for freelancers. More effective for us is to position as specialists in a certain skill (React/Node) so that way we&#x27;re the go-to for whenever someone is asking for around that skill set. (Note: I have anecdotal evidence to support this, but others may have a different experience)<p>* Outbound: While effectively all our pipeline is inbound now, in the early days I emailed effectively every design and dev shop in the bay and this generated some contracts. Effort to reward ratio was quite high. Just make sure you have your portfolio included in the email to minimize the back-and-forth. If you have boxes of business cards lying around, put them to work!<p>Overall, I have found consulting to be a well-paid, mostly unfulfilling line of employment that allows our team to maximize their time <i>not</i> working.<p>Good luck!",1454288271

This [0] indicates that Chrome uses Mozilla&#x27;s NSS to store certificates. The documentation for NSS indicates that it&#x27;s happy to work with certs stored on (or to store certs on) a smart card. :) Granted, the UI &quot;sucks&quot; for this, but that&#x27;s part of my point.<p>> I got the point about client certs being more convenient at the point of authentication.<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> not what I was saying. Client certs are <i>unguessable</i>, the authenticating partner has no need to store <i>any</i> significant information about the cert, and certs typically rest in the most secure storage the OS can provide.

You frequently <i>have</i> to offer the thing as an option so that people will start using it before UI design teams will deign to make the UI for that thing better.<p>>  A trivial number of the people who get them right, also don&#x27;t bother with PGP for email because that is even more painful.<p>This is kind of a tangent, but: I guess those people don&#x27;t use email clients that have adequate support for PGP.

Also, I find that 6 months is optimal for learning and self-improvement (useful if you want to become a manager down the line).<p>On top of all this, it is often less stressful than working for small clients who don&#x27;t have much money and have tight deadlines.<p>The main issue is that the barrier to entry is higher - They&#x27;re not just going to hire anyone.

This has been empirically refuted over and over again and I think there&#x27;s no successful way to defend this idea, but it&#x27;s a very appealing position on the face of it, so it&#x27;s something I hear a lot.<p>(2) The less commonly expressed, but much more legitimate one: Memory management problems just aren&#x27;t the biggest issues they deal with. I hear this from game developers from time to time (e.g. Jonathan Blow, though he&#x27;s not by any means the only one). This is, in my mind, a totally legitimate position. Viewed in this light, C++&#x27;s memory management primitives are simple ways to eliminate the most obvious errors, which helps prevent some (not all) crashes and vulnerabilities from reaching production. Rust is entirely a move in the wrong direction for these projects, because it adds nontrivial cognitive overhead.<p>Interestingly, people rarely ever describe reason (2) in those words, probably because the idea that you would opt in to less safety makes people queasy. But that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me; it&#x27;s legitimate to want less safety if your app doesn&#x27;t require it. (I do think, of course, that reason (2) is <i>not</i> legitimate if less safety makes your app vulnerable to e.g. remote code execution by network attackers and RCE would result in the leak of sensitive data or other game-over scenarios.)<p>I&#x27;ve actually been a proponent of solving (2) by adding easier ways to write unsafe code in Rust.

While I agree that web UI programming can undeniably be described as complex:<p>a) JS, HTML and CSS have been designed to build more than &quot;documents&quot; for over 10 years.<p>b) Contrary to the idea that these technologies lead to bad API, I see many high impact graphics toolkits moving to a CSS / HTML driven model even when the teams working on these toolkits are not majority web developers. Quick examples: GTK3 and Source 2.<p>c) There are many Javascript frameworks that do not require deep knowledge of all three of these technologies to produce something. The vast majority of Javascript UI toolkits, for example jQuery UI aim to remove the need for in-depth knowledge of HTML and CSS to produce user interfaces.<p>d) While I agree with you that there is no one true way to tie together these technologies, I think there are solid abstractions that tie HTML, Javascript and CSS together. I&#x27;ve been very excited about how terse and powerful d3 is for composing any kind of HTML/JS/CSS model.",1454285507

In order to learn about one subsystem, you could probably get an IDE (I&#x27;m picturing something LightTable-like here) to &quot;pull out&quot; all the relevant migrations that went into that particular subsystem, and just read them in order†. Each one would be <i>presented</i> with a bit of surrounding context for the feature-patch that introduced it, the way regular commits are presented with surrounding context from the file they affect.<p>So, rather than staring at a function&#x27;s git-blame trace together with commit history to try to deduce a reason for each of the (likely uncommented) lines in it to exist, you would instead just see that the function started simple, and then there was a feature-patch for feature Foo that added lines 1, 5, and 7 to the function, which all reference a global variable $Foo that was also defined elsewhere in the same feature-patch. Etc.<p>One of the big problems with &quot;only having the diffs&quot; is being unable to know what they add up to: usually, the only way to tell what &quot;flat schema&quot; a set of DB migrations add up to is to run them against a real RDBMS and then dump the resultant schema. But again, with a LightTable-like editor, I could easily imagine each feature-patch being presented together with the &quot;generated context&quot; of what the resultant function looks like at that point in the code&#x27;s history—or what it looks like now—with that feature-patch in play. You could tweak the feature-patch, save, and the code in the other pane would auto-update.<p>---<p>† One interesting thing is that there would definitely be times where a particular subsystem got a feature added, and then removed when it became unnecessary or was obviated by another feature. The feature might persist in other places (so you wouldn&#x27;t git-rm the entire feature-patch that introduced the feature) but rather than seeing a complete feature history for some subsystem Foo (+A, +B, -A), it would be useful to be able to get an &quot;abridged&quot; summary of Foo that just introduces feature B and pretends feature A never happened.<p>Both views would have their purpose; the abridged view would be more useful for first learning the subsystem, while the unabridged view would be more useful for understanding the codebase as a whole, since you could see why, for example, there are two logging systems in play—it would be clear in unabridged view that one is in the process of replacing the other, but there are some subsystems where the newer one hasn&#x27;t yet been introduced.",1454285465

But perhaps the <i>very first language to ever be invented</i> will rely on many different sounds and on many different words made from those sounds, but have a simple grammar. A recent study showed the likely dispersal of language from an initial point somewhere in Africa by counting the phonemic diversity, i.e. number of different speech sounds, in various languages around the world. [1] Perhaps the very first language had over a hundred different sounds to compensate for lack of grammar rules.<p>Perhaps a chin is needed to speak that very first language. Perhaps it had far more clicks than Khoisan, as well as the usual array of consonants, vowels, and tones. Maybe a chin helps with many of the clicking-like sounds.<p>[1] <a href=""http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/human-language-spread-african-origin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/human-language-spread...</a>",1454285308

11008790,comment,11008046,11008046,0,0,marcoperaza,,,"The web is controlled by players who have shifting agendas. There&#x27;s always at least one player that wants to advance the web, because they are doing poorly in the native OS market (or some portion of it).  There&#x27;s always at least one other that wants to keep web technology stagnant, because they are doing well in the native OS market. These players switch roles as the market evolves. The power in the web is that once you have a critical mass of content that requires a certain feature, browser makers have very strong incentives to support that feature, and very strong disincentives to not support it (such as undermining their market share, and thus control over future web evolution).  Which means that progress is pretty much monotonic, but also very path-dependent. Hence why the technology is often such an awkward fit for its current uses. It also means that the web api will always lag behind the richest native apis, but that&#x27;s how all technology works, and must work if there is to be progress; the cutting-edge is always non-standard experimentation.<p>In terms of controlling presentation, WebAssembly, HTML canvas, and WebGL are conspiring to bust the monopoly of the Javascript/HTML/DOM model.  Look at this: <a href=""http://vps2.etotheipiplusone.com:30176/redmine/emscripten-qt-examples/kate/kate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vps2.etotheipiplusone.com:30176/redmine/emscripten-qt...</a> (takes a while to load, worked on Chrome for me despite warning). It&#x27;s a full blown Qt app running in the web browser.  There&#x27;s obviously a lot of kinks to sort out, like the massive loading times, but it&#x27;s not that far from being viable.<p>WebAssembly and the ecosystem that will grow around it (to some extent, this already happened with asm.js and Emscripten) are game-changers for the web because they shift the burden, i.e. developing for an inferior platform designed by a committee full of bad-faith actors, from every single app developer to the compiler and core-library developers. Of course, this will lead to inefficiencies like drawing with Qt inside a VM inside a web browser that&#x27;s itself drawn using Qt.  And so smart browser vendors will figure out how to optimize, thus some web apps will work much better on their browsers. This will force the less-eager browser vendors to improve the performance too. And so the cycle continues... This is actually exactly how WebAssembly came about in the first place. Asm.js provided a solution that worked on all browsers by brutally and inefficiently repurposing existing technology, but that could be heavily optimized by enlightened browsers.  One browser vendor gained a temporary advantage by doing this, and thus forced everyone else&#x27;s hands.  A binary format was just the next step.<p>I suspect that this dynamic is a general phenomenon that causes technology to naturally trend toward standardization and therefore openness.",1454285205

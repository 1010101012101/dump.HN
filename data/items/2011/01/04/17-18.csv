I like to see the progress that's been made and just to try something different for a while.<p>I am used to linux and have used it pretty extensively, and I enjoy it. What I find to be my main blockers are related to working with other people who are using OS X / Windows. I agree that this is mostly the fault of vendors. Skype and Team Viewer come to mind as applications that support linux but always keep you a few versions back, thus not having support for some features that the rest of your team is using on OS X / Windows.<p>Ultimately I just get tired of messing the little things that bug me with linux, that I know just work on OS X. It was well said by someone else in the thread that linux is a lifestyle and I can't agree more with that.",1294163954

2067805,comment,2067632,2067632,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Nice idea but as someone who manages technology for a school I can say tablets just aren't there yet.  A few things (that might not be apparent with 41 hand picked kids)...<p>==========<p>Damage: Understand that planning technology for a school is all about scale.  It isn't about ""Can we afford to buy this for each kid"" its ""can we afford to buy this for each kid and deal with a 30-40% damage rate"".  Because they're kids.<p>Remember the way you treated your backpack in Jr High and High School?  Now imagine how a $750 iPad would have done if you carried it around all day.<p>Most hardware companies combat this by either (a) making devices durable or (b) making them easy to repair.  The iPad is neither of those things.<p>Control: The problem with an iPad right now is there's no way to lock it down.  If a student decides to start browsing the Internet while you're giving a lecture there's little you can do about it (why do you think most schools ban Cell. Phones at this point).  It's hard to focus a class when their text book can also be used as a Game machine and Internet browser.<p>Software: The most obvious point is that Apple hasn't compensated for mass purchasing yet.  I should be able to have a ""Purchaser"" account that allows me to log in to each system and install multiple copies of a given software package.  At least the last time I investigated this option that process was a mess (At first it wouldn't let me pay for multiple copies of software because it said I'd already purchased it then it would lock me out because I'd installed it too many times and so on)<p>============<p>There were some other issues that are escaping me now but the bottom line is it's a great dream and a great opportunity for some startup.  But just plain old stock iPads don't work.<p>Edit: A few I forgot...<p>- Power: You either have to find some way to power them during class (which requires rewiring the classroom) or limit their use.  Plus kids forget the charger and use it as an excuse not to do homework or participate in class.<p>- Eye Strain: You'd be amazed how parents who park their kids in front of a TV all day will come back at you complaining they read a report that said extended viewing of an LCD screen is bad for the eyes.<p>- Updates: Since there are no over-the-air OS updates its a chore to update the things<p>- Kids Content: Since there's no way to lock kids out of the administrative functions of an iPad a few will just change the account to their iTunes account and start downloading media on it which causes all kinds of problems<p>- Theft: There's not much of a market for Jr High Text Books on ebay.  The same can't be said for iPads.",1294163722

If you read the explanations that came with the flowchart, they try to make it very clear that ""known"" means ""known to you"".<p>Also consider the context.  This was a handout to students in a first linear algebra class, that was meant to help them learn to do basic proofs on their homework problems.  Nobody expected them to be engaged in original research.  Any useful technique they needed to ""discover"" was very likely to be well-known to lots of people, including me.<p>Finally it is not clear to me why you think that the word ""known"" is superfluous.  There is a world of difference between the stage where you are running through the techniques you know, trying to find one that fits, and the stage where you're engaged in expanding your list of available techniques.

The simplest benefit is mediocre teachers will have a harder time hiding their incompetency, and all students will have access to the best teachers. When I took my algorithms class I followed along with the MIT lectures. My prof was okay, but nowhere near the level of competency of the L from CLRS and Erik Demaine.<p>More interesting is the challenge these things pose to the authority of the entire system of higher education.  What's going to happen when most top student at non-top schools get most of their lecture materials from someplace else? I can easily imagine a near future where most interested undergrad calc students learn from Sal Khan and only show up to class for exams. What does a degree mean when one student has done the exact same course work as another only for free? Autodidacts previously had suffered somewhat from lacking structured course work, but that problem is resolved. If you're motivated enough you can design your own education path which will most likely be more efficient than traditional ones.<p>The obvious answer for higher-ed is to capitalize on what OCW and Khan can't offer: office hours, peer interaction, working on a research team, and lab time. Unfortunately, universities are almost incapable of rapid adaptation to change (we still put on silly medieval hats when we graduate).",1294162793

It's almost like an anti survival of the fittest, if you are successful, less people in the next generation will carry your genes.""<p>One interesting scenario you should consider are situations where a researcher comes up with a game theory scenario that they would like to do research with, but the people who play the scenario are smarter than the researcher. The question then arises - can the researcher correctly analyze the strategies pursued by the players? It's an interesting problem for game theorists - the researcher might conclude that the players are making the ""wrong"" decision, but in fact, since the players are more intelligent than the researcher, they've actually seen nuances in the various options that the researcher did not see when the researcher first designed the scenario.<p>For a point of comparison, imagine 2 grand masters play a game of chess. One of them wins and one of them loses. Now give a recording of the game to a chess novice. The novice can obviously repeat what moves that happened, but can the novice correctly analyze the game and determine what the losing decision was? Does the novice have the skill to correctly understand whatever gambit the losing master was trying to pursue? Can the novice correctly figure out what the decisive move (or moves) was?<p>I do not mean to insult your intelligence, but you should consider whether the successful, intelligent couples ""in most western countries and Japan"" are in fact paying attention to nuances that you have overlooked? Just to throw out some random possibilities (I am not arguing for any of these, only pointing them out):<p>1.) the path to reproductive success is to make greater investment in less children (more resources per child, given less children)<p>2.) less children per parent leads to greater health for the child<p>3.) successful men who marry successful women are secretly (or openly) promiscuous when they are young and have more children than are recognized<p>Again, I'm not saying any of these 3 options are true, I'm just saying there may be game moves that the very intelligent are considering, which maybe you have overlooked. I'd be cautious about assuming that the most intelligent members of the species are making all of the wrong moves in the game of life.",1294162594

I feel like Lucid was the release where it really came of age, and everything started working beautifully.

2067645,comment,2066552,2066552,0,0,lkrubner,,,"""the actual make-up of cro-magnon brains""<p>There seems to be no agreement about what the word ""cro-magnon"" refers to. Possibly the phrase should be disused? I have frequently read that cro-magnon refers to the first homo sapiens who arrived in Europe. With that usage, ""cro-magnon"" is just a way of referring to us, a synonym for homo sapiens. But the phrase has other uses. Some writers continue to refer to ""cro-magnon"" as if it refers to some distinct species, different from us. But then, the question arises, which species are we talking about? Who is it related to? Why does it need a unique name?<p>As far as I know, the most exhaustive coverage of the various human species is in Ian Tattersall's book, Extinct Humans:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Extinct-Humans-Ian-Tattersall/dp/0813339189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1294160996&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Extinct-Humans-Ian-Tattersall/dp/08133...</a><p>Tattersall is among those who refer to cro-magnon as homo sapiens, and therefore makes the phrase ""cro-magnon"" largely meaningless. One might say, with greater clarity, ""Early homo sapiens in Europe.""<p>Having said that, I should add, there is no doubt that Neanderthals (I'm using the spelling suggested by the Google Chrome auto-suggest, which may be out of  date) were a distinct species, and that they had larger brain cases that homo sapiens. There is no evidence they were smarter than us. They never showed much advance toward abstract thought, which gives us reason to assume they were dumber than us, at least using traditional (habitual) notions of ""smart"" and ""dumb"".",1294161172

This is the most high profile example.<p>bsnes is the only emulator that lets you play yoshi's island properly, which happens to be many people's favourite game on the platform.<p>The problem is down to some games exploiting timing tricks in the graphics subsystem to achieve transparency-like effects and so on. All the emulators apart from bsnes compute the graphics line-by-line, which breaks these tricks. bsnes draws it's output pixel-by-pixel, like a real snes, which is much more computationally intensive.<p><i>""The reason is because while a scanline renderer runs at a mere ~15.75khz, a clock-based renderer would run at ~10.75mhz. That may not seem like a lot, but when you are writing an emulator that claims absolutely flawless interprocess communication, that means synchronizing two separate processors over ten million times a second.""[1]</i><p>All that context-switching makes your processor mad.<p>The main reason for bsnes is homebrew snes developers' need of a bit-for-bit accurate snes emulator. These people need an emulator that will help them test code they are planning to flash to a cart and run on a real snes. ZSNES and other emulators designed to simply run commercially produced games on their PCs are riddled with hacks and shortcuts, this is what allows them to run fast on low spec machines. However this means that they allow many, many things that a real snes won't, and are useless for development targeted at real hardware.<p>For more details, see byuu's many rants on the subject, the first of which is here: [1] <a href=""http://byuu.org/articles/emulation-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://byuu.org/articles/emulation-2/</a> (Bear in mind it was written ~3 years ago, a lot of the problems he mentions he has since overcome, the aforementioned per-pixel video rendering for example.

All one needs to do to rank his/her site high is to link to some authoritative/reputed site. Edit: One apparent fix is to assign smaller scores to outlinks as compared to inlinks. Even this is easy to game by setting up numerous pages to harvest outlink score, and then direct it to a page as an inlink.<p>Edit: Erm anything wrong with my comment ?

2067614,comment,2066084,2067370,0,0,Pomax,,,"This is the nature of floating point numbers: they're not exactually ""exact"" at all. Converting a fixed fraction decimal number into a floating point means turning an exact number into its best approximation. In order to get the approximation as close as possible to the original number, a floating point conversion algorithm will perform several runs until the error between the original number and the floating point representation is smaller than some very small value. This leads to problems when either the error can't get smaller than the required precision, or when the error doesn't decrease per iteration. In both cases an algorithm that doesn't have error detection will be stuck in an infinite loop.",1294160749

Maybe a lower cost hybrid program would work (to allow for better peer and faculty interaction) or at least the acceptance of an online degree.

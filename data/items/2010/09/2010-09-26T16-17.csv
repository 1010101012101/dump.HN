That said, there's some real brilliance in it, especially how Comet and Ajax work.  Lately, it's gotten a lot easier to work with, as the IDE has gotten into a usable state.<p>The learning curve is pretty steep though.  You have to learn Scala, The Java APIs and the non-traditional approach to web development that Lift takes.  That, and it's a young ecosystem.  There aren't 101 e-commerce shopping cart systems written in it yet.",1285520384
1729472,comment,1728993,1729156,0,0,poet,,,"This is a common misunderstanding. Yes, if someone purposely tries to release classified information they will face charges. That isn't what happened in this case.<p>In the defense industry, an author can write a book (or a scientific paper, or really anything else) and s/he gets it the content reviewed for release. The release reviewers are responsible for ensuring there is no classified content in the written work. It is not within the capabilities of any single person to vett a manuscript completely. Inadvertently including information that is classified is understandable. Hell, in some cases individual pieces of information are not classified but the aggregate is. Hence the need for the release review process. This is standard practice in the defense industry.<p>In this case, the release review was done incorrectly. The people on the hook here are the ones who reviewed his manuscript, not the author himself. Your claim that the author would be facing charges if there was classified information in the book is incorrect.",1285520378

I can't speak to the license fees, but to the folks that say ""build your own"", I don't really recommend that.<p>Not sure what kind of site you are trying to build, but aggregation is a really Long Tail kind of functionality.

1729465,story,,,27,33,stevejobs,"Why Groupon hurts businesses and you should be careful",,"I know this post will be controversial, but I stand by it nonetheless.  I think that Groupon and its ilk hurt businesses more than it helps them by devaluing the product or service they are trying to sell.  It emphasizes price (aka huge savings) as the determining factor in choosing to make a purchase.  Rather than win over customers because you have a superior product or service that is worth the regular price, the Groupon coupon shows to customers how much margin you have to work with and will anchor their future purchases off that initial discounted price.<p>What this means is that customers, especially new customers, will forever know that the stated price is not the ""real"" price, but a much lower amount even if it is in reality a loss for your business.  For example, if a service is normally priced at $50, and you now offer it at $25, your customers, even the ones who don't go for the deal, will now think the ""true"" price is closer to the lower price than the previous price.<p>They will resist buying unless the price is adjusted downward even if in actually you never intended for the price to go that low.  Moreover, these deals bring out those customers who prefer deep discounts and have weak loyalties to any one business that isn't giving them bargains.<p>While Groupon is a startup success, its long-tern proposition is questionable because it may hurt businesses over the long term even if it provides some short term gains.",1285520265

1729462,comment,1728523,1728742,0,0,flatulent1,,,"That would be an improvement over something some cable tv systems once did in small communities.  If a town had one nearby full-power analog tv station, analog signals carried on the same channel on cable would often get interference.  Even if the same station was carried, the differing time delays would cause the video to appear in different positions on a scan line causing ghosts.  In the later days, the channel would typically carry public service text, community access programs, or guide listings.
But in the early days it'd be things like weather guages next to an aquarium with the camera panning back and forth.<p>Maybe by 2012 someone can do a video with (Tina Fey) Sara Palin shown secretly hunting down the last bear in Alaska or something... chase a Russian bear on an iceberg and wrestle for oil rights?<p>BearGate, the Sara Palin conspiracy",1285520198

Finish your undergraduate, because in most societieis there's a big stigma associated with not having a college degree.<p>2. While doing that, assess yourself. If you think you've got the entrepreneurial balls, don't get a degree. It's a sure way to (slightly) higher salary but wastes time at a crucial stage in your life, i.e. the pre-wife, pre-kids time.<p>3. Problem is, you can assess yourself theoretically only up to a certain point. You've got to try. So, set a time limit, e.g. 1 year, start a company and give it a shot. Then, go back to (2) and reassess. Steps (2)-(3) may be repeated a couple of times till you converge.<p>I traveled the path of least resistance since (i) there was no one around to give me the above advice and (ii) I was in a another country where doing a start-up was rare at an early (or late) stage.",1285518618

In my opinion, the biggest value of a traditional engineering education is that you learn how to solve problems. This works very well in the software industry where X is supposed to do Y but does Z.<p>First year: Traditional coresciences. Physics, Chemistry. Very structured problem sets (well defined problems, well defined answers)<p>Second year: Core engineering classes. Statics, Dynamics, Materials. More specialized problem sets, less definition.<p>Third year: The hardest year. Labs, beginning of long-term group projects. Problems are now more general. Doing a homework problem now is much more difficult because if you get off track early - you don't get the textbook correct answer. Lots of engineering labs where you have to collect a lot of raw data and use a cookbook of formulas to write the analysis.<p>Routine now on tests to not solve many problems in time allotted. It's really a test of your problem solving process now. The point is you could probably solve all of the problems given enough time but in the real world you have time constraints so the faculty is helping you adjust your analytical skills to be quicker.<p>Fourth year: This is the year where you work on a Capstone project. Very big problem with some constraints. All the design is up to you. It's your problem to solve.",1285517855

9558777,comment,9556720,9558639,0,0,scrollaway,,,"Thanks for the sources.<p>> There are people who&#x27;ve aligned themselves with Gamergate who actually care about ethics in game journalism, and it&#x27;s a damn shame, because Gamergate is rooted in lies. If you really want to do something about corruption, don&#x27;t do it while riding the coattails of a &quot;movement&quot; that was only ever a wildly-successful troll.<p>If you look in my post history, you&#x27;ll find that I said exactly this a few months back. I&#x27;m convinced that Gamergate&#x27;s #1 problem is how the name is reused for everything and based on a hashtag (which makes it easy to abuse as a &quot;dialing my personal army&quot; kind of thing). Twitter doesn&#x27;t allow for intelligent discourse anyway, and encourages this kind of &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality. (Maybe you&#x27;re familiar with CGPGrey&#x27;s video on it, if not, I very highly recommend it: <a href=""http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/this-video-will-make-you-angry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/this-video-will-make-you-angry</a>)<p>The tipping point that boosted GG&#x27;s popularity wasn&#x27;t specifically the Quinn scandal but the onslaught of &quot;gamers are dead&quot; article, which was followed by more and more revelations (and I&#x27;m sure a fair share of them were false). The Quinn scandal was one starting point, but it could have been anything else.<p>But does it matter what started a movement, really? Because <i>right now</i>, the controversy&#x27;s is fueled by the people who stand to gain the most from the attention. Quinn is the least guilty of it, but if you look close enough, you&#x27;ll find that the harrassment claims are really just claims. Just the other day, one of those recurring names was claiming she had to &quot;flee to Europe because of the threats&quot;, and then when few-months older tweets surfaced about a &quot;planned vacation to Europe&quot; surfaced, the narrative changed. (Again, I apologise for no sources but I dislike giving those people attention - my email is accessible from my profile if you want to continue in private).<p>I&#x27;m sure they get their fair share of death threats but... don&#x27;t be on twitter then? It&#x27;s not just a horrible medium for discussion, it really encourages this behaviour. Anyone mildly popular and controversial gets death threats. Just like anyone mildly rich will find people asking for money.<p>I try to remain neutral, as I said. But it&#x27;s hard to feel sympathy for those people. The only thing that can be done about corruption is that people find out and talk about it, and that won&#x27;t happen without momentum. GG just happens to have the momentum.",1431838794

9558770,comment,9558455,9558643,0,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"> Except that PowerShell commands, &#x27;cmdlets&#x27;, are really just .NET classes that run within PowerShell, like Ruby and Python classes, none of which are the same as working with GNU or BSD utilities and other executables in POSIX shells.<p>That&#x27;s categorically incorrect and shows a lack of knowledge of both Powershell and .Net classes. But instead of me showing you that you&#x27;re wrong, let me teach you how to prove to yourself that you&#x27;re wrong.<p>Open up Powershell, type in<p><pre><code>     ( get-command get-date ).dll     \n</code></pre>\nThis will find the dll on your system for the get-date cmdlet, but any will do ( C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility on my box). Now spin up ILSpy or any .Net decompiler.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the GetDateCommand class. That&#x27;s a 400 line class, which according to you, shouldn&#x27;t exist (as cmdlets are &quot;really just .Net classes&quot;). In fact this entire DLL shouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>But GetDateCommand is one of PS&#x27;s simplest commands since it wraps DateTime (in CorLib), so &quot;wait! See!&quot; you say. But what you need to understand is that Powershell is built on top of .Net, .Net is effectively Powershell cmdlet&#x27;s &quot;kernel&quot; so just like UNIX commands communicate with the actual kernel, cmdlets are going to leverage functionality in their &quot;kernel&quot; (.Net whenever possible).<p>My point is, that no, Powershell cmdlets are NOT just .Net classes. However you CAN use .Net classes directly in Powershell. For example:<p><pre><code>     [System.DateTime]::Now</code></pre>",1431838591

When it comes to trash removal, the city already comes around once per week and collects whatever I put out there.

The contract calls for a &quot;strike price&quot; (the maximum film budget) and a delivery date.  If the producer and director overrun those, the financier has the option to invoke the completion bond.  The completion bond company can then 1) take over, or 2) abandon the picture and pay the amount of the bond to the financier.  If the completion bond company takes over, they may have to put money into the production, in which case they get all gross receipts until they are paid back.<p>A well known director with a track record might get terms like that.  Further down the food chain, the terms get tougher.[2] The bonding company watches progress and spending closely, and if the schedule starts to slip, sends observers in to monitor the production, and may take over before the production runs through all the money.<p>There&#x27;s an up-front phase before production, during which the guarantor reviews the production budget, script, and shooting schedule for realism.  This is where the real action happens.  The guarantor wants to prevent cost and schedule overruns, not take over production.  Completion bond companies are good at cost estimation; they see the full cost data for hundreds of films and know what everything costs.  If the producer&#x27;s estimate is, in the opinion of the guarantor, likely to result in an overrun, there are negotiations between the three parties. Either more money or more schedule has to go in, or some expensive or slow scenes have to come out.<p>This third-party check, by an independent party who&#x27;s on the hook if there&#x27;s an overrun, forces realistic budget and schedule estimates.<p>A completion bond costs 2% to 3% of the total budget.<p>If software development (especially game development) had that, there would be far fewer &quot;crunches&quot;. Remember, in a unionized industry, crunches and 1.5x to 2x overtime pay increase the cost per unit of work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.filmfinances.com/pdf/Completion%20Guaranty.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.filmfinances.com/pdf/Completion%20Guaranty.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.eqgroup.com/completion_bond.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eqgroup.com/completion_bond.htm</a>",1431837630

There are still limits on the total weight of the tractor and trailer (and fuel).  So,  the more you scale fuel,  the less load you can carry.  There is a tradeoff,  and it&#x27;s _not_ much more beneficial than where we are today.<p>Considering most trucks take a 300 gallon load out already.  That&#x27;s already 2,600 lbs of fuel or 3% of your total weight limit.<p>If we choose a low value for the average MPG,  let&#x27;s say 5,  then those 300 gallons of fuel will get you 1,500 miles.  If we choose a high value of 70 miles per hour average speed,  then it will take you 21 hours to deplete your fuel.<p>So,  when I examine this,  I don&#x27;t see a case for much larger fuel tanks than we have today.

9558731,comment,9557727,9558194,0,0,anonsource,,,"I think it is important to consider the motivation of anonymous sources. This new story, which seeks to elevate the role of the ISI, or perhaps just diminish the role of others, appears to have sources with interesting motivations. In particular, Hersh&#x27;s description of the primary source for this information does not indicate that they would have had access to all of the information described (both the intel process and the raid details, as well as individual negotiation points in the coverup). The amount of love for the ISI in the description almost suggests that he was put up to it by the Pakistanis. For example:<p>The suggestion that an ISI liaison traveling on the helicopter with the Americans &quot;guided them into the darkened house and up a staircase to bin Laden’s quarters&quot; is ludicrous. SEALs typically don&#x27;t need someone to lead them up a staircase.<p>&quot;Aside from those that hit bin Laden, no other shots were fired.&quot; This is to support the story that ISI was keeping UBL under house arrest there, and had left him to his own devices, so there were no weapons there. However, outside observers directly after the event showed that the place showed evidence of fighting on all floors.<p>&quot;Saudi Arabia, which had been financing bin Laden’s upkeep since his seizure by the Pakistanis&quot;\nThe overthrow of the Saudi govt was one of UBL&#x27;s objectives. This is nonsense.  Given the level of infiltration of the ISI, the idea that they could have kept bin Laden prisoner for six years, without a leak from their side even now, needs a lot more explanation. If that many people in Pakistan knew, we would have known, and we would not have had to rely on a walk-in.<p>Overall, the sense here is that someone wants to make Pakistan look better. The ISI does work with the US when needs align, but this doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Hersh clearly misrepresents Sec. Gates comments at one point. He says that Gates wanted to delay the announcement of the raid per agreement with Pakistan so that we could lie about it being a drone attack. He then quotes Gates saying that we didn&#x27;t want release &quot;operational details&quot;. Gates says nothing about a delay. This is not supporting evidence at all. In addition, the anonymous source had previously claimed that a drone attack would not work, as there would be no way to verify the identity. So the whole supposed agreement about a fake drone attack is contradictory with the rest of the piece.<p>I am not sure that everything the anonymous source said is false, but the one fact that I do have hands on experience with contradicts another element of the story. As such, I know the anonymous source is wrong on that item.<p>So what&#x27;s my motivation? It just annoys me to see smart people believe something like this...<p>The point is, this is not a criticism of Hersh per se, except in that he gives this one anonymous source too much credit.  It&#x27;s a story of non-existent coverup; a story that tells us there was supposed to be big coverup wherein Obama would tell us that bin Laden was killed in a drone strike a week after the fact, but a helicopter crashed and we had to make the Pakistanis look incompetent.",1431837481
9558730,comment,9558373,9558373,0,0,chroma,,,"In 2006, Christopher Hitchens participated in a debate at the University of Toronto. The topic: Does freedom of speech include the freedom to hate? The entire debate isn&#x27;t available on YouTube, but the segment with Hitchens is.[1]<p>Hitchens makes three excellent points in defense of free speech, including hate speech. The bits I&#x27;ve transcribed are in italics.<p>First, freedom of speech is really more about freedom of hearing:<p><i>...it’s not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard. It is the right of everyone in the audience to listen, and to hear. And every time you silence someone you make yourself a prisoner of your own action, because you deny yourself the right to hear something. In other words: Your own right to hear and be exposed is as much involved in all these cases as is the right of the other to voice his or her view.</i><p>Second, if you restrict speech then you must designate a censor. Is there any person or group you are willing to trust with the power to determine what you can read or hear?<p><i>Who&#x27;s going to decide? To whom do you award the right to decide which speech is harmful or who is the harmful speaker, or to determine in advance what are the harmful consequences going to be, that we know enough about in advance to prevent? To whom would you give this job? To whom are you going to award the task of being the censor?</i><p><i>Did you hear any speaker in opposition to this motion (eloquent as... one of them was) to whom you would delegate the task of deciding for you, what you could read? To whom you&#x27;d give the job of deciding for you, relieve you of the responsibility of hearing what you might have to hear? Do you know anyone- hands up- to whom you would give this job? Does anyone have a nominee? You mean there&#x27;s no one in Canada good enough to decide what I can read? Or hear? I had no idea... but there’s a law that says there must be such a person. Or there&#x27;s a subsection of some piddling law that says it. Well to hell with that law then. It&#x27;s inviting you to be liars and hypocrites and to deny what you evidently already know already.</i><p>And finally, if you censor hate speech, you must censor many religious texts:<p><i>Look anywhere you like for the warrant for slavery, for the subjugation of women as chattel, for the burning and flogging of homosexuals, for ethnic cleansing, for antisemitism, for all this you look no further than a famous book that&#x27;s on every pulpit in this city and in every synagogue and in every mosque. And then just see whether you can square the fact that the force that is the main source of hatred is also the main caller for censorship. And when you&#x27;ve realized this you&#x27;ll therefore this evening be faced with a gigantic false antithesis. I hope that still won&#x27;t stop you from giving the motion before you the resounding endorsement that it deserves. Thanks awfully. Night-night. Stay cool!</i><p>If you&#x27;re interested in that sort of thing, I highly recommend watching the whole speech. It&#x27;s quite possibly the best oration by Christopher Hitchens.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyoOfRog1EM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyoOfRog1EM</a> Unfortunately, the whole debate is only viewable with a flash player at <a href=""http://tvo.org/video/188405/christopher-hitchens-freedom-speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tvo.org/video/188405/christopher-hitchens-freedom-spe...</a><p>Note: I transcribed this about 6 months ago, but it seemed relevant enough for me to mention it again.",1431837460

A vision of a 500 seat open plan office kept illuminated by 4-5 heads at various locations around the floor.  Passing a much liked colleague, she asked me &quot;What does innovation mean?&quot; while pointing at a generic poster on the wall of a lit light bulb on a blue background with &#x27;Innovation&#x27; in large text and some scrawl about a corporate competition.  &quot;Well, doing things better, modifying processes, creating new ways to do things&quot; I replied.  English language was not her first language, but I knew she knew what this word meant and I felt a bit taken aback.<p>&quot;No&quot; she replied.  &quot;It is brainwashing us and my team to think change is good.  Innovation is just change.  And you know what, some things are OK.  We don&#x27;t need to change them.  We need to leave them as they are.  I don&#x27;t want everyone thinking about how to change this or how to change that when they&#x27;re perfectly fine.  I want people to do their jobs and document it well, not think about how it isn&#x27;t right, and change it to something else that is broken.  People could be doing their job, be happy, and when a real problem happens deal with it.  Brainwashing us to accept the next change in direction from our dear leaders.&quot;<p>This made sense, and has stuck with me, even several years later.  For those in Big Corp or other institutions where the word &#x27;Innovation&#x27; is thrown around with glee, it does indeed not mean better.  Infact, its meaning is probably closer to &quot;Throw (new) mud at the wall and see if it sticks, and in the process of creating &#x27;innovation&#x27; gain the opportunity cost of creating better documentation, going home earlier, or multitudes of other things, but say &#x27;yes&#x27; to change because it is masked as being &#x27;good&#x27;.&quot;<p>Think about what words really mean, and if they don&#x27;t make sense, there are much deeper problems with the people saying them.",1431837169

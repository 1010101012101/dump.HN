5773971,comment,5773831,5773831,5,0,antr,,,"I don't believe this post tells the entire story. Adwords (advertising in general) is just one part of doing business in general. Other reasons that might explain the trends showcased:<p>- Businesses have cycles, maybe the author is experiencing the end of his software's business/product cycle. An 8 year period is considered by many an economic cycle. I certainly don't use the same software today as I did 8 years ago.<p>- During the past 8 years the business of software has completely changed: distribution, barriers to entry, platform (desktop/web/mobile), etc.<p>- Profitable businesses tend, over time, with no meaningful reinvestment, r&d, etc, produce marginal profits equal to zero.<p>- What are the software alternatives to the author's product/service? 8 years ago Encarta was ""the"" digital encyclopaedia, today it's Wikipedia.<p>- Adwords 8 years ago was a nascent ad platform, resulting in low cost due to low competing bids, today it's ""the"" most popular online ad platform.<p>These are just a few reasons behind these trends. Any other thoughts?",1369645180

Thing like bids, keywords, ad text can progressively put you in a worse place than the competition left unchecked. I addition over the years we are getting bombarded with new Adwords features that your competition is likely across.<p>The other thing I would say is that from first glance your software and site design may be the cause for the decline. People are used to the instant gratification from a web app vs having to download, whereas when you started people wouldn't blink an eye at having to download software. The trend these days is to pair you landing page down to the key point and call to action.<p>The good thing about all that is that there is probably a lot you can do with landing page A/B testing and possibly on the ads themselves to turn it around.",1369645070

My agency sold them bespoke development, and their UX (both administration and end-user) should honestly be better than this, and adjust to their needs, not the other way.<p>4) Jesus Drupal makes deviating from the beaten path miserable, but it pays well and I've gotten good at it now so I guess I'll keep on truckin'.<p>5) Breakdown. Giving into the evidence that it seems easier to build up from a framework with nice tools and decent libraries than to chisel away at awkward building blocks, even free ones.<p>Currently though, cleaning up messes and adding missing polish to Drupal projects created by people who are still at step 1 is continuing to be a financially responsible decision.<p>Drupal's building blocks though, do have two important uses:<p>They give developers who have no right to be coding a way to be productive, and the people who employ them some insurance. Brogrammer gutter rails.<p>There are truly miserable projects that shouldn't have budgets to do bespoke development and have nothing at all unique about them, that can be built in Drupal with zero code.

It's a graphical and mathematically light introduction to many of the areas in which fractals / space-filling curves intersect with programming, even if it's not explicitly pointed out.<p>For example, on their page covering Node-Replacement Curves[1], they mention both Hilbert Curves and Z-Order Curves. They don't describe them heavily there, but they're used in many spatial databases to allow for efficient indexing of two or more dimensional data.<p>Google Maps[2] for example uses Hilbert Curves internally to allow for fast querying of queries such as ""shops within 5km of your house"". They've also open sourced numerous libraries that perform these calculations[3][4].<p>The book interface itself is also quite nice, though I still prefer the PDF copy you can get by hitting the Information button (i) on the top right.<p>Edit: Wow.

The latter is communication barriers, culture etc, whatever, it happens a lot though. My friends are really desperate from work, unable to provide the higher quality requested by companies in the west while, on the other hand, also unable to provide the prices which makes lower quality attractive (to some).<p>I'm more into software development than manufacturing, but I would assume similar (and other) cracks are appearing in China as well. Especially with cheap(er) robots (also used in the west) and optimized factory processes.<p>Do you know examples, besides these inventors which are (probably) exceptions, of Chinese passion/energy attacks?

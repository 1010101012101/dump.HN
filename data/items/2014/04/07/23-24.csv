You set a pointer to point to one structure, then you change it and it now points to another structure or array. The compiler doesn&#x27;t know the semantics of your code, so how can it tell if you meant to do that? And malloc/memcpy is way too low to check this stuff. It only sees memory addresses; it has no idea what variables are in them. Tightly coupled would mean passing information like &quot;variable secret_key occupies address such-and-such&quot; into the libc, which does violate POSIX standards, and will result in lots of code breaking. I don&#x27;t see why we wouldn&#x27;t just write in C# or Java or Rust, instead of a memory-safe subset of C (and it would have to be a subset).<p>Edit: here&#x27;s one project for making a memory-safe C: <a href=""http://www.seclab.cs.sunysb.edu/mscc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seclab.cs.sunysb.edu/mscc/</a> .

A few nice features:<p>1. All cash flows which are non-optional from the borrower&#x27;s perspective are included.  This includes one-time registration fees.<p>2. The rate in annualised to make loans of different lengths easily to compare.<p>3. Advertisements must include the APR that 66% of borrowers who respond to that specific advert will get. For example, if you expect that a specific advert would generate 100 customers, and the resulting loan offer APRs would be evenly split between 20%, 25%, 30% and 100%, then you would quote 30% APR on your advert.<p>Excluding one-time registration fees from the APR and total cost illustration is IMO misleading if an ad is mainly targeting new borrowers.  The same goes for weighting the APR by loan amount, as this weighted rated can be far from the APR for new borrowers (who, because they are more risky, will get smaller loans).<p>I have no specific knowledge of your company, and my comments above apply equally to any consumer lending business.",1396914492

As such the rules that govern how markets operate can be changed to serve humans.  This is very easy to understand, wouldn&#x27;t you agree?<p>Now comes the question: does HFT serve humans?  Some people say yes, others say no.  Some argue that they add liquidity and thus earn their fees.  Others say no, they don&#x27;t add liquidity (since they tend not to trade during rough times).<p>Still others say they add negative liquidity: when the markets are plenty liquid they rob market makers of deal flow (thus reducing market makers ability to earn a living) and then when things get tumultuous they shut down first taking the extra liquidity with them and also having the secondary effect of fewer market makers thus reducing liquidity further.<p>Market makers are able to make money because of the uncorrelated order flow that they receive as market makers.  But there are HFT firms which are inserting themselves between brokerages and market makers, and paying millions for the privilege.  That means they take profits from the market maker and after receiving their cut, provide some of it to the brokerages originating the orders.  Is that good or bad?  I honestly don&#x27;t know.  I might lean towards it being bad since the HFT firms have no obligation to keep trading.  But they might very well reduce spreads.  And if they are reducing spreads there is value to that.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/brokerages-make-millions-selling-orders-to-high-frequency-trading-firms-2014-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/brokerages-make-millions-sell...</a><p>So let&#x27;s assume for a moment that they do reduce spreads (good) but they also reduce liquidity during crises (bad).  That is the very definition of what is called an engineering tradeoff.  What is your design criteria?  What are your goals?<p>Engineering tradeoffs are at the heart of why basically everything is the way it is.  Why are some cars faster and why do others get better gas mileage?  Why are some bridges built with steel and others with concrete and others with wood?  Why do some phones have a lot of battery life and other phones have a lot of features?<p>So I&#x27;ve heard plenty about how HFT firms reduce spreads, and many argue that it&#x27;s a good thing.  But they&#x27;re not an unmitigated good!  There are downsides to HFT as well.  Which should win out?  That&#x27;s more a matter of opinion than fact.",1396914122

The US has 300+ million people, whereas my country only has a few million. All communities are smaller here; interesting things get here later or not at all (with bad localizations) because the market is too small. Things are tinier, quieter and get less traction.<p>Another thing is that there is something of a cultural identity crisis going on. We cannot match the enormous cultural influence of the US, and so a lot of our culture is American. If you&#x27;ve ever talked to someone from Northern Europe and wondered &quot;why does s/he speak English so well?&quot; it&#x27;s not because of school. One half of our cultural identity is located on the other side of the Atlantic, and we keep in touch with it mostly through backlit screens.<p>The deluge of information and entertainment that has come from the US since it became a superpower has served as a really efficient marketing strategy.

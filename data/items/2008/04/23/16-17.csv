The best you could do would probably be to cache the most expensive queries.\nThe main advantage of having caching in your application is that you can cache your data in a more high-level way, i.e. taking into account the way the data is going to be used. So you can pre-process your data as much as possible and store the result of this.\nCompared to that a cache in the DB would be rather dumb. This isn't to say that a database cache is useless but just not a replacement for having caching directly in your app.",1208969198

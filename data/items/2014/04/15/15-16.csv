7592515,comment,7591285,7591285,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This, like the C64 compute module [1] would be a good way to get a good understanding of where the problems are. A long time ago when I was looking at parallelization issues in storage, I came across some excellent work done by Garth Goodson at CMU in their &quot;Active Disks&quot; [2] project. The was connecting what were essentially RPi class devices together.<p>What emerges is a sort of calculus for describing parallel systems which takes the amount of compute per second a node can do, the amount of data that node can &quot;consider&quot; during its computation, and the time it takes for all of the nodes to &quot;react.&quot; In this case a node considers a data structure when it evaluates its state (say the head node of a list, or the median element of an array) and is constrained from taking action by a threshold of assurance that the data it is considering it accurate. The reaction time is the time between making a change to the data and the time at which all elements in the cluster considering that data consider it true.<p>I used to describe that to people like those big mechanical train signs at stations with all the letters on a flip wheel. People look at the sign and consider it, it is stable and &#x27;true&#x27;, then a train leaves the station and all of the letters start flipping as the sign changes to show the new truth about what is happening. People with no knowledge are stuck waiting for the sign to settle down before they can go to their track, people with knowledge can be heading for their track but if the track used on their arriving train is changed they will be put in motion again. The length of time it takes to change the sign is equivalent to the time it takes for a cluster to react.  And and train station cannot usefully serve trains faster than the passengers can figure out which train to be on, nor can a cluster usefully process structured data faster than the truth of the relationships in that data can be ascertained.<p>It all collapses down to Amdahl&#x27;s law of course but along the way can help you figure out where the inefficiencies are going to crop up in the system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vintage.org/projects.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vintage.org/projects.php</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Active/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Active/index.shtml</a>",1397577474

In general, I suspect apps are going to be I/O or fillrate bound, with some additional latency because touch controllers aren&#x27;t benchmarked and are only starting to get more love from device manufacturers.",1397577459

7592510,comment,7592074,7592295,3,0,zanny,,,"&quot;plays nicely with hardware&quot; isn&#x27;t really an Ubuntu thing. Hell, some distributions like Manjaro and Mint play better with hardware by including proprietary graphics drivers on the disk if your system can&#x27;t boot on Mesa. Ubuntu doesn&#x27;t have that.<p>In my experience of Linux distros, Fedora, Suse, Manjaro, Chakra, Mageia, PCLinuxOS, all the Linux derivatives like Zorin / Elementary / Mint / Bodhi, Crunchbang, etc all do the <i>exact same thing</i> and do it right:<p>Boot ISO, get live desktop, have a launchable guided installer. There are only a few such installers, a lot of distros reuse them (but some still duplicate the work needlessly) and they all perform relatively the same.<p>The outliers are your Arches, your non-live Debians (the default iso isn&#x27;t live, for example) and your Gentoos, where you don&#x27;t get a live desktop and have to do the routine manually.<p>> one that looks decent (e.g. fonts)<p>I&#x27;ve been installing Suse 12.3 and 13.1 a lot recently because I find a lot of users like Yast, and I think they have gotten their fonts pretty well in order. They used to be the poster child for bad font rendering, too.",1397577422

In fact I need stability and there&#x27;s nothing more stable than a boring corporate desktop so...<p>CentOS 6.x&#x27;s Gnome desktop despite being considerably older is an order of magnitude more stable, works flawlessly on every bit of kit I&#x27;ve tested it on and doesn&#x27;t fall over on minor patches or kernel releases. I lost count of the number of times I&#x27;ve had power management and display regressions on 12.04 LTS. The only reason I ended up with LTS is because the NetworkManager VPN stuff that I need on my laptop is tied into later versions of NetworkManager which aren&#x27;t supported on CentOS at the moment. I will say that they don&#x27;t actually work on 14.04 either and I have to resort to manually adding a route because NM doesn&#x27;t handle default routes properly.<p>On my personal laptop (Lenovo T400) I binned Ubuntu and actually run Windows now because the PM regressions were unbearable and the battery life was shitty even with 30 minutes pissing around with powertop.<p>Yes comparing to bugzilla.

Hardly sounds like a &quot;leg up&quot; to me.<p>The Heartbleed disclosure was kind of botched, but in general things go more smoothly, with all the major distros being informed ahead of time and having time to prepare patches.  For example, see the Xen privilege escalation vulnerability in 2012, and the PostgreSQL remote execution vulnerability in 2013.  In both cases, Ubuntu was informed ahead of time and had updates ready to roll when the vulnerability was publicly disclosed.",1397577412

I&#x27;ve read (arguably) better explanations of how neural networks function, but the code was always either archaic or nonexistent.<p>To me, the ability to learn artificial intelligence concepts but also pass them on to others in a way that they can be tinkered with signals a tipping point in the field.<p>I would like to see all of the basic building blocks of AI (such as Bayes classifiers, genetic algorithms, etc) packaged up this way into an API that is as approachable as OpenGL.  Then I would like to see multiprocessing libraries like OpenCL/CUDA incorporated internally so that training can happen in milliseconds instead of minutes or hours.  With enough eyeballs looking at these things, we might be able to get from heuristics and rules of thumb for training values to something more concrete.  It seems like every time I learn a new paradigm it devolves into wishy-washiness because there are just not enough years in a researcher&#x27;s life to discover the subtle rules at work behind the scenes.  The progression seems to always be the same: failure to achieve success over 50%, then reaching 95% after some hours/days of tinkering, then finding the model hits a maximum of 99% and another model must be learned.  Rinse, repeat.  If that changes, and we’re able to link up various models without having to choose arbitrary constants, machine learning will have arrived IMHO.  We could throw hardware at it and let an array of agents evolve in parallel without human intervention until we see which arrangements work best.  Eventually that could lead to a theory of mind that actually works because it could learn anything a human could learn, for the most part unsupervised.<p>I’ve learned just enough about this stuff to wonder about the endgame.  I have a hunch that it will involve something akin to version control, so that an AI can try different approaches until it finds a solution, but with the ability to roll back in case it goes off the rails.  Does anyone have a starting point for things like imagination in AI, or trial runs that happen in simulation before the AI acts in real life?  And maybe how to merge new solutions into existing ones?",1397576749

This means highly non-local code.<p>Collision detection looks like a good example.  Okay.  Now even with multiple dispatch, I can&#x27;t suffer the idea of having up to n² methods, for n different classes to dispatch over.  In the case of collision detection, I would try very hard to have no more than 3 or 4 types of collision volumes.

Typically people are testing things such as moving the form fields above the fold, changing CTA colors/text, updating headlines, etc – smaller tweaks to an existing design, or rather, optimizing for the local maximum. As a result, fewer and smaller wins over time intuitively makes sense, as there is a certain point (a theoretical “perfect” page) where you can no longer improve a design. While it is highly unlikely you will ever reach that “perfect” design, the more you test, the closer you will get. If you are only optimizing for the local maximum, you could be leaving conversions on the table by not trialing “bigger” changes, or rather, optimizing for the global maximum (change to process flow / conversion funnel, introducing a totally new page template, etc).

7592223,comment,7591771,7591771,9,0,markovbling,,,"Being in the zone (lots of energy, ideas, inspiration, optimism, focus) is really a vague description for when your body is functioning optimally.<p>People who are depressed are given SSRIs (selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors) because your mood is largely governed by the levels of seratonin available in your brain. Similarly, your focus / &quot;motivation&quot; / &quot;drive&quot; is largely determined by dopamine. Acetylcholine, another neurotransmitter, is described by Wikipedia as having the key function of &quot;responsiveness to sensory stimuli, a form of attention&quot;. The neurotransmitter GABA is commonly referred to as the &quot;relaxatory neurotransmitter&quot; - the one released when you do yoga or meditate.<p>The levels of these neurotransmitters are affected by what you&#x27;re eating (and your body&#x27;s ability to process what you&#x27;re eating in terms of your baseline metabolic rate, digestive ecology etc.), how much exercise you&#x27;re getting, what you&#x27;re doing and even the thoughts you&#x27;re having themselves.<p>So, in my opinion at least, you could equate &quot;being in the zone&quot; with having all your neurotransmitter levels and other body mechanisms functioning at their &quot;optimal&quot; levels. What complicates this is that &quot;optimal&quot; is person-specific. So a person who is &quot;out of the zone&quot; and very lethargic could make themselves more &quot;in the zone&quot; by taking steps to raise their dopamine levels whereas someone who is &quot;out of the zone&quot; because they&#x27;re too over-active could become more &quot;in the zone&quot; by raising their GABA levels and bringing more &quot;calm&quot; to their life.<p>Raising your levels of a particular neurotransmitter can be done directly or indirectly. For example, you can raise your levels of the relaxatory neurotransmitter GABA by drinking green tea which is high in theanine which is the amino acid which your brain uses to make more GABA. Alternatively, and more interestingly to me, is that your actions affect your neurotransmitter levels too. For example, see the link below to a study concluding that a &quot;12-week yoga intervention was associated with greater improvements in mood and anxiety than a metabolically matched walking exercise. This is the first study to demonstrate that increased thalamic GABA levels are associated with improved mood and decreased anxiety.&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20722471"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20722471</a><p>I can&#x27;t really substantiate this and it might very well sound like hippie bullshit but I honestly feel that there are ways to live your life that are better than others. For example, I think it would be difficult to argue that you feel better if you spend the day outside than if you stay inside sitting at a desk in an air-conditioned office. Of course, you can point to increased vitamin D being correlated to improved mood etc. but I think we all have an instinct that certain activities are &quot;good&quot; for you (in the sense that they help you become more &quot;in the zone&quot;).<p>I&#x27;ve found the following to help move me more in alignment of &quot;being in the zone&quot; and move my neurotransmitter levels in the directions of &quot;where they should be&quot; for me to be in the zone:\n* 15 minutes of yoga every morning<p>* Omega 3, vitamin D and a solid multivitamin every day<p>* 40 minutes of intense cardio 3x per week (7-10km run)<p>* compound functional weights training (squats, deadlifts, pullups, etc.) for 40min 3x per week<p>* cut out sodas and drink at least 2.5 litres of water daily<p>* try not eat heavy meals at night (your digestion goes to sleep when the sun goes down) - eat your main meal in the middle of the day when your digestion is strongest<p>* cut out allergens (milk, nuts, wheat) and add them back slowly because you could very well be perpetually functioning beneath your optimal simply because your body is constantly in an allergic response state<p>* green smoothies every second day (kale, broccoli, spinach, bananas, ginger, coconut oil)<p>* 20 minutes mindfulness meditation daily<p>* listen to good music<p>* smile<p>:)",1397574739

7592220,comment,7591119,7591476,6,0,ralfn,,,"No! You are likely confusing it with best-first-search. A* is an implementation of best-first-search, not breadth-first-search.<p>Breadth-first-search does not prune a search space; it just sorts the search space based on depth. It also assumes the cost of every path is equal.<p>Example: Finding the shortest road between two cities.<p>With breadth-first-search, we would consider all connected cities, and then the cities they are connected to, until we reach our destination. We would end up with a route, that travels through the least amount of cities, irregardless of the lengths of the actual roads. We would get the most simple route not the shortest route nor the fastest route.<p>Feature: calculating using actual costs<p>To get the shortest route we need to be able to annotate road-length (as cost) in our graph. Using that information we can choose to expand shorter routes before we dive into the longer routes. We might expand A -> B -> C before A -> D because the cummulative road-length of A -> B -> C might be less than the direct road between A -> D. For this to happen we would constantly sort our working set, based on the calculated cost.<p>As soon as a completed route (to the destination) is at the top of our working set, we can stop and deliver the answer.<p>Optimization: Pruning<p>Now, this working set, gets larger with every iteration. If we were to search for the shortest route from A -> D and the answer would be 100 miles, than the working set will contain all routes from A to anywhere, that are less than a 100 miles.<p>This is very expensive in terms of memory and time: we need to prune the search space. Now, our working set is already sorted based on cost. So we can safely remove every route that ends in the same place as a route above it in the working set. In other words, if A -> B -> C is higher in the working set than A -> D -> C, than we remove A -> D -> C. We simply don&#x27;t have to expand routes from the same origin twice.<p>Optimization: using a lower bound<p>If the costs are truly unpredictable, and we want a perfect answer, this is the best we can do. But costs are rarely unpredictable! Can we provide a lower bound? Sure! Let&#x27;s use the geospatial distance between two cities. No road is shorter, than the actual distance between the cities.<p>In this scenario, the costs of our working-set would be calculated as the actual costs of the partial route plus the lower bound. So, the cost of A -> B -> C would be calculated as the actual road length from A upto C plus the distance from C to the destination.<p>Now this impacts the sorting of the working set. Which is why it is so important it is a lower bound and not an estimate. Because as soon a completed route is at the top of our working-set we call it quits, and deliver the answer.<p>In a nutshell: A* is a best-first-search that is capable of utilizing a lower bound to sort the search space. It&#x27;s behavior is far removed from breadth-first-search.",1397574727

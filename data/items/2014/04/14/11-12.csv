You&#x27;re telling me that Apple with their walled garden was without lock-in and that they won on quality?<p>What you&#x27;re describing are large leaps. Large leaps can&#x27;t happen constantly. I feel there is quite literally a hard limit to what leaps you can make, in one domain (basically low hanging versus high hanging fruits). Compare Chrome to Firefox to when it was when it came out, and compare it now. The difference has evaporated. On the other hand Chrome has steadily gained user base at a very high rate. It&#x27;s delusional to thing it was only made on basis of having a good product.

As a software engineer, I can sympathize with that.<p>But as a user, I prefer Safari, because I find that it prioritizes user experience over fidelity to the web page. Examples:<p>1. Safari was one of the first browsers to ship with a popup blocker<p>2. Safari defaults to blocking third party cookies<p>3. Safari Reader cuts out distracting ads and other crap, improving nearly every article. I click it whenever I can.<p>4. Safari Power Saver defeats annoying animations while saving battery life<p>I love that Apple is able to deliver features like these, because their fortunes are not tied to advertising.<p>I also strongly dispute that Safari is slower. For example, I visited cnn.com with Safari and Chrome, and attempted to scroll while the page loads. Safari scrolls responsively, while Chrome and Firefox stutter until the page finishes loading. Things like scrolling performance have a much bigger impact on how my browser feels than any JavaScript benchmark.<p>It&#x27;s true that some websites don&#x27;t work well in Safari, especially HTML5 games. For pages where I want to see that stuff in action, I&#x27;ll switch to Chrome. But frankly, most web pages are made more usable by disabling newer features. Chrome then becomes a poor man&#x27;s opt-in.",1397474676

Perhaps I&#x27;m being slightly too liberal with my use of the word rote. But by &quot;rote programming&quot;, I mean the sort that requires no understanding of anything beyond CS1 concepts, the domain and your toolset. The programs are very simple and sometimes hacky, but get the job done (e.g. &quot;Move all those files over there and then watermark them using this snippet I found on SO and then add them to the database so they show up on the website&quot;).<p>2. Even for many professional software engineers, often times most of the critical thinking is probably about the domain as opposed to the programming. Most people aren&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t be) coming up with truly unique algorithms/approaches; rather, they are mapping new problems to tried-and-true techniques usually already implemented as libraries.<p>So it&#x27;s possible to solve new problems (in the sense of your domain) with rote programming (of the sort described above), if all the critical thinking is about modeling the domain as opposed to the software.<p>Of course, every once in while, the &quot;tried and true&quot; technique is a piece of CS that only an educated engineer has heard about/knows how to correctly use. But my point was that there are lots of problems you can solve without getting to this level.",1397474353

I do think they solving a genuine problem in the supporting startup ecosystem, particularly in the UK.<p>I spent a year at MIT and it was hard to avoid people that were working on cool ideas and starting up. Students chose most of their classes, and each class generally had a culture of creating something in a project. As a result, a lot of students would experience working on building something cool with a variety of people. That, combined with a very supportive environment, meant that it was much more accessible to startup if you wanted to.<p>In the UK (or at least Cambridge) there are fewer people considering creating a startup. The UK university system also places more focus on end-of-year exams rather than project work. It&#x27;s harder to come across finding the right combination of people, ideas and motivations that is needed to create a startup. Most ‘entrepreneurial’ societies tend to be full of the bullshitty types and smartest people default to jobs in finance or consulting.<p>So it&#x27;s partly bringing together smart people, partly the legitimacy of not feeling the need to go into a corporate job ourselves, that I think make ideas like EF broadly work. That being said, the model still has its problems. Forming teams with people you&#x27;ve no prior experience of only works in a handful of cases. Thankfully the programme is long enough to try several combinations of teams. Even so, I believe all the people that have gone through it but haven&#x27;t ended up continuing with a company (like me) still value the contacts and learning experience thoroughly.<p><i>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve just finished EF as part of their 2013 cohort.</i>",1397474020

It&#x27;s a particularly poor example to choose to try and make the point.<p>The problem with communism isn&#x27;t that so many of it&#x27;s services are nationalized, it&#x27;s that one-party politics leads to an ossified, excessively powerful, corrupt bureaucracy with no checks and balances.<p>Any political system that lacks dynamism and protects cronyism would suffer the same problems, regardless of it&#x27;s ideological base. That&#x27;s why in practice Fascism and Communism produce functionally indistinguishable resultant states.",1397473406

It&#x27;s really liberating to be able to work inside such a tight feedback loop, and it&#x27;s a little weird to see a modern game engine distancing itself from that approach.<p>(But maybe I&#x27;m missing something. What exactly is the role of the Unreal Editor in UE4? Is it mostly for things like graphics and sound?)<p>EDIT: OK, so apparently UE4 has something called Blueprints. I&#x27;m still not exactly sure what they are, but people in the thread are saying that they&#x27;re superior to C# in Unity, and that they can even allow you to make a game without knowing how to program. So why is Tim Sweeney saying that C++ is replacing UnrealScript for gameplay code?",1397473308

I think Unity did it quite clever in that the engine itself is c/c++ and all the interfacing with the engine is done through C#/Mono.",1397473254

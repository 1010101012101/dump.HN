It's a 1 or 0 proposition.<p>Design on the other hand is full of subjective opinions from the client and even the designer that get in the way of defining what the intended result is. Worse, the only way to get close to that definition is to explore lots of different designs.<p>The process may look something like this:<p>1. client wants logo, gives the idea of spaceship\n2. designer sketches 3 spaceships\n3. client says he wanted the shuttle discovery\n4. designer sketches up the space shuttle discovery\n5. client says he wanted the moon in the background\n6. designer adds the moon to the background\n7. client signs off on sketch\n8. designer renders sketch\n9. client says saturn would be much better than the moon\n10. designer changes moon to saturn\n11. client says he thought space shouldn't be blue-black, it should be black.\n12. designer makes space black\n13. client says they've rethought the whole concept and need a daisy instead of the space shuttle.<p>And that would be an easy client.

396926,comment,395970,396894,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Each slot machine has its own independent RNG. Even if they shared one, it's still an RNG. Many forms of gambling involve skill. For instance, I can achieve a higher return (though still negative) at a craps table than your average Vegas gambler because I know which bets pay the best odds. That doesn't make them any less gambling.<p>How much skill vs. chance constitutes gambling varies from state to state. But no state would define a system in which there is no random element as gambling. If the outcome is 100% the result of the actions of the ""betters"" it's clearly a game of skill. (If it's based on the actions of third party humans and contests, it's usually illegal, such as betting on sports or elections).<p>Interestingly, in many states instant bingo machines are legal games of skill due to that very reason. They look and feel just like a slot machine, but the payouts are predetermined, just like a box of instant bingo cards, so there's no element of chance, even though the person playing them has no idea what the next payout will be. States have been/are closing that loophole fast.",1229200056

The proportion of Americans who hold traditional full-time, salaried positions at medium-to-large companies is far from 100%. A health care plan is something everyone needs; a job is something much more flexible that we do to earn (notably inconsistent amounts of) money. Moving toward either socialized medicine <i>or</i> the libertarian/free-market model would be better for entrepreneurship -- relying on a paternalistic employer for access to essential services isn't even a local optimum.",1229199558

Welfare, and all other aid programs, should be available to absolutely anyone, regardless of income.  But none of these aid programs should result in the aid-ee receiving any form of currency.<p>For example, welfare should provide spartan clothing, housing, nutritious food, and that's it.  No food stamps, no cash disbursal, but a safe and humane environment that can help people to get back on their feet.  For those who don't want to get up and work, that's fine too, but comforts like being able to get coffee at Starbucks, or a big-screen TV, or a nice bottle of wine, aren't going to be provided by the government.

Coding (like most art I would imagine) is something you can really poor yourself into, take great pride in success and really be crushed by failure.  As a consequence, doing this 40+ hours per week takes out of you any desire to do it outside of work.

The more you did this, the closer you could get to having <i>all</i> of the original subprime loans be AAA rated.<p>For an example, say you had 100 subprime loans. You divide them up into tranches, and the top 86 become AAA, and the other 14 become something else. Then you combine this left-over 14 with the left-overs from other funds, and end up with, say, 100 of these lower rated securities. You then divide this set of 100 up into yet more tranches, 86 of which become AAA and the remaining 14 become something lower. Combine this 14 with left-overs from yet other funds, repeat many times, and eventually you can get nearly everything to be highly rated.<p>There are claims that some groups of sick cows had dozens of levels of securities built up upon them, allowing ridiculously unsafe stuff to eventually become AAA.<p>[1] Described here: <a href=""http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom#page6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfoli...</a>",1229198787

They&#x27;re pulling those elements in as a part of the growth of those structures, and the ratio of different gases changes based on the temperature.<p>EDIT: Looked it up, I had the gist of it I guess. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleothermometer#Mg.2FCa_and_Sr.2FCa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleothermometer#Mg.2FCa_and_Sr...</a><p>I imagine the techniques now are more refined than what is exactly mentioned there.<p>Semi-related, I got to take sediment cores from a Ramsar wetland while in South Africa in order to pick them apart for pollen to try and indirectly measure early-Holocene temperatures using the ecology as a proxy.

8166119,comment,8163801,8165879,2,0,whoopdedo,,,"Needing to maintain compatibility certainly prevented Microsoft from fixing prevalent bugs. The C runtime remained non-POSIX compliant for a very long time because applications were written to expect the incorrect behavior. Some of those bugs led to security holes that were exploited, yet couldn&#x27;t be patched for fear of breaking third-party software. That&#x27;s how we end up with redistributable runtimes as applications were told not to depend on the out-of-date system libraries.",1407805139

However, emotiv is by far the single worst company I ever dealt with. Worst product support experience of my life. Having bought one of those epoc headsets I have to say its the very definition of flimsy, a half baked buggy product with planned obsolescence and proprietary restriction built in on every level of design. Emotiv even censored their forum and deleted my username to hide how they totally fucked me over. I support the openbci guys they have done a great thing by making a open source EEG sensor kit but well they are being rather greedy in the marketing. A terrible idea because right now they need to build a developer community around the device. They should be giving these kits away.",1407805110

I think Peter McGraw&#x27;s benign violation theory partially explains this. According to McGraw&#x27;s theory, humor comes from a &quot;violation&quot; or something negative that is made benign. Comedians learn to take the negative and transform it into something humorous.<p>People also say that many comedians have a more realistic view of the harshness of life.

Extract more rent.<p>But Pravda says crop yields are increasing, so I guess I&#x27;m crazy.<p>-- Edit: here&#x27;s my reply as HN won&#x27;t let me post it:<p>I was once a Randian myself. I feel like I know what I&#x27;m going to read.<p>I began to question the faith when we allowed the top tier of society to become astronomically wealthy and the promised age of wise captains of industry and private sector innovation didn&#x27;t materialize.<p>Instead we got the economic la-la-land we have now where rent and property values are mysteriously holding at unaffordable levels as wages are falling and everyone is in debt.<p>Granted, we have a few lights in the wilderness. Elon Musk is probably the closest thing to a Rand hero I can think of... but wait... none of his enterprises would exist without government assistance. SpaceX is being built in close cooperation with NASA and with NASA and DoD funding. Tesla would have gone under were it not for a very risky DoE loan.<p>He&#x27;s an exception that proves the rule, I&#x27;m afraid. He also does not espouse Randian ideology. Honestly most of the greatest captains of industry and genius investors I know of do not espouse Randian ideology.<p>I have my own peculiar views on the subject:<p>I think capitalism and socialism fail for the same reason. I call it the &quot;big dumb money problem.&quot; It occurs when the concentration of capital exceeds the intelligence of its owner/administrator(s).<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to see how this happens in pure socialist systems. The initial round of investments made by a socialist bureaucracy are often pretty good: roads, schools, hospitals, universities, power plants, etc. But then the problems start. Those were all the easy, obvious investments. As they pay off, the wealth they create coupled with the increasing difficulty of the next steps forward creates a resource allocation problem that rapidly outpaces the collective IQ of the bureaucracy administrating everything. It makes a series of increasingly bad investments. Eventually the whole system collapses in a blow-off of cynicism, ending with something akin to the Russian or Chinese mafia states. (I have a brother in law in China. It is most definitely a mafia state.)<p>Capitalism in its pure sense follows the same course when too much wealth accumulates at the top. Individual capitalists rapidly find themselves in possession of pools of money too large for them to possibly invest productively. They solve this by delegating the problem to a financial industry not terribly unlike the Soviet bureaucracies of socialist states. This industry proceeds to make a series of bad investments (since it cannot possibly comprehend the problem domains it&#x27;s investing in) and quickly becomes gun-shy, instead retreating from innovative investments and into the realm of rent extraction. Rent extraction works <i>too well</i>, causing yet more and more capital to be concentrated into fewer and thus by definition <i>dumber</i> (relative to the problem) hands. In the end it blows off a bit differently... instead of a post-socialist mafia state you get a post-capitalist feudal state a bit like the universe of The Hunger Games. Everyone has to go into massive debt and pay rent forever, and class mobility and monetary velocity collapses. Innovation stagnates.<p>The optimum is probably a hybrid, a system that permits private accumulation of capital up to the limits of the cognitive horizon of those who hold it and redistributes the rest to achieve maximum monetary velocity. The ideal -- probably not achievable since P!=NP -- would be something in which each individual always held an amount of money equal to their knowledge re: how to properly spend or invest that money.<p>Since again P != NP and the answers are probably not computable, we will <i>never</i> have the optimum. Barring theoretical breakthroughs that redefine the problem, we will have to settle for bad as opposed to more bad. So I think a system with mild progressive taxation spent in ways that improve the lot of the majority is probably best.",1407802365

The analog radar data were recorded as a holographic interference pattern on photographic film at a scale permitting the film to preserve the signal bandwidths (for example, 1:1,000,000 for a radar using a 0.6-meter wavelength). Then light using, for example, 0.6-micrometer waves (as from a helium–neon laser) passing through the hologram could project a terrain image at a scale recordable on another film at reasonable processor focal distances of around a meter. This worked because both SAR and phased arrays are fundamentally similar to optical holography, but using microwaves instead of light waves. The &quot;optical data-processors&quot; developed for this radar purpose [2][3][4] were the first effective analog optical computer systems, and were, in fact, devised before the holographic technique was fully adapted to optical imaging. Because of the different sources of range and across-range signal structures in the radar signals, optical data-processors for SAR included not only both spherical and cylindrical lenses, but sometimes conical ones.</i>",1407802154

If you know latin, work on learning the current dialect/script -- you'll have a shot at declaring yourself a ""wise man from the east"" and go for the job of physician. I would be careful with the Prester John references, your mileage may vary. As one commenter pointed out, you should be able to make aspirin from willow bark and penicillin from mold. These two alone, plus hygiene, should make you a miracle-worker. Be prepared to saw a lot of limbs off. You could also be the first to use opiates in medicine, which could alleviate a lot of suffering in that time.<p>After 1100 or so, the crusades are well under way. Most of the nobles will be coming and going to the various crusades. They started in the Levant and ended up being next door as crusades were eventually preached against heretics. As physician, try to attach to the church -- they're on the ascent. Perhaps with some luck you can get noticed by the pope and end up with a (relatively) cushy job in Rome.<p><i>Don't</i> do the man-at-arms thing. You'll suck at it. <i>Don't</i> try for any kind of social revolution -- people were pretty tolerant during that time, but by 1200 the church was getting very sensitive about outliers. You don't want to show up on their radar. Stay away from southern France -- the Cathars were nice folks but trouble is on the way for them.<p>If I had the choice of picking a city (besides the Rome-physician thing), I'd go for Genova, Pisa, or Venice. Great cities with fast growth and more of an open culture. They made out like bandits transporting nobles and supplies during the crusades.",1231073035

419217,comment,418843,418843,0,0,Jimega36,,,"The way to monetize users should somehow be PERFORMANCE BASED rather than purely subscription based. Yes, subscription allows for great filtering of people..and yet, maybe it feels too costly at first (because the whole value/match is delayed to much later?). There must be a way to get money out of the HUGE satisfaction of finding the girl/guy when this happens - and this could complement (if not remove) the need for an entry cost to accessing the pool. For example, dance clubs make most money out of drinks (fun related) not from entrance fees (access to the pool of people). Maybe pay in order to go on a 2nd date? Pay every time you click on a profile (point system)? Pay a bonus when you find a match (how to prove...)? Do you know if this kind of stuff was ever tried or what do you think?",1231071773

I'm looking at hosting for a single Wordpress blog at present (well, actually, I signed up for a host a fortnight ago, they took my money and never got back to me, so I'm looking AGAIN).<p>But claims like ""Storage: UNLIMITED + 50GB!"" put me off a little. Aside from it being a physical impossibility, I don't even need 1GB of storage. What's Dreamhost actually like?

Because people only write about the drama.<p>If you actually travel to any existing country where there are small villages, you will see that strangers are always treated with great friendliness and respect. If someone walks in to break the monotony of your cow herding, your instinctive reaction will not be to kill him.<p>It's the same with robbery - there are a lot of stories about robbery, but in reality, human societies don't function when people steal a lot. It's not true now anywhere, and I doubt it was true back then. So robbery will likely not be a problem.<p>(Remember also, those who wrote history where those who rode in fine carriages, and such people likely thought a lot more about robbery than the common guy)<p>Warlords in the north did not have an information apparatus - you could live for a while before they would become aware of you, and even then the interest shown in you would probably be more benign than not.<p>Cleanliness is something you really would not be able to maintain. Imagine the process:<p>1. Wake up
2. Get a bucket
3. Walk a kilometer to the next well
4. Walk back holding 10 kilograms of water
5. Bath yourself with this freezing water (be careful not to catch pneumonia)
6. Somehow either invent soap or buy some expensive soap
7. Do the same, but for your clothes
8. Avoid being too close to any children or anybody who is in any way grubby, because they will instantly void your work
9. Be considered wierd for doing this everyday<p>Cleanliness is not that easy in a cold climate, and it's not that neccessary compared to a warm climate.",1231071252

As an example, CL has a function called ""find-if"".  It visits every element in a sequence, and returns a new sequence containing the elements that match the supplied predicate function.  (Think ""grep"" in Perl.)  The DOM doesn't have anything like this, but STP does -- find-child-if and find-recursively-if.  That means you can write something expressive like (find-recursively-if (of-name ""p"") document) to get all the <p> nodes in the document, rather than writing the traversal code manually.<p>I have used DOM in a variety of languages, and it only feels natural in Java.  No other language is crippled the way Java is, so it doesn't make much sense to use the W3C standard, unless you just want to port existing DOM code form one language to another.  (Standards are good for legacy code, but not so good for new code.)",1231070752

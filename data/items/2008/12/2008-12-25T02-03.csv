How will loading <i>more</i> regulations onto the system really help? Regulations need to get smarter, not merely more numerous.<p>The current answer of SOX seems to be to offload regulation onto the companies themselves, but above and beyond the fact that the regulatory burden doesn't really belong there (per the trickle of ""SOX is bad, mm'kay?"" stories you see on HN), increased self-regulation is inherently problematic.",1230173579

409336,comment,409100,409305,0,0,jerf,,,"Open Source radically alters the equation; when I build a system on Open Source, even though I may not have built it, I <i>do</i> own it. I own it collectively, but still fully individually, in a way that really only works for software. As a home user I don't find myself fiddling with source often, but as a professional programmer building on an open source stack I do it <i>all the time</i>, and it is qualitatively different than working on a closed stack.<p>At PARC, I'm sure the cost of ""fixing other people's stuff"" was more than ""building your own""; a few hundred million lines of code later, that balance has changed a bit.",1230172774
409335,comment,408786,409113,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Alot of revenue is siphoned out of the urban, prosperous areas in the United States and sent to the rural backwaters. Flyover country receives more money from the feds than it pays in federal taxes, and the dense and rich regions face the opposite calculus.<p>Hong Kong imposes an 18% flat tax on its citizens. New York City could never get away with that, since its citizens already pay about half their incomes to the feds. Instead New York runs on a 3% tax, and I don't think the services they get from the feds make up for lost value.<p>If New York city got 15% more of its citizens income, hell yeah it could build a magnetic anti-gravity bullet train run off of angel farts. But it has its share to pay of pork projects in Alaska and troop presence in 170 countries.",1230172492

For bonus points, start sharing JSctypes-based wrappers between the two implementations.<p>Actually, if you're serious about JS-on-the-server, that's probably just about the most useful single thing you could possibly do to help it.

I'm all for learning from history, but there's just so many differences between the two that I'm completely unconvinced there's a useful comparison to be drawn.<p>Which isn't to say there won't be a collapse. Perhaps it will even be worse. I'm simply saying I don't think <i>this</i> argument has much value.<p>Certainly, if what he described was happening, rather than a run-of-the-mill recession, I would expect commodity prices to be rising, not dropping. Dropping commodity prices are a good thing for the economy; they were probably credit-inflated too.<p>Not to mention this whole ""five stages of collapse"" is really just an ass-pull, something this guy said to make it sound like he wasn't just making it up as he goes.

A dictionary defines it as ""by way of interjection or further comment"", which isn't really meaningful.  Maybe the name is a historical artifact?",1230171932

409322,comment,409058,409309,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I am curious exactly what you think democracy is, then. The combination of democracy with large bureaucracies is vulnerable to horse trading and power abuse, behind-the-scenes deals and favors, pork politics, and the like. Bureaucracy is needed to implement the policies desired by democracy, so there is really no way around it.<p>I think of some examples of well-run, transparent democracies in history, but they are all much geographically smaller, less populated, or poorer than the United States.",1230171504

Thus I 1. used existing tools; 2. built my own tool at the same time.<p>That's how I understand the term ""postmodern programming"".",1230170665

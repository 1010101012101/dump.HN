Arch (and its father, Gentoo) doesn't just not have an official policy -- the whole point of the distro is to <i>not even have versions or freezes</i>, much less support them.<p>Every Gentoo and Arch install is a special snowflake, with whatever the latest stable versions were when a package was last updated. Rolling releases are awesome -- the software doesn't have to ship in a goddamn box!<p>RHEL + Debian are constantly backporting and patching so much crap onto their 'frozen' versions of upstream software. For them 'stable' means that you get the pain of updates without any visible features, with the added annoyance of hacked-in patches from people who didn't write the software.",1248127184

Nor do I have quite the same degree of mental agility. What I've got now that I didn't have back then is experience -- the aphorism ""work smarter, not harder"" springs to mind.<p>Also: <i>why</i> work hard? Do you live to work, or work to live? That's a value judgement only you can make for yourself; but when you stop to think about it, try to separate out your personal feelings from the prevailing herd wisdom (which is that <i>of course</i> you must live to work, and anything else is somehow subversive).

I think people underestimate the difficulty of keeping conspiracies secret - and I think the difficulty increases exponentially with each new person who is a part of it.<p>One of the US's most precious secrets of the 20th century was how to develop nuclear weapons. There are theories that the atomic bomb was invented once, during the Manhattan project, and all subsequent countries learned how to do it through espionage - including the Soviet Union. If we couldn't keep that secret - a known secret, but still a secret - I doubt we could keep something as public as the moon landings secret.<p>Also, as a counter to your premise, consider acting. Good acting is hard. When faking something, it's difficult to be conscious of all of the things that you would do where you actually doing it.",1248127100

Water for human needs is not actually very scarce; it's just slightly more expensive than we'd prefer in some locations.  Even current oil prices are speeding development of alternatives, and there is a <i>lot</i> of shale oil to help us transition from cheap oil to cheap solar or cheap fission.  France has gotten most of its electricity from nuclear fission for decades, and exports power, so it's no longer a question of feasibility -- we know exactly how to solve our energy needs for several (current) lifetimes, and it will cost about what the Iraq war already cost to switch.<p>Basically, there are no particular shortages of anything that will necessarily be critical; the main thing we need to do to get over the hill we can see coming up is to stop braking so hard on the downslope of <i>this</i> hill. :)",1248126840

715290,comment,715265,715265,0,0,chime,,,"Submitter here. My cousin has not been doing too well for the past few months and so I put this project aside for now. However, a friend suggested that there might be many others who could benefit from such a tool or its derivatives.<p>This isn't a startup and I honestly don't want to treat it like a business. However, I do think it qualifies as a hack because of how it works. It uses Google Suggest in addition to a dictionary to try to guess the next word that the user is going to type. If you type WHERE, the next word is most probably going to be IS, THE, or DID. If you then select IS, the next word after WHERE IS will probably be THE or MY. KType uses this and a few such principles to make smarter, better guesses. It is not perfect but I intended to make it extremely smart and customized per user. When I was actively working on this, I had 100 ideas per day on how it could basically read the user's mind and suggest words and phrases most effectively.<p>My family and I looked at many existing systems for making typing easier but there wasn't anything out there so I decided to roll our own. As of right now, I don't know where to go with this because of my cousin's uncertain health condition. I would love to hear from medical and text hackers about developing this further.<p>Note: Currently I use Google Suggest localized for India so many of the suggestions may seem weird to non-Indian users. However, it's a simple change in URL to get localized suggestions for any country thanks to Google. Also, I wrote it for 1280x1024 resolution but it can be resized for most screen sizes.",1248126334

I suspect people who get accepted to CMU recognize its capacity for strengthening your inner nerd, and so those are the types who go there: people who can maximize their time thinking about difficult computer science problems.<p>AlphaLab, I presume the seed funding organization you refer to, is going about it all wrong. They are trying to be a copy of YCombinator, and I'll challenge them to a debate if they think otherwise. What they ought to be doing is being more open to the startup community at large to the point where all of the startups in Pittsburgh and all of the investors in Pittsburgh are in one room hobnobbing. So far I have yet to even have met anyone affiliated with AlphaLab. They had some lame happy hour kind of event at their facility <i>once</i> in the last few months, but I left when the director started to waste our time with a presentation which I could have (already had) absorbed via the information on their website.<p>I've overheard a few comments from investors here. One said something along the lines of, ""AlphaLab expects you to invest a couple million in some companies who give 10 minute presentations? Get real."" This tells me the adaption to the trend of angel investing isn't happening here. Another investor, when I mentioned the startups in Pittsburgh he replied, ""Yeah. There are not enough.""<p>One solution, as I mentioned, is creating the illusion of a startup scene. Just have weekly events and do what you have to that people will actually go to them. Don't waste their time. Carnegie Mellon has a Pre-college program. These are kids who end up going to UPenn, MIT, Stanford, Cornell and so on. That is, they are there because CMU is one of the best schools for computer science so why not get a sample of what it is like there. So, if incubators like AlphaLab actually helped the startup scene <i>seem</i> as though it exists, those Pre-college students may decide they like it and choose to go to CMU over MIT (let's say Stanford rejected them by chance) because they feel a strong sense of a startup environment.",1248125376

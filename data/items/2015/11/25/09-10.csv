Bootup simply reads the hibernated kernel state from disk and reloads userspace.<p>This is of course besides traditional full ACPI hibernation, which is pretty cool but isn&#x27;t a perfect art. (I&#x27;m typing this on a ThinkPad T23, a fairly old (and thus well-tested) hardware configuration; its hibernation/resume is usually rock-solid, but this morning my WLAN decided to get all stupid with dhcpcd, and USB decided that while it could see my external HDD, there wasn&#x27;t a disk inside it. From-scratch boot is still the only way to get a reasonably predictable system state.)",1448445582

Hardware is difficult because you could add/remove/swap it at any time, and software information is already partly cached depending on your OS.<p>IIRC, Windows a) builds a list of files to pre-load from disk based on your usage, and b) doesn&#x27;t actually fully shut down by default (it goes to hibernate mode: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/olivnie/archive/2012/12/14/windows-8-fast-boot.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/olivnie/archive/2012/12/14/windows-8...</a>).

It&#x27;s not much harder to find someone who has considerably more skill and experience, and will require at least twice that. Highly skilled people who know their worth won&#x27;t work for less than 2500 EUR/mo, and have no trouble finding employers who&#x27;ll pay them that much, or more. Google pays around 3500 EUR/mo for new grads. All of these are gross numbers, and refer to Warsaw market. For other cities, there are fewer candidates, and salaries are 20-30% lower.<p>Overall though I&#x27;d say that developers here don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;re worth, and sadly most employers get away with paying them less than they should. The reason it happens is that everyone else in other occupations are paid even less, so developers feel like they have it good, even though they can easily have it better.<p>As for the regulatory/legal system, there are some issues, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better or worse than anywhere else. There are some incubators here, Google has opened Campus[1] just last week, but I think the biggest issue for wannabe-unicorns here is lack of the access to capital.

I think most people will have here some personal bias, because they see the applications that they are working on, the applications that their particular industry is working on and think that the rest of world might be similar.<p>I&#x27;m specifically going <i>against</i> my personal bias. I write server-side applications, but <i>most</i> of the code out there is basically apps and such.<p>> And you already have given GUI as a counter example yourself. More then a tiny majority of applications have a GUI. And all major GUI frameworks are built on top of asynchronous abstractions, because you want GUIs to be reactive (no hanging due to blocking stuff), and because every input port (either from a human input device or from network) can change the shared state and cause output to more than one output device.<p>If you look at how the <i>users</i> of GUI frameworks write their code, it&#x27;s mostly <i>synchronous</i> code with some interspersed message-passing type code. The asynchronous nature of GUIs is only really relevant when dealing with button presses and such.<p>You don&#x27;t want to have to program all of it as if it&#x27;s asynchronous. Having to reify the stack manually into a state machine would quickly induce madness for all but the most trivial of GUIs.<p>Reactive GUIs are pretty simple to do using blocking code: Have a main thread resonsible for the GUI, offload long-lasting work to other threads. Use message passing for communication. Done. You&#x27;re still programming in a mostly-synchronous model. I think my point stands.<p>EDIT: Btw, the beauty of this message-passing-mostly-synchronous model is that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> force you to completely change <i>everything</i> in your program around the asynchronous bits. You restrict your asynchrony to where it really matters. That&#x27;s a big deal for clarity, IMO.",1448444831

10626252,comment,10623600,10625972,0,0,discreteevent,,,"&quot;Is Erlang object oriented? Joe Armstrong: Smalltalk got a lot of the things right. So if your question is about what I think about object oriented programming, I sort of changed my mind over that. I wrote a an article, a blog thing, years ago - Why object oriented programming is silly. I mainly wanted to provoke people with it. They had a quite interesting response to that and I managed to annoy a lot of people, which was part of the intention actually. I started wondering about what object oriented programming was and I thought Erlang wasn&#x27;t object oriented, it was a functional programming language.<p>Then, my thesis supervisor said &quot;But you&#x27;re wrong, Erlang is extremely object oriented&quot;. He said object oriented languages aren&#x27;t object oriented. I might think, though I&#x27;m not quite sure if I believe this or not, but Erlang might be the only object oriented language because the 3 tenets of object oriented programming are that it&#x27;s based on message passing, that you have isolation between objects and have polymorphism.<p>Alan Kay himself wrote this famous thing and said &quot;The notion of object oriented programming is completely misunderstood. It&#x27;s not about objects and classes, it&#x27;s all about messages&quot;. He wrote that and he said that the initial reaction to object oriented programming was to overemphasize the classes and methods and under emphasize the messages and if we talk much more about messages then it would be a lot nicer. The original Smalltalk was always talking about objects and you sent messages to them and they responded by sending messages back.<p>But you don&#x27;t really do that and you don&#x27;t really have isolation which is one of the problems. Dan Ingalls said yesterday (I thought it was very nice) about messaging that once you got messaging, you don&#x27;t have to care where the message came from. You don&#x27;t really have to care, the runtime system has to organize the delivery of the message, we don&#x27;t have to care about how it&#x27;s processed. It sort of decouples the sender and the receiver in this kind of mutual way. That&#x27;s why I love messaging.<p>The 3 things that object oriented programming has it&#x27;s messaging, which is possibly the most important thing. The next thing is isolation and that&#x27;s what I talked about earlier, that my program shouldn&#x27;t crash your program, if the 2 things are isolated, then any mistakes I make in my program will not crash your program. This is certainly not true with Java. You cannot take 2 Java applications, bung them in the JVM and one of them still halts the machine and the other one will halt as well. You can crash somebody else&#x27;s application, so they are not isolated.<p>The third thing you want is polymorphism. Polymorphism is especially regarding messaging, that&#x27;s just there for the programmer&#x27;s convenience. It&#x27;s very nice to have for all objects or all processes or whatever you call them, to have a printMe method - &quot;Go print yourself&quot; and then they print themselves. That&#x27;s because the programmers, if they all got different names, the programmer is never going to remember this, so it&#x27;s a polymorphism. It just means &quot;OK, all objects have a printMe method. All objects have a what&#x27;s your size method or introspection method.&quot;<p>Erlang has got all these things. It&#x27;s got isolation, it&#x27;s got polymorphism and it&#x27;s got pure messaging. From that point of view, we might say it&#x27;s the only object oriented language and perhaps I was a bit premature in saying that object oriented languages are about. You can try it and see it for yourself.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/johnson-armstrong-oop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/johnson-armstrong-oop</a>",1448443318

It&#x27;s widely considered &quot;one of the perks&quot; you get for paying e.g. self-employment taxes.

I mean, if people think <i>that&#x27;s</i> a serious privacy problem, then they shouldn&#x27;t be using any Internet protocols at all. I mean, you yourself draw the IP address comparison, so where do you draw the line? I mean, doesn&#x27;t it bother anyone from the so called &quot;FOSS&quot; people that cell phones regularly identify themselves to supporting towers?<p>(As a brief aside: I don&#x27;t like calling the FSF supporters in this particular case FOSS people. FOSS is a broad field and not all of it are anti-commercial zealots)<p>So this leaves me with a problem of defining what &quot;personally identifiable&quot; is. If it&#x27;s comparable with an IP address, then the argument is so watered down, it&#x27;s a non-starter. If you say that sending a random 128-bit number into the Internet somehow severely violates my privacy and degrades the usefulness of the software, then it&#x27;s wrong.<p>The reason why I call FSF zealots arrogant, is that they don&#x27;t seem to ever consider the needs of users, but rather try to dictate them. They assume some moral and technical superiority and never consider the possibility that people are OK with the proprietary software&#x27;s trade offs. I use Windows 10, OS X, and Adobe Creative Cloud among other things. Open source alternatives to those products (in my opinion) are shit. I really don&#x27;t miss literally days of configuration -when I used to run Linux and FreeBSD machines exclusively 7 years ago- and still being in a constant state of subtle, changing brokenness.<p>But it is a logical thing. FOSS is a philosophy, and not a business. Expecting it to produce polished end-user products is wrong: it is very hard and people doing it would like to get paid regularly, thank you very much. But that&#x27;s the economics of it. Look at Ubuntu: they start to move towards a more polished, more coherent product, they become less libre and more commercial. Should we criticize them for it? No.<p>So unless Windows 10 is tracking my bank transactions, I&#x27;m OK with it broadcasting a different GUID to the Internet now and again. If I&#x27;ll get paranoid about my privacy, I will buy a rugged laptop, put OpenBSD on it and start living in the wilderness.<p>And if people really want to commit to FOSS, then they should focus on writing clear and good software under public domain or MIT license and stay away from the cheap, patronising, rms-inspired politics.",1448442643

A namespace is what you&#x27;re describing: you want a way to isolate the symbols of different components from one another, but you don&#x27;t really want ironclad abstraction barriers. A module, on the other hand, is the unit where you really care about presenting a well-defined API. Sometimes projects call for one or the other, or a mix of both. You can always technically model namespaces as modules, but you end up repeating &quot;pub&quot;, &quot;public&quot;, or &quot;export&quot;, or whatever your language calls it a lot.

8046291,comment,8040226,8045976,5,0,fenomas,,,"Two separate issues. Pan-CJK fonts like Noto solve a problem that arises from the fact that many CJK characters are only ever used in certain locales. Since most CJK fonts are made for a given locale, they tend not to include any of the (many) CJK characters never used in that locale. Hence, if you render mixed CJK text in (say) a Japanese font, any characters that don&#x27;t appear in Japanese won&#x27;t render at all. That&#x27;s what (I believe) this comment refers to.<p>The Han Unification problem arises from the inverse case - characters that are used in several languages but rendered differently depending on locale[0]. For those characters, they&#x27;ll render even without a pan-CJK font, but the problem is they&#x27;ll render in a way that&#x27;s not appropriate for their locale.<p>[0] Another way to phrase this would be &quot;distinct characters which share a code point becaus Unicode mistakenly thinks they&#x27;re a single character whose rendering differs by locale&quot;.

Less R&D spending means chips get cheaper.<p>(2) Capital equipment will last longer because it won&#x27;t need to be replaced with new versions every couple years. Fewer equipment purchases means chips get cheaper.<p>(3) As performance/$ wanes, demand will fall in the short term. At first prices may crash if capacity is overbuilt, but in the medium term, production will stabilize at a smaller level than before. Because of economies of scale, prices will be higher at this smaller scale. (I believe this is what happened to the RAM market a few years ago.) This force may cause chip prices to rise.<p>(4) As software continues to improve, the value of chips will rise, even as the chips themselves stagnate. This will cause the market to grow, and economies of scale will drive prices down.<p>(5) As has been happening for years, the industry will continue to consolidate. Less competition between producers will mean higher profit margins and higher prices.<p>Overall, (1), (2), and (4) will lower chip prices and (3) and (5) will raise chip prices.

Anirecatam or oxiracetam are more expensive, but they're also a better value, because while piracetam is cheap, you're also eating three-plus grams a day of something that tastes like ground-up mothballs. (When the author of the linked article says, ""it'll probably have the taste and texture of sugar"", you should know they're either blissfully ignorant or pissing themselves laughing. Piracetam tastes like sunshine and gumdrops, totally!) Piracetam and friends may work for you, or they may not, but (as these things go) they're among the most benign nootropics. Either way, they will probably take at least a week of consistent use to have a real effect. (For piracetam, at least, that's often too much trouble, though gelcaps help.) I still wouldn't necessarily recommend them, but odds are you'll just find them boring and move on, neurons intact, albeit with a distinct hatred for orange juice.<p>Taking choline can make them work better, though for some people, racetams (alone or combined with choline) can cause major headaches. Regularly eating foods with moderate amounts of choline (particularly eggs) is a middle path. YMMV.<p>While not mentioned in the article, I've had good results with l-theanine, which is mainly present in green tea. (The sort of salty / MSG-ish taste from Japanese matcha and gyokuro is from high concentrations of l-theanine. It's an amino acid, and tastes very <i>umami</i>.) At the very least, it counteracts caffeine jitters, and if you're still reading this, you may already be taking enough caffeine. A bit makes me feel calm-but-alert, though IMHO there's not much point in taking significantly more than occurs in green tea already. I like green tea, but if coffee's more your thing, then powdered l-theanine is quite cheap - it's extracted in bulk from low-grade tea. It's worth a try.<p>I've also had good results from getting enough sleep and exercising, as lame as that sounds. (I like martial arts, weight training, and bicycling. Find something fun.) There are going to be diminishing returns from nootropics, particularly if you're sleeping or eating poorly to begin with.<p>Also: Vasopressin / desmopressin is a major antidiuretic hormone, so if you're experimenting with it, keep that in mind.",1269317530

1212183,comment,1209167,1211758,0,0,foldr,,,"I guess I'm not understanding what this ""catastrophic insurance"" is supposed to be. If it covers any medical condition that you might get in your 20s -- <i>without</i> charging enormous co-pays -- then it seems an awful lot like regular insurance. I can't see any reason why someone in their 20s would need less coverage than someone in their 70s. You may be less likely to get sick, but if you do get sick, you'll want that coverage even more than someone in their 70s (since you have more to lose).<p>>If everyone needs ""hundreds of thousands of dollars over their lifetime"" they are getting too much healthcare.<p>Eh? I never suggested that everyone needed to spend that amount. But some individuals will, and not just for ""useless operations."" There are plenty of cancer survivors who are in that degree of debt.<p>>Healthcare is best directed towards younger people, where it can make a difference.<p>I hate how the terms of the debate in America are so selfish.  In no other country is there any perception that the old and the young are somehow conflicting interest groups in healthcare. The discussion of this issue is a symptom of the bitterness, cynicism, and (frankly) utter insanity brought about by decades of buying and selling healthcare as a commodity. I just can't engage on this point; I'm baffled by it.",1269317126

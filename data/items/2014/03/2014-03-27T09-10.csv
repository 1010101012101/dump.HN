A typical procedure might involve perfusing the organism with a chemical that plastifies the brain, and then cutting slices out of the brain.<p>Besides the fact that these mappings are just tiny 2D recordings of a tiny sliver of the full 3D brain, they are not precise enough to actually simulate the neurons. The connections between Neurons, the synapses, are so tiny that you need extremely complicated microscopes to see them, and you have to be fast because the light from the microscope actually destroys what you are looking at...<p>And, of course, the mice these brains come from will have some genetic modification that makes their cells phosporescent so you can see parts of them better.",1395913733

This makes it easy to work with the standard UNIX text manipulation tools, which expect tabs and newlines to be the field and record separators.<p>The motivation for writing the tool was to work with CSV files (usually from Excel) that were hundreds of megabytes. These files came from outside my organization, and often from nontechnical people - so it would have been difficult to get them into a more convenient format. That&#x27;s the killer feature of the CSV/TSV format: it&#x27;s readable by the large number of nontechnical information workers, in almost every application they use.

The other, a real time list of US deaths.<p>The birth and death rates are low enough that most of the time both lists would be changing slow enough that you could easily keep up reading them, but high enough that you could see movement and see that the birth list is growing faster.<p>The death list would probably be the most interesting, as it would be less steady. You&#x27;d occasionally see blocks of deaths all in the same location as accidents and disasters happen.",1395911069

This doesn&#x27;t seem like an extraordinary amount, though, especially if we&#x27;re talking about using mobile phones instead of high-end gaming PCs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/05/01/esea-accidentally-release-malware-into-public-client-causing-users-to-farm-bitcoins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/05/01/esea-accidentally-release-...</a>",1395910930

Boomkat, Qobuz, HDTracks, you name it. These days I really can&#x27;t complain about quality music buying and streaming options.<p>With movies and TV on the other hand, you&#x27;re right as well. It&#x27;s a mess - even more so as a non-american. Even independent creators are doing it wrong: Tried buying the movie/documentary Teenage the other day - no download/buy option, instead screening in a handful of US cities. Good luck getting my money with that approach.<p>However there are also good examples like Computer Chess or Sleepwalk With Me, which let you buy a DRM-free download.",1395910870

Every pictured sign, from Argentina to Zimbabwe, is at the very least framed in red, and most are considerably redder than that.

I love to hear about how the Ops and Eng guys can run the company better but can&#x27;t seem to find a date.  A good sales guy is worth 100 ops/eng.  I&#x27;m not even a sales guy... My advice: grow an pair.  You&#x27;re either in or you&#x27;re out.  If you&#x27;re in, be in.  Support your guy and knock out the work your team needs.  If you&#x27;re out, have a heart to heart talk with the CEO and walk.  Sitting on the fence only makes your ass bleed...",1395910813

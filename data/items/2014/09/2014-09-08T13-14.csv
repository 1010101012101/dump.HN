8284673,comment,8284155,8284155,4,0,Stratoscope,,,"A couple of months ago Amazon changed <i>its own</i> price tracker to make it much less useful than it was before. I&#x27;m talking about the &quot;Important messages about items in your Cart&quot; that appears at the top of your cart when any prices have changed since the last time you viewed it.<p>They&#x27;ve had this feature for many years, of course. It used to be an incredibly verbose list with a bunch of boilerplate text repeated for every item, and the items were in apparently random order.<p>With only a few items in your cart this wouldn&#x27;t matter much, but I use the Saved Items for a list of things I might want to pick up sometime but don&#x27;t need right now. So I may have as many as a hundred items or more there. With Amazon prices fluctuating as much as they do - often by only a few pennies - it was hard to spot the more interesting price changes.<p>A couple of years ago they made some nice improvements to this feature on both the desktop and mobile sites. All the boilerplate was pulled out making the list much easier to scan, and the list was sorted in descending order by price change. So the items with the most interesting price changes were right at the top.<p>But a couple of months ago this list took a big step downhill. On mobile, the item names are no longer tappable links, and on both desktop and mobile the sorting was taken out! The list is still nicely formatted, but it&#x27;s back in random order again, so the items with significant price changes are hard to find among all the two-or-three-penny changes.<p>I thought this was probably just a bug, but now I wonder if it was a deliberate move on Amazon&#x27;s part. It seems they not only want to shut down third party price trackers, they don&#x27;t want their own tracker to be very easy to use either.",1410184105

8284670,comment,8282929,8283515,1,0,vidarh,,,"I grew up in Norway. The pivotal moments of the 80&#x27;s for me were things like going to school in 1986 and exchange dark jokes about the radiation clouds heading our way from Chernobyl. Or waking up my parents to tell them about the assassination of the Swedish prime minister Olof Palme. And Tiananmen Square. Hardly uplifting moments. And an endless stream of civil wars where the insurgents and governments where alternately supported by the Soviet Union and the US.<p>It was reflected everywhere in popular culture too: One one hand you had the excesses, but on the other you had the post-apocalyptic movies as you point out, and comics. I remember in particular Watchmen, which to me in many ways captures that feeling amazingly well. (I didn&#x27;t actually read the original when it was released; but I very much remember the discussions around it, and remember seeing the ominous front pages in the news stand as they were released)<p>Ironically, the Watchmen movie caught a lot of flack when it was released for the music choices, many of which seemed strange to those not growing up during that era, or perhaps not growing up in Europe during that era (though set largely in the US, Watchmen is very much British in sensibilities - not surprising given Alan Moore). But songs like Nena&#x27;s 99 Luft Baloons captured the feeling perfectly for me. A lot of the music in Watchmen was what I listened to in the 80&#x27;s when I was feeling in melancholic mood...<p>(And since I brought up comics, there&#x27;s of course Frank Millers &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;)<p>A lot of the light-hearted music and movies from the 80&#x27;s feel like shallow veneer over that darker undercurrent.",1410184089

8284648,comment,8283006,8284529,2,0,meowface,,,"MAC schemes like JWT provide message integrity and a form of authentication that can&#x27;t always be provided by TLS/HTTPS.<p>The simplest way of describing it is that with HTTPS, when sending data to/from a server and a client (the client may even be another web server) you can be assured no one but the server or client can see or tamper with the data in transit.<p>But the client is still able to trick the server, or vice versa, at the application level. To prevent that you need a message signing scheme (aka a MAC), and this is an example of one.<p>For the case of password reset links from an email, generally speaking there&#x27;s no point in using something like this; a one-time random token that you track and expire on the backend makes more sense. You&#x27;d only want to use a MAC if you need to freeze some kind of state in the URL and retain it, like perhaps a user&#x27;s IP address. Then you can verify that the user&#x27;s real IP address does indeed match the IP address in the URL; they can&#x27;t tamper with the URL to change the IP address if a MAC is used.<p>I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want such a feature for a password reset function, and you could also replicate that same behavior just by storing the IP on the backend as well (though while also perhaps making your application somewhat more complex in the process), but that would be one example of doing something like that in a secure manner while still letting the client keep track of the state instead of the server.<p>One common use of tokens like this is to defer state retention to all your clients so your server can do less work per request and store less data. Simply verifying that the MAC for a message is valid in every request is a lot faster than making a database/data store query to return session info for every request.",1410183840

One of NCD&#x27;s strengths is that you can apply it even if your data is not readily representable as a uniformly-long vector of numbers, whereas most other distance measures require this and it&#x27;s not always convenient to represent input data in that form.<p>For example, in this application games may be of widely-varying lengths. That doesn&#x27;t matter when computing the NCD, but I&#x27;d have had to pad out the &quot;missing&quot; values from shorter runs to the lengths of longer ones, or truncated long ones, or resized them all with some smoothing.<p>None of those seemed like particularly good options for this application.<p>Also, with time series (which this essentially is), most compressors are good at recognizing patterns repeated in items. That means that 0, 0, 4, 7, 9, 4, 0 is very close to 0, 4, 7, 9, 4, 0, 0 under NCD and is comparatively distant under euclidian, manhattan and cosine distances as the elements of each vector are assumed to be independent.<p>In short, your mileage may vary and will depend on the application. I like NCD because it&#x27;s super easy to throw it at almost any problem and get a quick understanding of how the data is structured.<p>The algorithms in complearn are slow.

This is probably flat when corrected for inflation.  On one hand minimum wage has gone from $3.80 to $7.25 which is barely doubling, then again the standard of living has inploded since then because virtually all expenses have increased at a far faster rate.  Still to less than one sig fig I&#x27;d say the market is vaguely flat when adjusted for inflation.<p>Then again I read this comment and went to the deli to pick up a breakfast and my banana, strawberry, and tea observations of people in line ahead and behind me, and the employees, and customers at tables, were 17 people, one rather gaudy gold mechanical watch, one cheap digital watch, three bracelets (one looking like a medical alert bracelet).  Two women furiously texting away (perhaps to each other).  One woman listening to music on her iphone with the iconic white earbuds.  One guy talking on unidentified smartphone.<p>My guess, looking at sales figures, is the market has dried up for anyone not willing to spend $2000+ on a watch, has exploded as conspicuous consumption for $2K+.  The Chinese only made 600M disposable watches for the 7.1 billion of the world population who aren&#x27;t 1%ers, and I suppose thats believable, if 99%er watches are value engineered to only last a year or two for $10 at walmart, I&#x27;d estimate I&#x27;d only see a couple in my trip to the deli, and thats what I saw.<p>If they could sell to 10% of the smartphone population, which admittedly sounds optimistic for a wristwatch with a 3 hour battery life, then their theoretical sales could be severely market disrupting.  I&#x27;m not seeing it happen.<p>To some extent wristwatches are another cultural trap.  Only about 1 in 40 people watch &quot;Survivor&quot; despite it being freely aired, yet its supposedly our defining influential cultural entertainment.  So wristwatches could very well &quot;define our culture&quot;, at least as we currently define culture, even if only low single digits of the population purchase them.  A play on words due to multiple definitions is &quot;don&#x27;t have to be popular, to be popular&quot;.  Or rephrased almost noone needs to wear wristwatches for us to describe ourselves as &quot;everyone&quot; wears wristwatches.",1410182813

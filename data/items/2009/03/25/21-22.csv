It'll do keep-alive also with XHR, so you get that benefit as well. You can also remove some HTTP headers in js to get some bandwidth optimization :)<p>One possibility you may be thinking of is XHR reuse, which is a pain in IE, as far as I remember there's a couple of bugs if you try to reuse the same XHR object. There's hoops to jump through depending on the state or something, and it's just more reliable to not reuse the object on IE.<p>At the moment, I create a new XHR object for each request, to be sure there aren't issues with IE (I believe XHR reuse isn't an issue on other browsers).",1238018390

Since this is being done in the cloud, it'll cost a bit of money to keep a game running - a company can't simply sell you the game, it now has to pay a bit for each hour you play. As a game gets older, it becomes less attractive for a company to support it.<p>Of course, I assume that the monthly subscription fees could cover it, or perhaps a pay-per-drink model, but I wonder what will happen to the up-front costs.",1238018064

As a player acts, that info is sent to the server and distributed to other participants.  If one user is experiencing (or intentionally causing) latency with this exchange of data, there can be what amounts to a ""collision"" in the state of the game. These problems are solved in various ways (i.e. jumping locations) that affect game play.<p>In this system, there is one central computer that is managing all happenings in the game and rendering out a unique view for each player.  There will be no ""collisions"" of conflicting information because there are not multiple entities creating and modifying game actions.<p>I imagine any lag would primarily be experienced as your character responding to your actions in a delayed manner or a drop of video signal. Both would definitely inhibit game play, but they should ONLY be apparent to the user experiencing the lag. A lagged user would just be a sitting duck for any other player, but not change the game play for anyone else.  THAT would be a huge improvement.",1238017755

With Tae Kwon Do I didn't have to think about ""a plan"". It was all pretty much laid out for me. First I get yellow tag, then yellow belt and so on. Having these goals is a great way of keeping motivated.",1238014928

Such dogma reminds me of the times of the 16th century Inquisition: no amount of evidence will ever convince the nutcase <i>warmists</i> that there MIGHT be a possibility that global warming is not caused by humans.<p>Dyson is a top physicist.

But we still get carried away by mass hysteria and delusion.<p>There's no place for politics or ideology in Science. Only observation and experiment matter. Dyson is not alone.

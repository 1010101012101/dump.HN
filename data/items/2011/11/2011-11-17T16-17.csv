Most people know it, many like it.  Though I find far fewer people <i>love</i> python than perl5 or Ruby.<p>But perl is still there.  It's still my tool of choice for most scripting, and for some fundamentally good reasons that are unlikely to change in the near future.  Perl scripts fit more naturally into single files.  They deal better with the enclosing unix environment (i.e. they expose things like signals instead of trying to abstract them).

There are things that you can build on top of Flash that you cannot do with HTML5.

These environments suck, but they are a real problem for developers that want to sell software to them.<p>Your third argument also ignores why many people like Flex.<p>Also, this very complaint about being downvoted by <i>Flex fanboys</i> ignores the possibility that you might be wrong in any assertions you've made.",1321548939
3248264,comment,3241704,3246018,1,0,stuntprogrammer,,,"Is there a cost? Of course. But arguably it's in the noise on these chips. Knights Ferry and Corner are using a scalar x86 core derived from the P54C. How many transistors was that? About 3.3 million. By contrast, Nvidia's 16-core Fermi is a 3 billion transistor design. (No, Fermi doesn't have 512 cores, that's a marketing number based on declaring that a SIMD lane is a ""cuda core"", if we do the same trick with MIC we start doing 50+ cores * 16 wide and claiming 800 cores).<p>How can we resolve this dissonance? Easy -- ignoring the fixed function and graphics only parts of Fermi, most of the transistors are going to be in the caches, the floating point units and the interconnect. These are places MIC will also spend billions of transistors but they're not carrying legacy dead weight from x86 history -- the FPU is 16 wide by definition must have a new ISA. The cost of the scalar cores will not be remotely dominant.<p>I'm not sure why you are concerned about the pin count on the processor, except perhaps if you are complaining about changing socket designs which is a different argument. The i7 2600 would fit in a LGA 1155 (i.e. 1155 pins) whereas Fermi was using a 1981 pin design on the compute SKUs. The sandy bridge CPU design is a fine one. The GPU is rapidly improving (e.g. ivy bridge should be significantly better, and will be a 1.4 billion transistor design in the same 22nm as Knights Corner).",1321548917

At least, you could structure an argument around that.<p><i>Thoughts on Flash</i> does hit a few worthy points, but many of them are flawed. Others have outlined them in previous mentions of this post, but I'll summarize a few of them again:<p>- <i>They play perfectly in browsers like Apples Safari and Googles Chrome</i> - left out a few other <i>relevant</i> browsers here.<p>- <i>For example, many Flash websites rely on rollovers</i> ... <i>why not use modern technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript</i> - pretty sure many JS menus rely on rollover states. There are other examples beyond menus, of course.<p>- <i>New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices</i> - except where you don't allow developers to select/take photos or files from the user's device (most useful apps have this functionality), giving the developer no choice but to develop a native app. I think a full implementation of HTML5 would include <input type=""file"">, call me crazy.<p>- <i>By almost any definition, Flash is a closed system.</i> - except when you can develop your own IDE, compile and package Flash code without any intervention from Adobe.<p>The anti-Flash mob like to bring YouTube into the conversation, as if YouTube is also anti-Flash.

3248223,comment,3246092,3246449,10,0,dxbydt,,,"I recently (well, a few years ago) went through functional programming in schools. They don't really teach you functional programming, as much as why you shouldn't program imperatively. Even when they're teaching functional programming, the consistent emphasis on only x% effective really cuts out student interest. It's almost like saying, ""yeah we have a method for preventing destructive assignment, but it doesn't really work."" While it might seem like a good idea at first, I found it to quickly invoke the I'm not listening anymore response.
Next, is the issue of effectiveness. Personally, I've been shown way so many gross images of imperative spaghetti code, that I won't even open vim without knowing I have scala. Unfortunately, this doesn't follow through for a lot of other kids who went through the same education as I did. ""I love ruby"", ""what about python"", ""it doesn't feel as good as C++"", and ""it's just too much work"" are all (yes I know it's sad) frequently cited responses among people I know.<p>Thirdly, and most troublesome of all, some people don't care that they're spreading nasty interoperability impedance mismatching in their non-scalaz libraries since they haven't realized that variance annotations are not worth their use in the context of Scalas partial support for Hindley Milner type-inferencing.<p>. I recently found out someone I knew was receiving treatment for coding in C. I asked her when she found out, believing this to be a recent development. ""I've been coding in C all my life,"" she responds. I walked out of the room. She's quite active in the C community, and her disdain for scalaz is legendary. How anyone can exhibit that kind of carelessness is honestly, beyond me.<p>Rather than force Scalaz, I feel we might have to take a completely different approach. Scala is great, but it doesn't work when kids don't want to listen or don't care. Perhaps we need to stress the why here, rather than the how.Why fmap, contramap and xmap are (far) superior alternatives to annotated variances and covariances on map, for example.[2]<p>Lastly - I know this is really aside the point of this article, but Scala should probably also teach how to properly code using pure functional constructs. Not using Higher Kinded types in favor of Pimped Types, encoding algebraic structures of category theory, understanding type theory, (truly understanding, for real ) the benefits of static program verification, attempting a high (read: extremely high) degree of abstraction in the context of Scalas limited laziness abilities, etc.<p>It's kind of sad that we learn all these things by exploration, again and again, generation after generation. I think it's about time we standardized it. Everyone needs to (well, almost everyone) use KleisliMA and FingerTrees one day, anyway. Lets just go one step further and relocate L3 programmers who don't understand (read:truly understand) applicative predictor monads, writer transformers lifted into a pointed functors and the Yoneda Lemma to a desert island in the Carribean and carpet bomb said island with B-32s until the last imperative mofo is subsumed by the dust. A Martin L3 is also known as Beginner Haskell Programmer. Might as well aim higher than Martin.<p>( Apologies etc. Dedicated to Tony Morris, my personal Haskell hero and Scala superhero

Another example is timing, apparently you can get bad results if you're not running the experiments at the same time each day. A third example is the way the mice are selected for the experiment, apparently you can get better results if you practice picking up the mice and injecting them with saline each day for a week before you start injecting them with the actual drug. Apparently there are even people who will sing to their mice because they think it makes a difference. Not to mention things like whether your mice are waking up to natural light or an artificial light being turned on, how much ability they have to exercise, whether you are petting them each day, how much you're feeding them and how nutritious the food you're giving them is, etc.<p>Cultural experiences was probably the wrong term, but basically what's happening is that large portions of the protocol, which are apparently essential to obtaining the results, can't actually be written about in the paper, meaning the results can't actually be reproduced. (Although if you actually look at the Rat Park experiments and think of each environmental factor in terms of the larger whole, perhaps culture is the best metaphor after all.)<p>And even if you completely standardized the handling of the mice, there are all sorts of reasons why they mice model is still dubious beyond the many reasons discussed by the article. For example, some researchers have reported a 'tall left-handed blonde effect', where the results can only be duplicated by tall left-handed blondes. I think this is why historically such a large percentage of our medicine is derived from plants originally used by shamans or that otherwise had a historical ethnobotanical use, and why even today so many of the most promising compounds are also things that come to the attention of scientists based on anecdotal evidence.

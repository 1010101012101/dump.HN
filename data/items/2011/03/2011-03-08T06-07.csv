The set of programs and commands for each are configurable by a simple XML file.<p>We're also leveraging WMI to monitor OS process creation/deletion events, and only run the SRE when a known target program is running to save CPU resources.<p>When Microsoft releases the Kinect SDK, we'd like to take advantage of its microphone array to do better background noise filtering. We also want to expand support to include browser plugins, as so many people now use Hulu and Netflix as their primary means of media consumption; if you have ideas about how to automate browser plugin UIs, we'd love to hear from you.<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how easy and high-quality speech recognition was with .NET, and I'd encourage others to experiment with it. We have some other ideas for how to leverage speech in desktop applications, but suffice it to say there is a raft of opportunity in the space beyond traditional dictation software.<p>Feel free to ask any questions about the speech recognition, process monitoring, keyboard simulation, etc.",1299567233

Companies play with numbers to make one set look favorable to investors, and another set look poor to the government at the same time so you avoid taxes.  For all you know, that could be the number he reported to the government for his tax return.  But there are laws saying you can't lie about it, especially if you have investors (public or private - linked a couple above).  Tax evasion comes into play because even if you have two sets of books, those have to tie out at some point, and if you're lying, there's likely some issue you're running into with the IRS.<p>I'm not estimating revenue.  I'm saying ~4.8M rev - (45 ppl * ~80-100K avg all in comp) - operating costs checks out to around the break-even profit.  Nothing more.  Both numbers could be fudged - I don't know.<p>Agreed with you that he has questionable credibility.  And I'm also saying that that could certainly be happening here as well.  But we have no way of knowing, even if we had the numbers in hand",1299565309

It's very difficult for a layperson to file a patent properly, in the proper legalese and keep track of all the necessary actions. This bill definitely opens up patents to large corporations and patent holding companies that can essentially throw teams of lawyers at particular fields.<p>After spending 5 years and more money than I'd like to admit on our patent that has still yet to be awarded I can tell you from personal experience that every response is cryptic, and the necessary follow-up actions are extensive and intensive. Furthermore, if they're not written in the proper legalese you have even less of a chance.<p>This is yet another boon to large corporations and their lawyers. Now that companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft don't have to worry about prior-art we'll see innovation slow to a crawl, and startups will have even less of a chance of disrupting the status quo as a lawsuit won't be too far behind. I can see it now, <i>We demand you shutdown as you're infringing on the patent we were recently awarded</i>, it won't matter that you were already operating. They can simply pay extra fees, get a faster approval and you're gone. This is supposed to be progress and improvement? Only to the lobbyists and their employers.",1299565278

It's also been demonstrated that if you take the same group of options to multiple similar pools of people, which ones become most popular will largely be driven by the somewhat random actions of the first few people to interact with them. Quality helps of course but a lot it is just being in the right place at the right time.",1299565213

The amount of detail and thought into all the aspects of the game are top notch.

The fluff - sounds, visual cues, appealing characters, would not stand on it's own merit without the excruciating detail put into the level design.

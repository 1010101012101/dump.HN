I'm very glad that by 2018, Germany will stop its coal production completely and not only because it is very expensive to get the coal in Germany.<p>This is btw something you have with all fossil and nuclear sources. With time it will get more expensive to get to the fuel needed. And according to the German government, nuclear fuel comes only partially from mining. So mining is currently not delivering the fuel for all nuclear power plants running. The rest comes from old nuclear weapons and other sources, according to the German government.<p>Also it should be noted that nuclear power was never really profitable. It might be with old plants now but with newer plants I think it is unlikely to earn a dime with nuclear power unless you get some kind of subsidy. The new EPR currently being build in Finland already costs 100% more than expected. With that money you could have installed enough windmills to cover those 1600 MW the EPR might provide.<p>Nuclear power was used for about 50 years, it will leave us with waste for the next 100,000 to 1,000,000 years.",1370432609

This shows up as very anomalous file system layouts at the block level. Simple visualization of the block allocations will show a clear delineation where the hidden partition starts. The TC implementation of hidden volumes is definitely not robust as plausible deniablility.<p>The police forensics investigators know to look for this already. It is in their recommended best practices for how to handle TrueCrypt volumes.<p>The safest way to use a TrueCrypt hidden volume is:<p><pre><code>  * Create the largest regular volume that you can. 
  * Create the smallest hidden volume that you can.
  * Never mount the hidden volume as ""protected""

Here it is.<p>After Hiroshima and during the cold war nuclear energy was associated with death and destruction. Hiroshima for obvious reasons, and the cold war because the population of the western world was constantly reminded how The Soviet Union had thousands of missiles with nuclear bombs pointing at us, ready to go. Western governments used nuclear weapons to picture the threat and to terrify populations into spending more on defense against the Soviets. There were scary videos of mushroom clouds, scary instructions on how to survive a nuclear blast, and scary stories of how a nuclear winter would pan out.<p>This, obviously, made people scared of nuclear bombs, and nuclear energy in general. Through decades the population was told by the government that nuclear radiation was the evil silent killer.<p>The byproduct of all this cold war propoganda was that people are now irrationally scared of nuclear radiation from power plants.<p>If you look at the numbers you'll see that nuclear energy is the safest and cleanest scalable energy source we've got. It's the energy source that has the fewest deaths per MWH produced, it doesn't produce CO2, etc. etc. Yet we think of it as getting power from the devil.<p>I blame the cold war propoganda for our irrational fear of nuclear energy.<p>Here's one of the old propaganda videos from the US, ""Duck and cover"" <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4MVJIU0gFk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4MVJIU0gFk</a>",1370430492

I put my money where my mouth is.<p>Having said that, in the mid-term I'm also pro-nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is one of the greenest, least polluting energy sources right now. It's the only technology that emits zero CO2 and can be used as baseload. All other technologies, be it CCGT/natural gas, fuel cells using natural or bio gas, coal powered plants, etc. produce CO2 and other GHG. As much as I wish the world run entirely on wind, water and sunlight, we are very far from this happening. Nonetheless I think it will be possible.<p>The main issue with renewable energy right now is its production volatility: the wind blowing, the sun shinning, dams to 100% capacity, etc. The need for a stable, non-CO2 emitting, energy production is nuclear. No doubt doubt about it.<p>When you negatively say
<i>> billions spent decommissioning nuclear reactors around the planet</i><p>implying that the cost of decommissioning is a big downside, let me clarify a few things:<p>1. decommissioning (from cleaning to storage) costs are priced in the energy cost, still making it far cheaper than oil and gas sources even without CCS technologies.<p>2. the cost of decommissioning is provisioned by the company running the plant, meaning that decommissioning is no extraordinary cost to the operator/consumer/citizen.<p>3. today's nuclear technology is nowhere as archaic as it was in the 70's/80's, when many errors were made trying out different technologies. Many people make the mistake of brining up the case of Chernobyl, but people are unaware that this plant was an R&D plant, built for the production of nuclear weapons, and not built for energy production.<p>4. the environmental impact of running nuclear plants today is extremely small (if not insignificant) compared to running the same energy capacity and production on fossil fuels, where CO2 and other harmful gasses are causing increase in temperatures, melting of icecaps, decimating thousands of species, and the list goes on.<p>I do agree that with you on<p><i>>The reason the world continues to pollute more than necessary for the energy we desire has much more to do with the irrationality of people than the physics of energy production.</i><p>There is plenty of educating still to be done on energy, its consumption and user behaviour, and I hope the anti-nuclear sentiment focuses more on the bigger picture, rather than blaming nuclear for the sake of sounding environmentally friendly.",1370430161

I doubt that. Define 'good name'. Also, for open source software it does not matter that much what it is named. Who would care if Python was named e.g. Snake or Juice or Foo?

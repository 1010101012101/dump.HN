The latter would, in my opinion, stop being an ""Air"" and be more of a ""brick"" in terms of weight and size. The beauty of the MBA (ok, one of the beauties) is its portability.<p>I have to admit, though, choosing the 11"" didn't come easily. I knew I wanted it for its compactness, but I was convinced the screen would be too small.<p>Do yourself the favor and challenge your assumptions. Go play with it. Especially play with it using Lion and its full-screen mode for apps like Safari and Mail. This is where the Air really shines.<p>To me the only benefit to the 13"" is the larger battery. Otherwise the 11"" is perfect.",1316185171

3004654,comment,3004080,3004488,3,0,barrkel,,,"Linked lists aren't used very often in languages that have easy (memory managed, or resizable) access to arrays, unless the specific characteristics of linked lists are desired. Arrays are faster for almost all operations for most collection lengths that come up in human-provided data (i.e. less than 10, almost certainly less than 100 - and in this case, tab pages, very probably only 3 or 4). And on the flipside, if the idiom of the language is to prefer arrays over linked lists, it naturally follows that you tend to want to clear such collections from the end rather than the start.<p>In terms of performance, another consideration may be important here: invalidation and redrawing of the UI. Controls like tab pages may update the UI for every modification of the tab collection (unless updates have been suspended). Removing from the end will look slightly more pleasant than removal from the start in this case.",1316184908

3004646,comment,3003717,3003905,1,0,rayiner,,,"Investment banking as an umbrella term is pretty useful. Investment bankers have historically been professionals advising companies on financial issues. If you're Ford and want to construct a new factory, you go to an investment bank which helps you issue corporate bonds to finance the new factory. A factory gets built, which creates jobs and products for the market, and Ford and investors split the surplus from that action, with the former making more revenue and the latter getting interest payment. Investment bankers also handle acquisitions, IPOs, and other generally useful corporate finance, generally non zero-sum transactions. In return, the bankers are paid a fee for their services.<p>The problem is that these traditional investment bank functions only make up something like 12% of the revenues of a traditional investment bank like Goldman Sachs: <a href=""http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Goldman_Sachs_Group_(GS)#Investment_Banking_.2812.25_of_revenue_in_2010.29.07UNIQ63d1795f1375455-nowiki-00000027-QINU1.07UNIQ63d1795f1375455-nowiki-00000028-QINU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Goldman_Sachs_Group_(GS)#Inve...</a><p>Most of the rest of the revenue comes from trading and other activities of questionable utility.",1316184844

And I think the answer is the MacBook Air."" - Steve Jobs<p>This seriously sums it up for me. I've recently moved a decent amount of my computing and my work to Apple hardware (Mac mini with a couple of hard drives as an iOS machine, Macbook Air as my usual laptop, iPad 2--still have the Windows demon-machine desktop, though). The Air was the last purchase; before that I had a Thinkpad X201, and briefly an X220 for test-driving purposes. And I found that I never actually wanted to use the laptop; it felt crippled and slow and all of these things when it really wasn't. But dragging the machine out, sitting down to focus on it--so many little factors started to add up, and I thought at the time that the iPad 2 was really a laptop killer.<p>Then I got an 11"" Air with a 128GB SSD, and realized that wasn't the case. I was pretty skeptical at first: 4GB RAM? My Thinkpad had 8GB. 1.7GHz i5? My Thinkpad had a 2.5GHz i5. It was going to be lame--I wasn't going to get anything done on such an <i>under-specced</i> machine.<p>Turns out it really wasn't a problem. I run Windows and OS X on the Air, and everything I've got, from Photoshop and Illustrator to Visual Studio, works just fine on the machine. The only time I've even heard the fans was when I was building coretools from MacPorts (because the BSD tools aren't compatible with some scripts I've written and carted around for years on my Unix machines). The smaller size of the machine seems to be a benefit in ways other than portability, though I'm having trouble really expressing why; I find I focus very well and am surprisingly productive when working on the Air, on par with, if not better than, my desktop setup with three monitors and every bell, whistle, and gong I could want. (It's not a Windows/OS X thing, either--I find I'm more productive in either operating systme on the Air than on my previous laptops.)<p>OS X isn't perfect, and neither is iOS or the iPad 2, but Apple has demonstrated to me, even in a short period of time, why they're in the position they're in: the Air really is the ""laptop competitor"" to the iPad 2 referenced in the Jobs quote above, and I think it does so fantastically (and I think that's hardware more than software--as I've noted previously, I use Windows and OS X on it in roughly equal amounts). I would have expected that it'd shake out that the iPad 2 would stay home, but the weight of the iPad and the Air together is barely noticeable so both tend to live in my laptop bag. It's a slick arrangement, and the experience when using either of the products--or both in concert; there are apps to make the iPad a secondary monitor for the Air, for example--is really very rewarding and productive.",1316184843

3004638,comment,3004080,3004533,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yikes. That's quite a difference in performance ... what I still don't understand though is, why? I've done a little bit of searching and I can't find anything so far on how JS arrays are implemented. Since JS arrays are objects and inherently support things like out-of-order indexes, non-integer indexes and that kind of thing, maybe we can assume it's some kind of hash map? A tree would make sense too, for faster accesses, and if a pop() on the tree meant removing the root node (and rebalancing the tree), then I suppose that would make sense, too.<p>But, honestly, for the majority of stuff in Javascript, I'd be surprised if some kind of hybrid hash-map / ordered skip list weren't being used instead. Ordered skip lists can be about as fast as a binary tree, without the costs associated with rebalancing, and a lot less complexity. You'd have some tradeoffs in memory usage depending on how you want to tune your skip list, but given the absurd memory requirements for modern software, that doesn't seem to be a consideration amongst programmers anymore.<p>So ... I accept that removing items from the head of a list in these higher-level languages is (a lot) more expensive. But I still don't get why.",1316184786

You end up with code that works, but is hideously unreadable. Declarative styles can help greatly with this. Functional programming can be a big boon here.

For a group that has benefited so much from the foundations setup by religion to attack the same is short-sighted, though unfortunately not uncommon in a world where the media increasingly paints religion using only the most extreme brush and leaves most people with a taste in their mouth that religion is something foreign and even repulsive.<p>There are three ways I see religion as providing us with a foundation that is so obvious and common that it may almost go unnoticed.<p>First, much of our legal system has as its foundation a codified way to enforce what started as religious principles. Contract law came essentially to bind by law a person to ""be honest,"" and property law to do the same with ""do not steal."" Much of our legal system has at its foundation these essential principles.<p>Second, religious groups are often the best at doing the small things that most in this audience would never see: visiting people in prison who feel helpless and without support, feeding the homeless and funding shelters and support groups for the same, and providing free counseling services to those who cannot afford those services on their own. Religious groups are often the first on the scene when a natural disaster strikes. They get boots on the ground and food in people's bellies.<p>Finally, religious groups subsidize education and create schools. It is likely that at some
point you benefited either directly or indirectly from this educational foundation, especially in the US. By doing this, organized religions help
lift millions out of ignorance.<p>Organized religion is not what the media portrays.That is such an important idea, that perhaps an entire essay should be written just on that sentence.<p>Not all (or most) religious people kill people in the name of God, or create secret compounds where they can marry teenage girls and call it ""God's work,"" or use religion to justify hatred/torture/war,etc. These things definitely exist, but the dosing you are fed by the media/popular culture is all wrong. It's like anything else - you only get fed the things that will bring page views, and those stories tend to be about
very strange wings of religions.<p>Most religious people very quietly live ordinary lives and use their religious faith to find deeper meaning through self-sacrifice and service to others. But that wouldn't make a good story, so you don't read much about it.<p>Google is popularizing an alarming trend to treat religious groups like the ""crazy uncle"" who won't go away when I think they should instead realize that much of their own success (via the foundations mentioned above) is a direct or indirect result of the principles that organized religion has brought them. Google is benefiting from all that has been handed to them while spitting at the giver and potentially shutting off those gifts for future generations.

The FSF is complaining about something that both Apple and VideoLAN had no part of, but that's who they can point fingers at.

The only party's substantially affected here are iOS users, who are now deprived of a program to play more video types.

But you shouldn't treat standards as though they were gods. There's no need to. We support standards in the ways that are useful to users, and we depart from them when that becomes more useful to users.<p>... It was already approved and we had already had a chance to object, so all I could do was make a comment. So I couldn't block approval of the standard because I was a voting member of the committee. I couldn't block approval of the standard on those grounds, so instead...I posted a notice about the coup in which the evil repressive forces of POSIX were being thrown off...To have an excuse to say that we still support the spec, if you define the environment variable, POSIX_ME_HARDER was the original way. Then a slightly prudish board member convinced me to change it to POSIXLY_CORRECT which I now think was a mistake. I should have left it as POSIX_ME_HARDER.""<p>It's interesting that IMO Stallman-the-politician (for me not a negative term, BTW) comes off as much more of a standards advocate than Stallman-the-engineer.",1288556625

So I think it's not in searching of people to hate you but in having the guts to speak your mind and do the things you believe in no matter what others think of it. And hatred of other people because of you doing it and them not having guts to do it sometimes comes along with it.",1288555961

Ideally, we'd all only care about our karma insofar as it helps us avoid making lousy posts, and ignore it entirely otherwise, but idealism doesn't scale.<p>""How will this influence my average?"" is definitely an oversimplified heuristic for deciding what is worth contributing, but it's reasonably accurate and I think it's the best one we've got.

Those comments <i>should</i> result in positive feedback (via average karma or otherwise), but they don't.<p>That is to say: The site has a reward mechanism (karma).

It's a nice idea to think that artificial barriers will result in us ramping up education, but that's a process that will take decades. You can't just start teaching advanced computer science to high school seniors who can barely read and struggle with basic math. So what's more likely is that the lack of skilled professionals in this country will gradually reduce our pace of innovation relative to other countries and cause a relative decline in our wealth, causing us to fall further and further behind.<p>It's far faster and more efficient to let the hoards of skilled professionals in other countries come here, especially since many of them are willing to risk almost anything to move their families here and would stay forever if we let them. Instead we severely restrict them and then we compound the problem by letting people come here to go to school and then make them leave if they can't find a job.

2937373,comment,2936432,2936906,6,0,shiven,,,"Udo, I think you are onto something here. An important aspect of <i>going</i> minimalist is getting rid of (so called) superficial possessions. That means, to a large extent, only those who have <i>stuff</i> to get rid of can do so as a part of <i>going</i> minimalist.<p>The second important aspect is taking care of basic needs of daily living: food, clothing, shelter, healthcare (when absolutely needed). For someone engaged in the daily struggle to have such basic needs <i>satisfied</i>, the very idea of getting rid of <i>anything</i> they possess would be an anathema.<p>Clutter and hoarding are, thus, in (some ways) the unintended results of that struggle. Every item that has been acquired by (very) hard labor, or (minimal) lucky breaks is, from that point on, almost a <i>lifeline</i>. The question: <i>What if I need this again?</i> rings out every time an item is about to be discarded.<p>However, the other side of the same argument is the definition of <i>needs</i> (as opposed to <i>wants</i>). There are always going to be genuine needs and the point of comfort one feels with their <i>net worth</i> in satisfying those needs is going to define the point at which fear of the unknown ceases to be a driving factor in their decision making process. Including the decision to <i>go</i> minimalist.<p>That point is, understandably, different for everyone of us. In the end, I feel, it is easier to make the <i>minimalist choice</i> with (a). a solid net-worth (bank balance, property etc.) OR (b). absolute courage when a sense of <i>security</i> is lacking such as when (a) is absent OR (c). a combination of (a) and (b).<p>------<p>TL;DR : I think, it is easier to be minimalist if you are materially <i>secure</i>; have sufficient support for a minimalist lifestyle from your life-partner or rugged <i>courage and self-confidence</i> if you are single/dependent-free.",1314629929

Seems like a nice structure, if it works, i.e. if it stands up to audit scrutiny.  It seems to me counterintuitive that a CDN consulting firm taking no financial risk when doing SR&ED for a US customer would be eligible.<p>Many of the CRA guidance docs cite IP ownership as an eligibility condition.  They also point to forms T1145 and T1146 as the mechanism to transfer SR&ED costs & credits between non-arms-length parties, but these apply when both parties are Canadian.  In your case you've got non-arms-length parties, one US and one CDN.  I can't find any specific CRA statement that applies.<p>But ultimately all those CRA docs are just guidance,and the ITA prevails. Can you point to the section of the ITA that blesses what you're doing here?",1314629829

If there's one thing I've learned about Google: avoid doing anything that might require some sort of intervention by them to fix your account--you won't be able to contact anyone and they just don't care unless you're famous. Someone like me will just languish in the cogs. The only times they care are when someone famous/influential gets inconvenienced or the other case is when a large group of users are affected and they have to dust off the backups.

2937302,story,,,1,0,Downtag,"The real problem, as I see it...",,"Just passing along an email I sent to the author of a recent LA Times article.  Curious on what others think on the topic.  Begin email...<p>Ms. Semuels,<p>I enjoyed and appreciate your article California plunges to bottom in new business creation (http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-state-new-businesses-20110824,0,6145591.story).<p>I propose a follow-up article on WHY California has seen such a dramatic drop in the establishment of new businesses (and the growth of existing businesses).  Although you did cover a couple of the reasons  government red tape, environmental regulations  those are primarily the hindrances of manufacturing and agriculture based businesses.  The two noted prohibitory factors arent really hindrances at all to a majority of the businesses that are established/would be established on a regular basis.  The biggest problem, felt personally as well as noted by every entrepreneur (new and experienced alike) that Ive spoken with, is funding.  More accurately, the unavailability of funding.<p>As someone who is currently battling the economy to get funding for a new business (www.TheDownTag.com), I know all too well how difficult it is to find and secure the capital to launch.  Ive been working for the last two years to get Downtag off the ground, with the list of people who want to be my customers growing with each passing day.  However, this means nothing within the traditional funding channels and those who control them.  Ten years ago, an entrepreneur could secure funding with a sketch of an idea on the back of a cocktail napkin.  Today, it requires an office full of corporate experienced leaders, a working demo (at minimum) of the product/service, and a  mile long list of customers already using it  not to mention the financials to show that youre either making a profit or are well on your way to breaking even.  Thats all fine and goodif you have the personal finances to establish all of the aforementioned.  How many people have a spare million under the mattress?<p>What is a normal entrepreneur to do to get all of this in place, which only puts them in the position to MAYBE get outside funding?  Go to a bank?  Not when all of the banks are holding onto their money with a death grip!  Go to the SBA?  Nope, their programs are about as useful as trying to hold a gallon of water with a sieve.  Angel investors?  Not an option anymore, now that pretty much all angel investors are sending their money overseas and/or are only investing in established organizations (see the previous list for what is required to qualify as an established organization).  Incubators?  Theyre just as demanding as the angel investors with requirements that must be met and dont provide the level of funding that businesses realistically require in seed or early stages.<p>You cite an unemployment rate of 12.4% which, in theory, should HELP small businesses by creating a pool of highly qualified yet low cost employees.  Well, that would be trueIF funding were available to actually establish the businesses in the first place.<p>As Im sure you know, small businesses are attributed with supplying a majority of the jobs in this country and always have held this accomplishment to my knowledge.  As you also are aware, the unemployment rates are ridiculously high.  Lest we forget that the real number is higher than the reported number since any number reported doesnt account for the number of unemployed that havent applied for financial help and/or those who have run out of unemployment benefits.<p>So whats the answer?  Sure, we can cut some of the red tape out of the equation and loosen up on the regulations.  Will that solve the REAL underlying problem?  It wont even make a visible dent, unless that visionary that works 20 hours a day chasing a dream with the only goal of saving a few lives can secure the funding to launch his business in the first place!  Once that happens, California will see an increase in the number of businesses established, there will be a noticeable decrease in the unemployment rate, banks and investors start making crazy amounts of money again, and the world gets to once again see what California does best  revolutionizing the way we all live through unequaled innovation!<p>Saving livesone tag at a time,<p>M.

For some reason I'd been putting it off but seeing it there for less than $1.50 per gig, at the capacity I wanted for my macbook, suddenly seemed to be a no-brainer. Hell, I remember paying $100 per gig back in the '90s. Somehow my mental model of ""reasonable prices to pay for storage"" has just been totally biased by years and years of dirt cheap HDDs.<p>Frankly it hasn't been the jaw-dropping entering-hyperdrive performance boost I had kind of hoped for (I'm a rails dev). While a definite improvement, it seems that for many of my most common tasks (read: tests) I have merely pushed the bottleneck back onto the CPU. But while it hasn't sped up all that much, it <i>never</i> slows down, which you don't notice at first but over time has a subtle confidence-building effect. Application launch speeds are much improved, for those who spend a good part of their day launching apps, which is not me. I tend to launch a few and then use them for the next two weeks before I restart. I also like how the drive does not make whining sounds when I move the computer before it's gone to sleep.<p>Recommended, anyway, they're cheap enough now that it's not a luxury, even if like me you use most of it for your work music collection.",1314628331

I am involved with a startup where one of the potential founders is in litigation to regain control of a different project he started. He is afraid of repeating the same mistakes and is slowing us down considerably.<p>His experience boils down to the following.  He was supposed to be the money guy and would be in the background completely.  In this role he paid nearly all initial expenses for the first year including bringing in a knowledgeable manager to train founder #2 who would run operations afterwards.  After a few years the company was very successful but founder #2 has refused to pay any dividends or salary to founder/investor #1. This is currently in litigation and founder #2 is using the company money to bankroll the defense.<p>Due to this experience founder #1 is trying to create an elaborate structure of control and is acting as an anchor on the new venture. I'm trying to find effective controls to remove the risk of 1 founder hijacking the company.  Can this be done by how one sets up the articles of incorporation or corporate bylaws?  Is there a better way?  In general there is trust between the founders but this aspect is causing contention.  How do you limit this risk?
Thanks in advance!<p>HN reader<p>EDIT: Corrected formatting issue.",1314627605

Email is standardized, so gmail as a client could be evaluated on its own merits. Since it was good, usage grew. There were no external factors outside gmail which could slow down gmails growth.<p>Social networks show network effects. You cant use a new social network with your real social network being somewhere else. If the initial growth is slow, the early adopters will be pretty alone there, for a long time. The new network has to have advantages over the old to justify the initial isolation period. FB had advantages over MySpace, so users slowly crept over. G+ had basically nothing over FB other than this ""not evil"" label they gave themselves. Then they started strictly enforcing a real name policy, which many users perceive as evil, and the ""no evil"" label is perceived as a blatant lie. This removes their (imho) main advantage over FB, and without a net gain, less and less people bother to try.",1314627235

Good read!<p>""You see, procrastinators tend to be people who have, for whatever reason, developed to perceive an unusually strong association between their performance and their value as a person. This makes failure or criticism disproportionately painful, which leads naturally to hesitancy when it comes to the prospect of doing anything that reflects their ability  which is pretty much everything.""<p>First paragraph in the text that stuck me so deeply.

5378646,comment,5378008,5378356,34,0,nkurz,,,"<i>When people think about plant patents, they're usually thinking of the Monsanto suits.</i><p>Most people might, but those posting patent questions to a gardening forum are a special breed.  The patent question comes up often for those interested in propagating fruit trees.  Groups that exchange varieties of plants and desire to obey the law often have complicated self-policing policies.  For example, here are guidelines for a local chapter of the California Rare Fruit Growers association:  <a href=""http://www.crfg-redwood.org/patented-fruits-list-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crfg-redwood.org/patented-fruits-list-2013.pdf</a><p><i>I'm just saying, the likelihood of accidentally become a lawsuit target appears like it might be overblown in some ways.</i><p>Perhaps, but for many the question of risk is distinct from the question of legality.  The questioner wasn't asking whether he was likely to be caught, but how to determine ahead of time if one is behaving legally.  It's not clear if this is even possible.  Does intent matter?  One of the major breeders of new fruit varieties in the US asserts that it does not:<p>""Asexual propagation of patented plants (including any of its parts such as leaves, buds, cuttings, seed, fruit or pollen) is strictly prohibited without the written authorization of the patent holder or the patent holders agent. Possession of improperly propagated trees of patented varieties (such as the receipt of trees, budwood or graftwood from unauthorized sources) constitutes infringement, even if an illegal propagation was inadvertent.""<p><a href=""http://www.dwnbeta.com/plant-patents-and-trademarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwnbeta.com/plant-patents-and-trademarks</a>",1363309079

Her flight came in late and she missed the connecting flight (late at night). There were no United employees on staff (at all!) in LGA at that hour. My mom spent several hours trying to get someone at United to help her out and they couldn't get ahold of their ""on call"" staff member to assist her. They ended up telling her to ""sleep on a bench"" and wait till the staff came in some 4-5 hours later in the morning and someone could get her set up with a new connecting flight. They eventually offered a $150 coupon for her ""next"" flight, which will never happen.",1363308738

In the case of weather or other delays and cancellations, United will contact you or the person designated to meet your child at his or her final destination. You can also track the status of the flight on united.com. Advise your child to remain with a United representative at all times. Consider giving your child a calling card or teaching him or her how to make collect calls so he or she can reach you.\n</code></pre>\nIn short, someone at United screwed up. The chaperone didn't call. That's bad, and they need to investigate whether this was a one-off or systematic screw-up.<p>That said, flying from Great Falls to Nashville (which is already hairy due to the small regional airports on either end of the journey) on a day where there's a major winter storm forecast to slam the midwest. This including a foot of snow on Chicago, which ruins United's system for the day (is this not a well known fact)? If you don't want to entertain the possibility that your child might be stranded without you? Fly yourself to Great Falls, meet your child, and fly back together. Alternatively, driving to Atlanta or Memphis will up your odds considerably of a successful venture.<p><pre><code>   Instead of sending her on the next flight to Nashville, they have routed her across the country on three connections and is staying overnight in Houston with a complete stranger!\n</code></pre>\nUnited probably thought there was a pretty good chance ""the next flight to Nashville"" wouldn't exist (It was delayed 5 hours, arriving in Nashville at 2am).<p>This doesn't excuse United's behavior, but Ms. Neff-Aguilar could have prepared better.",1363308709

However, under current regulations, it is legally risky for them to do it. Some of what they do incurs legal risk.

That other approach would essentially have the USG ""pick winners"" in the information assurance market and, down the road, would allow the USG to designate certain private companies as ""critical infrastructure"" that would require the commercial ministrations of those companies.

If they are making mistakes of this level so often that they can't afford to refund the tickets in situations like this the ""small error rate"" defense no longer applies.<p>4) They blocked the account of someone trying to resolve the issue. This looks extremely petty and makes it appear as an ""us"" vs. ""them"". In a PR war you never want to be up against a wronged child.

The first year was mostly coursework (some were good, most were meh) and a bit of probing to find interesting fields for research. Unlike undergrad, some courses you take in graduate school are incredibly specific and cover whatever material the professor has been researching lately. The second year is typically more focused on doing research - you find an advisor and start diving deep into some specific problem. Though, the exact schedule can change from place to place.<p>I'm really enjoying myself and continued to a direct PhD track. It's the best job I've ever had. The work is interesting and the freedom is amazing. Your milage may vary.<p>I'm not sure what is the ""value"" of a master's degree is. It certainly looks good on a CV and might help you get a higher rank at some megacorp. Google for example is known to be very fond of advanced degrees. If you want to make software for a living I don't think it matters an awful lot. Particularly in the smaller companies and startups. Taking advanced courses will teach you some new tricks and acquaint you with fields you've never even heard of. You'll probably relearn some things from undergrad and understand the better. But the main point in a master's degree is to get a taste of academic research and see if you like it or not. There are a lot of interesting fields in CS and doing research in most of them is entirely different than being a professional programmer.<p>My recommendations to you, if you think you might be interested in research:\n1. Try to get into a very good university (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Turing_Award_laureates_by_university_affiliation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Turing_Award_laureates_...</a>). No point in doing an advanced degree at a mediocre school. Some of those places only offer PhD programs, but you can leave in the middle and get a master's degree.<p>2. If you have a specific field that interests you, try finding a school with several professors working in that field. You'll have more options that way.<p>3. Don't do it if you're burned out! You can get a job instead. If you like learning and solving difficult problems, after 1-2 years you'll probably get that itch again.<p>4. In my experience 2-3 months of travel is enough to completely recuperate from any feelings of burnout and to start getting excited about ""regular"" life again. This shouldn't cost more than a few thousand dollars if you fly to somewhere far and cheap.",1363306670

It is a law that every legal entity in the United States must maintain a public, permanent record of any and all complaints against it. They may choose to publish individual responses, but this is not required.<p>This would solve the problem of aggregating complaints. The first line of defense of a large entity is information asymmetry: they isolate the customer, make them feel like their problem is unique, or that it's no big deal, no-one else cares, etc. In this case, United (correctly) realized that PublikDemand's twitter account was successfully serving as a de facto complaint database, and acted to remove it.<p>Knowledge of other customer's complaints is a powerful weapon for any customer with a problem. It tells them that they are not alone, that the company has a problem, and opens the possibility of combining forces to take action against the company: the cost-burden of legal action against the company can be shared between plaintiffs, a kind of psuedo class action suit.<p>As it stands, only the most sensational horror stories are seen, and they are not reported in a way that is easily searchable or usable for the next customer that is abused and whose abuse is buried by information asymmetry.",1363306306

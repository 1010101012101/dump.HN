The use of this is an argument that can be had (personally I think it was a great play on Apple's part, see my comment here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5308345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5308345</a>)<p>The rest of this is ancillary stuff.  They aren't decoding h.264 on an ARM core, that's impossible for any significant bit rate, they are doing it with a purpose built bit of hardware, just as the HDMI encoding is done in a purpose built bit of hardware.

5315886,comment,5314268,5315784,4,0,lsc,,,">It's certainly possible to obtain this knowledge on your own with serious self-study. But it's a hard route (albeit one getting easier thanks to Coursera et al.)<p>Now, what little math and theory I have learned, well, really, what anything I've learned... I've found that it's dramatically easier to learn from books than from a lecture.  First, people talking?  really, really slow.  I ain't no speed-reader, but I can manage 400 words a minute, give or take, without skimming;  of course, I can go much faster when I'm just skimming over the stuff I already know.<p>My usual strategy is to buy several books at the same level on the same subject;  Preferably by very different authors.  (I want at least one of the books to be a classic by the person who came up with the idea.)    the idea being that each one is going to explain it in a slightly different way, and while I'm only going to retain a small portion of each book, well, books read fast, they don't cost much, and if I take away 10% of each book?  I'm doing pretty okay.<p>(I mean, that said, my math and my theory is still pretty weak, compared to many of my educated peers who work at the same payscale, So I'm not saying my strategy is good or anything... it's just that I've never gotten much at all out of lectures.   Payscale is also interesting... it seems to scale more with negotiation aggression than anything else.)<p>>Is theory actually useful? I would claim that it is, even for programmers doing CRUD apps and the like. Knowing the fundamental abstractions of computer science and the ways people have applied them in the past saves an enormous amount of needless reinvention. As a concrete example, parsing is a very well-studied problem in academia. But somebody without that background trying to write a parser will struggle far more than another familiar with CFGs or PEGs.<p>Why the fuck would you write your own parser for a CRUD app?<p>Seriously, that's whats wrong with the world.<p>I'm a SysAdmin.  The way I see the industry?  you hire a bunch of php monkeys to slap something together. customers don't like it.  You pivot, come up with some other business idea, hire php monkeys to slap something together (usually using the same monkeys and the same code)   you repeat until the market likes the output.<p>By this time?  It's a giant hairball. It's disgusting.  But you are getting users, and it's making money, so you've gotta scale.<p>Now, you could pay a bunch of 'real programmers' to write you something good, but that can take months or years even with competent management.<p>So what do you do?  you hire someone like me.   I show up and put a caching http proxy here, I put some indexes on the database server (and put it on a beefy server, and maybe even setup a read-only replica for the database)  etc, etc.... i slap on duct tape until you get around to having a competent person re-write the whole mess.    That's the ""computer janitor"" role.<p>So yeah.  that's why I hate CRUD programmers trying to re-invent the fucking wheel.  There are plenty of parsers out there.  Use them.<p>This, this is why sysadmins hate NoSQL.   seriously, in a few days I can make a crashy access db 1000x faster and more stable fairly easily by ODBCing the data out to a reasonable database.   relational databases are incredibly easy to tune and improve, and I don't need to understand your giant PHP hairball that is full of global variables.   USE A RDBMS.  then you can do your job, and then if the thing takes off and you need to scale, I can come in and do mine.",1362358510

5315874,comment,5315815,5315815,6,0,david_shaw,,,"I think that now, perhaps more than ever, America and Americans would benefit from domestic high-speed rail.<p>As someone who travels occasionally--albeit somewhat infrequently--for both business and pleasure, I share the opinion that flying is not altogether pleasant. From arriving at the airport several hours early, to dealing with TSA, to sitting in the cramped aircraft seating, it's not a stretch to say that it's a somewhat miserable experience. For the amount of money one has to pay for a flight, especially if going to a less popular/metropolitan destination, the experience is very sub par.<p>Trains, however, are a joy to ride. There is no TSA (or any other form of security theatre), no having to show up several hours early, and the journey itself is pleasant while watching the world pass by outside. Delays are very infrequent. I've personally done some of my best thinking, coding, and writing while on a train.<p>There is, however, one major problem: trains in America are <i>slow</i>. Slow to the point that driving through Los Angeles (including traffic delays) is still about twice as fast as taking the Amtrak. There is probably some efficiency gain on longer trips, but who wants to sign up for a 72-hour train ride that could easily be a 36-hour drive or, more realistically, a two hour flight <i>for the same cost?</i><p>I would welcome a revitalization of the rail industry in this country with open arms, but only if they do it right; after all, as a project that would likely be subsidized with tax dollars, I'd rather not pay for something that one one would use.",1362358242

This is true for people who go to college and those that forgo it.<p>So if you don't go to college to learn to code, why go at all? \nYou go to learn the fundamentals of computer science and math which underlie everything that we do.<p>It's certainly possible to obtain this knowledge on your own with serious self-study. But it's a hard route (albeit one getting easier thanks to Coursera et al.) and given two candidates with equal coding ability, the one who went to college is far more likely to have a strong grip on theory.<p>Is theory actually useful? I would claim that it is, even for programmers doing CRUD apps and the like. Knowing the fundamental abstractions of computer science and the ways people have applied them in the past saves an enormous amount of needless reinvention. As a concrete example, parsing is a very well-studied problem in academia. But somebody without that background trying to write a parser will struggle far more than another familiar with CFGs or PEGs.<p>Being able to program is just scratching the surface of computer science. It's necessary but not sufficient for being a great programmer.",1362356172

However much of a ""shambles"" the Home Islands may have been in, the Japanese at least had telegraph cables, and when they stopped responding from Hiroshima, and when the outskirts of Hiroshima wired news of a horrific bomb detonation they actually sent planes over to investigate and confirm.<p>> The most likely reason that they surrendered was that they knew they were hooped once the Soviets finally joined the war against them on August 8th.<p>The U.S.S.R. declaration of war certainly caught them by surprise; but the Japanese were certainly not stupid.

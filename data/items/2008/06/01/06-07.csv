205714,story,,,2,0,codesurgeon,"EclipseDay at the Googleplex",http://codesurgeonblog.com/2008/05/eclipseday-hosted-by-google-attendee.html,"I have co-organized an Eclipse conference at Google, scheduled for June 24th at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA. The focus of the talks is more hands-on than what you might have experienced at EclipseCon. It should prove to be particularly insightful for those of you using Eclipse for development purposes and maybe to a minor extent also for those building products on the platform. I just wanted to ping the hacker news community about the limited attendee list filling up fast - let me know if you want to come and I can try to sneak a couple of hacks in.",1212303405

Each class was an exam which you took whenever you were ready to and the exams were offered every semester. So to get the degree you needed to take all of the relevant exams.<p>Not sure if anywhere else in Europe does things this way.",1212302627

Finance, and the landing page still offers the $11 plan) is Yahoo's existing service.  They are indeed making it free.<p>Here is what Google returned today that it had not before:\n<a href=""http://ycorpblog.com/2008/05/28/real-time-stock-quotes-on-the-house"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycorpblog.com/2008/05/28/real-time-stock-quotes-on-th...</a>",1212302352

205704,comment,205362,205362,0,0,jauco,,,"Try reading up on latent semantic analysis. It also uses vector calculus, but works a bit different IIRC. It can be used to identify words that are used in the same context and therefore should be the same. I'm not sure if it is directly applicable for recipes because of the concise language, but you might find interesting related articles.",1212301300

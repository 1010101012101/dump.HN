Thanks to remarkably steep price competition and remarkably poor discoverability, the app store very much lacks anything resembling a long tail.<p>We sold a small app for $1.99, just to compete with similar apps in the space. If we'd sold our app for $5.99, we would have made a tidy profit on solid initial sales and moved on to make another application. However, at the $5.99 range we're competing with much more polished and comprehensive applications.

They grew increasing large and numerous as the tribes of Easter Island began warring with one another, in an attempt to display the ""greatness"" of each tribes respective leaders. It is in part due to the obsession with symbolic greatness and the construction of the moai that led to the eventual downfall of the Easter Island culture, as can be seen by the eventual grass-roots moai destruction activity during the proper collapse of the island's society in the 1700s and 1800s.

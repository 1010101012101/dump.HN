7653409,comment,7651852,7652271,6,0,ghshephard,,,"Back in 1995 I wrote the mapping software for a &quot;Tundra Tracker&quot;, this was the navigation software for a supply vehicle that could navigate in the arctic in whiteout conditions.  The idea was to have someone drive a path while conditions were good, and we would then lock in all the waypoints.   Rather than store all the waypoints for the path, we were able to eliminate about 99% of them with various splining algorithms.<p>One of our big concerns back then, though, was that US Military would degrade the SA (Selective Availability) signal - it had happened in the Gulf War, and our tracks, which were normally accurate to within 3-4 meters, went wacky and were almost 50 meters off at times.<p>The solution was to mount a radio antenna, have it calculate it&#x27;s &quot;True&quot; location by averaging a couple days worth of GPS signals, and then, continually transmit the difference between a current GPS signal and it&#x27;s known location.  This Differential GPS let us calculate paths to within 1m of accuracy.<p>When I asked what prevented a military opponent from doing the same thing, I was told that the first thing in the battlefield that gets hit as a command center would be anything transmitting RF, particularly if it was believed to be for D-GPS.  Also, D-GPS isn&#x27;t that effective for missile tracking, as you need to get differential signals in areas outside of your zone of control.",1398560346

I do iOS stuff occasionally, and in that world one of the main purposes of interfaces (in Objective-C, protocols) is to explicitly declare that some entity adheres to a contract - it promises to implement some pre-agreed-upon functionality that other entities can use. What do implicit interfaces buy you? Better static type checking? Less typing?<p>/* Also, from the blog:<p>> Nowhere in this code did we ever declare a relationship between MyType and Answer.<p>&quot;Answer&quot; isn&#x27;t in the example.

Indeed, the extraordinary threat to democracy posed by their near-total lack of restraint is why their orgy of abuse has attracted such shock and dismay.

This is broadcast at regular intervals along with the location signals. This data tells you the orbital parameters of each satellite, without it you couldn&#x27;t get a precise location fix because you wouldn&#x27;t know where the satellites you were getting signals from were.<p>The GPS satellites are incapable of calculating their own ephemeris data, it needs to be uploaded from the ground. The system cannot simply reuse the same data forever because the orbits of the satellites change over time, and because the system is sensitive to very small changes a lot of higher order effects (such as radiation pressure, the non-sphericity of the Earth&#x27;s geoid, and so on) come into play which are not easily calculable. Over short periods the future ephemeris are predictable within reasonable bounds of precision, so the USAF uploads 30 days worth of ephemeris data to the GPS satellites on a regular basis.<p>If it were no longer possible to upload that data the system would eventually become either non-functional (depending on how the satellites and individual handsets are designed) or increasingly inaccurate until no longer useful.",1398557865

The premise was to toss a dart at a map, travel to wherever it landed and talk to strangers in the city or town to capture their stories.<p>We received a lot of negative feedback from people who weren&#x27;t interested in journalism. Mostly, they seemed to predisposed to think that the strangers in rural Georgia and northern Florida would shoe us away from their properties.

We would arrive at a small-town diner, look around, sigh and think, &quot;Okay, who&#x27;s going to break the ice...&quot; But once we got talking, the strangers were always welcoming. The owners of a tobacco farm and a turpentine factory even showed us around their properties. [1]<p>For me, the experiences of MapDart validate the research in this story.

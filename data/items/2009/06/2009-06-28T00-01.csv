677380,comment,677125,677285,0,0,pmjordan,,,"If you look at the HTML 4 recommendation from the W3C, you'll find that <i>this is not invalid HTML</i>. SGML and HTML, unlike XML and XHTML, allow implicit opening and closing tags. As far as I know, they even allow overlapped nesting, which even breaks the tree nature of the document structure, e.g. <b>foo<i>bar</b>baz</i>. Browsers have supported this stuff since HTML 1, I seriously doubt there is any significant penalty in parsing.<p>e.g. <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.3</a>",1246150155

The element is already closed before the parser gets to the closing tag - so, in essence, you would be trying to close it twice.",1246149544

You think a web developer who already has experience in all the tools used to create a web app is going to spend the equivalent amount of time learning a completely new languange, platform, developer tools et al AND THEN using them to program an app. I'm sorry but that's really a ridiculous thing to say.</i><p>As a software developer, Objective-C is just another imperative C-derived language (a pure superset of C, actually), with Smalltalk-decedent OO features. It's not (or shouldn't be) an alien experience.<p>My comment assumed a baseline software developer proficiency. If simple high-level webapp development is all you've ever done, then of course -- writing an Objective-C application will be more difficult. Perhaps that's a good reason to write one.<p><i>As for the rest of your argument,AT&T's Edge connection downloads at around 25KB. So a 1K page (which you claim causes an ""unpleasant wait"") would download in 1/25th of a second even on a slow connection.</i><p>In addition to failing to account for additional resources (the page won't be 1K in total), you forgot to account for latency (there's quite a bit).<p><i>As for the rest, my point still stands.

677367,comment,676203,676881,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, if your target audience is investors, TC is probably the best possible place to be.  If you actually want to sell real products, TC is probably not useful.  We've been on TC once (alongside some other YC companies), and VentureBeat once (dedicated article), both very nice articles, and we were happy to have the coverage...but our best sales day ever during our first two years was when someone linked to our site in a <i>comment</i> on Slashdot (we've since reached a point where we regularly top that, but we still consider it a really good day when it happens).<p>I tend to be suspicious of companies <i>and</i> investors that only look to the various mouthpieces of the valley for their news.  There's a whole world of business happening every day that TC and the other valley rags have no awareness of.  That's OK, of course, as TC has its niche and serves it well.

Those who are going to see it, probably already have.  Those who aren't, probably weren't paying attention and never will anyway.  There are already services that tell you what you said that made people unfollow you -- so you can delete tweet manually or modify your tweeting behavior (services like: <a href=""http://www.tweeteffect.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tweeteffect.com/</a> and <a href=""http://twitterless.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitterless.com/</a> )<p>Twitter couldn't remove it from timelines until people refresh, and I'm not sure if third-party clients cache tweets, but if they do, then you'd never get your problem tweet deleted from those timelines either.<p>I guess this feature could somehow block people from retweeting your tweet? Maybe... I suppose.  But, uh, most people don't retweet things that made them want to unfollow you.  So that would be a silly feature.<p>What Twitter SHOULD do, instead, is fix their delete function, which leaves deleted tweets in Twitter search.  Or provide a quick edit function (i.e., editing available for 90 seconds after tweeting) so people could fix typos.",1246149212
677365,comment,677095,677292,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"""Publication does not affect your rights under patent law.""<p>True, but letting Mono flourish for as long as it has <i>without taking legal action against it</i> opens up a can of worms that can screw with future action against it. Patent law recognizes the idea that implicitly letting someone infringe and not doing anything about it until it's most profitable for you/most damaging to them isn't the way the game's supposed to be played.<p>Add to that the fact that patent suits are the global thermonuclear war of the technology industry (the only way to win is not to play), and I'll be surprised if anything serious ever happens.",1246149018

You think a web developer who already has experience in all the tools used to create a web app is going to spend the equivalent amount of time learning a completely new languange, platform, developer tools et al AND THEN using them to program an app.  I'm sorry but that's really a ridiculous thing to say.<p>(and I don't mean to be rude but really, who voted this comment up?

Everything you spoke of requires a cracked iPhone which the great majority of people don't have anyway.<p>For the record, you're wrong below but I can't reply to you and I don't know why.  But the short of it is anyone who is ACTUALLY a developer knows there's a lot more than picking up a language to development (though again there will be time to pick up the language and that will be time a web app developer wouldn't need to spend).  You have all your tools including your editor, unit testing tool, etc...  So again you're wrong.  And yes there might be overhead to a web app but at 1k it's still going to come down in about a second or two.

This fact alone may affect the decision where to incorporate. A jurisdiction where jury verdicts tend to be very conservative may be preferable to one with a reputation for runaway jury awards. The cost of defending a lawsuit may also be a significant factor in this decision. Defending a lawsuit in the owner's home state will be substantially cheaper than defending the same lawsuit across the continent [or as one person here says, across the world]. This may be a factor in deciding where to incorporate</i><p>And you can always be sued in the state in which you are operating. So it seems that you can be sued in both states.",1246147886

Not using the AI (word suggestion/prediction) at all. Yet it drives me regularly insane, especially when typing technical terms, abbreviations and http addresses, because it just refuses to accept that there sometimes just has to be NO space after a dot. Also writing uppercase seems to be a hard task for SwiftKey. I&#x27;d like them to enhance the AI this way: if SwiftKey recognizes permanent violations of their built in rules, just ask the user if he wants SwiftKey to ignore certain rules.

All three of them are smart, delightful people in my experience.<p>This strikes me as a bit of a storm in a tea-cup, but there is some background context worth noting.  R&#x27;s academic roots have created some interesting cultural aspects within the community.  For example, in academia you spend a fair amount of time critiquing other people&#x27;s work and trying to find flaws.  It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to trash someone&#x27;s argument, even to their face when they give a presentation.  Once you accept that it&#x27;s not personal but necessary for research to progress, it&#x27;s OK, but to begin with its a horrible experience.  Outside of academia, this is mostly just awful impolite behaviour.<p>That attitude of being allowed to correct people&#x27;s arguments without bothering with any formalities has been a feature of the many aspects of the R community since its inception.  In particular, the R-help mailing list and the R bug tracker can be scary places for new users.  As the R community has grown beyond the confines of academia, this has led to tensions within the community.  These sorts of cultural issues have long worried a lot of R users, and I can only guess that Oliver&#x27;s position on the R Foundation Task Force on Women led him to worry about diversity issues more than most.<p>The other relevant aspect of the R community is that R is developed and managed by the R Core Team (<a href=""https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html</a>), which consists of 20 guys, about half of whom are actively working on R, and all of whom have day jobs beside being in R Core.  They do a great job, but the R community is now several million people, which means that managing the mailing lists and the bug tracker - dreadfully tedious tasks at the best of times - must now be rather overwhelming.  I&#x27;ve personally been (mildly) scolded a few times when submitting bugs that I thought were reasonable but members of R Core thought differently.  While I think that Duncan&#x27;s response was a big overreaction, in the context of him trying to optimize not having to spend time dealing with the bug tracker, I can understand why he chose to ban Oliver.<p>My opinion is that a lot of strife could be avoided if R Core delegated a lot more of the admin work - I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of grad students who could be persuaded into acting as first line support on the bug tracker, or moderators on a mailing list.",1454485022

Why? Because they use the grid as backup and the grid requires significant maintenance. There&#x27;s a cost to that.<p>As it stands everyone pays for a part of these costs through their power bill. Take enough people away from paying into the grid and all of a sudden rates go up for everyone or the utility takes a loss. You might be fine with the latter but a lot of utilities are rate based. Meaning the government determines how profitable they will be and rate increases need to be justified.<p>Will be very interesting to see how different states tackle this issue in the years to come. The utilities don&#x27;t like it because incentives for roof based solar mean their rate base erosion gets accelerated.<p>It must be added that this article talks about distributed generation (rooftop). Interesting that the incentives for rooftop development are more than solar plant development even though utility scale solar is far cheaper than rooftop and is sold at wholesale prices via PPAs with utilities.

Just getting the database together in a machine readable form would be a huge accomplishment<p>There is a huge (missing) sample problem in genetics.  This creates problems in epigenetic research, even with gene variations where there are accurate sample sizes, because it becomes extremely difficult to figure out if it is the gene that it is the trigger or an epigentic factor turning on a gene, and if so, what sort of epigenetic factors are we looking at in the first place. Turning off genes through behavior changes is mostly off the plate without getting accurate data first.<p>Part of the reason: It is still expensive to decode every genome in a human (around of $250k per person right now)  That cost will drop radically in the next 10 years because it is only 1-5 parts that really need to drop in cost to make it around $250/person.  Then matching that data to health and other related records en mass is huge- especially because most basic health records in EHR are geared towards billing procedures and short term case discussion, not tracking people, families, and communities<i>.<p>Furthermore, it is a true ethics issue.  To donate part of your full genome to science means parts of your genome will be bought and sold for research purposes.  The going rate for simple stuff is about 1k/genome, with more money to the market with more interesting medical histories and family data attached.  Creating a really big database that is open means this data stops being in a market and could push for innovation in the field.<p></i>I&#x27;d like to remind you that we have no idea why the county that Ycombinator sits in is among the top counties in the country for Breast Cancer rates.  Just getting an accurate sample size of Marin, San Mateo, and San Fransicio counties&#x27;s genetics and true medical history could make a huge impact on why people get cancer period, because we have no idea why there is a cluster there.",1454484427

Specifically, to place arbitrary legal restrictions on software so devs who use it are forced to buy into the ideology of GNU.<p>The ironic thing about FLOSS is that it acts counter to the ideals of libre. There&#x27;s no freedom in restricting how open source code is developed. In short, it enforces exclusivity.<p>It&#x27;s intended for developers who want to maintain ownership of any/all development of the code they produce. To remain the de-facto benevolent dictators for life whether or not that is good for the health of a project.<p>RMS didn&#x27;t create GPL out of some greater sense of altruism. Watch his talks about the early days before GPL. He created it in spite of the developers he worked with who moved on to industry. Stallman never moved on to industry and has spent a lifetime hiding away in academia and/or making a living off of awards and public speaking appearances where he preaches his ideology as canon.<p>You know who doesn&#x27;t make a living from FLOSS? the thousands of contributors who helped make his projects the success they are today. Funny how RMS never acknowledges their effort.<p>Hurd will never deliver on it&#x27;s promises and instead GPL piggy-backed on the success of linux to the point where (from a legal standpoint) both are essentially inseparable.<p>-----<p>As for &#x27;open source&#x27;...<p>True freedom is allowing others to extend/improve the code for their own uses. I <i>prefer</i> &#x27;open source&#x27; <i>because</i> it fosters the degree of freedom that the GPL only superficially claims to promote.<p>If others find value in my contributions and leadership then they&#x27;ll support my projects and the direction I take. If somebody comes along that does a better job, so be it. That just means I probably have more room for improvement.<p>Removing one&#x27;s ego from the process creates something much more valuable.

11025159,comment,11024656,11024656,0,0,mikekchar,,,"The &quot;Heisenberg Developer&quot; name is really excellent.  I recall DeMarco saying in his excellent books (so many years ago): Do not measure anything unless you have a very specific action you want to take based on the data.  Why?  Because every measurement alters the way programmers work.  The author reports that increasing the granularity of the work (and thereby decreasing the time between measurable status updates) led to a lack of refactoring.  I have also experienced this one and it led to much head scratching on my part.<p>Which is not to say that one should not measure.  I&#x27;ve never actually used Jira, but apart from that, many of the things the author talks about are generally good ideas: reduce story size to a day or so, prioritise every 2 weeks, measure delivery at about the same interval.  Don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bath water.<p>I can say with some confidence that where they went wrong was that they tried to estimate the stories and then they made the cardinal sin of trying to measure the elapsed time for each story.  In the first case, you don&#x27;t need estimates.  Each story is a day or so.  It&#x27;s enough granularity.  In the case of measuring, there is no organisational benefit.  You can see the average throughput of stories.  You can estimate your final delivery (especially if you use a defect growth model to estimate how many requirements you are currently missing before delivery).  Measuring the actual time of an individual story adds absolutely nothing to your control of the project.<p>The main argument that I&#x27;ve heard for measuring are two fold.  First they feel that measurement will allow people to get better at estimating.  Again, it is not needed.  If you have a granularity of a day or two in your story sizes (and your throughput is showing that you are achieving that), then you have nothing to improve.  If your throughput is not there, then you need to see what the problem is.  It will be one of 3 things: your stories are too big, your code is too complicated, your programmers are crap.  The first is solved by making your stories smaller, the second is solved by working on technical debt, the third is solved by firing your programmers.  I recommend doing everything you can to solve the first, move on to the second, and only then resorting to the third.<p>What measuring <i>will</i> give you is an idea of the variance in the story sizes.  This is unimportant.  In fact it is critical <i>not</i> to measure this.  All you care about is throughput.  Variance is where the developers are putting the extra effort in to improve your throughput (by dealing with technical debt, improving tests in critical areas, creating efficient build systems, writing documentation, etc.).  If you remove the variance (as described by the author), you destroy the ability for the developers to optimize throughput.<p>The second argument for measuring time is to identify stories that are (or were) in trouble.  Again, this is unnecessary.  First, if you have a story and you are having a hard enough time that it is taking you longer than a day or two, then you <i>already know about it</i>.  Asking for help is what stand up is for (and really, I hate to have to say this, but that&#x27;s <i>all</i> standup is for).<p>If you are not having trouble, but you are spending a few extra days to refactor something, then you <i>already know about it</i>.  Everyone else does too because they can see the code that you refactored.<p>If you are sitting on your ass and wasting your days writing extremely long posts on HN, then you <i>already know about it</i>.  And so does everyone else (because you haven&#x27;t written any code today, and it&#x27;s not like you asked for help...).<p>I&#x27;m just going to write this one time.  If your reasons for measuring the amount of time for stories is because you secretly think that your developers are crap and that they don&#x27;t know what they are doing, no amount of measurement is going to solve the problem.  Make a decision.  Fire them, or not.  You can&#x27;t make a crap programmer good by pointing out how much time they spent on a story.  They <i>already know it</i>.",1454483221

Better get comfortable, because it&#x27;s going to take you several hours to persuade them that you do in fact know how to do your job and the wild-ass alternative they&#x27;ve just come up with is wanted by the market about as much as syphilis.<p>With these guys (and they&#x27;re always guys) you&#x27;ve got to process up and micromanage, because the only way to get a little bit of intelligent estimating out of them is to ask for ten times as much, so they can give you what you need while still feeling like they&#x27;re largely ignoring you. The only silver lining is the process eventually makes them leave, so they can be replaced by people who work well with others.<p>You know, I really don&#x27;t miss being a product manager.<p>Ranting aside, good developers in larger organizations realize that people have specializations, they and other parts of the company are interdependent, and a little administrative overhead is necessary to keep everybody moving forward together - so they work with people from other parts of the company in good faith, and this makes it possible to keep the administrative crap (which no one likes, it&#x27;s not just them) as light as possible for as long as possible.",1454483012

Tickets (or any type of change control system including git) really serve two purposes. 1) To track what changed 2) To track WHY something changed. A dev should be able to look up your ticket a year from now and be able to untangle the logic in your code changes tied to that ticket. If your ticket only has a title, or the briefest of descriptions you&#x27;ll find it hard to debug any issues introduced by this (and you&#x27;ll also be going to dev hell)",1454482928

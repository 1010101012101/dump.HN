The stars are still there, but the atmospheric diffusion of blue light from the sun prevents you from discerning the fainter light of a more distant star.<p>Lower yourself to the bottom of a deep well during the day, and look up again.  You can see the stars again, because the diffuse blue sunlight is much weaker there.<p>If you were to compress an image of the daytime sky in the same manner that an MP3 compresses audio, you could simply remove all that variation from faint stars and only keep the information from bright sunlight.  Follow the ghost discovery technique by taking the difference between the original and the compressed image, and you will see an image resembling the night sky.  But most people would not be able to discern much of a difference with the naked eye.<p>For audio, if you have a pianissimo piccolo solo, and someone plays a crash cymbal in the middle, you could remove some of the harmonics from the melody because humans are incapable of hearing them, and you can also remove that portion drowned out by the crash, because humans can&#x27;t hear quiet sounds through louder noises.<p>Finding the &quot;ghost&quot; track is actually revealing all the sound in a piece of music that no one ever hears anyway, whether the track is compressed or not, simply due to the hardware limitations of the human auditory system.",1403985092

Delisting has tax benefits.

Some people have been more moderate, for example giving two-way comments like &quot;this might work well on a touch screen but it&#x27;s awkward on my laptop&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s very simple&quot;.<p>Most telling to me is that absolutely no-one has actually come down in favour of either iOS 7 or Windows 8 overall so far, while I know at least one person who is trying to return a brand new iPad after a week because they &quot;hated it&quot; and several who have at some point in the recent past bought a device and either chosen Windows 7 over Windows 8 or actively downgraded after purchasing. People are literally avoiding or even returning or rapidly reselling new devices just to avoid these kinds of UIs.<p>I&#x27;m sad, though unsurprised, to see Google following Microsoft and Apple down this evolutionary dead end. As others have commented in this discussion, it seems like reducing everything to the least common denominator.

But I&#x27;d like to call out a distinction between the concentration of wealth, and the static nature of the oligarchy. One will continue to happen, the other Pikkety could be dead wrong about.<p>Andreessen says (paraphrasing) in the interview, &#x27;Pikkety says wealth and oligarchies will happen, but look at the Forbes 400 and you see lots of churn, where is this supposed stability that will happen with rich people cementing their gains&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s true that Pikkety presents a view of social mobility becoming increasingly static, and reverting to a supposed historical norm.<p>But one lovely book I have pg to thank for reading, &quot;The World We Have Lost&quot;, talks about how things were in England according to an analysis of actual data (county records etc). One chapter, &#x27;The One-Class Society&#x27; (&#x27;gentlemen&#x27; were the class, the only class that mattered), speaks of how there actually <i>was</i> a large amount of &#x27;churn&#x27; in the gentleman class -- even outside of cities and the merchant classes, it was possible for a father to become a substantial yoeman, and his heir to become a gentleman. Families went up, families went down.<p>But despite a certain amount of mobility being possible, all effective wealth and power that mattered was still very concentrated, as it has been for much of recorded human history, for many reasons.<p>This was momentarily interrupted by the usefulness of humans as wet robots that were briefly able to exert the political and economic leverage necessary to drive hard collective bargains about their compensation.<p>That was temporary. (Offshore wet robots, and eventually dry robots, taking the place of the less-needed troublemakers).<p>Wealth, even if mobile, will inevitably become more concentrated due simply to better technology and efficiency -- how can this not be so? It seems self-evident.<p>So, I guess the question is:<p>If technology magnifies individual differences in productivity, and if we accept as a given that attempting to tax away the resulting fruits of that productivity is on the whole economically injurious to an economy, how can wealth not become more concentrated over time?<p>(Yes, of course, there will be churn and disruption, and wealth will change hands. Even as it did among the gentleman class in England in the 1500s; families came up and families went down. But because of technological magnification of productivity it should tend to go to fewer people. This just seems like a natural law.)",1403983924

Current technology for decelerating from the high speed of atmospheric entry to the final stages of landing on Mars dates back to NASA&#x27;s Viking Program, which put two landers on Mars in 1976.

NASA&#x27;s Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) Technology Demonstration Mission, led by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., will conduct full-scale, stratospheric tests of these breakthrough technologies high above Earth to prove their value for future missions to Mars.",1403982701

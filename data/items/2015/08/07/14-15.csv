We shouldn&#x27;t forget that we&#x27;re all human, and there are myths and facts related to working fast.<p>Working &quot;fast&quot; is tricky. The ironic conclusion part of the article is an example to that. People will miss the point and screw up more while trying to be &quot;faster&quot;. However if a task becomes more automatic, it will become faster, which means that actually doing something &quot;fast&quot; would consume less energy, since it is more or less automated and unconscious, while &quot;trying&quot; to be fast would consume more energy.<p>The key here seems to be that just do something &quot;a lot&quot;, and it will become faster by itself through time by being more and more &quot;automated&quot;.  But <i>take your time</i>, and stop worrying about speed. Speed is just pressure which will bring more pressure as you do stuff faster.  Don&#x27;t create unrealistic pressure.<p>Another key is garbage collection. Just get stuff &quot;done&quot;, and get rid of the old tasks, or treat your long to-do items as &quot;later&quot; lists. If something really matters, you will do it anyway. You won&#x27;t even need a to-do list to keep track of your &quot;important tasks&quot;.",1438959077

GitLab&#x27;s open-source policy is one of the major reasons we chose it (along with self-hosting and fairly modern, built-in continuous integration), but the GitLab community could use some additional design and documentation effort.<p>Things that almost make me want to switch back to GitHub:<p>- GitLab is really hard to look at. All of our devs are having trouble visually locating comments in diffs. We&#x27;re always scrolling through the left-side menu looking for the issues tab. It&#x27;s hard to visually differentiate between items like comments in merge requests. Our eyes just can&#x27;t find and follow things. Even BitBucket looks better.<p>- GitLab-CI has poor documentation on runners, and a rather buggy test runner registration process that doesn&#x27;t provide any debugging output and produces false positives quite often.<p>- GitLab-CI has no unconditional cleanup directive, like CircleCI does... but if you&#x27;re re-using a test runner instead of tearing down the server each time, unconditional cleanup is the one thing you need. And no, the Docker executor doesn&#x27;t solve this because we don&#x27;t want to test our Docker containers inside Docker.<p>- CI is based on commit IDs. You can&#x27;t run particular CI events on merge requests. For example, this means no way to run integration tests on merge requests.<p>- Typography could be improved. When you&#x27;re looking at the issues page all day, this is quite noticeable.<p>- Slack integration is not great; it dumps links to &quot;GitLab Enterprise Edition&quot; instead of useful commit/changeset stuff like GitHub does.<p>If the community/GitLab can focus on putting on some of the design polish and service integration polish that GitHub has, GitLab would be a total winner for us, long-term.",1438958726

Consequently, user A can do anything with user B&#x27;s containers because docker doesn&#x27;t even have such thing as container ownership. Also docker protocol involves something which is basically opening shell as root, thus users with docker access have also a passwordless sudo. All those choices are basically ok for docker because it is designed for single-user systems like developer laptops or application servers.<p>Currently, for multi-user systems the only safe option for containers is sadly virtualisation or emulation; nice implementation of rootless chroot is proot, <a href=""http://proot.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://proot.me/</a>",1438958533

10022670,comment,10017651,10021994,0,0,schneems,,,"> Puma is great if you have a Ruby implementation without a GIL<p>Puma is also great if you have blocking IO like database queries or file uploads which most ruby/rails apps do. The GIL is released when Ruby does IO so it can context switch and run other threads.<p>> there is actually no deployment configuration of Puma which makes sense under MRI<p>I disagree, puma makes lots of sense on MRI but it is app specific. By this same argument Sidekiq would be worthless on MRI but it&#x27;s the dominant work queueing library even though it is solely threaded. In my experience Puma with MRI using &quot;hybrid&quot; with clusters and threads is faster than Unicorn (or rather you can get more throughput and less queueing). However it&#x27;s app specific. If your app is mostly doing number crunching in Ruby code and not touching IO, then the GIL never gets released and you don&#x27;t gain much by using threads. Again most Ruby apps use a lot of IO.<p>>  anything that&#x27;s computationally heavy will cause the other requests in that process to run slowly.<p>Exactly.<p>One of the main reasons I pulled recommendation for Unicorn was it&#x27;s lack of slow client handling, it doesn&#x27;t help to have a fast webserver, if all your workers are...waiting...on...bytes...and...can&#x27;t...do...anything...else. Nginx handles slow clients for you so nginx + unicorn is good, it&#x27;s a harder deployment configuration and it&#x27;s easier to tell our customers to configure one thing instead of 2, especially if that 1 thing yields better results for the majority of use cases.<p>I&#x27;m glad you got things working with nginx + unicorn. I&#x27;m a big fan of loading up PX dynos with lots of workers :) I hope some of the above helps clear up a few points for future readers. I always encourage people to try different options and take our recommendations with a grain of salt. It&#x27;s also why we&#x27;ve kept our Unicorn article so that anyone not happy with puma performance can try another webserver. Thanks for sharing!",1438957950

Free trade in particular gets even riskier as it means the populace has fewer levers of influence against the corporations.  Canada is experiencing this with auto manufacturers - many Japanese and American (some German) companies build cars in Canada and Mexico for the broader North American market because of North American free trade and lower labour costs in both countries (the exchange rate, single payer health care in Canada, more reasonable unions, etc).  But now so many jobs depend on these companies, the Regional Governments can&#x27;t let them leave in economic downturns.  So they subsidize.  Is this all a net positive?  Probably, but it&#x27;s hard to know.<p>When you accept the upside of trade you need to accept the downsides - but most don&#x27;t.  &quot;Let the free market choose&quot; isn&#x27;t an answer because we live in a Democracy, one feature of which is to prevent the market from getting what it wants when the people don&#x27;t like it.<p>The USA dominates technology with only a few counter-examples in Europe (SAP, Amadeus, ASOS) - but LOTS in China.

This should pretty much clear up who is worse.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. I have a six year old Macbook. In those six years I&#x27;ve updated to a new OS about three or four times. One time it has cost me 20 euros, the others were free. Not only that, but updating is a breeze, it&#x27;s painless and never was a problem. I never had to do a complete reinstall. My mother could have done this. It&#x27;s clicking a few buttons and that&#x27;s it.<p>On top of that, there is no serious degradation in speed. They claim it&#x27;s even faster, but that probably isn&#x27;t true for the older hardware. So even if they don&#x27;t support their three year old OS, you can update your six year old system to the most current one without problem. They could have served these updates as minor ones, but that wouldn&#x27;t be fun, nothing to show, no new names, no big shows.<p>Now tell me - what is it that they don&#x27;t support?",1438957691

Syntax HL in diffs!<p>- Github profiles are great. For a lot of devs, github is a CV, keep that in mind.<p>- gh-pages/jekyll integration kicks ass.<p>- Referencing and auto-closing issues<p>- webhooks, IRC bots<p>--<p>Here are some killer features not present on Github that would make me very seriously consider switching some large projects:<p>- Mailing list support. Think Discourse/Groupserver/Google Groups -> A UI that doesn&#x27;t suck, easy to enable for any project or organization, one click to subscribe/unsubscribe with your account<p>- Issue tracker&#x27;s lack of features is both good and bad. Good for the speed at which issues are filed, but sometimes you really do need some extra features. (Marking as dupe; Making as &quot;fixed&quot; when an autocommit missed it; etc). Shouldn&#x27;t go the bugzilla route and create meta-work, though.<p>- Proper support for mirroring repositories (two-way mirrors?)<p>- Improved IRC integration; eg. bots that watch over bug links / &quot;Take a look at #1234&quot; and spit out URLs and bug titles.<p>- Sign in with persona. :)<p>--<p>Where github simply falls short, and misc annoyances I have with it:<p>- Organizations/permissions. They said they&#x27;re working on that.<p>- Gists could be improved and integrated with issues (cf. attachments). BTW I absolutely love gist, does GL have something like that?<p>- SSL support for gh-pages on custom domains is lacking.<p>- &quot;Clean commit log&quot; workflows aren&#x27;t well supported. Rebasing messes with the commit ordering in PRs.<p>- Issue references in commit messages are great but when force-pushed several times, they spam the issues. No way to delete those messages.<p>- Comments on PRs disappearing. I haven&#x27;t thought about proper ways to improve the PR review workflow on GH, but I know it can be improved.<p>- The contributions graph algorithm doesn&#x27;t deal well with &quot;mass push&quot; outliers (see what I mean: <a href=""https://github.com/jleclanche/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jleclanche/</a>)<p>- The &quot;PRs are issues&quot; legacy still shows itself, they moved away from it though.<p>- I constantly have to clean projects I forked for a single issue.<p>- Wikis are cool but kinda lackluster. No way to inter-link pages.<p>- It&#x27;s closed source!<p>--<p>UX thoughts on gitlab.com, the site (about.gitlab.com):<p>- No way to see an actual repository, what Gitlab looks like.

There&#x27;s plenty room if you squish/remove the corp/press logos and twitter spam.<p>- Video at the bottom is completely out of place. Looking at it, it has 55k views, that&#x27;s really nothing. This contradicts my previous note but I didn&#x27;t even notice it at first since it was so low.<p>- The page is fairly slow to load (~2 seconds). It&#x27;s also huge. I really think there&#x27;s just too much on it. Do you really need testimonies there?<p>- Top of the page is overall excellent.<p><a href=""https://about.gitlab.com/better-than-github/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://about.gitlab.com/better-than-github/</a><p>- Love the link to that page being present, since it&#x27;s the first question I&#x27;m asking myself. Dropping points on lack of graphics (examples/screenshots)<p>-> What caught my eye on that page: Attachments in issues. WIP protection is neat but gimmicky. Builtin CI kicks ass!

For example, being able to move from the homepage level to specific project back and forth is a bit confusing. Would love a re-design of UI.<p>EDIT:<p>Lot of feedback that I can give. So far:<p>- Make it easy to navigate between index page and specific groups/projects.  May be on login to index, just show a dashboard with all groups/projects that I am part of. If Admin, then show me additional options like what you have in &quot;Admin Area&quot; menu. Here is one idea. Just show all menu options in the left sidebar and split it like:<p><pre><code>    - Home\n\n    - Groups\n\n        - Projects\n\n          - Project 1\n\n            - all menus that shows up for projects\n\n    - Admin Area\n\n      - Profile Settings\n\n      - Users\n\n      - Mail Settings\n</code></pre>\n- User profile management is not that good for admins. For example, just yesterday one of my developers got locked out and I could not reset his access via the UI. I had to go in the config files to update the lockout timestamp.<p>- Also for new users, as admin I want the control to add them as verified user already. Currently I don&#x27;t think that options is there in UI unless we fiddle with the code.<p>- For email driver, a simple form in UI will be nice to have. For example, if I want to use Mandrill, give me that option in the UI.<p>Bottomline is that even though we are developers, we don&#x27;t want to change the .rb files for Gitlab and instead focus on an easy UI.",1438956470

10022543,comment,10021376,10022315,0,0,ronjouch,,,"> The safety of the implementation language is far from the only concern when considering the security impact of modern browser features. [...] Those kinds of things are not solvable with a safer language (in some cases that probably makes fixing timing attacks more difficult/impossible). I&#x27;m sure there are more of these kinds of things to be found. Some of them are realistically never going to be fixed now because they are baked into the standards and the browser vendors clearly care more about animating gizmos and not breaking existing sites than leaking users browser state.<p>Good points, didn&#x27;t know about the SVG exploit having taken so long. Rust (which, as you say, is no silver bullet) is one data point showing Mozilla&#x27;s commitment to security, but the variance in the time to fixing exploits is worth consideration. Today&#x27;s exploit was fixed in one day, SVG took 18 months. Why? Did Moz do a good job at prioritizing based on the severity / availability of exploits in the wild, or was the long time to SVG fix just caused by technical difficulties? I don&#x27;t know, maybe a mozillian involved can comment.",1438956441

You come out strongly in favor of BLAKE, but without <i>any</i> consideration of its security properties, just &quot;it&#x27;s faster&quot;.<p>BLAKE uses the same basic construction as MD5 and SHA1, neither of which is a responsible choice for a collision-resistant hash function any more. While attacks producing collisions have not been presented, this construction means it&#x27;s susceptible to some other attacks. There are well-understood ways to avoid these attacks, but a naive usage of BLAKE2 in a production system will likely leave you open to length extension attacks in particular.<p>Keccak, on the other hand, uses the novel sponge construction, which injects content into the hash (absorb phase) and then iterates a threshing function (squeeze phase). This construction specifically addresses security concerns which BLAKE2 simply doesn&#x27;t.<p>To be clear: I do think the BLAKE developers made a good contribution to the security community: particularly, using ChaCha makes their algorithm very fast, and I suspect that the next generation of fast collision-resistant hash functions will use ChaCha in the sponge construction. There are situations where BLAKE is a better choice than SHA3. But its use requires a great deal of knowledge and care to be secure, and for the average person implementing a secure system, SHA3 is a much more responsible choice.<p>Security should not be taken lightly. Bad security can expose people&#x27;s private information and get people jailed, doxxed, and sometimes even killed. Glibly claiming BLAKE is better without any discussion of the security properties of the algorithms is completely irresponsible.",1438956194

And, when Carmack is stuck, I cannot but believe there are intricacies that I could not hope to understand at play.

Python and Perl and Java all have huge ecosystems, but one of the few places where programs written in all those languages can come together is the shell.  By &quot;real programming language&quot; I don&#x27;t mean some monstrosity with its own packages and whatnot.  I just mean a simple principled language to tie things together that doesn&#x27;t feel like a Turing tarpit.<p>Second, its highest priority is efficient interactive (REPL) use (although, as a &quot;real language&quot;, it should be much better than bash for scripts as well).  Some languages have good REPLs, but most don&#x27;t, and there are important design considerations for them.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re banging out a one-liner where you have some data and make a series of transformations on it - thinking through each step in turn - you don&#x27;t want to have to write functions in reverse order of application, third(second(first(data))).  With pipelines, it&#x27;s forward, first | second | third.  In a batch program (in both imperative and functional languages, though more often in imperative), you might avoid this by performing each step as a separate statement, assigning each result to a descriptive variable.  But interactively, who has time for variable names?  (The elvish author makes a similar argument in the readme.)  Yet few languages support this outside of OOP dot syntax, which only works in a subset of cases.",1406427555

It&#x27;s clear that we see eye-to-eye on two of the fundamental tenets of the Rainforest Connection project, namely:<p>1) The Internet of Things need not wait years for specialized, embeddable hardware. Discarded smartphones offer an immediate shortcut that most developers are able to leverage almost immediately. They&#x27;re chock full of sensors with mature APIs and built to be power efficient and reliable.<p>2) Surveillance is a  emotional issue, but (to me) it has a different meaning when the hardware and software that produces the data are entirely open-source, and—most importantly—the data feeds produced are made immediately available to anyone who desires access. My hope is that Rainforest Connection will not be interpreted as &quot;spy-[ware]&quot; but rather as an open connection between the forest and those around the world. Forks of the project may be used for other purposes, but at its core, the project is about streaming audio/sensor data openly, and building modules for analyzing the data for distinct patterns (the first example of which is illegal logging).<p>If either of those statements doesn&#x27;t make sense based on the Make article, I&#x27;d encourage you to check out the Kickstarter project page which contains a lot more information about our overall vision and activities:<p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/topherwhite/rainforest-connection-phones-turned-to-forest-guar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/topherwhite/rainforest-...</a>",1406427514

I know they have every right, legally, to do this, but to me it seems .. exploitative.</i><p>they saw a market nobody was catering to, and despite being based around a free tool, they're not just exploiting the community.  they provide a lot of free git hosting for a lot of projects, and you have to give them some credit for that.<p>and as far as i'm aware, most of their site is based upon a ruby re-implementation of the git tools that can manipulate the git meta files.  that was written by someone involved with the site and is open source, so they are also contributing back to the git/ruby community that way.",1235116750

Normally only practitioners can stay. But I also had the goal of teaching science and computers to whoever was interested, and there are 500 children and teenagers here.<p>I'm sure you could find a monastery to stay in. For all the rigidity of the core monastic rules, I have found them to be remarkably flexible and pragmatic about daily life. If you're interested, email me.

About 5 minutes later I went to play with the settings again, the daytime setting (my monitor's default) was blinding! I've been running it for 15 minutes now, the orange tint is barely noticeable. I think I really like this, will try it for a few days.",1235116604

I don’t get caught up in arguing anything that is based only on belief or opinion. Believe whatever you like.<p>In your definition of ‘scientist’ do you include medical doctors?<p>During a period of seriously ill health I saw a clutter of ‘ highly respected specialists ‘ — by some!  In the course of which I was told with varying degrees of anger and arrogance that: acupuncture; chiropractic treatment and hypnosis did not work, could not work and that those who believed in them were either idiots or delusional.<p>Interestingly the attempts, by those who bothered, to explain results obtained  were so far off the planet that tooth fairies, father christmas and honest politicians were decidedly ordinary every day events.<p>Then there is a book, forbidden science where people like the Wright Brothers,  Thomas Edison and a host of others were written off as either delusional or charlatans, perhaps both, or  worse by the scientists of their day.<p>(Everybody knew that heavier than air machines could not fly! )",1235116072

Yes, probably. Has it been done ? Probably not.<p>The age of the individual would not really factor in to the equation at all imo.",1235116009

I think that is up to how you use the internet, if you take a subject and then go in depth I think it is very well possible to learn a lot.<p>I also think that each of the sites above has something going for it, digg because it literally has just about everything on it (even though the crowd there is absolutely terrible), ./ because it has a very easy way of limiting the discussion to just those parts that are somewhat interesting with the capability to 'drill down' in a thread if you want to, HN because of the general quality of the discussion.<p>However, I doubt HN will be able to preserve its current culture without some major moves.",1235114672

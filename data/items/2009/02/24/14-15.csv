A way of signaling quality of publications that is more useful than 'it made it through the committee at some conference/journal/etc' would be a major improvement for researchers.<p>The graph analysis is even more interesting - this is a way around the problem that publication decisions can be made based on reviews written by less-well-read grad students instead of the faculty one might prefer to hear from.<p>One question though - it seems like if this guy really wanted to sell the idea, he'd point us to at least one instance of it being used. All it'd take is asking someone to review an existing paper of his (or something). It'd be great to tinker with the review graph analysis, for example.<p>Why not even share a signed review of the project itself?\nI tried to generate one for this post, but it doesn't seem to work on OS X, so I filed a bug instead.",1235487135

The combination of legislation that prevents companies from lowering the earnings of older employees, and of legislation that prevents mandatory retirement in some occupations, creates a major rigidity in the market for older workers.</i><p>Brilliant.  Build a system that rewards workers with retirement, yet subtly place incentives to encourage them to keep working (less).   Albeit, they are also working for less $, but at this point, the holistic benefits of having employment probably outweigh the dollar amount.",1235487002

493079,comment,491936,491936,0,0,bradgessler,,,"Here is how I go through resumes from developers:<p>(1) Sort resumes in order from least amount of pages (on the top) to the most amount of pages (on the bottom). The resumes with the lesser amount of pages get priority (I've seen 12 pagers... the quals on it were from a complete bozo). I'll throw out anything over 3-4 pages.<p>(2) Throw out resumes that list every programming language since 1982 (this halves the resume stack) or a list of languages the person is ""familiar with"" (when will head hunters stop telling their applicants to list this crap?)<p>(3) I could care less about GPA as long as its over 3.0; I look for diversity at this point. Was this person an English major or a CS major? Does this person code outside of work? Are they experimenting with other languages/technologies? Does this person travel quite a bit?<p>(4) Now its time to more carefully read the resume. I'll actually look at the experiences to make sure they're being honest and not making stupid claims like, ""Save over $10mm in costs from writing code X"".<p>(5) Next up is the phone interview where I ask simple questions to make sure the applicant can communicate clearly, knows what regex is (this questions throws a lot of applicants to the way-side), and verify a few claims on their resume. I had one person claim they knew about DOA web-services and another guy who had ""HTTP"" listed on his resume and didn't even know what an HTTP verb was. Another more clever guy was actually Googling shit as I was asking him a question (I can hear your keyboard!).",1235486916

493074,comment,492450,492564,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Well just to throw it up for consideration, I think granting exclusive rights to a work for ""life + 70 years"" for an individual and 120 years for a corporation is rather absurd. If the point of copyright was really to encourage artists/writers to produce content, don't you think 25 years would be sufficient time to capitalize on a work? Although I'd even settle for simply ""life"". The original copyright terms (in 1790) were 14 years with an option to extend once for 14 more.<p>The current system is in place so corporate copyright owners can continue to profit off their long-dead artist's creations... <i>ahem</i> Disney. Nothing made since 1923 has entered the public domain.<p>So yeah, the MPAA/RIAA definitely make bone-headed enforcement decisions, but the underlying system is also broken.",1235486612

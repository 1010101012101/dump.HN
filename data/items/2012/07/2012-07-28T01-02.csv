But Gnome just didn't have the same marketing positioning.<p>I'm all for modernizing interfaces.

4304417,comment,4300472,4304397,3,0,sho_hn,,,"Getting people's attention with a beta is unfortunately pretty hard. Two things:<p>a) It's not all about beta <i>testing</i>. A big thing is developer recruitment. The demographics among FOSS developers ensure a relatively high amount of turnover: Many of them are at an age where their life and/or job situation is likely to change within two-three years, causing them to move on. A steady influx of new talent is needed to keep the show on the road.<p>At the same time, a project that isn't releasing is less attractive to contributors for a variety of reasons: The time it will take for your handiwork to be delivered into user's hands, the level of information circulating about contribution opportunities (i.e. ""what does this even do that I might want to hack on""), et cetera. It's also still true that a lot of FOSS contribution is itch-driven: You start contributing because what you're using isn't doing quite what you need it to. But if you're not using it, if there's no exposure, there's no way for the itch to happen. And usage explodes with a real release vs. a beta.<p>b) People don't test betas, relatively speaking. The amount of feedback explodes for an actual release. Now you'd think that beta feedback would be of higher quality on average (due to people who actually do test betas being more advanced users), but even expert users often hold back on betas despite knowing better.",1343440364

4304399,comment,4304165,4304165,9,0,dmvaldman,,,"more like a verbose explanation of Bayes' Theorem...<p>I'll give my succinct spin: Throw a coin in the air 10 times. Say 6 times the coin lands heads up, and 4 times tails up.<p>A Bayesian would say: the most likely explanation is that the coin is biased in favor of heads with Prob(heads) = .6 and Prob(tails) = .4. Because given such a model, the chance of this outcome is 25% (10 choose 6 * .6^6 * .4^4). Less likely is the explanation that the coin is fair.<p>A Frequentist would begin by assuming a model, likely that the coin is fair. She would then argue that the probability of getting 6 heads in 10 tosses is about 21% (10 choose 6 * 1/2^10), and she would have tools (number of STDs from the mean, etc) to test how much of an outlier this observation was, in order to validate her model.<p>In summary, the Bayesian considers many models at once, and asks how likely are they given the observations. A Frequentist starts with one model, and asks how likely is the observation.<p>The Frequentist uses the scientific method: develop a hypothesis, then test it. The Bayesian does something else, which I think is better, but ill-defined. She somehow tests all hypotheses at once, and puts different confidences in each.",1343439796

Ditto Vista and Win 7. The pattern is not limited to FOSS.<p>I think the lesson here is that the circumstances at times compel platform vendors like KDE and Gnome to make these big next-gen releases, and the market compels them to do them before they're quite ready for end-user primetime, because the alternative is a serious loss of momentum, e.g. in the third-party space that is waiting for that release. And this is likely even more true in the FOSS space, because you're not just bleeding third-party interest by not shipping, but also developer recruitment.<p>It's a balancing act. Looking back, I don't think we found quite the right balance with KDE 4.0. But realistically, shipping 4.0 only when it had achieved the quality level, of, say KDE 4.5 just wasn't going to happen, either. Because if we hadn't shipped at some point, we'd might not have gotten the influx of contributors and early adopter feedback that we needed to make 4.5 happen.<p>Really, people are being presumptuous by saying these things happen carelessly. The reality is that there are pressures pulling you into different directions. You sometimes make bad calls under pressure.

The subtleties of the proper definition are likely to be more confusing than enlightening to a beginner.<p>But even the rigorous definition is still a ""rise"" term f(x+h) - f(x) divided by a ""run"" term h.

If I remember correctly, his explanation was something along the lines of this: a truly random playlist is not desirable to most users, which challenges the claim ""I do believe the ordering is truly random the first time it's generated"" in the top answer. Mlodinow explains that most people really <i>don't</i> understand randomness, and a ""truly random"" playlist might have the same song twice in a row, play a few songs from the same album in the normal order, and things like that. Some people don't realize that rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 on a die in order is as likely as 6,4,1,2,5,3 even though the second set of outcomes might seem more likely because it looks more random. To outcount for this, iTunes actually does use an algorithm to make the shuffled playlist ""better"" than a truly random one.<p>Of course, by some definitions, even rand() isn't random enough, so I can see why people argue about it. The book doesn't even provide a rigorous definition of the concept, but it was never intended to be a serious treatise on statistics.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/books/review/Johnson-G-t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/books/review/Johnson-G-t.h...</a>",1343438128

This is the line that separates a very good, but very green programmer from a guru-level senior.<p>> <i>""I guess I should ask if you've even went to or been in a college.""</i><p>Yes. And let me tell you, those 4-man projects they have you working on are <i>nothing</i> like working in a software shop. Hell, it's not even very much like working in a 4-man startup, where the bulk of your day becomes architectural, business, and product-focused.<p>I'll be impressed the day they can craft a CS curriculum that even remotely approximates the actual dynamics of professional software work.<p>> <i>""You seem to have incredibly high and almost unmeetable standards that would actually require a college grad.""</i><p>Note that I didn't say that you absolutely <i>won't</i> get a job without prior professional experience. You may, but your road is going to be unnecessarily difficult. For every one of ""you"" (i.e., someone with a great deal of self-hacking, and presumably did well in school, but lacks real professional experience) there are <i>tens of thousands</i> who went the other route. I've been through the fresh-grad hiring cycle several times now, and companies <i>will</i> go into bidding wars with each other for the graduates with prior internship experience.<p>Everyone else is just picking at the scraps - not particularly slim scraps mind you, but you are <i>not</i> treated like an A-player. This may be an unfair judgment, but such is the state of the industry. Hiring is an incredibly difficult task, and most means of judging skill are incredibly noise-heavy.

You can ship product and code without going to school for it - and many people do. I've hired one or two, and worked with many more - they are pragmatic programmers who are well-rounded. They <i>will</i> be rough around the edges on the CS side, but that's something you can fix with experience and training.<p>A CS degree has a relatively low correlation with being a capable programmer. A lot lower than one would expect anyhow, especially since the <i>vast</i> majority of code being written in this industry do <i>not</i> delve into CS fundamentals very often.<p>> <i>""If you're telling me you are willing to pick programmers up off the street expecting them to know software engineering concepts like scalability, modeling, and being on a development schedule.""</i><p>Lots of people graduate from college (or don't go at all) knowing this. That's why we pay them the big bucks - this is the demographic that's being courted by all sides by multiple companies throwing $150K+ numbers into the air. Yes, for a fresh undergrad.<p>You know how, as a programmer, you leave school knowing this?<p>You ship product. You ship it a lot, either on your own, or you do it as part of internships with other companies, or you join active open source projects with strong leadership. You <i>do not</i> learn this from hacking on class projects or assignments.<p>> <i>""Programmers who've got a couple of projects under their belt that probably involved no human contact and probably aren't even that good due to lack of formal training.""</i><p>Formal training is the most overrated part of software engineering, really. Software is <i>absolutely</i> a trade, and is realistically not unlike plumbing or carpentry. Lots of hustle along with experience are <i>much</i> more valuable than academic knowledge. And who do you think has a more realistic experience with human contact in software: the guy who's shipped product as part of a team, or the guy who got assigned to a group assignment and hacked it out in a week?<p>> <i>""And you are willing to train them to be up to par""</i><p>Oh yeah, we are. Because they are <i>way</i> further along than a green CS grad with no experience. They have experience <i>shipping code</i>, which is the <i>hardest</i> thing to learn, and encompasses a huge number of skills. The whole ""not having super amazing CS knowledge"" part is fixable, particularly if you have strong mentorship and guidance.

I've used Emacs, Vim and Eclipse so far, and all of them seem at the same time appealing and defficient, each has something cool other two lack, and something that really sucks. (For example I love that I can has Haskell repl open as buffer in Emacs, but I hate Emacs keybindings). There are also a few editors I haven't tried yet (which I should do), and I'm aware that all of those I tried are customizable by plugins. Perhaps a huge pack of vim plugins would be solution here; but maybe we need some new concepts about editing, browsing and running code? I believe there are lots of things to try out there, and I hope that LightTable will deliver some new great tools, the kind of 'obvious in hindsight' ideas, that you can't live without once you tried them.",1343437567

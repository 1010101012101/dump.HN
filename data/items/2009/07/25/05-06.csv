You guys are typically not the ignorant masses, who gives a damn what lacquer is used on your notebook, do you use it so you can sit back and stare longingly at it or so you can <i>use</i> the thing? Who cares what it looks like!<p>I recently was given the opportunity as a reward from my employer to name my next notebook, it could be anything at all, I didn't have any set price limit, I specifically got asked to just pick whatever would be the ""ultimate"" in computing power for me. I had a look at the mbp lines, did a few enquiries on notebookforums, and ended up with <a href=""http://www.p4laptops.com.au/main/D900F_P4laptops.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.p4laptops.com.au/main/D900F_P4laptops.pdf</a><p>It looks like a big, black laptop, the vast majority of reviews I could find on it spent about 50% of the article pointing out how it was not very pretty and size and other form factor related nonsense I didn't care about, then another 25% raving on about how heavy and loud it is, and then the last 25% of the article actually examining how the tool performs for it's intended purpose! Man I hate the world at times, you people are all f*cking crazy. It's like I bought a fork and spent all my time pointing out how it wasn't very well chromed and I didn't like the way it sat in my hand, and then just toward the end there mentioned ""but hell, it's really good for picking up food""<p>Eugh.",1248501484

General bugginess all over the place, particularly with non-x86 platforms.  The number of failed unit tests for ffmpeg with gcc 4.4 on PPC64 was staggering.<p>Of course, commercial compilers are buggy as well, so this is not really exclusive to GCC; the latest ICC miscompiles large chunks of ffmpeg and Mans has been quite busy submitting bug reports for armcc.<p>3.  Tendency to get worse with every new release; this trend was finally reversed with 4.3 and 4.4, the latter of which was the first compiler to beat 2.9.5 in performance (in ffmpeg, at least):<p><a href=""http://multimedia.cx/eggs/last-performance-smackdown-for-awhile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://multimedia.cx/eggs/last-performance-smackdown-for-awh...</a><p>4.  Tendency to declare obvious bugs to be not bugs; for example, failures in the register allocator for inline assembly in which it couldn't allocate 7 registers for the inline assembly <i>despite 7 registers being available</i> (but only inconsistently, on some platforms and some versions, for no apparent reason).  Don't have links to the gcc bugtracker on me for these.<p>5.  Incredibly bad optimization on non-x86 architectures.  ARM is a particularly horrendous example, where we found the following happening when compiling x264:<p>a) In the most important DSP function in the program, SATD, GCC unrolled the loop completely.  This is related to the fact that there are no loop unrolling heuristics for ARM--and instead of just disabling loop unrolling, the decision is binary (""fully unrolled"" vs ""not unrolled""), with the former being far too heavily weighted in favor of.<p>b) GCC then completely failed to allocate registers correctly, resulting in an enormous number of unnecessary loads/stores to the stack.<p>c) The function's speed <i>was cut in half</i> due to this.<p>Other issues include GCC's inability to consistently use the ARM's ""free shift,"" up to and including putting shifts on register X right next to another op on register X despite the ability of even a simple peephole optimizer to merge the two instructions.<p>Also, GCC seems generally bad at three-operand architectures; one will find many redundant moves between registers on ARM, which generally should almost never exist in a three-operand instruction set.  Here's an example similar to something I've seen (I don't recall the exact instructions):<p>add r0, r0, r7<p>mov r1, r0<p>mov r0, [r3]<p>Clearly, this example can be reduced to:<p>add r1, r0, r7<p>mov r0, [r3]",1248501272

723033,comment,722239,722352,0,0,10ren,,,"You're absolutely right. The cartoon only mentions qualitative factors. If the business has been doing well, and those factors are present (and other explanations are absent), then it's a reasonable bet that those factors are the reasons for the the business's success. You can then examine each of these factors in isolation and assess how likely they are to continue in future.<p>With these qualitative factors settled, you can look at the numbers, especially the <i>rate</i> of growth of profit, and assume that they will continue (taking into account how sure you are of this), and calculate what the business is worth based on extrapolating that growth. Extrapolation is easy.<p>As a contrast, consider companies during a boom. Explosive growth, even in profitability, but... Another contrast is high tech companies, which can be extraordinarily profitable, but their long-term success has proven hard to predict. Buffett says he <i>won't invest in something unless he understands it</i> - as a programmer, this is great to hear from someone who is so incredibly successful.<p>Now you know the secret.

723028,comment,722517,722711,0,0,Empact,,,"> Whereas a higher minimum wage means some people can be dropped from the rolls entirely while others have to collect more.<p>You're falling prey to the fallacy that Hazlitt describes, focusing on some specific group, and for the short run, when in fact they harm the people generally and the poor substantially and indefinitely via forced unemployment.<p>In the minimum wage case, with people forced out of work by a policy essentially making it economically untenable to hire certain low-skill workers, or as many of them, you have fewer people engaged in productive labor.  Society incurs a loss to its productive capacity, and our general level of abundance is reduced, including for those on the margin who aren't forced into unemployment.<p>Meanwhile, those who would be gaining skills and experience in the course of work are instead unemployed and idle.  This too detracts from our human capital over time, by reducing the skills and thus earning power of the poor, the ostensible benefactors of minimum wage laws.<p>This isn't a judgment call, it's exactly the sort of thinking Hazlitt warns against.",1248500205
723027,comment,722517,722714,0,0,trominos,,,"The problem isn't that the book isn't comprehensive or fails to comment on certain issues. It's that the book's logic isn't always sound because of its author's biases.<p>Look at the first example, ""The Broken Window."" The author describes a situation in which:<p>• Some kid breaks a baker's window.<p>• The crowd that gathers notes that, although unfortunate for the baker, the broken window will provide work for a glazier.<p>• The crowd fails to realize that the baker was planning to buy a suit, and the work provided for the glazier is counterbalanced by the work lost by the tailor. Also the baker's out a suit.<p>That's all well and good, but the author never considers the scenario where the baker is wealthy and losing $250 will not affect his spending habits (over at least the course of decades). Then the broken window actually results in $250 of created work for the glazier without any corresponding loss of work elsewhere (by e.g. the tailor) or loss of value (by e.g. the baker, who in the book's scenario couldn't buy a suit because of the broken window). In this scenario, the broken window is actually a net win for the community.<p>Nor does he consider the scenario where the baker is poor but thrifty and tends to save what he has. This is a very complex situation: in the short run the thrifty baker's spending habits will probably be unchanged by having to replace a window (or at least negligibly changed relative to the $250 that he was forced to spend), but in the long run he probably will end up spending about $250 less because of what he shelled out to the glazier, and moreover will fail to procure some items of value about $250. So then the math goes like this: because of the broken window, the glazier gains $250 dollars of work today. But some other worker loses $250 of work down the line, and the baker, in the long run, loses some items of value $250.<p>The thing is, spending $250 today creates more work than spending $250 next year, because the money will keep circulating, so it's not easy to demonstrate that the broken window is either helpful or harmful to the community here. (Note: spending $250 today instead of next year has a host of other effects, like increased inflation, that I obviously didn't mention. I don't mean to make a full analysis of these scenarios, just to point out that the author didn't make a full analysis of them himself.)<p>And a more glaring failure of logic in the second applied lesson: the author says, ""No man would want to have his own property destroyed either in war or in peace. What is harmful or disastrous to an individual must be equally harmful or disastrous to the collection of individuals that make up a nation.""<p>That's just not true. (A slightly ridiculous counterexample: when a serial killer dies of a heart attack, the nation he lives in is probably bettered.)<p>(In spite of all this, I still kind of liked the book.)",1248499891

723004,comment,722855,722855,0,0,mediaman,,,"The problem facing the newspaper industry is a similar problem facing the airline industry. It is one reason why the airline industry has had terrible economics since Kitty Hawk.<p>At first, the newspaper business model was this: there were many competitors, and each competitor faced a mix of fixed costs (staff, printing facilities) and variable costs (paper, ink, delivery). All was fine, because nobody would give away product that had real cost associated with it.<p>But then the variable cost disappeared. No more paper, no more ink, no more delivery. Suddenly, the only thing left was fixed costs. And all the competitors realized they could start undercutting the next guy, while still making some infinitesimal incremental profit on each viewer. Of course, that incremental profit does not amount to enough to pay for all those fixed costs (staff) that still exist. And hence the problem we have today.<p>Airlines face the same problem. Fixed schedules and a low cost per incremental seat. So there are always price wars going on to ""buy"" seats from competitors. But then they can't make up for their fixed costs, and they go out of business.<p>Without the introduction of variable costs into web content, the newspaper industry will resemble the airline industry: it will rarely make money, and, on net, probably destroy most shareholder dollars invested in it. People will keep talking about erecting pay walls, or fixing the system, but there will always be the next guy who will be willing to provide the same thing for free to grab all those viewers.",1248498105

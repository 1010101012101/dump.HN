One of the most important factors, if not the most important one, contributing to the wild growth of WeChat in China is almost everyone online has at least one QQ number connecting with acquaintances. I think QQ was not as dominant as now. MSN messenger was quite popular among young middle class. In fact, the two are mainly used by different classes. After the shutdown of MSN messenger and the rise of domestic organizations (my personal perspective though), QQ seems to be the only dominant force in the market.<p>edit: typo and added: In fact, the two are mainly used by different classes.",1427759997

9293469,comment,9291040,9291040,0,0,F_J_H,,,"Philip Larkin has been mentioned already in this thread. The following two poems by Larkin inspire me in a backwards sort of way.<p>This first one, &quot;Next, Please&quot; reminds me that we can&#x27;t just wait for something amazing to happen in our lives, thinking that some day it surely will all on its own.  We need to be proactive and make things happen.<p><pre><code>  Next, Please\n\n  Always too eager for the future, we\n  Pick up bad habits of expectancy.\n  Something is always approaching; every day\n  Till then we say,\n\n  Watching from a bluff the tiny, clear\n  Sparkling armada of promises draw near.\n  How slow they are! And how much time they waste,\n  Refusing to make haste!\n\n  Yet still they leave us holding wretched stalks\n  Of disappointment, for, though nothing balks\n  Each big approach, leaning with brasswork prinked,\n  Each rope distinct,\n\n  Flagged, and the figurehead with golden tits\n  Arching our way, it never anchors; it&#x27;s\n  No sooner present than it turns to past.\n  Right to the last\n\n  We think each one will heave to and unload\n  All good into our lives, all we are owed\n  For waiting so devoutly and so long.\n  But we are wrong:\n\n  Only one ship is seeking us, a black-\n  Sailed unfamiliar, towing at her back\n  A huge and birdless silence. In her wake\n  No waters breed or break.\n</code></pre>\nSecond is Larkin&#x27;s Poem &quot;To Failure&quot;, which remindes me that I likely will not fail spectacularly, but slowly everyday, almost without notice, when I let the day slip away without achieving at least one small step towards a goal.<p><pre><code>  To Failure\n\n  You do not come dramatically, with dragons\n  That rear up with my life between their paws  \n  And dash me butchered down beside the wagons,\n  The horses panicking; nor as a clause\n  Clearly set out to warn what can be lost,\n  What out-of-pocket charges must be borne,\n  Expenses met; nor as a draughty ghost\n  That’s seen, some mornings, running down a lawn.\n\n  It is these sunless afternoons, I find,\n  Instal you at my elbow like a bore.\n  The chestnut trees are caked with silence. I’m\n  Aware the days pass quicker than before,\n  Smell staler too. And once they fall behind\n  They look like ruin. You have been here some time.\n</code></pre>\nFinally, as technical people, we can get so absorbed in what we are doing that we forget the importance of fostering the relationships around us with those we love:<p><pre><code>  Without Mercy, the Rains Continued (by David St. John)\n\n  There had been \n  A microphone hidden\n\n  Beneath the bed \n  Of course I didn&#x27;t realize it\n\n  At the time & in fact \n  Didn&#x27;t know for years\n\n  Until one day a standard \n  Khaki book mailer\n\n  Arrived & within it \n  An old\n\n  Stained cassette tape \n  Simply labeled in black marker\n\n  &quot;Him / Me / September 1975&quot; \n  & as I listened I knew something\n\n  Had been asked of me \n  Across the years & loneliness\n\n  To which I simply responded \n  With the same barely audible\n\n  Silence that I had chosen then</code></pre>",1427759883

If you need to test those microservices in more ways you need more people to support the testing infrastructure.  For engineers it&#x27;s the amount of friction felt when trying to move around and work on new and different problems in your company because they&#x27;re one of five people who knows how the hell the Java infrastructure works.<p>If you have an existing testing and deployment infrastructure etc. your team gets those for free and doesn&#x27;t need to reinvent (and support) those wheels.<p>> As long as there are sufficient hire-able engineers who know that technology, it can be used.<p>Yikes.

9293456,comment,9289612,9292622,0,0,roymurdock,,,"This is wrong. 3.3m workers work for the minimum wage in the US. This represents 2.6% of all wage and salary workers in the economy [0]. Raising the minimum wage would simply make 2.6% of the working population better off at the expense of their employers. It&#x27;s a redistribution of wealth and it has nothing to do with inflation.<p>You have your causation backwards. Employers being forced to pay a higher wage to 2.6% of the working force does not cause the money supply to increase. Central bank monetary policy causes the money supply to increase, creating inflation. Wages increase in order to preserve purchasing power in an inflationary economy. This is why the markets hang on the Fed&#x27;s every word - the Fed has the power to change interest rates and inflation which, in turn, effects the labor market.<p>To address your point about deflation: QE was designed to support bank balance sheets by removing risky and opaque assets and replacing them with liquidity. Banks now have a ton of liquidity [1], but no investment-worthy projects. Thus they choose to hold their reserves with central banks, choosing a negative interest rate over the risk of lending in the economy. Wages are falling because there is less money in the economy chasing an increasing amount of goods. Therefore money is appreciating in value. Once banks resume lending out the liquidity they have been injected with we will see wages rise.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/08/who-makes-minimum-wage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/08/who-makes-mi...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=15Y1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1...</a>",1427759710

9293453,comment,9292831,9292976,0,0,tomjakubowski,,,"Okay, this is not really on-topic at all. But someone has finally given me the opening to rant about the state of public restroom design :-)<p>I spend a lot of time working out of cafes, both for my job and when I&#x27;m working on some personal project. ~4-8 hours a day in a cafe plus a coffee every 90 minutes or so and plenty of water means I have a lot of experience with coffee shop public restrooms. And almost all of them are terribly designed.<p>The worst problem, common to almost all cafes, is that a place with a capacity of ~40 people or so will have two single-user <i>gendered</i> restrooms. By this I mean there is a label or picture on each door indicating &quot;Male&quot; or &quot;Female&quot;.  This is a problem for a number of reasons, including that it creates issues for trans and genderqueer people, but also that it inevitably creates situations where there is a queue for one restroom (because of a user who is taking their time, for whatever reason) while the other is empty. Of course, someone could jump out of the queue and use the empty restroom, but there&#x27;s a social norm that we generally must abide that forbids this.<p>Another inefficiency is that faucets for washing up tend to be locked in the same single-user room as toilets. This  causes backups when a person needs to use the faucet but someone else is using the toilet or vice versa. Plenty of people just pop into a single-user restroom to adjust their hair or wash their hands or whatever.<p>In something like 9 years of working consistently out of cafes, I&#x27;ve seen just two that have what I consider to be well-designed restroom facilities: the Starbucks at Main & Olympic in Santa Monica, CA, USA and Sightglass Coffee in SoMa, San Franciso, CA, USA. Each have an open, shared sink area with a glut of faucets and two to four single-user toilets behind locked doors opening out into it. I&#x27;ve never seen a line for the restrooms at these cafes, although I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because of good design or because no one wants to use such weird restrooms ;-)",1427759682

I&#x27;m not a big fan of C#, but CLR would have been better. Even <i>JavaScript</i> would have been better. But an intermediate VM language (like the LLVM intermediate representation) would have been the best option, if CPU architecture targeting were the concern.<p>I do games, primarily. And writing games in Java (which is what Google tells you to do -- though they finally gave in to pressure and added the NDK) just sucks, because you have to ship the JDK when shipping on <i>every other platform</i> -- or you need to write your game twice.<p>So pretty much every major game uses C/C++ <i>despite</i> it being the ugly stepchild of Android. Google set up the dev environment so that you can add as many target architectures as you want, making your APK &quot;fat&quot;, or alternately shipping various APKs with different architectures in them and letting the store pick the appropriate version. Which works, but is ugly.<p>C and C++ have been CPU-architecture-independent for a long time, and if they DIDN&#x27;T want to force the multi-binary approach, using LLVM to build to an intermediate language and compiling for each platform would have been an even better fix.<p>Intel and MIPS are <i></i>not<i></i> first-class citizens, by the way, because the NDK exists, and many developers still only ship ARM binaries. And while other platforms ship with ARM emulators, they&#x27;re buggy: An app I&#x27;m currently working on just fails on MIPS, and there are few enough people with MIPS devices that the client decided to just not support MIPS (our build process uses libraries that aren&#x27;t build using the Android.mk system, so I can&#x27;t just add &quot;mips&quot; to the platform list).",1427759398

If you need liquidity, real estate is not for you. For a tiny period of time that&#x27;s a rounding error in the history of real estate ownership, yes you could buy a house and see a 100% value increase in a year. But going in expecting that isn&#x27;t investment, it&#x27;s speculation (see: bitcoin&#x27;s run up and crash).<p>The value in real estate - in any true investment - is over the long term. I&#x27;m talking decades, not years and certainly not months. For a primary residence it&#x27;s worth it just to keep your housing payment steady. Your $3k mortgage payment is going to be $3k today, tomorrow, and forever until you pay it off. What&#x27;s $3k in rent today going to be in 30 years? Nobody could say for sure, but I&#x27;d bet everything I own it&#x27;ll be more than $3k.<p>But as with any investment vehicle, you have to choose what&#x27;s right for your risk profile and your liquidity needs. Don&#x27;t invest in a startup if you need your capital back in 2 months, and don&#x27;t buy a house if you need to liquidate it in a year.

You pull out the very few area where the rich still have an edge, but the fact is that in the vast majority of areas, the rich have lost insane ground.<p>First, these physical, tangible standard of living factors you so arrogantly dismiss. Cheap, ubiquitous travel means freedom to live where you want, even if that&#x27;s more than a few hundred miles away, without sacrificing your family and friends. That was rare 20 years ago and almost unheard of 50 years ago. Except if you were rich, of course. Today, the rich can buy somewhat more comfortable and convenient flights, at extreme expense, but not faster ones.<p>As for refrigerators in every home? The alternative is shopping for fresh ingredients daily, or doing without them. You can&#x27;t save leftovers for very long, so you need to cook daily. And speaking of cooling? 100 years ago, the king of England couldn&#x27;t get an A/C unit at any cost, today they&#x27;re perfectly ubiquitous.<p>Education? Yeah, there is some real differences here, but the bottom has gone up tremendously: in living memory, kids were pulled from school to help in the fields. Poor kids, obviously, the rich didn&#x27;t go in the fields. Today, thanks to the mechanisation of agriculture, all kids can stay in school uninterrupted. And even the poorest kids can read by almost free electrical lights. Even 100 years ago, the rich would have to read by candlelight.<p>The rich can buy marginally better cars than you and I, but not by a lot. Fancier, but not really better clothes. Their houses might be bigger and fancier, but not more capable at keeping you and your family warm (or cool) and dry. Certainly, the rich have more luxurious options, but not really a lot better.<p>The richest man on earth can&#x27;t buy a better smartphone than me or get a better signal than me - that&#x27;s why those ghastly diamond-encrusted phones exist. But their text messages don&#x27;t arrive faster than mine and they like the exact same cat videos as me on the exact same Facebook.<p>Still too vulgar and consumerist? How about the environment? Once, the rich enjoyed clean air, clean water and safe disposal of sewage by living in the country. But do you know why they dusted all the time in old books? Indoor coalfires are messy affairs. If you lived in the city (rich or poor), there would be no clean water, smoggy, dirty air and literally shit flowing in the streets. Today, even the worst tenements in the densest cities have clean, running water, flushing toilets and smogless radiators. The air might not be quite as clean as it could be, but it&#x27;s a far cry from the smog-hell it once was - and a lot cleaner than just a few decades ago, thanks to better cars.<p>The perks you list were always perks of the nobility, they are not recent gains - but you&#x27;re making the perfect an enemy of the extremely good. The much more interesting point is all the perks they&#x27;ve lost and are losing, and those are extremely numerous.",1427758272

I'm glad you are voicing your concern, I'm really concerned about how comfortable we've grown with the concept of debt.  It's a dangerous position to be in, with the Federal Reserve owning as much assets as they do (and they will continue to purchase more, as the Bailout gave them the powers to do so).",1223833811

330400,comment,328841,329930,0,0,anamax,,,"> My point was, however poorly made with the Gates example, that I doubt that the thought, other loopholes aside, is to eliminate capital gains tax for people that are deemed to be ""rich"".<p>I think that it's silly to consider ""the thought"".  We should look at where we actually are and what is likely to actually happen if we make proposed changes.<p>Part of ""where we actually are"" is that the very rich don't pay estate taxes and can work around cap gains taxes, so evaluating cap gains proposals based on their effects on the very rich is silly.<p>Instead, we should look at people who are actually paying cap gains (and estate taxes for that matter).",1223833241

The people with the sinking options start to wonder why the guy next to them is leaving early each week to head out on his yacht, while you're stuck working extra hard to try to earn a 10% boost in your base salary next year.
I believe Gates said something once about how offering options in the MS early years was one of his biggest regrets - exactly for this reason.",1223833026

The US started the uprising against France in Vietnam?  The US started whatever it was that consumed Eritria/Ethiopia in the 70s/80s?   The US started all of the Saharan and sub Saharan""skirmishes""?  The US started Darfur?  The US started Bosnia?<p>The US did manage to win the cold war, no thanks to the beneficiaries.  Yes, I'm talking about Europe.  Now that they don't have anyone threatening them, they're talking smack.  When that changes, they'll tell us how they've always been our BFFs.  (Which will it be?  Russia?  China?  Their Islamic friends?)<p>It's well past time for the EU to take responsibility for things instead of telling the US how it should be done.  Surely there are some problems that are within their capabilities.  And, speaking of capabilities, shouldn't they have significant capabilities?  After all, they have 500M people and a greater GDP than the US.<p>However, the author is correct.  The US should let the rest of the world alone.  Whether the result is better or worse, they'll get what they want and deserve.",1223831956

In micro terms, household income could not service the debt on the house. None of the bailout schemes so far address that income issue. If they started mailing out checks to homeowners to help them pay their mortgages, they <i>can</i> stop house prices from falling, but at the cost of hyper-inflation. In chess terms, we are at an economic checkmate scenario - all options are bad. The least bad option may not be politically viable, so we have to consider really bad scenarios too. At this point it is unpredictable which of the bad choices will be made.<p>Here is a nightmare scenario: start to <i>really</i> worry if trade sanctions on China or outsourcing ban on India become a possibility. Such beggar-they-neighbor policies begot the Great Depression. We are not there yet, but how confident are you it won't happen once the US Congress gets ""serious""?",1223831309

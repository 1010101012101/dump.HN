Still, treatment of them at scale....<p>And the other thing is how do you define treatment?  Besides Tamiflu and the other neuraminidase inhibitor currently marketed, who&#x27;s efficacy is very questionable, treatment isn&#x27;t as I normally define it, it&#x27;s entirely supportive, including of course zapping secondary bacterial infections.<p>The 1918 pandemic aspirin poisoning hypothesis is interesting, but I think highly speculative, given all the places zapped that had limited if any aspirin availability, or so I assume for all those Pacific islands: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_pandemic_influenza#Devastated_communities"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_pandemic_influenza#Devast...</a>",1402610296

If you build a computer as they are suggesting, using non-volatile memory without a deep memory hierarchy, and with an optical interconnect that enables low-latency memory access across a datacenter, then that changes a huge number of the assumptions that led to the operating systems we have now. In order to really take advantage of such a machine, you really need to invent new operating systems. You can hack Linux to run on it, which is what they said they are doing, but you will lose some of the benefits of the hardware because the architecture assumptions are baked into the fundamental design of existing OSes. File systems are one example that is easy to think about. Virtual memory. But consider <i>anything</i> that an OS does and how this new architecture changes it. Consider loading executables to start a process, for example. If there is no difference between memory and disk, then you don&#x27;t even need to load executables into memory. All files would be memory-mapped in some huge global address space. Programs could jump from memory in one machine to a whole different machine (VM migration? HA?). It really changes everything. We would need new R&D, some of it very fundamental, in order to understand and build systems to take full advantage of such technology. That&#x27;s all HP is saying in this announcement.",1402609941

The naive solution to TSP has no applicability to anything - it&#x27;s purely a thought exercise in the same vein as &quot;why are manhole covers round&quot; and &quot;how many jelly beans are in this jar&quot;.<p>Remember that 10 years ago we thought <i>those</i> questions were &quot;predictors&quot; of programmer ability. Turns out that was full of crap.<p>So your notion of testing someone&#x27;s suitability for a job is to ask them to solve a problem unlike any they will encounter in the job, expecting them to generate a solution that would be wildly insufficient even <i>if</i> the problem was relevant to their job?<p>In the mean time I rarely see companies testing for abilities that <i>are</i> used on a regular basis in these jobs: the ability to architect, knowledge and familiarity with best practices and design patterns, writing testable code, etc etc. All of these skills are far from universal, but yet we spend no time ensuring they&#x27;re there. No, we blow the valuable 45-60 minutes we have with candidates twiddling around with TSP.<p>We ask candidates simplified things from what goes in IRL, because we don&#x27;t have all day. That can&#x27;t be helped - the least we can do is make sure what we ask is actually a simplified version of what the candidate will be responsible for, instead of simplified versions of things the candidate will never touch, ever.<p>> <i>&quot;Proving people know how to implement an algorithm [even one that is a pretty bad solution to TSP] seems relevant to me.&quot;</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t to me. More accurately, it doesn&#x27;t seem relevant to the majority of coding jobs out there.<p>In reality the number of jobs that <i>ever</i> involve implementing real algorithms is really low. Even in research-heavy companies like Google it&#x27;s limited to a small subset of employees in a small subset of teams.<p>The vast majority of everyone will not write a substantial algorithm from scratch in their day job.

In humans for a TNF receptor to move towards apoptosis it requires a &quot;Death Domain.&quot; In corals only 11 of the 40 TNF receptors have these death domains so the other 29 TNF receptors are likely involved in a variety of other cellular process besides apoptosis<p>Re DaniFong: &quot;simpler&quot; organisms do not always have shorter lifespans. For example many clams/molluscs can live to be hundreds of years old. In fact, the oldest mollusc is estimated to be over 400 years old!<p>Re: Why so many TNF receptors in coral there are variety of possibilites:<p>In terms of the biological reasons for so many TNF-receptors in coral there are a couple possibilities<p>1) Genome duplication events can occur during evolution leading to expansion of gene families. This appears to be the case in the Zebra fish model organism Danio rerio, they have 33 TNF receptors which seem to have appeared through genomic duplication. I did not specefically look for genome duplication events in the coral genome, but is an interesting direction for future research.<p>2) Microbial-host interactions- corals harbor a diverse assemblage of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and algae which changes in response to coral health. TNF receptors may be involved in managing these complex interactions. Of the 40 TNFR in coral, only 11 have a &quot;Death Domain&quot;. We hypothesize that these death domain TNFR are involved with directly guiding a cell towards apotosis which leaves 29 other receptors that may be involved with other cellular processes<p>3) Coral resilience to environmental stress- Recent work by Steve Palumni showed that TNF-receptors are involved with resilance to heat stress. They placed naturally heat resistant coral into cold water and found that expression levels of specefic TNF receptors were maintained in the heat-resistant coral but not the heat-sensitive coral. This suggests a genetic component to heat stress via TN-receptors.<p>If anybody has any questions about my paper, evolution, or coral in general please do not hesitate to ask me on Twitter @StevenQuistad<p>Thanks for your interest in my work!",1402608860

Last time I checked I saw a <i>lot</i> of 1BRs going for >$1500 in Capitol Hill. That&#x27;s a ~$1K a month difference from NYC rents, so if the New Yorker is earning ~$18K more (to account for tax) they&#x27;d be even already. As far as I can tell the pay gap is wider than this.<p>And this rate is going up, seemingly faster than salary growth in the city. The advantage may still be there, but in any case it&#x27;s being rapidly erased. The main thing Seattle has going for it financially now is the lack of state income tax, which genuinely makes a big dent compared to other tech hubs. A ~5-8% difference in overall taxation comes out to quite a bit.<p>Housing in NYC is expensive, but it&#x27;s less insane than most people know. The difference between a $1K apartment and a $2K apartment is 100%, but it&#x27;s also $12,000 a year. Does the pay gap between the two cities cover the difference? Does it actually put you ahead?<p>Side note: these &quot;cost of living index comparison&quot; sites are trash.

7886027,comment,7882729,7884877,2,0,JabavuAdams,,,"> It may be overdiagnosed in some children, but it can also be underdiagnosed. And the impact of not knowing what the hell is wrong with you is more devastating than anything I can think of.<p>This.<p>I skipped three grades in elementary school and was used to thinking of myself as a prodigy, but when it came time to study things that weren&#x27;t immediately interesting in University -- I kept feeling like I was fighting some &quot;other&quot;. Hmm. I like compilers, and I&#x27;ve got an exam tomorrow, and I know I should study, but let&#x27;s just play one more round of Unreal Tournament (and I know I&#x27;m BSing myself that it&#x27;s just one more round, but F-it).<p>When I first started ADHD meds (Dexedrine + Wellbutrin) it was like that experience where you suddenly realize that the room has gone quiet, but you don&#x27;t recall precisely when. Normally, I&#x27;d have a ghostly music video running in my head just below the level of consciousness. Thoughts darting, snippets of music, visuals. All that was just gone and I was just there. Kind of like a flow state when playing sports. It was very interesting.<p>I eventually developed side effects to the meds, and stopped taking them. In the decade since, I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. I&#x27;m treating that with a CPAP machine, and the results have been incredible. I can still go down research rabbit-holes, but generally have <i>much</i> more control over my executive functions, and I don&#x27;t fall asleep at my desk every afternoon. Note that at the time of the ADHD diagnosis, I had borderline sleep apnea, not severe.<p>So, now I don&#x27;t really consider myself to have ADHD. Aside from any possibly incorrect diagnosis due to sleep apnea, I feel that it&#x27;s important to go beyond labels.<p>Identifying with a label is the first stage. Ok, now you&#x27;ve got an explanation, and a body of knowledge to help. But, I feel the eventual goal should be to move beyond that label. This is where the ADHD as broken leg analogy breaks down. We can&#x27;t (AFAIK) heal a broken leg only with our minds, but I think we can develop enough skills and life experience to turn &quot;you&#x27;ve got ADHD&quot; into &quot;you&#x27;re creative and slightly impulsive&quot;.<p>EDIT> One strange attentional trait that I&#x27;ve still got is that I hear <i>everything</i>. Like, I thought I had super-human hearing for a while. It&#x27;s not, but it makes open-concept offices extremely annoying. Co-workers are constantly surprised that I can hear their conversations from 40 feet away.",1402608040

Eg the slides mention SHA3 as a future option, now it is finalized and afaik usable.</i><p>Not much has changed.  I still think SHA3 is worth considering 5-10 years into the future; five years ago I was concerned about the implications of MD5 and SHA1 breaks on SHA2, but the lack of recent progress makes me happier with staying on SHA2 while SHA3 gets more analysis.<p><i>do you think it would be reasonable to add exception for &quot;DON’T: Try to use a hash function as a symmetric signature.&quot; rule?</i><p>I mentioned this in the talk; even with SHA3 you need to be careful, since a simple &quot;append and hash&quot; would result in MAC(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;data&quot;) == MAC(&quot;keyd&quot;, &quot;ata&quot;), which breaks the MAC assumptions.  Yes, you can use SHA3 as a MAC, but make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p><i>ECC seems to be on the rise (or is it just my perception?).

That said, as mathematicians continue to attack ECC systems, I am gradually becoming more comfortable; the 2025 version of this talk might recommend using them, but for now I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to change my recommendation (except for situations like bitcoin which specifically need ECC&#x27;s advantages).",1402607573

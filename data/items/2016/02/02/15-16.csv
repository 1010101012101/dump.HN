Like I said, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of these rakings, and using them to the digit (4th place vs 6th place) is genuinely absurd.  But overall, you&#x27;ll see here that large public research universities, none of which crack the top 20 for US News undergraduate college rankings, are much more prominent where it comes to engineering.<p>There are reasons in the methodology for this as well - I <i>think</i> that the algorithm used to create the general rankings isn&#x27;t similar to this one, which (like the ranking for grad programs) is more academic and research focused (not considering average SAT, admission rates, funding, and so forth).<p>But overall, the Ivies actually aren&#x27;t highly notable where it comes to computer science and engineering.  Large public research universities, as well as elite non-ivy privates, tend to predominate here.<p>This does make a certain amount of sense.  If a STEM major is an &quot;equalizer&quot;, where smart people who went to less prestigious schools can compete on (more) equal footing, it would make sense that students at highly selective undergraduate programs might eschew engineering or CS in favor of fields where their undergrad school might provide a stronger differentiator.  And, conversely, if a super smart undergrad at San Jose state will have trouble overcoming the pedigree disadvantage in international relations, but can get a more equal crack through engineering, it would make more sense to study STEM.<p>I&#x27;m definitely guilty of some &quot;just-so&quot; reasoning here, but it does fit.",1454428799

If the farm supply is 9.2 miles north of the courthouse, it would be &quot;7360 N Hwy 50&quot;.<p>If your road has curves, you just switch the direction letter between N, S, E, or W.

I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Japanese architect Tadao Ando[0].<p>A lot of brutalist buildings are imposing blocky structures but Ando&#x27;s buildings are poetry in concrete.  The looming mass of negative space in the Chikatsu Asuka Museum[1] is one of the spookiest and most awesome architectural experiences I&#x27;ve had (it&#x27;s dedicated to ancient tombs in the area).  I used to love hanging out at Galleria Akka[2] and I treasure the afternoon I spent at the Church of Light[3].<p>For me a defining feature of Japanese aesthetics is appreciation of the materials from which a thing is made (there&#x27;s a word for it but I&#x27;ve forgotten).  A wooden spoon should not hide the fact that is made of wood.  A clay tea bowl should celebrate its &quot;clay-ness&quot; rather than try to cover itself with glazing, unless the point is to celebrate the materiality of the glaze.  (This aesthetic is the exact opposite of skuemorphism.)  Ando applied this concept to concrete.  In some of his buildings the concrete is rough and you can see the stones embedded in it; in other buildings it is smooth as glass.<p>All that said, I&#x27;ve heard from architects and occupants that his buildings leak like sieves.  They&#x27;re mostly not practical buildings.  They&#x27;re intended to make a visual statement.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Prefectural_Chikatsu_Asuka_Museum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Prefectural_Chikatsu_Asu...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Galleria_%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%8B%EF%BD%8B%EF%BD%81.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Galleria_%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Light"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Light</a><p>Update: edited for formatting (why can&#x27;t HN just use Markdown or RestructuredText??)",1454428615

Metaphorically, it&#x27;s been like opening a window for someone who&#x27;s been stuck in a basement. Even without extreme euphoria—just a simple sense of contentment, like nothing is very wrong—that&#x27;s such a revelation.<p>A big part of depression seems to be this incapacity to even imagine any kind of robust, non-fake happiness. In bad moments one can even get paranoid: like, why is everyone going around <i>pretending</i> like they&#x27;re happy, when they obviously cannot be? I think it&#x27;s like this with any persistent mood; your whole world view is altered.<p>So however you find it, just a couple of hours of, say, having a conversation where you don&#x27;t feel like the worst loser in the universe and the nadir of civilization, that just shows you something about life.<p>&quot;Oh... I... I am just a person like these other people... I don&#x27;t have to radiate horror and disgust... I can just stretch my arms right now and feel my body as an animal with the right to live and enjoy... Huh... Hah! Hahaha!&quot;<p>And then the next morning maybe you feel like crap again, sure. But the understanding that these are just different mind states is so valuable. Like, for someone who really doesn&#x27;t believe in anything except depression anymore, I totally understand suicide.

Under those conditions, it is practically imposible to &quot;go back&quot; after having disrupted the status quo.<p>On the one hand, there is such thing as supply destruction, oil producers that are marginally profitable and that go out of business if price collapses, taking tons of hard capital (not financial, but equipment, personnel know how, etc). The Saudis are pressumably aware of this and very much doing it on purpose.<p>The problem is that there also exist demand destruction. Companies that consume energy in large quantities to produce economically useful but expensive goods and services. This guys conversely go out of business when oil price spikes (there was some statistic going around in 2008 about how 5 out of the last 6 recesions in the US where correlated with high energy prices), which is the intended effect of Saudi strategy.<p>So, eventually, when the noise signal introduced in oil prices gets absorbed by the market negative feedback loops, the economy we go back to will likely be smaller than the economy we started with. We could debate wether this is a good thing or a bad thing, but many actors are nervous because this is a game of musical chairs, and very few can say they will have a guarrantied place at the table by the time the rubble stops bouncing.",1454427776

And therefore forcing people to treat everything as a &quot;file&quot;, which they have certain natural expectations for, leads to problems such as the one here when the objects cannot fulfill the users&#x27; expectations?<p>&quot;Everything is file&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that everything is associated with a block on disk. Filesystems are a very good (and intuitive) way of describing hierarchies, and benefit from requiring literally only one syscall interface that works will all of your tools and programming languages without needing to update the stdlib. How would you propose to represent hierarchies using syscalls? Would you have a &quot;set_uefi_variable&quot; syscall? How would that not become unweidly? ioctls wouldn&#x27;t work (not just because they&#x27;re ioctls but also because you&#x27;d need to open a file, and devices aren&#x27;t files either -- because &quot;everything is a file&quot; is bad, right?). You could try doing it all with kdbus (or something), and that might even be somewhat plausible.

The whole point of Unix is to solve problems quickly, not to have to break out your C compiler each time you want to do something less trivial than renaming a file.<p>> I mean, yeah, those who feel like cowboys might find your system intuitive, but do you not see how it might not be very usable by (or useful to) other people?<p>Filesystems are intuitive to almost all users. When teaching Unix to my friends, I start by saying &quot;everything is a file&quot; and move on from there. Why? Because it&#x27;s actually a useful abstraction. Filesystems are already incredibly intuitive. Not to mention that nobody was actually complaining about how intuitive it is to have efivarfs, it&#x27;s a non-issue.",1454427617

Last year, she was playing with a basketball in our driveway and it slipped out of her hands and into the street.  Mom and I were on the porch when we saw her go after a basketball, we got up running and were screaming at her.  She didn&#x27;t notice us or the car as she emerged from behind a parked car into the street chasing her ball.  The driver ran over the ball and narrowly missed hitting her (also narrowly missed the neighbor&#x27;s big brick mailbox as he swerved).  He didn&#x27;t slow down, just swerved and continued on at a breakneck speed.  The kids are no longer allowed to play in the front yard.<p>Now, sometimes residential roads are indistinguishable from main roads -- lane markers and such can make it easy to speed &quot;by accident&quot;.  This is not the case in my subdivision.  We have a large marquee indicating the name of the subdivision <i>and</i> a posted speed limit (25 MPH) sign.  It&#x27;s all houses, tightly packed, except for an elementary school.  Because of a light with poor timing that causes a back-up on the main road, our subdivision is used as a bypass during Rush Hour.<p>I set up an RPi connected camera to help me make the case for increased enforcement after my daughter was nearly hit by a speeding driver.  Two-thirds of the cars appear to be going well over 25 MPH and over half are going so fast it&#x27;s <i>obvious</i> they&#x27;re going 15 MPH over the speed limit.<p>I <i>doubt</i> anyone is in such a hurry that they&#x27;re <i>consciously</i> choosing the safety of residents of my neighborhood over their 1/2-minute reduction in travel time to their destination, but their actions are just that.  I&#x27;ll be adding this feature to the software I use to track traffic in my neighborhood.  I might even go so far as to shame the worst of the drivers (mostly 16-17 year-olds).  I even toyed with the idea of setting up a sign that lights up a &quot;Slow Down&quot; message when a car is obviously speeding, but I&#x27;m betting that&#x27;d run afoul of local ordinances.  Incidentally, I had tried to get a &quot;Deaf Child/Disabled Child&quot; sign put up, but I was told the township no longer does this and given the dubious excuse that &quot;they provide a false sense of security&quot; (no -- &quot;they&#x27;re expensive&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re tired of having to change them when the wording is decided to be &#x27;politically-incorrect&#x27; every few months&quot; is the problem -- they still put up &quot;Pedestrian Crossing&quot; and other related signs and they still maintain the existing ones when they get knocked over).",1454427567

They&#x27;ve been camped-out on someone else&#x27;s land ( marked for housing development ), and the owner of the hovercraft hasn&#x27;t been paying rent, and the Museum hasn&#x27;t contributed to the rent either despite using the SR.N4s as their central attraction.  Hence they have now been taken as payment for back-rent.  Fair dues.<p>Therefore I don&#x27;t particularly feel that the Hovercraft Museum is the best trustee for the future but they&#x27;ve left everything to the last minute and positioned themselves as the <i>de facto</i> saviours.<p>Headlines and petitions never tell the full story.",1454427420

Over recent years petro companies have invested in getting at fuels based on high prices - deep drilling, fracking, tar sands, all are really expensive.

According to time.com, &quot;a 22% increase in injuries from rear-end accidents.&quot;<p>So yes, you can expect more rear end collisions and injuries when traffic light enforcement automation breaks up traditional driving habits.<p>Arguably, its okay to speed. Say doing 50 in a 40 when there&#x27;s no traffic, like late at night. Why do we need a system to enforce this? I wish there was more fuzzy logic applied to traffic systems. Say a peak hours vs non-peak hours speed limit. Longer yellows during rush hour when everyone is stressed and potentially distracted.

It&#x27;s my opinoin that this issue is underdiscussed and that the mess that is often delivered is rationalized by &quot;methodology&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s not our fault our requirements force us to deliver this&quot;.<p>But whatever the reason or rational, every time a story breaks about another security exploit or privacy exploit I read that as a condemnation on our profession.<p>In other professions, part of the certification process is gaining a basic level of understanding of the ethics one is judged against when associating one&#x27;s work with that of the larger trades group, guild, or association. Often it is well understood that, to some extent, the topic is simply being paid lip service. But,it is also understood that those ethics draw a bright line which those the association serves will not tolerate when openly crossed. Take for instance investment professionals. Everyone knows insider trading happens and it&#x27;s not uncommon to put profit before fiduciary duty, but when those lines are openly or egregiously crossed it is not tolerated under threat that the understanding between the client and advisor that minor infractions will be tolerated will no longer be honored.<p>The software engineering profession lacks this basic ethical covenant with its customer. Just look at the utter lack of product warranties. Sure there are SLAs, but there are virtually no warranties. And it shows.<p>As software begins to function more and more as the linchpin of our society, this issue will morph from technical debt to an Achilles heel. We complain about anachronistic laws. What about anachronistic code? We complain about absurd laws. What about absurd code? It&#x27;s just as dangerous.",1454426090

It has no homes facing the road, just a few fenced backyards some fair distance away but mostly it has farms, ponds, and golf courses. People regularly go 40-50 MPH down this road.<p>Another major road that crosses this one has a speed limit of 55 MPH. It has several houses directly on it. I&#x27;ve stopped once to let an old man cross the street to get to his mail box. It has a school (where the speed limit drops to 45 MPH). It is too narrow and dark in my opinion to have a 55 MPH speed limit.<p>I believe both roads should be 45 MPH.<p>Furthermore, the freeways through town are 55 MPH speed limit. Ridiculous. Most states have 65 MPH limits even within a city. (I didn&#x27;t grow up here, obviously.) So naturally there is a lot of speeding.<p>There are probably several rules and reasons for these limits. The 35 MPH road is within city limits while the 55 MPH road is technically in a different township and would once have been considered a farm/country road though it is now a major road to an office building complex and school. We also have to deal with snow and other weather conditions part of the year, and we don&#x27;t have electronic speed limit signs to change the speed limit or something based on changing conditions.<p>Then there&#x27;s also the fact that city planners never manage to build sufficient roads until the current ones are overcrowded. So this 35 MPH road probably was not originally intended to be such a major road, but there isn&#x27;t any other good way to go N-S through that part of town because the rest is all winding back and forth through neighborhoods.<p>I would definitely be in favor of having speed limits that were consistent and actually made sense, then enforcing them very carefully.<p>(Note that the article doesn&#x27;t say how much over 25 counted as speeding. Did he count 26 as speeding? My own metric is that if it is less than 5 over then it is not speeding.)",1454426003

Many decisions may have been individually right, but it sets off a domino effect of upgrades and disruptions to your workflow.<p>I agree with you that if you bothered to read the iOS release notes, it should have warned you that it will require an OS X upgrade. But again the larger lesson is not to get your software into such a fragile state where one update causes a domino effect.<p>My solution is to always say yes when I&#x27;m prompted for an upgrade. That way, a single upgrade causes little trouble. When I use a product or service, I&#x27;m buying into the developer&#x27;s vision, not making a decision as to whether to use version 3.5.638 of an app. And if that developer&#x27;s vision no longer works for me, I switch to another developer, rather than micromanaging every version of every app.<p>And if an app doesn&#x27;t work with an updated OS, that&#x27;s the app developer&#x27;s fault as far as I&#x27;m concerned.

Point by point:<p>>  Cancellation is then implicit on deallocation<p>In practice, you&#x27;re going to have retain cycles, no?  I mean I don&#x27;t know where these four lines &quot;live&quot;, but if we write them in a closure and ship them off to a sync/diff/runloop engine, unless we are quite careful, that sync engine is going to hold a great many strong references.  Unless you intend this to be an IBAction definition, in which case...<p>> because it provides type safety and compiler verification, instead of hoping that your target/selectors and KVO work and never break when you edit something and the compiler doesn&#x27;t complain.<p>As long as the underlying Cocoa uses target-action, true compiler verification is impossible.  Compiler verification checks <i>something</i> (these four lines) but it doesn&#x27;t check that these lines actually run when the slider is moved in any way.<p>> FRP-like systems allow you to take some evil imperative state (a slider was moved!), lift it into a happy pure-functional world,<p>It&#x27;s not immediately clear to me how e.g. throttle is implemented, but it must accumulate state inside it somehow in order to replay the event after the timer.<p>> Complex UIs are exactly where you want this type of system, because it provides type safety and compiler verification, instead of hoping that your target/selectors and KVO work and never break when you edit something and the compiler doesn&#x27;t complain.<p>Compiler verification is good; tests are better.  And I do not understand how you would even begin to write unit tests for this.<p>Now we get to:<p>1.  Stopping in the debugger and trying to reason about these signal chains is complicated, because what we have here is a datastructure in memory, not lines of code I can step through<p>2.  This example does not account for threading, and in any nontrivial example you want to move between background and foreground a few times.  It also does not deal with &quot;splitting/merging&quot; (multiple observers, etc.) and I suspect the intersection of those two features is a sharp edge.<p>3.  Finally, let&#x27;s compare against a slightly more traditional syntax:<p><pre><code>    @IBAction func valueChanged() {\n        dispatch_throttle(0.5, onQueue: dispatch_get_main_queue()) {\n            colorView.color = colorToValue(red: sliderA.value, green: sliderB.value, blue: sliderC.value)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis syntax is also four lines of code, including the context of where the lines live.  This example resolves all the problems I listed with the FRP example.  In addition, it also collates which slider goes with which color component in a single line, rather than breaking that relationship apart across a (potentially long) signal path.<p>To evolve from your first example to your second example we would just change<p><pre><code>    slider.addTarget(self, action: &quot;valueChanged&quot;, forControlEvents: .ValueChanged)\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>    button.addTarget(self, action: &quot;valueChanged&quot;, forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)\n</code></pre>\nWhile I readily concede this aspect is not quite as elegant as your example, to me having a slightly more complicated 1-line diff is a very low price to pay for all the other benefits I listed.",1454425866

They are considering requiring that those publishing clinical trial reports must also share the underlying data.<p>The ICMJE says that authors should have the ability to prevent release of the data for six months after publication. This will prevent researchers from performing independent analyses of a study, until well after its conclusions have been trumpeted in the press. Also, while many papers currently promise data or other materials are &quot;available on request,&quot; anyone who has tried to actually get these data knows that this is often just wishful thinking. Only by requiring data availability in an independent repository at publication can journal editors and reviewers ensure that it will be available to other researchers and the public.<p>The ICMJE is accepting comments on this proposal through April 18:<p><a href=""https://forms.acponline.org/webform/comments-icmje%E2%80%99s-proposals-sharing-clinical-trial-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forms.acponline.org/webform/comments-icmje%E2%80%99s...</a><p>If you are a patient or a researcher, please comment.",1454425227

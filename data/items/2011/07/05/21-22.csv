2731722,comment,2728706,2731439,1,0,jbert,,,"> That doesn't help: the objects in the DOM are already allocated on the heap. You just want to hold on to them and then drop those references at some point.<p>The idea is to have more than one heap, with different behaviour. Objects in one heap have a ""can disappear at any time, but we can detect that"" behaviour.<p>An 'object deep copy' is all it takes to move an object from one heap to another. Or if you prefer, you can allocate all such objects in the discardable heap but temporarily 'pin' an object by changing the madvise on it's pages (this involves more page-level complexity of how stuff is laid out and how pages are shared between objects).<p>I'm not saying this is a 2 hour project, but it's the sort of thing which could be captured in a library without too much complexity.<p>> Writing a pointer to a heap object to disk, even via mmaped memory areas, isn't going to really work well.<p>You'd be surprised. I've done exactly this [1]. As long as your mmap'd addresses are stable, it's fine. Also note that in the case we're talking about,the pages <i>never go to disk</i>. They're in anonymous-backed mmap'd memory, which the kernel has been told to throw away instead of writing to disk (swap in this case, since this is an anon map).<p>[1] well, pretty close. I made a single-proc app multi-proc by making it's key data structures allocate out of a pool controlled by a custom malloc, backed by a mmap()'d disk file. Other processes then <i>attached</i> to that file via mmap() <i>at the same address</i> and lo and behold, all the pointers to the nested data structures were good. (One proc had read/write access to this pool, the others were all readonly. Some additional locking was required. Your mileage may vary.)<p>You're right in that things won't work if something else has a ptr to these pages. But as long as all references to such pages go via a single ""get_page_from_cache()"" it's fine.",1309902305

2731716,comment,2730286,2730286,14,0,iam,,,"I think this is a problem that exists across any VM that implements a GC, not just Ruby.<p>.NET CLR has the exact same problem (perhaps a harder one, since CLR has a moving GC), so anytime they touch GC references (pointers to objects that are collectible) it's always wrapped in an explicit GC stack frame (think GC struct that lives on the stack). Furthermore, all reads/writes are carefully done with macros (which of course expands to volatile + some other stuff) to make sure the compiler doesn't optimize it away.<p>On the one hand, this is nice because they don't need to scan the C-stack (it scans the VM stack and the fake GC frame stacks -- well it's one stack but you skip the native C frames), on the other hand this means that any time a GC object is used in C code (ok, actually it's C++) they have to be real careful to guard it.<p>Of course bugs crop up all the time where an object gets collected where it shouldn't have, it happens so often that there is a name for it -- ""GC Hole"".<p>Astute readers and users of p/invoke may remark that they don't have to set up any ""GC frames"" -- that is because this complicated scheme is not exposed outside of the CLR source. Regular users of .NET who want to marshal pointers between native/managed can simply request that a GC reference gets pinned, at which point I'm mostly sure it won't get collected until it's unpinned.<p>The bad news is I'm almost positive there is nothing you can do with just C here to make this problem go away. You'd want stuff to magically just happen under the hood, and C++ is the right way to go for that.<p>It's probably possible to create an RAII style C++ GC smart pointer that would be 99% foolproof at the expense of some performance. It gets a little bit trickier if we are doing a moving collector. I am thinking it could ref/unref at creation/destruction, and disallow any direct raw pointer usage not to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>Of course the people writing the GC still need to worry about this..",1309902149

I could just as easily define a circle as the shape which encloses the most area for a given perimeter. If you think this is confusing, consider that it is the same as defining it as the shape which a small water droplet forms on a piece of glass.<p>The thing is that most of us knew what a circle was before we knew what a radius was. You've probably been encountering circles since before you could speak, and the term was certainly in your vocabulary long before you ever took a course in geometry. Appealing to the definition of a circle as elegant is weird when you consider the intrinsic <i>inelegance</i> of trying to formally define an intuitive concept. It makes <i>more</i> sense to measure it, which could be why Archimedes, Liu Hui, and Brahmagupta all ended up studying the same number.<p>Euclid's formalization of geometry was a landmark achievement in mathematics and possibly the most important single technique of antiquity. However, it was superseded multiple times before set theory became the foundation of essentially all of modern mathematics. Today, a circle is not an axiom but a construct itself derived from the distance formula and the definition of R^2 (a collection of points all the same <i>distance</i>...).<p>What got me involved in this argument is the assertion that it would make life easier for students learning mathematics. I, like most HN'ers, regard with serious concern the deterioration of mathematics education in the United States, but, also like most HN'ers, am not apt to solve my problems with snake oil. As a student myself, I regularly got pi/3 confused with pi/6, as the latter was a third of a right angle. Since angles and their respective sines and cosines were always diagrammed in class as portions of a right angle, I slipped up a few times between pi and pi/2.<p>This doesn't mean anything, though, other than a vagary of the way I used to think at the ripe old age of ten. Students of mathematics quite often have their own individual approaches and understandings of the concepts as presented, and this switch of constants is not really likely to make things any easier. This is why I kept pressuring you (unreasonably I do admit) to demonstrate that some essential proof or argument is simplified by using tau.<p>It is <i>more</i> annoying, though, when good, practical, tested, and effective solutions to educational problems go ignored in favor of something that geeks find interesting.<p><a href=""http://jumpmath.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jumpmath.org/</a><p>This is <i>an example of</i> a far more effective use of our collective time than the definition of any fundamental constant, be it pi (perhaps tau/2), e (perhaps 1/d, where d is the decay constant), i (perhaps -i), gamma (perhaps log(gamma-prime), since e^gamma appears as often as gamma), etc...",1309901467

Working a minimum wage job has no connection or relevance to adult life unless you're planning on being poor.  It's economically meaningless compared to the money a kid expects to earn after college, so what matters for a teenager's adult life is to get a leg up on college admissions by working on academics or extracurriculars.<p>Now, that attitude may not be accurate.  Maybe working at McDonald's or some other typical teenage employment provides valuable experience or some skills that will be relevant to their adult life.  However, few if any middle-class parents tell their kids that, because they don't want to encourage them.  For kids to get used to working a minimum wage job -- to get a taste of self-sufficiency too early -- to believe that life is <i>possible</i> without college -- these are not things that ambitious middle-class parents and teachers want for their kids.  They don't want their kids to see life as a highway with exit ramps and rest stops at various points along the way.  They want their kids to see life as a railroad to lucrative professional employment, with any departure from the path resulting in a catastrophic derailment.",1309900854

We've got our own side projects too, and so we think we could really help out and make a difference, as opposed to sitting back and chilling out at a larger company.<p>Unfortunately, every start up (or potential startup) we reach out to has the same idea - ""Oh, just work for equity"" (the landlord doesn't take equity), or they want us only as full-time employees (won't work due to aforementioned side projects).<p>Are we just asking for too much?<p>How do people running startups/small businesses feel about hiring experienced contractors?<p>Would you prefer a  less experienced employee to a more experienced contractor, all else being equal?",1309899769

You have to look at one side of the line in order for the postulate to have any relevance.<p>>Euclid would have been a tau advocate<p>Oh yeah? Well.. well... Ramanujan would have been a pi advocate! Ha!<p>>which is clearly superior to the diameter.<p>It is expedient in the process of mathematical argumentation. Looking at expedience, though, we see that using a constant 2pi introduces an untoward amount of fractions into just about every mathematical calculation -- see for example here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem#A_rigorous_proof_using_Fourier_series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem#A_rigorous_proof_...</a><p>Irrespective of the definition of constants, which is long since forgotten at this point (how much of a pain is it to define a circle, starting from ZFC?), it is kind of disappointing to see you refusing to read the proofs which you claim to be clarifying -- most of them get uglier moving to tau, on a cursory examination of the seminal work <i>Proofs from THE BOOK</i>. Go on, mentally replace every instance of ""2pi"" with ""tau"" and ""pi"" with ""tau/2"" in, say, this paper:<p><a href=""http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Zeta/EZeta.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Zeta/EZe...</a>",1309899609

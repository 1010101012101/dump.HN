67735,comment,67728,67728,0,0,iamwil,,,"The liberal sprinkling of the word ""always"" makes me rather wary.  It's easy to just take it as ""the way to do it"", and don't know why, especially as a programmer like myself.  When things change later on, it's easy to end up being one of those that just do it because you've been told to do it that way.<p>The general spirit of the article is spot on though.  I liked the suggestion to try using line height or spacing to differentiate headings from body, rather than just to bold everything just because that's the browser default.  The idea of alignment points is something I knew implicitly, but never thought about specifically.  I think there's a book called Grid Systems that discusses this.  <p>The idea of web design is to communicate what is important vs what isn't (as an easy over-generalization).  You can use any number of techniques to achieve that.  This is a good start, I think.",1192387624

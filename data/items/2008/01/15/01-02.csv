98452,comment,98227,98403,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Agreed on the obsession with brevity.<p>Reminds me of mathematical proofs, where you work out everything offline, and then make the proof elegantly brief. There is a similar process going on here - writing macros really does boil down to that kind of offline work.<p>Just as with such elegant proofs, though, you do need a pencil and paper to trace through the steps. And if the programmer were anything but of the highest caliber, it is fairly easy to get tripped up.<p>The way blub languages handle (the absence of) macros for td, tr etc. is to invent templating languages (JSP etc) where you embed Java inside HTML. You basically have a DSL living in a separate syntactic space. That gets the job done, for the specific problem space at hand (web apps).<p>I have come to like that syntactic space separation: HTML lives as HTML, SQL lives as SQL and so on. With macros, you are getting everything to live in the same syntactic space, so you get the proliferation of tokens, without that structural separation that aids in comprehension.",1200360599

98450,comment,98227,98323,0,0,jfoutz,,,"This is a little tricky, Types can be pretty broad. First, you could define a tree type with all sorts of different leaves, you could have a list of tree parts, something like:<p>Tree = Branch Tree Tree\n| ILeaf Int\n| SLeaf String<p>then a list like [ILeaf 1, SLeaf ""foo""].\nAnother way to go takes advantage of type erasure. Currently it's just a popular extension but it lets you have lists of stuff in the same type class.<p>A good example is ""Show"" you can have a list off stuff that knows how to turn itself into strings. always a handy thing.<p>Basically you get the big two, group things based on what they are, or group things based on what you can do to them.<p>Perhaps there is a big pile of random stuff you want to hang on to, but i'd bet 99.9% of the time you really want to collect the stuff into a coherent type.",1200360494

98447,comment,98244,98325,0,0,aswanson,,,"I agree with the sentiment.  A lot of this stuff seems to be retrofitted to the observation.  You can explain a lot of things through evolution, but to explain all behaviour in terms of it leads to a lot quackery and pseudoscience.<p>There doesn't seem to be a lot of rigor in these types of papers; a lot of hand waving.",1200360106
98446,comment,98149,98149,0,0,ltbarcly,,,"A combination should work well enough.<p>1. Obviously allow password resets to on file email addresses.<p>2. If the above fails, try geocoding the address with google or geocode.us.  If it successfully geocodes, ask the user for the address used to signup for the account, and tell them the zipcode the address was in so they know what address if they moved.  Take the address they give you and geocode that.  If they are very very close in lat-lon it is the same address (you might call this a geo-hash of the address).<p>3. No email and fake address?  Well, this is a consequence of lying when they signed up, so you might say TFB and let them start a new account.<p>I can't give you more alternatives without knowing what other info you have on them, but the first two here should cover 90% of your users who didn't lie about their address based on the statistics that I pulled from my butt.",1200359917

The article in question, though, was suggesting that people are choosing wrong when they knowingly choose to be poorer but happier.  There was no failure to understand the problem implied -- it's just that they didn't choose the way the article author wanted them to, and he conveyed this by calling them irrational.",1200359171

98440,comment,98361,98431,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Just googling around, doesn't seem to be a real number. For instance, the 4th google hit for ""ruby on rails contract"" says ""This is a 2 month contract position paying $40/hour""<p>I know I just got through paying some RoR guys about twice that for some code monkey stuff. So the 40-80 range looks a lot more real than 200. Note that I'm not saying there isn't somebody out there making 200/hour, just it is not indicative of where the market is at. Heck, there's probably a few 200/hour COBOL programmers out there too, but that's not saying much for the idea of being a COBOL programmer. It's just an outlier.",1200358873

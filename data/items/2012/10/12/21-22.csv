4647041,comment,4645523,4645523,2,0,caycep,,,"I work with DBS.<p>It's primarily used for motor disorders like Parkinson's disease and dystonia.  It works fantastically well.  Patients move better and take less meds.<p>It's not some fancy brain programming - you can modify the signal somewhat, but the current tech is essentially a hot-rigged Medtronic heart pacemaker that is wired to the brain instead.   You set it at around 0.5 - 3.5 V (I think depression they often crank it up to 5-6 V, for no better reason than just because...), around 60-120 microsecond pulse duration, and between 60-180 Hz.    So no, not in-depth brain programming yet.<p>For depression- it's much harder to know because the scales are much more subjective.   For PD, dystonia - easy - measure if they are moving or not.   For depression, you need a complex scale that tries to quantify ""how do you feel""?   Plus, it's open label and non blinded, so yes, they are going to say, ""I feel better"" after they've underwent surgery like that.<p>For those of you who are interested in DBS for depression, pubmed the papers by Helen Mayberg of Emory and Andres Lozano of the University of Toronto.   It's promising, but still far from ready for prime time - studies are open label and too preliminary.<p>Ironic that the major quotes are from the division head of Medtronic, who, although he's a really smart and a really nice guy, is an executive of the company that stand to receive financial gain.   Not that they shouldn't quote him, but they should have contacted the researchers who did the studies first.<p>Other issues:   I think transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS/rTMS is much more widely used that tDCS, on the account of tDCS limits how much energy you can zap without causing pain.    There is one device that is approved for TMS in depression- the problem is that the effects don't last too much longer after you shut the machine off.  (DBS stays on 24/7).   What's scandalous about that device is, there's some sort of disposable widget that costs >$100 a pop and is one use only.   Nice cash flow for the devive manufacturer built into the design...",1350079134

Identifying obstacles is a necessary first step in the process of determining whether or not you can overcome them.<p>The second step would be analysis. It's pointless to identify obstacles just so you can assume that you'll overcome them all.  Not all obstacles are created equal. You need to take the time to look at the more major ones in detail, so you can create a strategy, and then assess that strategy. The end result is more accurate assumptions.<p>Of course your best-laid plans may go to waste, and your best-made predictions may prove inaccurate.

When you eat, observe and only eat. Taste the food and only eat.  So on and so forth.  I believe this is the best DIY of meditation, though not everyone agrees that being mindfulness is meditation, but I tend to think that it IS meditation and not necessarily mindfulness, because the goal of being in here-now is to eliminate the distraction of past/future and not really to concentrate.

It's a very low-level system, with lots of related system calls, ioctls etc., requiring the user to do all the error checking, setup and boilerplate. All error-prone, too many L3 addresses passed around and altogether a mixture of several decades of network programming.<p>Assuming that's all really necessary on the lower levels (don't want to get into that, not my area of expertise), it's still not something a common systems programmer should face. You might know about the details, just like you know about TCP/IP packets, network layers etc, but more 80+ percent of your day job you shouldn't need to care about that. It's like constructing output piece by piece, with print_number(12); print_string("" / 2 = ""); print_number(12/2); print_newline(); etc.\nNobody but the most ardent DJB fans would want to do that. But for sockets it's basically expected. Network programming would've needed a printf-style interface from the early days, now it's too late to wrap the basic, the proliferation of incompatible high-perf syscalls didn't help.<p>I don't want to appear like one of those smug Plan 9 purists, but they did something right. Apart from treating network communication and file systems the same way, they also had some nice wrappers for the lower level stuff, e.g. <a href=""http://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man3/dial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man3/dial.html</a><p>But yes, I'm mainly joking about ""bad karma"".

Slowly ever so slowly, some bliss starts to bubble up from within. It is the climax of one pointed attention. Few people who say they ""meditate"" are reaching that point since it requires years of sincere effort. In Yoga, meditation is known as Dhyana, or the state resulting from the mind becoming one pointed for 100 seconds. Samadhi, which is considered a state of deep bliss is considered reached when the mind becomes completely still for 1000 seconds.<p>Mindfullness, is the act of being more aware during daily activities. Like watching actions and interactions. There is a gradual tendency to modify behavior to being more calm, collected and centered which helps to go deeper when attempting to meditate. The mind is still active during mindfullness, but it is being directed or corrected as needed throughout the day.<p>Meditation helps to develop deeper Mindfullness and vice versa. Meditation is like taking a shower, whereas Mindfullness is avoiding rolling in the mud and getting dirty. It is important to keep in mind that Meditation is literally a state where the mind is free from thought and that all the ""meditation practices and techniques"" are just different paths of reaching that same place.",1350075949

And with html5/css3/js/webgl and the newest generation of standards, we almost found it.<p>We did used to download random binaries from the internet and run them. It took too much effort to get up and running and there were compatibility issues between systems, not to mention dependencies (java / c++ runtimes etc.), dll hell, having to support myriad different OSes and OS versions. When it broke, it broke badly and usually you had 0 chances of debugging, save sending a core dump back over the internet, if the user let you.<p>Meanwhile, standards came and improved, and finally we realized that we already had a UI toolkit that ran reasonably across all platforms, didn't require any dependency installations, ran ""programs"" instantly without any download and installation procedure. This alone is as large a marketing win as it is a tech win. Remind you of something? It's the web we know and love today. And you get logs when it breaks. And you can watch your users using it, page by page and get stats. And the limited nature of the abstraction layer means that if it breaks, it doesn't fail as catastrophically, there is less chance of a big fat ugly core dump message, there is more of a chance you almost instantly know. And the hard abstraction layer means that there is a clearer understanding of security implications. Web apps, generally speaking, can't access my files. Can Java applets or ActiveX components? A bit more hazy. Can executables? Yeah. Can this proposed system? Maybe?<p>The modern web (browser and standards together) <i>is</i> a universal VM and an SDK rolled into one. It's the only one we have that works reasonably well enough and strikes a decent balance between capability and ease of development.<p>The point of this person's system, which is the proposed freedom from browser restrictions and incompatibilities, is a complete fallacy. Is Microsoft going to recreate this new system for every system under the sun? No. People (and companies like Apple, Google) will have to create their own, and thus incompatibilities will prevail.

In addition to rather unwisely terminating the study early, they were also careful to use sterile surgical instruments, made sure to inform the participants that they'd still need to use condoms and give them a supply of condoms and education on how to use them, and ensured that the newly-circumcised individuals refrained from sex whilst their wounds healed.

Men are being circumcised with bloody instruments, under the belief that this means they don't have to use condoms anymore, and any funding that's going towards circumcision is funding that's not being used to supply condoms and condom education. The difference between what's actually happening and what can ethically be studied is huge and most likely fatal. I suspect the whole thing's going to end up turning out to be another ill-conceived Western intervention that sows distrust a few years down the line.",1350075729

So it's practice for resisting your urges, which makes you better at resisting your urges when it actually matters (like while working). Why not just practice resisting your urges while working and avoid the extra time required for dedicated meditation?",1350075709

As we practice this over time the mind will more easily quiet down. Be the patient observer of your mind and know that you are not your thoughts.<p>I highly recommend some of Jon Kabat-Zinns books, and/or some of his videos on YouTube. These have been very helpful to me.",1350075670

The former is very important, for just the reasons you state.  The latter effectively ensures that we will <i>not</i> overcome said obstacles, because we won't have effective plans to do so.",1350075632

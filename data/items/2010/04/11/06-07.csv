1256490,comment,1255718,1255796,0,0,babycakes,,,"> Who wants to go to the suburbs!?<p>People who like space between them and their sociopathic neighbors?<p>I had a passive-aggressive downstairs neighbor who would never tell me if I was disturbing her; she went straight to the apartment office every time.  When I tried to ask what was disturbing her, she wouldn't answer the door.  For the life of me, I never figured out what she was complaining about.  I played my guitar amp with headphones and never turned the TV beyond a reasonable volume, but nobody ever listens to the person who is accused of being loud, especially when the person complaining is a single mom with baby in tow.  After suffering the tyranny of my downstairs neighbor and threats of fines or eviction for noise violations, I decided to move into a house in west San Jose.<p>I've lived in large cities and generally enjoyed the convenience, but that apartment was my last.  Here, I don't need to wear headphones to play my guitar.  I can actually use my stereo speakers when watching movies.  When friends come over to play board games on a Saturday afternoon, I don't have to quiet them down when something exciting happens.  I can barbecue in my back yard during the summer, and if I feel like hanging picture frames at 2:30 AM, nobody else cares.<p>The suburbs obviously aren't for everybody, but they work for me.",1270968919

It saves a ton of time, and the engine is very efficient and well developed and probably would do a better job than you whipping something yourself with just OpenGL ES.  (Not to mention you don't have to learn OpenGL). The main chunk of the engine is written in C/C++ with other C libraries, but developers don't see that part and instead interface with the engine through a C#/javascript with types/Boo scripting interface and a 3D modeling interface to build objects and assets.  I used it to make a game that didn't go through and I know using anything else would taken many months more of my time. If I was one of the developers who made one of those top listing games, I'd be pretty worried now about the future of my business.<p>Also not to mention, almost every type of game engine/game development methodology use a very similar model of main engine in c/game logic in a scripting language, and to not to be able to do that significantly decreases productivity.

The new dev agreement makes it much more explicit/clear.\nIf I wanted to develop Android apps, I wouldn’t expect to use Cocoa-Touch and Objective-C. Similarly, I don’t need .NET or Flash to write iPhone apps. I like the Apple platform and code to it.<p>It appears that Apple wants to limit their app-store to developers who want to work with their platform. I think this is a legitimate desire. From Apple’s perspective, it helps iPhone users by improving quality and reducing quantity in the app-store and it also helps developers who invested the time to learn Apple’s platform. Obviously, it also helps Apple if developers use their platform directly instead of going through middle-men. Overall, I don’t have a problem with Apple’s policy.",1270967693

Apple should get praise for addressing this thing before it blew up, not ""after numerous warnings were ignored"". We don't want scared users, we want users happy and safe.<p>I also like the ban on 3d-party analytics for purely selfish reasons - I have my own and this ban gives me an advantage. It also paves the way for me to sell my analytics package to people to use in-house later on. Apple has shown indifference to dev analytics (beyond daily sales numbers) so I hope they keep doing that.<p>I like the cross-language compiler ban as well, again for selfish reasons. I was not looking forward to a horde of flash developers joining the fray and flooding the app store with more apps.

When you <i>are</i> allocating stuff on the heap, manually using malloc() can be very inefficient. Not to mention recent versions of the JVM can perform escape analysis and convert un-needed heap allocation to stack allocation.<p>From my own experiences, bigger problems occur with extra large heaps (>32gb). That's where the dreaded Java GC pauses and CMS failures come in. In these cases custom memory allocators (such as memcached's) are what people turn to.<p>I'd also wager the iPhone/iPad are not low-memory devices by any stretch of the imagination. The amount of memory is orders of magnitude higher than the original machines on which Smalltalk, Common Lisp and Java were developed. Erlang (with the BEAM VM) is meant to run extremely reliable on very limited telecommunications switch equipment.<p>That being said, well written, profiled and optimized code in C is always going to beat code written in a JIT-compiled, garbage collected language. 3d graphics and gaming is one such place and I'd hesitate using anything other than C for these domains (at least for now).",1270966355

So if you're producing decent stuff (or better, of course), you'll be in high demand.  I'm not sure for how long you'll be in high demand, but I think this is a great move from Apple for ObjC-developers. It makes them in even higher demand. Anybody can program in Flash or Java, but learning ObjC is a bit different and perceived as more difficult, due to things like no automatic garbage collection and (sometimes) low-level C APIs.  All those developers that have invested their time in learning these things are now rewarded by Apple.<p>I used to be an iPhone developer, and although it's really good for making money, I was personally frustrated by Obj-C.  It's not that I can't program in it: I've been making good money from it for over a year.  It's just that I also program in Haskell, and that is just such a better fit for me.  I guess it's really a personal thing.  I've decided to quit before I grew really frustrated, and start doing things I love.

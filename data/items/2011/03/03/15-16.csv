The drug is the same, but your resistance has built up.<p>In the beginning, many people come to HN and are overwheled to find a community of people JUST LIKE THEM.  They thought this never could exist so elegantly, and the initial reaction is euphoria.  Then over time you realize that cycles start to repeat, there can only be so much ""new"" news, and so on.  The drug has stayed the same, but you have a resistance to it now.  A startup that someone launched over the weekend that is featured on TC Monday afternoon isn't as significant to you as it was the first 3 times you watched it happen.  An essay from PG? Still inspiring, but after you've read 20 of them the additive effects of each additional essay are a little less than the one before it.<p>HN is the same as it ever was.  There exists an opportunity still to build something even better though.  Doing is more rewarded than observing here, especially when the observation is not new or insightful.  This is why some of the reactions to your post may seem a little bit harsh.<p>If you want HN to go back to the way it was, build that.

I bought a 32gb and wish I had saved the 100 bucks. All my content is on my Mac which has many hundreds of GB of storage.<p>Well yeah but not everybody's is, and iPad would be even better if <i>there never was a need to tether it to anything</i> (but a wall outlet for charging).<p>This is not the case currently.<p>On the other hand, storage space — as screen resolution — is a technical problem: you can't find 128GB NAND chips on the market, not in the amount Apple needs anyway. That's also why the iPod Touch still has only 64GB NAND and the iPhone finds itself lagging at 32.",1299166177

I think I would thrive in a tutoring type of atmosphere. I would love to find someone to teach me, but don't know if that's the best route. I have no hesitation from going to a tech college or community college to learn enough so I can start learning on my own.<p>If you were to start over, what would you recommend? Get over myself and hit the books? Try and find a small classroom environment hoping they teach what I want to learn (again, Ruby for web dev and Objective C for Mac/iPhone dev)?

I envision the ""hardness level"" of a code base to be about the same throughout one iteration/release.  This gives time for the production application to generate runtime profile data from actual use.  In this case, the more data, the better.  This data can then be massaged and verified by programmers using suitable tools and their in-depth knowledge of the application.  (So runtime traces which contradict each other's type inferences can be looked at, etc.)  Such tools can also apply a set of massaged type annotations to a branch of the code base, which can then be tested and merged back into the main branch of the application.  I think this is a very natural pace of this level of change for most shops.  This technique can also be adapted to apply to specific sections of code which need to be optimized, or can be applied incrementally across a code base over time.",1299166135

It's all about the information, and who controls it.</i><p>For these services, Google can't be dislodged because another entity can't come in and grab the code that harvests that information. But I don't think that's the case for Android; someone could rewrite the code so that Google doesn't get this information.<p>In reading some comments, I get the feeling that people think we are debating the technical merits of Android. The question really is: How much does Google make/lose because it is developing Android? The fact that your would-be competitors can prevent you from gathering user information (which was the very reason for the creation of this project) doesn't make sense. This is one business strike against developing Android.<p>In this article: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/15/google-android-money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/15/google-android-money/</a> there's an interesting quote:<p>> <i>Schmidt called Android “probably the largest single platform play in the market today.” And going forward, he thinks that’s only going to increase as more and more people buy smartphones. At the same time, “in the open source approach, that means we give the software away, which is always paradoxical. People say, well how do you make money from that?,” Schmidt was quick to jump to. “The evidence we have is that people who use Android search twice as much as everything else,” Schmidt continued. “So, clearly, there is more revenue associated with those searches.”</i><p>But Eric Schmidt is NOT saying that they are making twice as much money off of people who use Android. And there's also no data to measure how much people would be searching if Android didn't exist. Do people who use WebOS search twice as much as everything else? What about people that use iOS? What about people that use Symbian? Etc. If people would have searched twice as everything else on other platforms, then that takes away a lot of the business justification for Android: Google would have gotten their doubled-search without doing anything. This is another business strike.",1299165067

They realized they were missing a big market. It's why the original Fullmetal Alchemist ('03-'04) was a fansub for a long time before an official NA release, while the recent remake came out in English[1] on Hulu days after airing in Japan.<p>A whole new import market sprung up because of what was technically piracy.<p>[1]With subtitles, but dubbed episodes started popping up on the Hulu page near the end of the show's run.",1299164683

Some days we have three stories on the front page about Facebook (the day before yesterday) and I don't think a single day goes by where some Apple story doesn't creep its way in. There's an Apple-related story on the front page right now and two on the second page. It's gotten better over the last year though. It used to be that 3-4 (or more) articles about Apple and Facebook were on the front page at any given time.",1299164534

However, I would argue that open standards were even more critical. Email, DNS, TCP/IP, HTML -- Having a common base on which to build new technologies allowed a huge amount of innovation to occur very rapidly.<p>Imagine the difference if many companies had competing formats for the base technologies. It would be like when railroad companies used different gauges for train tracks. Interoperability would have been a nightmare. Or worse, if a single company invented the tech and demanded royalties -- would the web be what it is if everyone had to pay royalties to use HTML? I believe that the innovations would have occurred eventually in this scenario, it just would have taken a lot longer.",1299164514

2519586,comment,2519004,2519004,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"I've got 'real' email addresses, but still use my gmail address with some clients, partially because it's one of the few things that I can be guaranteed to use at a client's office - I'm often blocked from anything except port 80 when I'm onsite.  Yes yes, I can set up my own webmail, but I don't.  And I'm not comfortable using google domains stuff, so I split.  Probably 50% of my mail with some clients is over gmail, but I have multiple real domains, and much correspondance happens from there as well.  I find some clients bounce around - they've got their 'work' email, but they exchange emails from 'home' accounts sometimes too.  I don't consider them 'unprofessional' for doing so.<p>As someone else mentioned too, the 'have your own agreement' thing - well, I've got one, but have only used it a handful of times.  More than half my projects have been with mid to larger orgs that already have their standard procedures in place.  To use my own contracts either means I don't get the gig, or things will take a few extra weeks while ""their people"" review things, and they'll inevitably find something to complain about.  They are <i>not</i> going to agree to resolve legal issues in my state if they're out of state, so, do I bend, or hold firm?  There's no right or wrong answer - each person has different tolerance for this, and it'll probably change over time.<p>I understand the frustration with people just using the term 'freelancer' without really being a fulltimer - I started indieconf.com last year to address some of these issues that we all deal with, and avoided the term 'freelance' because I think it has a bad connotation.  It conjures up images of the unemployed designer between fulltime jobs.  Undeservedly so, perhaps, but that's what I was finding.  ""Independent web professional"" is a bit of a mouthful, but conveys a stronger image (and encompasses more than just designers or developers).<p>The big danger anyone faces in hiring a 'freelancer' is that they won't necessarily stick around for the whole project, or may not be available later to provide followup support.  Yes, you face the same with employees, but it's somewhat less of a threat in most cases.  That was something I was surprised that the blog post didn't address (or did I miss it?).",1304643590

2519557,comment,2519396,2519396,1,0,rubergly,,,"I don't agree with Marco's logic here, but I'm glad that he acknowledges that most people won't remember to go review an app. I think the best solution is to prompt users who consistently use the app for some long time period (30 days, maybe?). I agree that apps that ask for a review as soon as or soon after you load them the first or second time are extremely annoying (""I haven't even gotten to use this, how am I supposed to know what to say about it?!""), but I don't think there's anything intrinsic about a dialog box that makes it annoying if it's timed well. I often enjoy when an app asks me to review it after using it consistently a couple of times, and it _improves_ my conception of the app. Anyway, here are the two main points I disagree with:<p>I think he's greatly exaggerating the hassle of a single dialog box appearing when someone loads Instapaper. The quote he opens with describes leaving a review prompted by one of these dialog boxes as interrupting your flow; it really doesn't. If you don't want to review the app, then you hit ""no thanks,"" and that's it; if you want to review the app, but need to use the app right now, then you hit ""remind me later""; if you want to review the app, and this happens to be a convenient time for you, then you hit ""review."" Sure, this is annoying if you're perpetually hitting the ""remind me later,"" but that means that user <i>really wants to review the app</i> but doesn't have time; if they want to review the app that much, then they probably find it a feature to be reminded! At the very least, perpetually seeing the dialog could make them no longer want to review the app, but I don't think it would hurt their image of the app as a whole at all. And if you don't want to review the app, which is probably a large portion of users, then you hit ""no thanks,"" and that's the end of it; is that really that inconvenient? A one-time dialog box that's easily dismissed? This reminds me of when I worked on a team last summer rewriting <a href=""https://weather.torproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://weather.torproject.org/</a>, and we spent hours discussing/arguing amongst ourselves and with members of the Tor project whether it was okay to send <i>one</i> email to Tor router operators describing Tor Weather or if router operators would be annoyed by the spam. It was my personal opinion that this was a very silly waste of time, since very few people would see <i>one useful email targeted at a specific group of people</i> as spam. Things start to look like spam when they reappear or show up in your inbox when you have no interest in it. If you're a Tor router operator, you'd probably like to know about a service that tracks the status of your router. I digress, because Tor users (especially users interested enough to run their own routers) seemed to be particularly sensitive to receiving spam, so our decision to not email the list of operators describing the service for the most part made sense given the audience. The point is: are owners of an iPhone or iPad on average going to be <i>that</i> annoyed by a single dialog if they don't want to see it? If they do want to see it, they find it useful; if they don't, they close it. Is closing a single dialog box that painful? Really? Also, when you start to describe your app as a great product, you have to start comparing it to other apps that your audience uses. Say all their other apps use dialog boxes to prompt for reviews. Are they really going to think of Instapaper as that much better and solid of an app because it's the one app that didn't ask for a review? I agree that it does seem classier, in theory, to not beg your users for a review, but does any end user who doesn't read Marco's blog ever get that impression? I certainly didn't until I read this post. I use Instapaper a ton, and I love it. But I never realized it didn't ask for a review. I only notice when I'm asked for a review, not when I'm not. So many apps ask for reviews now that expecting your users to remember which apps <i>haven't</i> asked for reviews is basically idiotic to expect of anyone.<p>Not everyone who buys his app searches for the app by name because they heard the app was so great and is going to buy it without question. Whether Marco wants to admit it or not, he <i>does</i> have competition in the form of ReadItLater (I don't know about in the iPad space, but at least in the iPhone space). It is completely reasonable that a user would, having heard about the two products, compare the reviews/ratings on the App Store before committing and buying one or the other. Personally, I tried both apps before deciding which one I was going to use, but I don't think most people care that much. Also, this is especially important since ReadItLater has a free version. Users who can't decide can try RIL for free, but they have to pay $5 ($2 more than RIL Pro) to even get a glimpse at Instapaper; if Instapaper's reviews aren't better than RIL's, then why would they ever do that?",1304642544

You might blame the passengers causing the problem, but as a passenger I also expect the airline to anticipate and work around any frequent sources of disruption. If it's something that happens often enough to actually be a problem, then it's an operational problem and they should find some way to mitigate it. For example, they could include it as a factor when evaluating pricing strategies (the likely operations-disrupting effect of certain pricing strategies), or perhaps they could handle check-in and luggage-tracking differently, or they could police their fare rules more stringently to more strongly discourage it.<p>But they should do <i>something</i>, if indeed it is a problem (I'm not sure it actually is).

This is the book that my buddy the fab manager has on his shelf.<p>There is a chapter of <i>The Goal</i> in which the protagonist <i>literally</i> learns about how manufacturing works by helping a Scout troop of 12-year-olds move faster on their cross-country hike. You need to go to the library and read just that chapter. Then maybe have your son read it.<p>If you want a detailed summary of what the book is about I can't do better than Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints</a><p>(though that is <i>way</i> less readable than Goldratt's book) and if you want a summary of the summary it would go something like this:<p>Modern manufacturing is closer to your ""pull"" description than to ""push"". Everyone hates inventory of finished goods, and they hate inventory of half-finished goods even more. So the goal is to make stuff only as fast as it is being sold.<p>You control how fast you make stuff by controlling how much material you put into the factory at step zero. And you decide <i>that</i> by measuring every step in the process and figuring out the slowest step. The slowest step is the constraint. In your example, it's Employee 2. Because Employee 2 can only make 40 widgets per day, your factory can only make 40 widgets per day. This leads to a bunch of important management facts:<p>A) To avoid having half-finished inventory piling up on the assembly line, don't start more than 40 widgets' worth of work in a day. Anything extra will be wasted anyway. Have Employee 1 only work half the time. Or, equivalently, give Employee 1 only 40 widgets' worth of raw material each day. (In the real world, of course, every step has less than 100% yield, so maybe you start 50 widgets in order to end up with 40 widgets entering step two.)<p>B) If you need more widgets per day, you need not upgrade everything in the factory. You need only upgrade Employee 2. Hire Employees 2b and 2c and 2d. Or: Notice that Employee 1 is now only working half the time. Perhaps if Employee 1 was <i>less</i> efficient, but in a particular way that made Employee 2 <i>more</i> efficient, it would speed up Employee 2, which would speed up the whole factory. Have Employee 1 work part time cranking out her 40-or-so widgets and spend the rest of her time fetching coffee and tools for Employee 2.<p>C) Eventually you will find that you've upgraded Employee 2 to the point that he is no longer the constraint. The constraint will move. Maybe it will now be Employee 1. If so, get to work upgrading Employee 1, or making <i>her</i> job go faster. Or maybe you've moved the constraint completely out of the factory: You can now make more parts than your salespeople can sell and the constraint is the marketplace, in which case you need to make some commercials and attend more trade shows.",1304642379

So you've got to bootstrap yourself up (I'm learning this as I go).<p>So far I've found that at $0.99 I am lucky to get 1-2 sales a day. However, on my first app that was kind of experimental, I made it free and immediately got 255 downloads that day, and it leveled off to about 25 a day after a week. Still not great, but at least 25x install base.<p>So the next step is figuring out how to make an app start to build a network. One big part of this is ratings. I can't make a free app purchase-only until it has word of mouth. This needs ratings.<p>For the 2nd app I just released, I have baked in a ""Please review me"" that only fires after 3 days, Facebook and Twitter sharing. I launched it free.

Not everyone on the government side is necessarily on the same page, and over the 5-year lifetime of this case several of the people involved may have changed jobs.<p>The US attorney representing the FBI in court might have been acting in good faith, for example, because someone within the FBI had decided that neither the court nor the attorney had a 'need to know' about the existence of other documents. Establishing exactly who made that decision and how many other people knew about it and when they knew etc. etc. will require a separate investigation. (I have only read the opinion so far, and not looked at the procedural history of the case which might answer some of those questions.)<p>My understanding is that there are a few costs to the government when this happens. There's an investigation as mentioned above, which can take years. In the short term, the government may have to pay some or all of the plaintiff's legal costs - that can also take years, but it has an immediate effect on agencies' budget planning. Lastly, either the government appeals or the decision will be cited in existing or future litigation about similar issues.<p>I have a hunch that there will be a huge amount of information- and security-related litigation against the government for the next 5-10 years. Now that Osama bin Laden is gone there will be increasing domestic pressure to reassess foreign policy, military commitments, and the role of security in public life. People are tired of the war on terror and the security theater that goes with it, and bin Laden's death is a sufficiently large milestone that legal and legislative debates will broaden considerably.

It is at least possible these days to get a ""principles of CS"" education. But the principles of front-end are somewhat different.<p>1. This is the web. Users will resize the window, copy and paste, click a button five times, turn off JavaScript, and arrive from every possible combination of browser, operating system, and language. You will maintain an appropriate fear of any trick so complicated that you don't know what it will do under all of those circumstances.<p>2. The user is always right. Even when they run unpatched IE7 with JavaScript and CSS on but images hidden.<p>Then a few pointers I would like to add:<p>- Think twice before binding to every instance of an event. Are you looking for a keydown, a mouse move, or a scroll? Throttle your function to make sure it runs only ten times a second, or whatever is appropriate. Ironically, the faster browsers and JS environments become, the slower your pages will be if you calculate something on all 1000 scroll events per second.<p>- For heaven's sake try to avoid absolutely positioning your whole interface. But if you do, you better try it in every browser and resize it real fast to see if it works.",1304640922

We err on the side of caution, and the set we use allows the majority of sites to operate without issue.  We'd rather spend 10 minutes on a ticket explaining to the customer that it's just us being overly cautious than any real issue.  We have to weigh risk mitigation vs usability.<p>Also, probably >95% of the ""website hacks"" I see are automated, so mod_security really does greatly cut down on the number of exploits.  Sure, if you have a dedicated hacker who knows his or her way around things like modsec, then it won't matter at all, but the number of hacks we've seen has decreased greatly due to mod_security.  You only get into trouble with it if you pretend that it's anything more than it is: regex filtering for requests.<p>To the guy talking about validating input...perhaps you should spend a bit more time on the internet and notice all the sites running copies of WordPress with defaults.  This is how the vast majority of websites are...default everything.  Input validation is great if you have a custom app and a development team, but most people don't.  While it's arguable that they should even be running their own site, it doesn't change the fact that they do.  They don't have time, and we don't have time to go through all of their PHP that accepts _GET and _POST and make sure that they're handling input validation / sanitation properly.  Yes, the people who develop wordpress / whatever CMS they're using should set some good defaults for input validation and use proper sanitation techniques, but the truth is that tons of sites run on shaky code bases and old versions...so mod_security is the ""quick fix"" that covers the vast majority of cases and protects tons of our users.<p>suPHP is great too (privilege separation).  Combined with jailkit, our systems are pretty well locked down for shared hosting.<p>That all said, Sony SERIOUSLY screwed this up.  Their system should have better secured the Cardholder Data Environment (the PCI-DSS name for any system that touches CC info).  My guess would be poor architecture planning / implementation as to why this obviously wasn't done.  Also, mod_security has some filters for data leakage which can be tweaked to prevent obvious HIPAA stuff and obvious PCI-DSS stuff, such as plaintext transfer of zillions of CC numbers.  If a skilled hacker broke into this, he/she again could pretty easily find a way around this.<p>Network firewalls probably wouldn't have helped much in this case, unless they did something really stupid like leaving SSH open to the world.  If it was just a site exploit, shame on them for having such a poor system (shame on them anyway for setting up a system that allows this to happen).",1304640284

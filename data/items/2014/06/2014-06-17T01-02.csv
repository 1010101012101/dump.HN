The cheaper shoes, IOW, will not <i>actually</i> be so bad that you have to replace them entirely, and you will in fact end up with with more liquid savings.  The temporary discomfort and greater savings are much harder to compare to the alternative than the example suggests, so wealthier people do not always have some obvious choice that leaves them better off in every way.<p>So, on top of that, it&#x27;s not an issue that is fixable simply by pointing this out to the poorer person and loaning them the money.",1402970166

Something along the lines of:<p>&quot;Share your vinyl collection with the world and discover theirs&quot;<p>Then add a subtle pitch about Needle:<p>&quot;If you love vinyl, you&#x27;ll love Needle&quot;<p>After that, I would offer the call to action. Your current call to action needs some attention.<p>You have 2 buttons next to each other that are the same size. Both are ghost buttons. Both are asking the reader to  take two different paths.<p>What do you want the user to do most?<p>I&#x27;m assuming you want them to download the app from the App Store. Make that button the biggest. Make it a solid color that pops out from the background. I would test both an Orange button and a Green button to see which gets the most clicks.<p>I would add the &quot;Available on the App Store&quot; to your Download button to add that immediate sense of security that this is a real verified app backed by Apple. Even though it isn&#x27;t, people get that impression and it helps to have it front and center with the action you want them to take.<p>I would change the &quot;Watch the Video&quot; button to a text link under the download button. That will be the indicator to let the visitor know that they can scroll down to see more. Add a downward arrow icon under it and you create a path to continue moving down for more information. Repeat that arrow throughout the page to create motion.<p>Back to the headline, I would remove the large logo and put your headline there. You have branding in the upper left corner. There&#x27;s really no need to repeat it, especially in that most important real estate.<p>Regarding the content, it could use a proof-read. I don&#x27;t mean any offense but it reads like English may not be your first language.<p>There are grammar issues here and there that could be cleaned up, for example:<p>&quot;we got lot of ideas&quot; should be &quot;we have a lot of ideas&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;ve got a lot of ideas&quot;.<p>I would move the Record Labels and Advertise to separate landing pages devoted to those features. This landing page should be about downloading the app and becoming part of a worldwide vinyl loving community.<p>If I were a vinyl enthusiast, I wouldn&#x27;t care about the record label part.<p>Though it isn&#x27;t necessary, I would add in some imagery or icons to the content. It&#x27;s pretty text heavy (even though the textual content is minimal).<p>For example, putting the &quot;Share&quot;, &quot;Dig&quot;, &quot;Stream&quot; content blocks next to each other with some nice related icons above the respective content would reader really well, catch people&#x27;s attention and visually shorten that content section.<p>I like that you used some language that is familiar to vinyl lovers. &quot;Dig through thousands of vinyl records...&quot; captures a real emotion for vinyl enthusiasts. Now if you had a nice illustration that helped bring it home, it would work well.<p>Last thing I would do is tweak the black and white background with the record. It doesn&#x27;t have enough contrast with the white text over it and you have to scroll up and down to read the content sometimes as the white text blends in with the white of the image.<p>Overall, it is a nice design. It has a hip feel to it in that it uses some current trends.<p>Good Luck with the app.",1402970005

Size is REALLY important, it&#x27;s not like you can just declare an &quot;int&quot; and know in your heart it is &quot;big enough&quot;, you need to absolutely be sure that the values you put in it will fit.  So I like using explicitly sized integers in all situations, why not?  The <i>ONLY</i> argument I can fathom for &quot;let the compiler decide on this integer&#x27;s size&quot; is performance, and frankly if that is your performance problem (and not disk I/O) then you need to be focusing on that problem WAAAAAAY more than just letting the compiler decide how big your integer is.",1402969901

The usual use of optional fields in Protobufs was to emulate unions, which Protobufs itself never supported directly, but Cap&#x27;n Proto does. Also, when wire size really matters, Cap&#x27;n Proto offers a very fast compression pass which deflates zeros, and unset fields are always zero, largely mitigating this issue.<p>The lack of VS support in Cap&#x27;n Proto is of course a very fair criticism, and a huge sore point in Cap&#x27;n Proto adoption.

7902445,comment,7901991,7901991,65,0,kentonv,,,"Huh. So Google is releasing a competitor to Cap&#x27;n Proto. As the former maintainer of Protobufs (at Google) and author of Cap&#x27;n Proto (after Google), I&#x27;m pretty surprised that I hadn&#x27;t heard about this. I also don&#x27;t recognize any of the names, so this is not from the people who were working on Protobufs at the time I left.<p>I&#x27;m the main competitor, so take me with a grain of salt here.<p>The docs don&#x27;t look very detailed, but taking a quick look through...<p>> &quot;On purpose, the format leaves a lot of details about where exactly things live in memory undefined, e.g. fields in a table can have any order... To be able to access fields regardless of these uncertainties, we go through a vtable of offsets. Vtables are shared between any objects that happen to have the same vtable values.&quot;<p>Hrm, that sounds like a lot of complexity and a big performance hit. In order to read a field from a struct, you have to do a vtable lookup to find the offset? Maybe you can still get that done in an inline accessor, but it will make the optimizer sad.<p>How is de-duping of vtables accomplished? It doesn&#x27;t look like the API exposes any details about vtables, meaning you&#x27;d have to do it magically behind the scenes, which seems expensive?<p>It looks like the authors may have been trying to maintain the concept of &quot;optional fields&quot; from Protobufs, where if you don&#x27;t set an optional field, it takes zero bytes on the wire. But the main use of optional fields in practice is to implement unions -- i.e. a list of fields where only one should be filled in at a time.<p>Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s solution to this was just to build unions into the language, something Protobufs should have done a long time ago.<p>> &quot;FlatBuffers relies on new field declarations being added at the end, and earlier declarations to not be removed, but be marked deprecated when needed. We think this is an improvement over the manual number assignment that happens in Protocol Buffers.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not an improvement at all. Declarations should be ordered semantically, so that related things go together. More importantly, even if you say that they can&#x27;t be, developers will still do it, and will accidentally introduce incompatibilities. To make matters worse, it tends to be hard to detect these issues in testing, because your tests are probably build from the latest code. Simply adding field numbers as in Protobufs and Cap&#x27;n Proto has proven an effective solution to this in practice.<p>Very surprised to see Google get this wrong, since they have more experience with this than anyone.<p>> Benchmarks<p>I couldn&#x27;t find the benchmark code in the github repo, so it&#x27;s hard to say what they may be measuring here. FlatBuffers presumably shares Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s property that encodes and decodes take zero time, which makes it hard to create a meaningful benchmark in the first place. Indeed the numbers they put up kind of look like they&#x27;re timing a noop loop. I can&#x27;t see how the &quot;traverse&quot; time could be so much better than with protobufs, which makes me think the code might be written in such a way that the compiler was able to optimize away all the traverse time for FlatBuffers because it thought the results were unused anyway -- a mistake that&#x27;s easy to make.<p>But I&#x27;d love to see the code to verify. Hopefully I just missed it when digging through the repo.",1402969422

Driving to that direct engagement (to either ask for referrals/recommendations from Promoters or recover Detractors).<p>We&#x27;re very excited to have recently launched Promoter.io (www.promoter.io), a platform built specifically to help companies not only measure and track their NPS, but drive more valuable/actionable insights out of the data and open-ended feedback. We also heavily streamline the process of customer engagement post-survey.<p>We don&#x27;t allow customers to change (or &quot;break&quot;) the survey.

7902416,comment,7902134,7902134,2,0,User9812,,,"That seems like a good idea, and I could see hotel visitors wanting to select a room overlooking the parking lot (to watch a vehicle), or wanting to be on a particular side of the building (avoiding highway noise), etc. People have all sorts of little preferences, so I think that feature would get a lot of use. They also like being familiar with a room, so I could see them booking the identical one on their next trip.<p>Since we&#x27;re talking about hotels, I think the business in general has a lot of faults. I get more perks at a $10 per night hostel or $50/night Airbnb apartment, than I do at a $300 per night hotel.<p>When you book a hotel for $300 per night, they nickel and dime you for everything. Wifi? You&#x27;ll need to register for it at the front desk, and pay $20 per day. Oh, want a bottle of water, or small snack, that&#x27;s another $10. That hostel, or cheap-o hotel will give you free wifi. I&#x27;d say half of the Airbnb places I&#x27;ve stayed at left beer or a bottle of wine in the fridge, and a few places had a giant fresh platter of fruit on the kitchen table.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t this happen with a $300 per night hotel? To me, this is a complete turn off. I&#x27;ll avoid the fancy hotels, because I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;ll end. They&#x27;re trying to gouge me at every single corner when I&#x27;ve paid a premium, and instead of being an appreciated customer, I feel like I&#x27;m being taken advantage of. My parents are well off, and I know they feel the same way. When they go on vacation and stay at a high end hotel, they have to tip people left and right. They&#x27;re forced to use the staff at the entrance for carrying their bags up to the room, and then they need their wallet ready to tip them for that 2 minutes of work. What kind of awful first impression is that? You&#x27;re on vacation, paid a small fortune for a room, and within minutes you need to shell out more cash.<p>Yes, I know their thought process is they can squeeze absurd prices out of people that have money, but I think it&#x27;s completely backwards and destroys their image and sense of luxury.<p>I think there&#x27;s a business for a mid-range hotel with perks. Take a mid-range hotel with $150 per night rooms. Add $15 of free perks, and charge $165 per night for your rooms. With that $15, you could give every visitor free wifi, 2 bottles of water, a couple of bananas/oranges, bag of chips, couple of health bars, bottle of juice, 2 beers or a bottle of wine, and small bag of nuts. To me, that&#x27;s a huge difference in service and experience for a small price. It would make me book that place every night of the week, and I&#x27;d recommend it to others. I&#x27;d put employees or clients up in such a place, knowing they&#x27;re feeling pampered. Why doesn&#x27;t this exist? Would this not be appealing to anyone else?",1402968827

The disruptive companies start out providing a &quot;worse&quot; product, for the purposes of the legacy companies&#x27; market niches, but that satisfies another niche, frequently (always?) a new one.  One that the legacy companies are ill or entirely unfit to satisfy.<p>With the experience in those lower end niche markets, the disruptive innovator eventually moves up market with a better product, and legacy companies can evaporate &quot;overnight&quot; as these things go.<p>My favorite example was steam powered excavators vs. hydraulic, post-WWII (plenty of weapons systems used hydraulic actuators, they were fast).  The former were used for big stuff, as I recall nothing smaller than sewage lines.  The initial hydraulic ones had a bucket size of, say, 1/4 a cubic yard, way too small for what the former did.<p>But they were just the right size for providing utility access to a home, a market which exploded after the war, a market which was previously handled by guys with picks and shovels.<p>Quality, and the size of the jobs they could take on, steadily improved, until they could do what steam excavators could do ... without the danger of a chain snapping and hitting the operator or others.  At which point they had a vastly superior product, satisfying a previously unrealized desire, and the legacy companies died fairly quick and hard deaths (he goes a lot more into why they generally can&#x27;t adopt the new technology before it&#x27;s too late).<p>The book had similar examples of &quot;dirt bikes&quot;, the not very hi-fi Sony transistor radio (I think), and of course several generations of disk drives, for which he had the best data and for which I had the best background (starting programming in 1977 so I watched the transitions).<p>OK, now read the section of the article pertaining to excavators, and off the top of my head, I&#x27;ve never heard of O. & K. and Demag, and I&#x27;ll note Hitachi probably suffered serious destruction and disruption of the physical plant and business as part of our WWII bombing campaign (just read the book Whirlwind on that, really bad).<p>Bucyrus <i>is</i> a company I&#x27;ve heard of, in terms of their <i>huge</i> machines, that were used to operate big mines and the like (I live close to this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brutus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brutus</a>, and while a Cub or Boy Scout in the &#x27;70s visited it while it was still operational, and a power plant I think it fed).  Their doing OK until the US largely ended that sort of thing (NIMBY, BANANA, etc.) could easily reconcile both observations.  That the author didn&#x27;t try to make the case that their excavator business stayed healthy is probably telling.<p>Hmmm, per Wikipedia, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demag"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demag</a> Demag was a big crane and the like company, and until being bought by an American company in 2011, did &quot;<i>bridge cranes, hoists, material handling equipment, gantry cranes and port technology.</i>&quot;  But I did find hits on their name and excavator.<p>O. & K. is another former German company: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orenstein_%26_Koppel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orenstein_%26_Koppel</a> where excavators are prominently mentioned in the Wikipedia article.

But I wouldn&#x27;t describe &quot;preventative maintenance&quot; by police as necessarily bad, if (and that&#x27;s the big question) it can help avoid direct negative consequences down the road where those negative consequences outweigh the hassle of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>At some point living with other people will necessarily inconvenience you, whether it&#x27;s sobriety checkpoints, or directing traffic, or jury dury, or voting, or taxes, or any of the dozens of other things that go into the civic duties of maintaining the general welfare.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a balance that must be chosen (e.g. the speed traps in rural Georgia that are so dense that you have to assume they are more for revenue than for safety), but I don&#x27;t think police activity only becomes legitimate when it&#x27;s directly focused on a specific and known criminal occurrence.",1402966821

Want to create a study group to learn about painting, same thing. If you go to study say engineering physics at a masters program, they&#x27;ll also force you to learn at least the basics in fields like construction, electrical engineering, software engineering, etc. When you exit high school, even if you&#x27;ve taken a scientific route, you&#x27;ve learned about wood work, mechanical engineering, probably at least 2 languages beyond Swedish, etc.<p>Part of this I think is attributable to the culture isn&#x27;t so focused on knowledge being measured or &quot;accounted for&quot; financially.<p>A second reason is probably that it&#x27;s pretty cold in Sweden in the winters, but I don&#x27;t think that has nearly as much to do with it.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m born 77 and left the country 99. Some people claim that education isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be. I don&#x27;t know, but I think most of the people creating kick ass products right now are people that were born in the 80s or earlier.",1379977178

It worked fine.</i><p>I&#x27;ll gladly admit that having a browser that does graphics is a huge improvement over a browser that only displays text, like lynx. But browsers have been supporting graphics since what, 1995? Earlier?<p>Since graphical browsers appeared, IMO, there has been exactly one UI innovation in browsers that was worth the effort to re-learn things: the Chrome UI, that basically got rid of the UI except for the address/search bar and the browser window itself. I&#x27;m fine with having to re-learn where all the menu options are if I need them, in exchange for that simplification. But that happened in what, 2008?<p>Of course there have been plenty of changes behind the scenes in browsers, such as security fixes, support for HTML 5 and updates to Javascript, etc. None of those affect the UI, and I&#x27;m not talking about those kinds of changes. I&#x27;m talking specifically about changes to the UI that force people to re-learn things for no good reason.",1379977151

High karma can mean people have agreed with you, or that you&#x27;ve been here longer than not, and it probably is a good measure that you can conform to the norms of the community, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you know what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>I mean, people will listen when tptacek talks about cryptography, but that doesn&#x27;t mean his opinion on design should necessarily matter more than that of a designer with less karma just because tptacek has the bigger integer attached to his name. It&#x27;s not really more &#x27;fair&#x27; for votes by high karma users to outweigh votes by lower karma users.<p>Unless it already works that way in which case it&#x27;s the best thing ever and clearly pg is going God&#x27;s work.",1379977078
6434718,comment,6433908,6434603,2,0,mratzloff,,,"> <i>I actually think paying for certain masters degrees, for example in computer science or engineering, is a better financial investment than paying for most law schools.</i><p>Considering putting cash under your mattress is a better investment than paying for law school, yes, you are technically correct.<p>However, I don&#x27;t know how &quot;worth it&quot; financially even a master&#x27;s degree in Computer Science is.  At best, I feel like it&#x27;s break even in most cases: the year or two you spend getting the degree might be better spent on the job, especially if you have a decent mentor.<p>In one case, a guy I mentored directly out of undergraduate ended up going back and getting his master&#x27;s.  I think he&#x27;d say that it made him feel more confident with certain concepts, but then, I picked up the equivalent information in the course of my 10-year career with only an undergraduate degree.  Any reasonably curious programmer would.  It certainly did not make a difference in his income.<p>As for PhDs, I have never hired one.  They seem to universally have an inability to think concretely or in a step-by-step manner.  They have the skill set of a junior developer but expect the salary of a senior developer (at least).  Ultimately, I can only imagine hiring one if they had significant experience in a very specific area that is difficult to hire for.",1379977064

Which in fact I&#x27;m pretty sure they already must have, besides the PR angle.<p><i>The solution to bad people doing bad things can&#x27;t always be to hack the legs off of everyone at the kneecaps and put everyone in a &quot;safe&quot; wheelchair.</i><p>This is an extremely broad argument to a particular situation, and those are rarely fruitful. But in any case: Bad people are rarely the real problem, they are relatively few. The real problem is culture and institutions that lead regular people to do bad things. <i>Facilis decensus Averno</i>. And if in a private context I believe the imposition of such rules should be avoided, I don&#x27;t think the same applies to a public institution.<p><i>A better solution is that if you see a government agency misrepresenting themselves in media... point it out.

6434713,comment,6433908,6434544,5,0,bradleyjg,,,"Yale Law School is <i>sui generis</i>. A full majority of its very small classes go on to clerk at the federal appellate level. While tenured law professor is still something of a long shot even for these top-of-the-top it&#x27;s not the powerball lottery ticket that virtually all the rest of academia is (they average around 3-4 tenured professors per class of around 200), and there are other fulfilling career tracks uniquely open to people who went to Yale and then clerked at the appellate level.<p>For other schools on your list it&#x27;s a different story. They certainly have a better chance, perhaps even a good chance, of getting the BigLaw job golden ring than most law graduates. But in my observation that&#x27;s a bit of poisoned chalice. It pays well but the work is mostly tedious, the hours are very very long -- with no slowdown as your career advances -- and the atmosphere is extremely stressful.<p>There are some good public interest jobs for people who for whatever reason aren&#x27;t money driven (usually because they have money already!) but the competition is fierce even for Harvard and Stanford grads because of all the burned out BigLaw associates looking to get out. Although the jobs are often interesting and sometimes fulfilling, they almost invariably require long hours. Almost all legal jobs do.",1379977016

6434704,comment,6433458,6433458,1,0,mas644,,,"As I always used to tell my students, your degree is just a piece of paper that helps you get your foot in the door. Its worth is equivalent to the effort and energy you put into it. Those that work hard and are passionate about their major, whether it be computer science or whether it be philosophy -- they&#x27;ll end up doing well in their chosen fields -- or at the very least grow as people. If you&#x27;re really into what you study, spend a lot of your extracurricular activities in related areas (e.g. being in debate club if you&#x27;re a political science major), and are excited about working in a field pertaining to your major, you will do well. If you came just to party, socialize, and not major in something that you didn&#x27;t care about or find challenging...you&#x27;ll likely not get your return on the investment. I majored with plenty of people in computer science, some were even able to cheat their way to decent grades. However, we all know how well that works when you have to sit down for an interview at Google or wherever and you have a blank stare when you can&#x27;t tell the difference between a binary tree and an apple tree. Your computer science degree in that case is almost worthless.<p>So it&#x27;s worth it if you know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into. Some people think it&#x27;s just a rubber stamp to a job that pays a minimum of $50K a year somewhere in the city where they can continue partying. Not true unfortunately. I knew since I was a child what I wanted to study...for most the answer is not that easy. I always suggest that if you don&#x27;t know what you want to do, don&#x27;t go into debt by going to college without a plan. Do something else -- join peace corps, volunteer, get an apprenticeship...maybe join a community college first. Getting a college education is one of the most fantastic and redefining experiences a person can have -- you may only have one shot and should feel blessed you have that opportunity. Don&#x27;t squander it.",1379976919
6434703,comment,6434325,6434325,15,0,zacinbusiness,,,"I got married at 21 to a girl I&#x27;d been dating for 6 years. We moved off to our own rented place a year before that when we started college. At that point we were supposed to be adults but a lot of the time it just felt like we were playing house. We constantly had bills coming due that we couldn&#x27;t pay, we struggled to eat, and I even sold my own vehicle at a $9,000 loss once to pay half of our over-due rent.<p>It was a nightmare that lasted about...4 years...but things slowly got better.<p>We each graduated with our B.A.s (barely) and went on to complete Master&#x27;s degrees with high marks (her a 4. 0 and me a 3.9) and each with glowing recommendations from our professors and colleagues.<p>Along the way we have made horrible mistakes, learned tons of really hard lessons, and become better people for it.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I can pinpoint any specific time that we &quot;became adults.&quot; But I know that we are each closer now than we were when we first got married. But from conversations with our families, our story isn&#x27;t all that different from my parents or hers, or our grandparents. The main difference is that our families had the ability to help us through the darkest times, where as their families did not. And I think that is one reason that it may seem like the &quot;age of adulthood&quot; has become extended: people usually adapt pretty well to their situations. So, when my grandfather was married at 19 and he had to feed his family he didn&#x27;t have anyone to count on for help. I knew I could always ask for help if I needed to (although it made me hate myself when I did). So, it took longer to become independent because I wasn&#x27;t forced to do so by my situation.<p>Not sure if that is normal for most people, but it&#x27;s how it was for us.",1379976906

6434700,comment,6427029,6431347,3,0,belorn,,,"Lets first not confuse the issue too much, and note that the number of GPL licensed software projects is increasing by each year. The &quot;fragmentation&quot; you are talking about is not a clean cut. GPLv3 added a bunch compatibility with GPLv2 incompatible license, which for example MPL users was quite happy about. This has clearly helped brining the free software community closer, rather than more fragmented.<p>As for any added restrictions, GPLv3 added two things exactly:<p>1#) they added a clause that says users should have the right to exercise the permission given by the license to devices those users own. Adding technical, rather the legal restrictions is equally restrictive to the user.<p>2#) They copied the patent clause from apache license, and included the term &quot;patent agreement&quot; to it.<p>If you do not intend to add technical restrictions to customers owned devices, and you or your business partners don&#x27;t intend to sue for patents when people use software that you distribute under GPL, GPLv3 will give the exact same legal instructions as GPLv2.<p>Many BSD projects approves of Apple use of BSD. Apple will add technical restrictions to devices owned by their customers, and Apple will sue for patents if they see a business edge in doing so. GPLv3 and FSF do not approve, and that cause the BSD and GPLv3 to view Apple in different light. If you need to take a &quot;side&quot;, feel free to do so, but I won&#x27;t see either BSD or FSF as evil, nor do I think its appropriate to view their disagreement in that light.",1379976881

6434698,comment,6434325,6434325,1,0,smtddr,,,"Complicated.<p>While I understand the whole social push of &quot;be more mature&quot;, I think there&#x27;s something to be said of having a healthy carefree childhood & young-adult-funtime. I think 18 is fine if only because society supports this cutoff. Since you can get in trouble with the law like an &quot;adult&quot; at 18, you better understand consequences by then. Personally, I think there&#x27;s plenty of time to figure out adulthood(barring horrible life-changing mistakes) but losing out on your childhood & young-adult years is a greater loss than not being &quot;mature&quot; by 25.
 But that&#x27;s just my viewpoint, to put some context around it I think the people who condemn shows like the jersey shore are (sub)consciously jealous they couldn&#x27;t live life that way or somehow lost out on their childhood/young-adult-funtime and think their speedy rise to &quot;maturity&quot; is something everyone should strive for.

I agree that failing to manage my login permissions exposes me to problems. But a system that makes it this easy for people to get screwed is a bad system.  In my case the only downside is that I get annoying emails - but giving inbox permissions on fb or email exposes you to huuuuuge problems.  People keep all kind of things there that they shouldn&#x27;t - passwords, I&#x27;ll bet you have ten friends with their social security or all kinds of PHI in their gmail. In my case I take responsibility for the silly emails I get because of it.  I <i>also</i> go through fb and google permissions and cull them, but that is not always enough, especially if you&#x27;re facing a malicious site. But my problem isn&#x27;t how this affects me, it&#x27;s how it affects users who don&#x27;t understand the danger here - which is most people.  Some people think the answer is either &quot;everyone learns to code or everyone loses control/rights&quot;, but I think that doesn&#x27;t make sense.  You don&#x27;t expect everyone who drives to fix their cars themselves, and when one breaks and hurts them you don&#x27;t mock them for their carelessness in getting such a complicated piece of equipment (I hope).  We always abstract complexity away from new technology so that it can be used conveniently and safely, which is great.  In the same way I think people building complicated web tools should do so responsibly, so that their users don&#x27;t expose themselves to problems by using them.  You don&#x27;t have to abuse access permissions to make a great tool, and I&#x27;m willing to bet that these controls will get more and more tightly controlled to keep things like this from happening.

If you are answering yes to these kinds of questions, you will most likely be able to get an academic job at a research university or a major liberal arts college. Seriously. I fit into this profile, defended in 2012, and have a tenure track job. I was in a small cohort--three people--but two of us have tenure track jobs and the other is in a high profile post-doc. I looked at all the PhDs from the last 5 years of my program. 8 people have TT jobs, 1 has a post-doc, and 3 have industry jobs, but 1 of those 3 really wanted an industry jobs when he entered. No one is unemployed, and we&#x27;re talking about the roughest years from 2008 on.<p>Yes, it is not the case that a PhD guarantees you an academic job without reference to your department, thesis topic, and advisor.

Granted, links generated from various mapping platforms could still be sent around, with or without proper addressing. However, these links are not able of being consumed by 3rd parties in any reasonable way, and so integration is our second goal. We want our users to not only have complete control of their location data in a robust, machine-readable fashion, but also that they be able to use these very location data just about anywhere.

Finally, we have taken it upon ourselves to build the very best maps for this other half of the world, along with navigationally-relevant data. That is, if people in a certain region use landmarks as informal reference points, we believe that we ought to capture all of these, on the ground, and surface them through an easy-to-use tool in their local language that allows them to structure the very unstructured location data they were using before to share their where across contexts. Whether we&#x27;ll get all of these right really remains to be seen, and it certainly isn&#x27;t trivial, but this is nevertheless our vision and we think that we can realize it by looking at the issue of global location data in a holistic way, as we have been doing for the last year and a bit.",1379975124

All the while, I kept reading about the doom and gloom in the job market. Everyone, apparently, decided to go to law school after the economy crashed in 2007 and demand for jobs was rising while the supply was decreasing. Coupled with growing debt, I was really becoming concerned on whether or not the endeavor would actually pay off and if all her hard work and sacrifice was for naught. We never had the ambition (or delusion) of a 6-figure associate job at a top firm, but from all the reports, we were in an almost hopeless situation. Four years of time sacrificed, more than half of it financed with debt, the rest with savings, and good luck finding a job.<p>In the end: a job was in place before graduation.

Two suggestions for places..<p>1) If I search &quot;self storage columbia mo&quot; I get place results but if I &quot;search self storage 65203&quot; I do not get place results.  I noticed this does work for food using a more familiar zipcode like 90210.. but maybe still a little zip code work to be done.<p>2) What about when I search &quot;thai&quot; or &quot;self storage&quot; in general.  DuckDuckGo is known for not tracking the user, but if I search something that with location information would most likely provide place results, shouldn&#x27;t I be given some type of indicator that with just a zipcode or city name I could be given better results?  That way you are educating new users while still providing them the results they need and the privacy DuckDuckGo is known for.",1399319982

7700795,comment,7700312,7700735,2,0,pedrocr,,,"I think the OP is right. The first mistake he mentions is just not reading enough from urandom and thus falling back on unsecure values, which is just sloppy C. Then all the other attack scenarios require the ability to replace /dev/urandom in various insane ways (sparse actual files, symlinks, other devices). It all just seems pretty pointless. Just read /dev/urandom in a loop until you have enough and abort on any other case. That way you assure a secure result as long as the user has a sane environment and abort otherwise.",1399319913

It has little to do with &#x27;real world&#x27; optimization, which is often more about architectural issues: caching, etc.<p>2) Markerboards - I never, ever write code on a markerboard. Why ask me to write code on a marketboard in an interview? Markerboards are great for high level concept organization, they are terrible for writing code.

Its a pretty bad spot for source code other than one line notes.  I usually have scratch paper with scribbles all over it when I&#x27;m coding, so that seems fair.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written anything in Clojure without a REPL open, it would be a weird experience to write something out entirely on a whiteboard without running all the little parts first.  Also the test-driven experience is very weird if you can&#x27;t actually run tests.  Its like testing someones teamwork skills by having them work alone, very strange.<p>I feel a professional obligation to begin all projects with a bit of google to at least prove I&#x27;m not wasting effort on NIH and find some pitfalls, so the suggestions to test a dev without any net access also feels extremely weird to me.<p>I think the primary fail of tech interviews is its nothing more than a stress test, selecting for candidates who don&#x27;t really care, or at least are unnaturally calm, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to correlate very well with ability.",1399319860

While trying to learn C++ (and from one of those poor “X in 24 Hours” books, no less), she keeps getting fed more DOS-isms, erroneous constructs like “void main()” that are never to be used outside of niche embedded environments, all while a tide of people rant, rave, debate language semantics and drift off-topic in the background. Later, they switch to poor C++ syntax and do things like forget to add semicolons after procedure calls, but at that point, the article had already devolved into mayhem.<p>One of the participants, ElizabethWiethoff, slaps a deletion candidate disclaimer by the end of the ordeal, and like that the article has not been touched since August 19, 2005.<p>I found it quite humorous, as it illustrates not only the chaos of using a wiki as a bazaar-based education model, but also how the programmers can’t seem to agree with each other and hold arcane (to the pupil) technical debates in the background.

Fixed position elements on the sides of the screen make much more sense, although poor implementations are very unpleasant and can create a jarring parallax effect. Unfortunately, fixed elements on the sides are soooo MySpace and have fallen out fashion, and many sites waste most of the space on the sides. The header in the redesign in obscenely large and the new page shows me less results at a time.<p>I have young and healthy eyes with 20/20 vision. Even so, when I use my laptop for coding and reading text, I turn the brightness down because it is easier on my eyes and does not give me headaches. I believe that the best practice is to make text #000 on a white background or very light background (like news.yc does), and to let users adjust the brightness of their display if this is uncomfortable. There have been assertions by that lighter text with white is better (and unfortunately this is the latest and laziest design trend), but I have seen no formal evidence of this and believe that this is mostly a combination of overbright display screens and poor text rendering by OSes and browsers. If you turn the brightness of your screen down, you solve the &quot;too much contrast&quot; problem (if it ever truly existed) and can tell when any text isn&#x27;t #000. For me, DuckDuckgo&#x27;s current snippet display color is to light at #333, and ridiculous at #595959. If I set the brightness of my laptop to the maximum setting, the snippet text is more tolerable but still uncomfortable.<p>I dislike the neo-flat, iOS-like buttons, but they don&#x27;t really make the site any harder to use. I find that neo-flat buttons are almost have an underlying hypocrisy. The idea behind the flat painting movement is that you can discern what was called &quot;optical depth&quot; without using traditional perspective to mimic the depth you see with stereoscopic vision. The neo-flat movement is based on the idea that you don&#x27;t need to underline hyperlinks or add perspective based shadows and gradients to distinguish what a button is because you can just use colors alone or make <i>everything</i> a link. If this were really true, then you wouldn&#x27;t need to make the neo-flat buttons change colors when you mouse over them, because it should be obvious that they are links. You can see similar hypocrisy in Google&#x27;s A/B testing of non-centered labels in certain neo-flat buttons on their websites (especially YouTube).<p>Edit: I rewrote the first sentence of the third paragraph to make it more clear.",1399319003

7700676,comment,7699862,7700404,40,0,cortesoft,,,"Couple of points: Comcast isn&#x27;t buying bandwidth from Level 3.  &quot;Settlement-free peering&quot; means no money is exchanged.  The reason they don&#x27;t charge each other is because it is mutually beneficial; Comcast gets to charge it&#x27;s customers for access to content that passes through Level 3 and Level 3 gets to charge it&#x27;s customers for access to the Comcast subscribers.<p>The problem is that there is only a market solution for the Level 3 customers&#x27; side; if Level 3 can&#x27;t accept all the traffic that their customers are sending it, they have other options with who to connect to, as there are other backbone providers.  It is in their financial interest to maintain their network capacity, or their clients will go elsewhere.<p>Comcast, on the other hand, has no market pressure.  If they can&#x27;t handle all the data that their customers are trying to access, their customers have no other option.  They are stuck with Comcast.<p>And therein lies the rub; what both Level 3&#x27;s and Comcast&#x27;s customers want is access to each other.  Neither company can provide that service on their own; Comcast doesn&#x27;t have a global network that can send data around the world, while Level 3 doesn&#x27;t have a last-mile network that connects to all the end users.  However, only Level 3 has to worry about losing its customers to a competitor.  Comcast can essentially hold all parties hostage; they can demand payments from every party: end users, Level 3, and Level 3&#x27;s customers.  Of course, holding everyone hostage hurts everyone, including their own customers; however, since their customers have no other options, they aren&#x27;t really in danger of losing them.  They can hold out longer than Level 3 can, because if Level 3 doesn&#x27;t agree to pay Comcast&#x27;s ransom, someone else might, and Level 3 will lose their customers to whoever pays Comcast&#x27;s ransom.",1399318873

The article also makes the point that the capital expenditure is negligible compared to the benefit to both sides.<p>The moral hazard here is that Comcast is (shrewdly) taking the bet that their customers won&#x27;t blame them for what appears to be Netflix&#x27;s reduced performance.  If there was actual competition in the local ISP space, customers would catch on that the performance is only worse on Comcast&#x27;s network, but that&#x27;s not the world we live in.<p>> Barring, of course, the monopoly argument, I see no moral hazard here.<p>You can&#x27;t just ignore the monopoly argument.  There&#x27;s nothing inherently unfair about a monopoly, but if you use it to extort money from people then its no surprise that people call you out on it.  In the Good Old Days, you&#x27;d see monopolies try to squash their competitors.  This is more nuanced than that.  Monopolistic-extortion-action-at-a-distance, if you will.",1399318261

I haven&#x27;t found any other approach that&#x27;s better given the time constraints for an interview (and I&#x27;ve been interviewing ppl for 20+ years).<p>The hard part is coming up with what programming problem to ask a candidate that&#x27;s fair to the candidate yet provides insight into their capability. For us, I created a simple data structure problem that hits a smattering of things that are taught in a typical undergrad CS curriculum (trees, recursion, etc). The candidate has about 30min to write the code for this in their preferred language using a plain text editor. I care less about perfect syntax when working with libraries, etc. and more about whether the candidate can take a problem statement and turn it into working code.<p>For an on-site interview, I send the candidate a description (along with screenshots) of a small web app project that hits some UI, some DB, some business layer. I encourage them to innovate around my description and surprise me. They get a couple of days to implement, then show up with their laptop and demo it. I want to see working software, then a deep dive into their code.<p>Typically by the end of the on-site interview, we have a really good idea whether this person knows their trade or not.

7700557,comment,7699659,7699659,9,0,cpprototypes,,,"The primary issue with the current technical interview style is this:<p><pre><code>  No one likes working on a problem with someone watching them constantly.\n</code></pre>\nMost companies are underestimating the power of social presence.  Just knowing that someone is watching you makes a huge difference.  Imagine there are two people taking a high pressure test like the SAT.  In one version, it&#x27;s the normal setup, a room with a desk and silence.  In another, there is someone constantly watching your paper and everything you do.  Put yourself in that position and it&#x27;s obvious that the second situation is much more stressful.<p>The effect is not limited to physical presence, it can also happen over a phone interview with screensharing.  Consider all these thoughts that a candidate is probably thinking while trying to solve the problem:<p>What&#x27;s this person thinking? Am I working too slowly? Should I type code faster?\n Is this solution what he/she is looking for?\n Should I talk more? I&#x27;m not sure what to say, ok stop panicking, just focus on the problem.  Should I say I&#x27;m focusing on the problem?<p>The problem is not the whiteboard.  The problem is that there is someone constantly looking at the whiteboard.<p>The solution is simple and I&#x27;m surprised that I&#x27;ve never seen a company try it.<p>Give the candidate a big whiteboard or a laptop with no network connection.  Give a problem and leave the room.\n Come back later.  When depends on the size and scale of the problem.\n Put the code on a projector and get other engineers in the room.\n Now discuss the code.  Run the code through some sample data. Make some criticisms and see how the candidate defends their decisions. It&#x27;s like a long code review session.\n Digressions are ok.  Maybe talking some data persistence will lead to a discussion about caching.  Maybe asking why the candidate did something will lead to talking about concurrency.<p>A bad candidate can&#x27;t BS through this.  They wrote the code, they have to either explain or defend it.  And the way they talk about things also gives a chance to show their level of experience.  The way a junior dev talks and a senior dev talks is very different.<p>The key thing is, let the candidate have some time alone to work.  Stop pressuring them with having an engineer there constantly.  The engineer doesn&#x27;t like it because they would rather be working on something.  The candidate doesn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s stressful.  And there&#x27;s no benefit to having someone there constantly.  You don&#x27;t need to hear their thought process in real time.  You don&#x27;t need to see the iterations they went through before the final solution.  If you really want to know, you can find out all these things in the discussion session afterwards.",1399317804

Level 3 isn&#x27;t just deciding to send a bunch of traffic over Comcasts network, they are sending the data requested by Comcast customers to that network.<p>This is an important distinction, and is usually part of all of these &#x27;settlement-free&#x27; peering arrangements.  In agreeing to peer with Level 3, I am sure Comcast has an agreement that they will not send any traffic to Comcast&#x27;s network that is not actually destined for a Comcast customer.  Now, if Level 3 were sending traffic to Comcast and expecting Comcast to route, for free, that traffic to another 3rd part network, that would NOT be kosher, and Comcast could fairly ask for either money or for Level 3 to stop sending that traffic to them.<p>Level 3 is ONLY sending the traffic to Comcast that Comcast is requesting; it is THEIR customers who are creating this demand for Level 3&#x27;s customer&#x27;s content.  Comcast told their customers that for $X per month, they would get Y amount of internet bandwidth, which will in almost all cases be traffic originating from a non-Comcast network; that is just the nature of the internet.  Even though Level 3 is willing to send the data that Comcast&#x27;s customers want to the Comcast network for free (settlement free), Comcast is instead refusing to accept all the traffic that their own customers are requesting and demanding additional payment to provide the service they already sold and are paid for.",1399317524

In general, a good rule of thumb is that <i>any</i> file which is generated should have a coresponding rule to generate it, whether or not that&#x27;s a generic rule or a specefic rule. Also important, rules should only generate the file they claim to generate (IE. If a rule generates &#x27;%.c&#x27; and also happens to generate &#x27;%.d&#x27;, it definitely shouldn&#x27;t act like it only generates &#x27;%.c&#x27; - An exception can be made for temporary files, but in general if they&#x27;re not going to stick around you should remove them when the rule is run anyway, or give them a proper rule if they&#x27;re sticking around). The biggest reasons for these rules is so that your rules are honest about what they create (And this makes &#x27;make clean&#x27; much easier to implement), and the second is that at some point you&#x27;ll need that generated file somewhere else and won&#x27;t have a rule to generate it on it&#x27;s own.<p>The examples break these rules more then a couple of times. Their very last examples won&#x27;t work, because they generate the %.d file in the same rule that is only supposed to generate the %.css file. Because of this, &#x27;make&#x27; has no way of figuring out what rule to run to create the %.d file, so the -include will fail from the .d files not existing in the first run (-include and include-file generation happen before the default rule is started, because it happens at parsing time). Providing a separate %.d rule would fix this issue (And also fix the issue that every time you compile your dependency info will be generated again, even if it hasn&#x27;t changed.). For example, if you wrote a &#x27;make clean&#x27; which only cleaned the %.css files, all of the %.d files would be generated again when you generate the %.css files, even though it&#x27;s not nessisary. There&#x27;s also a small error that &#x27;all&#x27; isn&#x27;t the default rule to run, the default is simply the first rule in the file. It&#x27;s common to see &#x27;all&#x27; defined high-up in a Makefile as something like &#x27;all: real-all&#x27;, where &#x27;real-all&#x27; is defined below after other various things take place, and it does the actual heavy lifting of kicking off the compilation.",1399317417

7700525,comment,7697955,7698383,4,0,aaronem,,,"Put another way, Ruby is a Lisp implemented by someone who doesn&#x27;t understand what makes a Lisp worthwhile.<p>* Start with Emacs Lisp [1]: Well, if you like, but in exchange for the perceived simplicity as compared with e.g. ANSI Common Lisp, you&#x27;re also giving up extremely useful things like lexical scope, and that&#x27;s going to hurt your users down the road.<p>* Remove macros and s-exprs: Why? They&#x27;re a powerful feature, and if you&#x27;re building a Lisp, then operating on the AST shouldn&#x27;t be hard. Except that removing s-expressions costs you homoiconicity, which means you need to translate from source to AST, which means the difficulty of writing a macro just jumped by several orders of magnitude, so, fair enough, if you&#x27;re throwing out s-exprs then macros have to go as well. I can see an argument for this decision, in that it lowers the barrier to entry for non-Lispers who have yet to get over the parentheses allergy.<p>* Add simple object system: Is it really that much simpler to do single inheritance + mixins (Ruby) than to do multiple inheritance (CLOS)? This is an honest question; I&#x27;ve never implemented an object system, so I don&#x27;t know which is easier from the developer&#x27;s perspective. From the perspective of the language user, though, I don&#x27;t know that I see a lot of difference.<p>* add blocks: This decision strikes me as totally indefensible.<p>If you already have lambdas, why do you need this separate abstraction which looks and smells mostly like a lambda, but doesn&#x27;t act like one except in certain circumstances, and which is also the only place in your entire language with lexical scope rather than dynamic? You&#x27;ve just unforgivably complicated your language&#x27;s syntax and implementation, and your users&#x27; lives; you&#x27;ve made it necessary for people both to write, and to understand, documents like [2]. Why would you ever do that?<p>And if you don&#x27;t already have lambdas, in what crazy world of paisley skies and ice-cream seas does it make any kind of sense to put yourself and your users through all these unnecessary mental calisthenics, when you can just add lambdas, and solve all these problems with a single simple abstraction that everyone either already knows or should?<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone could possibly defend this reeking farrago, but I&#x27;d sure like to see someone try.<p>* add methods found in Smalltalk: I&#x27;ll concede this one; it was a good idea, and a lot of Ruby&#x27;s power comes from being able to hang magic off method_missing. Of course, a lot of Ruby&#x27;s <i>headaches</i> come from that, too, and it is a persistent source of subtle bugs and unexpected behaviors, especially in frameworks like Rails which make heavy use of such magic hooks. For Smalltalk developers, this isn&#x27;t so much of a problem, because Smalltalk is so heavily self-documenting; Ruby developers are not so fortunate.<p>* add Perl functionality: Well, this makes sense, if you&#x27;re trying to come up with a Perl killer, in the same way that Perl was explicitly intended to be an awk and sed killer. It seems lately to be working, too; there&#x27;s what looks to be an increasing trend for people to use Ruby for the sort of tooling which, a decade ago, they would&#x27;ve done in Perl. On the other hand, and I say this as someone who grew up with Perl and will always have a soft spot for it, Perl is a giant ball of hair laced with fish hooks, into which only a true expert may plunge his hands and pull them back out without severe lacerations. If you let your Perl emulation anywhere near the conceptual or implementation core of your language, you risk infecting it with the same disease -- indeed, I&#x27;m inclined to wonder if that&#x27;s whence came the brain damage that led to Ruby&#x27;s mess of mutant lambdas.<p>Don&#x27;t mistake me: Ruby is a cute, useful little language, and it has some interesting ideas which I think are worthy of wider consideration, such as the method system. Unfortunately, Ruby <i>also</i> has some grave drawbacks, such as the lack of a self-documenting capability to make the method system sane to use at scale, which in my opinion rather severely reduce its appeal.<p>[1]: No, I&#x27;ve never seen Matsumoto admit outright that he started with Emacs Lisp, but I think it&#x27;s a reasonable surmise. Consider: Emacs Lisp descends from MacLisp, which is both simpler and older than Common Lisp; in both Emacs Lisp and Ruby, lexical scope is an afterthought, inflicting at least occasional headaches on users of both languages; prior to inventing Ruby, Matsumoto was an Emacs Lisp developer of considerable Japanese repute.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://awaxman11.github.io/blog/2013/08/05/what-is-the-difference-between-a-block/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://awaxman11.github.io/blog/2013/08/05/what-is-the-diffe...</a>",1399317401

I assumed that HN readers have a higher probability than the general population to associate words with scientific or engineering meanings.  I further assumed that as this site has a high association with electronics, the electrical meaning of conductor would be most prevalent.  This was reinforced by the parent post, who stated nearly exactly what I had been thinking, right down to the smirking overcleverness with which it described to motion of elecromagnetic charge.  Before clicking on the link, I thought of other things that could be meant by &quot;conductor&quot;.  I came up with heat transfer and train tickets.  I didn&#x27;t even think of orchestras, probably because I had always been in bands, where the leaders were overwhelmingly <i>directors</i>, <i>band leaders</i>, and <i>drum majors</i>.<p>The second element of the joke is that I presumed that HN readers, having a variety of esoteric hobbies, might also have an interest in cognitive science and linguistics (particularly the AI folks), and might want to analyze the brain of an outlier.  I then decided that, while less accessible to a home hobbyist than brain surgery or in-depth psychological profiling, fMRI imaging conveyed the point of the joke in shorter, more recognizable wording, without actually being a very probable outcome.<p>In reality, you would probably be wired up to a home-made sensor array and presented with a series of time-indexed sensory inputs via headphones and a computer screen, and perhaps asked to press certain button sequences in response.<p>So, in short, no, those people do not need a fMRI.

7700451,comment,7696808,7697049,1,0,pdonis,,,"Are you sure you understand what happens to the cash that the trust fund gives to the Treasury in exchange for the US Treasuries it purchases? The US government <i>spends</i> that cash. That means that, when the trust fund needs to sell US Treasuries back to the US government to make payments, the US government has to get the cash from current funds, i.e., from current taxpayers, <i>over and above</i> what current taxpayers are <i>already paying in</i> to Social Security, or by printing new money. (For quite some time now, it has been doing more of the latter than the former.) This also shows, btw, that US Treasuries are not &quot;securities&quot; in the usual sense of the term, because the cash obtained by the seller (the US government) is not used to finance investments; it&#x27;s used to pay current expenses.<p>The above is <i>not</i> how a standard pension fund works. A standard pension fund has to be able to make current payments from the earnings it has collected on past payments. That is originally how Social Security was supposed to work, but it is very, very far from working that way now and has been for a long time.<p>And yes, of course standard pension funds invest payments coming in in a portfolio of securities; but if the fund is having to sell securities outright (i.e., prior to maturity) to make current payments, instead of just making payments from the earnings on those securities, it has a big problem. Which is exactly the problem Social Security has; except that, because the US government is a sovereign government and can print money and lie about its accounting, it has been able to obfuscate what is going on.",1399316708

I also think you are thinking of Matt Mullenweg in the same light as many other startup founders, but he is quite different, especially in regard to his commitment to open source and publicly stated desire for Automattic to be a very long-term company, not reach a high valuation and have a big sale.<p>Now to your notes:<p>First, they don&#x27;t have 20 sales people for VIP. They have less than ten for sure. Probably closer to five.<p>Second, VIP has more than a 100 customers, by far. And VIP business has grown ever since it was introduced, but simultaneously has become a smaller and smaller part of their overall revenues (I know this to be true). Which means other aspects of their business are growing faster than VIP.<p>I&#x27;ve followed Automattic closely for a long time. I don&#x27;t at all see them as the type of company to just grab money in frothy markets. I think we&#x27;ll see this money equip them to make some much bigger investments in the next couple years.

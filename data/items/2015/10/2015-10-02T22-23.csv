You only need to go across the strait to see an example of quick but bloodless regime change. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Taiwan was an authoritarian one-party state under martial law. But from the late 70s on, the Taiwanese government steadily introduced reforms until it head its first direct presidential election in 1996. Today, Taiwan is a multi-party democracy with a stable economy. Certainly, it has its fair share of problems (there&#x27;s been a lot of corruption scandals), but it&#x27;s definitely come a long way.",1443826788

He takes the easy way out of blaming her, even though his friend Fitzgerald was quick to tell him &quot;Be rid of her.&quot;, advice he disregarded and even rebutted. Granted, she was obnoxiously aggressive. But when he really was tired of her, he divorced her as well. So when he really wanted to be rid of her, he was. It is a matter of convenience to pin the blame all on her during the time when he didn&#x27;t really want to be rid of her.<p>It can be really hard to say whether it was a good thing he got his needs met through her or a bad thing. I mean, it can be a hard judgement call even if you are one of the people involved in such a situation. Outsiders generally have no real idea what is going on behind closed doors. A report like this, long after his death, really hard to judge. People will tend to judge based on their own prejudices, in essence.",1443826744

I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands and from a young age I&#x27;d walk/bike everywhere (sports training, friends&#x27; places, etc.). When everything is close by, it&#x27;s easy for parents to gradually give children more space and responsibilities. For example, at a very young age I was only allowed to walk/bike to the end of the street. Then, later, I started walking to school. Then, later still, I&#x27;d bike to my grandparents in the neighboring town and so on to taking public transport to the city to go to secondary school.

We then take a page from the Affordable Care Act and require at least 85-90% of tuition funds to go to actual teaching, and not administration, leisure activities/clubs, and other non-core expenses.<p>> And then to seemingly do this by &quot;just taxing the rich&quot;?

Simply &quot;stop funding the military&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;easy&quot; - and I doubt it is something that can be done over a 4 year term. Most of the military&#x27;s budget are salaries, not just soldiers but likely millions of factory workers who produce a wide range of products for the military. While the question of &quot;are the products they produce useful&quot; is grey, the fact is you&#x27;d have to start by laying off millions of Americans and likely damaging the many smaller towns that have come to depend that income source. While its simple to just state &quot;defund the military&quot; the truth is much more complex and likely an even greater political minefield. If he does win the election, if he were to pull off that move, I doubt he would have the political strength to keep a trajectory going for a second election.<p>As much as I believe that free education should be a thing, I believe that is also a minefield.

Even El Niño phenomena can be spotted.<p>Local radar doesn&#x27;t give condition more than about 100 miles off-shore.

10321669,comment,10319138,10321325,0,0,abdullahkhalids,,,"You are essentially correct in the third paragraph. Let me elucidate and be more correct. Bear with me.<p>We have found four field theories (electromagnetism, weak theory, strong theory, gravitation)[1]. Each of theories have a domain of applicability in which, in principle, all the results of all experiments can be predicted using that one theory. Domain of applicability includes length scale, time scale, energies involved etc. This is not a satisfying situation because it is extremely common for systems to not respect this human-imposed domain. Therefore, we want a single theory whose domain is the union of the domains of all of these theories. Call this goal the goal of unification. This has been partly been achieved (electroweak theory), and work continues.<p>Then there is another goal. To find a theory that has a even larger domain of applicability than before. This is the problem of scale. The article claims that the problem of scale is never ending because finite experimental data (and philosophical claims not discussed in the article). String theory is an attempt at the unification goal but it comes with a larger domain of applicability as a bonus. I think this makes the two separate issues discussed in the article clear.<p>I make a third point that you asked about. I make the following observations. General relativity under reasonable restrictions reduces to Newton&#x27;s law of gravity. The correspondence principle claims that quantum mechanics (typically) reduces to classical mechanics if your system has a large number of particles. Special relativity reduces to classical mechanics for low speeds. These are three pairs of micro-macro theories. In all of these cases the micro theory also works at the scale of the macro theory if you choose to use it: In other words the domain of applicability of the macro theory is a strict subset of the domain of applicability of the micro theory.<p>This subset business does not work so nicely for field theories. Or when looking at general relativity and quantum theories at the same time. There are overlapping domains but no nice strict subset. In that case there is not simple notion of micro-macro theory. However, returning to your original question you can sometimes use multiple theories at the same time to make predictions. Eg. particle physics experiments at CERN do this (multiple field theories), or that blackhole physics that keeps making headlines (quantum and gravity). This situation is of course far from satisfactory and work towards the goal of unification continues.<p>[1] All of these theories of fields assume quantum mechanics which is a theory of particles. Our universe is made up of particles and fields, as far as we know.",1443824147

Frankly, I rarely give them much thought. $60/month for (I think) 35Mbps up and down. Every single time I&#x27;ve actually checked it, it was indeed what they claim, and it rarely goes down. (About once every couple of months it&#x27;ll go down for an hour almost exactly at 2300 or midnight; I assume some kind of maintenance.) I don&#x27;t have to call them once a year to keep the same rate; bill shows up, I pay it, they keep giving me solid, no-bullshit service. Of the few times I&#x27;ve called for support, it&#x27;s been a small wait and they quickly fixed the problem. My feelings about Frontier are about the same as I have toward the city water utility: I turn on the &quot;tap&quot; and internet comes out, I pay the bill on time every month, and rarely do I give it another thought. That might sound like damning with faint praise, but I think it&#x27;s the highest praise possible.<p>Contrast to Comcast, my old provider. Fluctuating rates, horrendous customer service, advertised speeds that are nowhere near reality (I had 12Mbps package back in the day; it rarely was good for more than 3Mbps), and as reliable as an old Fiat. Oh, unlike the city water utility, do I have feelings about Comcast. The last time they were at my door I told the salesman I&#x27;d do without internet before I&#x27;d give another dime to them. Ironically, Comcast were the ones running billboards about how horrible Frontier would be when Verizon gave up on fiber and sold it to Frontier. Yeah, well, I&#x27;ve been a Comcast customer and I don&#x27;t see how it could possibly be any worse. Turns out Frontier is just fine.<p>But you&#x27;re not going to get Frontier unless you live in western Washington outside of Seattle, so this probably isn&#x27;t much help.",1443823625

The whole point is that for many (perhaps most) problems, the proportion of hard instances gets vanishingly small, and yet those are the ones that we often need to solve. Showing a sub-exponential trend for randomly chosen instances, or worse, instances he&#x27;s chosen to show you, is no evidence at all.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say exactly nothing. If no one can present an algorithm than can do at least as good on the same instances...that&#x27;s interesting.<p>He did not choose the instances. They were generated using multiple calls to a built-in pseudo-random function. The instances were generated when he requested an instance and the timer started when the instances were transmitted to him. The timer was stopped when a response was received and the response was then verified. He never submitted an incorrect answer.<p>[Aside: There is a particular web page of a university professor that lists a smallish subset sum problem and claims that the naive algorithm would take some 10^large_number years to find the answer. His algorithm solves that particular instance in some very short period of time (seconds or less I believe). Is that particular instance &quot;hard&quot;? I don&#x27;t know. Apparently not.<p>He likes to use that instance as an example of his algorithm solving a &quot;hard&quot; problem. My problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to verify if an instance is hard (or if such an analysis is even possible/valid). My instincts say that it very much depends on the &quot;density of solutions&quot; in the particular instance. Maybe that instance has lots of solutions and so a random walk will easily find one? On the other hand, maybe there is a limit to the number of solutions that can exist in a well-formed instance?]<p>While I do not understand his entire proof (and I do believe he has intentionally withheld a portion of the proof [and certainly a key piece of the algorithm (if it exists)]), he does point to some interesting things (such as an apparent fractal pattern in the sum of all sets in the powerset of a set of integers). He claims a function that provides an ordering over the sums of the sets in the powerset, which can apparently be computed on-demand in polynomial time of the original set. A binary search is then applied over the ordering.<p>In my own theory, it seems like it could be possible; after all, there isn&#x27;t an exponential number of items, only combinations.<p>>The whole point<p>Sorry, the whole point of what?

At the level of a single step: if you have two pixels A and B that are both 8-bit numbers, then if you want some lossless way to store both (A+B)/2 (an 8-bit number) and enough information to restore both A and B, it will take at least one extra bit (9 bits, e.g. to store B and the least significant bit of A+B). So a 24-bit RGB image would become a 27-bit images when interlaced with better resampling (except for the very first pixel, which would need only 24 bits).<p>In practice, the simplistic resampling is not likely to be an issue -- of course you can create a malicious image which is white on the even rows and black on the odd rows, and then all previews would be black while they should be grey. But most of the actual images are not like that -- e.g. photographs. You can just decode at somewhat higher resolution and scale down from that. (You have to start from a power-of-two scaled image anyway.)
Also note that Y is emitted at more detail earlier than chroma, so most of the error will be in those less important chroma channels. Other than that it&#x27;s just Adam7 interlacing, but with no upper bound on the number of passes (so you could call it Adam-infinity interlacing).",1443823204

The spike of TC50 MIGHT just push a service like that into having a self-sustaining/growing user population.  Example: What Twitter experienced at SXSW.<p>And for anything inherantly, viral-- an event like this is a big bump...  It's compound interest with a larger initial principal.  If you have a viral service that starts with 2 users and I have a viral service that starts with the 10k I'll get at TC50 and we both have the same viral co-efficient, who wins?<p>And for any company that is fundraising, the visibility/credibility provided by this event is HUGE.<p>And for any company that is actively looking for partners/bizdev deals, the visibility/credibility provided by this event is big.<p>Is the value big enough to be worth shifting your launch date dramatically?

298607,comment,298260,298580,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Your first assumption is incorrect. I never said they were chosen randomly, and specifically mentioned researching those 100 stocks. Since I did not say that the stocks were random, and also said that they were not random, I am not sure where you got that idea.<p>It seems fairly unlikely to me that there is no value to research. The average person's research may have low marginal value, but I cannot help but notice that some folks are able to research a company, articulate why it's a good company to invest in, and be right. It would be kind of funny if stocks were the only financial transaction in which doing less research was an advantage. Of course, for pecuniary reasons I won't discourage you from investing on that assumption.<p>The average hedge fund is not necessarily trying to outperform the market. Many of them are looking for higher risk-adjusted returns (i.e. being up when the market is up, and up less when the market is down). And to some extent the low future returns of hedge funds can be blamed on outside investors: a fund with a good record can scale up tenfold within a year once investors start chasing them -- that hurts returns, but their fees can convince managers to take on the extra money anyway.<p>Finally, the hedge fund comparison is silly because you (probably) don't pay a 2 and 20 on your own personally selected investments. If you do, I would suggest switching brokers. Since Buffett's bet is at least partially a bet that the high returns don't justify such high fees, you might pay attention to the gross returns rather than the net returns.",1220897959

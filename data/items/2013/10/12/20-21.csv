If Google is going to go for this kind of patent, then it would be good to see a firmer (and much larger) commitment to something like their &quot;Open Patent Non-Assertion Pledge&quot;[1].<p>I&#x27;d breathe easier about these crap patents if I knew they were functioning only as land mines for bad parties out there. Of course, they shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place and real patent trolls have nothing to worry about, since they produce nothing that you can countersue over in the first place...but the EFF is right that this is the right thing to do in this case. skore brings up a good point below[2] that it&#x27;s not really about fairness. Google is a company that prides itself on being better than using &quot;vague, overbroad&quot; patents, so best to use that as leverage to make sure a big presence in the industry continues as a good(ish) actor and use that as a fixed point for continued change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/google-adds-79-patents-to-patent-non-aggression-pact/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/google-adds-79-pa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6539746"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6539746</a>",1381611475

6540265,comment,6539572,6539572,8,0,goggles99,,,"The comparisons drawn in this article are far from accurate. Comparing the Xbox taking off vs the ps2 is a far different comparison than of Windows vs Linux. If we are talking in terms of gaming by itself, it still is a bad comparison. The Xbox and PS3 had a comparable quantity and quality of games at the point when Halo was released. The buyer was already making a choice between two fairly closely matched (in terms of cost, available games, and features such as online experience ETC.) machines. One game MAY have been able to persuade them to purchase one system or the other, but this is a far different situation.<p>Windows has 20x (probably more) good games than linux, is as stable, comes already loaded on almost every machine you buy, has a far larger choice of other apps, Everyone is used to the windows experience (although win 8 changes that), and maybe most importantly - it has a user base that is 20x that of desktop Linux (you won&#x27;t be able to play most of your friends in a Linux exclusive game today).<p>The claim in this article may be true someday, but today is not that day.

Your code does not typically write to your code.<p>It&#x27;s a lot more reasonable that an attacker manages to convince your code to write some malicious data, than it is that an attacker has full write access to your filesystem.<p>As an analogy: your SQL database probably writes to a filesystem somewhere.

But, say, SQL injection attacks are still infinitely more common than &quot;can write to the source file currently being executed&quot;.<p>Or, to rephrase: being writable (by the user executing app code) is a default state for your data store.

Educating the young generation is an investment in the future that brings more sophisticated work and higher wage jobs. Very Simple.<p>In Bangladesh underemployment among healthy adults is so widespread that child labor can only be ascribed to bad governance. Clearly the government, if it cared about future growth and wealth in the country, should create a scheme allowing children to learn and healthy adults to work.<p>Simply banning child labor is not enough as this story so clearly explains. The family needs the money, and doesn&#x27;t have idle healthy adults who could could replace meem&#x27;s income. Some fairly sophisticated scheme is required for this to work.

Suggested Sites is explicitly opt-in and IIRC (can&#x27;t verify, on a Mac), the toolbar installer defaults the checkboxes to opt-in but presents a screen to opt-out during installation.

6540115,comment,6534452,6537163,1,0,danneu,,,"The difference is that Rails and the popular gems involve some of the highest abstractions I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s like that by design. There&#x27;s nothing inherently bad about it.<p>Here&#x27;s the typical workflow for adding a gem:<p><pre><code>    1. Add &quot;gem &#x27;some_library&#x27;&quot; to Gemfile\n    2. `bundle install`\n    3. Drop the &#x27;some_library_method!&#x27; incantation where you need to.\n</code></pre>\nHere are the steps for Devise&#x27;s base-case (I only use Devise as an example for a broader point):<p><pre><code>    1. echo &#x27;gem &quot;devise&quot;&#x27; >> Gemfile\n    2. `rails generate devise:install`\n    3. `rails generate devise User`\n    4. `rails generate devise:views`\n</code></pre>\nBoom. It&#x27;s awesome.<p>The trade-off is that now your entire authentication system is hidden behind line 37 of your Gemfile. And that&#x27;s Devise&#x27;s purpose - to be that abstract. And on many projects that&#x27;s perfectly fine.<p>Of course, you can roll your own authentication in Rails. It&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s not like you have to use Devise or a daisy-chain of opaque libraries.<p>But I find it nontrivial to understand what Rails does behind the scenes. Or what `require &quot;activerecord&quot;` in Sinatra does behind the scenes. Or how to recreate a state of my application. Or how to test things without a testing abstraction. And I didn&#x27;t really care until I started to care.<p>Ring&#x27;s functional abstraction has helped me remain aware of what my application is doing. My application state is annotated clearly as `(def ^:dynamic <i>current-user</i>)` which is bound to every request by plucking the value of the `:session` key out of the request map. My application is now a function that&#x27;s applied to a map.<p><pre><code>     (app {:uri &quot;http://localhost&quot;, :port 3000, :body ...})\n</code></pre>\nWhere `app` is just a var that&#x27;s bound in my source code:<p><pre><code>    (def app \n      (-> my-routes\n          middleware1\n          middleware2\n          middleware3))\n</code></pre>\nEach of those just a function that&#x27;s trivial to understand. Trivial to modify. Pure or trivial to mock pure if I need to mock its components.<p><pre><code>    > So, in the end, do you get all the feature of Devise back with Clojure (and\n    > its library, of course). Do you have to reimplement CSRF correctly yourself?\n</code></pre>\nOver the course of a software project, interacting with existing code and getting existing code to interact with other code dominates more and more of your day-to-day.<p>In other words, `devise install full-stack-authentication-system` optimizes for the only easy part of software: greenfielding it in the first place.<p>It buffers you from having to understand it. In fact, the mantra is that you&#x27;re supposedly stamping out the specter of NIH and deferring the hard stuff to smarter people. But too often I find that the fear of NIH is bolstered as some unconditional ostensible virtue used to justify a system that&#x27;s hard to tweak because so much of it is hidden away. Or worse yet, it enables you to be wildly productive without ever having to know what CSRF even is. Or it lets you assume that authentication, CSRF protection, and password encryption are all significantly hard problems that you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to underestand.<p>Yehuda Katz presents a talk at Railsberry 2012 entitled &quot;Why Rails Is Hard.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ex8EEv-WPs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ex8EEv-WPs</a><p>He explains that you don&#x27;t need to worry about things like CSRF protection because the entire concern is abstracted into the ApplicationController method `protect_from_forgery`.<p>And his key assertion is that an application framework&#x27;s security shouldn&#x27;t be deferred to the end-user (the developer). It shouldn&#x27;t be opt-in for the few that run the gauntlet of reading the documentation. People don&#x27;t dive into your documentation. I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m all about that `## Usage` heading in your Github project&#x27;s README. Once you give me the incantation to install and require a library, I bounce.<p>He says that he doesn&#x27;t want to worry about the order of anti-forgery middleware every time he&#x27;s cranking out an application.<p>I generally agree with him. I think Rails should provide those abstractions.<p>However, I went a comically long time without caring what `protect_from_forgery` was. Or what CSRF was. Or what a password salt was. They were probably sophisticated things.<p>And by not caring, I indeed was able to focus on software and getting better at building applications and learning how to code. CSRF is an acronym I certainly can defer to a future date or Yehuda Katz when I&#x27;m still learning how to even get a datastore, an authentication system, an authorization system, a user system, a forum system to all intermingle from the highest level.<p>But more importantly, I went a long time without even knowing enough to implement these things myself.<p>I didn&#x27;t know that `GET /logout` was a bad idea. Or that someone could make their forum avatar into `<img src=&quot;/logout&quot;>` and log out every single person that viewed it. Or that CSRF protection doesn&#x27;t protect that.<p>Sheepishly, it wasn&#x27;t until relatively recently that I started to learn these things. And I&#x27;m fortunate that I have a lot of time to learn them. I&#x27;m 25 with no wife or children but with the freetime to begin learning from scratch all the things I&#x27;ve deferred for so long. Not everyone has that. That&#x27;s why all of the above is a personal expression that I should&#x27;ve told from the first person.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m some sort of transcendental security wizard because I finally know what the `__anti_forgery_token` is. Or because I could google &quot;github ring csrf protection&quot; and find a Clojure library and add it to my dependencies. But I have finally started to understand how my software works. And I&#x27;ve discovered that things like password encryption and CSRF protection aren&#x27;t exactly mystifying. And I can read some simple functional Clojure source-code that makes is obvious to me because I can replicate it in the repl.<p>Yehuda Katz is right in that I probably wont know about the next CSRF edge-case exploit as it&#x27;s known. Nor will I notice that my ring.util.wrap-anti-forgery dependency was updated and I need to bump the version. Nor will you see an impenetrable fortress if you visit that repo I linked in my last post. It&#x27;s far from that and far from complete.<p>But it&#x27;s an iterative learning process, and Ring&#x27;s simple functional abstraction and the a la carte nature of Clojure libraries and how simple they are to glue together due to their reluctance to mutate state helped make it trivial for me to see how things fit together from a slightly less concealing abstraction.<p>As I work on my app, I&#x27;d like to work towards my own web-stack template that&#x27;s robust and transparent for me to understand. And for all I know, I&#x27;m probably not much different than DHH hacking on Ruby pre-Rails or any other person that&#x27;s ever cobbled together their own abstraction. Maybe in half a year I&#x27;ll have just arrived at Clojure on Clails. I just feel late to the party.<p>(I didn&#x27;t mean to focus so much on security, but this applies to the whole surface area of abstractions that might do too much. Like <a href=""https://github.com/bernat/best_in_place"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bernat/best_in_place</a>, a library that handles inplace-editing and even the Ajax request that saves it.

They were able to appropriate what came before them mostly for free, and operate in an environment of relative legal calm.

Well fuck you, I&#x27;ll rollback the network drivers you installed.<p>- What&#x27;s that, you&#x27;re trying to watch more than 5 youtube videos in a row? Fuck you, Compiz has crashed!<p>- While you were sleeping last night, I threw away all the stuff that you had on your desktop. Also, you can&#x27;t right click on it anymore. What&#x27;s that, did you right click more than 5 times in anger? Fuck you, Unity has crashed!<p>- You&#x27;re trying to search the web for solutions to all these crashes? Fuck you, Compiz has crashed! Also, your mouse and keyboard don&#x27;t work anymore. Have fun rebooting by holding your power button.<p>- What&#x27;s that, you didn&#x27;t pay attention to me for more than 5 minutes and I went to sleep? Well I&#x27;ll just replace your screen with gibberish.<p>- What&#x27;s that, you want to step out without people replacing your desktop background? Well I&#x27;ll just hide this password prompt and show you a nice picture of your desktop background instead.<p>- What&#x27;s that, you&#x27;re trying to listen to music? Don&#x27;t you just miss the old days when the cd would skip on a regular basis? I sure do! Besides, I don&#x27;t like your music so as a bonus, Compiz has crashed!<p>- What&#x27;s that, you&#x27;re in a dark environment and you want to reduce the brightness? Well fuck you, everything has crashed. But here, I&#x27;ll just run this awesome flashlight app that maximizes your brightness.

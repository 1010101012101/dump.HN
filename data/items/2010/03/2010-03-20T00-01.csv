We’ve had the gem out for nearly two months now without any show stopper issues forcing an update, so I’m pretty confident with it’s stability.<p>Thanks again to the many people who contributed code to SproutCore 1.0.  You’ve built something you should be very proud of.<p>This project was in the works for 18 months.  We rewrote 20,000 lines of code, added nearly 6,000 unit tests, and significantly improved the clarity and consistency of the API.<p>Most importantly, SproutCore 1.0 is a performance beast.  It feels really good to be able to recommend SproutCore to people building complex app that will push the boundaries of the browser knowing that we have the goods to get them there.<p>If you’ve been holding off on SproutCore 1.0 until it was really really done - well it’s ready so come and get it!<p>Now What?<p>Ironically, most of the core SproutCore team has moved well along past the 1.0 candidate.  A lot of work is already going into the next release with some really fantastic results.  So must so that I will spend most of my talk at jsconf in April covering the new stuff instead of 1.0.<p>The good news is that 1.5 (or whatever it’s called) will be a much shorter release cycle - probably starting this summer.  And this time a lot of the development is happening in the community so it is a lot easier for everyone to get involved.<p>I’ll save some of the big surprises for jsconf but suffice to say the next few versions of SproutCore will be major moves forward.  1.0 was about laying the ground work for some big things down the road.  These next few releases we start to reap those rewards.<p>See you at jsconf.",1269046776

For example, there has been concern expressed recently in the UK (where there are minimum wage laws) that describing something as an internship is being used as an attempt to circumvent those laws. If the BBC News story was even close to accurate, then the view from just about everyone who matters (government, trade unions, etc.) was that this is just a con and won't stand up if challenged, and that organisations found to be abusing the idea of internships would be removed from government programmes.",1269046428

I'm always careful about which API calls I use. The iPhone simulator has always worked very well for me, so I'm guessing the iPad simulator is also going to be good to me as well.<p>I'm still not convinced that they are going to let absolutely everybody in on the first day.

I look at the unhappy millionaire and think that he must have problems that are a major burden on him. It doesn't matter what those problems are or what we as outsiders think of those problems; it's the fact that he's not able to overcome these problems that make him unhappy. The money is irrelevant, unless of course it is the source of his problems. On the other hand, I look at the happy poor guy and think that any problems he has are just not a burden on him. It's not that money doesn't really matter to him; it's that lack of money doesn't put a major burden on him.<p>I don't think we have a natural setting, I think we all treat difficulties in different ways and sometimes can't deal with the burden, no matter how good the other things in our life may be (including but not limited to having money).",1269045622

By my definition, atheism is a belief construct and falls into the subcategory under philosophy as a 'religion.' This is a pretty unpopular assertion, so I don't make it often, but it helps for clarification. To wit, legal constructs should be as abstracted from a single belief system as functionally possible, since beliefs vary so widely from one individual to the next. And because any legal system based on ideology is fraught with bugs. The description of a ship with no captain, in Plato's Republic, describes this in a way that is still disturbingly applicable to our modern political and social dynamic.<p>A more simple way of putting it would be, ""if you believe marriage has meaning, then it has meaning.""

1205680,comment,1205300,1205300,0,0,fnid2,,,"While reading all the examples of arguments he <i>wasn't</i> going to make, I was really expecting something new to be added to the debate, instead, he recycles this argument:<p><pre><code>  it is not reasonable to expect that the current patent
  system, nor even one designed to improve or replace it,
  will ever be able to accurately determine what might be 
  considered legitimately patentable from the overwhelming 
  volume of innovations in software.
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, he's wrong -- again -- and has failed to convince me that discrimination against software engineers is the solution to the software patent problems.<p>The simple solution would be to charge more for software patents and use the money to hire more people.  Patents, if you aren't aware are under $1,000.  That's ridiculously cheap compared to the attorneys, writers, and engineers who invent the code.  As a comparison, attorney's in California charge about $20,000 to write a software patent.<p>For $850 (the basic filing fee) how can anyone expect the office to afford to review such patents?  Someone capable of understanding them would easily cost $100,000 a year outside the USPTO.  If it takes 10 hours to read one of the patents, then each patent would cost the USPTO $500 to review and that's not counting all the bureaucrats involved.<p>The answer is, the USPTO cannot afford to review software patents. Plain and simple.  Instead, they just stamp ""Approved"" on them and let the litigators argue it out in the courts -- adding more millions to the cost, which of course go straight into the attorneys' pockets.  If there is anything stifling innovation, it's the <i>attorneys</i>, not the patents.<p>My suggestion:  Raise the basic filing fee from $850 to $8,500 or $85,000  Or 0.01% of filer revenue for the previous year.<p>Obviously we have a supply and demand problem.  The price is simply too low.  Solution: raise the price. Use the additional revenue to hire more software engineers who can better judge the validity of the claims.",1269045061

True, the classic opera (say, late baroque through Puccini) was written specifically for the <i>bel canto</i> voice due to the increased size of the audience over the previous, more intimate pieces, the unfortunate lack of amplification, and the relatively few vowels to be found in Italian (and French, for that matter) but there's no real reason to equate a genre of theatre with any particular vocal style. Hearing a Purcell piece sung with the English-mangling roundness of vowels required for the italianate style is as disturbing to me as <i>Nixon in China</i>. Even loudness is not an excuse -- the reverberations of Ethel Merman's last ""on with the show"" have not yet died down.<p>There's no need for opera to become fossilised, nor for it to aspire to an audience of fossils. <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> should have changed the world -- not that it was the best that could have been done, but it should have opened doors everywhere to the possibility of actually keeping opera relevant.",1269044710

I was also surprised when the Intel version wouldn't run on non-Apple hardware, when they could easily have sold it for use on Dell boxes. It was explained to me that Apple is a hardware company.  They want to make a great operating system and great applications so you will buy more of their hardware.   It was the first example I saw of software selling the hardware, where generally the two were sold separately.<p>Mobile devices has always been a little different.  The hardware is very different from device to device and screen realestate is precious, so each handset has its own software.  Some might argue that the reason many mobile phones have crappy software is because the companies are hardware companies tacking on some software, but it's always been that the software and the hardware are sold together and are under heavy constraints.<p>Until recently.  Now we have much more powerful devices in our pockets and our purses.  When your ""phone"" can run a browser, email, games, and media player, you can start thinking about what other software you could run.  We have enough power and flexible inputs such that we can handle the overhead of generic software.  Suddenly there's the opportunity for phone hardware and software to become separate markets.<p>It would if it there wasn't the rise of media stores and DRM.  To have good DRM you have to own the whole device.  To sell the media producers on digital distribution you have to have DRM.<p>I think that the popularity of these media stores (ebooks, movies, music) is the largest reason why we won't have root access to our (semi-)mobile devices any time soon.<p>And that's why I think iTunes is locking me out of my tablets.",1269043200

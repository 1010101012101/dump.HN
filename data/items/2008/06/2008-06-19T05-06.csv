My friend is looking something like yours for Chess tournaments.<p>Now back to my question. how about user's own domain?<p>Do they need to set it up or it can be configured on our end?<p>Google creates such entries if you register a domain through their google app account. How can that be done?",1213854972

221586,comment,221444,221444,0,0,gizmo,,,"Yay for strongly coupled components. After all, when your pdf-reader crashes it <i>should</i> take your online banking session down with it.<p>Browsers need to go to the one-process-per-web-page model if they ever want to be taken seriously. The whole concept of multiple (possibly hostile) apps living in the same memory space is madness. If you keep finding vulnerability after vulnerability, guess what? You're doing it wrong. And with a decoupled, bare-bones approach to browsing advancements such as local inter-page communication become feasible, because the security model can be so much simpler.<p>Situation: 1 browser, N pdf-reader like plugins. Result: not only can vulnerabilities in the pdf-reader affect the browser, a vulnerability in, say, flash, can affect the pdf-reader. So every component can affect every other component. Good luck with that.",1213854509

Not any more.<p>When people say ""the browser is the new OS"" they don't really mean ""OS"", they mean ""platform"". Emacs is also a platform (though not a very popular one)<p>I believe the browser is <i>the</i> most important platform, but it still requires a real OS to run on.<p>Also, his rant kind of reminded me of this: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/378/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/378/</a>",1213854211

The consequence of which is that newer negative stories are <i>less hot</i> than older negative stories. Also, the gap between positive 1 and negative 1 on reddit is HUGE hotness-wise.",1213854166

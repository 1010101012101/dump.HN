Getting from there at the purity needed for chip production is energy intensive. From the same text: ""Energy consumption for the Siemens process is ~200 kilowatt hours/kilogram of silicon produced""<p>Even correcting for a potential bias of the author (who has his own patented process that he claims to be more efficient and, I guess, that he wants to sell), I conclude that, per kg, production of silicon-grade silicon is way more energy expensive than production of aluminum.<p>On the other hand, <a href=""http://www.rsi-silicon.com/media/SolarGradeSilicon_050611.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rsi-silicon.com/media/SolarGradeSilicon_050611.pd...</a> seems to indicate that chip-quality silicon is overkill for solar cells. A dedicated factory for solar cell silicon would be more energy efficient than what exists now.",1344768985

I'm an Indie Game developer as well and I'm sure building a quality game (read as 'not-a-rip-off') will get me more hits than this guy assumes I wouldn't. Probably the app discovery is screwed up as he says, but its not as serious as he claims nor is it the end of the world, you know. Good games can market themselves (word of mouth)...and if they don't, I can still advertise on various other channels (like adwords, admob..etc) to help people 'discover' my app. The same goes for Appstore as well...Marketplace discovery is just one way, there are lots of other ways to market your apps/games...",1344768718

You can live and breathe Java all day and become a master of it and its tools and world views.<p>But the question is, should you? Should you give up the richness and flexibility of all that is out there and hedge your bets in ONE technology stack and ONE IDE?<p>Vim and Emacs and ST2 are language agnostic. The Unix command line is language agnostic. In fact, it is text editor agnostic, too. You can mix and match the tools and languages you like.<p>IDEs with all their richness are fairly confined to a very narrow set of languages and methodologies and ways of thinking about problems.<p>Both choices offer different benefits and different downsides.

Where are the restricted pointers, the flexible array member and so on?<p>And, by the way, I think the comment at the bottom of page 27 is not correct:<p><i>The qualifier const can be added to the left of a variable or parameter type to declare that the code using the variable will not change the variable. As a practical matter, use of const is very sporadic in the C programming community. It does have one very handy use, which is to clarify the role of a parameter in a function prototype...</i><p>Actually, the use of <i>const</i> is encouraged as it helps the compiler to catch more errors as well as to enable some optimizations.",1344767794

Starting with making everything except the image invisible after not moving the mouse for say, 10 seconds. Second, and while larger, better, consider using gifs instead. Up to 1920x1080, looping gifs of rainy scenes. I'll bet you could find some people to help you with that if you wanted. Let one load up, then cycle to it. I think that alone makes you look like a ""premium RainyMood"".<p>Maybe if your sound is procedurally generated, maybe adding interactive parameters like ""size of rain"" (size of field to sample), ""amount of drops"", ""location"" (city, rural, forest, lake), and then thunder variables.

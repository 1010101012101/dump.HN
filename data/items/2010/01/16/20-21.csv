I understand why ignorance of the law cannot be a defense to a crime, but ignorance of <i>fact</i> should always be. In certain situations, it may be reasonable to require that the person make a reasonable attempt to check the facts, but there's only so much a person can do.",1263675534

Couldn't find the source, but I remember it having to do with the OS X driver API and how it doesn't let you do the same kind of low-level voodoo that makes Flash work on Windows.

I don't think this is problem limited to Chicago, however.<p>I'd recommend getting to know Chicago's start-up and consulting scene, as these are probably the places with varied work and that treat people like more than cogs in a machine. Chicago has a very strong Ruby on Rails community, so it will probably help if you work in that language/platform. Places I'd recommend checking out: Among local startups, Groupon has a really talented staff and is absolutely taking off. Obtiva and Pathfinder are webapp development companies focusing on agile, rails, and RIA. Threadless is in Chicago and has a pretty large national reputation. I know people at all of the above and think any would fit your criteria. That said, Groupon seems to be in a rough stretch where developers work long hours as a result of their rapid growth; Pathfinder and Obtiva might not be hiring due to the economy and Threadless recently lost one of its founders (Jeffrey Kalmikiff) to Digg, which makes me wonder what's going on that would cause him to leave.",1263675469

Not surprisingly, she had today off, but got called in to fill in.  She called me as she got there, telling me about the seven ambulances sitting outside, knowing its going to be an ugly queue inside.<p>Some days she gets there and finds a five hour wait, which they work hard to get down to a sensible level.

1057462,comment,1057133,1057347,0,0,chipsy,,,"An idea I just had that might help civility is to require every post to ""explain itself"" with a limited set of tags. Sort of like the ./ point system in reverse; you would get some set of options like ""Information,"" ""Opinion,"" ""Related,"" ""Off-topic"" and you pick one or more. So if you want to start making a fuss or interject something outside the immediate discussion, you have to announce it.<p>Doing this adds filtering metadata and an gives additional incentive to downvote comments that don't contribute - they're going to be more likely to use few tags or inappropriate ones. On the other hand, posts that use a lot of tags simultaneously and actually encompass all of them are probably detailed and well-considered.<p>Downsides: more work to post(not always a bad thing), more room for nasty rules lawyering(""This is not Hacker News"").",1263675129

Which is the fundamental problem - chaining is not good for branches, so any branches send you back to nesting. On the higher level theproblem is that you are trying to express a tree as a list - ain't going to work.<p>Haskel side-steps this problem in a neat way - you can take advantage of delayed evaluation and give names to both arguments of the ternary expression so each individual piece looks linear. So your ""tree"" is broken down line by line:<p><pre><code>  x=...\n  y=...\n  z=f?x:y\n  </code></pre>\nwhich is as neat and easy to read as a chain, but is more powerful because it can express a tree.<p>Once could enforce this sort of reader-friendly style by forbidding expressions in ternary operators.",1263674334

The last one, about work gangs sitting around doing nothing reminds me of just about every road construction crew I've ever seen in the U.S.<p>One thing that greatly impresses me is road construction work in Shanghai.  I've seen them rebuild a street, completely rip it up, install new sewage and fiber optics at lightning speed.  This entails coordination of at least 3 different departments of the municipal government.  In contrast, there is a construction project on I-95 through the middle of Jacksonville, Florida that has been ongoing for over 20 years!!",1263672687

The reason for this is so that you can easily show one person at a VC firm, who, if excited, can easily show the rest. A working prototype is <i>the</i> litmus test for VCs, who by the nature of their trade can rarely be experts in everything.<p>If you've got the money to fast track a provisional patent, so that you can say ""We've filed a provision patent,"" it will give you major credibility, more negotiating leverage, and in particular you'll have the IP that VCs want.<p>You definitely need to open the kimono a bit. In particular it is practically unheard of that a patent lawyer will screw you -- more often they will just take your money.

Once the player has discovered those algorithms, it's impossible to continue having a fresh experience.  So ""autogenerated"" is, at best, taking hand-crafted content, repeating it a few times, and changing some details in the hope that the player won't notice the repetition right away.<p>This is, of course, only in the context of traditional RPGs - more sandbox-style games, like Dwarf Fortress, or Love (or, hell, at the other extreme of auto-generated content, Tetris) can do just fine.",1263672593

In fact, when combined with potential performance penalty that Google may apply (could be 5%, 10%, for one week, two weeks... who knows) the actual amount of damage in lost traffic/business to us could easily run into the thousands.<p>Are you going to reimburse us the damages? Obviously not.<p>I want you to realize that the timeliness of your response is completely irrelevant to the matter at hand.<p>Proper net etiquette would be to have a reasonable limit of an ACTUAL 1 req/sec, not an average. Furthermore, allow only the webmaster of the site to increase the rate.<p>Also, while nofollow sculpting is not the original intention of the metatag, MANY people use it as such, so respect that directive.<p>Also, you can have your system be aware when a site is slow to respond and adjust crawl rates/times as necessary.<p>Also, user-agent protections are not enough. Many webservers have built-in automatic IP-based attack detection/prevention, but as far as I know, most don't have user-agent based systems. The new virtual land is distributed and webservers have to react to that new reality, but the onus is on you to be aware that many people are still running legacy systems.<p>If you guys did that from the beginning there wouldn't be an issue. And I'm sure all those complaints you see on other webmaster forums would largely go away as well.<p>There are many things you can/could've done to prevent this problem. There's things we could have done as well, but placing the blame on us is akin to blaming a robbed family for not locking the door. Sure, said family should have locked the door, but that in no way excuses the robber of their actions.<p>I know it's a lot easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, but when you're performing the equivalent of a DDoS attack and causing immediate and direct financial damages to a company... that doesn't fly.",1263672307

Sadly, VG is still buggy and the amount of people playing is dropping, and combined with the dearth of support for the game from Sony (Everquest is still the star at SOE) for VG, it will be around as long as the subscriber numbers stay high enough.<p>Disclaimer: I've played Vanguard on and off since beta (this handle is the name of one of my characters on Seradon), and I think it has great promise, however the game is a case study in how <i>not</i> to do things in the MMO industry.",1263672273

Of course, quests and such were hand-crafted later, this was just for the names, star systems, connections between them, NPC-controlled space stations, planets, moons, asteroid belts, resources, etc.<p>The real problem IMO is that autogenerated content can't be any more inherently interesting than the algorithm that created it.  In EVE, this wasn't a problem, because the autogenerated content was merely intended as a ""playing field"" on which other events happened, but if the autogenerated content <i>is the content itself</i>, I think you'll have serious problems making it non-repetitive.",1263672138

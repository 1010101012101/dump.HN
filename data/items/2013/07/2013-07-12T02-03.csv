Especially when they&#x27;re smart.<p>Imagine having a porsche in your driveway, but for reasons you can only use the first gear. No matter how hard you push the pedal to the metal, you won&#x27;t be as fast as you want the car to go. Plus if you keep going full throttle in the first gear eventually you&#x27;ll break something.<p>Sounds depressing, doesn&#x27;t it? And that&#x27;s exactly what happens. People eventually get depressed. It won&#x27;t go away by itself. When they go to the doctor, it&#x27;s basically a game of chance. If the doctor is competent, he&#x27;ll do the proper tests. Unfortunately most aren&#x27;t. There are a lot of syndromes, illnesses, conditions that match the symptoms.<p>If the ADD patient is lucky, the correct diagnosis is made. If unlucky, he may be treated for borderline, depressions, etc. Antidepressants may worsen the condition, because they may increase motivation without increasing ability.<p>A well diagnosed and medicated ADD patient however will lose depression in almost no time.",1373597808
6030660,comment,6030252,6030597,0,0,benjamincburns,,,"> Honest question: could your success be at all attributed to placebo? IOW, is there any question at all as to whether or not you could have made a conscious decision to &quot;buckle down&quot; and have met the same result?<p>I&#x27;m 27 now. I began taking ADHD medication when I was 21. With the exception of methamphetamine (yes, it&#x27;s actually an old, crude ADHD treatment) I believe I&#x27;ve taken every FDA-approved ADHD drug there is - both stimulant and non-stimulant. Even the patch. It was a hard road to figure out what is effective for me with minimal side effects, but there&#x27;s absolutely no doubt in my mind that medication contributes heavily to my success.<p>The sensation is difficult to describe, but when I&#x27;m not medicated I&#x27;m often completely unaware that my focus has shifted. No amount of mental exertion (aka &quot;buckling down&quot;) changes that for me.<p>I&#x27;m a <i>very</i> passionate software engineer. I wake up in the morning and before I&#x27;ve put clothes on I&#x27;m reading about something to do with software. Chances are the last thing I look at before I fall asleep also has something to do with software. This has been constant since I was 12 years old -- long before I was medicated. In college, before I was medicated, there was absolutely no way I&#x27;d be able to make it through a lecture and retain all of the information -- even while taking notes. I&#x27;d pause to think about something the professor said, and a few tangents later I&#x27;d be drawing unicorn fish or something in the margins. I still have the notebooks. I&#x27;ve gone back and looked -- the difference between before and after I was medicated was <i>stark</i> [1].<p>Whether or not medication is the right choice is a very individual decision. Hell, even your doctor doesn&#x27;t really know. If you have the ability to &quot;buckle down&quot; when needed and you don&#x27;t feel like your life is ready to crumble because you&#x27;re just barely getting by - you&#x27;re probably fine. There&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> these drugs can do to mess up your life [2] and the narcotic effects can be plenty distracting on their own if your doctor is too liberal with your dosage.<p>1: Something worth noting is that an outside observer might view this as having my creativity squelched. &quot;Oh look at all the drawings, and now just boring mechanical notes? This person&#x27;s soul has been snuffed out by the evil chemicals!&quot; The truth is just the opposite - I was finally able to direct my creative energy where I wanted, and the feeling was utterly <i>profound</i>.<p>2: Appetite suppression, insomnia, depression, addiction, heart palpitations, aggressiveness, diminished sexual desire, and horrible irritability are all common side effects. They might not all meet the FDA definition of &quot;common,&quot; but they&#x27;re plenty common enough.",1373597786
6030659,comment,6029823,6029823,2,0,gaelenh,,,"I follow a similar strategy when I&#x27;m interviewing for a job.  I play it a little loose and speak freely.  If they don&#x27;t have the good sense to realize that questions about my resume or github code are more important than white boarding and programming riddles, then I don&#x27;t want work for or with them.  When I&#x27;m interviewing to hire someone, I reverse the situation and try to get them to loosen up.  The interview process is a window into company culture.<p>Same goes when I&#x27;m setting up partnerships for STEAM classes with schools.  Schools can be strict with their staff and their students.  I don&#x27;t ever want to put forward a persona that suggest I will also be strict or by the book because that will never work out.  No one will be happy.<p>I suppose if I can&#x27;t ever find a job and no one will let me teach, it&#x27;s time to re-examine my personality.

Thinking outside the box, breaking the rules as a last resort to do the right thing and other similar actions <i>can indeed</i> produce the extraordinary results, in certain situations, the organization is hoping for after all. Yet this strategy will work only for the very top performers: Those who can sense and <i>actually produce</i> the truly largest &quot;contribution&quot; to their company (as opposed to what seems right, interesting or cool to them), even when it more or less eludes their higher ups; those who can do this while also being politically savvy enough to contain the consequences and sell their actions as actually in line with everyone&#x27;s goals; those who are almost magical in being able to produce the kind of results others are very unlikely to do etc. It can work, I&#x27;ve seen it work, but I think it is important to realize that not everyone can or should do it.

I think manufacturing tolerances will be the biggest limit for inexpensive handsets.<p>If I play (hah!) stupid, I look at the flange distance and lens size for an SLR of any sort and compare it to a mirrorless camera such as the M9 or even NEX-7, I can get much higher quality on the same or smaller sensor with smaller lenses, especially in the normal field of view.  This is purely based on that big empty space in the SLR.  The main thing we&#x27;ll have to give up is an expectation of a shallow depth of field, but &quot;f/8 and be there&quot; is why camera phones are useful anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve been impressed with the sapphire lens on the iPhone 5, all things considered.

When they increase across the board, some airlines may raise prices, others may cut back on services offered, still others may add baggage fees, some may focus on increasing volume on more profitable routes, some may lower prices and heavily promote their lower fares to gain market share, while others may risk prepaying for fuel at current prices or hedging with shorts, etc.<p>Point being, of course, that the same change that hits every competitor will produce different responses and effects. This can completely alter the competitive landscape. And, it&#x27;s virtually a guarantee that you won&#x27;t simply get some uniform, across the board price increase.<p>If we don&#x27;t acknowledge this, then we are looking at the change in a vacuum, completely insulated from the realities of free market behavior.<p>><i>I  could make the argument that the consumers are willing to pay more because they suddenly have more in their pockets</i><p>Yeah, I think I actually mentioned that in another post (too much risk/work to view another post mid-reply on this tablet).

That is, there are a lot of variables that might impact whether they&#x27;d be willing to spend that extra money on that product. Also, there is still some price that the market simply won&#x27;t bear for a given  product, irrespective of the extra money in consumer pockets. In any case, there is certainly no guarantee that companies can simply pass on the additional cost.<p>And, it can also be the case that some companies can, but others cannot, given their prior prices.<p>Just too many variables.",1373595829

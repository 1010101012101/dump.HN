Talking to one type of therapist works as well as talking to another type of therapist. Even talking to a priest works as well as talking to a therapist.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict</a><p>This article is more interesting for me in that it supports the dodo bird verdict. Cognitive behavioral therapy results have for a while been put forward as the exception. According to the article, those results have been inflated, and there are no exceptions.<p>edit: of course, if you consider a priest the control for the psychology industry - then it may be fair to say that established therapies have no better success than placebo. Is a priest a placebo?<p>edit: tl;dr<p>-----<p>&quot;The most commonly studied of [talk therapies is] cognitive behavior therapy — in which people learn to identify and defuse automatic, self-defeating assumptions, like &#x27;I’m unlucky in love&#x27; or &#x27;I always choke&#x27; — and interpersonal therapy, which focuses on reshaping how people interact with others. These studies typically have subjects engage in weekly, hourlong sessions with a therapist for three to four months.<p>&quot;The researchers found that 13 of these funded studies were completed but never published, usually because those who did the trials did not think a finding of no benefit stood much chance of being published. The team contacted each of the 13 investigators originally paid to do the work and requested their data. Once that data was included with those from the other, published papers, the effectiveness of the therapies dropped significantly — by about a quarter.<p>&quot;&#x27;That seems to be the magic number, a quarter — about the same as you see in the pharma trials&#x27; of antidepressants, said a co-author, Dr. Erick Turner, an associate professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University and the lead author of the 2008 paper detailing bias in those drug trials.&quot;",1443877165

I can give you any function on some interval (sufficiently well behaved) and you can compute the Fourier series of it. Even though it&#x27;s only defined on the interval, if you plotted the Fourier series you would still find it to be periodic. The same idea carries over to the spectral derivative. Even if the function isn&#x27;t periodic, the method still works, it&#x27;s just that the numerics near the discontinuity are going to be crap and can affect things further away. But if you are sufficiently far away, things are kosher. Note there are ways of dealing with this using Chebyshev interpolation (see <a href=""http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/fft-deriv.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/fft-deriv.pdf</a> section 6) which Trefethen&#x27;s book also discusses.<p>And no FFTs are the only transformations I am aware of.

I don&#x27;t have a problem with Therapy.  Is hard to study, and at worst it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bad side side effects--besides on the wallet?<p>We do get are feathers ruffled when Psychiartic drugs(mainly tricyclic, and hetricyclic antidepressants) are brought up.<p>Why, because so many of us took them.<p>I took them.  My friends took them.  I even encouraged a ex-girlfriend to take them.  In my case they never worked, but I believed the literature, and thought I was just unlucky.  I spent thousands on different drugs for depression and anxiety.  I can&#x27;t put a price on the side effects, and disillusionment.<p>I imagine a lot of people are still on them.  They were billed as the Wonder drugs.  They were very expensive.  Patients and Doctors were equally lied to by drug companies.  They caused a lot of unnessary pain, and suffering.  Too many people are still on them.  I sometimes wonder if there&#x27;s a correlation between some of these drugs and violence?  I know if I was a prescriber, I don&#x27;t think I would prescribe a heterocyclic Drug(Proxax, Zoloft, etc.).  I just don&#x27;t believe they work, but the industry is trying so hard to still justify their use--in selected patients--you know the &quot;sickest patients seem to get a bit better--sometimes--in some situations?&quot;<p>If the history, and study of Erythromycin is in any way like the history, and study of Prozax; I will never take another antibiotic again.<p>It&#x27;s not that we hate all Psychiatric drugs, but some of them, especially the Happy Pills; were studied terribly, some even fraudently, and a lot of psychiatric patients are still very leary of a lot of these drugs;  And so are the drug companies.  I don&#x27;t see any dancing pills in commercials anymore like I did in the 90&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s?  I just see ads by Lawyers.  I don&#x27;t see hubristic Psychiatrists advertising as &quot;Chemical Imbalance Specilists&quot; anymore.   Psychiatry was hit hard by the deceitfulness  of these drug comapnies.

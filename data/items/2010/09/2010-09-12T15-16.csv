I feel the same way about many post-graduate experiences as you do about college, and it's important to try to see things with more shades of grey and to be more open to positive experiences.<p>Remember, no one is going to put you in a prison for four years, but by not going to college now (or not applying... etc) you are losing on some opportunities that you might like, even in six months.

Unlike Paglia, Crawford's ideas are based on time actually spent in the trades --- as an electrician and as a mechanic. Unlike Paglia, Crawford's idea isn't simply that the elite schools are out of step with the jobs market, but rather that our alienation from the trades and crafts are inherently worrisome whether or not the money's there for them. Crawford can point to captive consumerism, the plastic and disposable nature of the goods we buy, and the degradation of self-reliance as consequences of the trend towards ""knowledge work""; he's not simply suggesting that more people become tradesmen so he can be left to his cushy academic job.<p>I don't love the book, but consider it as having been worth reading. It's also clearly just one in a line of similar books going back several generations (it may stretch back to the Transcendentalists). For people like Paglia and Brooks to write as if this is an insight that they just recently achieved is disingenuous.",1284306637

I was in the same condition as you are in, I decided to drop out from university in 7th Semester ( 4th year ). But I changed by decision because of practical reasons, I have two jobs, one Linux Administration and one as Software Engineer without degree, but I decided to continue , am still in 4th year 8th semester, what I advice you is to continue instead of leaving, if you had got a chance to CS degree, I think you should continue.<p>For sure, people will hire you without a degree, if you have good portfolio and out of the box skills.<p>I want to share a experience of mine, I was offered a job in Samsung as contract position , and my CV was selected. But I prefered to complete degree before leaving. I think a degree is important, a piece of paper will give you confidence in facing people and employers.<p>Thanks.",1284304986

1) Google Docs will store any file. 
2) Google Docs allows you to convert pdfs to docs & edit them.<p>With this in mind, I prefer Google Docs, as Dropbox, to my eye, has no advantage. Perhaps you would argue that Dropbox syncs automatically.

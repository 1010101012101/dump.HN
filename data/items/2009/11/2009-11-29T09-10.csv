966178,comment,965982,965982,0,0,anatoly,,,"I think this is a terrible way to interview. I've encountered, again and again, candidates who appear to be very intelligent, you can have a great discussion with them, terrific rapport, they understand everything, they give interesting suggestions, and when you ask them to write a simple piece of code they absolutely cannot do it. Not because they're stressed etc., you can actually see they can't write code. Sometimes the incongruity between their confident appearance and convincing talk versus their inability to write code is mind-boggling.<p>Now I consider any interview process incomplete and utterly unreliable if it doesn't include writing actual code, however simple and straightforward.",1259488494

But, I wish it were a little easier to use ...<p>For example, each of my servers creates a backup named something of the form 'machineName-epochTime' every night. I wish there was some built in way to delete all but the last N backups. I ended up writing a small Python script to take care of it, but it relies on text-munging, etc and seems brittle.<p>Something that would automate a 'grandfather, father, son' style rotation scheme would be appreciated too.<p>In principle, it isn't too hard for me to script any of this functionality - but maybe I'll make a mistake in the portion of my code that handles my Tarsnap key, or the portion that deletes backups. I'd rather pay someone smarter than me (e.g., cpercival) to specialize on making my backups work. That is, after all, the basic premise behind the Tarsnap business model.",1259488447

The vast majority of those people have cold symptoms:  cough, runny nose, fever, chills, etc...  But, every now and then, it strikes like lightning and a young person has an overwhelming immune response to the disease and their lungs fill up and they crap out.<p>I saw a person die of swine flu last week.  Right after that, I discharged 3 people with swine flu symptoms.  It's a strange little disease.  Get the vaccine if you can, and at very least get the regular flu vaccine.  It may give you a partial immunity.  The more people in the herd we can get immunized, the better off everyone is going to be.  I don't get to worried about it, though.<p>There's always a worry about a recurrence of the ""pandemic flu of 1918"", and the H1N1 outbreak meets the definitions of pandemic.  But, when the media talks about the pandemic of 1918, they forget the medicine has changed just a little bit in the last 90 years.  For instance:<p>-Oxygen wasn't really in regular use until the 1920's-30's.
 -Germ theory had only gotten widespread acceptance for 20-30 years.
 -Antibiotics weren't mass produced until Sulfa in 1936.  Before then, a lot of people died that could have been cured with a shot of penicillin or sulfa.
 -IV medications were given with glass syringes and recycled needles until the 70's.<p>I'm sure a large percentage of the 50 million people that died in the 1918 pandemic would have lived with basic modern medical care.",1259486986

In mathematics one has strong opinions and can state them clearly, and in reply, people can tell you you're wrong without it being mistaken for a personal attack.  I guess I just let that leak over into here - now being in business I usually keep it under wraps.<p>That's what I meant elsewhere when I said I would be less open.

This sort of headline is a depressing trend.<p>But it is an interesting pattern for software architecture/engineering, and I'm glad to learn about it.  I'll admit that after reading this summary I'm not entirely clear on how this marks any sort of revolutionary change in program design.  Instead, it strikes me as a mental shift enabled by a few years' reflection on what MVC aspires to be.  Indeed, the author says as much: ""This may not seem like a really big change and indeed, technically, it is not. However the mental shift is huge!""<p>I'm not a Java developer, but in Ruby this sounds something like implementing a significant amount of program logic in modules rather than directly in a Merb/Rails/Datamapper/what-have-you model in order to achieve a looser coupling of the data/business logic layer.<p>So, I dunno. It's a really cool idea, and welcome to HN...but please change the headline to something less sensational/linkbait and more informative like - ""Data/Context/Interaction - Thinking Beyond MVC Structure.""",1259486132
966152,comment,965832,965832,0,0,simonw,,,"As a client- and server-side developer I'm extremely excited about HTML5. For the first time in a decade, browsers are getting new capabilities! HTML 5 is much more than just new tags - we're talking offline support, concurrency with web workers, canvas, geolocation, native audio and video, WebSockets, a supported method of making cross-domain API calls...<p>HTML 5 is clearly aiming to bring the open web platform up to par with desktop APIs. I expect many desktop applications to be developed using HTML5+CSS+JavaScript within just a few years.<p>And even if that doesn't spike your interest, there's the critically important role the HTML 5 spec pays in standardising what we already have. It's ridiculous that XMLHttpRequest, one of the most useful modern browser APIs, has no spec - every browser implements it by reverse engineering the others, who in turn reverse engineered IE (which is closed source, so who knows if they got it right?). HTML5 fixes that. It also specifies things like innerHTML, ContentEditable, the execution order for script files, all that DOM level 0 stuff that never made it in to an official spec.<p>Finally, HTML5 specifies a formal error model for HTML for the first time. This means it will actually be possible to implement a new browser from scratch without having to spend years reverse engineering the behaviour of IE and friends when faced with invalid markup.<p>I'm amazed to see so many web developers unexcited by HTML 5. This is the first time our core platform has seen any serious evolution since HTML4.01 was published in 1999!<p>As for browser support, it's happening right now. If you develop for the iPhone / mobile WebKit stuff most of the above features are sitting there waiting for you to use them. Try this page in your iPhone for example:<p><a href=""http://simonwillison.net/static/2009/navigator.geolocation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simonwillison.net/static/2009/navigator.geolocation.h...</a><p>Even IE is catching up - IE8 supported a bunch of HTML5 concepts (key/value based storage, cross document messaging, hashchange event and more) and IE9 is set to support even more.<p>HTML 5 is the most exciting thing to happen to web development in a very long time.",1259486010

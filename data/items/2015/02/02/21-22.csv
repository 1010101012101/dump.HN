You&#x27;re right in your original reply to me that if you want to go reuse buffers with leftover data, you can do that in any language. If you want to create a byte array in Java, fill it with private key material, then reuse the same byte array for an output buffer... what can stop that?<p>But more to my point: in C, I could end up executing arbitrary code by misparsing a network packet. In Rust, the worst I&#x27;ll do is parse it wrong send invalid data onwards. That&#x27;s just a massive reduction in scope.<p>I suppose if you have a tool that writes to arbitrary, attacker-supplied file locations, that could have a severe impact. Or it could pass an attacker-controlled value to the shell without escaping.<p>But things like the cpio[1] bug mentioned in the lessopen issue. Or the numerous compression libraries that require trusted inputs. Image manipulation code. And on and on. How many of them become simple crashes with a memory safe language? Cause from my unscientific (and flawed as this entire article is about) review, it seems like the great majority are these memory safety issues. Perhaps 90%? For widespread code, am I that far off the mark?

I tend to focus on the .1% (point one percent) because my people are very skilled in their domain and I want to keep them.<p>What&#x27;s interesting to me is that there used to be a glass ceiling for salaries for programmers.  It moved with inflation but it was very apparent (to me at least).  When I was a programmer at Sun (1988-1994 or so) the ceiling was in the $130K area.<p>If you wanted to make more than that you needed to go into management.<p>That seems to have gone away.  When I checked this year for total [1] comp package I found that it appears to be about $325K.  Remember, this is the .1%, these are people that google and apple and facebook and netflix all know by reputation and they all compete for the same person.<p>I dunno what a director makes these days but I&#x27;d guess that it is in the $300-400K range.  The fact that an engineer, with no management duties, can make what a director makes is a relatively new thing.  That didn&#x27;t happen 20 years ago.<p>To try and more directly answer your question, if you don&#x27;t get the payout (and I would bet that at least 95% of programmers don&#x27;t, there is\na reason I go by &quot;luckydude&quot;) then it is super hard to maintain a decent lifestyle on a single salary.  I&#x27;ve got a guy working for me, I pay over market, he still struggles to make ends meet.  He could make it easier on himself by living in a cheaper area but he has two kids, wants good schools, good schools are most of what drives housing prices.<p>Too long; don&#x27;t read: no kids means you can have fun, kids means you need two salaries.<p>[1] Total comp: salary, bonuses, healthcare, 401K match.  Salary != comp.  Many, many people look at only salary.  We pay full healthcare for the whole family, that&#x27;s $30K or more per year for a family of 4.  We dump as much as we can into 401K each year, that can be another $30K or more.  Etc.  Total comp is all of that.",1422914140

Like if your water was charged at a dollar a gallon. Because there&#x27;s just one provider.<p>To continue the analogy, people had &quot;unlimited&quot; water before, and they might use 10, or 100, or 400 gallons in a month, they&#x27;re not really sure. And then TWC applies a cap of 60 gallons and wants double the money if you want 100 gallons. If you hit 200 gallons before for some reason, forget it. No one in your area is offering you that.<p>So people said &quot;what&#x27;s this caps, screw caps, no more caps!&quot; because they were crazy caps, and you couldn&#x27;t just pay a roughly linear rate for more data.<p>Comcast used to have a 250GB cap, which is more reasonable. But it&#x27;s flat, for all consumer tiers. And you can&#x27;t pay less for 100GB or a bit more for 270GB.<p>And various companies at various times have had &quot;unofficial&quot; caps.<p>I think pay-per-gig-used could be reasonable, but I understand why many people are dead against it, so far it&#x27;s only been a way to screw them.",1422914073

For a counter-anecdote, see the story of Southwest, an airline started with solely intrastate routes, which kept it from FAA regulation and allowed it to compete on price in a way that other airlines couldn&#x27;t. It now carries the most domestic passengers[0], is highly rated for customer service, and has posted >40 straight profitable years (including the span of the most recent recession)[1]. FAA regulation was considered necessary due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an airline.<p>I am fully aware of the concept of a natural monopoly (econ major here), but the fact is that the majority of cable providers were granted exclusive franchises by municipalities. You may object to the source, but I am at work and don&#x27;t have time to track down other support for this statement. Hopefully we can both accept the facts even if you object to the reasoning[3]. The article is talking about cable television, but since the incumbent ISPs are the same firms as the cable television providers, I hope you can agree that the analysis, regardless of your agreement or disagreement, is at least relevant.<p>Finally, there are many areas with multiple cable companies/ISPs (I live in one, and recently moved from an area where Verizon made a large FiOS investment and is competing very effectively with TWC - I do know that they&#x27;ve put a stop to expansion on FiOS). It is clearly possible to see competition in this area. The fact that many/most municipalities offered exclusive franchises and that we now see many monopolies in this area is only proof that many people _believed_ cable service to be a natural monopoly, not that it is. The fact that we see areas with competition in this sector is a strong piece of evidence that natural monopoly is not the case.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines</a>\n[1]<a href=""http://southwest.investorroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1975"" rel=""nofollow"">http://southwest.investorroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1975</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa034.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa034.html</a>",1422913852

This whole post sounds like why it&#x27;s bad for you and provides no reason why it would be bad for the vast majority of people.<p>If that is what it sounds like I&#x27;m sorry because that was not what I wanted to convey. I wanted to convey that Title II regulation may solve the net neutrality issue in the short term, but may set a framework and precedent that will subject all ISPs (and the Internet) to other harmful regulations which could ensure we never move beyond the duopoly we have now. Remember cable companies and AT&T are masters of guiding agency regulation and state laws (see for example the state laws banning municipal fiber projects). They are probably going to lose this round because of the public outcry and their outrageous behavior regarding net neutrality, but we should be very weary of what they will be able to do with the new regulatory framework.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything to do with the VOIP company anymore, my only skin in the game is as a ISP customer whose only choices are Time Warner and AT&T for internet access, both of which offer what I consider crappy service and speeds.\nAlthough I actually spent several months and a bit of money looking to put together a local fiber ISP in my area, but in the end shelved (or put on hold) the plans due to a (mostly state/municipal) regulatory environment that was heavily tilted in favor of incumbent companies who were cable cos or telcos.",1422913747

Neither Doom 3 nor Alan Wake could use this technique. I mostly work on consoles nowadays, so I use none of these APIs. On PS3/PS4 you have to do everything manually, instead of using nice OpenGL API to bind and send vertex buffer object,you have to allocate memory for it yourself and copy it over manually to the address that you want.

The compiler interpreted certain pragmas like &quot;impure&quot; and &quot;exception&quot; in a special way, outputting a warning when certain language features were used inside functions marked with the pragma. The language manual shows that the compiler still at least supports these special pragmas.

To me, it means that &quot;x[somenumber]&quot; make the program abort if somenumber is out of range. However, as you can see, the reads and writes were never out of range. As I see it, the issue is that uninitialized memory is being read. This is not &quot;unsafe&quot;, cause it will never crash your program. I don&#x27;t know the exact definition of &quot;undefined behaviour&quot;, but since we are using a custom allocator, even if reading from freshly malloc&#x27;ed memory is undefined, it may not be in this case.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t let you get uninitialized memory without using &quot;unsafe&quot;, so to construct a program with the issue, he had to reuse the buffer. I think it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> less likely to happen with Rust, since it is visible to anyone that it is the same buffer.<p>> If he had ignored the custom allocator and used the defaults in both languages (e.g. malloc in C, whatever it is in Rust)<p>How do you know the default allocator isn&#x27;t using memory that was previously used for the private key?

New entrants are trying to compete in the market place. One proven effective way to gain a foothold in a market with entrenched players is to offer a loss leader. Say a new firm figures out that it can gain a lot of customers with a specific strategy - a cheap plan that is very restrictive on total bandwidth, except for Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix.

You aren&#x27;t upset because Comcast offers _a_ plan that throttles Netflix, rather you are upset that you did not choose that plan. While in the short term eliminating that choice may improve your situation (or maybe Comcast offers worse service or raises the price or otherwise adjusts its behavior in a way that makes you feel worse off), in the long term it is impossible to make people better off by reducing the options which they may consider.",1422911939

So implicitly, the real goal is that nobody demand change.<p>You can&#x27;t get stuck in a local maximum if you&#x27;re looking for a global maximum. You have to prove that you are <i>at</i> a global maximum to resist change, and you have to prove it to those who demand change.<p>The only way to get there is to find out what people actually want and need, and to deliver it.",1422911659

Any benefit to the shareholders is usually incidental, and the corporation would eliminate these benefits if it increased the benefit to the corporation.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Any benefit to the corporation is a de facto benefit to the shareholders of that corporation.<p>> The type of shenanigans you have suggested as a means of increasing expenses are what tax practitioners call &quot;tax evasion schemes&quot; that (a) would not work and (b) would result in heft fines and/or prison sentences for the executives, board members, and accountants involved.<p>It is only tax evasion if the code is explicit enough to rule it out as allowable behavior...a feat of endurance for tax authorities. Even then, many legal tax avoidance behaviors would be non-existent or drastically less common if it weren&#x27;t for corporate taxation.<p>Employee benefits, for example, only make sense if there is a bulk discount on those benefits sufficient to make sense to buy as a group. Sometimes vendors offer those discounts. But the existence of benefits as tax deductable expenses means an additional 40% discount over individual purchase. If your corporate lunchroom is subsidized (extremely common in mid to large size corporations), it is likely because that subsidy is tax deductible, whereas an individual purchasing their own lunch is not.<p>Compliance and enforcement costs are roughly proportional to the cartesian product of the complexity of the rules and the number of entities. Sure, pushing taxes onto shareholders increases the number of entities, but drastically reduces the number of rules, due to the fact that personal income tax is not a profit tax. The corporate tax has to have millions of rules and exceptions to rules because businesses are drastically different and legitimate expenses for one business may be illegitimate for another. I totally understand that there are way more shareholders than there are companies, but the difference in the number of rules between corporate taxes and and the marginal increase in rules on personal income taxes <i>easily</i> makes up the difference.",1422911417

And the band that people are envisioning putting the aerosats in has, well, less sulfuric acid than does the denser lower atmosphere.<p>Honestly, probably the realistic view is that it never makes sense to colonize, or even send long-term human presence to, any planet besides Earth.  But to the extent that we want to dream of human presence on another planet, I think that the big obstacle to Venus is not the hostility of the upper atmosphere, it&#x27;s the difficulty in getting any non-gaseous resources out of it.<p>At the very least, it seems like sending a robotic balloon probe to Venus to try to tool around in the upper atmosphere for an extended period of time is at least as worthwhile as sending another lander to Mars.",1422910920

If you have a library that uses callbacks or some other thing, you can just wrap it such that it now uses promises. And then of course you can always look for alternate libraries that use promises from the start and skip step as well.<p>I&#x27;ve found that using promises for everything works super well. There is no confusion or doubt at all. Everything has the potential to branch into async at any time with no consequences and without complicating the flow. And an additional benefit is that rather than checking for errors after any operation you do, you choose where to check for errors. When a promise rejects, it skips everything else in the chain until it gets to a catch. So rather than running 4 async operations and doing an &quot;if error do this&quot; after each operation kind of deal, you can catch the error in once place and handle it once. Promises surpress the error in the promise chain until you choose to handle it, which is dangerous if you don&#x27;t understand how promises work, but really useful once you do.<p>There are really solid promise-based libraries for all common operations in node right now. When.js for general promises, composition, and coercion, rest.js for network requests, bookshelf and knex for database connection and orm stuff, etc. If you are a js developer, give them a shot!<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not trying to claim that this is better than any other language-level construct by any means, but if you are working in javascript, where you have to deal with javascript&#x27;s limitations as a language, from experience I can say that working in an all-promises environment makes things quite pleasant.",1422910901

8986947,comment,8983875,8986086,0,0,pluma,,,"I&#x27;d say learning an instrument is definitely one of those things that don&#x27;t necessary have a direct impact, but can be a blessing as an adult. Basically, it avoids a common regret (I never learned an instrument, but I don&#x27;t care enough to spend the time to learn it now that I&#x27;m hitting 30) and provides a way to get into music (instruments or not) with less investment. It opens possibilities for a number of hobbies.<p>Sports are a great way to learn social skills. In order to participate in a team sport (consistently) you need to learn how to deal with people that aren&#x27;t as pre-selected to your taste as the friends you make in school. You also learn something other people may be worse at than you, which can help with confidence. Especially if the more experienced players are encouraged to train beginners.<p>Most other things are just examples of these or should already be (partially) covered in school, depending on your school system.<p>Many of these should be recreational for the kid. For example, if they hate instrument practice but can read music and understand the basics, I don&#x27;t see any harm in replacing it with something else at some point.<p>In the end, you just have to be good enough. My childhood left me with a few issues, but most of them sorted themselves out in early adulthood. Just keep this in mind: the reason there are so many opinions on what is the &quot;right way&quot; to raise a child, is that every parent is afraid of doing it wrong. Most advice is anecdotal and the reason people feel strongly about it is that they don&#x27;t want to have been wrong, not that &quot;it just works&quot;.<p>Disclaimer: am not a parent.",1422910879

Once people start looking to &quot;science&quot; for a policy recommendation, the dialogue immediately becomes polarized and extreme.<p>No one in the public discourse is saying our thinking on vaccinations is being continuously refined. No one is publicly urging caution and moderation in evaluating the risks and benefits, or calling for better longitudinal studies. Instead, on the one had, you have the white house saying &quot;the science is clear,&quot; people calling anti-vaxers morons on social media, and on the other side people yelling that its poison pushed by a global conspiracy. Whatever calm, analytic discussions are being held behind closed doors at the NIH, the public discourse has degenerated into a screaming match.<p>Adam&#x27;s problem with that is that the pro-science people are screaming just as loudly as their opponents... but they should be the ones that know better! Unfortunately, people of a certain age have seen dogmatic claims from &quot;the scientific community&quot; before, and then seen those claims be overturned and reversed countless times. That&#x27;s a problem. If you really are &quot;pro-science&quot; you should ALWAYS be couching your recommendations in uncertain terms, but there are lots of demagogues out there doing exactly the opposite.",1422910872

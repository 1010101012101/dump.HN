Both of them are accessed sequentially once you seek to the correct block, and that was the point of the article. Relative to seek time, disk reads are taking longer (a consequence of one physical head serving more potential bits).<p>I tried to get Seagate to put two independent R/W heads in a disk once.

And again what this article is saying is that even dynamic RAM today, looks more like an I/O device than memory.<p>In the early 2000&#x27;s at NetApp, one of the performance engineers managed to track down the performance limiter on Pentium 4&#x27;s to the frontside bus memory controller. The FSB could only issue so many memory transactions per second, and the P4 had doubled the length of a cache line (that improved streaming performance at the expense of everything else).

Though I didn&#x27;t get a degree, I eventually went on to learn about operating systems, sockets, basic algorithms and data structures.<p>However, in my opinion getting a CS degree would be frustrating if I were to do it all over again.

Low-density, but there. When you have a generator that produces an electric potential bias across the top/bottom of the craft, you end up with electrons being emitted into space from and positive ions being attracted to the side biased negative, and electrons in the ionosphere being attracted to the side biased positive.

So even assuming Adobe&#x27;s DNG converter perfectly supports your camera, you still need code to handle its underlying sensor data format (your Bayer demosaicing code won&#x27;t be much help in processing data from, <i>e.g.,</i> a Foveon sensor) and whatever mandatory image correction it requires (<i>e.g.,</i> many cameras and lenses rely on software correction driven by camera- or lens-supplied metadata, and will yield <i>heavily</i> distorted images if this correction is skipped).<p>In other words, until camera development stagnates, raw processing is a moving target by its very nature.<p>With that said, AFAIK, Aperture uses public OS X APIs for raw support, so potential Aperture replacements on OS X can get up-to-date raw support &quot;for free&quot;. Given that Photos will support camera raw, this announcement gives me no reason to believe Apple won&#x27;t continue to add support for new cameras in future OS X updates.

They stay because their partner is who they are looking for, someone who enriches their life.  Healthy people sting for a bit when dumped, but they get over it and find someone new.<p>Also, the boyfriend/girlfriend stage doesn&#x27;t match up with what I&#x27;ve seen: people who dump their boyfriend/girlfriend &quot;because someone better comes along&quot; usually find that the new person isn&#x27;t better at all, and in the meantime they&#x27;ve labeled themselves as fickle and capricious in the minds of friends and prospective dates.  Rather, it&#x27;s time to end a relationship when your continued partnership is making you unhappy, regardless of whether there is someone better out there.  And as long as you are happy, you are unlikely to be <i>more</i> happy with someone else.<p>I&#x27;d argue that even with these corrections, viewing work like a romantic relationship still makes no sense.  The cornerstone of romantic relationships is equal emotional investment, and the idea that beneath all the trappings, we&#x27;re fundamentally all just people.  Business is different because:<p>1. There is an inherent power imbalance between employer and employee.  A company is never going to love you back, nor will you ever fulfill as important a role for it as it does for you.<p>2. Companies will and should respond to changing market conditions.  Those changes sometimes mean that whole roles disappear, and employees who want to perform those roles can and should go elsewhere.  A romantic relationship is hopefully based on qualities more fundamental than &quot;what professional role do I want to occupy?&quot;<p>3. If a company refuses to make hard choices about employment and market positioning, the market makes it for them, with the result that <i>everybody</i> is hunting for a new job.",1403900756

It will send a message to a client, the client processes it and sends an explicit ack (message consumed), at which point RMQ will send the next message. The client can also send a nack (push the job back onto the queue and redeliver it), and if the connection is dropped without the job being ack&#x27;d, then RMQ will requeue it and send it to another client.<p>If you&#x27;re performing all your state mutations in a transaction or something similar that rolls back when a worker terminates, then you can avoid losing jobs and ending up in invalid state even during non-clean shutdowns.<p>As far as other notable changes go, you can have multi-queue routing (one message can be routed into multiple queues) and dead letter exchanges (so that TTL expired messages can be sent to a different queue rather than just being dropped).

7956085,comment,7955671,7955882,2,0,ryanklee,,,"> Music, because of the visceral reactions it elicits, tends to be best experienced in a live setting. The animation and general atmosphere of the crowd brings a lot to the emotional table that is lost elsewhere, including home listening rooms.<p>Definitely a generalization, as you caveated. With few exceptions, my appreciation for musical depth is substantially <i>lessened</i> in a live setting.<p>One such exception is a venue with theater seating and an observant audience. The crowd sits and absorbs. I&#x27;m not taking chamber orchestra here, either. I mean Will Oldham or Bill Callahan or X-refined-&quot;indie&quot; band. Another is certain kinds of music played live in small bars where everyone is rip roaringly drunk and ecstatic but <i>not</i> focused on the performers, but engaged with the elevated social tenor, which includes dancing, senseless mixing, mingling and disregard for decorum. Random bluegrass works well for this.<p>But largely (read: basically always), I <i>need</i> to consume music in either solitude or in extremely intimate, restricted, established, and empathetic company. Otherwise I can&#x27;t concentrate on my emotional responses or develop complex relationships with the work!<p>I don&#x27;t mean that this is Appolonian for me. The contrary is true: it&#x27;s Dionysian, but that&#x27;s the kind of thing I can&#x27;t get when surrounded, socially navigating, self-conscious and worried about the perception of others. Too much, not enough, as they say. My focus is a fragile thing, easily dismantled. (I envy the robust among you!)<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m just digressing here, not disagreeing, esp. as you allowed for the fact that you are generalizing a bit. My experience differs vis-à-vis musical appreciation. Certain friends of mine have expressed similar feelings.<p>But is it surprising that relationships to art will be as varied as people and art objects themselves?<p>My guess is that there is at least a baker&#x27;s dozen worth of people out there who prefer listening to music through barriers we can&#x27;t understand, and still as many whose appreciation for music and voice and song comes from not hearing it at all.",1403900210

You&#x27;re absolutely right that we need to do a better job of giving a sense of where the action is happening. \n2. The text issues in the boxes are definitely a problem and we have some tinkering to do on that front. \n3. As far as videos go, we will add the titles. In general, the videos are not a great experience. It&#x27;s difficult to find relevant videos using the YouTube API. We are considering not using YouTube directly, but instead surfacing videos that are mentioned in tweets that are deemed relevant; they usually seem to be more relevant and raw. \n4. Being able to see who has confirmed/refuted what is definitely important and we need to make that experience better. For now, we don&#x27;t even have profile pages that let you see what someone has done. We&#x27;ll be implementing that in the next iteration.\n5. The security/spam issue is a tough one and we&#x27;ve given some thought to it, but honestly, not enough. In some ways, we wanted to prepare for it, but we also didn&#x27;t want to work on a problem that didn&#x27;t need to be solved just yet. I am sure this will be a constant battle, but as we improve both our algorithms for filtering tweets and our API security layer, hopefully we can prevent bad actors from completely overruning the site.<p>Thanks again for your thoughts.

My father-in-law and his brother were orphaned during the war and fondly remember U.S. soldiers coming to their orphanage with candies and clothes and things. It might even be possible that my father helped my father-in-law at one of those institutions. Regardless, he was helped enough so that he didn&#x27;t die of starvation or exposure and instead became an architect and helped house thousands of people in post-war South Korea, and had 5 children who&#x27;ve all gone on to be educated, successful, very productive members of society.<p>In some way, my Grandfather, who was socio-economically at the bottom of the pile, by having my father, may have helped contribute to my wife&#x27;s family in helping thousands of people put a roof over their heads and for my wife&#x27;s generation to go on to do other good things.

That&#x27;s up to the compiler to decide.</i> Undefined means <i>This is not allowed. All bets are off.</i><p>The problem is that programmers probably assume that many things which are undefined are implementation defined.<p>An example of something that is implementation defined are struct layouts: the standard (I think) does say that the order must be the same as defined in the struct definition, but it allows the implementation to put as much space as it wants inbetween those values (for optimal architecture alignment.) Things that are implementation defined are typically going to be things which must happen, but if the standard defined exactly how, it would unnecessarily constrain the implementation (such as being able to perform optimizations).",1403899347

7935256,comment,7922028,7926237,1,0,majika,,,"> 1. Inconsistent laws in a small geographical area.<p>Having different window tinting laws is a good example of the kind of baseless legal inconsistency that could harm a region&#x27;s competitiveness. If the states of a region could not come to an agreement on window tinting, it would probably damage their reputation elsewhere.<p>> In your proposed system you would have all kinds of inconsistent laws.<p>Although there&#x27;s little reason to differ on window tinting laws, I can imagine reasonable states having different opinions on, say, engine noise limits. This leads to the same kind of inconvenience, but yet is more understandable. Nonetheless, if the people of a (small) state don&#x27;t want loud engines (or perhaps they want to ban driving altogether) in their neighborhood, isn&#x27;t that their right?<p>> The only solution I see would be for all of the small governments to gather together and agree on some standard set of laws that they will all implement.<p>Right, so for any matter that calls for it, you would hope that neighboring states would be able to agree to pass identical pieces of legislation. The Australian states do this all the time (when the pre-existing law wasn&#x27;t federal).<p>> But than you are more or less back to square one.<p>No, there&#x27;s a very significant difference between a collection of autonomous states agreeing to a certain piece of legislation, and a collection of states being forced to abide by a piece of legislation passed by a federal parliament.<p>In the former, if a company wants to coerce the entire country on some political issue, it has to coerce the politicians of every single state: in a federation, it need only coerce the federal politicians.<p>If an independent state thinks a law is bad (e.g. wants to legalize marijuana), it can remove it without being beholden to outside forces. If the law was made by a federal parliament, it can only be undone by the federal parliament.<p>If an independent state thinks a program is bad (e.g. a war, a department, currency devaluation), it can remove itself (personnel/funding) on its own volition.<p>Regional agreements are <i>very</i> different to regional parliaments.<p>> This is a problem for automotive laws, food safety, building codes, etc<p>Buildings don&#x27;t tend to get up and walk into a different neighborhood. I think that if the people of a state want certain building codes (or none at all!), that&#x27;s their right. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big ask of construction companies to abide by the codes of the state they&#x27;re building in: they do that all the time today.<p>I think regional agreements could be justified for things that are inherently mobile, or that make sense to operate at scale: automotive laws, food safety laws, airport administration, public health insurance, extradition, public broadcaster funding, university funding (maybe), infrastructure (telecoms, roads, train tracks), park administration, military, ...<p>The difference here is that if some state doesn&#x27;t want to contribute to a regional health insurance fund, it doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>> 2. Large infrastructure projects<p>Right, this is harder when you have many autonomous states, but they&#x27;re still certainly doable. If there&#x27;s an imperative to do something, the states will come to agreement.<p>States that contribute to interstate highways could sell permits to their citizens as part of their car registration. There could be toll booths to sell temporary permits to non-citizens. This way, if states A, B and C want to build highways between each other, but state D, adjacent to A and B, doesn&#x27;t want to contribute, then A, B and C can fairly bill the citizens of D that end up using that highway anyway.<p>> If we were to switch to the township system, than that research would not be sponsored any more.<p>Why not? Research would only stop being sponsored by a state if the people of that state didn&#x27;t want to sponsor it. And if they don&#x27;t want to, they shouldn&#x27;t be forced to.<p>If your point is that something like the Cold War would never happen in small-state anarchy, then I concede that. But, for all the merits of the space race, it was <i>not</i> worth the risk of the Cold War.<p>By the way, check your <i>then</i>s and <i>than</i>s :)<p>> However, a State system might work. The Federal Government would be responsible for...<p>Again, it seems like you&#x27;re confounding the differences between having many independent states, and having a federation of states. My points above stand against federations (as in, federated parliaments). <i>Federations should not exist</i>: they are a remnant of a bygone era of imperialism and war-mongering. If by &quot;federal government&quot; you&#x27;re referring to agreements between <i>most</i> states to pass some legislation (e.g. open borders), then sure, I&#x27;m with you. But if you&#x27;re talking about having a legally-usurping federal parliament that is in command of the military, then I&#x27;m not.<p>Your post basically makes the point that cooperation is harder when you have more autonomous states. I agree, but I think (1) states will cooperate when there is an imperative to do so, (2) if a state doesn&#x27;t want to cooperate, then that&#x27;s their democratic right, and (3) by having the <i>choice</i> of cooperation, states can experiment, and better ideas will flourish.",1403563859

The &quot;I want to build condos so I can cash out ASAP, and then turn around and stick that money into mortgage-backed securities so I can also cash in over the long haul, perhaps at the expense of those same people I just sold a condo to&quot; money has been dominating the conversation for far too long.<p>Back in the 2000s I got kicked out of a perfectly fine apartment along with everyone else living in the building so that the property owner could flip all the units over to condos. Last I checked the building&#x27;s still at ~50% occupancy, down from 100% when I was living there.  And about half the units that are occupied are also for sale.  It&#x27;s far from the only former apartment building in that neighborhood  with a similar story to tell, either.<p>Yes, that does mean that there&#x27;s an incredible amount of vacancy in the area.  But - and this is critical - the amount of vacancy that&#x27;s a reasonable option for people who aren&#x27;t in a good position to take out a 30-year is very, very small.  If you&#x27;re in your 20s and single with no kids, a 1-bedroom apartment is a great idea. But unless you&#x27;re confident that you&#x27;ll remain single with no kids for the rest of your life, a 1-bedroom condo (that you probably won&#x27;t be allowed to sublet) is a kind of stupid idea.  And all those empty condos units are difficult to flip back to rental because condminium developments have legal encumbrances that make things more difficult.

As companies trend towards more and more technical folk at the bottom of the work pyramid (not just software engineers, but anyone doing highly technical work that increasingly incorporates ways of working that have been the status quo among developers), managers are going to need to be able to understand the technical side more and more.<p>We&#x27;ll eventually reach the point where it will no longer be enough for a developer to spend inordinate amounts of time convincing the manager what the right thing is. That works for the low hanging fruit that most developers can argue for. Once most if not all of the low hanging fruit has been picked, not picking the higher hanging fruit will be as much the fault of the manager as the engineers that need to convince the manager of their importance.<p>There will come a time where technically competent managers become a requirement, not just a luxury.",1403561150

What kind of value they derive from it (if any) is another inquiry, and can&#x27;t be discerned from merely observing the fact that they use it. At least, not without some <i>really</i> strong assumptions to the effect that people always correctly make positive-utility choices. It&#x27;s possible people use it, but derive negative utility from it, and mistakenly use it nonetheless.<p>There are some very popular things (tobacco, say) that in most reasonable analyses produce negative utility over the long run! The problem is that people are not very good at utility-maximization, especially when the analysis involves more than one factor, some uncertainty, different time scales, etc. People are generally not good at almost any vaguely arithmetically complex operation (e.g. correctly using conditional-probability information in their decision-making, even when known).<p>That&#x27;s one reason neoclassical economics prefers to talk about simply &quot;price&quot;, rather than the classical discussion of both &quot;price&quot; and &quot;value&quot;. Modern economics is the empirical study of pricing and economic behavior, and is agnostic about value.",1403561001

Here&#x27;s my perspective:<p>I think that self driving cars are coming and that. Even cars that drive on built-for-human roads are just a bridging technology. Eventually roads will be built for robocars. I think it&#x27;s a big important technology. All transport revolutions are.<p>To get on that road we need to start getting this tech into consumer land, a beachhead. I don&#x27;t know if this specific product is it, but it could be. It&#x27;s got a nice gradual path from cruise control plus to auto-drive for 80% of the ride.<p>There might be other beachheads. Long haul trucking is often mentioned. This seems like a very similar problem. They both need to deal with highway driving only. Maybe robocar friendly road networks will be extended into built up areas.<p>I&#x27;m happy to see a company take what&#x27;s working now and put it in a consumer product. We&#x27;ll see if people like it. If they do, it seems like a good a place to start developing this stuff outside of research labs.<p>edit: clarity",1403560962

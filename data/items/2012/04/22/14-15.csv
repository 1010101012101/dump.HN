Almost all ""how to avoid burnout"" advice is based on the assumption that YOU are fundamentally in control. I have yet to read the burnout story involving 3 competing jobs, 2 urgent deadlines, 1 screaming infant, a bout of flu and a sick relative. Well, sometimes you just have to knuckle down and get on with it. ""Burnout"" doesn't exist -- it's just a bunch of Stuff That Happens In Life. It's normal, it doesn't make you special, get over it, its boring.",1335106771

3874964,comment,3874735,3874735,7,0,reasonattlm,,,"This was a statistical work from data on 220,000 people in a large Australian longitudinal study, and it claims to show that sitting time correlates with increased mortality independently of level of physical activity. Some thoughts:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/04/sitting-time-correlating-with-mortality-independently-of-exercise.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/04/sitting-time-corr...</a><p>This is not the first study to propose this correlation, of course. There are a range of others from past years. One has to wonder what the mechanism is here, however - my suspicion is that it actually does all come back down to the level of physical activity in the end. In these massive studies the level of exercise and activity is reported by the participants. A person who stands and works is going to be somewhat more active than a person who sits and works, even though that time may not be categorized as physical activity, or reported differently.<p>Exercise is much like calorie restriction - the effects are so large in comparison to other factors we have easy access to that they are likely to creep into any study.<p>You might look at a recent study on activity and Alzheimer's disease that was one of the few to use measuring devices rather than reports of activity. One point that emerges is that a fair degree of ongoing low level activity and exercise won't be classified as such by the participants of study without machine measurement. Housework, taking out the trash, the small increase in energy expenditure from standing while waiting versus sitting while waiting, that sort of thing repeated day in and day out. How much you are sitting really does sound a lot like a proxy for how much activity you are undertaking when you are doing things that most people don't really count as activity.",1335106656

When you take a job, you're taking that lifestyle to boot. I remember the exact MOMENT I didn't want to do sales for the rest of my life. I was at an award conference for being in the top 5% of performers (yay me) and the discussion was on reality tv shows (oh so boring). One of the <i>managers</i> sitting across from me remarks how he's never seen most tv shows because he's worked 2nd shift for 15 years straight. It wasn't anger in his voice, or jealousy, it was simply a statement of fact.<p>Fact is, I did not want to be him working 4 - 1 for the rest of my life. Most sales jobs require odd hours, pushes on weekends, and a different skill-set than other types of jobs. No thanks, I'll take my 9-5 in exchange of other crappier hours, working on weekends, etc. You take a job, you know what effect it will have your lifestyle, that's really all I'm saying.",1335106631

Maybe, if the project is wildly successful post Kickstarter, you'll see a couple hundred dollars?<p>There are also projects on Kickstarter that will never be profitable, not because of failure but by design.

You'd be better off going on AngelList if your goal is to fund projects for high amounts of money and get a return on your investment.<p>That said, I don't think there anything explicitly stopping someone on Kickstarter from giving small amounts of equity to backers, and it might be something that people do for very high tier ($5K-$10K) reward levels.",1335106262

I know I can't pay my mortgage, take Jiu Jitsu, have the quality of life I do if I don't work hard. So my job gets me 100% 8 hours a day, for 5 days a week. It's a compromise and one I'm willing to make.<p>Working at home or on flexible schedules (and again I have a pretty flexible schedule) sounds great until you realize that teams can't collaborate together as effectively; deadlines still need to be achieved, and so on.

I don't think an equity model would serve them well in most of the markets they're working in, either; it would attract a different audience that they aren't targeting. Kickstarter is modeled off some successful crowdfunding efforts in the arts from the early 2000s, like Trent Reznor's and Radiohead's, and aims to connect <i>fans</i>, not investors, with people undertaking projects.<p>Would it really be an improvement if, instead of getting a limited-edition box set and maybe access to preview chats/etc., fans got an equity stake in Reznor's label in return for crowdfunding his next album? Do the thousands of fans who kicked in for his last crowdfunding drive even know what equity is and what to do with it? That seems like adding a huge amount of complication for something few fans actually want.",1335106213

3874911,comment,3874528,3874528,1,0,makecheck,,,"Enumerations or other constants are helpful but generally only if the type has <i>any</i> other use besides a single function call (e.g. is it a type that you'd want to store as a field in a structure somewhere, or would it be useful in 2 or 3 other routines?).  They should also be absolutely unique types (using whatever scheme in the language would guarantee that) to avoid bugs.<p>An approach that is usually better is to rename the entire function, creating two functions.  To extend the article's example, this would mean having both ""widget->repaintImmediately()"" and ""widget->repaintLater()"" (or whatever).  This can even be implemented by having both of the public routines call a single internal routine that is still parameterized.<p>When the function names are different, everything you need is in one place; you don't have to waste time figuring out where the corresponding list of allowed values is defined.  Unique functions may also require less error-handling if only some values are allowed; e.g. if the type would include ""A, B, C"" and a parameterized function wouldn't accept ""C"", it's easier to define only funcA() and funcB() and just not have funcC().  Conversely, if you some day realize you actually have more cases than you originally thought, adding a funcD() is trivial and that decision doesn't affect anything else.<p>An example of constant-parameter bugs: it's common to see someone define several unrelated values that are <i>effectively</i> all ""const int"" or strings, which allows values to be misused without warning (especially if they're named similarly).  In Cocoa, NSFontAttributeName and NSFontNameAttribute have the same type but different uses; while this isn't a true/false case it shows how easy it is for something to be wrong and how important a unique type can be for debugging.",1335105316

As most know the advantages of Unity is it's ability for delivery to a variety of platforms and rapid iteration of development. Our project will have 2 month development.<p>Our team is comprised of myself (Ex-EA, ex-Squaresoft and serial startup guy) a pair of outsourced programmers, a optimization and art integration programmer (ex-UBI) and a 3d artist. I will handle many of the art and sound tasks as well as the final call on things.<p>The budget is under $30k. I know this is doable and possible because I have a clearly defined budget, and experience to quantify this budget.<p>This game is to provide hopefully two things:\nTo quantify that a financial success can be built from this model. Positive Revenue versus Negative Revenue.\nBuild a core following of player who like our work.\nTo use the potential revenue to build a bigger project.<p>There will always be scammers and people who want to rig the system.\nI have thought closely about using KS for our second game which will require a budget of $100k, but at this time I don't have the followers and the public cred (in my mind to validate the success of a kickstarter campaign) although we do have great a prototype, art and a working business plan and design doc.\nHopfully this first game/risk will allow us to grow into what we desire as a viable business model for all involved.",1335104751

Two people can think about the same very difficult moral situation, and come up with opposite answers - each person thinks the other is a horrible amoral human being. There is no way from logic to decide who is right.<p>To go with the simplest example: abortion. Is it murder?<p>How about: is it OK to kill in self defense? What about kill 10 people to keep yourself alive? What about killing someone who is not harming you, in order to keep yourself alive? What about kill a baby to save 100 people?<p>None of these questions can be answered by thinking about them.",1226299519

That's about right but I am afraid that the lazy's are gonna miss out on the intricate command & control hierarchy of a botnet and how the researchers injected their machines within the command & control channel to effectively control a portion of the botnet. I am quite surprised about the level of sophistication these botnets are - well ... I guess that programmers in Russia are smarter than their U.S counterparts.<p>The only thing that we should be weary of (or some of us happy about) is the fact that with this paper, somebody could go ahead and employ the botnet to do their evil bidding instead of the botnet's owner's original evil bidding.

358946,comment,358490,358914,0,0,blackguardx,,,"Anyone wanting to know about electronics shouldn't start with FPGAs. I do FPGA design for a living. I wouldn't really consider it ""electronics."" It is closer to embedded programming than circuit design. To an outsider, they are almost exactly the same. Many companies lump FPGA design with firmware.<p>With FPGA design, you start with a board with an FPGA on it and then write some code in Verilog (Verilog is much easier to learn than VHDL). Once the design is complete, you hit the synthesize and place and route buttons and download the reulting file into the FPGA.<p>With embedded programming, you start with a board with a microcontroller on it and then write some code in assembly (you could also use C or something else). Once the design is complete, you hit the compile button and download the resulting file into the microcontroller.",1226298354

Of these, all but one were for male-enhancement products and the average purchase price was close to $100. Taken together, these conversions would have resulted in revenues of $2,731.88—a bit over $100 a day for the measurement period or $140 per day for periods when the campaign was active. However, our study interposed on only a small fraction of the overall Storm network — we estimate\nroughly 1.5 percent based on the fraction of worker bots we\nproxy. Thus, the total daily revenue attributable to Storm’s pharmacy campaign is likely closer to $7000 (or $9500 during periods of campaign activity). By the same logic, we estimate that Storm self-propagation campaigns can produce between 3500 and 8500 new bots per day.<p>The next obvious question is, “How much of this revenue is\nprofit”? Here things are even murkier. First, we must consider how much of the gross revenue is actually recovered on a sale. Assuming the pharmacy campaign drives traffic to an affiliate program (and there are very strong anecdotal reasons to believe this is so) then the gross revenue is likely split between the affiliate and the program (a annual net revenue of $1.75M using our previous estimate). Next, we must subtract business costs. These include a number of incidental expenses (domain registration, bullet-proof hosting fees, etc) that are basically fixed sunk costs, and the cost to distribute the spam itself.""",1226298278

358935,comment,358677,358779,0,0,thwarted,,,"I think that Hulu's interface is terrible compared to youtube.  You can't watch and browse additional videos at the same time because the page is so vertical heavy and there's a lot of wasted space (this is especially a problem when you're watching a lot of shortform stuff in series, like SNL clips).  The same set of ""popular"" items shows up at the top of every list, which only enforces the continued perpetuence of these same top items; browsing via youtube is much better.  Additionally, the page is extremely flash heavy with there being so many instances of font selection for headings (and it's inconsistent too, I notice today that some of the headings are images of Furtura, some of them are flash that render Futura).  Youtube also lets you queue up a playlist without being logged in.",1226297506

There's probably plenty of room above us.</i><p>While I don't disagree that humans are essentially at the lowest level of intelligence that make civilization possible (else why would it have taken hundreds of thousands of years to get started?), this claim has no bearing on the claim that the upper limit of intelligence is immediately above human genius level.  You seem to be assuming that there is necessarily a wide gap between the lowest civilization-producing level and the highest practical level, and that's not at all clear.  Some (weak) evidence that we're already near the top can be found in the higher incidence of mental health issues among very intelligent humans: perhaps this is a result of a limit on complexity rather than merely a feature of human brains.",1331398486

You're typically going to be valued based on how other people value you. It's why networks become so powerful (such as YC or Ron Conway). That's sometimes an effective system regarding efficiency of time (faster due diligence); and sometimes it's bogus when the reputation is wrong (either direction). Sometimes it accelerates innovation by getting the right people the right resources; sometimes it holds back innovation by ignoring potential buried under a non-existent reputation. The difference between being in one camp versus the other is often how hard (and intelligently) you work to get noticed. On the up side, once you're in, you're usually golden, the work to get noticed pays off.",1331398436

Basically things that have a clear cost and no clear benefit (or the benefit is so far down the line and so risky that it's basically a lottery ticket).<p>Sacrificing all your social life for your business... rarely pays off. If you're not mentally and socially healthy, you probably won't be building a successful business.<p>Sacrificing your career for a startup... if the startup fails, you should still be coming out of it with a stronger CV (if that's still relevant) than you went in. However you measure it, the startup should give you more than the ""I did a startup"" experience even if it fails.<p>Saying ""I don't have the time to learn X because I'm too busy doing things"" is usually a good sign that you're in a self-sacrificing mindset.<p>Taking a significant loan/mortgage to cofound your first business, with the idea that ""I'll make it back later"" - that's a self-sacrifice mindset, and likely to decrease your ""score"".<p>Pulling all nighters when working for someone else, without some very clear immediate tangible (and sufficiently valuable) benefit - typical symptom of self-sacrifice. Success-minded people will save their energy for the right kind of situation that has clear benefits to themselves as well as to their employer. Those who constantly burn themselves out may well achieve success - once they learn to stop doing that.<p>Concrete examples from my life:<p>- Staying involved full-time in a venture that I didn't believe in anymore because I felt I'd be letting my cofounder down. I don't think that did him any favours either. I should have left earlier.<p>- Going to work even though I was on strong doses of Solpadeine+Ibuprofene just to keep my 39-degree fever down (I had a tonsil infection), because ""the project needed me"" - and the same for working on that project on weekends. No positive difference made to my life 5 years later (but probably some health aftereffects waiting for me a few decades down the line).<p>- Taking on costs I didn't need to in order to ""be nice"" - generally that's rarely ever appreciated or even noticed.

Post a notice that some extra women will be needed in some areas since some Muslim female voters only identify themselves to women.<p>Step three: Public voters list that show who in the county is eligible to vote.<p>Step four: Communicate the polling day well in advance. Hire people from the local community to handle the actual taking of ballots.<p>Step five: Polling day. Starts off with every observer verifying that the serial numbered ballot box is empty. This happens for every box. Person walks in. Every observer increments the number of total people coming in. Person identifies themselves at the registration table with government ID and as a backup, utility bills or statements of note from public members for the homeless (A priest could verify that a homeless person lives in the area, for example. In some places the homeless do not even need to be verified), every observer crosses that person off their own copy of the list. If the person is a female Muslim, only women observers get to verify the identity of the voter. The voter then gets a piece of paper with the options clearly printed in large print and goes to a private place that has a poster that shows how to fill out the ballot. The voter puts an X by the person they wish to vote for. Folds the ballot and brings it to the ballot box. The observers see that the voter put the vote in the ballot box. Once the box is full, it is sealed with a tape that matches the serial number of the box and is left in open view to observers until it is time to open them and count them.<p>It is now known that how many votes is in each box, how many people voted, and the total number of votes for each candidate all with open access to Observers from the public (but more usually, the political parties).<p>How fucking complicated is that?

If the user runs firefox, safari or another browser they're still going to be susceptible to the same bug - it simply won't be attributed to the browser because the user was the one that installed the plugin. By including the plugin by default they're solving a significantly larger problem than zero days, namely users that fail to update their plugins on a timely basis (or plugins that fail to provide a reasonable upgrade path). If the security world insisted on a technical interpretation (you shipped it so it's your bug) it would be effectively discouraging a process that is net security positive - and that's the reason a distinction is made. Note that even VUPEN - whose business of selling fully weaponized exploits makes them a natural enemy of better security - tacitly admits the difference by refusing to admit the use of a flash bug. If they really considered it a non-issue they'd be freely admitting what they're exploiting. The difference?

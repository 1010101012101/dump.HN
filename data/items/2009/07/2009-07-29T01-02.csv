729291,comment,728388,728388,0,0,serhei,,,"One thing people are missing is that using bikes doubles as escalation in the arms race between Google and locals who don't want their neighborhoods to be photographed with Street View. Considering that extreme cases of the conflict included a situation where a human chain was formed to prevent the car from driving into the area, it seems remotely possible that unpleasant incidents might occur when some Neighbourhood Watch attempts increasingly hostile measures to restrain an overzealous Street View cyclist who won't listen to reason. While I don't know that the photographers' walking orders look like, it seems like most of the cases involved photographers who were being flat-out callous to the locals, making the situation more severe than necessary and giving a bad name to their company. Since Google are the people suffering the consequences and getting the resulting negative publicity, it's still Google's problem. Google's PR, of course, isn't helping the matter when they act like the locals don't have a legitimate concern in not wanting their property mapped.<p>See, I recognize the usefulness of having access to this data, but it's still personal data. It's not like it's impossible to construct a useful database of locations in a manner respectful of local residents' privacy; but unexpected issues always arise. The very mission statement of Google opens a philosophical can of worms: ""to index the world's information and make it useful"". Useful? Who to? How can you tell when making a piece of information 'useful' to one person becomes an affront to another person's human dignity? This really is a problem for which, no matter how much one tries to foresee complications, there's always some new issue popping up. Resolving the issue requires a much greater amount of accountability - accountability to the public whose information is being gathered and 'made useful' - than we can get out of Google as a publically traded corporation. Heck, it arguably requires much more accountability than we can currently get out of the United States' _democratically elected government_ (otherwise we wouldn't be worrying about things like wiretapping).<p>So certainly this Street View thing is all in the name of progress right now, but I'm not certain that it's worth the while to humanity to be able to see photos of bike paths in Google Maps before we've got some answers to the accountability question.",1248832614

How does the ""Time to Retrieve, Sort, & Present 2 Million Records"" graph look?  How about the ""Time to Modify 14% of the 2 Million Records"" graph?<p>Your append-only approach sounds great for adds.  How is it for changes and deletes?  How will garbage collection affect performance?<p>""No more locks"" is a great claim, but how will it work in a real world enterprise-quality app?  User A takes 30 seconds to change Zip Code, Phone Number, and increase Credit Limit while User B takes 10 seconds in the middle of that to change City and decrease Credit Limit for the same customer.

Quite often, some dysfunction gets explained away as a trait of being creative. Seems a bit too easy. The NYTimes writer seems to be aware of this temptation as well.<p>There are lots of other reasons to hate meetings, and not all reflect so well on the 'makers'. Many meetings just waste time, of course. But programmers sometimes do need to be dragged to a table to commit to an estimate, make some difficult decision, or justify their progress. None of which is pleasant.<p>There's a lot of empirical studies showing that interruptions are pretty damaging to knowledge workers' productivity. I don't know of any study that shows an hour-long meeting really has to mess up the rest of your day, or that one cannot focus in small time increments. I know it's harder, and that I personally find it difficult, but to me this seems to be within the scope of human possibility.

</code></pre>
* Are you sure you don't want default statusbar instead of black one? Either the blue for the nav bar or the status bar feels somewhat out of place. Maybe using a darker blue instead?<p><pre><code>  For http://www.flickr.com/photos/39014474@N04/3765806150/ (Members)
</code></pre>
* Are the phone/message/chat icons on the right side big enough to tap on without accidentally hitting the wrong one? And how does it work if you have two contacts in the same group? Might get a bit cluttered. If it works out, awesome. I do like how it looks and having the options available right away.<p>* Is anything going to be placed underneath the person's name? Right now it's just white space; Maybe place the person's last status update or location down there?<p>* Would tapping on a member bring up their profile?<p><pre><code>  For http://www.flickr.com/photos/39014474@N04/3765010947/ (Live Map)
</code></pre>
* I know you say what the arrows do, but its not immediately obvious by looking at them. And what's the member info do?<p>* Does this only show one member at a time? Or if there are multiple people from your group in the same location, would it show them as well (with a blue pin?)?<p><pre><code>  For http://www.flickr.com/photos/39014474@N04/3765010909/ (Chat)
</code></pre>
* Does the tabbar show the number of unread messages you have? Can you be in multiple rooms or private chats with people?<p>* The curve around the input field feels wrong.<p>* How does it look with multiple people when the window is filled? Might get or feel cluttered.<p><pre><code>  For http://www.flickr.com/photos/39014474@N04/3765805994/ (Msg Board)
</code></pre>
* Again, the curve feels slightly off here.<p>* Can you use / instead of .'s between dates? It might be ISO 8601 compliant (I don't know if it is or not), but it looks weird.<p>* Can you post videos?<p>* What distinguishes this from Chat? Why not merge the two and keep some sort of history recorded? Yes, one's live and one's a record, but they serve an almost identical purpose.<p><pre><code>  For http://www.flickr.com/photos/39014474@N04/3765010849/ (Home)

* Whats the difference between the slightly faded group and the non-faded groups?<p>* I like the indicator for how many messages you have waiting to be read and how many people are in the app and active, but it might be a bit small.

More criminals means more people in prison.<p>The American legal system is like the bad parent who alternates between being over-lenient and being violently strict.  Much of the time policing is actually far too lax.  Most people selling drugs are never caught, most gang killings are never tracked down, and most home burglars are never captured.  This lax policing allows too much crime, and eventually the police are forced to react.  They do so in a blunt and ham-fisted manner.  Cops break into the wrong homes in an attempt to make headline grabbing drug busts.<p>Think of it in terms of math: which has a higher prisoner population, the country that catches the perpetrator of 98% of crimes, or the country that catches perpertrators only 10% of the time?  The answer is the second country has a much higher criminal population.  The lower probability of getting caught increases the amount of crime, which means total jail population is much higher.<p>Asian countries like Singapore and China on the other hand are the consistently stern parent.  In Singapore there is a 99% chance of getting caught if you murdered someone.  Thus there are virtually no murders, and a very small prisoner population.<p>Both sides of the law and order debate need to realize that American law enforcement is simultaneously <i>too tax and too heavy handed</i>.  This is not a contradiction, its the reality.<p>Many American cities (Philadelphia, Baltimore) have homicide rates that have been unseen in Western civilization since medieval times.  This is a huge problem.  It needs to be addressed.  Any proposed reform that tries to lower police abuse without also lowering the crime rate will result in failure ( and by increasing crime, will in the long term actually increase police abuses).",1248830217

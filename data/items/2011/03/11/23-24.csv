Combine the quote I referenced above with ""it's good and healthy and productive for us to like to play computer games"".<p>Its just a reckless way to say 'we all waste time..' - not without making the distinction of the need for self-discipline and noting that there are some people that are very prone to addiction.  I have an extended family member who's life outside of games has been completely destroyed by a sustained addiction to video games.  He has stated repeatedly that he would rather be dead than give up gaming.<p>This is a real problem for a percentage of the population, and that percentage is increasing as video games are being engineered to be more and more addictive.",1299887988

The internet infrastructure is relatively immune to earthquakes, by weight mostly cables and UPS's  and it's quite widely distributed.  In spite of appearances earthquake damage can be quite localized.  I lived about a dozen miles noth of Loma Prieta and suffered no damage.  SF and Oakland were another 30 miles to the north.<p>The internet was designed to survive all kinds of damage.  Larger companies usually have multiple data centers and colos so they can continue operations.<p>When the big one hits SF, I will probably have to walk a dozen miles to my car.  Then I drive home 200 miles south, plug in to the Internet, and see what I just went through.<p>EDIT:  I expect to survive because of tough CA building codes and decades of seismic retrofits.  My homes survived two 6.5-7.0 earthquakes, because one of the first things I did  after moving in was to make sure of the basics, like foundation ties and reinforced cripple walls.",1299887907

I am a libertarian (small l) because it is the only political philosophy which honestly wants to reduce the size of the government. I also want to bring awareness to people that the use of the law is the use of violence and that we should be aware that when make new laws, we understand that we are advocating violence against those who don't comply. For example, do we really want to arrest and lock someone in jail when they refuse to wear a seat belt and don't pay the fine or when they smoke a cigarette in a bar? Is that what we've become?

I won't go into detail, but having done some research I've seen there's noone else doing this, and I think it's a product which can be widely used.<p>The problem is, I don't have the skills to make it. It'd include quite a lot of features, most of which would have to be custom-made, in languages I don't speak. So I have a few options:<p>-Just doing it, and seeing where it ends. Problem is that I don't have much time, and I'm already trying to get more skills in another language.<p>-Find a more technical co-founder. I'm just afraid, wouldn't this completely sideline me? I mean, I have clear ideas about what I want and stuff, but as long as the product is being developed all I could do is ask the co-founder how it's going, and giving some of my input. I'm afraid it'd feel like it's not my thing anymore. Also, I feel unsuitable for the business-side of things. No experience, still very young, nowhere near any kind of scene.<p>-Just throw the idea out there for anyone who wants to use it, and move on to something which suits better. I'd feel like I throw away a great idea, and not only that, it's <i>my</i> idea.<p>Any idea what I should or shouldn't do?",1299884887

The larger problem here, the elephant in the room perhaps, is the notion of someone ""owning"" a name or word, combined with the fact that two or more people can simulateously or independently decide they both want to use that name. One party might be the first to create a Twitter account with it. Another party might be the first to create a Facebook page. Another to create a domain name. Another to write song with that title. Another to write a book or story with that title. Another to release a code project with that name. And so on. Inevitably, there will be conflicts. It sucks, but until/unless we have some central globally-unique-and-authoritative Registry of Names For Anything Anywhere with clear written rules, then, this is just going to keep on happening and happening.<p>Me?

If twitter already provides the top 5 twitter clients, and 90% of users interact with twitter through those clients, where's the fractured landscape and user confusion coming from?<p>And if the organic trend is towards official twitter client adoption, why are they taking the risk of coming out and bitching at developers to stop making clients?  Everyone already noticed the market for these sorts of apps drying up, and has started wondering how serious twitter actually is about keeping a robust 3rd-party platform for the long haul.  This just adds fuel to that fire, for no gain whatsoever.<p>I get what their goal is.  They're positioning to make a serious push to get ads/promoted tweets/etc in users' faces, and they want everything in place to be able to shut down or prevent the 3rd party clients that pop up to filter all that out.  Okay, fine.  But why make the big announcement like this?  Why explicitly freak out all of your developers while you're still on a trajectory of solving the problem organically?  Why not wait until it's actually a problem, when you're actually seeing increased adoption of 3rd-party clients that ruin your plans?<p>It's always interesting to watch a company work hard to solve a problem they perceive from their perspective that's completely at odds with the problem the rest of us see from ours.

I've loved reading your articles and essays about startups, and I've soaked up all of it, but one of your big topics is dealing with investors. I've talked with a lot of entrepreneurs, and bootstrapping seems to slow things down slightly, but with the technology available as cheaply as it is, living expenses are the biggest thing, and if people can figure out how to live on the margin, they could launch a startup on next to no money at all.",1229050592

395259,comment,394882,395085,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Note that I said that the functionality was ""Tivo-Like.""  No streaming is necessary!<p>You have content organized in ""channels.""  You start out with very small resolution and short streaming ""previews.""  But once you subscribe to a ""channel"" the application starts downloading longer Bittorrent ""episodes"" from torrents that are posted to an RSS feed.  So there is an initial period when people only have access to ""previews,"" but after the first night, it really is like a Tivo for short high-quality porn clips.<p>With Bittorrent, much of the bandwidth is provided by the P2P cloud.  The bandwidth costs are for initial seeding and for the shorter, smaller ""previews.""<p>So really, the two keys to this idea are:<p><pre><code>    1) Packaging - the easy place to find high quality clips\n    2) The users bring their own bandwidth\n</code></pre>\nI know that when I watch a porn DVD, what I'm really doing is going to my favorite one or two clips in the chapters menu.  It's like in the old days when you had to buy the whole CD just to get the 1 or 2 tracks you really loved.  I suspect that the market for really good, really short clips can come into being.  Once one site shows that money can be made this way, then a lot of the high-quality free short clips will shift their availability to such pay channels, just like the shift from Napster to iTunes.",1229049492

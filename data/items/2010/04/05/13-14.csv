Racism can be a trivial by-product of natural or culturally inculcated xenophobic tendencies and shortcuts taken by our brain when processing complex social information.

In Smalltalk, I can edit a method in the debugger and throw away the top part of the stack and restart in the current context yet only rarely deal with side effects.  Granted, this is probably not good enough for something like a VOIP sever process relying on shared nothing assumptions for a robust concurrent architecture, but this may be one of the reasons that many OO programmers aren't eager to make the leap.<p>(Similar to explaining the utility of unhampered closures to some Python programmers: you can do a whole lot even with Python's limited blocks.

1241813,comment,1239815,1241620,0,0,elblanco,,,"No, not at all.<p>I think this is an incredible interesting, and often overlooked subject. I've even seen hashes that resolve collisions by sticking tries in the slots instead of linked lists for chaining. That way the ""I'm checking for a collision"" operation part of the hash becomes ""give me the memory location 100% of the time I want"". It essentially eliminates hash collisions in the classic sense, and the tries in the hash slots usually don't get very big/you can delay resizing the hash for quite a while (just use a different method like when the first trie hold more than n strings).<p>Some of the optimizations you mention make a lot of sense and I was generally responding with the more naive variations of the two concepts. One thing to keep in mind is that tries grow in memory amazingly fast. So fast that the rest of your system will have to start swapping out just to keep the trie in memory. A list of a quarter million tokens, average length of 6 will probably eat about 300-400MB before optimizations. If you restrict the tree depth to 4 or so, and stick hashes on the end, you can keep it around ~100MB. But a quarter million tokens is not really all that much, real life applications will usually involve millions of token. And a naive trie will rapidly outgrow the memory on 32-bit systems. It's the classic tradeoff, memory for speed. However, hashes are not really all that bad speed-wise. So the tradeoff isn't quite as good as one might hope. If you have to go to a trie from a hash to eek out an extra few percentage points in performance, you're likely having bigger problems.<p>In practice I've actually only used a trie a couple of times over a hash. Mostly because in the applications I'm using, I never have to grow the hash which is the most expensive hash operation. But also because there are already so many very good hash libraries in most languages particularly persistent hashes which can be <i>very</i> memory efficient. The practical different in speed between the two is really not that noticeable for most applications unless you are doing billions of lookups a day (in which case you probably are looking for a different setup anyway involving some kind of database).",1270473518

1241811,comment,1240887,1240887,0,0,btilly,,,"Quantitative data time.<p>In research quoted in <i>Software Estimation</i> by Steve McConnell, for completing a medium sized project (in that research defined as 10,000 to 100,000 lines of code) there was a local minimum of calendar time with teams of 5-8 people.  To reach that level of calendar time again you needed a team of at least 20 people.  However there is reason to believe that 50,000 lines of code delivered by 20 people will have more duplication of effort and less quality than the same delivered by 5.  Which makes the relative productivity of the small team even better.<p>The reason is simple.  The natural loose and open structure of a small team breaks down if the team is too big.  Depending on the specific people, it tends to happen somewhere in the range of 6-9 people.  Past that you have to manage lines of communication carefully, which results in process and overhead with reduced productivity.<p>The lesson to draw from this is the following.  If you want the project delivered as cheaply as possible, let one programmer work as long as it takes.  If you need it delivered quickly you can increase team size to 5-8 people.  If you need stuff delivered faster than that you'd better swallow hard, accept a several-fold increase in costs, start hiring, and do careful planning because you'll need it.<p>(You can pass the small team limit in practice by having different teams on different pieces of software.  But they had better be really different.  When people have to interact closely, they are part of the same team no matter what the org chart says.)",1270473463

The degree of musical talent required to be a professional musician is <i>widespread</i>.  The bar is really pretty low.  Basically, if you can play in rhythm, in tune, in the right key, with a modicum of feeling, you can get paid for playing music.  This squares with the distribution of musicians in the pre-phonograph United States.

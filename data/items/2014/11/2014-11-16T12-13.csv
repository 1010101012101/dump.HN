Tried another with that previous doctor and got orthostatic hypotension, then with this doctor tried an anticonvulsant, which I had to stop because of bad skin side effects (still have little bright red flecks on my skin here and there).  At that point, especially with the very slow ramp up of the anticonvulsant (meaning for a long while I didn&#x27;t have a therapeutic dose), we crossed our fingers and stopped trying mood stabilizers, which lead to the change in diagnosis.  (Elsewhere in this topic I mention how I later started taking a low dose of another antipsychotic to deal with anxiety in general, with very useful side effects for insomnia and allergies.)<p>I did name one drug name because if any other atypical anti-psychotic will do the trick it should perhaps be tried, Zyprexa is pretty infamous for weight gain among other things.",1416142314

But when it doesn&#x27;t work right you will go crazy trying to work out why.<p>To be good with JavaScript you need a rather substantial and solid grasp of CS fundamentals and how they are implemented in languages that are stricter about what they will accept and how.<p>In JavaScript there are too many situations where it either does something totally unexpected (well actually totally logical, but you need to know some pretty arcane stuff to see it that way) or it just fails silently or less likely with a terse exception.<p>For a beginning programmer that is very little feedback to help with overcoming the initial roadblock. Sometimes called the &quot;getting helloworld to run problem&quot;.  Trying to learn JS in a browser context is made even more difficult because you need to grapple with the DOM - it is not easy to grok at the best of times.<p>If you decide to ignore the advice in this and the other posts and go ahead learning JavaScript as the first language, then I suggest getting a very good introductory book and perhaps using Developer JavaScript Console.  The debugger is good in that you can single step code and watch variables as they change.  You will probably need to take copious notes to understand what is going on.<p>To be a competent programmer is more than learning a language, it requires a solid foundation in computer science and software engineering.

I hope to think they&#x27;re a small minority of people but it&#x27;s amazing how many women they&#x27;ve tried to turn off tech with their idiocy, their defamation, their death threats and their abuse.<p>When I see what happens to women in tech and a lot of the abuse they have to withstand, I admire those that can stand the trolls. I don&#x27;t think I would be this resilient faced with this abuse.<p>I wish we could be in a world where everybody would be accepted in the tech community regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. I hoped before that due to the relatively higher education level of tech workers, people would be more tolerant but it seems that&#x27;s not the case.<p>PS: Now, in the case of weev and his AT & T conviction, I of course support reversing it and support the work that EFF is doing defending him but that&#x27;s despite weev. It&#x27;s because, in this particular issue, he&#x27;s innocent. That doesn&#x27;t stop him from being an horrible person.",1416139372

Snowden clearly didn&#x27;t have time to look at what the documents he spidered actually say.<p>2) Xkeyscore is merely a database and does not constitute new surveillance. Snowden&#x27;s documents show that it contains fewer sources under Obama (no more email metadata).<p>3) The NSA significantly <i>reduced</i> the scope of its upstream collection under Obama in April 2012. <a href=""http://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc0912.pdf&ved=0CB4QFjAB&usg=AFQjCNHOnLiH-z9ZCtai5B8Py1RnXu0rcQ&sig2=mxzyVWOwvKtNKaPJFzpycQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc0912.pdf&ved=0CB4QFjA...</a><p>4) A datacenter does not constitute new surveillance, whether it&#x27;s built or not (not).<p>5) Your article says that Obama&#x27;s DOJ found pre-Obama abuses, once again, the exact opposite of what you claim. Your claim that Obama lied about taking steps to fix this are unsupported by any of your links. Simply stating something does not make it so.<p>6) There is no proof that the overflights are recording data from anybody other than the targets. You&#x27;re engaging in wild speculation here.<p>7) According to my link above, this claim is false. The NSA shut down any ability to assist in parallel reconstruction with upstream data in 2012.<p>8) There is no 8.<p>9) Again, false. No journalist has ever been prosecuted (or persecuted) with the espionage Act. <a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2013/06/24/journalists-and-the-espionage-act-prosecution-risk-is-remote-but-real/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2013/06/24/journalis...</a><p>10) More unsourced claims.

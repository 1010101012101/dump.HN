1128474,comment,1128320,1128386,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"Hmm, except the oligarchy aspect at the end, I thought the analysis was cogent enough.  I liked his points about the bailouts being a wealth transfer to baby boomers in particular. It basically boils down to a few claims. For why Greece is not the loser:<p>* A decrease in the amount our government is able to borrow will not hurt us very much. (This jives with your claim that Greece squandered the money lent to them.)<p>* Investors have short memories. They'll be knocking at our door again soon enough.<p>For why either baby boomers or the current generation do stand to lose:<p>* Bailouts represent a wealth transfer from the current generation, who will pay for them over time in taxes, to the baby boomers, whose investments are the ones being bailed out.<p>I'm not sure if his claims were about who was the problem so much as a pragmatic analysis of who stands to lose. I've always thought that when bankruptcy and default are options, the debtor is in fact the one that holds the power in the lender-lendee relationship, and this situation seems to lend credence to that view.",1266302192

This was mostly quick and dirty stuff I hacked together and could certainly be improved.  The 'noise' doesn't seem to bother me though and helps me compare them visually, could be a personal preference thing.<p>On the SEO use of subdomains, do you have any links I could read more on that?  Anecdotally, my experience seems to be otherwise but I could be wrong.<p>Agreed that the blog needs better maintaining.  I'm more focused on my personal blog to do much with it.  I've tried getting some tutors to contribute with mixed results.  I haven't had much luck with the quality of articles when hiring someone to write, so not sure of the ROI on that.  If anyone has ideas would love to hear it.<p>On that A/B test, funny you mention that because I tried almost that exact thing you suggested when 37Signals came out with Haystack.com (now Sortfolio.com), where I made the free tutor account permanent and the paid account got you top placement in search results, highlighted listing, and a 'PRO' badge next to your name.  I didn't run it long enough to have 100% confidence but the conversion rate dropped compared to what I have now (first 3 job requests are free, then you must upgrade if you want to continue).  I still feel like the biz model could be improved though.  If you have other ideas on this would love to hear it.  Thanks again!

1128463,comment,1128125,1128125,0,0,tumult,,,"Rather than the physical hardware of the touchscreen accuracy, nobody seems to be commenting on the software accuracy and, more importantly, latency.<p>Android is much less responsive (yes, even on my Nexus One) than any iPhone model. This is not something people tend to measure, but it matters more than I can tell you. When your only feedback from the device consists of visual cues, it's really important to get them to the user as fast as possible. When the lag time between touch<->visual response is long, you end up performing everything more slowly overall, and the feeling of 'sluggishness' of the device increases, even if it really is doing things faster.<p>For example, my Nexus One can scroll and render a web page faster than my iPhone 3GS, but in my informal tests, it lags nearly 3x over iPhone when responding to actually moving the page with your finger (iPhone is less than 100ms, Nexus One/Android 2.1 usually over a third of a second by my crappy measurements, don't take it as hard fact. Try it yourself!) As a result, the Nexus One feels like more of a PITA to use, and I am subtly more frustrated when performing any task in the OS in any app.<p>This stuff adds up. Google needs to pay attention. Normal users cannot even tell you what is wrong when it comes to something like this -- a focus group or study will not help. People cannot tell you ""oh, the touch sensing was too latent, so my actions were slowed and I was more frustrated while operating the device."" They will just be frustrated in some other way that you cannot correlate to touch latency, or they will say nothing, because the problem is not something they can articulate.<p>The first OS update for my Nexus One added a bug where the desktop wallpaper becomes misaligned when you return to the home screen after launching an app from anywhere but the center home screen. After doing so, when you touch to begin swiping to another home screen, the wallpaper jumps into the correct place by several hundred pixels. Very jarring. This happens every single time, and it wasn't present in the version that was on the phone when I took it out of the box. How did nobody at Google see this before they released the update? Do they not have humans testing the software they're working on?<p>When you drag down the notification panel from the top of the screen, the bar jumps by about 30-50px every time when initially pulling it out with your finger. Every time.<p>I want Android to be successful. Please, Google, pay attention to this stuff.",1266301504

1128457,comment,1128360,1128360,0,0,tsally,,,"It is interesting that Clay Shirky (the presenter that the article is based on) reverses the usual roles of capitalized and uncapitalized nouns.  Capitalization denotes importance or emphasis and it is strange that emphasis would be put on the work you do you your boss instead of on the work you feel is important.  The standard advocated by Shirky becomes even stranger when put into a different context.  Students produce art all the time but most would be hesitant to call any of the pieces save a few Art.<p>This divergence suggests a few interesting hypotheses.  First, the author values Work more and is attempting to understand work from an outsider's perspective.  Second, coming from the perspective of Work leads to inaccuracies in Shirky's point of view.  The accuracy of claim that ""Work drives the economy"" is not so clear.  It could be argued that all Work trickles down from the work of company founders.  Indeed this is why many companies get started; the founders have work that they want to do, they have something they think is important and worth doing.<p>In closing, I will suggest that Shirky and the author of this article are approaching the problem from the wrong direction.  Respectively, they are attempting how to translate Work -> work and Usability -> usability.  The author of the article wants to know how to ""make and evaluate that miracle motivational leap"" from something with no motivation to something that generates motivation.  But when you are working on something with no motivation, you're already dead in the water.  Far more productive to start with the motivation and try to figure out how to turn your intellectual itch into wealth.  If you're creating a product, start with something users want, don't try and create the motivation after the fact.<p>Note: I've made several conjectures about Shirky and the author of the article based on limited information (I can't find a video or slides of the keynote).  It's important to remember that I'm just speculating.  It's entirely possible I'm misrepresenting Shirky's true point of view.  What I wrote is only accurate based on the information from the article.",1266301211

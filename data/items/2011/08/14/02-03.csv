If what you are doing is meaningless for humanity or detrimental (for the sake of the example, let's say your work is on anti personnel mines), but that you find a great fulfillment in doing that, good for you!<p>I have always thought very disturbing in the occidental culture the notion that there are ""unworthy"" occupations, and some people ""waste their life"" doing something different that they could in someone else's opinion.<p>But that's just applying peer pressure to make such people comply to our (skewed?) visions of how life should be, and when failing, using guilt to try to destroy the joy they find in doing what they do the way they do.<p>Maybe because I grew up watching too much anime and reading too many mangas I admire whatever people are, in any field, trying to remove my own bias.<p>Like - you don't have to be a Nazi to admire what Roemmel (sp?) did in north-africa. A true military genius of the time. Or how a handfull of guys armed with box cutters social-engineered they way to massive destruction and terror. And also it's hard not to admire the beautiful job of some people in charity work - eradicting polio, wow. Using cellphones to develop microcredit and banking in countries with little infrastructure - that's beautiful!<p>But unlike you, I would but the fun part above the ""important"" part, because what's important is a personal opinion. If someone find something important, it's important.<p>If designing and testing landmines aimed at killing and maiming people is fun because, I don't know, the mathematical challenge behind it, the noise of explosions, whatever - it's a worthy endeavour. If you make good money because you're good at the job you love, even better.<p>BTW the knife cut both ways -  my training has been mostly on the medical field, but someday I realised the humanitarian field no longer meant anything to me. I'm not feeling any greater purpose or anything, and I don't believe I ever did. Maybe I tried to fool myself thinking I did. Maybe I resent the fact that's it's difficult to match up my skills to what's usefull in the industry, but I doub thatt and I don't think it's clouding my judgement too much. Anyway it is just no longer fun and that's what matters.<p>I don't feel bad about that. It's not good or bad - just an indication that's it's time to do something else now, and that as usual change is hard. If I listened to what people would think about my move, I'd up for one another good guilt trip :-) Like why don't I go to some poor country to save people? Because I don't care, don't see the point, and while the visiting part might be fun initially, it would be boring and I may not like the food and the culture :-)<p>What I fear is many people are doing this for a time in their life - sometimes their whole life - without realizing how empty it is, until it bites them back, a la Lars Von Triers' ""Dogville"".<p>Maybe I grew out of the guilt trip that's forcing of lot of people into such training and studies. I'm just sad to see such post and comment, including people downvoting the not politically correct things to say.<p>Do what you like, and figure out justifications later.<p>PS: You don't have to spend 8 hours a day working on something BTW - slavery is gone is most part of the world. Economic slavery however remains, and if you want more things than you can affort, yes, you will have to spend your time this way, and might resent it.<p>Some people, mostly in europe, figure out how to strech their money and benefits to live without doing any purposeful work. I would find that sad - unless they enjoy the ""game"" part of gaming and abusing the system. In that case maybe a worthy endeavour to them, rest of mankind be damned.",1313290577

Are you likewise surprised by the fact that people don't like the guy who comes up to the bowl labeled ""Free Candy"" and takes all of the candy, leaving none for anyone else? ""But I'm just demonstrating that any system based on goodwill is open to abuse!"" Well, yeah. We know. People hate that.<p>I should say I'm more surprised at the magnitude and nature of the outrage. There's lots of thoughtful commentary, but at the same time, I've read lots of blind hatred towards Sam. The community around Jonathan's Card appear to be outraged and are touting their moral superiority over Odio. He may have been a dick, but to me, it appears like so many were acting as if Jonathan's Card was their only act of goodwill  - and many were acting like this was going to benefit those in need (debatable). Sam said it was about 'yuppies buying other yuppies coffee.' He was pointing out an issue that other people who were taking advantage of the cards were not doing. Unfortunately he chose to game the system.<p>The Jonathan's Card experiment is not over, and what people do next is the critical result of the experiment.",1313290556

2882633,comment,2882356,2882614,2,0,Mz,,,"My estimate is that the US currently spends roughly $3 Billion (with a B) on medical care for a mere 30,000 people with CF.  This is mostly covered by insurance, state aid, federal aid, and charities.  The families are typically under enormous financial stress and can ill afford to spend money on some risky unproven source of advice, which is the category my experiences fall into.  I think it's very repeatable and people who have chosen to act on even limited bits of my advice have reported very good results.  I have so far not had anyone tell me ""I tried that and it so failed"".  Given the degree to which I am routinely vilified by the CF community (for advocating ""dangerous"" things like eating better), I strongly suspect if there were any significant failures of my approach, I would never hear the end of it.<p>The fundamental problem appears to be that people define CF in the following manner (quote from a doctor): ""People like you don't get well.""  Since I got well, I must be lying. I can't really have CF.<p>I have no plans to charge money for information.  I have no idea how it would be monetized.  I generally assume I am better off pursuing other things for money and keeping this fairly low on the radar.  Attempts to shout it from the rooftops has only served to convince people in the CF that I am a liar, a charlatan and a snake oil salesman -- that I suffer from Munchhausen Syndrome and am doing this out of a sick need for attention rather than a sincere desire to help other people like me.<p>Anyway, there is a link to my site in my profile. It's the one with the word ""health"" in the URL. :-)  I have no idea how that $3 billion could be tapped into to support a saner, more humane and cheaper treatment approach.  God knows I would be on it in a heartbeat if I could figure that out as I have a pile of debts from getting myself well.<p>Peace.",1313290399

Everybody is angry from time to time. Also other feelings like fear, frustration and psychological sickness might make you act violent or make you feel that hitting and killing other people is not an act of violence. But other factors are important. One is, that you can picture (meaning have the clear idea) of hurting someone and the barrier that stops you from executing this picture, which is made of empathy (""you are like me, I should not hurt you"") and moral/ethics, which are an artificial created result of society. Based on this I feel that violent computer games really increased my chance of one day hurting other people. On one side, when I am angry with other people, I can picture more clearly how I want to hurt them and which tools might be useful for that purpose. Without my ""experience"" from movies and c.games I might have to think more clearly, how to efficiently apply pain to other people. I have more clear ideas then ""take something hard and attack, when totally in rage"". Also I feel that my barrier is lowered through these impressions. If I often watch this kind of movie and play this kind of game, the ""experience"" itself becomes more of a daily experience and less something being special and disgusting.<p>Maybe I am just not mentally healthy or the one in a million who reacts this way to computer games.

It rarely gets updated.  I still hope this will change someday.  I also keep my toe in on a list or two.  I believe firmly that if you want to see less crime, fewer people in prison and so on, you should put more societal resources into supporting families and helping people be good parents and helping kids get raised right.  I think every little bit helps in this regard.  So I continue to be a resource, on a small scale, for folks who have very challenging children.<p>I also run a health site.  I have a form of cystic fibrosis, as does my oldest son.  I have figured out how to get us well.  I share that info to the best of my ability, in spite of huge negative reactions from the CF community.  My thought is that I would like to write a game (aka simulation) to better share my understanding of what works.  My approach is a diet and lifestyle approach which flies in the face of what most people know to be true about this deadly condition. I do not want to do this as a charity.  Yet I can't do it as a traditional business model.  Maybe something like a freemium model will work.  I'm not sure.<p>I'm pretty disillusioned and disenchanted with the charity model.  It tends to fundamentally assume that people cannot help themselves.  I think this tends to cause big problems and you need to be very, very careful about such underlying assumptions. I have overcome some very serious personal problems.  In the course of doing so, I have routinely run into ""helpers"" who had to be ditched at some point -- even if they were professionals.  It is standard modus operandi of most such people to want to help you walk better but not want you to stand entirely on your own two feet because then they have no role in life as someone's crutch.  My experience has been that such people have an enormous need to be needed and can't imagine anyone would genuinely ""love"" them or befriend them as an equal.  It speaks simultaneously of both phenomenal arrogance (often rooted in being much more competent than average) and phenomenal insecurity (often rooted in having been given hell socially for most of their lives, in part for the crime of being too competent).<p>I would like to see the world be a better place.  I consider that to be a form of selfishness:  If the world is a better place, I get to live in a better place.  I see no reason why a charity model is fundamentally superior to a business model for achieving such a goal.  I see lots of cases where a charity model is part of the problem.  One notable ""exception"" is Habitat for Humanity. Please note they are not really a charity per se:  They do not give away houses for nothing.  They sell the houses and recipients have to also provide labor beforehand.  They just a) don't sell at a profit b) due to volunteer labor and donated supplies, not selling at a profit means selling a house for substantially less than it is typically worth on the open market and c) they don't charge interest on the loan. This combo makes the loan payments dramatically less than house payments typically are.<p>Anyway, those are my rambling thoughts while exhausted and foolishly posting anyway.<p>Peace.",1313287867

Each term like this adds another point at which your equation can change direction. It works because abs() is maths equivalent to the if-else  with enough convolutions, you can make equations conditional on almost anything. However, I think with this technique, you have to change parts of previous terms to account for the new term  I havent figured out how yet.<p> Add ksin(99x) to your equation to give yourself a beam k high.<p>I'm tempted to write a program that can create an equation of piecewise line segments to fire.

I'm infinitely more interested in SwipeGood than I am in Zynga. But everyone makes their own choices. Some people just aren't that concerned with injustice. Some people may have the same goals you do, and try a different path; nonprofits/NGOs always have good intentions, but not always good results (have you ever tried fundraising? it's not any easier than just making money.) And finally, it's a heck of a lot harder to fix injustices than add happiness. It's harder to scale, too. Much easier to build that photo sharing startup and be happy. :)<p>You should figure out what exactly you want to do. Injustice is too broad. Pick something and start there. You can try to pick something where you think you'll have ""the greatest impact"", but it's a) impossible to predict, and b) it's better long-term if it's something you're passionate about and won't burn out on.<p>Khan Academy, Kiva, DonorsChoose, and Samasource are nonprofits that are popular/well-known in the tech/startup world.

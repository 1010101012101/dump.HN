I don't know how I feel about it, I'll reserve that kind of thing for the experts. It's certainly refreshing.<p>I see they've also created depth by having certain object scroll slower (or less.) Further removing the boundaries.

They use an achievement system quite like what you describe.<p>Ask them how they think it works, and whether their traffic would be the same if they removed the feature, etc. More data is great, because the argument doesn't catch my eye right now.<p>I've used a couple services with badges like that, but I've always ended up finding it stupid after not too long. You might end up accidentally alienating people who just want to use a service without feeling like it's a competition. Once I started associating a useful service with the time wastingness of a game, I started reevaluating whether I really wanted to use the service after all.

1126778,comment,1126363,1126707,0,0,patio11,,,"At the bottom it is a marketing problem.  See, if you describe global warming as a robust ongoing academic debate, then when you start proposing seriously expensive regulations to take it on, the opposing party will say ""Whoa, whoa -- all of these impressive PhDs think it isn't really happening, so how about we wait a while to see how things shake out and save the money?""<p>So the decision was made that the robust academic debate couldn't be allowed to exist, because that would provide cover to The Bad Guys (TM).  Thus there needed to be a Consensus on climate, something which could be referred to as the authoritative Voice of Science.  It needed to be international, both because science is international and because a major portion of the intended office of the argument keeps offices in Europe as opposed to America.  (Global warming is pretty much a dead letter elsewhere else: Africa is too poor to care, China and India are getting too rich on high-polluting industries to care about the issue except to the extent it allows them to wring concessions out of the First World, etc)  Hence, the IPCC.<p>Now, the IPCC doesn't matter two hills of beans for science.  The papers say what they say.  But the IPCC, as the official Voice of Science, has quite a bit of sway in corridors of power, such as European governments and your local newspaper's editorial board.  The ready made The Science Is Settled narrative worked at what it was supposed to do: marginalized as ""deniers"" and deviants anyone who questioned The Science, and paved the way for expensive interventions against climate change.<p>The problem with marketing, though, is that eventually you have to deliver on what you're selling...  and delivering on infallibility is pretty hard.  Perhaps recognizing this, some scientists (like the illustrious Phil Jones, climatology heavyweight and editor of a section in the last IPCC report) have gone to some lengths to avoid being seen as losing on issues of fairly minor import.<p>And, as so often happens, it turns out the coverup did more damage than the original lapse.  I mean, paleoclimatology: hard to understand.  Statistics behind hockey sticks: hard to understand.  Impropriety of deleting data to avoid other scientists from seeing it: not too hard to understand.",1266248718

The fact that they are doing it out of ignorance makes it understandable but it doesn't make it right.</i><p>Ok right, but you still won't acknowledge the fact that from a moral perspective, their conscience is entirely clear.  Put on their glasses for a moment.  Why?  As you just stated, <i>their own ignorance</i> aka a <i>lack of knowledge</i> is the reason why.

1126757,comment,1126421,1126421,0,0,kordless,,,"The title of this post should be ""The problem with DNS"".  It's really the lack of mapping the root domain to a CNAME that is the issue.<p>Amazon chose to do load balancing with layer 4, no sessions, and using low TTLs on CNAME records.  This minimal feature set allows them to make the service highly scalable and fault tolerant.  Add more features, and it could become brittle.<p>If you build your app or site around naked domains, expect layer 7 support, or want session persistence, ELB isn't going to work for you very well.  On the other hand, if you build around the set of features they provide, it's likely to be exactly what you need.<p>Of course this leaves the issue with someone typing in your naked domain and getting redirected.  I'd point out that this can be solved by using an elastic (static) IP and always making sure you have that IP address up on a box.  If it's not mapped (and monitoring fails) then bring up a new box and assign it to that box.  Only do 302s on that box to keep things simple.<p>Alternately you could use something like UltraDNS, which will monitor boxes for you, and switchero DNS on failures.",1266248201

Underreporting might explain some of this apparent decrease, too.

As long as the student is good and ready, and some students become good and ready despite K-12 school rather than because of it, the students can be admitted. Homeschoolers have been getting into great colleges<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><p>for a long time.<p>AFTER EDIT: I should, of course, acknowledge that a desire for money and power can shape policy in these matters. And I will give an example from my own community. My state has had for more than twenty years a Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) program,<p><a href=""http://www.ohe.state.mn.us/mPg.cfm?pageID=797"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohe.state.mn.us/mPg.cfm?pageID=797</a><p>the first statewide program of its kind in the United States, and my son's ""eleventh grade"" and ""twelfth grade"" curriculum consisted largely of courses taken at our state's flagship university. As I type this, he has applications in process at several out of state universities, having already been admitted to two of those (and also the state flagship university) before the turn of the year.<p>A decade ago, my local public school district predicted that its enrollment in the district's sole high school would increase so much that the high school building would have to be rebuilt, at great expense. During public meetings about that proposal, I asked if the district had done an analysis to see if providing incentives for students to sign up for PSEO classes at various nearby local colleges would be more or less expensive than rebuilding the high school building. The school district officials said, just as the Utah school officials quoted in the submitted article said, that students shouldn't be pushed out of high school. But if students are still in a learning environment, and taxpayers save money by having students study where they are most challenged and engaged, what is the problem? Oh, the school district doubtless noticed that state funding of education follows the student (it does so in Minnesota perhaps more equally than in any other state, by a reform from the 1970s called the ""Minnesota Miracle""), so if students are studying elsewhere, the district's empire shrinks.<p>A decade later, we look back on history. The first proposal to rebuild the district high school, including HUGE expenditures for ""technology"" (probably old-fashioned LAN cables and other things that didn't make sense to any taxpayer with technical employment) was defeated by a voter referendum. A new-and-improved, still quite expensive, subsequent rebuilding project was approved, and all of us here are still paying the increased taxes incurred by that project. But the predicted increase in local public high school enrollment never happened to the degree predicted--instead several privately operated schools in our area report booming enrollments, and have had to expand their buildings. Having dollars follow students is a wonderful idea. Locking in dollars for bureaucracies is not good value for taxpayers.",1266247359

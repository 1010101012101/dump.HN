It's supposed to be a compromise between ""no IP"" (where IP is copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc...) and some sort of permanent and ironclad possession of works and ideas.  I believe the balance has tilted too far in favor of the producers of IP, and that it should be shifted back the other way, but not eliminated.<p>In a more general sense, the problem is ""provisioning of public goods"":<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good</a><p>Creating property where none naturally exists is one solution, but there are others (some good, some bad, depends on the type of good).",1212483565

I don't see myself ever seeking political office or even employment again, and I don't have any hopes of making money from my personal blog. I just write what interests me.<p>I'll take the always perfect as a compliment though. Also, do you only read the entries posted here?",1212482300

It's more likely that you don't, as is evidenced by the quite engaging discussions this site is historically known for; discussions being engaging precisely because people don't agree by default. Perhaps instead of steering the conversation you should take part in it. For instance, you could render your opinions about copyright law instead of your opinions about people that write about copyright law.",1212482099
207756,comment,207440,207707,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think the one we have now is doing a fantastic job. The record labels are failing miserably to adapt to the new reality, but that has nothing to do with the copyright system. It's with their own disincentives to adapt (a complex subject I will talk about tangentially soon).<p>I think the current copyright situation lets citizens do pretty much whatever they want and prevents corporations from infringing on creators and IP owners. That, to me, is perfect.<p>Corporations, for their part, went a little further than they had to with the DRM (which had nothing to do with our copyright system) and are finally starting to come to their senses.<p>I'd say the whole thing is working very well.",1212482023

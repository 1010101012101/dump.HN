It would certainly be possible to pass laws that <i>decrease</i> tax revenue (just reduce all taxes by 90% across the board). I would guess that this &quot;trend&quot; (untrend?) is at least partly due to the fact that those changes to tax law weren&#x27;t random, but were passed by politicians who were reacting to contemporary conditions (both economic and political).<p>It&#x27;s like observing that a driver keeps adjusting the gas pedal but their speed never changes and concluding that it&#x27;s not possible to change a car&#x27;s speed using the gas pedal.

To be precise, there are two &quot;shapes&quot; of &quot;electromagnetic fields&quot;: curl-free (electric (unless magnetic monopoles exist)) and divergence-free (magnetic or electric), and each kind of field lends itself to a different kind of degree of symmetry in a confinement mechanism. Specifically, a divergence-free field cannot admit a spherical confinement because of Green&#x27;s theorem, whereas a curl-free field requires a very unrealistic charge configuration to generate a toroidal confinement.<p>Tokamaks use a combination of divergence-free magnetic fields and divergence-free electric fields to make a donut. Stellarators use only magnetic fields to make a twisted donut. The polywell uses curl-free electric fields generated by an electron gun to make a sphere. There are other variants of inertial electrostatic confinement fusion, including that currently under development by Lockheed Martin, but it&#x27;s generally received less attention.",1454824089

Then I instrumented various parts of the code related to the temperature measurement algorithm to see the earliest point where it was corrupted. I traced it to the interrupt routine that reads the temperature sensor. In investigating that code I modified it slightly which caused the problem to disappear. Experimenting showed that a particular instruction would be the source of the problem.

The traditional way of doing things you&#x27;ve described involves multiple different applications connecting to the database. Data access is restricted by locking their database users down to specific APIs exposed by stored procedures. Non-trivial logic lives in the database in order to present these APIs.<p>A lot of systems lately are being built in a different way, that is, only one application connects to the database. This application presents an API (ReST, protobufs, thrift) for other apps that need that data. It handles access control and business logic, using the DB as a backing store. That means you don&#x27;t have to worry about dababase user access control, because you don&#x27;t have more than one user.<p>I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about either of these, but the latter way of working is how we do things at my current job (reasonably large payments software company), and it does work quite well.

Be it Everquest, Ultima Online, Runescape or WoW, it seems no other genre in video gaming elicits such fondness, or reaches immersion levels so deep as the MMORPG. The immense potential in having a virtual, persistent world inhabited by tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions of people, with the virtually inexhaustible possibilities of gameplay that arise from people inhabiting a shared, persistent world, make the MMORPG the king in this department: immersion and fan dedication.<p>Yet it seems that this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore, that the cosy world of Ultima Online or Runescape 2006ish doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. MMORPGs have found it more profitable to engage in a variety of design choices that, ultimately, destroyed what MMOs were about. The open endedness of Ultima Online, the thoughtfulness and deep worldbuilding of quests in Everquest, the charming aesthetics that left just the right amount to imagination, just like a book, of Runescape, all that was replaced by high action, cheap thrills, and a lot of shiny particle effects everywhere (and of course microtransactions, because why not).

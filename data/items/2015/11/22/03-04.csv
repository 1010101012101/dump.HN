A guy/gal who spent a decade or two dealing with RPG on a 400 will have judgments contextually relevant to that technology environment.  His experience and judgments will have limited applicability to say microservice based architectures on AWS.  Yes there will be some generalities that will apply everywhere, but probably not enough to make up for the deficiencies of limited experiences outside of that 400 comfort zone.  In fact, some of that prior experience may well prove harmful rather than beneficial in a different environment with different strengths and weaknesses.<p>Unfortunately technology is unlike some professions like, say, warehouse management or construction where techniques evolve with time, but there are more commonalities from one decade to the next.  Technology sees highly disruptive change and so I would still argue that without keeping current in your knowledge, your experience has a very short half-life.",1448164660

Instead, we made a loss on every customer due to the discount, while Groupon made their commission (25% of the list price if I recall correctly) whatever happened. Making excessive money while your clients lose money is not a viable business model. So we dropped them, as many others did, and they moved on until they finally ran out of victims. If I recall correctly, the second time we tried, they changed the contract percentages on us without informing us, similar to the story another business owner tells in a comment on the Medium post: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1SRjksX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1SRjksX</a>",1448162960

From The German Ideology, part I, section A (Marx, 1845):<p>&quot;This “alienation” (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. For it to become an “intolerable” power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity “propertyless,” and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the “propertyless” mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, (1) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism.&quot;<p>Basically his assumption was that it will never be possible or politically tenable under capitalism to change the system to channel enough capital back to the general population (e.g. lets say via taxes to fund basic income to a level equivalent to lost incomes) to allow people to continue to consume enough to allow manufacturers to continue to grow, and that the result would be ever greater cycles of economic crashes until the contradiction of capacity to create wealth coupled with unemployment and/or underpayment gets great enough to cause people to rise up against it.",1448161660

Generalising from the limitations of Docker to all container implementations is unfair (compare Garden, for example); and the Docker team are slowly coming around to heed the voices of their critics.<p>Unikernels mostly still require per-stack implementation. That&#x27;s a lot of engineering effort right now. There are halfway-houses like OSv (mentioned in the slides), but they weaken the case.<p>I&#x27;m still bullish on Unikernels. With some work Garden&#x27;s API could be adapted to run unikernel binaries. That means the ecosystem for Cloud Foundry would work almost &quot;out of the box&quot;, as it already does for Garden droplets, Docker containers and .NET applications.",1448161235

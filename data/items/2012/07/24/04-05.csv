Once one of these monolithic companies controls your identity they can then directly target you no matter where you are on the internet.

Even if the result were the same. Experimental treatments are experimental for a reason. In fact, many of our treatments for cancer, including chemotherapy and radiation, are all poisons designed to kill the cancer before it kills you. Introducing a poison into a patient's body in the hope that, if you survive, you'll stop the cancer's progress is really the rule more than the exception in modern cancer treatment.<p>We really don't have anything better.",1343105942

Anywhere from a nice lunch at a fancy restaurant, to a few days off.  I've even dangled a team building movie matinee.  I've never found cash to be a real big motivator.<p>My 2 simple rules for crunch mode:<p>1. Manager better be there.  Me personally, i would dive in and actually start doing code reviews.  But even if I had absolutely nothing to add, I had to be there to show support.  Even for window dressing.  You call for crunch mode, you better be present.

They write an app, it fails, and they move on, but instead of a situation where the surviving app makers can now raise their prices due to scarcity, instead the people who left are replaced my someone else who tries to do the same thing. The end result is that no one can raise their prices, because the instant they do, some college kid comes along and does the same thing for $1. And of course the acquisitions of instagram and Sparrow make this even worse, because now there are 10 times more college kids thinking they're going to make $1b by making an app and getting acquired.<p>Of course, the key to being able to charge a premium comes down to marketing, and positioning yourself well in the market, but that's obviously not a fairly difficult thing to do, especially in these competitive markets.",1343103526

However...<p>> Is there any mathematics on defining what % of the dataset should be training vs. testing or is it left to the analyst (like with confidence intervals (95% hypothesis testing etc.))?<p>Indeed there is - the proper name for the statistical technique is ""cross-validation"" and much work has been done on the matter. The most common way to do it is ""k-fold cross validation"", which, when k=2 simply means to split your data in half randomly and use one for training and one for test - basically what the author did. The generalized k-fold cross-validation means that you slice up your data into k subsets, pick one to use as a test set and use the rest as a training set. Then repeat the process (""folding"") k times, picking a different test set every time and averaging the results. This, of course, takes longer, but it has a better gut feel because your algorithm is ""learning"" from <i>all</i> the data rather than just whatever slice you originally chose as your training set. Wikipedia lists a few more common ways to do it:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#Common_types_of_cross-validation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#C...</a><p>However, since the author's process involves tuning parameters <i>after</i> testing the algorithm against the test set, I'm not really sure how cross-validation would work... Maybe standard k-fold with three sets instead of two - a training set, an intermediate test set, and a true test set?",1343102642

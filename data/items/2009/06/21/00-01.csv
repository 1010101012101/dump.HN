I've been pretty heavily involved with the development process by helping to determine, prioritize, and test features. I have no financial involvement, however. All my work and hype are small tributes to the awesome archievement that is TextMate. I feel blessed to be able to help it gain traction</i>",1245545867

Same layout as the M.<p>I cleaned and even repaired it, supergluing the rubber thingies back onto the membranes. I also had to solder some wires back on.<p>I'm running it off a PS2/USB adapter for my Linux laptop and I can easily reach 100 WPM on this.",1245545551
666999,comment,666698,666931,0,0,gojomo,,,"Bradbury has had a distrust of the purely-virtual forever. Check out, for example, his 1951 short story ""The Veldt"" from ""The Illustrated Man"" collection. (You can find the story text online or easily read in a library or bookstore -- it's only 19 paperback pages.)<p>Also from 1951, check out the story ""The Pedestrian"".<p>Because written text is still so important in our online communications -- TV hasn't become the final media -- the future isn't quite as he'd feared. But there's still wisdom in his warnings.<p>In particular, watch out for anyone who says, ""Now that we have the Kindle, we can use all these old books as kindling!""",1245545411

666994,comment,666809,666892,0,0,chaosmachine,,,"After using the same IBM keyboard for 12 years, I'm also now using one of those thin Apple keyboards.<p>The Apple keyboard is very fast. Less distance to push keys down means more keystrokes in less time. On the other hand, I find it harder to hit the keys dead center.<p>I probably wouldn't go back, but there's room for improvement.",1245544629
666993,comment,666809,666809,0,0,bbgun,,,"I bought one of these model M keyboards out of pure nostalgia. It is superbly built and I love the sound of the keys. However, by today's standards it's an ergonomic disaster, as it forces you to rotate your wrists to an uncomfortable degree. And I quickly tired of how much pressure it takes to depress the keys. My new favorite keyboard in the world is the aluminum beauty that came with my iMac. Oh well.",1245544569

I think it's a slap in the face of all the people Erik bullied and abused over the years to punish someone for speaking out on their behalf.<p>With regard to me ""seeking help"": were you consciously quoting Erik's post, or was that a matter of unconscious irony?",1245544335
666990,comment,666809,666809,0,0,astine,,,"I don't understand what the problem with 'dome' keyboards is. I've used the same standard one for years, and it hasn't failed on me yet. I rarely mistype, and when I do, it isn't because didn't feel the keypress. Sure, I could probably break it over my knee, but it's light and if someone had to subject it to that kind of abuse it would mean they were doing something wrong.",1245544260

666987,comment,666809,666809,0,0,akamaka,,,"Yes, absolutely the best keyboard ever.  I'm still using mine to this day, and it works as well as it did in 1991 when my older brother bought it with his 286.<p>Nothing I've tried comes close (although I have tried those high end M-inspired keyboard they make today).  There are some disadvantages, like not having the command key when I VNC into my Mac box, but I can live with that.<p>I've spilled juice on the keyboard twice, short circuiting the electronics, and crashing my PC.  But after opening it up and drying it off, it was as good as new.<p>I have some RSI problems as well, and they're entirely caused by use of the mouse and other keyboards (especially recent Mac keyboard), but the symptoms go away quickly when I'm back on the model M.<p>As long as I can get my hands on a working model, I'll be using one!!

Is there a company out there that specifically does this?  I've search around and can't seem to find what I'm looking for.<p>I could setup Nexus and Hudson, but I don't have any extra machines.

666982,comment,666471,666823,0,0,robotrout,,,"I asked them on their forum, a few months ago, this exact question.  Below is their response...<p>With the DAT file [from Maxmind], you cannot do grouping (group by city,region,country), select IP by country (where country_code = 'US'), modify the data (eg : change country code from ISO to FIPS standard), join with other SQL tables and you can only do queries one at a time... Some people might not have access to the server (eg shared hosting) and the MySQL DB could be the only way they can install it. Also, some develloper might prefer using the data in a MySQL format because thats what the application they are running is using.<p>There is a few extras such as IP CIDR by country and I might add timezone soon.",1245543338

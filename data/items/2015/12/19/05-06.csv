We love the provocation of thought that seeing really good art achieves. I&#x27;ve gotten fairly good at interpreting art. On occasion I&#x27;ve even been called an artist, though I personally don&#x27;t consider myself one, for a variety of reasons, but mostly due to motivation.<p>All that is to say, I&#x27;m not your typical suburban luddite who signs off on abstractionism as just &quot;squiggly lines anyone could do&quot;.<p>But lately I have to stop and consider that maybe fine art is less relevant today because fine artists are less relevant. I mean, it&#x27;s not exactly like the latest artists have anything particularly new or surprising for artists to say. For example, &quot;End War&quot; is a popular topic. Way to go out on a limb there, buddy.<p>Our post-post-modern era of art is just <i>boring</i>.<p>And it&#x27;s not just boring. It&#x27;s increasingly rather shoddy work, too. Where some artists have attempted to cross disciplines and bring new ideas into the academic art sphere, it&#x27;s significantly devoid of any meaning, derivative, and poor imitations of the forms they are copying. You can apparently get really far in art school if you can find some corner of culture that your Baby Boomer art professors haven&#x27;t seen and pass off your tutorial sessions as &quot;new&quot;.<p>For example: while visiting my sister in Des Moines, Iowa, we visited the local Des Moines Art Center. All told, an absolutely fine museum of modern art. There was a wide selection of different pieces from both artists I recognized and ones I didn&#x27;t yet know. But there was one piece that really stuck in my craw.<p>&quot;Icon&quot; by Rashaad Newsome (<a href=""http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/exhibitions/singlechannel5-Rashaad-Newsome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/exhibitions/singlechannel5...</a>) is a wanton appropriation of 90s-era demoscene visuals with poorly choreographed dance sequences unconvincingly greenscreened on top. Content-wise, it&#x27;s exactly the sort of thing you&#x27;d expect an art-school sophomore to make.<p>Now, to some extent, better visuals in 3D graphics aren&#x27;t exactly at the disposal of anyone who isn&#x27;t specifically making a career out of 3D graphics. I&#x27;d not be able to make much better, and I studied computer graphics as a concentration in my computer science degree 10 years ago.<p>But that&#x27;s rather much the point. Modern art museums are not supposed to be the refrigerator door of art school iconoclasts looking for a pat on the back. The cubists weren&#x27;t <i>bad</i> painters. They were specifically playing with representation and form. You can see it in the confidence of their lines, in their cohesion of their color choices. They had spent years studying painting to gain the fine motor control and insight to forge a new path.<p>Not flat-textured quads that you could learn how to make in your first hour of playing with THREE.js.<p>You have to do something with what you&#x27;re making. You have to use every detail of your piece. There has to be intention. It&#x27;s not so much that the visuals were poor. It&#x27;s that they weren&#x27;t the point of the piece. There was no part of the piece that relied on the fact that the visuals were poor. They were a distraction from whatever else was trying to be made.<p>This is just the freshest example I have in mind. Hell, I even was hired to build a piece for an artist once[0]. I hated the piece I made. I thought I did a poor job, all my seams were showing and joints weren&#x27;t aligned properly. I did the best I could in the time and budget, and the artist was more than satisfied. She received high praise for her show. But to me, it was a bad piece, because I didn&#x27;t do what I thought was a particularly good job in making it.<p>[0] No, I don&#x27;t understand how it makes sense for an artist to pass off another person&#x27;s work in their own show, but apparently it&#x27;s a real thing and she paid me for it anyway. This is why I don&#x27;t consider myself an artist. I don&#x27;t understand how the &quot;aht&quot; world works. There is an unspoken code for how things work. And apparently, the feeling is mutual, hence why I finished college with a computer science degree, rather than the fine art degree I had been accepted for.",1450504734

Passenger airlines in developed countries often aim to have an average fleet age younger than that, but the planes are built to fly for 20, 30, 40 years and sometimes more.<p>And remember that the maintenance procedures, mandated by law, for commercial aircraft are kind of insane. The analogy to a car (since everything has to have an analogy to a car) would be:<p>Every time you&#x27;re about to get in the car and drive somewhere, first you do a full walk-around inspection of the exterior, then inspect all the lights, vents, wipers, horn, and so on. If anything is in less than perfect condition, you don&#x27;t drive the car until it&#x27;s been fixed.<p>Every ten days, you drop the car off overnight at a garage. They do a full fluid check, tire check and rotation, alignment, lubricate everything, and if they find anything less than perfect it gets fixed before driving again.<p>Once a month, oil change, filters replaced, new battery. If there&#x27;s visible wear on the tires, replace them.<p>Every two years or so, you pull out the engine and replace it.<p>Every five years, you have the car completely disassembled and reassembled, replacing any part that&#x27;s even the slightest bit worn or fatigued or shows any detectable amount of corrosion.<p>If you maintained a car this way, the car would last damn near forever. This <i>is</i> how planes are maintained, and is why they last as long as they do.",1450504441

10762790,comment,10760084,10762696,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> And now you&#x27;re moving the discussion between having KNOWLEDGE, and having TECHNOLOGY. Those are, in fact, different things.<p>That is, in a nutshell, the difference between 20 years ago and today. They used to be different. Now they are not. Having the technology eventually exposes you to the knowledge. Knowledge now is completely free if you live in the US, because of free access to technology. Between Wikipedia, Craigslist, various social media outlets, there is no way you can be on the Internet today and not find what you are looking for, if it&#x27;s important to you, eventually. Very much not the case in the 90s.<p>This has a direct effect on the experience of being poor.<p>> Is he really THAT much better off with an XBox One today?<p>Yes, because society was that much worse 20 years ago. What you were escaping was that much more awful.<p>> Rich in 1995 ain&#x27;t too shabby. In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much better than poor in 2015.<p>I would rather be 30 and poor today, than 30 and rich in the 80s. You may disagree, but I was not very well off not that many years ago, and I was able to leapfrog what would have been decades of hustling to get where I am now, because of advantages that I wouldn&#x27;t have had 30 years ago.<p>You&#x27;re right, 30 and rich in the 80s isn&#x27;t too shabby. But that would mean that I would have 30 fewer years of life in today&#x27;s world. You&#x27;re completely discounting the value of time and over-valuing money. 30 years is an unimaginably enormous amount of time. I can get 100x the value of my time out of a year here than I could have with any amount of resources in the 80s. If I chose to be 30 and rich in 1985, that means I would be in my sixties today. Being young in today&#x27;s world is worth, to me, any amount of money you can name.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the fact that things we find totally boring today were fine luxuries in the Middle Ages. Chairs were the domain of the medieval super-rich at one point in time. The conversation we are having right now likely could not have existed 30 years ago.",1450504306

If you look at x-ray telescopes such as Chandra or XMM-Newton you&#x27;ll notice they have extremely long, very high aspect ratio mirrors.

At high enough energies you can use particle physics equipment because gamma rays will produce electron-positron pairs on impact (allowing you to then track their trajectories and work backwards to determine the direction of the gamma rays).

7209665,comment,7205385,7205385,1,0,runawaybottle,,,"The one thing a lot of people really miss when talking about education is proper motivation. Believe it or not, it is not natural to want to know what the &#x27;sort&#x27; function does. Even the most curious, smart individuals may ponder for a moment the implications of not knowing what that black-box function is doing, but very few are compelled to start digging.<p>And really, what&#x27;s so bad about that? If the sort function solves your problem, then guess what, you just solved your problem. Now, next week when they plug in some new sets of numbers and their program breaks, they&#x27;ll have to figure out what the hell the sort function actually does. Then two weeks later when they need to plug in large data sets, and the program takes days to run, they&#x27;ll need to investigate better algorithms, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s called classic problem solving, and it doesn&#x27;t get nearly the credit it deserves. It provides proper motivation (not forced motivation, or misguided motivation). One is not simply compelled to ask &quot;Are there more or less efficient ways to sort numbers?&quot;. There must always be a reason.<p>Lastly, what is academias obsession with berating professional coders?<p>>I learned the BASIC and Pascal languages at school. Who uses those now? No one. Learning to code an iPhone or Android app is great fun - but in 10 years time when those children are adults, the world will have moved on and Objective C will be yet another obsolete language.<p>Let&#x27;s just ignore the implied purity of the former two languages mentioned, but Objective C is used to program for the most popular phone the world has ever seen. You average kid grew up with one of these things, it&#x27;s very natural to want to make something for it. This attitude is really unfortunate. People that go from zero to making shippable apps are pretty awesome, it takes a lot of effort to persistently learn (by yourself!). What makes it worse is that the computer scientist and the coder who wants to solve/ship something are trying to solve two completely different problems. There is no reason for this kind patronizing.",1392018161

7209663,comment,7207348,7209599,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> What it does suggest is that per capita energy consumption rises more slowly as a function of wealth than one would expect based on your assumptions about increasing use of resources, and that over time, the per capita energy consumption for some fixed level of wealth will get smaller.<p>I am not sure that works in practice unless one has a lot of resources going to enforce property rights over intangible assets, and unless those rights are the only growth one expects in the economy.  The fact is, I may download and play a computer game as a factor of what you call &quot;wealth&quot; (not my definition btw), but as soon as I want to do anything(like go to the store to buy groceries), I have to use energy and materials to do that.<p>Similarly for the video game developer, the FTC regulator, or anyone else possibly involved, to show up to work you have the same questions of materials and energy.  What you end up with instead is greater demand for less and less <i>useful</i> products because <i>good materials</i> become more and more expensive.  That sounds like inflation to me, not an increase in wealth.  I think we are already heading down that spiral.<p>As for a definition of wealth, this may seem old fashioned, but I will paraphrase one of the more insightful definitions I have read:<p>Humans are dependent on material culture since we can&#x27;t live without clothing or shelter, and tend to have to prepare food in some way.  Wealth at its core is a desirable modification to goods and materials in our environment.  Wealth is created when we modify something to make it more useful.<p>0.025% annual growth is still exponential.  You can&#x27;t demand a constant rate of compounding rate of growth without the problem that this demands exhausting all natural resources.",1392018147

7209630,comment,7209440,7209440,25,0,higherpurpose,,,"Jacob Appelbaum has been saying this for a while already. They use NSA&#x27;s data to do &quot;signature strikes&quot;, i.e. strikes where they may assassinate someone only based on the &quot;harmless metadata&quot; they have on him. Talked to someone who may have talked to someone else from a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;? Well, you may now be on a drone target list.<p>This is going to get exponentially worse as they move to automated drone assassinations, where they just create an &quot;algorithm&quot; that&#x27;s supposed to decide who is going to die next.<p>This is going to be their next logical conclusion, and to them it&#x27;s &quot;inevitable&quot;. Of course, it will be done in secret, too, probably for years before there are even leaks about it. Going by how &quot;accurate&quot; their algorithms are for determining who&#x27;s American and who&#x27;s not (there has to be only a 51 percent chance, which is almost like flipping a coin on whether someone is American or not), I imagine this algorithm on who to kill will be pretty loose, too. Better safe and kill more innocent people, than sorry and not kill the right target, is what they will choose for that algorithm.<p>You could say the rules for killing are already very loose right now, but the killing itself is done manually, and they are somewhat restricted to how many people they can hire for this. Once it&#x27;s automated, expect the assassinations to rise by an order of magnitude, because it will just be &quot;so easy&quot;, and also sending a drone should become much cheaper in 10 years.<p>Drone assassination defenders have been saying &quot;but would it be any different if they just sent some guy with an F-16 in there to attack the target?&quot;. Well, even if such an attack wouldn&#x27;t be anymore precise and it would still kill a lot of innocent people in <i>that</i> strike, the difference between killing people like that and killing them with automated drones or even manual ones, is about as big as spying on highly expensive targets, and doing &quot;mass collections on everyone&quot;. It becomes so easy and so cheap technologically, that their rules for doing that action become radically more loose.<p>Just as for spying, they will do it simply because they can. Instead of attacking Osama&#x27;s #2 with an air strike, they will be attacking a lot more people who are just very remotely associated with an organization, and in many of these cases, the decision to kill will be done by loose understanding of what is a target from the NSA mass spying (whether it&#x27;s the understanding of the people deciding the drone targets now, or the algorithm for the automated drones in the future).<p>Recommended watching: Daniel Suarez on automated killer robots:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMYYx_im5QI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMYYx_im5QI</a>",1392017241

This post --itself pretty damn long-- is basically pulling out the most appalling pieces regarding Greenwald&#x27;s JSOC source and the source&#x27;s statements regarding the drone program.<p>Also, make sure you don&#x27;t say No Such Agency or type their acronym. Wouldn&#x27;t want the article to get censored and fall off the front page. Moving on...<p>><i>According to a former drone operator for the military’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) who also worked with the [No Such Agency], the agency often identifies targets based on controversial metadata analysis and cell-phone tracking technologies. Rather than confirming a target’s identity with operatives or informants on the ground, the CIA or the U.S. military then orders a strike based on the activity and location of the mobile phone a person is believed to be using.</i><p>What could possibly go wrong? What might the enemy do upon figuring this out? Well, it&#x27;s clear that our own operatives understood the problem:<p>><i>One problem, he explains, is that targets are increasingly aware of the [No Such Agency]’s reliance on geolocating, and have moved to thwart the tactic. Some have as many as 16 different SIM cards associated with their identity within the High Value Target system. Others, unaware that their mobile phone is being targeted, lend their phone, with the SIM card in it, to friends, children, spouses and family members.</i><p>So... why are we still doing it? Is there a way that this might become at least a bit more reliable?<p>><i>What’s more, he adds, the [No Such Agency] often locates drone targets by analyzing the activity of a SIM card, rather than the actual content of the calls. Based on his experience, he has come to believe that the drone program amounts to little more than death by unreliable metadata.</i><p>You&#x27;ve got to be shitting me. The source continues later in the article:<p>><i>The former JSOC drone operator estimates that the overwhelming majority of high-value target operations he worked on in Afghanistan relied on signals intelligence, known as SIGINT, based on the [No Such Agency]’s phone-tracking technology.</i><p>><i>“Everything they turned into a kinetic strike or a night raid was almost 90 percent that,” he says. “You could tell, because you’d go back to the mission reports and it will say ‘this mission was triggered by SIGINT,’ which means it was triggered by a geolocation cell.”</i><p>And the source does at least concede that the [No Such Agency] builds a matrix of characteristics to try and pin down a target:<p>><i>In fact, as the former JSOC drone operator recounts, tracking people by metadata and then killing them by SIM card is inherently flawed. The [No Such Agency] “will develop a pattern,” he says, “where they understand that this is what this person’s voice sounds like, this is who his friends are, this is who his commander is, this is who his subordinates are. And they put them into a matrix. But it’s not always correct. There’s a lot of human error in that.”</i><p>I&#x27;m sure this is what the president meant by &quot;near-certainty&quot; of a target&#x27;s validity:<p>><i>In his speech at the National Defense University last May, President Obama declared that “before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured – the highest standard we can set.” He added that, “by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life.”</i><p>The highest standard we can set:<p>><i>As of May 2013, according to the former drone operator, President Obama had cleared 16 people in Yemen and five in Somalia for targeting in strikes. Before a strike is green-lit, he says, there must be at least two sources of intelligence. The problem is that both of those sources often involve [No Such Agency]-supplied data, rather than human intelligence (HUMINT).</i><p>A high standard indeed. But don&#x27;t worry! The [No Such Agency] insists that HUMINT is involved. After the fact:<p>><i>Hayden felt free, however, to note the role that human intelligence plays after a deadly strike occurs. “After any use of targeted lethal force, when there are indications that civilian deaths may have occurred, intelligence analysts draw on a large body of information – including human intelligence, signals intelligence, media reports, and surveillance footage – to help us make informed determinations about whether civilians were in fact killed or injured.”</i><p>==============================================<p>There&#x27;s also some nice tidbits about the technical manner in which this is pulled off. The GILGAMESH program is described:<p>><i>As the former JSOC drone operator describes – and as classified documents obtained from Snowden confirm – the [No Such Agency] doesn’t just locate the cell phones of terror suspects by intercepting communications from cell phone towers and Internet service providers. The agency also equips drones and other aircraft with devices known as “virtual base-tower transceivers” – creating, in effect, a fake cell phone tower that can force a targeted person’s device to lock onto the [No Such Agency]’s receiver without their knowledge.</i><p>As well as the SHENANIGANS program:<p>><i>In addition to the GILGAMESH system used by JSOC, the CIA uses a similar [No Such Agency] platform known as SHENANIGANS. The operation – previously undisclosed – utilizes a pod on aircraft that vacuums up massive amounts of data from any wireless routers, computers, smart phones or other electronic devices that are within range.</i><p>><i>VICTORYDANCE, he [different operator from an [No Such Agency] doc, not the JSOC source] adds, “mapped the Wi-Fi fingerprint of nearly every major town in Yemen.”</i>",1392017162

What if we were on the cusp of recovery anyway and we had spent 5 years building railroad and machinery rather than tanks and bombs?  The end result would have been a more efficient application of industry over time, resulting in a more abundant society, right?<p>But I can't say that was the case, would have been the case, any more than you can say the opposite, because we don't know what would have happened if we had tweaked x or y, and can't test it.  That's why economics is a social science, not a science.  That's why economists are still arguing over what caused the great depression, as well as what ended it.",1223722442
329634,comment,329062,329591,0,0,tdavis,,,"Indeed. I live in a fantasy world where people who ""report the news"" do so in a manner where only facts are presented and any opinions or analyses are backed up by trustworthy, informed, unbiased sources. I realize that world doesn't exist, but that doesn't mean I won't stop berating those who create ""news"" for this one.<p>Sadly, your point is an oft-relevant one so my only recourse is to read TC even less than I do now, which is to say stop reading the articles that show up here.",1223721515

329629,comment,329451,329615,0,0,trezor,,,"I think the point is more that starting up a traditional business involves much higher costs, effort and risks versus setting up some website or web-service, which pretty much any Joe Schmuck can do these days.<p>And I completely agree with him. I realize I might be pissing against the wind, with the ""startup""-focus on hacker news and all, but lots of these so-called startups I see here, I would consider spare-time hobby <i>projects</i>, and even if they find a way to capitalize on them, I still wouldn't call it a full business.<p>If your business can be summarized as a server, located in some data-center somewhere, working out the stuff on its own, calling it a full fledged <i>business</i> is a bit over the top no matter how much time you spent writing the initial code.",1223720857
329628,comment,329336,329336,0,0,albertcardona,,,"""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""<p>--- Frank Herbert, Dune - Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear",1223720856

329626,comment,329616,329616,0,0,mixmax,,,"It's a slippery slope - it certainly helps getting users to join, but it has implications on privacy and trust. That being said I think that most users will probably see it as a service and not a threat. The thing to notice here is that YC users and techies see the problems with this approach, but normal users don't. They just see the service, not the implications of it. So if you don't abuse it I think there are certainly cases where it makes sense to do.",1223720679
329625,comment,329451,329615,0,0,trapper,,,"Well, if you don't make money it's not a business, its a hobby in my opinion. I have hobbies that I put my time, effort and money into, but I certainly don't classify them as startups. Thousands do this for open source & freeware projects, it doesn't mean they are startups either.<p>I know it's not the popular opinion, but making money is important, and having a plan to make money & testing it before you launch is a critical part of a business. Perhaps it's one thing people will learn, that a project isn't a business until you have paying customers.<p>Getting bought may not be a viable business model anymore, if it ever was.",1223720613

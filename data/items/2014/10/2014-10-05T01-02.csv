There are no truly static languages, except maybe perhaps static macro languages like C++&#x27;s STL.<p>> In both cases you also need to perform additional checks, and in both cases, safety critical systems should be formally verified. Not &quot;instead&quot;, but &quot;in addition to&quot;.<p>In practice, there are a lot of other things going on in Haskell that work against formal verification in safety critical real time systems. When you need to know for sure, non-determinism (say in the form of lazy evaluation) is your enemy, and the type system itself becomes less useful because those paths have to be rigorously explored anyhow.

The block chain is limited to about 7 transactions per second, and every node has a full copy of the block chain, so traffic goes up roughly as the square of usage.  There&#x27;s a minimum fee for each transaction (if you want it confirmed in any reasonable length of time) and it&#x27;s currently about $0.30. That&#x27;s more than many merchants pay to process a credit card transaction.<p>Nor can Bitcoin handle fast payments. It takes about an hour to get solid confirmation of a transaction, by which time the price of Bitcoins may have changed substantially.  If you&#x27;re selling anything that actually costs you money, you have to wait for some confirmations. One gambling site tried accepting unconfirmed transactions. People would bet, then, if they lost, double-spend to kill the payment.<p>A distributed digital currency without these problems is technically possible.

I worked for 2Yrs in an MNC and started a startup one year back in my town Kochi, India. We started with a product for indian commodity market which got an award from govt of India, It was an OpenData project. We just did it as a hobby project, to learn how to do things, We didn&#x27;t have a monetization plan for that, It was later when we got a call from WORLDBANK, saying that they would be interested in funding us if we are going ahead with OpenData or Govt related projects, But we turned them down as we didn&#x27;t plan to continue with OpenData projects.\nWe where bootstrapped by then, so we started with some other product and earned a revenue of around 75k in 8 months. We had a dream to come to silicon valley. As we got some money, we thought to come here, applied for TCDisrupt and came down.<p>Now I&#x27;m here at SF for 2 months. I met many people, including some YC alumni. I can feel the ecosystem and the energy spread out here. The last two weeks which made a huge difference in my life, I learned much more than that I did in my last one year. I badly want to be a part of this ecosystem NOW, and build something exiting. I have a great team of 4 members, I believe this ecosystem can do a lot for us to build a great product. Now, I want to take my team here. I think we can do things in a month which we do in India with one year time<p>I am looking for some options for that. There are some issues including VISA, funding etc (none of us have an immigrant visa, in B1 now)<p>I think, if we don&#x27;t end up in paying for visa, we can manage some of our early days expense here with the revenue we have now. I asked for help/suggestion from many people I met here most of their suggestion is to raise funding here or to get into some accelerators like YC etc. Am trying all those, didn&#x27;t get a string to hang on yet<p>I don&#x27;t think I am the first person who faced this issue.

Allocating bandwidth, storage, compute.<p>Before Bitcoin was a thing, I was thinking about the Erlang VM&#x27;s &quot;reduction-counting&quot; processing paradigm, and noticed that it was a lot like having a dom0-scheduler &quot;treasury&quot; with domU-process &quot;citizens&quot;, where each citizen gets paid a basic income every scheduling interval, and then can spend it to &quot;purchase&quot; time-spent-aware on a virtual core.<p>In Erlang&#x27;s model, processes lose whatever they don&#x27;t spend in a given interval—this is necessary to prevent a process from &quot;saving up&quot; and then blocking the VM for seconds at a time. However, if rather than putting a cap on wealth, you just cap <i>spending per interval</i>, then processes could do lots of other clever things with their income: trade it, invest it, spawn subagents that consume it, etc. This would be a very interesting platform for running goal-directed AI agents on: somewhere between Core Wars and Heroku.<p>Now, if the only &quot;ledger&quot; of reductions was in the local dom0, you&#x27;d have nothing more than a toy server: a sort of fishtank for agents to interact within. But throw a blockchain at the problem, and now agents could pay to spawn sub-agents (or copy themselves) anywhere that&#x27;ll take their dom0&#x27;s currency.<p>Interestingly, since cryptocoins are all pretty fungible, this would imply that the &quot;intelligence&quot; of an AI—or of a hypothetical Hansonian brain-emulation, for that matter—could be measured in units of dollars-spent-per-second.",1412471027

I hate that Paypal only lets me withdraw to single bank (out of like 50...) here in Taiwan because they misinterpret and misrepresent Taiwanese law (so I have to go and open an account). I hate that it takes days to handle a transfer because of the trust and verification involved. I hate that for some of the places you need particular OS or particular software to do banking (Windows and ActiveX for most banks here if they even have an online banking system, and I&#x27;m on Linux), so most often I have to actually walk to an ATM and do my business there (when they are working...).<p>There are a lot of bitcoin haters out there. I personally could not ever go back exclusively to the old ways. I love that finance is in my own hand!<p>By the way, this makes me much more generous as well! (I&#x27;ve donated much more via bitcoin directly to people I wanted to support than I&#x27;d ever done via fiat: too much hustle, too big cut by others, and they also have their independence and choices of cashing the coins out if they need, or use whatever they want to manage it).",1412470984

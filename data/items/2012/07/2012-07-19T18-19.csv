4267523,comment,4267036,4267036,1,0,rrbrambley,,,"Thanks for posting this information. We just applied this week and it would have been useful to know all this stuff.<p>My experience:
The application process was very painful due to bugs in the application. After spending hours filling out the application and getting our video recorded correctly, there was a PHP error on the last page of the application, which effectively deleted all of our application answers. I hit the back button, and <i>poof</i>, all fields empty. I should have known that there was a reason for the message on the previous pages that said something to the effect of ""If you get errors, email info@angelpad.org"". So we emailed AngelPad.<p>A few days later, we still hadn't received a response. Luckily, we had most of our answers in text files and chat logs, so we didn't have to completely rewrite everything, but it was nevertheless very frustrating. Again, the application failed on the last page, with some PHP crap printed at the top.<p>A couple days later, I saw a tweet from AngelPad, reminding people to apply, so I responded immediately and asked if the errors had been fixed, mentioning that I also emailed. No response. Nothing.<p>So yeah, a day or two later, I re-pasted all our answers into the form and it worked. Finally.<p>I realize that AngelPad is probably receiving a ton of emails and tweets directed at them, and they obviously cannot respond to everyone. However, it's really discouraging as a pre-launch, unfunded startup to have such a bad experience after spending a day of your time answering questions, knowing that there's already only a tiny chance that you'll ever even hear back. Honestly, my co-founder and I actually had a long discussion about submitting this application we actually kind of fought about whether we should be spending our time doing such a thing, rather than working on our product. When I eventually convinced him that we should apply, everything went wrong.<p>Sorry for the rant, I just had to get that off my chest. If you're applying, save your answers frequently.",1342724221

4267498,comment,4266485,4266897,49,0,jashkenas,,,"Sure thing.<p>But first, for the ""kinds of things"" that Backbone helps with, take a quick scroll through the list of examples available here: <a href=""http://backbonejs.org/#examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/#examples</a><p>Here's a bit of typical (if exaggerated) jQuery to render/update the UI for a list of ""accounts"":<p><pre><code>    $("".account"").each(function(){
      var id = $(this).attr('data-id');
      var data = window.accountJSON[id];
      $(this).find("".name"").text(data.name);
      for (var i = 0, l = data.emails.length; i < l; i++) {
        var e = data.emails[i];
        $(this).append($(""<div class='email'></div>"").text(e));
      }
      var addresses = $(this).find("".address"").length;
      $(this).find("".address_count"").text(addresses);
    });
</code></pre>
... note that we're looking into specific DOM classes, pulling data from a big 'ol global JSON object, looking up id values from the DOM, and so on.<p>Here's something a little bit closer you really want to write instead:<p><pre><code>    Accounts.each(function(account) {
      new AccountView({model: account});
    });
</code></pre>
For each account, render its UI. Of course, this is just sweeping a lot of the complexity of the original example under the rug -- but that's the point -- you want your UI in HTML templates, and your data/model logic to be in ""clean"" JavaScript code unpolluted by UI concerns. Then, when you refactor your design later, all of your client-side business logic doesn't have to change -- it no longer cares about global nested JSON structures or concrete DOM elements.<p>For another Backbone example, imagine taking all of the songs by a given artist, and rating them with 5 stars:<p><pre><code>    Songs.each(function(song) {
      if (song.get('artist') == ""Wire"") {
        song.set({stars: 5});
      }
    });
</code></pre>
... and your UI updates accordingly, and you can change that "".set"" to a "".save"" call to persist the tracks back to your server as well.",1342723924

I've had a lot of success with Knockout and fully expect that, like Sinatra did to me with Rails, Knockout will teach me to appreciate Backbone soonish. In the meantime, here's the knockout pitch:<p>What Knockout does is allow you to keep separate models (which are plain-old Javascript objects; Knockout doesn't need to infect them or enforce any kind of structure to them at all) and DOM UI. Knockout's job is to keep the two in sync. For instance, if you have an array of Foo's rendered in a table, Knockout allows you to bind a ""foreach"" to the table's body, effectively turning a single TR into a template for each Foo. Then, if the elements of the Foo array change dynamically, Knockout makes the table reliably reflect the constitution of the array.<p>The core value here isn't ""templating"". It's ""keeping the DOM in sync with Javascript objects"".<p>Off the top of my head, I think we're talking about 3 lines of code to get that functionality: the data-bind attribute on the TBODY element, the ko.observableArray() that wraps your otherwise plain array of Foos, and the ko.applyBindings(RootModel, RootDomElement) call that kicks off Knockout.<p>The same functionality would probably cost 10-20 lines of jQuery; more importantly, that jQ code would be fiddley, not at all declarative, and duplicated every place you wanted to bind an array to some repeating DOM structure. Knockout is here, to my eyes, a clean win.<p>Or take forms: you bind (with data attributes) INPUT elements to Javascript objects, so that what their values are changed by user input, the Javascript objects automatically reflect their new values. The JS code that then cares about the value of these objects doesn't ever need to scrape out the values of forms, and can reliably assume whatever's in the fields or hashes or whatever you set up is going to be current input. Also: you can bind multiple form inputs to the same data and keep them in sync, which I found to be a pleasant way to implement an ""Advanced Search"" feature.<p>What I didn't like about Backbone was the notion it had of ""Models"" and ""Routers"" and stuff like that. I'm sure that's valuable structure to have, but I like the flexibility --- and, more importantly, the freedom for More Stuff I Have To Memorize --- that comes with the KO.js approach.",1342722871

When everything was running on the bare metal, we had to schedule the updates for the middle of the night and carefully migrate the data in-place to avoid interrupting service. It would take 8 to 12 hours.<p>Since we moved to EC2, updating is simpler. The service runs on a micro instance. We launch a large instance to do all the CPU- and IO-intensive processing that prepares the new dataset, then launch a new micro instance, upload the dataset, run a few smoke tests, and if all is well, cut over to it. Because we're doing it off line, we were able to optimize the data processing for speed rather than low resource usage, and cut the runtime down to 45 minutes.<p>One thing that's often missed in discussions of IaaS versus bare metal is that the elasticity of a particular application can be affected by its design. When we were running on dedicated machines, we smoothed out the load to avoid idle hardware, but after moving to EC2 we concentrated it into spikes to get maximum productivity from running instances. In our case, spiky load is better from a business point of view, because serving data that's 1-25 hours old is better than data that's 8-32 hours old.",1342722477

    about six months before they fully accept that no one is 
    going to tell them what to do, that no manager is going 
    to give them a review, that there is no such thing as a 
    promotion or a job title or even a fixed role (although 
    there are generous raises and bonuses based on value to 
    the company, as assessed by peers). That it is their 
    responsibility, and theirs alone, to allocate the most 
    valuable resource in the company  their time  by 
    figuring out what it is that they can do that is most 
    valuable for the company, and then to go do it. That if 
    they decide that they should be doing something 
    different, theres no manager to convince to let them 
    go; they just move their desk to the new group (the 
    desks are on wheels, with computers attached) and start 
    in on the new thing. (Obviously they should choose a 
    good point at which to do this, and coordinate with both 
    groups, but thats common sense, not a rule, and isnt 
    enforced in any way.) That everyone on a project team is 
    an individual contributor, doing coding, artwork, level 
    design, music, and so on, including the leads; there is 
    no such thing as a pure management or architect or 
    designer role. That any part of the company can change 
    direction instantly at any time, because there are no 
    managers to cling to their people and their territory, 
    no reorgs to plan, no budgets to work around. That there 
    are things that Gabe badly wants the company to do that 
    arent happening, because no one has signed up to do 
    them.

4267255,comment,4266017,4266017,2,0,mammalfriend,,,"This seems like bad advice from someone who is not especially experienced at building startups. As he suggests, there are kernels of knowledge but the recommendations are unbalanced and in many cases suggest he made newbie mistakes (e.g. - I didn't know how to manage my lawyer, so you should not hire one at all!).<p>There seems to be an abundance of advice out there regarding startups from people who have very limited experience, and it's a bit worrying to see it get voted up on hackernews so easily.",1342720867

They always ask for my security answers. I say ""I don't use them because they are less secure than my computer and my password."" They usually agree.<p>I've also had success in the past with modifying the expiration date of the bank's ""I remember you and your device"" cookies.

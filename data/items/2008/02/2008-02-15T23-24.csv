Are they also releasing the complete original raw footage and audio tracks for remixing?<p>Seems a misuse of the term.<p>What might a better way to express what's actually happening here?   ""Open source"" is catchy (or at least pity), and conveys a sense of user freedom, but there's no more or less ""source"" than would otherwise be available.<p>It would be nice to have an equally catchy, but accurate, phrase.<p>Open licensing?",1203119723

Do you have anything that can work on facebook? =)  We might also do video ads from Google, if we can.  We can most likely target according to the gift cards people want.<p>We're also going to add a history of bidding so you know exactly what you've done...<p>Perhaps we should be giving a LOT more points for friend invites :)<p>I'll throw it up on our todo list! 
Thanks again man!",1203119225

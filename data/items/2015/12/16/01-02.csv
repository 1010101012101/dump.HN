Since nobody relevant uses Linode for production any more due to security and other issues, probably time to move personal blogs and accrue transferable skills.<p>People also compare the big holy wow bandwidth/SSD/CPU offered by DO and Linode without accounting for the fact that you could almost never use it all at the price point without hitting (a) capacities of the instance and (b) annoyed employees. Jeff&#x27;s data on how successful their CPU quota accounting is backs this up. If you&#x27;re pegging a core in your workload you should probably own the core.<p>Seriously, think about it.

It doesn&#x27;t tell you how state will be managed and reasoned about, which along with asyncronous sequencing is the main challenge of browser development. Server side MVC doesn&#x27;t really have this problem because at the end of they day the lifecycle of a HTTP request is relatively limited. Most JavaScript MVC libraries have their own answers for how state should change, but just being answers does not necessarily make them complete, good, or right for your application.<p>My general strategy these days is to avoid parts of my code having to know that other units are &quot;a Backbone collection&quot; or &quot;a React view&quot;, and instead to have those as implementation details that I wrap in a smaller, more limited API. Instead of a framework I just use an event bus with a catalog of events that are very specific to my application. In a way this creates a &quot;data&quot; or &quot;service&quot; layer that has to fulfill event contracts, which are basically abstractions over HTTP, websockets, local storage, etc, and a &quot;statically allocated&quot; view layer that only knows how to respond and trigger a few events on the bus.

I don&#x27;t know about the situation between Germany/the EU vis-a-vis the US, but, as an example, the EU rules specify that in almost all cases consumers get to sue / can only be sued at their place of residence (unless they consent to a different venue).<p>This is to ensure a somewhat level playing field, since the consumer is usually the weaker party. I would argue that, even though it&#x27;s not a consumer vs. company lawsuit the situation is comparable and it&#x27;s fair to empower her with the choice of venue. I also don&#x27;t see it as an unreasonable burden to consider the legal situation in Germany when you&#x27;re publishing information about a German citizen, in German.

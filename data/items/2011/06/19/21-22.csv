That is, creating an un-hackable system isn't the problem.<p>It's probably unrealistic to expect that anyone will ever create a completely un-hackable system. Rather, one should design their systems to fail gracefully under attack.<p>If someone breaks in to my Citibank account, it doesn't much matter to me, because the banks have the authority to roll back transactions with the push of a button. Their power to do so is the greatest layer of security in the whole system; just as we have seen with Mt Gox.<p>Unfortunately, Mt Gox is not bitcoin, it's simply an exchange, so it's once removed from bitcoin itself. The owner of that account still lost $1000, and no one can reverse it. Contrast that with bitcoin, and you can begin to see the problem.<p>This is a fundamental issue with all currencies, not just bitcoin. It's a trade-off. When you hold currency, you hold responsibility for securing it. If I kept $500k in USD (paper currency, bonds, whatever) under my mattress, I'd have no recourse if someone broke in to my house and stole it. That is why I'm ok with keeping my money in a bank.

What I mean by that is that say for instance he is given 60% equity with the idea in mind that he will do x amount of work. If three months down the road you think he's not doing x amount will you feel satisfied in giving this type of equity. I understand you do not want to be taken advantage of in this scenario as much of the benefit from a start up is gained in the equity but attempting to decide the equity decision so early on especially if neither of you is bringing something particularly unique and/or valuable to the equation is difficult. For that reason I agree with your partner in that you are probably better of waiting until later on to decide the equity split. As long as you have the general agreement that you are both in a partnership and are going to execute on whatever idea I believe the equity question will more or less work itself out as the work is completed.",1308518997

In fact, one of the hallmarks of reusable code is that it is efficient in a wide variety of circumstances; frequently the author of an API cannot predict what it will be used for, and thus must at the very least avoid pathological inefficiency when possible.<p>> <i>I was not thinking about performance, about the efficiency of what I wrote, at all; I simply did not want to think about it at the time.</i><p>Bad software happens when you don't think about the efficiency of what you're writing <i>at all</i>.  This perspective is completely detached from reality; in the real world, your code runs on a real machine and does real work.  Sure, in some circumstances it's entirely appropriate to write inefficient code, but that's a decision that should be made after an assessment of the problem at hand.  To intentionally ignore efficiency as a matter of policy is to ignore the facts of reality.<p>At the very least, you need to consider the performance impacts of the data structures you use.

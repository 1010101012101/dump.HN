You can&#x27;t impose it on people.<p>In contrast in a capitalist system the capitalists can prosper from the communists desire not to exploit their fellow men; whilst in a communist system those who want to satisfy their own greed at the expense of others tear the system apart.<p>Those who act contrary to capitalist ideals actually help to maintain it - run a food bank, run a homeless charity and you&#x27;re helping to dissolve hostility to the system that forces people in to situations where such things are necessary. Personal charity maintains the system in which those who don&#x27;t exercise charity can prosper and more readily exploit others to that end.<p>Thoughts?",1424267925

9068482,comment,9068352,9068352,0,0,emehrkay,,,"&quot;Android is Android&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t like the fact that Google&#x27;s apps, all of them, feel foreign on iOS and OSX. Chrome has its own PDF renderer, settings pane, maximize behavior (before Yosemite), other little things. The iOS apps feel like the Android ones.<p>Google seems to be creating its own little OS inside of every other OS and the baseline is Chrome (OS). Wasn&#x27;t there an effort, or talk about, to have Chrome do its own thing in Windows 8? This is why Material Design is important to Google. It targets the lowest common dominator, web browsers, and seems like it runs the same on a powerful computer or low-spec&#x27;d phone. While Material looks good, I feel that they may have held back a little because of browser limitations (you cannot do overlay blurring like iOS, for example).<p>Anyway, a lot of people love the common feel of apps across platforms. People seem to really like that about SublimeText and Chrome. I personally don&#x27;t. I thought it was in poor taste when Apple made Safari and iTunes behave as if it were on OS X when running on Windows and I think Apple even had its on OS X-style update windows for the windows apps.<p>It&#x27;s a fine line. As a developer Id rather code once and ship than to figure out all of the little idiosyncrasies for every platform. As a certain type of user I want apps to act like the other apps on my platform of choice, most users probably don&#x27;t care or notice though.",1424267883

This means resolving inconsistencies after the fact, somewhat similar to &quot;eventual consistency&quot;. It is more coarse-grained, can be harder to reason about, but may scale better (no serialization).<p>With a rebase, git bisect will point to one of the rebased commits, each of which already interacted with the branch coming before. Rebasing is sort of similar to the situation where DB client retries a transaction because the DB doesn&#x27;t know how to serialize 2 transactions. It is more fine-grained, can be easier to reason about, but may have problems scaling, and may sometimes be tedious.",1424267852

Another is that they&#x27;re despotically obsessive about &quot;user need&quot;, so don&#x27;t understand that user needs need to be balanced with business needs (reduce call centre costs), system needs (we&#x27;ve invested <i>x</i> in Windows, for better or worse), and operational needs (supporting a single, self-configuring .NET .exe on 2,000 desktops through WSUS is a <i>lot</i> cheaper and easier than installing, configuring and maintaining a Windows service, a web server and an HTML application on 2,000 desktops).",1424267625

This is great, as the time of day has a lot of influence on the mood you&#x27;ll want your music to convey.<p>On the other hand, player view got one thing wrong. In this view, you can swipe down anywhere to exit the player view - as the player is &quot;minimized&quot; when you&#x27;re browsing for music. However, swiping down anywhere really means <i>anywhere</i> - even when you&#x27;re trying to skip the current song, and your finger happens to move down a little (maybe because you&#x27;re driving), it minimizes the player rather than skipping the song.

If I&#x27;m working on a feature branch that other developers are also working on I do the same thing with the feature branch; my local work is on a local branch that I rebase onto the tip of the shared feature branch.<p>When I want to share my commits, I do my rebase first, do a fast-forward merge in the shared branch (with or without a merge commit, depending on whether or not I need to group my commits), and then I push the shared branch. After that my local branch is rooted at the tip of the shared branch, and prior history never gets rebased again.<p>Merging master into a shared feature branch requires different techniques; we don&#x27;t use rebase for that. Instead we coordinate: everyone gets their work into the feature branch (or takes responsibility for anything they&#x27;re not ready to commit yet), and one person takes on merging master into the feature branch, fixing conflicts, and pushing the result back to the shared branch. Everyone else pulls, rebases any local work they still have, and we move on. When it&#x27;s time to merge the feature branch into master we do the same thing, but no local work is allowed to be held back, and the person doing the merging will also merge the final feature branch back into master.<p>Luckily I&#x27;m in a small company with not too many developers. I can see the coordination required for what I just described getting more and more difficult as the branches get bigger, last longer, and have more people working on them. When you get up to that scale the Linux Kernel approach of breaking the project into largely independent sub-projects with different owners responsible for merging their own parts is probably the best approach.

This means both types of system collapse without regulation - in the west these regulations are an extensive set of laws against monopolies, manipulating markets, insider information etc. and yet we still see regular very destructive whole-market crashes and speculative bubbles which devastate our economies. It&#x27;s just the least worst system we know.<p>I can see how coming from a former communist block country where Marx was treated almost as a deity along with the likes of Lenin and Stalin would give you a healthy disrespect for him. However, Marx is a useful critique of capitalist dogma, even if you don&#x27;t agree with his prescriptions for a solution, or the solutions people made up in his name. When he was writing capitalism in the west was in one of its most brutal and pure states and was an obviously flawed and exploitative system with little hope of improvement in life for the majority - as recorded by Engels for example at around the same time [1]. So don&#x27;t mistake those who take his critique of capitalism seriously (like Varoufakis) for those who embrace every aspect of his thought or would support leninism or stalinism.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17306/17306-h/17306-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17306/17306-h/17306-h.htm</a>",1424266355
9068367,comment,9067087,9068058,0,0,DougWebb,,,"The problems are twofold. First, these files and some others that VS uses are XML, and XML has this property where semantically-equivalent files can be structurally-different. Empty elements can be rendered with or without end tags, empty attributes can be present or absent, whitespace between tags doesn&#x27;t matter, etc.<p>(sln files aren&#x27;t really XML, but they&#x27;re XML-like in their structure. I&#x27;ve had fewer problems with them than the other files.)<p>The second issue is the way Visual Studio modifies these files: it reads and parses them into a DOM tree, makes changes to the DOM, and then serializes the DOM back out to the file. So a small change in one part of the project causes the entire file to be re-written, and it often gets restructured in the process. I&#x27;ve found this to be a bigger problem when different developers are using different versions of Visual Studio; at my company we&#x27;ve had 2010, 2012, and 2013 all in use at the same time on the same projects until everyone upgraded. (And we had good reasons for not upgrading everyone at once.)<p>I guess there&#x27;s a third reason: most .NET developers never look at these files directly; for the most part they are only modified through Visual Studio. So, although they&#x27;re just text files and conflicts are resolved the same way they&#x27;re resolved in code, that&#x27;s made more difficult by not knowing what the files are supposed to look like or what the correct resolution should be. The sln files are particularly annoying in this regard because they&#x27;re about 80% Guid strings and 20% readable text, so it can be really hard to understand the diff.<p>When I started working with .NET, I had to learn all about these file formats when I started running into conflicts in them, and now I&#x27;m comfortable fixing conflicts and often editing them directly. I&#x27;ve helped most of my team gain the same comfort level, so we don&#x27;t have problems anymore. The conflicts, when they happen, are just annoying now.",1424266319

My impression of the coasts is ALL the burbs have on the coasts is houses, if you want to buy a pop-tart or a bottle of pepsi you need to drive into the coastal city to shop, etc.  So &quot;new urbanism&quot; and all that confuses the hell out of midwesterners.  So the coasties say if I move downtown I&#x27;ll have vibrant cultural activities but there&#x27;s nothing to do downtown and any time I want to do something I&#x27;d have to jump in a car and drive out to the burbs.<p>This also confuses coasties who get imported.  So they think our downtown is like Manhattan but a little smaller, and are mystified that its possibly the most boring four square miles of office buildings on the planet, and tell everyone there&#x27;s nothing to do in Milwaukee but get drunk, get drugs, and get shot at...  but drive out to the burbs, like maybe Brookfield, and we have concerts in the park every summer weekend, and symphony and other music in the amphitheater maybe every other weekend, at multiple sites, and festivals and fairs and street parties and parks and great shopping and great food stores and ... But you gotta drive out to the burbs to have any fun, cities are dead.<p>The imports have a really rough time, property developers have made these million dollar condos for california people to move into because &quot;all the fun is downtown&quot; back home and condos are supposed to cost a million bucks.  But it doesn&#x27;t work that way in the midwest, so the get all depressed / freaked out that there&#x27;s nothing to do outside their million dollar downtown condo but get drunk, get drugs, get robbed, or get shot.  Could buy a great house in a great school district in a great lifestyle area for a quarter mil, but no, the imports all get a million dollar downtown condo and complain there&#x27;s nothing to do but get drunk.<p>In the midwest the cities are empty and soul-less, whereas I&#x27;m told on the coasts its the burbs that are empty and soul-less.  This confuses the heck out of everyone when coasties and midwesterners talk to each other.<p>2) On the coasts if someone says they&#x27;re from NY its over 50% odds they are literally living at a postal address in NYC.  In contrast, in the midwest, most people you meet are not from the closest downtown office building city but they WILL say they are.  90% of the people who claim to live in Minneapolis do NOT live in MPLS but in a burb in the greater metro area.  I tell people I&#x27;m from Milwaukee and people who know MKE feel sad for me and the coasties humorously think I grew up in an office building or in the north side slums, but I actually grew up three burbs to the west (about 15 miles?) in something of a paradise.<p>Some girls I dated a long time ago were &quot;from Minneapolis&quot; or &quot;from Detroit&quot; but what that really means in midwestern speak is they lived in a burb and the closest skyscraper was maybe 2 miles away in Detroit, for example.",1424266197

Lawsuits typically only happened if negotiations broke down, because they are expensive and/or risky for both sides. This may or may not have happened in this case, as TFA does not mention it.<p>However, licensing is risky these days. The Medimmune v Genentech decision (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedImmune,_Inc._v._Genentech,_Inc."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedImmune,_Inc._v._Genentech,_I...</a>) significantly changed the calculus of licensing negotiations. Essentially, it enabled potential and current licensees to preemptively sue the licensor for &quot;Declaratory Judgment&quot;. This is bad for licensors because 1) any tentative approach for licensing can blow up in their face, and 2) if it does, the licensor will have to expend considerable resources fighting a lawsuit they didn&#x27;t want, 3) in a venue that then becomes wherever the DJ is filed, which may be unfavorable to the licensor for many reasons, such as <i>not</i> being EDTexas.<p>Ok, I was just picking on EDTexas (Delaware is just as common), but the venue matters for many reasons, including the state of the docket, local laws and the primary political leanings (and other biases) of the judges and jury pool. As a simplified example, you don&#x27;t want to sue an automotive company in Detroit. Forum-shopping is something that should not exist, but is an unfortunate reality of the current system.

We are not discussing convenience; we&#x27;re discussing safety. Are you trying to de-rail the debate? :)<p>By the way, because you&#x27;re intent on &quot;teaching&quot; me what deduction and induction mean: not that it has anything to do with the argument at hand, but deductive reasoning (when you can apply it) trumps inductive.<p>> > <i>Yes, fewer failure modes -> increased probability of correctness.</i><p>> <i>That&#x27;s an interesting hypothesis.</i><p>That&#x27;s... uh... that&#x27;s not an hypothesis. Something that can fail in fewer ways is safer than something that can fail in more varied ways, all else being equal. There is no need for inductive reasoning here.<p>> <i>BTW, have you not heard &quot;no true scotsman&quot; before?</i><p>I have, and I have also noticed you were trying to sarcastically invoke this fallacy all along. Unfortunately, it seems you&#x27;ve misunderstood it: No True Scotman applies when you make an assertion, then you&#x27;re presented with a contradiction, and in order to counter it you adopt an ad hoc assertion which serves as an exception. <i>The fallacy doesn&#x27;t apply when the assertion is not ad hoc, but in fact that which defines the original assertion.</i> Haskell programmers program using <i>Maybe</i>, that&#x27;s not a &quot;No True Scotman&quot; fallacy. For example, if I said &quot;Haskell programmers do X&quot;, and you say &quot;that&#x27;s not true for Haskell programmers using Ruby!&quot; and I counter &quot;I was talking about Haskell programmers using <i>Haskell</i>&quot;, that&#x27;s not a case of No True Scotman. It&#x27;s the same for Haskell programmers using the <i>Maybe</i> monad.<p>Let me explain the kind of flawed reasoning you&#x27;ve been using so far. Say you read something about handguns with safeties being safer than handguns without safeties. You start &quot;blah blah inductive reasoning no true scotman yadda yadda&quot;. When someone counters, &quot;well, are you saying handguns with safeties designed to make them safer are not actually safer than handguns without safeties?&quot; your reply seems to be &quot;well, if you give the handgun with safety to a kid, load the gun, switch the safety off, and tell the kid to pull the trigger, then it&#x27;s not safer!&quot;.<p>Do you see the ridiculousness of your position? Any Turing complete language can be used improperly and cause harm. But <i>some</i> languages are safer than others <i>by design</i>. Not better, merely safer. For example, Haskell is safer than Ruby :)",1424264927

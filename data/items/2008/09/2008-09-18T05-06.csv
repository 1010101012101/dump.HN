-the JumpBox is portable across virtualization systems
-the JumpBox can be brought up on EC2 if need be
-you can use the backup/restore feature to create an archive of the delta of what changes you've made to the LAMP stack and just keep that. if you need a new copy, get a blank jumpbox and inject the backup into it and you're back where you were
-we have a Rails stack as well as a LAMP stack which is even more of a time saver-> <a href=""http://www.jumpbox.com/app/rubyonrails"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jumpbox.com/app/rubyonrails</a>

That's a long time."" [1]<p>Then he asks: ""And how are monopolies lost?"", following with his explanation for the phenomenon, which I don't think is accurate, because he bases it on the supposition that monopolies are created by great products, which certainly has not been the case with Windows.<p>I read somewhere that monopolies are not lost: they become irrelevant. Although I don't know if that is correct either: at Apple's case, what made it loose its monopoly was not technological irrelevancy, but the commoditization of complements promoted by Microsoft[2], which offered a slower, uglier, less robust, but cheaper alternative for the masses, forging the base for the Windows platform that would create a vicious circle, ""forcing"" users and developers to use its graphical interface.<p>But I don't have much knowledge about the rise and fall of monopolists, and that's why I would like to hear your answers, besides the obvious answer of governmental intervention.<p>Do you agree with my theory about Apple's fall? And more generally, what other cases do you know of monopolies that were not lost by technological irrelevancy or intervention?<p>[1] http://www.businessweek.com/print/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041012_4018_db083.htm?chan=gl<p>[2] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html",1221716007

For instance, I am thinking I might run my new business for two years and then get out of it. I think it's an opportunity to make a tremendous amount of money for two years, but I'm not sure [whether] it's proprietary enough to stop the competition from getting in. So I'm in with an exit strategy of doing it for two years and then winding down.</i><p>I had thought that an ""exit strategy"" was a trade sale or IPO; and the
no-exit alternative was a sustainable business (e.g. life-style business).
But the above makes sense, for a great opportunity that looks hard to
defend.<p>I don't like the idea of quitting after two years.  It seems
dodgey somehow.  I'd rather create a sustainable, living business.<p>But my start-up idea is a software library, and they are infamously easy
to reverse-engineer (e.g. open source).  So an exit strategy could be to
make money for a limited time, then make it free.  I'm
really lacking clarity on this... and would appreciate your new perspectives.<p><i>The above quote is from John Osher (serial entrepreneur): http://www.cpd.ogi.edu/mst/capstone/17Mistakes.htm</i><p><i>Previously on HN: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=221750</i>",1221715156

Don't make the same mistake I did.)<p>When you're young you don't need immediate profit from your investments. You have many years to sit on them. You want to buy low and sell high. When's the best time to buy low? When the market is crashing!<p>So now, more than ever, is the time to save, save, save. Earn money and invest it. Live cheaply and save. Buy stocks with a portion of your savings. Buy them while everyone else is selling them, and take time now and then to bless the universe for giving you a 25% (and counting!) drop in the S&P500 over the last year. No matter whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued, buying them at a 25% discount from what they used to be is a good thing.<p>Of course, those of us who already have some stocks have a mixed blessing: The portfolio value is collapsing, but there's also a chance to buy more at fire-sale prices. And those who happen to be baby boomers are totally screwed, because they have to retire <i>tomorrow</i> and their savings -- even if they happened to have had any -- are rapidly vanishing at precisely the wrong moment. So stock market crashes aren't all wine and roses for everyone. But, if you happen to be in your twenties, they're good news.<p>(For more details I recommend Bernstein's <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i>. Sadly, it's clear to me now that every year that I didn't know about this book was costing me money.)",1221714541

The problem is that most people move onto something else as soon as they have something that works. In this case, the code becomes a maintenance nightmare until someone actually takes the time to refactor it.<p>When immediate refactoring is unlikely (either due to laziness, lack of focus, or feature deadlines), some kind of balance has to be reached on what should be more general and reusable and what should be hard-coded and specific. And then we're right back where we started.<p>But reading and thinking about your posts has been very insightful. On my next project, I will try your approach. I agree that in the long run, it is likely to be a more efficient use of time.

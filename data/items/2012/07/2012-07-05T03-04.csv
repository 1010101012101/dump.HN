An economy based on a currency with low, predictable inflation will have less hoarding than a deflationary currency. Hoarding in itself causes deflation, so deflationary currencies risk causing a deflationary spiral.<p>Do you have an example of a vibrant economy based on a deflationary currency?

Birth control is a valuable adaptation in certain environments, particularly where sex plays an important social role beyond reproduction (see: Bonobos) or where resources are scarce and would be wasted on excess offspring.

Yes, you can get a PHP programmer just about anywhere. But being that there are so many, it's harder to find those few truly talented programmers.<p>My own complaint about this is that if you bring in cheap PHP programmers, you end up with cheaply-written PHP. And the result is inevitably an unmaintainable mess. If you want well-written, maintainable code, you have to be willing to hire talented and experienced programmers. And in doing so, you give up that so vaunted ""advantage"" of PHP's mindshare.<p>Moreover, it seems to me that the truly talented programmers that would produce good software have a tendency to distance themselves from PHP.<p>So it seems to me: Choose PHP for cheap, quick projects on a budget for which quality is irrelevant; or choose a ""harder"" language for solid applications that will stand the test of customer interaction.",1341460180

Whether the <i>idea</i> of swipe to unlock is obvious is irrelevant; ideas can't be patented. Only implementations can be patented. Do you think a programmer familiar with touchscreens and mobile development would have difficulty figuring out how to implement swipe to unlock when presented with the idea?",1341457743

I'm skeptical of how long dart is going to last at google, but this is definitely an impressive piece of work regardless. If it was AS3 -> JS and worked as well as it does now, i feel the web would collectively lose its shit. Unfortunately though this is tied to google, and i don't think many people want to be stuck being supported solely by google anymore.",1341457647

If you look at the lives of a lot of artists (and a lot of scientists throughout history!), it seems that a great many of them had miserable lives because of this tortured search for ""something that could be better, something missing, something needed.""<p>There's an old legend where I live, in the Czech Republic, of a fire bird.  The hero sees the bird and his horse tells him, ""If we turn around right now, you'll have a nice life, a quiet, happy life... but if you capture that bird, you'll cry and you'll suffer, and your life will be an amazing adventure.""

You will want to pay special attention to the global php settings (if you turn on register_globals even in development you deserve to get sued for malpractice)  and you will want to understand the different layers of encryption that support your application. You also need to engineer your applications workflow with an eye towards separating out different kinds of access. A patient filling out a form should not be able to access any other patient records. A doctor or clinical assistant should be able to view only those records their role requires; any patient record access should be recorded in an audit log that is not accessible to any user directly.<p>Also, drop mysql for postgres; php support for postgres is very good and postgres supports in database public key encryption which you will want.",1267628075

If however they took the time to read the patent claims, they would see that they are relatively specific. For example: <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=L-IeAAAAEBAJ&dq=5,566,337"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=L-IeAAAAEBAJ&dq=5...</a><p>Now I'm not saying that software patents are necessarily right, but I am growing weary of people making broad generalizations based on the titles of these patents and having them perpetuated.

If you went to LN (Lawyer News - doesn't exist, but let's pretend for my analogy) and there was a lawyer claiming that Javascript is stupid because it has the word Java in it and therefore must have all the attributes of Java and he hates Java, we'd all cringe at his lack of knowledge of the subject and wish he'd leave it up to the Hackers who actually know what they're talking about to criticize.",1267625885

So, I raised the bar, reading literature critique. Then, I realized it is pure bullshit, and jumped into sociology, then into philosophy, then into philosophy of mathematics and it turned out that pure textbooks are much more interesting after all.<p>Shortly, I agree it depends on the goal. Keep in mind, though, that people's goals vary a lot. And that's my point rephrased otherwise: if you are not interested in reading something, give up.

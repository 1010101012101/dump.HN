If that is true, Cuban would have been more effectice if he simply stated that the prosecution would have to prove in court that he did anything wrong, and that he is glad to finally get the chance to settle the matter.  Instead, he attacked the prosecutor's motives several times, and denied it only as a last remark.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he is getting all this attention.",1226983942

367829,comment,367248,367668,0,0,heyadayo,,,"@patio11: Actually, you can save bandwidth at the sub-packet level. Ethernet is a common link layer protocol that we can examine: It has a variable length frame, and because it uses time-delimited bit-level framing, the smaller your ethernet frame the quicker it can be sent. The only real caveat to axod's article is that you often can't save on performance of intermediary systems (routers) because they tend to pre-allocate blocks of memory for packets, so no memory is saved when some packets are smaller. But your ISP doesn't meter you at the link layer anyway (or often even the IP level), so the savings as reported by the article are absolutely real in terms of bandwidth costs.

367823,comment,367024,367265,0,0,jhancock,,,"I think the root problem is how we define ""fraud"".  What is fraud in this context?  If you borrow from 1 person/entity using some asset and then borrow from another reusing the same already leveraged asset and are not extremely clear that the asset is already fully committed to the first debt, then it is fraud?  I think so.<p>We seem to be dancing around to issues:  first is fraud and second is usury.  Usury works both ways.  If you gain 50% in less than a year from some investment, then someone is paying 50%. (for simplicity lets ignore the win-win of an expending system, even factoring this, you end up with rates over 10%).  Until the last few decades, usury above 10 or 15 percent was illegal in most U.S. states.  So if a bank is booking earnings on home mortgages of 50% (due to people flipping property in 5 years), then is this usury?  Is it healthy?  Is there any model where these levels of usury are sustainable or healthy for a society as a whole?",1226981303

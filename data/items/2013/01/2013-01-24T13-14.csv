What can I do that is so beautiful or mindbending that I can't do in python?<p>That's kind of a silly question to ask.<p>For one, features are duplicated across masses of languages.  If you ask, 'what is the one specific thing I can do in this language that I couldn't do in some other language?', the answer is almost certainly nothing.  Languages only really start standing out from one another when you start talking about combinations of features.  Javascript's combination of prototyping, closures, and first class functions isn't like any of the other languages on the list even before you get to html DOM manipulation or nosql.<p>But the more important point I'd like to make is, that if a whole bunch of smart people say they really like something, and you can't see why, that should be a sign to look harder.<p>Which is not to say, if a whole bunch of smart people like something you have to like it, too.

If Amazon were to sue Philippe Dubost in the U.S. for infringement, the judge likely would toss out the case under the Supreme Court's <i>Twombly/Iqbal</i> doctrine [3], assuming Dubost filed a motion to dismiss --- I can't imagine how Amazon could plead a <i>plausible</i> case that the infringement had affected its market, as would be required by <i>Twombly/Iqbal.</i><p>3.  In the unlikely event that Amazon did sue Philippe Dubost in the U.S. for infringement, if Dubost won, he might very well be able to recover reasonable attorneys' fees from Amazon [4].<p>4.

At first the biggest killer was waiting for people, snake on my fall back phone was dull! But pretty soon I just got used to using the time to think through problems, make mental lists (that I actually trained myself to remember) and recall good times.<p>I found myself properly engrossed in the TV I was watching (this coincided with getting netflix, so we only watched what we were interested in, not filler TV), as I wasn't half watching everything while studying my phone.<p>My comments on the points you mention:<p>Maps: I'd either study an online map, print a map off, bring an A to Z map, or best of all, just head in the general direction and ask people. Talking to people is not scary!<p>Music: When I was at my PC I had music, but then the time I spent walking was spent actually thinking, not just 'thinking I'm thinking'. Silence is brilliant, and I now don't carry headphones. Also others are far more likely to approach YOU to ask for directions etc.<p>Camera: I've always hated people that spend gigs and festivals glued to the camera, so I've always tried to enjoy the moment without worrying about capturing it as social proof. There's been times that I've missed the chance to snap something cool - but now I just tell my friends about it in person down the pub, rather than post it to facebook. If I'm going somewhere cool, I'l take a real camera and get far far better pictures.<p>Email: I'm far more productive between 9-5 if I keep my emails to 9-5. If someone needs me they can call or text, but generally - and email doesn't need answering for at least a day. In the office I now only check my emails 3 times a day, any more and I know that I'm just 'making work' for myself, rather than doing work.<p>Anyway, I understand why they these might all be a loss for others, but for me, they've freed me up, and let me enjoy my life a bit more, than trying to feel like I'm cramming entertainment or 'work' into every second.",1359035097

5109422,comment,5107615,5108218,3,0,tokenadult,,,"I'm with you in thinking that this technology will be quite revolutionary. When I was in elementary school, the school year before the moon landing, my classmates and I made a time capsule, filling it with our predictions of the world of 2001. The time capsule was opened that year (I was overseas at the time, so I missed the big ceremony for that), and our predictions could then be tested against reality. We all recognized that exhaust emissions of cars would have to be reduced, and they were, but by incremental improvements in Otto-cycle engine designs rather than by switching to electric cars, as we predicted.<p>What we didn't anticipate was truly personal, individual vehicles that could drive themselves even within within twenty years of 2001. I thought that the world would move toward more fixed-path public transportation solutions, like the monorails that always featured in 1960s visions of the future.<p>The comments below your comment on use cases are very interesting. This whole subthread is food for thought. My thought, as a married man with three children still at home, and one grown child in another state who might still join us on family trips from time to time, is that we will probably buy ONE more car that isn't self-driving, to replace the older of our two cars in the next few years, and then ONE self-driving car to be my wife's main commuting car, with her stuff stashed inside. For all other trips, we will subscribe to an on-call car service, which will surely be cheaper per use than full ownership of a second car. The car service cars can be parked all over town for instant availability. They will be intelligently dispatched by algorithms that balance speed of arrival with passenger preferences such as whether or not the car has child safety  seats, whether or not the passenger prefers to work or to relax with a great sound system during the drive, and so on.  I greatly look forward to this lifestyle. I substitute a lot of walking and bicycling for car driving already, and just knowing that eventually (not REAL soon) all the cars sharing the road and street with me will have competent robot drivers is a huge improvement.<p>The Wall Street Journal article ""Why Driverless Cars Are Inevitable--and That's a Good Thing""<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443524904577651552635911824.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044352490457765...</a><p>from a few months ago has more about the economy-changing dynamics of driverless cars. I can't wait--but I'll observe the speed limit while I'm driving as I attempt to wait.<p>AFTER EDIT: Responding to comments elsewhere in this interesting thread, why I think Google Maps will probably be licensed into most self-driving car packages, even if the hardware is built mostly by other companies, is that Google Maps is relentless in adding data to its geographic database.<p>SEP 6 2012, Alexis Madrigal's column in The Atlantic, shared previously to HN, ""How Google Builds Its Mapsand What It Means for the Future of Everything""<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-go...</a><p>September 27, 2012, David Pogue's column in the New York Times: ""What Makes Googles Maps So Good""<p><a href=""http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/what-makes-googles-maps-so-good/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/what-makes-googles...</a><p>The Google Street View photography of my former neighborhood in Panchiao, Taiwan is PHENOMENAL, and data like that are being gathered all over the world.

5109396,comment,5109159,5109159,14,0,neya,,,"Here's my experience. It's not exactly the same, but it's worth a read.<p>Currently I have a very basic Nokia model. There is a process called 'handing over' or 'hand shake' that happens when you move from one cell (a small region of an entire area) to another or when one cellphone tower 'hands over' the signal to another tower. This process is handled exceptionally well on most smartphones, but not so well on the basic phones such as lower-end Nokias.<p>So, if you were in the middle of a call and this handshake happens (mostly when you are traveling) and if it isn't done on time, or if it isn't done right, the call is dropped.<p>Previously I had a HTC Desire S, which I dropped from the top of a building by mistake and hence I ended up with this Nokia. Now, this Nokia had frequent call drops and it won't even notify me when it happens. It got irritating after a point, because I would still keep talking assuming the other person is still listening (while on a call) only to realize that I would have to repeat whatever I just said.<p>One day, I got so angry, because it was an important call, I just thrashed the phone on to the ground <i>on purpose</i>. Luckily, only the display broke, but the phone would still function normally.<p>Here's my experience with this phone:<p>1) Previously, on my HTC, all my 2000+ contact would be synced from my google account automatically. There was zero effort needed on my part, so, basically I had everyone's number on my phone synced automagically - My family, Friends on Facebook, Friends on whtasapp, etc.<p>With this nokia phone, I would have to manually save each number to the phone (which has only a max. of 500 contacts) also it's a tedious process, because I'd need to type them manually. Since the display is gone now, I need to memorize the numbers of important people. And I could feel in a week's time, my ability to memorize (which was previously rusty) has actually improved. With a smartphone, I didn't have to memorize anything - While convenient, it's dangerous, sometimes. For example, I once needed to recall someone's number to deliver my movie tickets at a particular place and I had actually forgotten their number. It was a nightmare.<p>And it's not just numbers, I actually have the workflow memorized too - To access phonebook, press right right select. To access recent calls - down down left. Stuff liek that. It's ugly, but it gets the job done.<p>2) Productivity. I'm a heavy Facebook user. Or I was, rather. I realized, my smartphone alone was responsible for over 80% of the status updates and photos uploaded to my account. It was a content producer by itself. Now that it is no more, I feel the urge to use the platform has considerably decreased, because I don't have a camera phone now and I haven't uploaded anything much since my phone broke.<p>3) Savings. I saved a LOT. No data plans meant cheaper monthly rates and no phone book meant memorizing only important people's numbers and calling fewer people. I do have a back up of my contacts on my google account though.<p>4) Safety. I don't walk on the streets typing some random shit on my Android qwerty keyboard nor do I talk to someone over the bluetooth headset while driving. This is subjective, though - Not everyone does all this with their smartphones.<p>5) No screening. Since my phone doesn't have a display, I wouldn't be able to see who's calling me. If I miss them, I will never get to know who had called me either. So, sometimes, if the phone rings, I just answer and say 'hello' and talk to whoever it is, instead of ignoring people by their name (sometimes to avoid them on purpose, because I would be busy with something). I realized how much I missed out by categorizing certain people as boring. Again, this is a subjective thing.<p>6) Battery. This phone lasts for almost 2 weeks. My HTC would last only a little less than a day. It's a huge difference. No charging or low battery woes.<p>All in all, I'm a productive person, comparatively and a more <i>real-world friendly</i> guy - instead of taking pictures of pancakes and uploading them to instagram, I just fucking eat them.",1359034600

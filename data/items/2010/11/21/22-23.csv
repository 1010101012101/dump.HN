A simple way to avoid most masturbatory use of such spaces is to prevent people from being able to view pictures of other people who are naked.<p>Even if it were prudishness, then what right do you have to dictate to the ""prudish"" what their attitude to nudity or sexual imagery in public spaces should be?",1290380353

A degree is largely a check mark on a check box for a perfect little life of doing what you're told. Now, if people think that having a degree means X then they are free to do that and will reap the consequences.<p>Honestly, why should the students bother to come up with original work when the professor can't even be bothered to create original tests? Why is it not 'cheating' for the professor to use another persons test?<p>Obviously, what's on the test was taught in the class, so why not use an abridged format of the information that makes it unnecessary to learn information not relevant to the course?

1928100,comment,1927903,1927903,0,0,kroo,,,"While I feel the OP's pain in terms of difficulty working with the limitations of AppEngine, what he's not mentioning is the collection of benefits you get from AppEngine over other services.  We've found that once you work out a solution to the datastore and request timeout issues, you have a remarkably robust and scalable system for free (or at least out-of-the-box).<p>With AppEngine, I've never had to migrate a database schema, build a load-balancer, hire a fulltime sysadmin, or even pay for servers that arn't receiving traffic.  I don't have to set up a large-scale deployment system, nor spin up a new database server when traffic gets too heavy.  AppEngine so far has been remarkably cheap (we're starting to bring in more customers however, so we'll see how long this lasts).<p>Many of the challenges he mentions come down to thinking about writing a webapp with a longer-term vision in mind.  Datastore limitations crop up when you outgrow your first datastore in a standard system; in AppEngine they're properly enumerated and dealt with from day 1.  Likewise long-running connections become very tricky to deal with with lots of traffic... this point is a little harder to argue with the recent popularity of asynchronous-io servers, but I think Google is working hard on these limitations.  SSL is just annoying;  we've had to deal with this by adding an SSL proxy until Google adds SSL support -- but it sounds like Google is pretty close to solving this one (it's been promised by end of year).<p>Also, AppEngine is written in a very high-level way;  should you reach a point where AppEngine no longer makes sense, it is amazingly easy to transition over to another system (as the OP apparently found out;  I would give more credit to the design patterns inherent in the AppEngine APIs than 'TDD driven development').  Tornado, webpy, etc have virtually the same interface as AppEngine's webapp framework.<p>There are definitely tradeoffs when choosing AppEngine as a production backend right now, and its certainly not the right solution for every problem... but for many people, us included, its been a pretty large net benefit for our startup.  Google is actively improving the system, and I expect many of these problems will go away in the next 6 months or so.",1290379466

You should never do a job that loses you money just for the sake of winning the job.<p>Estimation on any project is a matter of breaking it down to the smallest components. Estimate each component with a high/low bracket (i.e. best case and worst case).

You will repeat concepts.<p>However, duplicate code is the greatest sin in software design.  Almost every good practice or rule we have conjured is an attempt to reduce code duplication.  Redemption comes in the form of abstraction.  How could anyone defend duplicate code?<p>The author mentioned two kinds of duplication in tests.  The first is a case of ""You're doing it wrong.""  Here is a good rule of thumb for tests: if you find yourself copy-pasting between the code you wrote and the test you write for that code, you are not testing the code.  Find an alternative way to test it.  You will find a lot more value in it.<p>The second is a discussion of setup and teardown being repeated.  You are writing a lot of extra noise.  Perl's Test::Class, for example, allows you to write <i>one</i> setup and teardown for all the tests in a Test::Class child.  Reduce copy-paste by grouping together classes of tests.  Even without a nice test framework, setup and teardown are trivial to implement yourself.  Don't write tests that are a series of lines in one large main function.<p><i>Sometimes you can factor out this duplication. However, in less dynamic languages like C, it may not always be easy to do so.</i><p>What does this ""less dynamic"" mean?  The example is easy to refactor into a function for both:<p><pre><code>    stuff(1);\n    call_something_unrelated();\n    stuff(2);\n</code></pre>\nC can abstract.

If teaching honest students, it just doesn't sound like an efficient use of teaching resources to re-invent the wheel each time.<p>And there are objective benefits to using the same or similar tests from year to year. One is that you can see if your class is improving or lagging in specific areas compared with previous classes. That could help you hone your teaching over the years.

We were instructed that if a potential buyer asked us if a car had been involved in accident, we were to shrug and say ""we don't know"" even if it was clear to us that it had been. Whenever I was asked I told the truth...most of which then didn't buy the car. When I lost one too many ""done deal"" sales, I lost my job. I had to go find another one. but at least I never had to go home and cry myself to sleep for being a cheating, lying scumbag.<p>These people aren't ""drafted"" to fight a cause they don't believe in, these are people voluntarily doing a job they signed up to do.

Value is the valuation of others, it exists in the minds of other people.

I've tried it before, and believe me, Django absolutely sucks on Appengine.<p>First off, you have a full featured framework which was designed for SQL relational databases.  Many of Django's features either have to be given up, or are monkey-patched beyond belief to get partial functionality.  Not to mention quite a few Django apps use database features which are simply not supported by BigTable.<p>Secondly, Django is not exactly the smallest framework, so loading time can be quite expensive and will be tacked on to every cold start.<p>All that being said, I've had good success with the tornado framework.  It's fast, well written, and thoughtfully designed.  Check out my profile if you want to see some examples of apps written with tornado + GAE.",1290377237

When he refers to polish, he is referring to code which he has already thought out which will eventually not be repetitive, so applying DRY is easily dismissed as not applicable in that instance. Applying DRY never usually means that you will create branches, etc. You do that if you are writing modular code. The whole point in DRY is that you do not repeat yourself. Good OO DRY code never commonly suffers the need to do what he is describing.\nWriting DRY code is actually faster than copying and pasting whole chunks but only if you have a very good understanding of the code. A good reason I can see to not use DRY techniques is if you do not have the skill level required to write DRY code because you are unfamiliar with an included library of classes for instance.<p>As far as scrubs, he's referring to someone as doing a job which he thinks he is above when it would benefit his project if there where many eyes on the same thing instead. If he understood his libs and tools well enough, he wouldn't need a ""Scrub."" What use would they be anyway if they are new to the language? How are they going to spot that cross site scripting hole you've copied and pasted five times everywhere? Most people doing the job which he describes make a poor effort because it is well known that developers who are not adding new features are largely disinterested in their work.<p>My point is that if you learn properly how to write DRY code, you avoid large fixes that involve searching through the entire code for particular strings. If you use OO DRY techniques, your fixes are in one place and are made quickly. There is nothing slow about writing DRY code and very few real disadvantages (None of which he has pointed out.) So if you learn to write DRY code properly you should see your development time slashed by sometimes by as much as three quarters. You will also have considerably less code to maintain.<p>It's nothing personal. My experience tells me that he is yet to use DRY techniques correctly and if he needs a ""Scrub,"" to tighten up the code, it is almost always faster to just re-write the entire project using DRY techniques instead. If you write code and then try to make it DRY, you have completely misunderstood the point of DRY.",1290376821

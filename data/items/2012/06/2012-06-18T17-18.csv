4127659,comment,4124275,4127138,7,0,slurgfest,,,"I'm not trying to construct a straw man, I'm trying to talk about the lay of the land. If I have a beef it is with the irrational, undisciplined, non-illuminating, petty dullness of the whole argument.<p>Because in the many times I have seen this argument, it always seems to go the same way. There is a Philistine sneering at some boring or obscure objects, and there is an angry Defender of Art who treads a fine line between (on one hand) a bland modern schoolteacher's orthodoxy which says nothing can be excluded and (on the other hand) a haughty attitude that the boring object is really better than some other boring objects - you know, to those with REAL discernment - and that the Philistine probably loves airbrush art and Thomas Kinkade and the pre-Raphaelites (hee hee hee). There is a huge dogpile of smug people on the Philistine, whose populist persecution complex is encouraged. The Defender (who often enough is just an undergraduate with a little art history or a 35mm camera), is just fueling the Philistine, and the Philistine is fueling the Defender, and so on forever.<p>If I am bothered by any specific art, it is the pieces which use yet another random object to draw out this same discussion we have been having for over 50 years.<p>I don't really object to a totally stoned view of the world where everything is interesting period, and maybe it really is useless to talk about art. That seems to me at least consistent, and not a perpetuation of the same crummy drama used to endlessly propagate the modern orthodoxy. On the other hand, if someone wants to actually try excluding something from art then that also provides a starting point for an actual discussion of some kind.",1340042360

4127644,story,,,1,0,callmeed,"Ask HN: Do you like any of these hackathon ideas? ",,"Leading a small team of 2-3 people this coming weekend at AngelHack in SF. We're wrestling with a few different ideas so I thought I'd throw some out there for feedback. Here's some of our ideas:<p>1. DIY DAILY DEALS<p>Small businesses can create their own daily deals and accept payment via Stripe or Dwolla. Deals are published to their Facebook page and website, plus an API lets aggregators (like Yipit) pick them up. Integration with Passbook in iOS6 as well. I like this one but fear the daily deal space might be too saturated.<p>2. MOBILE VIDEO COACH<p>User uploads a video of themselves performing a sport. A professional coach then provides feedback and offers drills for improvement. Coaches set their own price for services. We have a golf coach, pro baseball player and martial arts/MMA instructor already on board to help with this if we do it. I like it but it seems a little niche.<p>3. BRICK-AND-MORTAR SALE APP<p>Every brick-and-mortar retailer from Best Buy to Gap has a sale/clearance rack. We would build a mobile app that lets retailers snap a picture of sale items and upload (with description). Some limits (say, only 5 items per week) would keep someone from flooding it and we could expand into ""what's new"" inventory. Consumers could then browse sale items nearby on the app.<p>4. ENDLESS TRIVIA<p>This one is still a little rough, but we were thinking of scraping Wikipedia and creating a never-ending source of multiple-choice trivia questions (things like ""Who won Super Bowl XX in 1986?"") ... the questions would then be used in some sort of mobile app.<p>Thanks!",1340042166

It's like trying to guess how much you will pay on gas on your daily commute without knowing the distance or the kind of car you're driving.<p>It depends how much work is done in each ""hit"". If 99% of those 10k hits are to display the 10 most recent entries in a table, a very small setup will take you very far. A couple of 96 MB Python front-ends, 64 MB for SQL, you would pay maybe about $40/mo for a decent setup.<p>Now if most of the hits trigger complex geographic queries against a database of millions of records, with a high write/read ratio, it's a whole different story. You need to know about the size of your working set (you can then infer your database memory requirements), and have a rough idea of the average request time and concurrency (to infer your number of workers, if you're using a synchronous server like most deployments of Django or Rails).<p>While the ""per-megabyte"" price will be higher than ""raw hosting"", keep in mind that the granularity will allow you to do huge savings. Instead of paying for this 1.7 GB instance, you can pay for just 200 or 300 MB of RAM if that's what your app requires :-)",1340040792

They day when most people are asking prime numbers greater then 87, I am sure Siri will be optimized for that.<p>And remember, Siri in its previous versions would send all recorded text to a server for processing, and a result would shoot back.  In current implementation, Siri is doing all voice process on the device and handling queries directly in realtime -- optimization have to be made and limits do have to be imposed.<p>There is a difference between making an application to show technical prowess, and an application that is actually going to be used by consumers to solve everyday problems.

4127441,comment,4124275,4124275,1,0,jenius,,,"For me, the best way to understand art is to compare it directly with music (and the comparison holds very well, as music is a form of art).<p>Think about pop music, and your feelings towards it. Many of my peers think that much of pop music is usually a bunch of crap and hardly ever listen to the radio (myself included). People love to proclaim which music is 'the best' and which music 'sucks', and they also love to argue about it endlessly. But if you look at this from a logical standpoint, you are a dog chasing your own tail if you want to argue about music opinions. You are pitting opinion against opinion, and there is nothing concrete to support either side, which makes it an utterly stupid and useless argument to have.<p>Let's add some logic to the music argument, then, to actually make it productive. Here's a good metric - which musician has the most fans and makes the most money off their music. If this is the metric you are viewing it from, you could most certainly say that pop is technically the ""best"" music out there, then prove it with numbers. And there would be no debating it.<p>But I bet there are a lot of people squirming to disagree with me at this point. And they wouldn't be wrong. Perhaps popularity isn't the metric that defines the word ""best"". In fact, the word ""best"" is a stupid word to use in arguments overall. Just replace that with ""most popular"", ""most lucrative"", or ""my personal favorite"", and we have an argument that can actually be carried out in a civil manner and solidly proven.<p>The words ""good"" and ""best"" ALWAYS mean ""in my opinion, good"" and ""in my opinion, the best"". And like music, art is all about opinions. You can call anything art, and you can call anything crap. If you can convince enough people to think your art is ""good"", it will then likely become more popular and lucrative. This part of it is all about psychology, and taking advantage of people and their emotions.<p>My personal opinion about art is that it is a piece that evokes emotion in the viewer and sends some message about the world that the artist is trying to get across. The ""better"" in my opinion the art is, the higher the percentage of viewers get this message, and the stronger it resonates with them.<p>Hope this helps...",1340039743

If these required a data connection to launch them they would be useless to me and therefore it would be pointless to own a smartphone. I know there are probably web equivalents with offline storage for one or two of these (although how do you know if a web app is really offline capable?) but its unrealistic <i>at this point in time</i> to say that the web can replace native apps feature for feature for most users especially with the current local database size limits for web apps.<p>The whole assumption of a constant connection thing really gets on my nerves and there are plenty of native apps which are hobbled by it.

For example, I truly hate the CalMac ferry app because it should just cache the timetable data in a CoreData (or a web app with offline database would work well too), its probably <100k of timetable data and it yet it tries to redownload a <i>PDF</i> for my ferry seemingly every time I try to access it......Grrrrrrr (timetable stashed in dropbox instead).<p>[1]About 1-3 bars of 2G signal.

These are ideal for beginners - they are only 5 minutes long, which forces you to get straight to the point. It also doesn't matter if you suck, because it will be over quickly - and the audience is likely to be very supportive.<p>2. Always, always make sure you've been through your talk SPEAKING OUT LOUD at least once (and preferably way more than once) - I prefer to do this in the privacy of a hotel room or similar. Until you've gone through the talk speaking to an empty room it's very hard to know if it's going to work or not.<p>3. Have backups of your slides. I tend to have a Keynote file on my laptop, and a copy of it (and a PDF export of it) on both a USB key and my Dropbox account just in case.<p>4. If you're going to attempt live demos, have a backup plan - static screenshots, or maybe a screencast-style video.<p>5. Remember: the audience are on your side. They want you to give a great talk, and they'll ignore any ums and aahs.

So node installs a version of the V8 engine in your dev environment, so it can run js on the server without a browser.<p>That's why jam requires node - it's written on javascript and uses node packages so it can work with the filesystem, and do other server/dev environment things that js in a browser can't do.<p>When you develop with node, it's just like doing development for any other language.<p>Edit: in case this wasn't clear - you aren't working in a node environment. In this case, node is simply used because it can execute javascript in a server environment. So jam can be written in js and do filesystem stuff if it runs using the node utility. Jam simply runs on node, but a project using jam doesn't necessarily need to be a node application.",1340038906

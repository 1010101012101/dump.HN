5703341,comment,5703097,5703193,36,0,tikhonj,,,"You're mistaking familiarity for simplicity. You cannot get much simpler than the lambda calculus, full stop. It has three concepts--lambdas, variables and application--and one evaluation rule. That is <i>all</i>. The rest of the language features are almost always just a thin layer over this.<p>Even when you add types, it's still an amazingly simple model. And the types do not generally affect the runtime behavior of code at all.<p>Functional languages are the very picture of something simple but not necessarily easy. Go, at least for you, is the opposite: it's easy because it's similar to what you're used to, but it also has quite a bit of surface area.<p>My impression is that Go vies for simplicity of implementation over simplicity of semantics. It is a very operational sort of language. Its goal is to make the <i>how</i> clear--the code reflects what it does.<p>Languages like Haskell, on the other hand, are completely the opposite. Haskell values simplicity of semantics over simplicity of implementation. It is a very denotational sort of language. Its goal is to make the <i>what</i> clear--the code reflects what it means.<p>It's a difference in philosophies, certainly, just not quite in the way you construed it to be.",1368514356

(1)Whenever any person finds any lost or abandoned property, such person shall report the description and location of the property to a law enforcement officer.</i>
...
(3)It is unlawful for any person who finds any lost or abandoned property to appropriate the same to his or her own use or to refuse to deliver the same when required.
(4)Any person who unlawfully appropriates such lost or abandoned property to his or her own use or refuses to deliver such property when required commits theft as defined in s. 812.014, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.*<p>Similar laws are on the books in many US jurisdictions.  It is actually quite common to bring police into these matters.  (P.S. You might reasonably think of e.g. an envelope with one paycheck worth of money as the upper bound on property likely to be found abandoned, but a lot of the legal cases for this sort of thing involve cash <i>hordes</i> or doing things like abandoning e.g. a building or very valuable capital machinery.)<p>There's a locally famous case in my neck of Japan where a construction company, hired to break ground on a new building, discovered approximately $300,000 in cash buried in a tin can.  It actually went before a magistrate, quite unusually for Japan, because it was very unclear who owned the money.  The ruling was that the construction company received 25% (for having legal control of the work site) and the workers received 75% (for having actually found the money), while the land owner received 0%, because they had ""no cognizable interest in property which they were unaware existed"", and the (unknown) owner of the property had forfeited any interest in it by abandoning it in circumstances where they could not reasonably have precluded others from accessing it.<p>The court might have been smiling as it said that, particularly to the land owner, because the ""Everybody knows it and nobody is saying it"" conclusion was that the only reason somebody buries $300k and refuses to acknowledge it when it is unearthed is because the money is dirty.

No, not everyone can really ""get something"" by going to graduate school. And not everyone that does go to graduate school is going to succeed because of it. But to say that graduate school is useless, or that it makes you a bad candidate for jobs, is just stupid. Personally, I don't want to work for a company that doesn't value education.<p>I went to graduate school, busted my ass all day every day, and landed a great job before I graduated just this past Saturday. Is that the story that everyone in gradschool gets to tell? No. But getting a job isn't the reason I went to gradschool in the first place. And building a house isn't the reason you walk into a hardware store. You go to the store to get the tools, and you speak with professionals to get the knowledge. Then you are better equipped to tackle real tasks when the time comes to use those tools.<p>Master's degree in the humanities is useless? I landed a 48K starting salary job. Do I have 60K in loan debt? Yeah. But you know what? I'll have it paid off in two years. Because it's called an investment. Investments can pay off if you make them do it, and if you can't that doesn't mean it was a bad investment, it just means you were unable to make it pay off.<p>These people that complain about graduate school are just bad investors, they can't see potential, and they are discussing a machine that they can't understand. It's fine that they do it, and I'm glad that they feel as though they are making a good point. But I've got no patience for them, because they are discussing things that they have no understanding of, and it's like being back in grad school where the bad students tried to act like they did the work but didn't.

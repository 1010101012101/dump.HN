Such an opinion has a strong correlation with racism, it&#x27;s worth noting: Detroit must be the perilous worst because it is held to represent black America.<p>As to the &quot;never actually visited&quot;, do you claim that most, or even a <i>remote minority</i> of Americans have &quot;actually ever visited Detroit&quot;? Of course they haven&#x27;t. They laugh and point and repost and share the ruin porn because, ha ha, look at Detroit.<p>In any case, it was a pretty bizarre claim to use in response to my post given that I expressly said that I go to Detroit almost regularly. Indeed, &quot;Canadians&quot; in Southern Ontario almost certainly know more about Detroit than the bulk of Americans, for obvious geographical and practicality reasons.<p>Now maybe I&#x27;m not going to the &quot;real&quot; Detroit in some people&#x27;s opinion, in that I am in built up urban areas and affluent suburbs, but it is a part of the whole of Detroit.",1400504326

They won&#x27;t know which server is responsible (or if maybe the GFW is kicking in) and there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it.<p>From the point of server operators, with mandantory CA signatures they have to decide if they&#x27;re rather willing to drop perfectly fine connections or if they&#x27;re accepting &quot;secure&quot; connections subverted by parties they weren&#x27;t willing to trust in the first place.",1400504271

It&#x27;s not the mental state you are in during the  meditation that brings the long term benefits. What works is your constant effort to look at your mind and notice  what it does, even when you are distracted or feel vexed and especially then.<p>When you do 7 day zazen retreat where you meditate 10-16 hours per day, you  feel pain in your legs, periods of intense drowsiness, agitation, strong emotions, boredom, etc. all this while sitting and looking calm outwards. Within all this internal storm you are just  looking at what happens your own mind at the current moment. Attaching yourself to pleasant mental states you get in meditation is just waste of time.<p>The way these EEG devices work is by giving you feedback loop that gets you into relaxed state.

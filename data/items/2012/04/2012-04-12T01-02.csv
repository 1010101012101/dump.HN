They can effectively shut out what are legitimate apps for whatever agenda they want to push (anti-competitive or otherwise) and back it up with any bogus citation of their restrictive ToS.  The idea of Dell or Apple able to dictate what we can or cannot install on our computers would be absurd yet we're paving the way for such a future as smartphones get smarter while such policies remain in place.<p>At least book/content publishers have other avenues to disseminate their content.",1334195823

This is like gardening on someone else's land.

This is perhaps why most decorators in the standard library are pure (off the top of my head).<p>This is well beyond the scope of the post but an important and often overlooked point in my opinion.",1334195422

However I believe he severely discounts the level of groupthink in our current culture and how prevalent this brand association is in people's minds. Especially in older more traditional businesses these associations still act as a powerfull barrier to entry into most groups.

3830573,comment,3830185,3830471,4,0,samdk,,,"The Python community generally advocates an ""it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission"" coding style. When faced with a condition of the form ""if condition a holds, do b, else c"", it's very often a better idea to do ""let's try b, and do c in case b fails because condition a didn't hold"".<p>In this case it's better because you can avoid computing an extra hash of the object in cases where it's already a key of the dictionary. This may seem like a silly optimization, but it can very easily add up if you're accessing existing elements most of the time--I once had a bit of code that went 60x faster when I replaced an if-else with a try-except.<p>In other cases it can be even more beneficial. Say you're opening a file. One approach to avoid errors would be to check if a file exists first. This is error-prone because the file might cease to exist in between the 'if' and the 'open' statements, and now you have no code written to handle the error. Using try-except will ensure that you actually handle the error intelligently.<p>This isn't to say there's never a good reason to use an 'if' to check things, just that if you can do it in one step instead of two, one is usually better.",1334194628

One, a lot of big ISPs (from what I've read) are only profitable due to selling clickstreams or other privacy-invading things.  So a privacy-protecting ISP will cost more for the same service (or, will offer crappier bandwidth).<p>Second, once you move beyond this level of security, you're trying to defeat traffic analysis, and then targeted attacks.  Targeted attacks are probably out of scope (and really expensive to defend against), but defending against traffic analysis usually requires burning a lot of bandwidth, or scheduling or routing communications in strange ways (which adds latency in various ways).  This makes things REALLY expensive, and especially for wireless systems, uses up the finite spectrum capacity.<p>Ultimately the best way to really protect privacy is to structure applications to be message based, tolerant of latency on the order of hours, and basically non-interactive.  This is the opposite of how ~everything is done on the web -- email is probably the only widely deployed application which works like this, and that's why email has the best anti-traffic-analysis systems out there (mixmaster/mixminion remailers).<p>Plus, there's a big problem with declaring yourself ""<i>the</i> ISP for people who want to be anonymous"" -- it self-selects, especially if it's a small pool of users due to higher cost, into a great target.  Either the organization itself is evil and secretly monitoring, or just becomes a hacker/government target (which could involve monitoring on the perimeter/upstream).  The best model is some combination of making privacy protection a default feature of protocols, having a bunch of different vendors (which may advertise better privacy) to choose from, and having technical systems which can provably protect your secrets against various kinds of threats.<p>It's a bunch of medium and hard problems.

They have given the users a transition period to use the new layout.<p>This is total bullshit. That's a fairly recent change for Facebook. For a long time they rolled out changes to the UI without warning. Hell, they'd even break <i>documented APIs</i> frequently. Even ""breaking"" API changes only get 30 days warning, and that 30 day minimum window was set in <i>2011</i> after developer complaints!<p>Extensions based on specific HTML structure in a third-party service will often break, and spectacularly so. It's not as if Google+ broke APIs without warning - they redesigned a site. Google never asked anyone to write extensions that change the look/function of Google+, and having done so doesn't mean they owe you a thing.",1334193502

There is no math journal where you can publish the tips you calculated. It's not their job, there are no theorems to be proven there, etc., etc.<p>(You're actually doing it a little more complicated than it has to be because it sounds like you're spending a little memory remembering the number you took 10% of. Take half, add it to the original, which is presumably still right in front of you, then drop the digit after.)<p>I learned a lot of mental calculation because my background is in applied physics, where you're expected to reason about the size of things etc. (A good example question might be, ""how far do you think an air molecule can go before it bumps into another air molecule?"")<p>So, just for example, to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit you multiply by 2, subtract 10%, and add 32. It is exact. So 25C  50  45  77F. To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius you subtract 32, divide by 2, add 10%, then add 1% if you really feel like it; it is approximate. So 52F  20  10  11  11.11C. Those sorts of things I will do in my head when people give me a number in one or the other temperature. Tipping is especially nice when compared to the fact that in New York State there is an 8% sales tax which is not added to any of the prices on stuff at the store -- calculate a tip and halve it.<p>[Naive reasonings on air: small upper bounds can be given by the fact that it has to travel easily through the small passageways in your inner ear, but my favorite calculation is to take (kinematic viscosity) / (speed of sound), both of which are things that an applied physics geek should roughly know.]",1334192738

When there can only be one of something - and there are good reasons for not federating biometrics databases - then it makes sense for the government to offer that service, rather than private enterprise.<p>On top of this, build a contract infrastructure - a set of technical standards for digitally signed contracts - this could be free market, but the standards body should again be unitary, so that contract standards are singular. Hence, the standards body is quasi-governmental.<p>This is infrastructure which is essential to commerce, but - because of the namespace issues - it cannot be entirely provided by the free market, which would naturally tend to fragment the namespace. You can see an entire parallel chain of development with DNS.<p>Power grid: do not offer, do not want. <a href=""http://smallisprofitable.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallisprofitable.org</a><p>Similar approaches for water supply and sewage treatment: set standards for those offering the services, sue those who fall below those standards, leave it to the market. This stuff used to be unitary-provider 200 years ago, which is why govt. still does it now, but technology has moved on.<p>I have a couple of not-read-for-prime-time papers on the concept I've been working on for disaster relief called ""State In A Box"" that I can pass along if you are interested: hexayurt@gmail.com <a href=""http://hexayurt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hexayurt.com/</a>",1187528003

That solves the authentication and updating problems. That's not my idea either.

That is, if I just type in Pennsylvania, it will take me to that area.  This will be even more needed when you start from the world view.

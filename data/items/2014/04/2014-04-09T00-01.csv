It&#x27;s fine if it&#x27;s made up, your goal is to learn, not to build The Next Big Thing, right?<p>Another piece you might add to the stack at some point is a BPM engine like Activiti.<p>This approach might or might not be for you (learning styles differ and all that), but &quot;build something&quot; has always worked best for me.<p>Also, and hopefully without being too self-promotional - if you want to hack on some of this stuff in the setting of a cool open source project, I have some stuff I&#x27;m working with that uses Grails, Camel, JMS, (not so much CXF though, at least not at the moment) and Activiti.

Hmm, so you&#x27;re saying Quranic Arabic is like sms style<p>No I&#x27;m saying that sms arabic is a transliteration or arabic into latin script, despite very different alphabets. Obviously it&#x27;s possible. I find it fascinating, because there&#x27;s actually multiple styles of doing this. But I like the version where they use numbers to complete the set of letters. Reminds me of old French texts that also have a &quot;3&quot;-shaped letter lost in the middle of words instead of the modern letter, and those were some of the first non-mother-tongue texts I read. Fairy tales. I think I&#x27;m getting old.<p>> Wrong again. Vowels ARE part of both languages.<p>In modern arabic, sort-of (spoken, yes, written, not really, same as in hebrew really, which is to say, not at all (say different vowels and people will still understand you), but yes you can put little marks on the letters now indicating which vowel to use in &quot;most&quot; cases. I was told this is mainly done for children&#x27;s first reads though, and not done in normal handwritten texts). In ancient (written) arabic, it is never done.<p>Obviously the arabs living in the 8th century still used vowels, just not in writing.<p>As for Luxenberg&#x27;s thesis, buy his book and read it. It has chapters full of those verses.<p>> The language of the Quran did play a role in converting people back when it was revealed, because it was unique -- yet still understandable.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that just further confirm this situation though ? It&#x27;s &quot;unique&quot;, is that perhaps a polite way of saying that it&#x27;s very different from anything else you&#x27;ve ever read, with &quot;weird&quot; verb forms, words with wrong roots and the like ?<p>I guess I don&#x27;t fully understand what you&#x27;re saying. Either it&#x27;s &quot;unique&quot; arabic, or it&#x27;s not, right.

I hope none of you will argue the belief that the brain and the human body are both so complex that we are nowhere near fully understanding not only &quot;it&quot; and what &quot;it&quot; is in it&#x27;s entirety and it&#x27;s role in the world, but more importantly that we don&#x27;t even know how it works.  Some of you may agree with me in saying that we may never know everything about the human body/mind.  (And by never I simply mean the foreseeable future.)<p>One day soon I hope the industry changes into a field where it goes undebateable that while yes, the human mind and body could quite possibly be one of the most complex systems we&#x27;ve ever seen in nature... it is still much different than the human mind.  When we treat the human mind as something different from the human brain we stop becoming victims and take more control over our lives.<p>I think we need to stop simply &quot;treating the brain and observing the mind.&quot;\nWhat I mean by this is the practice of Psychiatrists and their willingness to prescribe medication like a band-aid patching up deeply rooted emotional issues.  IMO it is not only wrong, but detrimental to believe that behavior is the outcome and not the cause.\nI am a behaviorist at heart (maybe fool-heartedly) but I believe that the human brain in the natural world is so complex... that in a sense, it has created something potentially destructive to itself.  What I mean by this, put very simple, is the ability to make ourselves believe that something exists.  Whether it&#x27;s a dependency (OCD, Food) or man-made fear itself (think scary movie - cabin in the dark woods), we have the ability to make these things real. Not real in the physical world, but real enough in our personal world.  When bad things happen to us in the physical world, our body reacts.  When a loved one passes away, you feel the pain, and often find yourself becoming more vulnerable to sickness from the stress.<p>When I was about 10 or 11 I bought an old crystal at a flea market that was so big I could hardly fit it in my palm.  I liked it, and I liked owning it but never paid much attention to it until one day my Grandmother noticed that I had been carrying it around.  She told me to sit down and she began telling me a story about how supposedly crystals are so powerful that some people claim that they can heal you when you&#x27;re sick simply by holding them.  She began telling how she knew of some people who specifically wore jewelry with crystals attached with nothing but the pure intention of gaining some kind of fortifying health benefits.  I was so mystified by this idea of a powerful healing stone I began to carry this crystal around.  I carried it around in my hand for most of that day and the following day it was in my pocket and later under my pillow when I slept.  The length of time of this was 2 days, 1 night. By the second night I was overcome by a nauseating sickness.<p>As a kid I was so mystified by the coincidence.  I figured that the crystal had to have been so powerful that it had the opposite effect on me and became too string of a healing stone.<p>I wont get into whether or not the power of crystals is something real or not.  The irony in this story is that a couple of years later I found that same crystal lying around in a box somewhere.  It had yellowed and felt slightly malleable to the touch as though if I pressed into it too hard with my thumbnail it might leave an imprint.<p>It was a fake.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a crystal, is wasn&#x27;t quartz.  It was all in my head.  \nI made myself sick because I believed in something so hard.  This is the type of sickness that psychiatrists are running in place trying to remedy.<p>Of course there is a little more to the story but I&#x27;ll cut it short here.<p>As for the article, I&#x27;m not sure, but I can tell you I&#x27;ve had much more anger come from fixing cars and working on engines than any video game could ever create inside of me.  The difference is that it&#x27;s very easy to walk away in a fit of rage after working on an engine.  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, or if there is any difference other than rage created from a video game will get much more attention than a motorhead restoring an old car.  That would mean that the difference is only based on perspective.<p>Just a thought, FWIW.",1397003236

Firstly, its author, Mircea Popescu, has a long history of not being the most trustworthy character, and often deliberately incites flamewars. I say this not to discredit the arguments in the post by discrediting their author (that would be fallacious), but to warn readers against taking his words at face value.<p>Now, on to the points in the post.<p>><i>As best as anyone can currently discern, Bitcoin does not have a core group of developers.</i><p>There is, in fact, a group of developers which contribute the bulk of the new code to the Bitcoin-Qt client. This includes essential security updates and new features. They also have a certain degree of leadership in the Bitcoin community, and their word was enough to get a majority of miners to switch to one client version during the hardfork (more on that later).<p>> <i>The “Bitcoin Foundation” / “Core Devs” group of scammers have quite publicly, and repeatedly, promoted and vouched for Butterfly Labs, aka BFL</i><p>I am not a fan of BFL. Whether they are malicious or incompetent does not matter with respect to the financial damage they have done. More importantly, they did not provide adequate compensation for their unrealized promises after the damage was done. However, I will need to see evidence of the Bitcoin Foundation endorsing BFL before I believe it. Additionally, while one or more developers may have endorsed BFL, this does not mean all developers which contribute frequently are in a cabal together.<p>> <i>The “Bitcoin Foundation” / “Core Devs” group of scammers have quite publicly, and repeatedly, promoted and vouched for MtGox</i><p>Please see my above response and substitute &quot;MtGox&quot; for &quot;BFL&quot;.<p>> <i>Systematically attempted to block, slow and hinder protocol specification and development</i><p>Such an accusation requires evidence.<p>> <i>Deliberately and quite maliciously created a blockchain hardfork in March 2013</i><p>Without evidence, we should assume it was accidental, not deliberate. In fact, I would assert that the evidence we have strongly implies that the fork was accidental. The hardfork only occurred because of a specific block that was &quot;too big&quot; (simplification). Additionally, the bug which caused it existed for a while before the fork occurred. Then, many of the core devs worked with miners to resolve the fork in such a way that every client managed to reunite on one chain.<p>> <i>which allowed our enemies - whoever they may be - to effectually stress-test the entire project</i><p>This is a nonsensical statement. The fork revealed no new &quot;weakness&quot;.<p>> <i>Deliberately and quite maliciously tried to meld the BleedingHeart openssl vulnerability into the Bitcoin code.</i><p>Again, we should assume they did not know of the vulnerability. If they did, then this point should be expanded upon and not blended with the rest of this post.<p>The post ends with vaguely threatening text which I will not quote here.",1397002117

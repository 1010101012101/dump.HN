The gist was that it offered monetary rewards to people who would discover prior art potentially usable in court to have a patent revoked. The latest piece of info I found about the site's demise was the following: http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2003/bountyquest_1003.html<p>I'm wondering, has anything similar ever been attempted since then? It seems like a pretty straightforward idea: you pay people to look up info on a certain patent, you reward the valuable answers (evaluating these results is all but simple, and likely why the venture failed in the end, but that's another point altogether).<p>Has it really not been done ever since?<p>Thanks!",1325231987

Wow. Apologies for venting, but this is fucking ludicrous. I am a middle-class mid-20s programmer who purchased a Stratfor subscription because their material is incredibly well-researched and about a million times more enlightening than your average CNN article. And now I have to cancel my credit card and deal with fraud services. Thanks a ton, Anonymous.<p>Congratulations, you've exposed the personal details of the rich bankers and military analysts that recognized Stratfor as the intelligent news service it is. And in the process, you've managed to completely alienate the rest of the Stratfor community, members of the ""99%"", who care enough about understanding global politics that they were willing to give up a portion of their hard-earned paychecks to become better-informed.

If he fails, and particularly if he does so in a spectacular fashion, public sentiment may turn and go in the other direction, saying that such big projects really should be done by governments, because they are the only entities powerful enough to make grand goals happen. I am not against him or SpaceX or settling Mars, but it is quite irresponsible for him to say that he will put 10,000 people on Mars in only 10 to 20 years. Anyone with two neurons to rub together should be alarmed at such a statement, and should think twice about getting into a rocket built by him. Put 10 people on the moon, and have them survive for a year. Then, and only then, make some cautious, speculative statements about Mars. A space entrepreneur grounded in reality is more likely to succeed, but if he fails, said grounding will give those who follow a greater likelihood of success, rather than having their opportunity snatched away by a government riding on a new-found wave of public fear.",1325231377

If I have a really good ladle, that works noticeably better than any other ladle I have ever had, then each time I pour soup, I get to contemplate the many flashes of brilliance and care that went into designing and making this ladle.   As I pour soup and contemplate the design of the ladle, I become a better engineer myself even, pondering how the makers thought to curve the side just so, etc.<p>And that is EASILY worth $20.00 and 15 minutes looking at reviews.",1325229233

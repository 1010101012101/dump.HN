Both parents died as I grew up, and once her mother died (maybe after 2004?) and all the bureaucracy and bribes she was so disgusted she never went back.  Years later, we were talking about Egypt and she said things like that would never happen in Syria, ever!  And now look at the ironic state of things.  Her sister still lives in Damascus.  And when we talked recently, first time in years, and that came up, she almost cried.  But it was out of sheer anger.  People I meet do not even care about the emotional loss, but how they have watched their country implode so rapidly while everyone voluntarily fucks it up more.<p>Thanks, for the tip about SAMS.

I still follow its advice to this day when having to brave the 101.<p>It discussed traffic waves and our reactions to them.  The repeatable waves this article mentions come from (most of) the individual drivers driving faster than the capacity of the road to carry them all.  So they bunch up at some point, catching those in front, everyone slows down for a bit and then the bunch &quot;evaporates&quot; from the front... repeat.  Those who get out of the slowdown speed to the next one.  It also discussed the effects of merging, which have a high cost as lanes get fuller, also why you&#x27;ll see lights at on-ramps to mitigate.<p>The recommendation was to slow down, leave plenty of space ahead for others to merge, and try to get going at as close to a single speed as possible to conserve momentum, gas, wear & tear, nerves, etc.  If packed enough you can let the car idle push you along around 5mph/8kph, which is what I aim for in that situation.  Feels better than speed-up/break/slow-down over and over.<p>It also responded to questions such as, &quot;what if everyone around me wants me to go faster?&quot;  It happens, but those people tend to drive off in a huff.  Once one or two of them do, you&#x27;ll find a more relaxed driver behind you for the rest of the trip.  The impatient driver won&#x27;t get ahead much anyway so you can wink at them when you catch up at the next slowdown.",1432190662

The language is always playing a game of its own and a lot of your level of expertise depends on how well you&#x27;ve bothered to learn the rules of that game.<p>For example, exceptions, as decribed in the article. Exceptions themselves make sense in some scope: they model some cases of error handling and controlled longjmping really well while are totally unsuited for other cases where a more fine-grained control of failure is necessary. Thus, exceptions themselves are applicable to an extent in a certain scope.<p>However, in C++, the scope where exceptions actually do work is even more narrow than the scope where exceptions would generally fit. Like explained in the article, the FQA, and this thread, there are numerous pitfalls where exceptions totally break and a number of assumptions you have to make but can&#x27;t guarantee. This reduces down to a few &quot;known almost safe ways&quot; of using them with a lot of &quot;ifs&quot; bundled in, and you need to explicitly know those ways.<p>Unlike in C, in C++ you can&#x27;t deduce what works and what doesn&#x27;t out of merely reading or writing code: you have to have enough experience to know these pitfalls first hand so that you know how to avoid them and why. There&#x27;s basically a line drawn in sand of what is known to work and what is not, like medical remedies in ancient cultures.<p>And further, all this effort is only really needed to deal with the language itself. It&#x27;s not required to solve the programming challenge at hand. It&#x27;s something that is not needed with C because you can reason with C on a &quot;what I see is what I have&quot; basis.",1432189619

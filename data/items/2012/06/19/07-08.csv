With the iPad, you can type text and use a couple of system commands (homescreen, brightness, music controls). But you still have to reach up and swipe through apps and touch the app you want to load, swipe to shift between apps, etc etc.<p>But with Windows 8, every touch gesture or feature is baked in intelligently to keyboard/trackpad use. Swiping between apps, bringing up charms, splitting the screen, selecting tiles on the start screen, etc etc. I think this will make a huge difference. Microsoft has an advantage here because W8 has been built simultaneously for all of these usage models, whereas Apple started with touch and is still tethered to a fingers-only UI basis.",1340092487

The action against me includes a claim of defamation and this precludes Legal Aid.<p>Pro bono is available, but generally comes with many restrictions. Example: Must live within this catchment area, or be a woman victim of abuse, etc.<p>Where pro bono isn't restricted I've found that the lawyers are over-loaded and unable to take on any more. I've contacted a number of lawyers, and with the kindest apologies they've had to decline but then recommend someone else. The recommendations have formed a large circular loop, I've tried them all.<p>There are legal clinics. Attending a CAB (Citizens Advice Bureau) will generally see you referred to one. By and large these are operated by local small solicitor firms. Some legal clinics are much better funded and organised.<p>I attended SWLAC (South Westminster Legal Advice Clinic). Which is sole-funded by a barrister who wishes to remain anonymous. Largely these clinics deal with housing issues and fairly simplistic cases for the most vulnerable. So when I presented my case to them for advice (how to respond, interpreting the law and whether I'd got it right), they were quite challenged by it. For an hour on a Tuesday evening it's perhaps beyond their scope though they did their best.<p>Home insurance policies sometimes include Legal Defence cover. So I tried mine, which does have that cover. However I found that this cover is only available for a limited range of actions against you, and again does not cover anything that includes defamation.<p>The action against me purposefully conflates 2 things together... my role as the operator of a web site, and my role as a user of my own service. The claimant has attempted to argue that my use of my own service somehow removes the defences afforded to the operator of a site and would make me liable for the statements made by others on the site.

You said something like this would take 10 years to build and Prisjakt actually started 10 years ago. :-) They don't index everything of course but probably covers 99% of everything tech related and have been expanding in to new product segments all the time. Except the web site they of course do have phone apps which let you search for a product and then choose to display all the stores around you that carry that product and to what price and if they have it in stock. If you have a Swedish store selling anything online (or offline more and more) you ""have"" to exists on Prisjakt and have your full inventory with prices and stock status supplied to them. If you are among the cheapest stores on a popular product this of course will get you a lot of traffic. But there are more layers than just price indexing. They do have ratings and comments for all products and all stores. Myself personally would never buy anything from a store with bad reviews on Prisjakt, be it online or offline.<p>I would guess they started back in the days just scraping web sites on their own and then gradually got stores to supply them with ""price files"" that contained everything they needed. I know they have deals with create-your-own-web-shop businesses like Shopify and others so that these businesses create the price files automagically for every store THEY have.<p>As for revenue I believe that a store has to pay Prisjakt to actually have Prisjakt put up a clickable link to their web site. So if I search for Samsung Galaxy S III and go to the product page, I am presented with an array of stores carrying that phone, and I can click to go immediately to the stores own product page for Samsung Galaxy S III and go through with my purchase. If you don't pay it seems your website url is more hidden (on the store profile page) it's not clickable even their. You can also pay extra for having your logotype visible etc. They probably have a lot more going on as well.<p>2010 Prisjakt had $7.6M in revenue and made a $3.36M profit.",1340091991

There are various paths to get to that result, with most of them having to build on a network effect of the previous success. You have to provide value to both retailers, product owners and customers along the way.<p>An interesting way to approach it, which I don't think people has mentioned is to provide incentive for people to share/store their own shopping. Scan a slip with your phone and it stores it. Now you can easily create a new shopping list, and or remember what you bought.<p>Now you start building up this database. Now you go to retailers and say: Look, customers are using this app, why don't you make items available so people can search them before making their to-buy list?<p>As with any idea, this one has holes as well. How many people actually make to-buy lists? And would be willing to scan their slips to process what they bought? Interesting thought experiment none the less.",1340090889

You've assumed a walk across the street, but out here it's probably a mile and a half drive and 2 unpleasant parking lots.  That changes a lot of your scenarios -- while you'd be silly not to walk next door to save a few bucks, the time investment <i>in many US cities</i> is often too high to be worth going to cheaper shops.  Looked at in another way, if I'm looking for something specific and I discover that I can get it from a store that is in close range, the value proposition of immediacy and reduced frustration for me can lead to a sale for that retailer even if their price isn't great.<p>You're also considering the value proposition symmetrically, when you should be considering it asymmetrically.  That is, you're thinking ""the store that sells this for $15 wouldn't use this app, because then the store selling it for $10 would steal all their business.""  That's a crappy value proposition for the $15 store, but a <i>great</i> one for the $10 store.  Some stores might not use it, but those with better prices or better selections would basically consider it free advertizing.<p>Also, I'm pretty sure you're wrong about retailers not being able to compete if their prices are higher, and about this sort of app destroying those businesses.  We already have this scenario with grocery stores, where you can compare them just by reading the paper (or the online ads), and yet certain more costly stores still survive.  Maybe it's location/convenience, maybe it's unique selection, maybe it's customer service or return policies, or maybe it's that cute girl ringing up your groceries.<p>I think, ultimately, you're conceiving of this app as ""how do I get the best price on X within a Y block radius?"", whereas I'm conceiving of it as ""can I get X from anywhere at all within a Y block radius?"" and only secondarily ""can I save money on X?""

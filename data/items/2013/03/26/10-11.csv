For example, veganhealth.org (run by dietition Jack Norris) makes an good effort at being a good guide - Jack does a pretty good job of distilling lots of the hard stuff into digestible chunks (forgive the pun). But it's subject to the exact same pitfalls and hopeful thinking (a bit of ground flaxseed on toast will solve all your omega problems!) I've seen in dozens upon dozens of vegan promotional dietary guides.<p>Once you've decided to go vegan, you've made the jump to accepting that you will be eating an inadequate diet <i>to start with</i>. (Simple logic dictates that if you need supplements to fix gaps in your diet, it's inadequate in those areas). Maintaining proper nutrition and health is <i>unbelievably</i> complicated when you're starting at such a disadvantage.<p>See a doctor regularly and demand the appropriate blood tests that test for the specific dietary deficiencies that are normal on a vegan diet. Don't rely on a typical blood panel...which is designed for people on omnivorous diets -- diets for which almost all of the vegan dietary deficiencies simply don't occur.

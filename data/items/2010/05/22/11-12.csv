1370192,comment,1370149,1370190,0,0,sounddust,,,"In any case, it's deplorable to promise two people jobs as lifeguards in Virginia Beach, only to bait-and-switch them into something that was, at best, a job in a disgusting strip club (as the google street view of the address would indicate) and at worst, enslavement as sex workers.   I don't see what the point is in giving them the benefit of the doubt, given that what we already know about them indicates that they're total scumbags (and especially since experts, with years of experience in this area, posted in the thread to state with almost total confidence that it was an attempt at sex trafficking).<p>Also, there is a lot more info in that thread than what the one guy posted.  There was at least one other Metafilter user who spent time with the girls, and it's certain that the police are going to investigate given the attention, so it's likely we'll know more soon.",1274529421

1370190,comment,1370149,1370159,0,0,pdx,,,"To be sure, the original metafilter guy didn't like the look of it from the beginning.<p>The young women, however, thought he was full of it, until they found out it was a strip bar, at which point, they were convinced he was right, and had saved them.  It's this sudden about face on their part that seemed strange to me, till I reread the part of them getting off the bus and dealing with all of these people who were trying to help them.  That level of unexpected attention would lead anybody to assume they had narrowly avoided something terrible.<p>I agree that from the story told by the original metafilter guy, these women seemed to be potentially in real danger.  The women had a different opinion, however, up until they were descended upon by police and others, which surely must have freaked them out.<p>In the judgment of the two people who this was actually happening to, the guy was overreacting.  They continued to ignore him until they were freaked out by the people who met them at the bus.  Why do we assume their original assessment of the situation was wrong, while his was right?  Because they were ""young girls, far from home"".  Meanwhile, young men of that same age, are leading fire teams in Afghanistan.<p>My point, I guess, is that, we don't know anything about this, except what this guy is telling us.",1274529068

In fact, most large organizations have compliance requirements, which often map people with proper skills to proper titles and responsibilities in order to get the correct liability protection.<p>I can not imagine Google allowing some junior programmer to setup a little closet and run servers in there without contemplating cost, heat/cooling, network allocation, and priviledge management (i.e. what services are running where, why, and who's managing it).<p>However, the smaller the organization, I can see this happening. 8 man startups without a system administrator...

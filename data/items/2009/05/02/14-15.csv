589890,comment,589200,589200,0,0,NickSmith,,,"This is a great article.<p>With regard to the 'call to action', I wouldn't under estimate the difficulty in changing the context (duration, specificity or 'me'-centricity) of our judgments because:<p>a) our need to judge is not causeless. It arises for our self-concept and<p>b) changing our thoughts is nigh impossible if they conflict with what we fundamentally believe is true.<p>So this whole things comes back really to what we believe is true about ourselves.. Is our self-concept true or is it a figment of our imagination?.  Our judgments, and therefore how we 'see' anything, arises from that.  Like the Paul Simon said, '...we see what we want to see and disregard the rest'<p>So how do we see what is true?<p>This is tricky because the mind that asks the question is the same mind that has created the self-concept.... and so it can never reason it's way beyond itself.  We invest a lifetime justifying, aggrandising and clinging to the thing we call 'me' and so seeing ourselves as we really are in not going to happen using the old familiar tools.<p>It seems to me that to know the simplest of truths requires an openness that few of us are used to  -- no thinking, no talking, no reasoning, no calculation, no busyness, no effort of any kind. Simply holding in mind what it is we needs to know and leaving an open and welcome space to be able to hear.<p>Anne Morrow Lindbergh nails this for me: ""The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy, or too impatient..... Patience and faith. One should lie empty, open, choiceless as a beach – waiting for a gift from the sea.""<p>Can you see now why approach is particularly troublesome for hackers?  We have brought up to be value knowledge, reasoning skills and discourse... and ashamed of ignorance.  Yet it is ignorance that is called for!<p>So what to do?<p>Not the place to attempt that one here  (perhaps a blog post) but it seems that our own path through life is itself this process of becoming willing to let go of our clinging to our pre-conceptions  -- of answering the fundamental question 'Who am I without my judgements'.  Life will always find some way to pry our hands away from clinging, even if our clinging is to the need to no longer cling.",1241276294

589869,comment,587271,587396,0,0,Adam503,,,"Nonsense. Let me introduce you to the town I was born in. Richland WA.<p>""...A huge volume of water from the Columbia River was required to dissipate the heat produced by Hanford's nuclear reactors. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived isotopes were not affected by this retention, and several terabecquerels entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000 curies (1,900 TBq) of radioactive material into the Columbia.[46] These releases were kept secret by the federal government.[4] Radiation was later measured downstream as far west as the Washington and Oregon coasts.[47]<p>The plutonium separation process also resulted in the release of radioactive isotopes into the air, which were carried by the wind throughout southeastern Washington and into parts of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and British Columbia.[4] Downwinders were exposed to radionuclides, particularly iodine-131, with the heaviest releases during the period from 1945 to 1951. These radionuclides filtered into the food chain via contaminated fields where dairy cows grazed; hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed the radioactive food and drank the milk. Most of these airborne releases were a part of Hanford's routine operations, while a few of the larger releases occurred in isolated incidents. In 1949, an intentional release known as the ""Green Run"" released 8,000 curies of iodine-131 over two days.[48] Another source of contaminated food came from Columbia River fish, an impact felt disproportionately by Native American communities who depended on the river for their customary diets....While major releases of radioactive material ended with the reactor shutdown in the 1970s, parts of the Hanford Site remain heavily contaminated. Many of the most dangerous wastes are contained, but there are concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River. There are also continued concerns about workers' health and safety.[53]<p>The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the 53 million U.S. gallons (204,000 m3) of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177 underground tanks. About a third of these tanks have leaked waste into the soil and groundwater.[54] As of 2008[update], most of the liquid waste has been transferred to more secure double-shelled tanks; however, 2.8 million U.S. gallons (10,600 m3) of liquid waste, together with 27 million U.S. gallons (100,000 m3) of salt cake and sludge, remains in the single-shelled tanks.[5] That waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018. The revised deadline is 2040.[53] Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270 billion U.S. gallons (1 billion m3) of contaminated groundwater as a result of the leaks.[55] As of 2008[update], 1 million U.S. gallons (4,000 m3) of highly radioactive waste is traveling through the groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.[5] The site also includes 25 million cubic feet (710,000 m3) of solid radioactive waste....""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site</a><p>The only part of nuclear power that is ""solved"" is the part where politicians figured out there is less uproar if they classify accidents as state secrets until decades have passed and and the victims are dying of weird cancers.",1241275280

For one, communicating your needs to a professional is also pretty costly, especially so when the task at hand also needs specialized knowledge from your own field (be it that communicating the requirements is a lot of work upfront or that the project in the first (few) round(s) doesn&#x27;t end up doing what you expected it to do - not exactly unheard of in the software world), and secondly, even if the problem that you need to solve is too difficult for you to solve with your basic knowledge, that basic knowledge might still be very helpful in communicating the problem to the professional, as you might be able to see what kind of information the professional needs in order to help you. Plus, it might allow you to better select a good professional - the risk of hiring someone who isn&#x27;t actually all that much of a professional is pretty real, after all, so adding to the costs of not learning and doing it yourself.",1400983103
7795160,comment,7793837,7794951,1,0,DSMan195276,,,"I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s the wrong interpretation. Function-calls <i>absolutely</i> require pushing a stack-frame, and TCO is no exception. TCO just says &quot;Oh hey, we&#x27;re done with the current stack-frame, let&#x27;s toss it out before we call the next function&quot;. That&#x27;s why TCO can apply to function-calls which aren&#x27;t recursive. The recursive case still follows this rule, it&#x27;s just the old and new stack-frames are identical. The compiler makes another optimization of not bothering to remove the stack-frame and just reuses it for the next call (Since it&#x27;s going to be the same size anyway). Even noting that, there are still some cases where this also doesn&#x27;t apply, because if (in C) you use VLA&#x27;s at the beginning which depend on a supplied argument, then even with TCO, you still have to remove and create a new stack-frame every call.",1400983093

We split every mailbox in to two sets of storage - SSD for messages less than 1 week old and lower than 1Mb in size, and big slower disk for the rest.  The index metadata is also on the SSDs, so most common usage patterns can be served entirely from SSD.<p>Those SSDs are a RAID1 pair of Intel DC3700 drives, which are enterprise drives and very fast even for SSDs.  We dropped a chunk of money on moving to this setup, and it&#x27;s made both IMAP and regular web usage very nice.<p>So basically, we&#x27;re optimised for IMAP and we&#x27;re optimised for speed.  Every server has local storage, and the local storage is fast.  It gives quite predictable performance, and very fast performance.<p>That&#x27;s my story as both the author/maintainer of our IMAP server, and the designer of the server architecture.<p>That&#x27;s not saying that GMail is awful, just IMAP isn&#x27;t so much their focus, and they don&#x27;t optimise for it.",1400982920

7795149,comment,7794346,7795089,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Having patents and enforcing them does not make you a troll. It&#x27;s generally understood that trolls are non-practicing entities.<p>Apple and Microsoft have managed to turn that line thoroughly into mud by weaponizing patent trolling as a tool to wage proxy wars.<p>> Unfortunately, people frequently use the word as a derogatory term for &quot;someone who uses patents in a way I don&#x27;t like&quot; (which often really means &quot;someone who uses patents for their intended purpose, which I don&#x27;t like on principle&quot;), making it lack any real meaning.<p>Patent trolling as a practice has quite clear contours: The perpetrator alleges patent infringement and demands a license fee which is less than the cost of proving non-infringement or patent invalidity in court, leaving the victim having to either pay the troll the Danegeld regardless of infringement or pay even more to their own lawyers to prove otherwise.<p>> That someone as litigious as Oracle was supporting this should tell you something: that this effort had little to do with &quot;reforming patents&quot; and more to do with &quot;large corporations managing risk&quot;.<p>Your explanation is belied by the number of patent nastygrams received by startups that can hardly be described as &quot;large corporations.&quot; That we see Oracle on the side of reform next to the likes of Red Hat and the EFF only goes to the severity of the problem.",1400982772

I&#x27;ve never once in this discussion stated, or even alluded to my political opinions, let alone tried to convince anyone else of them. I offered opinions about the politics of the editorial staff of both the Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal, neither of which should be terribly controversial, and both of which are utterly orthogonal to my beliefs; and I offered an opinion about whether Piketty wrote his book in service of a pre-existing <i>agenda</i>, as distinct from a <i>belief</i>. That, too, is irrelevant to my politics.<p>Second, my claim of <i>ad hominem</i> isn&#x27;t &quot;ironic&quot; in light of my other statements. Nowhere did I say the positions of the FT or WSJ editors were <i>wrong</i>; I said they were <i>biased</i>. One can be biased and correct, just as one can be biased and wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a stretch to posit that the author of your WSJ quote meant it to convey something about how correct Piketty could possibly be, because &quot;socialist&quot;. Note, too, that the quote doesn&#x27;t say Piketty, himself, is a socialist; it just says that he keeps their company (or, more specifically, that they — but mostly, just this one, <i>really, really icky one</i> — keep his): guilt by association.<p>Contrarily, I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re wrong because anything; I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re wrong <i>at all</i>.

7795125,comment,7793837,7794369,2,0,russell_h,,,"The problem is that this forces programmers to tightly couple interfaces and implementations.<p>Take for example a cache interface that wraps multiple implementations. The cache might be in-process or it might be a centralized memcached, etc. In order to support both of these, the &quot;get&quot; method must take a key and a callback. But the most reasonable in-process implementation actually grows the stack before calling the callback, while the other implementations reset it. If you iterate a large list of keys, you&#x27;ll blow the stack with the in-process implementation.<p>So you end up doing things like &quot;setImmediate()&quot; on every get to reset the stack. The &quot;async&quot; library has a neat trick to detect if the callback is called without deferring to the event loop, in which case it does the deferral itself. But in general, programmers are forced to think about these kinds of problems constantly, or hit weird bugs. For example, I once had a periodic task that iterated every account in the database.

Yes tail calls are gotos, but it is at an order of magnitude better than a goto at conveying the meaning of the code snippet to a human.<p>This is anecdotal, but some reasons, goto labels are not as well named as function names. With a goto it is more difficult to guess what data the destination code is expected to touch.<p>Tail calls are an improvement on both the counts. I often do not have to break context from reading a piece of code to start reading the piece of code that the program counter jumps to (unless it is a very local jump). The arguments passed by a tail call and the name of the function that has been tail called often makes (i) breaking code reading context less necessary and (ii) make larger semantic jumps remain within realms of easy human reasoning. With gotos, the jumps better be within 20 lines of text.",1400980976

7795036,comment,7793134,7793334,1,0,B-Con,,,"Fundamentally, the problem is the community. If you don&#x27;t attract people who make good comments and you don&#x27;t have a high enough ratio, you won&#x27;t have a good system no matter what you do. And I think newspapers have a couple problems there:<p>* Good communities on the Internet generally are focused on a specific topic. That encourages people who like the field to show up and gives most participants something in common. They have similar base knowledge, similar interests, and the community <i>has a goal</i>. Sub-reddits are usually fairly focused, HN is actually a little broad, but still has a relatively narrow field of interest. A newspaper likely won&#x27;t have that.<p>* Good communities are the result of &quot;trying again&quot;. When a community goes bad, the better contributers leave and join new ones. The old ones generally die, either literally or they just go down the tubes in quality of content. The good communities you see are to some extent the result of many failed communities. But newspapers are fixed, they can&#x27;t just die off and try again.<p>* Good communities have moderators who drop the ax on allowed content. This isn&#x27;t a long-term solution, but I think it&#x27;s necessary to have this until the community is primed and trained to vote wisely themselves. From my experience, starting a community with a core baseline of values is like herding cats. Someone in charge has to be firm and &quot;unfair&quot; for a while to get things started in the right direction. Would newspapers actually heavily censor their comments?<p>None are strict requirements, but I think they are very helpful in creating a good community.<p>For example, some sub-reddits have nearly died in terms of quality only to resurrect themselves back into something semi-worthwhile. (Only examples I can pull directly from memory are /r/pics and /r/technology, neither of which is a great subreddit now, but goodness gracious you should&#x27;ve seen them two or three years ago.) But in those cases, they had the advantage of the things you listed, like reddit&#x27;s hell-banning, karma, and ruthless moderators who made unpopular authoritarian decisions until the voters were trained to do a good job themselves.",1400979605

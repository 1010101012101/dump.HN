Originally i would still often go directly to google for better results, but each year the amount of times I&#x27;d do that decreased. Now I&#x27;m actually really happy with DDG results, and when I do perform the same search on Google, it ends up being less accurate. I think this is because Google has such a huge belief that personalization yields accuracy, but it doesn&#x27;t. Past trends don&#x27;t always predict future patterns. Google gimped their search engine in my totally honest opinion. It&#x27;s completely useless until I filter for &quot;Verbatim Search&quot;, because they keep guessing at synonyms for my search terms and randomly leaving out terms their algorithm thinks aren&#x27;t important to me.

So, I won&#x27;t retell the whole thing. The short version is it was a DUI trial for a guy having a party in his front yard and playing music (too) loudly from his truck. That is, he wasn&#x27;t driving or planning to drive, but he was intoxicated with his keys in the ignition of an automobile – technically a DUI. I ended up being the sole not guilty vote. Technically, he broke the law, but I wasn&#x27;t going to give the guy a DUI for that behavior – possibly a felony, probably lose/suspend his license, possibly lose a job, etc. Anyway, it was really hard to be the lone dissenter when everybody else just wants to be done and go home to their families or whatever.<p>I just wanted to comment that most people seem to be totally unaware of jury nullification, and you need to be careful explicitly mentioning the idea.

Typographic detail might also suggest other opportunities: for example, spaces between items in a list might be made wider than those of sub expressions within each item.<p>In my work I started by laying out the results I wanted in TeX, giving tons of power over small typographical details, and it paid off.

I find that assortative mating may have meaningfully contributed to the rise. I develop a general model of genes and assortative mating which shows that small changes in sorting could have large impacts on the extremes of genetic distributions. I apply my theory to autism, which I model as the extreme right tail of a genetic formal thinking ability distribution (systemizing). Using large sample data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I find strong support for theories that autism is connected to systemizing. My mating model shows that increases in the returns to systemizing, particularly for women, can contribute significantly to rising autism rates.  I provide evidence that mating on systemizing has actually shifted, and conclude with a rough calculation suggesting that despite the increase in autism, increased sorting on systemizing has been socially beneficial.<p>[...]<p>if you marry your high school sweetheart, you picked among those people who happened to be born in your town, but if you marry your college sweetheart, you have picked among people who chose the same college that you did. More recently, the internet has made it easier to find people with similar interests or traits<p>[...]<p>one less understood impact of assortative mating is the strong effect it has on the extremes of distributions. Positive assortative mating on a trait increases the variance of that trait, and the increase in variance causes large relative growth at the extremes of the distribution.<p>[...]<p>the growing returns to mathematical ability may have contributed significantly to the increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders.  Diagnosed rates of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have grown tremendously over the last few decades, and a number of possible explanations have emerged. One of the more interesting possibilities is that ASDs are related to a genetic trait called systemizing, which governs how much our brains are wired for thinking about formal systems. High levels of systemizing may give ability in pursuits like mathematics and computer languages.<p>&quot;",1449236378

Planning has gone from the simple but noble goals of ensuring public safety and efficient flow of goods and services to dictating lifestyle and trying to preserve things exactly as they are.<p>The typical suburb or sprawling city, for instance, doesn&#x27;t merely not take into account public transit in zoning and approval processes, it actively allows <i>only</i> sprawling designs. Minimum setbacks, floor area ratio limits, side, front, and back yard requirements, minimum parking requirements, and height limits all act to make it so nothing but sprawl is even <i>legally possible</i>.<p>I can point to numerous examples of these sorts of regulation from all over the United States in cities big and small, from New York to Nome. Yes, this includes places like Houston where it is claimed that there is no zoning but land use control is still Stalnist.<p>This is all based on a 1950s utopian vision where all people everywhere would have cars, cars would just be extensions of people, and we&#x27;d all be able to live in a comfortable middle class suburb the next state over because modern planning would ensure no traffic could ever happen.<p>It would also ensure those pesky apartments full of those &#x27;others&#x27; would have limited density, so they&#x27;d be packed away in some ungodly corner of the world where everyone else wouldn&#x27;t have to see them.<p>This power is still used today as a de facto tool of modern segregationists who are concerned not merely with race, but also class and even taste and lifestyle.<p>Reducing the power of these local regulators so that urban planning once again becomes a boring profession concerned with public safety and the movement of people, goods, and services and not a way to enforce a very specific 1950s utopian lifestyle would go a huge way to fixing sprawl in America.<p>>You can&#x27;t have people out waiting on public transport in that mess.<p>Until about the 1950s, people in the South did wait on public transportation. Look up the timetables and maps of the old railroads, interurbans, and streetcars. You&#x27;d be amazed how far reaching public transportation in the US was. Many of the cities of consequence in the South sprung up around the railroads.<p>Atlanta, for instance, used to be known as &#x27;Terminus&#x27; as it was the end of the line for a railroad with nothing else nearby. The city was built around it, grew rapidly, and eventually the state capital was moved there. Streetcars further fueled growth.

The shooter in the Port Arthur massacre cited the school shooting in Dunblane, Scotland, as an inspiration for his crime. That happened the month before Port Arthur, and was heavily publicized in the month leading up to the Port Arthur shooting. The harm is that, by the admission of a mass shooter, the publicity surrounding another mass shooting inspired him to commit another one.<p>Ah, but it IS about the tools they use. That was my whole point regarding Australia&#x27;s ban on automatic and semiautomatic rifles following Port Arthur. The ban on these types of weapons has correlated to a dramatic decline in mass shootings, because ready access to those types of weapons allows you to shoot lots of people at a high rate of speed. The after incident report of the Port Arthur shooting showed that the perpetrator killed almost a dozen people - a third of the death toll of the entire incident - within the first thirty seconds of the attack. Why? Because the shooter had a very accurate, high-rate-of-fire weapon carrying thirty or more rounds in a highly enclosed space. (Most of the people he shot were less than fifteen feet away.)<p>Now, would the incident have had the same death toll if the perp only had access to, say, a handgun? Possibly, but I doubt it. I know from my own experience with firearms that a rifle is substantially more accurate and holds way more ammo.<p>Australia&#x27;s ban and reaction to this incident makes perfect sense to me, and two decades of empirical evidence seem to suggest their policy choice was absolutely the right one.",1449235437

The Makani equipment might need 50% more space, but probably not 500% or 5000% more which would really make it unattractive.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine#Wind_turbine_spacing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine#Wind_turbine_spac...</a><p>If Makani a 50% lower capital cost then you&#x27;ll probably see regular turbines continue to be sited where their higher capital cost is effective and Makani equipment deployed where the traditional turbines are uneconomic.",1449235186

For example, author of Learn You Some Erlang writes [1]:<p>> if you can avoid the whole procedure (which will be called relup from now on) and do simple rolling upgrades by restarting VMs and booting new applications, I would recommend you do so.<p>Erlang grew out of the challenges faced by telecoms industries such as what do you do when blue-green isn&#x27;t an option? Think an in-use packet switch that is the only point of contact between two networks. No way to take the switch down for maintenance without <i>some</i> interruption in service, which gets messy when dealing with timeouts. In the Armstrong thesis paper he gives another example [2]:<p>> Usually in a sequential system, if we wish to change the code, we stop the system, change the code and re-start the program. In certain real-time control systems, we might never be able to turn off the system in order to change the code and so these systems have to be designed so that the code can be changed without stopping the system. An example of such a system is the X2000 satellite control system developed by NASA.<p>This power comes at a cost, though. LYSE again:<p>> It is said that divisions of Ericsson that do use relups spend as much time testing them as they do testing their applications themselves. They are a tool to be used when working with products that can imperatively never be shut down.<p>The point being, hot code reloading is an additional feature that can come in handy but for most of HN&#x27;s audience probably won&#x27;t be relevant; the cost outweighs the benefits of just blue-green deploying it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/relups#the-hiccups-of-appups-and-relups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/relups#the-hiccups-of-appups-a...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf</a>",1449234064

And even longer ago, all conversations required meeting, and were private unless an eavesdropper was physically nearby.<p>Tech has created more extreme possibilities on both sides.

On the surveillance side, it&#x27;s possible to eavesdrop on nearly everyone (except the very sophisticated).<p>We can&#x27;t and (don&#x27;t want to) go back in time.

We quickly found for the plaintiff against the main defendant. There were a slew of co-defendants, who aside from the reading of the charges had not been mentioned at all during the trial. No evidence, no description of their supposed involvement, nada. The foreman started to copy our verdict onto the forms for them as well. I objected, pointing out that we had only discussed the one defendant and needed to consider the others separately. Much protesting and eye-rolling ensued, but the urge to leave won out and the jury agreed to find all of the co-defendants not guilty. I was pleased with the outcome but appalled by the process. I would hate to be judged so carelessly by my peers. Yes, having 12 jurors does increase the odds of having someone put on the brakes and insist on proper procedure, but it is by no means guaranteed.",1449234044

At first I was horrified (it was ancient, user hostile, completely inflexible) but I actually saw that it worked - the companies being acquired were all in the same industry and their core processes were all pretty much identical (even if the terminology was all different) - so they could all adapt to the new application and it actually ended up working pretty well.<p>More &quot;modern&quot; flexible applications ended up having multi-month/multi-year &quot;implementation&quot; phases as teams tried to change their new application to their existing processes when it was actually easier to standardise the processes around a fixed application.",1449234039

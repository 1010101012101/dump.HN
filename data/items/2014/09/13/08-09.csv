I wake up without an alarm clock, I feel refreshed and ready to start the day. I perform better during the day, and I usually don&#x27;t feel tired again until it&#x27;s bed time.<p>Now, of course there are lots of occasions where this sleep pattern is simply not possible, but no matter how long the disruption lasts, it always feels grindy and awkward. Then I definitely need an alarm clock, I tend to sleep more overall, and I often feel purged about halfway through the day. Nobody can tell me this is what being healthy is supposed to feel like.<p>Of course a lot of people feel fine rising early, but the obvious mistake here is to derive from it that everybody must do the same.

It represents all the colors (chromaticities) that humans can see.  A device that reproduces images using primary colors can reproduce all the colors within the vertices of the primaries used.  For example, an RGB monitor can reproduce all colors within the triangle formed by the particular R, G, and B subpixel primaries as plotted on that diagram.<p>What you&#x27;ll notice though is that because the diagram has a curved edge (this is the spectrum of visible light actually), no polygon can encompass all colors.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought it would be cool if someone made a CRT using two prisms (splitting light from a blackbody), such that a narrowband of light from one prism is combined with a narrowband of light from the other prism in different intensities.

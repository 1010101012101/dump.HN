But that's not new. While democracy is great at preventing certain abuses of power which clearly hurt the populace at large. Hence, it is also good at preventing violent uprising. So while it comes up with good solutions to some problems, the democratic process we have doesn't come up with the right solution to <i>every</i> problem, terrorism being a good example. This notion is much older than JFK, of course. One purpose of the Bill of Rights was explicitly anti-democratic: put in a general way, it prohibits the majority from oppressing inherent rights of minorities.<p>In theory, it is the role of the courts to strike down such laws as unconstitutional. In practice, this doesn't seem to happen very quickly, Japanese internment serving as one historical comparison [2]. But the sky has not fallen, former transgressions were greater, and like them, this too, shall pass.<p>What <i>is</i> novel about the current political climate in the US, as far as I can tell, is the extent of the influence money has in politics, and the magnitude of such money being spent. The best chronicle of this I've read is ""So Much Damned Money"" [3]. <i>This</i> is a problem worth fretting over.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307266540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307266540</a>",1267231916

Could he franchise out his business to run on different corners of town and take a percentage of the revenue? Maybe.<p>We'll see how creative he gets. Maybe me sending him this is a way for him to realize that having ideas is like having seeds and having money is like having water to help grow that seed. If he wants to.

If you have more than 8 people, I'll need a helper.<p>* I've produced some pretty tasty food in some pretty dire kitchens in my life but if your kitchen comes equipped with at least the basics, it's going to be much easier for me to produce something amazing.<p>* If you're interested in cooking, feel free to help in the kitchen and I might be able to teach you a couple of things. If you have no interest, that's fine too.<p>* I'm an inveterate meat lover but I can also do very tasty vegetarian food.<p>If this is something you're interested in, shoot me an email at hang@bumblebeelabs.com and tell me a little bit about yourself and we'll see if we can get it done.<p>Thanks HN!<p>*For my 21st birthday, I cooked 21 courses of food over 21 hours for 21 people.

If you're going to do that, you should have a good reason beyond ""it's easy"" and ""you can have music""<p>Flash is most successful when it's used properly: for small regions of video or cool interactivity.

How did forcing ""loans"" on Wells Fargo and other banks that didn't need money save us from anything?</i><p>Part of the force in economics is psychology. If enough people think the dollar will crash then it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I don't know if you were paying attention when, after Congress first rejected TARP, the stock market shot down severely again. There are many people out there that believe the dollar will crash - something Ron Paul has warned for a long time, long before our current economic crisis (a big reason for his sudden popularity). Many people still believe it's not a question of if but when. The scary thing is just how much everything flipped upside down, and Dr. Paul went from ""kook"" to genius, while at the same time Warren Buffet tells us he also noticed the shift, while attending a birthday party of well-to-do friends, where many started asking if their money-market investments were safe: ""When people who drive Rolls-Royces are worrying about their piggy banks, you know you've got a problem"" - Warren Buffet (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126056572135687829.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126056572135687829.html</a>)",1267229358

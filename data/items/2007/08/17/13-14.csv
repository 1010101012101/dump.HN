It's worth noting that one of them (Intense Debate) is identical in almost every regard to a YC company (Disqus).  I dunno who was first, but they are both apparently in a somewhat closed beta with a few real users.  Both look good, and it's a product I would use (and I believe we will be using Disqus on a new blog).  May the best business win, I reckon.<p>As a few other commentators have noted about Tech Stars (including one of the TS advisors), these are mostly features, and not products.  That's OK, of course, as long as they realize they are features looking for a home rather than businesses waiting to be built.<p>YC also has quite a few feature companies, but it's possible to think of ways most could become products without a lot of stretching of the brain or dramatic changes in direction of their development.  I am, of course, speaking without having heard the pitch from the Tech Stars groups.  Maybe they are like YC company Fuzzwich, which I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to build a business on it until I heard the presentation (while dosed appropriately with the YC Kool-Aid, of course).  It's still a really long shot, but they'll have a lot of fun, and with luck and good biz dev they might pull off something amazing.<p>Best of luck to the Tech Stars companies.",1187358902

If they shift the app to include advertising to achieve that level of revenue, it's going to lose out to whatever copy cat is still ad-free.",1187357953

If you think about it one day people will laugh about the Ipod. I never really grasp the concept of putting all your songs in a box. It is like carrying all your savings in a briefcase rather than a debit card. Anywhere will soon ( i hope) start streaming your tunes using edge, gprs or wifi enabled phones. wacth out Jobs.",1187357448

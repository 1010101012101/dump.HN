Actually, my exact comment was about to be, ""This isn't hacker news no matter how you look at it, but it's pretty interesting nonetheless.""<p>Somehow we'll need to find a balance between what is interesting but isn't hacker news - sometimes, non-hacker news is interesting enough to deserve a place here, although most of the time it isn't. Or maybe we can just say, for the sake of safety, that anything non-hacker related is inappropriate? Not sure about that.",1214081831

223841,comment,223654,223831,0,0,BrandonM,,,"<i>WTF? Why doesn't the new repr(1L) return ""1L""? I thought the whole point of the repr custom was to output something that would regenerate the same object.</i><p>Because there's no such thing as 1L anymore. There is one unified (unbounded) integer, and I believe the C implementation will use int to represent small values and long when necessary (and list of long beyond that?).<p><i>Are they going to abandon the 'Format %d:%s"" % (n, s)' or just add PEP 3101? The % syntax is down-and-dirty practical good. PEP 3101 is neat, but printf() syntax is tough to beat.</i><p>I'm a little worried about this as well. I just wrote a ctemplate module that leverages % syntax a lot, so it would be quite unfortunate to see it disappear.<p>In other words, you could write code like:<p><pre><code>  char * months[%(len(pyvar_months))d];\n</code></pre>\nMy module uses string interpolation on this file, but it defines a special class with a __getitem__ method that instead of simply returning the associated string (as a dict would), it evaluates an arbitrary Python expression. And it works! It's pretty cool to be able to mix C and Python in this way to more easily write C code.<p>That may seem minor, but I've used the same framework to be able to say:<p><pre><code>  %(array; char *; months; ['""%s""' % (mo,) for mo in pyvar_months])s\n</code></pre>\nAssuming that pyvar_months is<p><pre><code>  [""January"", ""February"", ""March"", ..., ""December""]\n</code></pre>\n(in Python), the automatically-generated C result will be:<p><pre><code>  /* header file */\n  extern char * months[12];\n\n\n  /* C file */\n  char * months[12] = {\n      ""January"",\n      ""February"",\n      ""March"",\n      ...,\n      ""December""\n  };\n</code></pre>\nOkay, sorry to go so off topic, but I really wanted to show that it's possible to use the current string interpolation functionality to do really cool stuff, and it would be a shame to see that change.",1214080662

223836,comment,223708,223708,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Hosting reselling is an old form of marketing. Welcome to the Internet!<p>As for is it worthwhile? Well, how many friends do you know? If you have a big social network and can convince them then yeah, you can make some money off of it. A buddy of mine started reselling hosting packages from a tier 2 service provider and slowly graduated into buying his own racks and providing better products. It's enough to get him a house and a comfortable living but it also took him 5 years of hustling and bustling and a friends and moderators of a tech-oriented web forum to continuously market for him.<p>If you scour the forums, it's typical that you'll find ads for them as well. And as for the guy that said you'll be fielding the tech questions: that's really true. Some service providers will be doing that for you, it depends on who you pick to partner with.<p>Should you get into it? Only if you do a bit more research than just pitching a question on Hacker News.<p>Suggestions on where to start:<p><a href=""http://www.webhostingsearch.com/reseller-web-hosting.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webhostingsearch.com/reseller-web-hosting.php</a><p><a href=""http://www.devshed.com/reseller-web-hosting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.devshed.com/reseller-web-hosting</a><p><a href=""http://www.thehostingnews.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehostingnews.com/</a>",1214080094

That being said I've seen plenty of hosts thrive in the reseller market.<p>One suggestion is don't compete on price. You'll never win. Find something else like quality or customer service.<p>I personally use a reseller account because I like not having  to worry about server security.

223832,comment,223708,223708,0,0,stoic,,,"It can be worthwhile, but there are a couple of different types of hosting resale that you could consider, apart from web hosting. It may be more economical for you to rent a low-end dedicated server (Celeron etc) and a control panel license, and then resell service from there. However, Hostgator might provide an all-in-one solution for you to use (billing, automatic setup, etc), which may simplify the process.<p>I personally won't allow any money to ride on a machine to which I do not have root. :)",1214079651

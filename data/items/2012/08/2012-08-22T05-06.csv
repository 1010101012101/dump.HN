4416229,comment,4416034,4416187,4,0,dangrossman,,,"There's a wildly successful and profitable business model for getting money for TV content. It's cable and satellite subscriptions. More than half of all households in the US pay for a cable subscription.<p>Everyone (in the US) gets TV content from the major networks for free -- just connect an antenna to your TV. You can pay to get more content, and access to previous seasons, by subscribing to cable or satellite. Subscribing doesn't reduce the ads at all, just gets you more things to watch.<p>Hulu is an exact replica of the business model, except using the web instead of radio and cable lines, as the delivery method.<p>Everyone (in the US) gets TV content from Hulu for free -- just browse to their website. You can pay to get more content, and access to previous seasons, by subscribing to Hulu Plus. Subscribing to Hulu Plus doesn't reduce the ads at all, just gets you more things to watch.<p>The only difference is that a cable subscription averages more than 10 times the monthly cost of Hulu Plus. To expect to not only pay 90% less than cable, but also eliminate the advertising, is unrealistic.",1345615098

4416225,comment,4414728,4415387,1,0,FrojoS,,,"Right. Or just use org-mode. As an example I switched from Textmate to Emacs about a month ago because of org-mode. It is an absolute killer app! Before that, I was merely using Emacs to write commit messages or make small changes. Now it is taking more screenSpace*time per day than the browser :-)<p>If you are on the Mac, I [1] can recommend using Aquamacs [1] in the beginning. It supports shortcuts like Cmd-z, Cmd-c or Cmd-v in addition to the Emacs shortcuts. It does not allow for marking text with Shift-<arrow key> and does not support Emacs 24 yet, but org-mode is already pre-installed and will work like a charme. Just create a new file with the ending .org, open it in Emacs and you are already in org-mode!<p>[1] Carsten Dominic, the creator of org-mode recommends it, too!

I honestly don't remember how I got started programming - some people rhapsodize about that first moments coding, but for me it was mostly rage at a capricious Java compiler that I felt was always either finding a creative way to do something other than when it should or throwing an error completely unrelated to what was wrong.<p>After I got past that point everything was gravy. I've always been kind of confused by the learning curve metaphor (If the learning curve is steep, doesn't that mean you learn faster? What's the x and what's the y in this?) but tech now is getting closer to the ideal linear curve, where additional learning and productivity are at a relatively constant proportion no matter what stage you're at rather than being a floor function until you hit a certain level.<p>Which is awesome.",1345614799

4416203,comment,4416143,4416143,3,0,droithomme,,,"No bitterness, but intense frustration when usability takes a hit. Based on experience, the bigger preview images and the gee whiz animation will be found to be appreciated among test subjects and the redesign thus proclaimed a success. But the new difficulties in finding shows to watch, and to comment on and thus engage with, will result in fewer views as time goes by.<p>Animated transitions, slow alpha fade ins for menus and popovers, and huge fonts are the latest design fad and is a must have for 2012 sites. If it makes actual usability worse, it doesn't matter.<p>This evening I went there, saw a clip for The Office. This caused be to wonder if it had started or was about to start, so I went to the show page. No longer are there air dates shown. The clip I saw that was featured it wasn't clear if it was a preview from the next season or something from the past (I didn't remember seeing it). Went to find the episode list and found it doesn't exist anymore. Went to find discussion to see if others were talking about when the shows start and comments were empty. Couldn't accomplish anything I wanted to. I'm going to say that's a usability failure, at least compared to last year's design. There's a lot of room for improvement on Hulu so a redesign is not unwelcome. It's always been challenging to find what recently broadcast TV shows are available, one has to click on multiple next/prev tabs on multiple layers of sliding shows. But rather than add a list that shows a lot in a compact space, they removed the list from other areas and copied the difficult parts of their site onto the parts that were actually working.<p>Not all the changes in the last few months are bad. The hover text on the play controls are nice, explaining that clicking the volume icon does mute, and that the round arrow means 10 second rewind. But overall the new design has many things that are a step backward.",1345614159

Content is king here, and Hulu just doesn't have it.<p>As a viewer, I expect a site like this has to either be niche, or truly all encompassing. I think things like Stargate or Highlander could support their own sites. Comedy Central was smart to do their stuff (South Park, Daily Show, Colbert) by show. CBS even does Star Trek on StarTrek.com. Hulu seems to try to do everything, but fails.

4416189,comment,4413713,4413713,3,0,polshaw,,,"I love the idea. It's really great to see something innovative here. I was almost going to say a little bit of genius, but i have a few more reservations now i have thought the idea over-- mainly that i don't think i'd see value in the 'game' (that is, saving potential) unless i really liked all the tees on offer. So that sets the proposition to me[1] as very close to any other online t-shirt retailer (would anyone suspect their favourite was going to be least liked?).<p>BUT in the very worst case scenario, you have a fantastic marketing gimmick to drive people to the site, and keep many of them coming back perhaps. I really wish there was a 'control' to compare this to, to see what effect this has on sales- it seems it will be hard to know how much the game is driving sales vs people just liking the tees. My current feeling is the idea might function better slightly tweaked.. eg. offer the shirts at $18 normally, or $20 with the freebie game.. only count the $20 sales toward the totals.. might offer some balance-- for example, the 'better' (popular) one won't currently have a lot of appeal WRT. the game, because most will rightly assume it wouldn't be least popular. Add the tweak and there is an element of double-guessing that might make more people believe they have a chance of 'winning'? Hope that made sense.. it's not a fully worked out idea, but worth thinking about perhaps.<p>Also, consider following OKcupid and having an onsite blog.<p>[1] perhaps not everyone is like me (or us here), though",1345613721

I have found that it's a field where knowledge of parallel programming is incredibly valuable but few people end up putting the effort in to make their code take advantage of the hardware. People who are interested in parallel programming are a rare asset to have.<p>At least within my company we haven't used much in the way of parallel programming languages like OpenCL/CUDA/Cilk, preferring instead to use a task based concurrency library not entirely unlike Intel's TBB, but more cross platform. There's more investigation into GPGPU happening these days -- I'm curious to see if it'll pan out for more than just rendering applications. I'm also curious to see if the other (physics/audio/animation) areas can pull GPU time away from the rendering guys :)<p>The trajectory in this field is predictable.

4416163,comment,4414375,4416068,3,0,charlieflowers,,,"OK, I appreciate your openness to understanding my point of view. I will articulate/respond respectfully.<p>First, some quick points:<p>1. I must apologize for misinterpreting ""Math Wars"". I though it was referring to the recent little ""skirmishes"" between certain math professors and Khan Academy (as found here, for example: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/khan-academy-readers-weigh-in/2012/08/02/gJQA83rW9W_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/khan-a...</a>)<p>2. Your tutorials sound fantastic. I haven't had the pleasure of working through them, but they certainly sound like they are raising the level of worldwide math education.<p>So, before I go any further, let me ask -- are you at all entangled with (or even on the periphery of) the skirmish referred to by the link I posted above, between Mathalicious founder Karim Kai Ani and Khan Academy? Or the skirmish triggered by some of Frank Noschese's criticisms, as in <a href=""http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/you-khant-ignore-how-students-learn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/you-khant-ignore-h...</a> ?<p>The reason I ask is because this is what I (perhaps mistakenly) though you were referring to, and it is many of these criticisms that I feel are baseless and petty.<p>If those criticisms really have nothing to do with your current post or even your current mental outlook, then all that's left for me to do is apologize for jumping to conclusions and getting overheated for something that has nothing to do with you.<p>If those criticism are relevant to your posting and current outlook, then perhaps it would make sense for me to continue onward by listing those criticisms that I feel are baseless. If so, I will proceed.",1345612842

But isn't the whole point of high level constructs that you can use and conceptualize them more easily than, and without prior understanding of, what happens at a lower-level? Just like you don't have to learn exactly how CPU registers work to learn C, you also don't have to learn all the principles of computer science behind 'each' before you can use it....<p>also - maybe you mean 'imperative' rather than 'iterative'?<p>In terms of 'abstract', I can see where you are coming from that there are more underlying principles and its more abstract from this point of view. From the point of view I was at, they are both referencing the same variables doing the same thing so its the same abstraction from a programmatic(?) point of view.

After a bust, arrested traffickers have been known to demand a receipt from authorities, so that they can prove the loss was not because of their own negligence (which would mean they might have to pay for it) or their own thievery (which would mean they might have to die).

They ran a contest: They would randomly select a half an hour time period (eg: 2.20 to 2.50pm). People who had shopped during that time on the previous day could come back with their time stamped receipts and get cash back.<p>The store tripled their number of customers per day.<p>This however worked because people didn't go out of their way to buy new things. They just went out of their way to buy the things they needed at a different store to get a chance to get cash back.<p>So my suggestion is this: source out the ""winning"" designs on threadless etc in the past 3 months. And list those t-shirts on your website only. Don't ask your audience to submit their designs.<p>And announce this fact. Re-assure people that they are buying the same ""hot"" stuff they would buy on other t-shirt sites.

It turned out, though, that my niche was poker, a game that conditions the people that play it to blow through money like there's no tomorrow. My niche was full of a) people who have a lot of discretionary income and aren't as attached to it as people generally should be and b) people who makes six figures (or more) per year off of group a.<p>Your niche is probably much poorer and much thriftier, and then much smaller on top of that. So you're going to have to get tremendous market share (pretty much all of it perhaps) to make real money.<p>The same is true with ads. I could get thousands per month running ads on my poker blog at a time when I hadn't posted on it in 6 months because anyone who clicks an ad is going to make the poker site $100 on average. My guess is you'd be lucky to make anything off someone who clicked an ad on your site.<p>I still think that most passion's are monetizable enough that you could make a real amount at them, but maybe not all are, and the difficulty in doing so and the maximum you can make varies widely.",1266965798

Consider just the additional travel required between:<p>(a) Each producer sells their goods to a central location (say, your local Walmart). Each consumer goes to the central location to purchase goods.<p>(b) Each consumer goes to each producer he/she needs goods from and purchases those goods directly.<p>(c) Each producer goes to a central location (e.g., a farmer's market) and directly sells his/her goods there to each consumer.<p>Scenario (a) is closer to current practice (it is missing many more levels of aggregation). You're proposing something like (b) or (c), as far as I can tell.<p>Hypothetically, assume you want to have milk, eggs, toast w/ jam, and apple for breakfast.<p>In (b), you wind up making several trips: one dairy farm, one chicken farm, one bakery, one orchard, and maybe one more for the jam. This multiplies by number of consumers. Also, farms are fairly distant from population centers, so this is a good deal of driving!<p>In (c), you only make one trip, but the problem winds up being on the other side. Each producer needs to drive all the way from the farm to each farmer's market and spend all day there. You wind up with number of producers times number of markets, and still a fair bit of driving (though nowhere near as bad as b!)<p>We haven't even considered the difference between growing produce in CA and shipping it in bulk vs. growing it in a heated greenhouse locally. Otherwise you're giving up a lot of wealth by having very limited selection during the cold months (or driving the CA to deal directly).<p>Nor have we considered other transaction costs of having to deal with many more vendors. For example, if you think of a checkout aisle, there are variable time sinks (vary basically linearly w/ number of items) and there are fixed time sinks (same for any number of items, e.g., credit card processing time). Those fixed time ones are going to be a problem.<p>Directly dealing with producers just doesn't scale.<p>It turns out that fuel and time is a actually pretty expensive, so every part of the supply chain is very efficient.",1266965400

1146690,story,,,3,3,discodancer,"Is my ego too big?",,"This thought came to me when I caught myself advocating non-mainstream technologies all the time. I was doing PHP in a company consisted entirely of .NET developers and was advocating Python - and I was only beginning to use Python for anything useful. After I changed my job to a more pleasant one, doing Python and Javascript in a company that has all kinds of developers (but again, mostly .NET/SQL Server) I found myself thinking about advocating Lisp (again, I am only beginning to grasp Lisp). That whole time i actively opposed using my work PC because it had Windows on it, and I was secretly, then in the open, using my Macbook. I was also advocating Mac OS X and Linux to people that clearly were never going to switch. At the moment of writing I'm in a dilemma whether I am deliberately putting myself in the position of an underdog in order to feed my ego. It's good to be the mad scientist. It's better to be not understood and dismissed because they know that behind all that weird talk there's something really special about you. Whether there is or not, it's not important; the real question (and fear of mine) is whether I'm doing this because Python and Lisp is really going to improve my work, or because I'm just feeding my ego. After all, you have to admit, those guys built a pretty big company using c++ and Microsoft MFC and it worked fine for them. Then again, most of the people I've met are of the ""I don't want to program after work"" type. Is it again egotistical to suppose that these people aren't good programmers? Is my ego to big or am I just inexperienced ?",1266965293

Most people aren't going to pay significantly more so it's not an appealing venture for private companies to make on their own except where competition exists and they have to offer more competitive packages in an effort to play defense. They're not doing it because offering a wideband connection brings in tons of new customers or more revenue from existing customers. It's purely a defensive move. There's also some question of how much bandwidth is enough. I move from a 10Mbit connection at home to a 100Mbit+ connection at work and I don't notice any difference. Sure files download quicker but we're talking 10 seconds versus 20 seconds in most cases. I can't really think of anything I can't do on a 10Mbit/sec connection. I'm also at a loss to figure out what room exists for innovation. Better quality streaming video? Sure I guess so but all things considered that's not my top concern.<p>So instead of focusing on raw speed maybe we should be focusing on reliability, pricing, latency, improved customer service, and a modest increase in speeds to get us all to this 10-15Mbit/sec range that is completely acceptable performance. Get people some choice so they at least have 2 or 3 providers and, over time, they will compete with each other as faster speeds are actually something customers need/want and not just a statistic that has almost no real meaning today.",1266965019

So much so that I wanted to test that and see whether this would be a reasonable way to segment reading material.<p>My recently launched site [1] is based on measuring and presenting the gender split of readers of any book (and how each sex rate the book) on the assumption that men and women often enjoy different reading material.  The data I've gathered so far seems to validate that assumption and points towards substantial gender bias for a great many books.<p>I'm currently in the process of writing a blog post highlighting the most frequently used words in book titles favoured by women vs. men based on the data I've collected.  This is my first dip into the ""MI"" of the data but, despite the simplicity of the initial analysis, again the data shows there is a pronounced difference.<p>What might be interesting is some sort of combination of the datasets.  Such as using an individuals reading history to categorise their ""average gender preference"" for books [2] and how might relate to their choice of dating partners and their book gender preference.<p>It's an interesting proposition and I like the clean look of the site and it's simple workflow.

What I mean is that if I invest in a platform, I expect the rules to stay roughly the same so I can hope to make a fairly predictable return on my investment.<p>If Apple creates a track record for itself of saying things like: Even though there are X,XXX companies developing porn apps (which we approved), we're going to stop allowing those arbitrarily, right now. Or what about: gee, we'd really like to get in on retail banking, so money related apps, those are out. Or how about, we want to partner with acme social media company, so any apps that interact with facebook, those are out.<p>My point is that they can do this once to the porn guys and just piss the porn guys off. If they do it again, to another group, that will and should scare the shit out of the entire developer population, because who's next?",1266962568

So by automatically testing the GUI you are basically just repeating yourself over and over.<p>Not to mention that when you want to improve the usability by rearranging things, it will be twice as hard to do if you need to change both the code and the tests.<p>Unless you have to render something pixel-perfect, it is probably not worth it to write automated tests. A human can look at your screens and verify that they aren't (or are) completely crap fairly quickly.<p>Ultimately humans will be the ones finding bugs in your software, and when they find UI layout bugs it should be immediately obvious by looking at the code what is wrong. If it isn't then you might need to separate UI from the rest of the gunk better.",1266962485

This commenter has an answer. It is, ""yes, those are meaningless metrics"".<p>1. The number of gem dependencies for Rails is an implementation detail, optimized for the benefit of people developing Rails extensions, and barely exposed to Rails developers. 80% of Rails developers couldn't tell you whether a method was defined in activesupport or activerecord, and those are two Rails dependencies that date back to the origin of Rails.<p>2. Since you don't have to edit any auto-generated file you're not interested in, the number of auto-generated files is irrelevant to you. Since the beginning, Rails has generated files that you're unlikely to care about; for instance, the only benefit I get from ""schema.rb"" is that I can make impressive printouts from it.<p>3. You can filter your stack traces, which is what you should do regardless of whether Rails tacks 10 lines to it or 100.<p>Has Rails jumped the shark? Maybe. I find myself reaching for Sinatra now instead of Rails, and I think the RESTful/Resourceful/multi-format idioms in modern Rails are overkill for most applications. But this article doesn't make a compelling argument about Rails.",1266962448

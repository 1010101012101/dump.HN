2786102,comment,2784515,2785645,2,0,kenjackson,,,"It's interesting in that in the supercomputing world the message passing model has been popular for decades, but not by choice.  It was the only way to get good performance.  But the holy grail has always been shared memory, not message passing.  But perf for shared memory applications has continued to be horrible.  But anyone who has experience writing a message passing and a shared memory version almost always concedes the shared memory version is easier.<p>Large scale parallel message passing apps are extremely difficult to get right.  Most people just haven't done it.  With that said, some of the difficulties in the past where tied to the fact that message passing was done with a weak type system, no contracts (I sent you message, but how do I know you're ever going to respond to it?), and weak support for gather/scatter.<p>AFAICT, not having done much at all with Erlang, it deals nicely with the type system issue, but contracts are still a problem.  Gather/scatter is partially assisted in the same way that PM/FM handled it in the past (you get to write code to pull messages out of your mailbox).<p>My prediction is that if message passing does take off in a big way, we'll see a pretty strong backlash to shared memory with functionality, such as type ownership and data representation synthesis.  Unfortunatley, most of this research is ignored in favor of the more popular functional work (which in itself is good, just not currently balanced in the language community by other types of thinking).",1311177194

I am aware of and on your side about the issues with patching the Object.prototype.<p>So, to be perfectly clear, the Object prototype will NEVER be modified in any way by default! The ""enableSugar"" method you have found (so resourcefully, I might add :) ) is something I added in later as an ""opt-in"" way of using objects as hashes in pages where you ALREADY have assurance that it won't break. It is intended as something of the reverse of ""noConflict"" in jQuery. By using this method you're basically saying that you're ready to live on the edge and will take responsibility for what breaks. More importantly you can turn it off again if something does start to break.<p>Now that having been said, even though I've added this method there is ZERO reference in it to the documentation. A few reasons for this: one is the backlash I knew I would get for even MENTIONING the sacred Object prototype (you may have proved that point, heh)... the other is that I'm not sure I ever really want it used... in the first place I sort of intended it as more of an ""easter-egg"" and I'm not sure I ever want to mention it in the docs...<p>In any case though it will NEVER be a default, and for precisely the reasons you've mentioned.",1311176036

2785887,comment,2784515,2785184,2,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"One of the easiest ways to create a parallel program is to split your data, or split your processing. When you split your data, you can just apply the same algorithm to both sets, and re-integrate the processed data. This necessitates that the processing can be done apart, however. Graphics cards already do this. They have many, many cores that are used for 3d graphics. You can easily split the work done on the screen into small chunks, process these individually, then put it back together. The other way is to have one core do one set of work, and another core do another set. The algorithms should process a similar amount of data though, otherwise you are wasting processing power.<p>The other problem is representation of data in the programming language. Objects, which are used in a lot of programming languages, can be hard to use when it comes to parallelism. An object can only be operated on by one algorithm at a time, and to achieve parallelism, you must use concurrency (locking). You can switch to a different paradigm away from OOP (object orientated programming), to something like FP (functional programming). Since everything is a function, with data just being passed around, you can abstract a program to multiple cores in a more natural way. FP comes with its own difficulties though. This isn't to say parallel programs can't be written in OOP programs successfully, it just requires a different mindset to normal programming.",1311174963

As a committed user of a great Mac text editor that, years ago, implemented its own version of almost all the document management features described so far, I can tell you that you get used to it very quickly. Spoiled by it, in fact. Ruined by it, some would say. Yes, it's a very different model from the one we're all used to. But it's also a better modelnot just for novices, but for geeks too.<p>This works fine with text editors (although I'd argue that if invoked via the equivalent of ""mvim"" or ""mate"" they should discard this), but it absolutely falls apart with media creation applications. Photoshop and Illustrator files can be <i>big</i>, and they can take a long time to open. Just so that you can close it immediately and open a different one. Logic Pro currently does this, and it isn't nice or better. It's <i>annoying</i>.<p>Then there's the privacy concerns. If a designer is working with multiple clients, the last thing he or she wants is a different client's work showing up when he or she is showing something to a client.",1311174451

I think it's pretty clear that Google+ is already a successful product that's making an impact, but let's pretend for a second that it isn't.<p>When Chrome launched, it had very little market share for a very long time. However, as it slowly grew, the obvious statement to make was that as other browsers saw it coming they quickened their pace and sped up their JavaScript engines, hastened release cycles, etc. Even if Chrome never did attain much market share (it did) it would have been seen by Google as a huge success very quickly: if all other browsers are faster that's still a win for Google.<p>So, even if Google+ never gets significant market share (too late, within weeks it has millions of users), it already has made an impact by providing intense competition for Facebook.<p>Google even launched video chats <i>before</i> Facebook did, showing very clearly that in some places (new features) they are already changing the landscape of social networking.<p>They already <i>have</i> made a significant impact.

We have very few engineering resources as the best hackers are already hard at work at their full time jobs and with funding we could be able to dedicate all of our attention to the project.<p>My opinion has always been that you need to prove that whatever you're doing is doable, confirm the hypothesis that someone would want to use it, before you go to people and ask for money. We might not have the luxury to be able to wait that long, but perhaps there's simply no other option and therefore it might take years before we can leave our full times :)<p>Something else I haven't found so far were examples of alpha demos that these now famous startups did back in the day. I've seen collections of demos for TechCrunch and other venues, where for example DropBox already had thousands of users and 10 developers on the team, but that's way past the stage I'm more interested in.

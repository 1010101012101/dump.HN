Are you really suggesting that a world that managed to build the Internet, where the mathematicians developed concepts like public key encryption and password hashing, where many banks routinely issue physical tokens for two-factor authentication before access to secure systems, and where several nations run national ID databases, we couldn't manage to devise a system where every user has unique credentials to access sensitive systems without those systems themselves being able to decrypt the user's data?<p>That's a load of nonsense. In the grand scheme of things, solving that problem is easy. We just haven't done it yet, because while Pandora's box is open, not enough people have yet come down with plague.<p>Sadly, that means things are going to have to get significantly worse before they get better.

Simply by being aware and choosing to work on something else -- GNU, Linux, your start-up, defeating DRM, anything open source -- you help swing the balance back in favor of everyone else.\n",1187473647

There are also 100s (if not 1000s) of great old books that most hackers would be interested in reading, but I don't think links should be submitted to them individually.  Perhaps a new aggregate list of links would be news since it is new.  Maybe a Hacker News wiki is a better place for such classics.  ",1187473240

43899,comment,43822,43891,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's true, but unfortunately the type of ""political awareness"" that arises out of social news sites seems to be guys sitting around on their computers and complaining about it.  That doesn't help anything; it just pisses off ordinary people who complain that ""these tech folks are so <i>negative</i>"".<p>IMHO, Google's got the right idea.  Become wealthy and powerful, and then you're in a position to lobby the government to change things.  Unfortunately many people just sit back and complain about what Google's doing too...",1187472904

43895,comment,43799,43837,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""while you're in grad school, your professors expect the best and brightest to go into academia, the less smart go off and work in industry""<p>I'm not sure that's unique to academia though.  I've met several financial types that expect the best and brightest to go into finance, and the less smart to go off to academia.  And several startup types that expect the best and brightest to go into startups, the less smart to go of off into finance or academia.  And several bums that expect the best and brightest to drop out of school and play World of Warcraft all day, while the less smart spend all their time slaving away for the man.<p>Everybody wants to feel like they made the right choice.  Hence, even if they didn't make the right choice, they assume that their choice requires superior intellectual ability.  You get a lot of self-justification.<p>Me, I <i>knew</i> I would suck at academia, so I went and joined a financial software startup.  Then I found I sucked at finance, so I'm founding my own startup.  Maybe I suck at startups too, but it's what I want to do.  If it totally fails I can become a bum and play WoW all day. ;-)",1187472362

It s light enough to carry around and the battery last a good few hours. But I find that when using my 47 inch screen monitor I just enjoy working more. I haven't measured output, but I believe It is slightly more than when I use my notebook. ",1187472075
43891,comment,43822,43843,0,0,portLAN,,,"Whether or not this is the appropriate forum for this particular post, it's high time that hackers became politically aware.  Existing power structures are set on criminalizing possession and usage of information in order to enforce artificial scarcity to maintain profits: Germany just passed a law declaring ""hacker tools"" illegal; the RIAA is now arguing that ""making files available"", even without copying, is infringement; there are provisions of the DMCA that make decrypting information you have legal access to <i>illegal</i> (DeCSS); Comcast is stopping BitTorrent transfers; patents threaten everyone; even your home Internet connection is severely throttled upstream to make you more of a consumer.  The list could go on and on (Skype and new Federal eavesdropping-on-citizens-without-warrants ""laws""; possible capital gains/income tax on virtual goods you've never sold; suing entire college student bodies at once in a fishing expedition for mp3 trading, etc., etc.)<p>There is an enormous amount of money to be made in the near term by plutocratic information restriction.  Unfortunately the severe clampdowns threaten to change the model from wealth <i>creation</i> to wealth <i>stagnation</i>, and everyone loses as money transfer moves closer to zero-sum.<p><i>""If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented and\nhad taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today. ... The solution is\npatenting as much as we can. A future startup with no patents of its own will be forced to pay\nwhatever price the giants choose to impose. That price might be high. Established companies have an\ninterest in excluding future competitors.""</i> -- Bill Gates\n",1187472065

43887,comment,42892,42906,0,0,bmaier,,,"Might be a bit late on the reply but the $10 cpm seems to be an inflated statistic.  The ones that are quoting that are getting rates of 10 per cpm on the canvas page while in reality that page is only a small fraction of the total page views.  If the canvas page accounts for 1/3 of total page views then that statistic gets brought down to a lower number cpm for total pageviews.  Is this consistent with what others are seeing?",1187471641

43884,comment,43847,43847,0,0,mhartl,,,"Subversion is a big improvement over CVS, but it still has some problems.  Perhaps the biggest is the difficulty of making branches, and keeping them in sync with the trunk (which requires keeping track of revision numbers <i>by hand</i> in the comments).  There have been many times I've wanted to make a branch but just couldn't summon the mental energy to do it.<p>I've found darcs to be a significant improvement over Subversion.  As one example, here's how to make a branch using darcs:<p>$ cp -r my_proj_trunk my_proj_branch<p>Then running<p>$ darcs pull ../my_proj_trunk<p>in my_proj_branch keeps you in sync with the trunk.",1187470886

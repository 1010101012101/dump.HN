788891,comment,787798,788754,0,0,jballanc,,,"<i>How long would they stay around for?</i><p>That depends on the thermodynamics. Specifically, it depends on the depth of the local minimum and the energy in the system. With some random chance, a protein can get out of a local minimum and fold into a different conformation. If nature is depending on the fold not changing, this could be a problem.<p><i>What sorts of problems? Would you need a lot of ""bad"" proteins to cause problems or just a few?</i><p>Again, it depends. In general, unfolded proteins are a bad thing. They are also a fairly common thing to find in cells, and cells have a specific ""unfolded protein response"" that kicks into gear if there are too many. Too many unfolded proteins literally ""gum up the works"".<p>For prions, tau (in Alzheimer's), and others, the story is a bit different. In these cases, the presence of even a few improperly folded proteins can catalyze further misfolding.<p><i>Alternatively, the proteins we find in nature might be more tractable than the general problem described in all its mathematical glory</i><p>This is almost certainly the case, but more tractable != not intractable. Solving the problem also requires clever solutions and a better understanding of physics. If your curious, I did my Ph.D. preliminary exam on one example (modern methods of handling side-chain entropy, including belief propagation techniques).

But checking if it's THE solution (i.e. the best solution) requires NP time.<p>In terms of traveling salesperson, what is ""a possible solution"" and what is ""the solution""?  I'm guessing ""the solution"" is the shortest path, but if ""a possible solution"" means some path through all the cities... then that doesn't help much.

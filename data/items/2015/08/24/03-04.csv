As a developer, you get a completely different service from Toptal than from other freelancing sites: as developers are vetted, so clients are selected to make sure you don&#x27;t end up working on unsubstantial projects or clients that cannot pay. You don&#x27;t have to pitch yourself to clients to get a job: when you have the qualifications for a gig, a dedicated recruiter will introduce you to the client, and follow through the interview process. Once you get a job, Toptal guarantees your payments against non-paying clients, on a NET20 term, and takes off of you all the hassle of the extra work you have to face as a freelancer, like contracts, NDAs, invoicing, getting paid.<p>There is a very well documented screening process, that requires surely a bit of your time to go through, just as any other application to any company you&#x27;d like to work with. In my career I&#x27;ve interviewed with several European and U.S. companies, and the more the company is cool, the more they will test you, Toptal does just the same. Three steps out of four of the process are live interviews. I took my testing in August 2013, it took less than a couple of weeks and in total I spent a couple of days&#x27; worth of my time. It&#x27;s definitely been worth it.<p>The algorithms I got tested on were of the same difficulty of the ones detailed in many books that prepare you for coding interviews, the same ones you&#x27;d go through if you were applying for Facebook or Google or other similar companies, nothing out of the ordinary in the tech world.<p>You can ultimately set your rate as you like, but recruiters will give you advice so that you can be in line with the market: I have about 20 years of professional experience and I live in Italy, my rate takes both those factors in consideration, and I am more than happy about it. If you have very niche skills, and as such ask for a high rate, Toptal will allow it, but then it will be harder for you to get hired. But you&#x27;re not doing the price war with unqualified developers that ask for $5/hour, that&#x27;s not how it works! Simply, if you have several patents and say your rate is $100/hour, and you want to apply for a 1 week Wordpress theme gig, it will not work out, but that&#x27;s just common sense.<p>After several months of working as a developer, I joined the recruiter team, and I can witness that Toptal developers are all qualified and smart: for as experienced as I may be, I am surely not the one with the most years. I have spoken with Toptalers that worked at Apple and then NEXT in the 80&#x27;s, researchers that work at CERN, creators of famous frameworks, that&#x27;s who you are competing with, especially if your rate is above the market average. It&#x27;s your call in the end.<p>All in all the experience is very personal, very human, the projects are great and, as long as you work well, are reasonable with your rate and have skills that are in demand, you will hardly be without work.",1440386542

The rise of the West German economy was much more to do with the liberalization of the economy, restriction on government and of course the personal economic, speech and actual freedoms of the West Germans.  By 1979 they were already exporting products to the USA and everywhere else by the container load.  &#x27;Mercedes Benz&#x27; by Janis Joplin was released in 1970 - the West German economy was in good shape by 1979, all from the work of the West German people.",1440385606

The restaurant includes a fixed percentage charge for the service on all items, announces it prominently, requites waiters to refuse any additional tips.<p>One can argue that, because the advertised prices would be, say, 18% higher, the restaurant would fail due to customers preferring restaurants with lower advertised prices.

There have been quite a few stories showing how admin in education is booming. Also, growth in numbers requires growth in facilities, which are a big money sink for most education institutions; you could argue a lot of this extra money is actually going to the building sector (and again, admin required for all these projects) as well as the constant churn that is IT upgrades.<p><i>> Grants and scholarships from the state have shrunk and shrunk and shrunk.<p>The more the State pumps into loans (driven by student numbers, and carrying a considerable management overhead), the less it has for direct subsidies.

A degree might help you get a job, but current trends mean that you might still end up being poor -- just a working one.<p>Rather than enforcing class status through education tiers, a progressive agenda should concentrate on restoring dignity to regular jobs.

Though patents do limit access to technology in many aspects; for instance, if the patent-holder decides not to sell their product in particular part of the world but ruthlessly pursues legal actions against people doing something similar there, then a population may not get to experience (and observe, and study) the technology. <i>Patents themselves</i>, as implemented within a system, actually limit access to knowledge - a patent text was supposed to be able to explain the invention to people in the field; currently a typical description both is too vague to be educating and broad enough to scare people off touching a particular subfield, not to mention that <i>just reading</i> the patent itself may literally triple your liability in case when you&#x27;re found infringing (justly or not).<p>> <i>commercializing of knowledge or technology without license.</i><p>This pretty much fits the definition of &quot;limiting access to knowledge/technology&quot; directly. Free access and commercialization of knowledge / technology (with some exceptions, like nuclear weapons) are good for progress, good for consumers, good for humanity... but bad for the commercializers, hence they try to limit it.",1451400903

Some cities use them for routine patrols in high-crime areas. Baltimore and Dallas have used them to break up poker games. In 2010 New Haven, Connecticut sent a SWAT team to a bar suspected of serving under-age drinkers. That same year heavily-armed police raided barber shops around Orlando, Florida; they said they were hunting for guns and drugs but ended up arresting 34 people for “barbering without a licence”. Maricopa County, Arizona sent a SWAT team into the living room of Jesus Llovera, who was suspected of organising cockfights. Police rolled a tank into Mr Llovera’s yard and killed more than 100 of his birds, as well as his dog. According to Mr Kraska, most SWAT deployments are not in response to violent, life-threatening crimes, but to serve drug-related warrants in private homes.<p>He estimates that 89% of police departments serving American cities with more than 50,000 people had SWAT teams in the late 1990s—almost double the level in the mid-1980s. By 2007 more than 80% of police departments in cities with between 25,000 and 50,000 people had them, up from 20% in the mid-1980s (there are around 18,000 state and local police agencies in America, compared with fewer than 100 in Britain).</i>",1451400109

It also was not easy to find a new part, so the company opted not to replace it.&quot;. Certainly a bad decision and it should be checked if regulations need to be changed to avoid similar problems in the future.<p>EDIT: The old version had used the wrong conversion factors, now corrected<p>The central number is the exhaust mass of 110,000 pounds per hour. So how much is this really? This is about 50 metric tons of methane per hour. To be able to compare it with other greenhouse emissions we can calculate the CO2 equivalent by multiplying with 0.01133[1] giving the rate of: 1247 metric tons CO2e per hour.<p>Using the EPA Online tool[2] we can relate this to the toal emissions in Calfornia or the US. The total emission of methan measured in CO2e for California in 2014 was: 9,546,270 metric tons CO2e. Converted to a rate per hour this gives: 1089 metric tons CO2e per hour.<p>So while the well is leaking it is releasing 114% of the normal methane emissions of California.<p>Compared to all greenhouse gas emissions the well is causing an increase of 10%  in california and 0.3%at the US national level compared to the emissions from large facilities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www3.epa.gov/gasstar/tools/calculations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www3.epa.gov/gasstar/tools/calculations.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/news/what-went-wrong-at-porter-ranch-6405804"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laweekly.com/news/what-went-wrong-at-porter-ranch...</a>",1451399900

10806798,comment,10799703,10799703,0,0,mbrock,,,"There&#x27;s a book called <i>The Spell of the Sensuous</i> by David Abram, and a sequel called <i>Becoming Animal</i>, that I think are relevant. They aren&#x27;t based on neuroscience but philosophy (mostly Merleau-Ponty phenomenology, a little bit of McLuhan, plus an interesting critique of alphabetic writing) and some field anthropology. Basically he is defending the importance of embodied cognition within non-man-made environments.<p>From the first book:<p>> <i>Today we participate almost exclusively with other humans and with our own human-made technologies. It is a precarious situation, given our age-old reciprocity with the many-voiced landscape. We still need that which is other than ourselves and our own creations. The simple premise of this book is that we are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.</i><p>I bet there&#x27;s also a bunch of articles written from a Heideggerian perspective about being-in-the-world as a hiker. I&#x27;d expect the &quot;three day effect&quot; to work very well when you are hiking from place to place, engaged in that kind of simple and &quot;primordial&quot; activity.<p>There&#x27;s a NASA report that I can&#x27;t find that was about psychological requirements for long-term living on space stations and one thing they recommended was an explorable space with height differences creating a shifting horizon, so you get that nice free feeling of walking in a landscape.<p>Which reminds me that <i>The Spell of the Sensuous</i> has an interesting discussion of Heidegger&#x27;s use of the concept of a horizon, and how it relates to the experience of time...<p>Oh yeah and I&#x27;ve heard lots of people say, and I concur, that meditation retreats usually shift in character after around the third day, like it takes about three days for the mind to really get into the new situation, fully adjust to the rhythm. After that there&#x27;s a different flow and meditation feels deeper.<p>BTW, I love hiking and meditation, but I&#x27;m a little wary of romanticism and religion. There&#x27;s interesting critique of the concept &quot;nature,&quot; for example Timothy Morton&#x27;s <i>Ecology Without Nature</i>. Yet there&#x27;s obviously lots of fascinating effects on mental health.<p>Then I&#x27;m also a little wary of &quot;scientizing&quot; or &quot;psychiatrizing&quot; both nature and meditation. It has to do with what Heidegger thought of as the technological mindset of treating the world as a big resource to use for various purposes.<p>I think there is some kind of truth in the way many hikers and meditators want to keep those things &quot;sacred&quot; in some way, regardless of what religious or romantic theoretical framework they use to justify that. If you try to use nature, or meditation, to alleviate the stress from your life, in an instrumental way full of expectations, I can easily see it gradually losing its efficacy, if it becomes yet another maintenance strategy and you lose the sense of noninstrumentality, free exploration, suspension of ordinary pursuits, etc.",1451399439

Note that you didn&#x27;t provide any numbers for &quot;most cops don&#x27;t overstep their bounds&quot; either.<p>If we consider &quot;killing citizens&quot; as &quot;overstepping their bounds&quot; (and I&#x27;d say is the most overstepping a policeman can do), then US police does it by about 1-2 orders of magnitude (70 - 100 times) more than other western countries...<p>Here are some actual hard numbers:<p><i>For instance, an April 2007 study of the Chicago Police Department found that out of more than 10,000 police abuse complaints filed between 2002 and 2003, only 19 (0.19%) resulted in meaningful disciplinary action. The study charges that the police department&#x27;s oversight body allows officers with &quot;criminal tendencies to operate with impunity,&quot; and argues that the Chicago Police Department should not be allowed to police itself.[29] Only 19% of large municipal police forces have a civilian complaint review board (CCRB). Law enforcement jurisdictions that have a CCRB have an excessive force complaint rate against their officers of 11.9% verses 6.6% complaint rate for those without a CCRB. Of those forces without a CCRB only 8% of the complaints were sustained.[30] Thus, for the year 2002, the rate at which police brutality complaints were sustained was 0.53% for the larger police municipalities nationwide.</i><p>Here are some more:<p><i>According to the 2014 Legatum Prosperity Index released in November, in the measure of personal freedom, the United States has fallen from 9th place in 2010 to 21st worldwide—behind such countries as Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Other such rankings systems show the US as low as 46.<p>Let’s look at our immediate neighbors to the north, Canada. The total number of citizens killed by law enforcement officers in the year 2014, was 14; that is 78 times less people than the US. If we look at the United Kingdom, 1 person was killed by police in 2014 and 0 in 2013. English police reportedly fired guns a total of three times in all of 2013, with zero reported fatalities. From 2010 through 2014, there were four fatal police shootings in England, which has a population of about 52 million. By contrast, Albuquerque, N.M., with a population 1 percent the size of England’s, had 26 fatal police shootings in that same time period.<p>China, whose population is 4 and 1/2 times the size of the United States, recorded 12 killings by law enforcement officers in 2014. Let that sink in. Law enforcement in the US killed 92 times more people than a country with nearly 1.4 billion people. It doesn’t stop there. From 2013-2014, German police killed absolutely no one.</i><p>And more:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/0...</a><p>And let&#x27;s not even get into BS like sending SWAT teams for any BS offense, like getting some stoned teenager...<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-america...</a>",1451399344

On the other hand, you have the usual publication/media bias and availability heuristic working against us.<p>Say 1 in 500 police interaction is bad (terrorizing innocents at gunpoint) and 1 in 10 000 is, well, criminal (police maiming or killing someone innocent). That&#x27;s 0.5% and 0.01% of all interactions, respectively. Even assuming that <i>all</i> police interactions, good and bad, are recorded in detail by third parties, in a country as big as the United States that still gives a steady stream of police brutality cases to run on nation-wide news, day after day.<p>So even though in my example the problem is minor and mostly random in nature, even when most people can go through their lives and never experience police behaving badly, the overall perception will be that police brutality is a big problem that absolutely needs to be dealt with right now. In fact, in this case, the only real problem is media reporting and people believing it instead of doing the math.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know the real numbers for the police problem in the US, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if cases of brutality were even rarer than in my example. And even if this is a totally 100% legit problem, there are many, many others - from terrorism to immigrants to vaccines causing autism - that are simply manufactured by news reporting. This all makes me believe that the biggest danger to our civilization are we ourselves - and our massive overreactions to media-manufactured non-problems.",1451398641

Rather than have to write a lot of abstracted out code to support mixins, and then know what assumptions a mixin has about the object choosing to mix it in, there are instead just functions; you want them then reference them, and what they take is spelled out (somewhat more) clearly in the function header, if you can pass in the right arguments, the function can be reused. If you want a set of functions that all work together, then composition, sharing state, etc, falls on you, rather than being implicit in assumptions the mixin and mixing class may make about each other. As you say, a question of taste (especially as to what steps you take to avoid those assumptions).<p>But that said, I&#x27;ve done similar things in merging two objects prior to serializing them out across a REST endpoint.

It would be borderline career suicide for any senior executive in a relevant position to hold their hands up and say they made a mistake on this one so soon.",1451397845

This is what leads to Mosler&#x27;s &quot;Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds&quot; and his policy proposals. That they&#x27;re frauds is <i>technically</i> correct from a national accounting POV, but taking them literally as the MMTers do can be disastrous. In fact, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> taking them literally that separates MMTers and other people. It&#x27;s not that mainstream economists aren&#x27;t aware of the logical implications of <i>ex nihilo</i> fiat money creation.<p>Also, MMT is nothing new or groundbreaking, contrary to their claims. There have been chartalist and endogenous money creation theories for ages, and most mainstream economists are quite aware of them, contrary to the assertions of many MMTers. What separates MMT from the rest is its fusion with more dubious Post-Keynesian theories.",1451397815

The popular stance is &quot;blame the banks&quot; and some people even believe that (commercial) bankers just print money (for themselves) whenever they feel like getting a nicer car.<p>Several places the paper state that the ultimate control of money creation is monetary policy i.e. not the banks. This is what I&#x27;d always thought before this idea of commercial banks having complete freedom became popular. It also states that the interest rate set by the central bank decides the rate of the loans, and thus the demand for them, and thus the amount of creation. Interestingly the link between the central bank rate and the commercial rate is not stated (I did not read it end-to-end). I always thought that ultimately they had to borrow from the central bank to remain solvent/meet reserve ratios. And that goes down as a debt to the central bank, whereas the central bank can genuinely create that loan from nowhere and <i>is</i> doing the creation.",1451397613

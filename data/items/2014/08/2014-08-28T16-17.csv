It&#x27;s anecdotal, but it&#x27;s been interesting to observe the changes as a rider.<p>In NYC, the demographics of Uber drivers and yellow medallion cab drivers are generally the same, and most Uber drivers previously drove either yellow medallion cabs or private cab services. Uber drivers seemed generally happier about their jobs, making far more money doing basically the same service.<p>For a while, nothing seemed to change about their experiences, as far as I could tell. Only about a year or so ago did I start to notice a change, and it wasn&#x27;t the one I&#x27;d expect.<p>Nowadays, <i>both</i> yellow medallion cab drivers and Uber drivers in NYC seem to have the same level of satisfaction with their job, and are generally unhappier with their line of work overall compared to a few years ago. Uber drivers who have driven for more than a year or two say they are making dramatically less money than they used to, and they complain that their costs are higher and revenues more unpredictable (such as Uber changing the requirements for what counted as Uber vs. Uber X, dramatically reducing revenue permanently).<p>One Uber driver told me that he was an early driver and used to rate passengers fairly, and now just gives everyone a 5-star, because &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot; (ie, he just doesn&#x27;t care).<p>On the other hand, Uber drivers used to tell me that they experienced a different sort of clientele. Taking Uber (instead of taking a cab) was a status symbol. One told me that he drove a guy literally a block and a half to a party, just so he could be seen stepping out of a black car. From what I&#x27;ve seen, as the service has grown, the clientele has regressed more to the mean, and is now more similar to the typical cab user (except a bit younger and more tech-savvy).<p>Uber (and the like) have been revolutionary services from the point of view of the rider, but from the perspective of the driver, it seems that the initial differences in experiences were only temporary.<p>[0] I started doing this simply because I have family members who used to drive cars in NYC professionally and still tell stories of their days. So I could relate to the riders, and they&#x27;d tell me their thoughts very candidly. Only much later did Uber come out and this turn into an opportunity for comparison.",1409243795

Even computer scientists need to program once in a while. A Computer Science program is doing a disservice to its &quot;Computer Scientists&quot; if it somehow manages to fail to teach them anything about programming.<p>And to be honest, I find it utterly, mindblowing absurd that anybody could take the alternative seriously. Think about it a bit.<p>In fact I&#x27;d go so far as to say that one of the several major problems facing the University system as a whole right now is this whole idea that theoreticians across all disciplines can somehow be fully severed from all practical considerations, as a result of too many people mindlessly chanting that Universities aren&#x27;t vocational programs. A theoretician operating without any input from the practical world is a theoretician wasting his or her time, producing theories that will ultimately not even be of academic interest.<p>(There are very, very specific disciplines in computer science that might be able to get away with 0 programming, <i>BUT</i> the generic undergrad courses would not be able to be that focused.

I suppose he is currently banking that most of Western Europe depends on his natural gas, so they cannot completely shut him out.<p>Yes, he is. This is as much about internal Russian politics as any international issues. The Russian economy is doing well, but most of the gains are concentrated in the hands of the ruling oligarchy. So the people haven&#x27;t seen much benefit, and are angry about their economic situation. Putin has put out a lot of nationalist propaganda blaming NATO (specifically the EU and USA) for any economic hardship the people face. This distracts from the fact that he and his buddies are basically robbing the country blind. He has cast himself as the &quot;defender of Russia&quot; in a geopolitical battle against the US and EU.<p>A large part of this nationalist campaign has focused on building a &quot;new Russian empire&quot; from the former Soviet bloc countries. They&#x27;ve used the auspices of protecting &quot;native Russians&quot; in these countries (even though the idea of a &quot;native Russian&quot; is laughably absurd since the USSR forced everyone to learn Russian anyway) by providing Russian passports to anyone who wants one. They use the threat of invasion to extort cooperation from these countries and keep them in the Russian sphere of influence. Ukraine overthrew its Russian-puppet government, which prompted the whole invasion of Crimea.<p>Putin knows that the EU needs his oil, so he&#x27;s testing his limits to see how much he can get away with. The EU has shown no signs of imposing any real sanctions because if they did, the EU would go through a similar situation that the US did in the 70s. So Russia&#x27;s infractions have to go so far that the EU is willing to plunge itself into recession.

We already had crazy leaders invade small neighboring countries, and we tried to appease them without raising too much of a fuss, so as to preserve economic interests. This is how it begins.<p>Now — we start to see history repeat itself, and what do European countries do? France seems to be fine with continuing to sell warships to Russia. Germany is mostly worried about economy and what the lack of Russian gas will do to it. Great Britain seems to be mostly occupied with thinking about whether to leave the EU.<p>We don&#x27;t necessarily need a full-blown conflict, but I&#x27;m of the opinion (that seems to be the majority opinion in Poland) that Europe should immediately impose <i>serious</i> sanctions and implement a plan to stop buying Russian oil&gas within, say, a year.

Having to manually discover the most useful libraries, maintain the code gluing each of these libraries to the rest of the code.<p>It&#x27;s a pain in the neck, doing it once or twice is fine, but once you start getting to around half a dozen projects or so in various states of development / production, going back to change the code on all of them when something changes gets pretty onerous.<p>I&#x27;ve started to recognize that I basically need to either be willing to either vendor dependencies or build interface classes to separate responsibilities.<p>So now I maintain an &#x27;extractions&#x27; gem that implements common patterns as modules. For example right now I&#x27;m building a Persistence module that I can include to persist data. Point it at the instance variable containing the data, stored as a Set of value class instances, tell it which engine to use, and the name of the value class it&#x27;s persisting, so it knows which columns to make in the table, and it handles all the dirty work automatically, presenting a clean interface to the calling library.<p>So now I can change or update the persistence library used in the extractions gem, say, by changing ActiveRecord to Sequel or even just separate DB libraries and templated queries, and all of my projects can use the new code with a simple &#x27;bundle update&#x27;. Shared conventions, made easier by other extractions, make everything work together fluidly.<p>Eventually I&#x27;d love to get to the point where I don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;bundle update&#x27;, running production code could poll the git server daily to see if the extractions gem has changed, then pull the repo and restart the server, the code for which can be stored, again, within the extractions gem.<p>This could get a little dangerous, so I&#x27;m eventually going to build a testing apparatus to test the effects of updating the extractions gem. Spin up a bunch of VMs, provision them, pull the repos, run the test suites and finally start the servers. Any errors get reported.",1409243169

For this we would provide 1-time login codes so the person can update the signature.

If, for example, a small non-NATO country with no nukes was to attack a member state, NATO would respond pretty quickly. In an alternate universe, if Ukraine (without any support from Russia) was to attack Poland, NATO would respond. But NATO is not strong enough to oppose Russia without major casualties. I believe that if all NATO member states were to at once attack Russia today, they would win but it would be a war, not a surgical strike. This is why we won&#x27;t see that happening.",1409242715

Healthier lifestyles increase the amount of &quot;later life care.&quot; See Japan as a perfect example, a very healthy aging population creating massive care market (and a big burden on the infrastructure).<p>People who live a healthier lifestyle live longer, and then get sick from old age (unavoidable). Which increases the amount and length of care. People who live an unhealthy lifestyle never make it to 65, thus never need &quot;later life care&quot; at all.<p>> For example, if we promote healthier eating habits, we might reduce the amount of late life treatment needed for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.<p>Most people with those types of conditions (due to lifestyle, not age) never make it to Medicare. You still get the age related versions of those, and you get things like hip/knee replacements, broken bones, cocktails of daily drugs, cancers, strokes, and so on.<p>No amount of healthy lifestyle will make older people cheap to care for. All you&#x27;ll do is increase the pool of older people by promoting healthier lifestyles.<p>If your goal is to increase the max average age of your population then healthier lifestyle promotion is going to accomplish that. If your goal is to reduce cost then doing &quot;nothing&quot; (and literally letting people die from their own neglect) is the thing to do.<p>People who argue the whole &quot;fatties/smokers cost us money&quot; thing haven&#x27;t even given it a tiny amount of thought. Both groups die young, older people are the most expensive care period, therefore fatties and smokers never make it to the super-expensive part of their lives which is &quot;good&quot; (in financial terms, not moral terms).<p>Do those groups get sick at younger ages? Yes. But propping someone up with diabetes from 40-50 is nothing in cost compared to keeping someone healthy from age 65-75, because at 65-75 you&#x27;ll still likely be treating diabetes but on top of that also tons of other ailments introduced by age.",1409242674

Stories about pro-russians being harassed by pro-western Urkainians and the government were (and are) abundant. From their point of view, a pro-russian government was illegitimately overthrown. General opinion seems to be that democracy only matters to the west as long as it&#x27;s not too inconvenient to them. Constant allegations and sanctions against Russia while they feel they have very little influence on what pro-russians are doing in Ukraine. Mostly, it seems like there&#x27;s a feeling of pro-russian sentiments being repressed, the west not giving a damn and Russia&#x27;s hand being tied via international pressure.<p>Meanwhile, when I look at the western media, it honestly disgusts me. While pro-russian media generally seems to ignore a lot of stories that put them in a negative light, the western media seems to actively  be painting pro-russian and Russia in a bad light. It&#x27;s a general trend I&#x27;ve noticed in where western media is often on the offensive, and the &quot;counter-party&quot; on the defensive. I guess it&#x27;s a cultural thing.<p>Regardless, the Ukrainian government has been making a fool of itself in both the western and eastern media. Since this whole thing started, they&#x27;ve done nothing but make unfounded allegations, trying to &quot;poke the bear&quot; (Russia) and instigate unrest. I feel that they&#x27;re responsible for a large part of the needless escalation in this conflict.<p>PS: Your use of the word &quot;propaganda&quot; is an excellent example of how we view things. Everything the &quot;other&quot; side says is propaganda, anything &quot;our&quot; side says is necessarily the truth. This happens on both sides of the conflict, and I think it&#x27;s a large barrier to actually start solving the problems. Rather than claiming &quot;propaganda&quot;, we should consider it points-of-view, and the first thing we should do is ask ourselves: why does the other side hold this point of view, and how come they view it as a completely legitimate moral view to have?<p>PPS: My girlfriend is, at times, greatly distressed by this whole thing. Like many Russians, almost half her family is in fact Ukrainian. Surprisingly, this seems to cause feelings of sympathy for those family members by both sides, yet they remain quite harsh against other Ukrainian or Russian viewpoints.",1409242564

I&#x27;ve spent way too many hours searching for a geocache once I was at the destination and often giving up. SuperTrip is my personal answer to that. Rather than use a GPS location, SuperTrip is only a direction and distance. The location is abstracted so you don&#x27;t know where you are going but at the same time, the final destination isn&#x27;t hidden. For me, it made it more of an adventure. Plus, once you reach a destination, you&#x27;ve made it. There is nothing physical at the locations, and the first version is only a pat on the back, but the goal is for there to be in-game rewards for reaching destinations. I just haven&#x27;t developed all of that yet.",1409242249

So, as it is meant to, voting protects the human rights of a population.<p>But it would be nice if that population would actually believe in human rights. Particularly if they want to portray themselves champions of the matter. But if your attitude is an example, &quot;screw that&quot;, huh?",1409241711

8237881,comment,8236054,8236054,2,0,wyc,,,"I typically code with the manual alongside my editor so syntax lookups are cheap. I prefer dumb and honest APIs coupled with good type systems so that understandable semantics are expressed within the routines themselves.<p>Therefore, I&#x27;m pretty apprehensive about using a system that seemingly encourages ambiguity, e.g. on page 6:<p>var epochMethodName = K.ask(clock, &quot;what is the name of that&#x27;s property (methodName) which represents the current time in Unix epoch format?&quot;).methodName<p>If the system is rigid and expects a structurally-similar sentence, then isn&#x27;t that specification more difficult to remember than simple method names? This could form an unnecessary implicit schema, basically the same as winded function calls.<p>If the system is extended enough to understand a variety structures conveying the same meaning, what guarantees do I have about maintaining a consistent result? We developed a separate language for mathematics to (among other reasons) eliminate ambiguity, e.g. the exclusive or due to the ambiguity of the word &quot;or&quot;. This reminds me of the Dijkstra paper on natural language programming that resurfaced on HN recently:<p><a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/E...</a><p>I don&#x27;t think within the code itself is the right place to help the computer make sense of my meaning. Such a complex system may mislead the user into thinking that the system is smarter or more capable than it really is, e.g. you can&#x27;t tell a toaster to K.ask(&quot;what&#x27;s your property (methodName) to bake a cake?&quot;). How is natural language-based service discovery different than a lookup for all APIs implementing the cake-baking interface? I don&#x27;t think I understand the bridge that the paper makes from natural-seeming language to formal logic.<p>Instead, I think something along the lines of this proposed system could useful when used while programming. While writing code, I would enjoy a way to look up &quot;a method for this object that does something along the lines of XYZ&quot;. I would be interested in a more powerful search engine for documentation that leverages type systems and comment-search more usefully than just word-matching. Right now, the closest thing is Stack Overflow.",1409241699

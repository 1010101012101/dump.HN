I don&#x27;t even have good autocomplete in most embedded IDE&#x27;s, and I <i>STILL</i> prefer maxExchangeBufferLengthBytes.  Here&#x27;s why--that name tells me many things at a glance:<p>max--limit of some form, probably should be positive<p>ExchangeBuffer--a buffer and it&#x27;s functional purpose<p>LengthBytes--a length (so likely <i>unsigned</i> and if I see differently I should pause) in <i>bytes</i> (not items).  You would be amazed at the number of bugs this circumvents.<p>That&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> amount of information conveyed in 30 bytes.  But that&#x27;s almost half of 80 columns.  Add in something like 8 column indents and <i>you can&#x27;t even name things well</i>.<p>And, that still probably doesn&#x27;t give me enough information.  I need to look at that to see if that is constant, and I probably need to see if I can touch that without concurrency considerations.<p>I read code far more often than I type it.  I read code after I have forgotten about it far more often than when it is fresh.<p>Naming things to enable me to come back to my code 6 years later, refresh my memory, and not screw up while doing it is the <i>single</i> most important task in my programming.<p>80 columns is simply not conducive to that.",1438987766

Falling house prices would be a boon for renters and first-time buyers (and probably for society at large), but their political clout is less than that of middle-aged, middle-class property owners.</i><p>Link baity article with no real &quot;answer&quot;. Rents and house prices follow simple supply and demand over long term. Cities are either already saturated or don&#x27;t allow new constructions limiting the supply however people never stop flocking to them year over year. Even the medium size cities see net inflow of 50K-100K people every year - which means you need that many more new housing units <i>each year</i>. So ultimately only a few % of people gets to live in city and everyone else are forced to suffer commute. This % keeps declining because population total keeps growing and so the rent keeps rising.<p>Rent control etc can distort the economics for a while but not over long run. They are just &quot;pain killers&quot; when what you need is real medicine. The real medicine is simply policies that diversifies the areas. For example, encourage businesses to move in surrounding towns by offering tax benefits, build solid transportation network, open new public schools, encourage more constructions outside popular area, build communities with attractive facilities, build venues for cultural and sports events outside of cities and so on.",1438987429

        some nested expression that is very long but may not need to wrap
        but if it does there&#x27;s tons more room for it))

I.e. you don&#x27;t have to differentiate between &#x27;syntax indents&#x27; and &#x27;expression indents&#x27;, every thing is just an indent of the same size. Which has the advantage that almost every editor can indent it correctly, and it works with both space and tab indents, whereas you&#x27;re at the mercy of your Python editing mode whether the &#x27;indent to sibling&#x27; works for everyone (and if not, the programmer has to sit tapping space to line it up right). Both approaches are in PEP8, but i find that simple change removes 99% of all >80 line cases for me.<p>The only caveat, also covered in PEP 8 is for function definitions.<p><pre><code>    def some_descriptive_function_name(one_parameter,

3226884,comment,3226223,3226671,1,0,pbz,,,"Yes, convey separation, but after a certain number of pixels  white space is not as effective anymore. Notice how in the example of the table he argues that for wider tables using white space is not effective, and that delineation using colors should be applied.<p>The brain has to look at a layout and make sense out of it. In real life we're aided by contrast to make sense where one object starts and where the other begins -- without contrast you end up with camouflage. When using white space our brains figure out the delineation based on positioning. If blocks of text are perfectly aligned we fill out the delineation automatically; so lines are not necessary. This process breaks down over large areas since our field of vision is small and we would have to scan the whole area before we would make sense of it.<p>In the new Gmail layout, the menu items are aligned to the left, and so is the content. There are no ""lines"" between the menu and content the brain can fill out. Of course we can tell where one stops and the other starts, but it takes longer, it wastes more brain cycles than necessary.<p>Based on the screenshot we do no see the same version. In your version you have a separation between the menu area and the body of the email, the buttons have text and not icons, so we're not arguing over the same layout. Also, I do not see a classic theme being available.<p>EDIT: I don't see a classic theme that would look like your screenshot.",1321063008

It's amazing how thoroughly they can transform a young person, but even so there are some people that just aren't good enough, and the Marine Corps has always been the most willing of all services to get rid of dead weight.

Mutt is generally the more useful of the two.  One of the advantages, again, of offlineimap is that I've got the option of doing either.  And while I'll fully admit that there are some mails for which a full GUI client is more useful, plain text still wins in most instances.  And even where I'm not in mutt (say, on an Android device), straight text virtually always wins.<p>I'll also admit to using GMail's filter rules to classify my mail, though they have problems, most notably the inability to un-archive specific messages, or to re-order / order filters at all.

I then have another panel with a set of shortcuts that I can use to launch my most common apps.<p>With gnome-shell you are stuck with having 1 ""dock"" panel on the far left of 1 monitor to switch apps, even though apps are grouped this makes it far less convenient to switch between them. Instead of 1 click to switch, it's press a button , scan the mouse to the far left then click and then usually click again for the window I want.<p>The <i>big</i> problem however is this, \nsome of the apps I use are launched from shell scripts which will do something and then run some Java or python app. This is the way with many apps that are not installable through apt-get. IntelliJ IDEA is an example of this.<p>What I do in gnome2 is just create a new launcher that points to the script and add it to the panel, problem solved.<p>Now with gnome shell or unity , I can run my script from the terminal which will then cause the app to launch. However now when I want to dock the app for easy launch later it just won't let me.<p>This is probably because it doesn't understand the relationship between the shell script I ran and what it sees as the ""application"" and since there is nowhere else I can really put the app I am now relegated to having to launch some of my apps through the terminal each time because they cannot be docked into the main dock with the rest of my apps.",1321062283

3226853,comment,3225917,3225917,14,0,codeslush,,,"I spent four years in the U.S.M.C in the enlisted ranks.  This article is an interesting read, but only really scratches the surface of what one learns in the military.  I didn't spend a single day in a war zone, and still learned patience and acceptance.  I also learned much, much more - and they are skills that have helped me in my civilian life - personally and professionally.<p>I won't enumerate everything here; if I tried, I would fail.  But I will attempt to highlight many of those that repeatedly surface:<p>1. Attention to detail.  I don't think it matters what your military occupation is, you will certainly be subjected to this, at least in the Marines.  It starts with boot camp, and continues through your career.  The little things make a big difference.  While some of the military training tactics leave you, this one seems to stay - at least that's been my experience.<p>2. Initiative.  If something doesn't look right, can be done better, needs to be done - do it!  I don't even think I recognized this was instilled in me until I was back in the civilian sector.  It does wonders for a career!<p>3. Respect.  Respect for everyone - above, beside and below you.  This was especially difficult for me during my first two years of enlistment.  I thought I knew it all.  The promotion structure in the military has a huge time factor built into it.  For me, I thought many of those of higher rank were ignorant.  Guess what?  It doesn't matter!  You learn to respect them.  You learn to understand you're ignorant too.  You learn how to work with all different types of personalities, levels of intelligence, ethnicity, etc... - and you learn how to respect each of them for what they bring to the table.  You never know what a person has been through to get to where they are now or why they make the decisions they make.  There is almost always a reason.  Respect them enough to try to understand.  This has allowed me to work with and for all types of people in the civilian sector and I somehow manage to get along with almost everyone.  In the rare event that I don't get along with someone, I'm able to deal with it without trashing them.  It's usually representative of some flaw of my own anyway.<p>4. Camaraderie.  Especially true during times of war, but also true in times of peace.  The ""bond"" Dan spoke about comes from a lot of factors, but they all boil down to difficult, common experiences and trust.  Civilians don't always understand some of the methods in which these bonds are created.  By the time I got my blood stripes pinned on, it was not an accepted practice because of media exposure.  But I wanted to earn them and my unit allowed it.  It's a hazing ritual that is very painful to go through.  My wife thought I was nuts.  I feel that I earned those stripes and I know my unit had my back during the process.  You've seen stories in the media where some of these events have gone bad.  Examples include:  Blood/Wing Pinning and Shellback Ceremony.  I would suggest boot camp is largely a hazing ritual in and of itself.  Controversial as it may be, I believe these rituals play an important part in the life of a soldier.  It may not look good on TV, but neither does some of the stuff that happens while fighting for your life in the middle of a battle (things I know nothing about).<p>5. Tenacity.  Everything isn't always easy.  You don't quit at something just because it is hard or because you can't figure it out or because someone pissed you off.  Keep pressing forward.<p>6. Integrity.  Integrity is more than just telling the truth.  It's being the truth.  It's being true to you and to your (fill in the blank).  It's being professional.  It's standing up for people when they aren't there to stand up for themselves.  It's not gossiping.  It's not trying to cheat to get ahead of the next person.  It's about doing your best and when success comes, you know you earned it honestly.<p>7. Adapt and overcome.  Speaks for itself.<p>Some of the comments here speculate about why the military doesn't have a larger tech representation.  Other comments question the intellectual capacity of some of the soldiers.  Let me say this:  I worked with some of the smartest people of my life while in the Marines.  I worked with some of the more challenged too.  I worked with some of the smartest people in my life while in the civilian sector.  I worked with some of the more challenged too.<p>I didn't reenlist for two primary reasons:  (1) I wanted to make more money as a provider for my family and (2) I didn't want to relocate my family every two or three years.  Yesterday represented 16 years since my last day of active duty service, and I can reflect back and say it was one of the best experiences of my life.<p>Happy Veteran's Day to all past and present military members.",1321062215

While it may be natural to <i>draw</i> or <i>write</i> on a screen with a stylus, jabbing at buttons on a screen with a stylus is no more intuitive or natural than jabbing at a screen with a finger, and in many use cases (scrolling, zooming, panning) is much less natural. The case for the stylus becomes even weaker in the face of technology like Siri, which elegantly solves the problem of text input.<p>The Bret Victor ""Rant"" mentioned in the article makes the case for exploring more dynamic, tactile, interactive experiences, decidedly <i>not</i> limited to one mode of input like the stylus. I, for one, hope for a future that is much more ambitious than the stylus, with new forms of interaction that combine hands, voice, and beyond.

Give me a three inch 160x160 screen, an onscreen keyboard composing less than half of that resolution, and a stylus, and I can type twice as fast as a teenager with a thumbboard.

It's really just a check in the block.  If you have nothing else on your resume, then you probably need something better than a BA in underwater basket weaving from the University of Pheonix, but in your case you could get exactly that degree and then go to an officer recruiter and leverage the rest of your resume to find an appropriate career field.<p>If you had a high school diploma, you'd still have lots of good opportunities.  Most of the truly technical jobs in the military are performed by enlisted personnel.  Some officer jobs are relatively technical (engineers and other acquisition-related career fields, aviators, nuclear power officers, etc.), but all officers are expected to be leaders first and foremost.  Even officers in technical-sounding career fields (e.g. cryptology) serve primarily in a leadership/managerial/administrative role, with the enlisted personnel under them performing the hands-on work.  In the early days of computers, all of the computer programmers in the Navy were enlisted, because their job title included the phrase ""technician,"" and officers don't serve as technicians, enlisted men do.  Lately there has been a realization that some technical jobs require a level of knowledge that most high school graduates simply don't possess, and so the Navy recently established a new officer designator for hackers:\n<a href=""http://www.informationwarriors.net/showthread.php?t=623"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationwarriors.net/showthread.php?t=623</a><p>An interesting thing about this designator is that it still preserves the idea that officers are supposed to be leaders, via a very unique and unusual mechanism: any officer with this designator must, after five years, either change designators or leave the Navy.  I'm willing to bet that this requirement is based on the idea that this isn't really a leadership job, and that they're willing to have very junior officers in non-leadership positions, but that after a certain point they want them to shift their focus to leadership like all other officers.",1321060348

They felt that the products had shortcomings but that was ok because they were so cheap.<p>The only two exceptions--pen-based computing products that had found significant success at their MSRP--were Wacom and Palm/Handspring.<p>The key to the mystery was handwriting recognition. 100% recognition is impossible, even for humans. But while we accept human misses, there is pretty much no tolerance for misses in a computing interface. With a miss, the value of the pen input (speed and natural feel) is lost in the need to correct.<p>Wacom succeeds because it does not even try to do handwriting recognition.<p>Palm/Handspring succeeded by inventing new motions for per-letter entry that people had to learn (called Graffiti). This reversed the user expectation: if the recognition failed, many users would assume it was their own fault for not doing the Graffiti entry properly. They wouldn't blame the machine, so their opinion of its value did not suffer.<p>Styluses are still hugely popular for animators, artists, and some graphic designers. Wacom is still going strong. But any computer that relies on a stylus for text entry is probably doomed to fail.",1321059712

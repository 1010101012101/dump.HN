2723435,comment,2722833,2722897,6,0,cturner,,,"<p><pre><code>    I never really understood why they didn't grasp pointers
</code></pre>
The root of the problem is the language designers' loose use of star. ""star something"" is contained in a phrase that means one thing at declaration, ""star something"" has a different meaning the rest of the time.<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>
    void eg(int i) {
        int *j = &i; // ""huh? Put the address of i into *j?""
        *j = *j + 1;
        printf(""%d\n"", *j);
    }
    int main() {
        eg(4);
    }
</code></pre>
With more detail. In the line..<p><pre><code>    int *var = something;
</code></pre>
.. the system assigns to the pointer. Yet in..<p><pre><code>    *var = 6;
</code></pre>
.. it assigns to the contents of the pointer.<p>Common usage creates further room for confusion:<p><pre><code>    int *var; // <- this is what people write
    int* var; // <- instead of this
</code></pre>
If they'd made the syntax "".int var"", and then used * solely for dereferencing, people wouldn't have these problems learning pointers. Consider<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>
    void eg(int i) {
        .int j = &i;
        *j = *j + 1;
        printf(""%d\n"", *j);
    }
    int main() {
        eg(4);
    }
</code></pre>
Further confusion comes from (1) special arrangements around string declaration and (2) printf use of %s to expect a string pointer when %d and %f expects (non-pointer) simple int and simple float.<p><pre><code>    char* something = ""huh? so now this does goe into *something?"";</code></pre>",1309686840

2723433,comment,2721821,2722794,3,0,rasmusrn,,,"Sprockets can be used for JS, CSS, images, and so on, because it is so simple: it is ""just"" concatenation. I understand and agree on the benefit/complexity argument.<p>But the fact that this method works universally, is also the reason it cannot accomodate individual needs for each ""asset type"" (css, js):<p>* For Javascript we cannot use CommonJS (or something similar)<p>* For SCSS we cannot use variables, mixins<p>For me, this means a lot. Traditionally, Rails has been giving me the best web environment experience I could imagine. With Rails 3.1, I can't help thinking: Why did they leave some of the best parts out?<p>I know I actually CAN use SCSS variables and mixins - I just have to use SCSS' @import rather than Sprockets own =require. But that leads to my stance in this matter: If we need to bypass Sprockets in order to get the cool features, then why use it in the first place?<p>We should use a system designed specifically for JS to management our JS, and a system specifically for CSS to manage CSS. Stitch and SASS comes to mind of course.<p>While I understand the benefits of the ""Sprockets way"", I'd like to see Rails use specific tools for specific asset types in order to give developers easy access to all of the available features instead of just 80% of them.",1309686651

2723417,comment,2722833,2723389,6,0,gregjor,,,"The Go language tutorial and examples look right at home alongside K&R. Likewise jQuery and other Javascript libraries, where terseness is valued due to bandwidth rather than screen size.<p>The idiomatic C style is so natural to me now I don't see it as a defect to fix or a game I'm playing. It's how I learned to program in C because I learned from K&R, and if they aren't the authorities I don't know who is. When I see wordy and bloated Java-style code it reminds me of the years I spent writing COBOL. Ultimately, though, it's not efficiency or a desire to show off or confuse other programmers that influences my style. To me code that does what it needs to with no extra fluff is beautiful.<p>When I see<p><pre><code>  while (*s++ = *t++) ;

I <i>know</i> what it does -- I don't need any comments or ""descriptive"" variable name or an explicit test for a null byte to make it clearer. If a programmer comes across a line of code that he or she doesn't understand the fault may be with the author, but it may be with the reader. In my experience there are a lot of unskilled programmers who quickly decide that any code they look at is badly written and should be thrown out. I don't think I should dumb down my code just so programmers less fluent with C can understand it. I have to consult a dictionary sometimes when I read Cormac McCarthy or Nabokov but I don't think they should write with easier words for my sake.",1309685956

6793133,comment,6791707,6792321,3,0,makomk,,,"Nope, it&#x27;s entirely correct. During the consensus process, each server only listens to servers that its operator has marked as trusted - there is no way for servers outside the trusted clique to affect in the consensus within the clique. This has a few consequences:<p>- Currently, there&#x27;s a small clique of servers run by OpenCoin Inc and their partner businesses which only trust each other and which everyone uses. The ledger closure process and transaction acceptance are effectively centrally controlled by that group; if your server closes the ledger itself rather than waiting for the official ledger from on high, it will be permanently stuck on its own fork of the network.<p>- Because of the way the ledger closure process works, if you set up your server wrong and end up in a part of the trust network that&#x27;s poorly connected to the official servers you will end up permanently stuck on your own fork of the transaction history. (In practice, since you can&#x27;t disagree with the official OpenCoin servers and you can&#x27;t influence their consensus, you should just set your trust list to the OpenCoin-approved list exactly and forget about peer-to-peer stuff.)<p>- There&#x27;s a mandatory transaction fee in a virtual currency, XRP, and unlike in Bitcoin the XRP used in that transaction fee is destroyed. The fee is set as part of the ledger consensus process, which is controlled by OpenCoin Inc. They also control the supply of XRP. In effect, there&#x27;s a central organisation with the power to charge arbitrarily large fees for the use of Ripple.",1385369913

Mostly in your final application you&#x27;ll be writing to a database, but you&#x27;d like to keep the option of writing to different types of storage (files on disk, amazon S3, memory for testing).<p>Polymorphism lets your database storage object present the same interface as your file storage object. Pretty useful if you want to be able to substitute them!<p>Encapsulation lets you make sure at compile-time that you haven&#x27;t accessed anything specific to a particular implementation. If someone else maintains that part of the system, it also lets them mark interface parts that won&#x27;t change between versions and some implementation parts that may change between versions.<p>Implicit state mutation lets you open the file (or create the file or establish the database connection pool) on the first attempt to access, letting multiple implementations present the same interface even when different things are going on in the background.<p>Inheritance is useful if you have multiple objects - maybe you have one for reading inputs, one for storing work-in-progress, one for writing outputs - and you want to reduce code duplication by sharing implementation details.

Simpson, and Amy Fisher, and Nancy Kerrigan could feed a news cycle for months, if not years, TV lost a lot of charm. It was the popularity of the O.J. Simpson case that spawned the Court TV channel.<p>Right around the time when the constantly scrolling, but nigh-unreadable news ticker showed up on all of the news channels, TV mutated into this hideous disease that vomited itself into my living room.<p>Somewhere amidst the election ads and the telephone ads, the Big Pharma ads came along, with Montel Williams and Rikki Lake and Jerry Springer, and then Realty TV exploded for beyond the already intolerable spectacle of MTV&#x27;s The Real World. Vapid scummy channels like E! spewed forth with shallow, narcissistic tabloid hopelessness. MTV itself devolved into TRL and Britney Spears and then 9/11 and Iraq blew all the gaskets open.<p>With every celebrity fearing for their pathetic career, at the very premise of disagreeing with a &quot;Wartime President&quot;, that very chilling effect of self censorship attenuated all intelligence on TV.<p>The internet, meanwhile, was uncensored, unfiltered virgin wilderness to explore. Hard core pornography and gore sites were immediately available, and you didn&#x27;t have to skulk around the adult section of the video store for Faces Of Death or Debbie Does Dallas. You also didn&#x27;t have to pay extra to get a glipse of tits or hear some curse words on HBO. TV knows this, and has grown even creepier still, in an attempt to compete with the total lack of boundries found on the internet, to the point where it feels disturbingly questionable that Cialis ads are directly juxtaposed with Honey Boo Boo episodes.<p>The rationale for Court TV finally died about a decade and a half after the O.J. Simpson case, and by then it had transformed itself into a dumping ground for re-runs of To Catch A Predator and COPS, and then rebranded as TRU TV, and now also includes shows about repo men harassing irresponsible poor people.<p>At these times scales of ten to fifteen years for a complete life cycle of a trend like the one caused by O.J. Simpson, I shudder to think what TV will be like when the 9/11, Iraq War, Fox News trend cycle wraps up. The current trend feels like it still needs about ten more years to fully play itself out.",1385367819

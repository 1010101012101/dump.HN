Slack was built for collaboration from day 1, so there is some amount of lock in (change management in an organization is tough).<p>I look at Slack as being more like a hybrid of the best parts of Box + Dropbox... They have the good parts of Box&#x27;s business model and the UX quality of Dropbox.

10715527,comment,10712446,10715339,0,0,glial,,,"> Don&#x27;t big alarm bells go off in your head when you hear N parameters for N data points?<p>Gaussian process models typically also have hyperparameters that control things like the smoothness of the learned surface. My hand-wavey sense of how GPs work is that you have a prior distribution over functions (think curves) and a hyperparameter controlling the smoothness/length-scale of those functions. You observe data, then find the posterior distribution over functions that make your data most likely - i.e. of all these possible functions, which ones have the best chance of actually generating the data you&#x27;re observing? The shape of that posterior distribution depends on the set of N points you observe, and it will be different if you have different data.  In that sense, then, the data are parameters, since the posterior depends exactly on the set of data.<p>The analogy to traditional regression comes by having the hyperparameters (controlling the covariance function IIRC, i.e. the smoothness of the posterior curves), which allows the resulting posterior distribution to explain the data perfectly (overfitting, sharp curves) or not (generalizability, smooth curves).  See for example slides 23-24 of this slide deck:<p><a href=""https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc2515/notes/gp_slides_fall08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc2515/notes/gp_slides_f...</a><p>Rasmussen has some useful video tutorials of all this.

10715502,comment,10712045,10714729,0,0,Blueliner,,,"Stripe ACH service has been in &quot;beta&quot; for at least two years. I contacted them that long ago and was told it would be available by the end of 2014 and it is still in &quot;beta&quot; and not generally available. As the co-founder of an enterprise SaaS app startup where our average per use charge for a customer to use our app (we charge on a per use basis not straight subscription) starts in the hundreds of dollars and can run into the thousands paying the standard 2.9% + credit card fees for every payment vs. $.10 - $.50 max for an ACH charge is a complete non-starter for us and our customers. All of Stripe&#x27;s competitors have had ACH forever including Balanced who we talked to but Stripe continues to drag its feet and not provide ACH. Clearly it isn&#x27;t for technical reasons but because they make significantly more revenue and profit by not offering ACH where their transaction fee is much less. So while I respect what Stripe did early on to make integrating payments into an app much easier than the previous generation payment providers requiring a lot of up front fees, merchant accounts, etc. we will never consider them again unless and until they offer ACH and I&#x27;m sure there are lots of other enterprise app companies who won&#x27;t use them either without ACH because customers demand it vs. having to run up huge monthly charges on their company credit cards. Too bad that Stripe management is proven to put their profits (and greed) ahead of providing cost effective solutions for their customers.",1449809035

They start screwing with the protocol itself and making everything refuse to work at all unless it is running the latest version.  Then they introduce more ads and a generally scummier experience from one release to the next.<p>Even all of <i>that</i> was almost tolerable.

Just because you can&#x27;t sit on the chair doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t an absolute answer. I think you understand that after parsing your response a bit more, just wanted to call the point out specifically.<p>Yes, there is an absolute answer. But if you don&#x27;t know it, you don&#x27;t get to make one up and to then claim it&#x27;s the truth, you simply don&#x27;t know it, and that&#x27;s it, until you do actually know it, for example by sitting down on the chair.<p>>> However, it is important to note that science does not proclaim that if you can&#x27;t observe something, it therefore isn&#x27;t.\n> \n> Yes! I understand this. But I do think that because science is so great at explaining so many things, people will tend to mentally fall into assumptions like &#x27;science is the only way to prove something&#x27; or &#x27;if science cannot prove something, I won&#x27;t believe it&#x27;. This could be strawmanning though.<p>First of all, I want to draw a distinction: Science doesn&#x27;t _prove_ anything, at all. Proof is the business of mathematics, and a proof only shows what follows logically from a given set of assumptions (called axioms by mathematicians), which doesn&#x27;t say much about reality, as the assumptions are just assumptions, which might apply in reality, or they might not, mathematics doesn&#x27;t care whether they do, it only shows what follows if you assume them to be true.<p>Science only deals with evidence, and it works by falsification, not by verification, let alone by proof. Science works by suggesting hypotheses and then trying to disprove them as hard as possible. Hypotheses that survive those attempts to disprove them for long enough are considered tentatively reliable knowledge, aka theories, not proven facts, as it is always assumed that future tries to disprove some theory might still succeed.<p>Now, yes, I won&#x27;t believe something that science hasn&#x27;t demonstrated (that is: hasn&#x27;t tried reasonably hard to disprove). However, you have to be careful to not understand &quot;science&quot; as &quot;by people in labcoats&quot; here. Any method that has been demonstrated to provide reliable knowledge is scientific. If you could show that personal revelation is a path to reliable knowledge, I would count personal revelation as scientific evidence, and thus believe personal revelations. I don&#x27;t dogmatically exclude any method of obtaining knowledge--all I ask for is that you demonstrate that it actually works, at which point it both becomes scientific and I will believe it. As long as I don&#x27;t have anything beyond your claim that your method works, I won&#x27;t believe what you say. &quot;Unscientific&quot; really is just a synonym for &quot;hasn&#x27;t been demonstrated to provide reliable knowledge&quot;--and I would think it&#x27;s obvious that you can&#x27;t justify a claim with a method of which it is unknown whether it works.<p>> If I understand you correctly you&#x27;re saying that, from a purely scientific standpoint, a belief in the Abrahamic God is no different than believing that we&#x27;re a little simulation run by the Q Continuum. And that&#x27;s a fair point.<p>What I am saying is that there is as much evidence for one as for the other, hence, there is no justification for believing one more or less than the other.<p>> But I would contend again that science is not the only way to prove something. Historical record, internal logic and narrative, testimony of others, personal experience, revelation...these can be less easy to parse and trust than a clear-cut scientific method, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate them as methods of persuasion.<p>Historical records are quite easy to observe, actually. But you don&#x27;t get to just claim what they say, and that what they say is true. You have to demonstrate both the actual content of the actual records and that they are reliable, if you want me to believe something you supposedly found out about history. BTW, there isn&#x27;t really all that much difference between historical records and any other kind of observation/measurement: The light from the screen that you are reading this on takes time to travel to your eyes, so what you see is also just a sort of historical record of the screen&#x27;s content about a nanosecond earlier, just as much of the knowledge about the early development of our universe has been obtained by looking at light that has been traveling through the universe for billions of years, much of it from galaxies that probably don&#x27;t even exist anymore. If you can observe it, you can use it as scientific evidence.<p>(Internal) logic is a somewhat difficult case, but then again it is actually not that much of a problem: It&#x27;s philosophically difficult to pin down the &quot;source of logic&quot; (not that I&#x27;m saying that there is such a thing), but in practice, you won&#x27;t find many people who will disagree with you about the most basic laws of logic, so there isn&#x27;t really much need to justify them. Though it should be noted that you can empirically observe that they work, that is, if you use them, you are more successfull at navigating the world than if you don&#x27;t.<p>Narrative is probably a source of hypotheses to test at best, testimony of other is perfectly fine scientific evidence, of course--however, the observation of the testimony is not to be confused with the observation of what the testimony is about. In order to use the former to judge the latter, you also need observations about the reliability of the testimony. Note that we know most of our (scientific) knowledge only &quot;through testimony&quot;--but what is important is that you in principle can go and repeat any of the experiments or observations that that testimony supposedly was based on to see whether it holds up. Personal experience is, if you will, the primary source of scientific knowledge--however, we also have figured out that it is extremely unreliable on its own, which is why science has developed elaborate methodology to avoid all the biases, confusions, and deceptions that individual personal experience tends to come with. As for revelation, see above.<p>But no, ultimately, there are no other ways to obtain reliable knowledge than by using methods that have been demonstrated to result in reliable knowledge, aka science.<p>> And perhaps that is our greatest difference. You (if I am understanding correctly; feel free to correct me) believe that belief should be withheld on things that cannot be quantified with scientific methodology. I do not ascribe to this, and this divergence puts us in pretty different places.<p>I would disagree on the wording. &quot;quantified with scientific methodology&quot; sounds too much like &quot;by people in labcoats&quot;, and that&#x27;s besides the point. Belief should be withheld until you can show that it aligns with reality.<p>>>>> what is moral is a scientific question >> I can see how you could start with that assumption and find ways to justify it, but I don&#x27;t see how you can conclusively prove the initial premise. > I think the more interesting question is: Do you disagree and if so, why?\n> \n> If I understand the intent of this exchange, then I think I do disagree. Take something like eugenics; if we observed two societies doing it and one refraining, we might find benefits in both society. An individualistic society might be glad they refrained because they see the intrinsic value of each human life, regardless of their shortcomings, while a collectivistic, Spartan-like society might be glad they kept their stock strong and didn&#x27;t have to do stuff like buy glasses or spend money on sick/disabled people. Point being, observation and the conclusions that are drawn from it could end up being inconclusive or relativistic depending on the underlying values of the society.<p>Well, sure we might find benefits in both societies, but which of the two do you think would be nicer to live in, all things considered?<p>Also, yes, observations could end up inconclusive, so you might have to make an arbitrary decision as to how to live. How does just making up an answer from the start and skipping the observation make things any less arbitrary than that worst case?<p>And do you have any evidence that morals do not depend on the underlying values of societies? That you wish they weren&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t make it so.<p>[...]",1449806783

I&#x27;ve really come to enjoy discussions on Hacker News more than anywhere else.<p>:-)<p>>> I am speaking of observation, not revelation.\n> \n> Me too. There were lot of observations about people and events in first-century Palestine that were then recorded and preserved over time.<p>Sure, and based on that evidence I agree with you that there were humans living in first-century Palestine, for example.<p>> I was just in a meeting today. Let&#x27;s say I write a blog post about it and that post is read 2000 years later. While it can&#x27;t be the sole basis for answering the question of whether or not that meeting happened, I think it should be given a lot of respect and precedence when considering the question.<p>Well, that very much depends.<p>If the claim simply was that there was some meeting today in some company and that your were in it, and whether I believe it or not was essentially inconsequential, sure, might well have happened, that doesn&#x27;t contradict anything I know about this world, there are meetings in companies all the time, and I assume that will still be a well-established fact 2000 years from now.<p>Now, if you asked me to bet my house on the truth of the claim that that meeting actually happened? No way I&#x27;d do that just based on a simple blog posting, even today, blog postings are just way too easy to fake.<p>Or if you claimed that in that meeting someone demonstrated that energy conservation doesn&#x27;t hold, or that the speed of light can be exceeded, or that you resurrected a dead human ... no, your blog post wouldn&#x27;t count for much as far as those claims are concerned, if anything at all, we have pretty solid evidence that energy is conserved, that the speed of light cannot be exceeded, and that rotting human bodies cannot be resurrected, at least with current medical technology. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.<p>> But don&#x27;t discount revelation outright! If I want someone to understand me better, I&#x27;d rather tell them myself rather than having them resort to observations and experiments, and I&#x27;d probably give them more information in an hour of talking than they ever could figure out on their own.<p>But first of all, listening to someone speak is perfectly fine observation, there is nothing supernatural about humans producing sound waves in patterns of some spoken language and other humans detecting/observing those sound waves, and secondly, if you said to me &quot;I know everything&quot;, the observation I make is that you said &quot;I know everything&quot;, not that you actually know everything, those two are two very distinct claims that would require very different evidence. Also, usually, if you talk to someone, you usually aren&#x27;t limited to just listening and watching, you can even do interactive experiments, such as ask a question and then observe the reaction of the other person. That&#x27;s how you usually figure out other people.<p>All of that demonstrably can provide reliable knowledge about the world. In contrast to the &quot;having an experience&quot;, personal/internal type of revelation, which has an abysmal track record. Note though that I don&#x27;t &quot;discount [it] outright&quot;--if you claim that that can provide reliable knowledge about the world, sure, possibly, but don&#x27;t expect me to believe that until you have demonstrated it. I don&#x27;t hold much hope for it though, given how contradictory claims are that people have made, supposedly based on such revelations, both versus one another and when compared to other (demonstrably reliable) methods of observation.<p>> If you can explain it completely, it&#x27;s not faith. So that makes sense.<p>There is no such thing as &quot;explain it completely&quot;. There is &quot;you can explain it&quot;, aka &quot;you know it&quot;, and there is &quot;you can&#x27;t explain it&quot;, aka &quot;you don&#x27;t know it&quot;. But there is no such thing as &quot;completeness&quot; in explanations. In a sense, there is no such thing as an explanation. There are models of reality, which colloquially are called explanations, but they are nothing more than descriptions of regularities that have been observed, and in every(!) model there are details of which we don&#x27;t know whether more details couldn&#x27;t possibly be found out at a later time. Why do we have day and night? Because the earth is spinning! Why is the earth spinning? Because it got angular momentum from the accretion disc around the sun that it formed in, and angular momentum is conserved! Why is angular momentum conserved? ... ad infinitum, or rather, until you get to the point where we don&#x27;t know (yet), which is the point where the responsible thing to say is &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, not &quot;<whatever>, because I have faith&quot;, because only &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; logically leads to you possibly finding out, if you pretend you know even though you don&#x27;t, chances are, you won&#x27;t.<p>> The concept of a triune God is one that kinda ends up this way. I can pontificate all I want about how I&#x27;m a father, a son, and a brother all while being a single entity, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s like explaining depth to Flatlanders - it&#x27;s tough to truly understand something that doesn&#x27;t exist on your level. So, what goes beyond my comprehension requires faith.<p>No, what goes beyond your comprehension, you don&#x27;t comprehend, and chances are it&#x27;s bullshit. If you can&#x27;t comprehend something, you can&#x27;t determine whether it&#x27;s true, so, while it&#x27;s quite possible that it is in fact true, it&#x27;s just as possible that it&#x27;s false, and without you being able to determine which of the two is the case by means of comprehension, just believing something &quot;on faith&quot; becomes a random game of chance, on some things you will be right, on others you will be wrong.<p>Humanity has heaps of experience with this method of obtaining supposed knowledge, by the way. People over time have believed all kinds of crazy shit &quot;on faith&quot;--that is to say: Stuff that we meanwhile have a working understanding of, much of which turned out to be wildly different from what people had sincerely held beliefs about &quot;on faith&quot;. Luckily, some people avoided believing this supposed knowledge, so we now know, to pick a random example, about bacteria. People were perfectly convinced that demons were real, and they even developed &quot;demon therapy&quot; ... but as you might know, exorcism didn&#x27;t quite do the trick, antibiotics did.<p>> Can it be used as a cop-out or an intellectually lazy answer? Sure! The Bible even suggests that faith is hard - a man once said to Jesus &quot;I believe; help my unbelief!&quot; But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a valid state of mind.<p>No, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a valid state of mind. But it also doesn&#x27;t mean that it _is_ a valid state of mind. If you claim that it&#x27;s a method to obtain reliable knowledge about the world, it&#x27;s up to you to provide the evidence, it&#x27;s not up to me to disprove any random evidence-free claim you make.<p>> I like the chair metaphor for this sort of talk. Sitting in a chair requires a measure of faith that it&#x27;ll hold my weight. If I&#x27;m sitting in the chair, the question is already answered so no more faith is required (unless I wanted to question the idea that the chair would continue to hold my weight!).<p>None of this requires any faith, if you want to figure out whether a chair will hold your weight, you(!) use evidence. Does it look like chairs that you have experience holding your weight (it&#x27;s the same model you have at home, maybe)? Does it look like chairs that you have experience not holding your weight (those rusty legs full of holes look just like that laundry rack of yours that fell apart yesterday, say)? Have you seen someone else sit on it? Does it stand in some context where there is an increased chance that it won&#x27;t hold you (a room in your company where meetings are being held all the time vs. a long-forgotten corner in the attic)? All of those checks and many more are how you(!) decide whether you will sit down on a chair or not, or whether you maybe carefully test whether it will hold you before you sit down. You don&#x27;t just sit down on any chair in the faith that it will hold you, and there very much are circumstances where you will refrain from sitting down based on the evidence you observe and your experience from previous observations as to what attributes tend to indicate a reliable chair and which indicate an unreliable chair. And still, you could be wrong, in which case you&#x27;ll figure it out by trying to sit down, not by postulating some truth &quot;on faith&quot;.<p>> If I couldn&#x27;t sit in the chair because it&#x27;s behind a glass wall in a museum, then I can choose to believe it will/won&#x27;t hold me or I can choose to not make a decision because, who cares? And for a chair that&#x27;s okay, because it&#x27;s not being prescriptive or dealing with anything existential.<p>You can&#x27;t choose belief. Belief is about whether you are convinced of the truth of some claim. Either you are convinced, or you are not. You cannot decide what you are convinced of. If you could decide your beliefs, you could decide, for example, to be convinced that jumping from a tall building is not dangerous. Once you believed that, you would jump out of the window of a skyscraper without any hesitation, just like you don&#x27;t hesitate when stepping out of the door at ground level because you believe that to not be dangerous. Could you do that?<p>I for one would probably withhold belief. Just as above, if it looks reasonably solid (aka reasonably similar to chairs that I have experience holding my weight and reasonably dissimilar from chairs I have experience not holding my weight), I might tend to believe it. But if you asked me to bet my house on it, I probably would refuse.<p>[...]",1449806626
10715370,comment,10700766,10714385,0,0,danharaj,,,"> Your syllogism equivocates on the concept &quot;observation&quot; and does not follow.<p>I was going more for an analogy than an equality. I also did not mean to imply that the relevant moral observations are how one derives moral principles. The relevant observations are the questions: &quot;I perceive situation X in reality. Is injustice present? Who has been aggrieved, and is there an aggressor?&quot;<p>These are clearly observer dependent.<p>> Moral discussions are not a &quot;game&quot; since lives and, ultimately, civilization hangs in the balance<p>I vacillated on using the word game. The game isn&#x27;t morality, but pondering what morality is. If I had called it a thought exercise I think it would have had slightly better connotations. I call processes of cognition games perhaps too often.<p>With respect to objectivity: Not even scientists attempt to achieve objectivity. They merely attempt to reach consensus. It can be a bitter and contentious process in even the most quantified sciences. For example, the disagreement over whether tetraquarks exist [1]. Objectivity is a naive concept. You cannot prove that your perception of objectivity is, well, objective. Objectivity is at best a useful fiction. It&#x27;s actually a very useful fiction! But it can fail because one&#x27;s understanding of objectivity cannot verify that it is objective.<p>I think you can imagine a kind of person who claims that others lack objectivity when they are disagreed with. They exist everywhere. There&#x27;s a named logical fallacy for this kind of behavior. Demanding one&#x27;s morality be objective does not make one&#x27;s morality objective, but it means that every moral judgment one makes is now self-judged to be objective. The moral framework can be internally consistent but inconsistent in its reification into material judgments and actions.<p>> Moreover, your position assumes two things that the radical Islamists do not share; the value of a human life (in the here-and-now not some fantasy world) and that reason, not guns, are the means for resolving disagreements among civilized men.<p>Ok, so we&#x27;re talking about &quot;radical Islamists&quot; now, so I&#x27;ll assume you mean Daesh because the vague &quot;radical Islam&quot; is just a snarl phrase. Is Saudi Arabia an example of radical Islam? They&#x27;re an ally to the United States. Notice how the countries that claim &quot;reason, not guns, are the means for resolving disagreements&quot; quite willingly and openly and readily act in direct contradiction of those ideals. There is a discrepancy between what people say morality is and what they do. Everyone loves their morality when it permits them to dominate others and shape the world the way they see fit. Everyone&#x27;s morality permits them to commit atrocities.<p>I am a moral realist. I merely make the claim that a person should not believe they have a direct apprehension of moral truth because such a belief compromises the ability to apprehend moral truth. Therefore I demand of a person&#x27;s moral framework that it be oriented towards analyzing and understanding differences between people&#x27;s moral judgments. If I assume I am capable of understanding moral reality and meet someone who disagrees with me, I can either conclude they are incapable of the same understanding or the disagreement stems from different vantage points.<p>Believing two moral individuals can come up with different moral judgments in the same situation is the only sensible starting point towards reconciling conflicts. Understanding why moral people can come to different moral conclusions is the fundamental mechanism of justice. Otherwise violently asserting one&#x27;s moral truth is the only mechanism.<p>> How do you deal with someone who not only doesn&#x27;t share your moral &quot;sentiments&quot; but wants to actually kill you? Is there some basis to compromise in this case? Why do we shoot lions and bears instead of trying to reason with them? Is it moral for you to kill a fly in your house? What if I disagree and claim all life is sacred and you have a moral duty to leave the bugs alone and I am willing to use my guns to protect them from you? On what grounds could you possible oppose someone like that if you really believe morality is relative (i.e. subjective)?<p>I think you&#x27;re missing the point. Just because science is supposed to be done via reproducing experiments and corroborating results between different scientists doesn&#x27;t mean that science is paralyzed by the existence of a person who believes in crank theories and cannot properly run experiments and thus cannot effectively communicate their scientific activities to other scientists. Likewise my morality isn&#x27;t paralyzed by hypothetical bug-zealots who act maximally unreasonably. If you believe the world is filled to the brim with brutish idiots with whom you cannot possibly communicate moral sentiments, well, I&#x27;ll have you know there are plenty of them that feel exactly the same about you. How are you different? Your internal moral framework is no proof to me that you have a correct moral understanding of anything.<p>Here&#x27;s a better example: You come across two kids at a playground. One sticks their tongue out at the other who then throws a punch and starts a fight.<p>30 seconds earlier, I saw the kid sticking their tongue out shove that other kid to the ground. Then I saw exactly what you saw.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure our moral judgments are going to be different.<p>The real world is vastly more complicated than this contrived example. When you come into moral conflict with other people you can either assume they&#x27;re a bunch of illogical, fact-spurning hate machines like the top-level comment in this thread[2], or you can believe that your difference in values and moral judgment of a situation arise from a difference in context which can be reconciled through communication and deliberation. If humans can&#x27;t practically know everything in order to come to an absolute moral judgment, human morality is functionally observer dependent. That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a moral reality that doesn&#x27;t care about the vagaries of human perception and social context, it&#x27;s just not practically accessible.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140827-quark-quartet-fuels-quantum-feud/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140827-quark-quartet-fuels-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_asymmetric_insight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_asymmetric_insight</a>",1449806625

With a capture limit (in this case 50%)<p>I built a simple spreadsheet for you [1] which can illustrate this. In the spreadsheet there are two scenarios, one the person &quot;pulls the trigger&quot; every time their investments have grown by the target amount, pull off the growth and take it out of the game, and then go back in with their basic investment. In the second scenario they just let it grow and grow and grow. After 5 rounds with a growth target of 50% they have $35K if they regularly pull the trigger, and $75K if they let it ride (more money is in play so the same percentage increase in the market gets you more money back). When the bubble bursts, if you lose all of the money in play, you end up with $25K and $0.<p>You can play with the spreadsheet and make some other choices to see how they work out. The smaller your trigger point the closer you get to having identical returns because you&#x27;re not getting any amplifying effect of the money allowed to grow, the larger the growth target the longer in time (generally) you have to wait before you can pull the trigger and like musical chairs find yourself losing out because you waited to long.<p>An interesting diversion is to run different investment strategies against the historical record from the bubble to see which left you with more money. If we are in another bubble that could be useful information.<p>Or not.

Psychologists study behavior, then come to unsupportable conclusions about the mental sources of that behavior. It is the second step that (a) distinguishes psychology from anthropology, and (b) prevents psychology from taking any claim on science.<p>In a nutshell, psychology studies the mind. The mind, not a physical organ, cannot provide empirical evidence, evidence gathered from reality in a way that forces agreement about its meaning between similarly equipped observers. Science requires empirical evidence. Therefore psychology is not a science.<p>> Some branches of psychology study the relationship between other empirical facts and people&#x27;s self-described experience of mental states, but both the other fact and the descriptions are empirical facts.<p>So which part of &quot;Psychology&#x27;s topic is the mind&quot; are you not getting?

Science, redefined, is no longer the empirical analysis of the natural world; instead, it is any topic that sprinkles a few numbers around. This is dangerous because, under such a loose definition, anything can qualify as science. And when anything qualifies as science, science can no longer claim to have a unique grasp on secular truth.&quot;<p>&quot;That&#x27;s why scientists dismiss psychologists.

6805451,comment,6805093,6805241,3,0,DigitalSea,,,"This sounds really good. I think the issue definitely needs more attention, because these kind of toxic environments are becoming the norm for the software and web development industries. I remember a conversation a manager had with me once because he felt I wasn&#x27;t putting in enough overtime (being salaried and not being paid for overtime, I felt this was wrong). His issue was that the other developer who I worked with, who had no girlfriend or wife or kids to spend time with was staying until 9/10pm every night of the week and he lived a 2 hour drive away whereas I lived 45 minutes away by train or 20 by car.<p>The problem is if you refuse to put in the overtime, there will always be someone else who is willing and able to put the overtime in, as a result they are presented with more opportunities. The mentality in every development industry is if you are the first to leave, you&#x27;ll most likely be the first on the chopping block if the business hits a rough spot. You are perceived as not being a team player, not working hard enough and putting pressure on your peers.<p>I understand overtime is part of the job. We as developers know when we signed up to be developers that there will be late nights, but when companies expect overtime as part of the normal job for no good reason other than to get more for less, that&#x27;s not right. People are afraid to leave at 5.30pm on the dot at most companies, especially as the economy gets worse.<p>Sadly I&#x27;m in Australia, otherwise catching up and discussing the state of the industry would have been awesome.

The problem is that most patents should never have been granted in the first place, because they are obvious or non-novel.<p>If you had to manufacture something before you could patent it, then your idea could be stolen by any potential investor. And some solutions you can&#x27;t manufacture without help from entrenched businesses. Robert Kearns shopped around an idea to GM and Ford for a new wiper system. They stole it without paying him. If patents couldn&#x27;t be held by NPEs, then the law would always be on GM and Ford&#x27;s side, because Kearns didn&#x27;t happen to own a massive automobile production line.<p>Why should owning a massive car factory be the only thing that qualifies you as an inventor?<p>Also, anyone who can beat you to market has a defense against your patent claim. The biggest, richest, fastest manufacturers win the right to produce everything they never invented.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the patent system is definitely broken. The way it&#x27;s broken happens to get exploited by certain non-practicing entities. But the problem isn&#x27;t NPEs, it&#x27;s _some_ NPEs, and really, it&#x27;s just the features of the system those NPEs are exploiting.<p>The problem with our patent system is that no one actually seems to care about novelty or obviousness, even though they are supposed to.<p>Consider &quot;a method for thermal refreshment of bread&quot; (patent number 6080436). It&#x27;s a toaster patented in the year 2000. David Martin, a patent quality assessor, claims that about 30% of the patents his firm reviews are for things that have already been invented.[1]<p>Software has it&#x27;s own special version of this problem. Juries can&#x27;t code, so they don&#x27;t have any clue what&#x27;s obvious, what&#x27;s just an incremental improvement that anyone could produce if they knew the language. Juries can&#x27;t tell the difference between design tweaks and brand new methods.<p>The problem is not that the system rewards intellectual effort, the problem is that the system rewards things that are effortless.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/transcript\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/t...</a>",1385511700

The road to production has a big no man&#x27;s land in the middle.<p>Second quote of the week in one week. ;-)<p>I make a couple of small electronic gadgets for my side business. My day job is also involved in electronic manufacturing, and I&#x27;ve had a good overview of what it involves.<p>Amusing anecdote: I was restocking a critical part, and noticed that one of the _alternate_ part numbers was on end-of-life status. I panicked and bought out my supplier&#x27;s entire inventory of my preferred part number.<p>That turned out to be the world&#x27;s remaining supply, and the part is now obsolete. I suppose at the end of the day, the lesson is that no matter how good you think your suppliers are about keeping you apprised of component lifetime issues, once in a while, you&#x27;re going to get screwed.<p>For being in the &quot;middle,&quot; it&#x27;s not just purchasing power, but that there are a lot of shady vendors out there. Any start-up that is headed towards that wilderness had better have an experienced buyer along. In fact, if you&#x27;re still working at a day job, any experience you can get in the trenches of supply chain management will probably benefit you.<p>It&#x27;s also worth considering what your design chain looks like, because it is intertwined with your supply chain. For instance, if you&#x27;re shopping your firmware work out, and your microchip goes obsolete, you&#x27;ll need to have a plan for responding quickly.

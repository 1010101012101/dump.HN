2135,comment,2055,2126,0,0,abstractbill,,,"""Ultimately the goal is to understand *all* your expenses completely at a central location.""<p>That's an excellent goal to have.  Full integration of bank and credit card accounts would definitely be important for me.<p>The following may be outside of the scope of your product, but I would love to have a system that knew my finances and goals so well that it could give me useful advice such as ""start buying product A, which you seem to use a lot of, in bulk from store B"", ""use the savings you have in account X to reduce the debt you have on credit card Y"", ""apply for this savings account that has a higher interest rate than the one you have now"", etc.  Such a system would have to understand things like credit cards that are zero-percent for a given period of time and so on.  It would probably also need to know my credit rating so that it could guess what credit card offers I could realistically apply for.<p>To make this a little more concrete, my fiancee and I have spent a lot of time recently trying to figure out how we should best combine our various debts and assets.  It's been very boring to be honest - lots of comparing interest rates that seems like it could be automated.<p>Good luck anyway!",1172991172

Though never mentioned, I can sort of see Google fitting the profile of an up-and-coming ""great company"" according to the author's definition (one that will beat the market over the long term).",1172990089

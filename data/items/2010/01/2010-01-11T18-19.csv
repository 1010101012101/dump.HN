Whether that computer exists at home or at a school/university, we can already likely assume (especially for the population of ""professional"" programmers, due to the lesser availability of this necessary resource in past decades and the length of time necessary to become a ""professional"") that the group we're talking about trends toward the higher income side of the population. That alone would make the group as a whole far more likely to have ever picked up a musical instrument in the first place, let alone to have received the countless hours of necessary instruction.<p>Additionally, I think we can all agree programmers are disproprotionally likely to be homebodies. If one spends a lot of time at home, one has more opportunities for practice.<p>Lastly, if one has the patience and determination necessary to learn enough programming to label oneself a programmer (especially a ""professional""), then one is more likely than the rest of the population to have the same patience and determination necessary to learn another skill which requires countless hours of disciplined study-- like music.",1263235475

If you run a single thread (without the event based approach), each request must wait for preceding requests to finish entirely before running.  That can be extremely bad for latency.  On the other end, say you run a thread per socket - that's not effective as the memory usage for reserving thread stack space will limit your maximum connection count.<p>Event programming is useful in that it effectively performs cooperative multitasking without the overhead of thread stack space.  Multiple requests can be running in parallel without fully blocking each other.  Within a single thread they do serialize, but only by the length of your callbacks.  If a request has to do I/O, it will queue up the operation and then yield so that other callbacks can run.

As you'd likely handle I/O differently in something like Haskell, versus python.  Anyway, I'm just curious Thanks.",1263233383

The companies with the most data seem to be the least willing to share it.  Although a bunch of the smaller developers shared lots of helpful data and great analysis.  We have a lot of interesting data from the last 9 months and 8 million downloads and are happy to share a lot of it with the community (there will be some proprietary stuff we can't share but will try to err on the side of sharing).<p>One of the things we are willing to share that most others don't seem to be is our download stats.  I have a couple ideas on analysis, like tying downloads to PR.  But I want to make sure any research we do is useful. So let us know what you would like to see and we will try to accommodate.",1263233363

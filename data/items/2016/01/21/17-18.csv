In the movie industry[1], just like with the start-up industry, we see these types of behaviors pop up when the company or the art stops being the object of the creators affections, but instead it&#x27;s the money or power. It&#x27;s the &quot;MBA&quot; attitude that gets railed against on HN, where the only reason these people participate is to cash out, or in some cases with people who are already rich, they want to feel like they&#x27;re important.<p>Now, these people are plenty smart. They usually have gotten great educations and whatnot, but they lack the drive to be motivated by a love of doing this great thing, rather than accumulating some money. Some of the greatest creations in tech were not motivated by money at all. When a great film maker goes to bed or on vacation, he&#x27;s sometimes kept awake with ideas on how to make a better film or pondering a new concept. He takes no real vacations, because he loves his art so much that he never even wants to escape it. The money-driven type doesn&#x27;t. When they go on vacation, they escape. And professionally, they tend take the easiest path to their destination. And the easiest path to cashing out is to look at how other people became successful, and make a small deviation from their path then copy or exploit rent seeking advantages or be unethical.<p>I think that&#x27;s where all these portmancos come from.

I find it strange that a community of logic and science oriented people can hold such a notion.</i><p><i>When communities were small, reputation was king.

This means that the main disadvantages of diesel over electric are sourcing fuel, more moving parts to maintain, and some exhaust issues. However, the US railroad network was essentially built out in the steam era, and steam locomotives have much more severe requirements for all of these problems. Going to diesel from steam was already a win.<p>The problems with electric trains is needing to supply and maintain catenaries, needing to source enough power, and needing to cope with highly variable electric demand (trains use much more power when they hit a steep incline). In the early 20th century, when railroads were replacing their steam locomotives, the rural electrification projects in the US just didn&#x27;t exist yet, which made electrification of mainline railroad track quite expensive. The few railroads that tried ended up bankrupting themselves in the process.<p>Another drawback of electrification that&#x27;s only obvious in hindsight is that installing catenaries makes enlarging the load gauge that much more costly--if the US had mostly electrified its freight track, it likely would have never developed double-stacked container trains (absent in much of Europe since the electrical catenaries provide insufficient clearance), a development which did much to revitalize the railroad industry.",1453398056

Nominal rates haven&#x27;t been touched for quite a while; politicians opted instead to just allow the loopholes and safe havens to continue lowering the effective rate, and corporations seemed to be happy about that.<p>The likely reason for corporations holding onto cash is the lesser impact deferrals can make in today&#x27;s markets. Companies are becoming larger and larger umbrellas every year, and as the need to hire new people presents itself, the unfortunate realization for them is that they must look to the bigger cities for their best talent. NYC, LA, SF, DC, etc., are the best places to acquire talent, and they are also home to some of the highest tax rates in the country.<p>This makes talent acquisition increasingly expensive, and that means less money that can go to the offshore safe havens that allow deferrals to be so lucrative for companies. So, companies hire as little as possible, and though corporate revenues are decreasing rapidly as a result, it&#x27;s better for them than having to face a rather unstable business environment in the US, where all your massive infrastructure and talent investments may be useless in just a few years&#x27; time.<p>I believe that the US is becoming increasingly unfriendly to businesses, and the lack of political cooperation in DC is showing executives just how true that reality is.

Typescript has a good ecosystem of tooling (try Typescript in Visual Studio Code, for instance).<p>As for API stability, it largely depends on the SPA Framework you want to try. Yes, the problem is that there are so many to choose from and some of them do wonky things like reimplement the old GUI message passing loops and call it progress.<p>If you want my biased opinions on SPA frameworks: These days I use CycleJS when I get the choice, as it is simple, gets out the way, and built on top of RxJS for true reactive programming. It&#x27;s simplicity provides a very small API overall and thus a considerable amount of stability for said API because of its smaller surface area. If you need something a bit more time tested with the broadest classic browser support, I think Durandal (Knockout-based) is a stable, well worn SPA framework. Having used Durandal in the past I admit that Aurelia, it&#x27;s successor, is likely to have a similar stability, as it matures.<p>TL;DR: The transpilers are good enough if you give them a shot.

This is one of the big unsolved problems in statistics and empiricism.[1] There is no general solution to this problem, and the practical solutions to this problem are all very particular to their field. The geneticists have certain ways for controlling for certain known problems; the neuro imagers have certain ways for controlling for certain known problems; same goes for ML, particle physics, economics, ect. I&#x27;m personally familiar with a few of these, and I know that they are very particular to their field and that they each have their own history (which is why I&#x27;m hesitant to present myself as an expert on statistic empiricism in the context of trans-neptunian planet hunting). And those histories (the ones I&#x27;m familiar with) are a parade of over confidence followed by the community establishing new things that need to be controlled for. The red flag in my mind isn&#x27;t that they are following the established rigor for trans-neptunian planet hunting (I&#x27;m sure that they are, because peer-review), or that they aren&#x27;t following a theoretically valid methodology (I&#x27;m sure that they are not, because it doesn&#x27;t exist).

As an exercise, I took the FreeBSD binaries for lirc, which I built from the FreeBSD port, ran the service and socket units through the conversion utilities in the nosh toolset, and (after selecting &quot;ideal&quot; mode and fixing a bug) the converted services successfully supervised the FreeBSD binary under the nosh service manager.  This was on <i>actual</i> FreeBSD: on PC-BSD version 10.2, specifically.  Even in a world where its maintainers provided only systemd ancillaries, lircd could be run on FreeBSD.<p>The bug was in the lircd units themselves that the lirc maintainers were wanting to switch to, ironically.  lircd is putting stuff in an ephemeral runtime directory /var/run/lirc , without either making the directory itself or declaring it with a RuntimeDirectory=lirc directive in the systemd service units.

Certainly, safety is a prerequisite to making it into adult society, but it seems like quite a lot of the stuff parents do to try to provide their child with &quot;the best, safest, environment that they are reasonably able to provide&quot; is counter to the main goal of raising good people.

The HTML loader is ~189K and the JS app is ~462K, and includes the entire runtime and UI layer, and a lot of the control/component library.  Both the HTML and JS are aggressively compressed/obfuscated by a compiler, and the coding is done in a statically-typed, OO/procedural language with RTTI and other nice things.  The UI was designed using a WYSIWYG designer with two-way tools (code-behind).<p>So, there <i>are</i> products/tools out there that will do something along the lines of what you want.  And the existing JS engines <i>are</i> very good in terms of performance, so all that developers like us need to do is some quick compilation to JS and we&#x27;re all set.<p>However, I do agree with you on two points:<p>1) JS, by itself, just isn&#x27;t structured enough for large-scale applications.<p>2) The push towards libraries and away from frameworks was misguided because JS, by itself, doesn&#x27;t have the means to allow for this approach to be successful.  Instead, what we have now is every single small library reproducing the same functionality over and over again.  Case in point:  I was looking at writing an external interface (tells our compiler how to type-check external JS code) to ChartJS this week (great little library), and started looking at the code.  80-90% of the &quot;common&quot; code in the library was code that was already present, in some form, in our UI/runtime layer, and that was around 70K right there.  Multiply this by the number of small libraries, and you end up with a <i>lot</i> of duplication of functionality that is, essentially, dead weight.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 10MB of dead weight, but it&#x27;s pretty significant.",1453396757

You forgot marketing and sales.<p>I mean, I didn&#x27;t really &quot;forget&quot; them so much as try to earn them in the &quot;honest&quot; way. I was paying for sponsorships and ads. I was trying to make partnerships. We had a social media presence that was growing and active. We stupidly believed Google&#x27;s recommendation that the best way to rank is to &quot;just write great content&quot;, so we did that without putting a huge amount of emphasis on &quot;link building&quot;.<p>Our competitor had a pre-existing network of spam sites that he used to post links to himself and get increased PageRank. He astroturfed Facebook and Twitter. He spammed niche forums until it didn&#x27;t matter that they were blocking him anymore because everyone who used them had been exposed to his copycat product (they deleted any post that mentioned us, even after we offered a commission on any sign ups; we basically just accepted that since it was their turf).<p>Those were all things that I <i>thought</i> were, at best, impolite.

If you&#x27;re going to be independent and not take outside investment, and CNN isn&#x27;t going to run a story on you on day 1, you have to undercut the other guy through the same guerilla spam tactics that he would use against you.

For example, I think an interesting future path for the Rumprun unikernel (which, I always stress, is <i>not</i> the same thing as a rump kernel) is running without the POSIX-y userspace interfaces.  In fact, that&#x27;s pretty much where I think e.g. Golang support for Rumprun should go, i.e. remove the userspace abstractions from the stack, since they, conceptually, do exactly nothing.  Parts of the implementation of Rumprun are wrong, because I didn&#x27;t previously see the importance of no-userspace, but I&#x27;m slowly converting those.  (ironically, Rumprun -- before the codebase was even called Rumprun -- started out as no-userspace, and then grew too much userspace ... but that&#x27;s really another story)<p>(edit added later so that we get credit going where it&#x27;s due: It occurred to me that it was Sebastian Wicki who was campaigning for the no-userspace mode last summer as part of his lowRISC project, and did the initial work to be able to again use Rumprun without &quot;userspace&quot;.  Apparently my memory of events goes only a few weeks back if I don&#x27;t think about things carefully ...)<p>Now, if I&#x27;m allowed to summarize rump kernels, I&#x27;d say the goal is to build a framework which incorporates enough of the past to allow things to work, but tries to be as flexible as possible so as to enable the future.  I&#x27;m a firm believer in &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as #1&quot;, which means you shouldn&#x27;t produce software components which work only in one type of tool, because it&#x27;s easy to foresee that right around the corner you&#x27;ll have to build components for the next tool.<p>p.s. &quot;Atti&quot;?

10946566,comment,10943378,10943378,0,0,chatmasta,,,"I love the thought behind this. The biggest threat to Uber is not Lyft or taxis or any competitors, but the emergence of a decentralized, p2p ridesharing platform. Ridesharing companies already call themselves &quot;p2p&quot; but that&#x27;s a farce. There is nothing p2p about a single $XXX billion corporation controlling millions of rides.<p>In the Uber/Driver relationship, it seems at first glance that Uber has all the power. But in fact, the drivers have far more leverage. A single driver can drive for multiple apps, and in fact a significant percentage of the drivers I meet are simultaneously using Uber and Lyft.<p>Currently drivers using multiple platforms are pretty much only using Uber and/or Lyft. There is no third competitor. But if one emerges, especially with superior driver incentives, drivers will use it, even before any riders are on the platform. Even if demand on a new app is sparse, drivers have no reason <i>not</i> to download it and run it on their phone alongside Uber and Lyft. In the meantime while they wait for supply to grow, they can just continue using Uber and Lyft. But if this &quot;third competitor&quot; offers far greater incentives than Uber and Lyft, then once it&#x27;s supply side achieves parity with its demand side, drivers will prefer it to Uber and Lyft.<p>So what does a &quot;third competitor&quot; look like to Uber or Lyft? It looks like a company (or something else!!) that gives 95% or more of revenue to its drivers, i.e. operates on minimal margins.<p>What are the requirements of a true p2p ridesharing platform?<p>--<p>- Bare minimum dependency on centralized third party resources<p>- Decentralized reputation and dispute resolution protocols<p>- Decentralized payment system, possibly involving an auction model<p>- Equilibrium of supply and demand<p>- Legal compliance without a dependency on a centralized market maker<p>--<p>No technological barrier exists to any of these requirements.<p>The most difficult aspect of a p2p ride sharing platform would be legal compliance. How do riders vet drivers, and how do drivers insure themselves? Perhaps the solution is a third party, uninvested in the ridesharing platform, that controls the reputation, dispute resolution, and insurance system. Asking the ridesharing platform to carry those responsibilities will only result in bloat and overhead costs that cut into the margins of drivers. Whereas if a third party manages legal compliance, drivers can price the cost of it into their own driving services, instead of the platform &quot;passing down&quot; the cost to drivers (and exaggerating its magnitude).<p>The second most difficult aspect would be bootstrapping supply and demand. The supply side is relatively easy, as long as the driver onboarding cost is low. The demand side is more difficult, because people <i>trust</i> Uber and Lyft. Building that trust in a decentralized system would not be easy, especially without legal compliance.<p>I challenge someone to create the Napster of ridesharing. No central servers allowed, mobile clients only, no financial overhead per transaction. The next step would be to create the trusted third party responsible for legal compliance.<p>A p2p platform that achieves supply/demand parity and solves the legal compliance problem will destroy Uber and Lyft, because the centralized costs of a p2p platform are zero. The drivers price their own services and have incentive to find the most economically efficient legal compliance. Therefore prices are lower than Uber and Lyft, so ultimately people will prefer p2p over centralized.<p>sidenote: I&#x27;m from the Portsmouth area.

10946538,comment,10928020,10928702,0,0,stepvhen,,,"All research has to start somewhere. And the space for video games is much larger than the one you describe. In 2003 Steel Battalion was released for Xbox, the controller for which had around 40 separate inputs. Or consider older Point and Click adventures; though the only physical interface was a mouse with a few buttons, it is required of the player to synthesize all the information given to them (conversations, items, recognition of clickable things), and act on all available stimuli in a (usually) logical manner, something that requires much more than ~5 inputs. For a modern game, you should look into Dwarf Fortress[1]. This game has no end state, no defined goal (other than survive), and you are given little real information about the dwarves themselves, other than what is gained through observation and inspection. The inputs for that game span the entire keyboard, and are in general more akin to old text-adventure games in terms of complexity. And it is a serious game. If I was better at it I would play much more often. But my FPS is dead by the time I reach 80 dwarves and the seiges begin.<p>My point is, video games are far more complex than what you propose, and are not always as well defined. There is ample room for experiment and research.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/</a>",1453395746

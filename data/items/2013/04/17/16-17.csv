5565540,comment,5564546,5565329,1,0,the_paul,,,"These are totally valid concerns. The average home internet upload cap, especially in the US, is not very generous. But the idea with Space Monkey is that most of your ongoing data access will be directly from your own device. If you're at home already, that will be especially fast. If not, it will be slower, but we're still able to watch movies in remote tests over a crappy home DSL uplink.<p>Other people's upload bandwidth only needs to come into play if your device isn't available: its hard drive breaks, it gets stolen, your house burns down, etc. In that case, yes, getting all of your data back probably will be slower than you want it to be, but you will get it all back.<p>Regarding redundancy, be assured that Space Monkey can provide much better numbers than RAID-6. We do assume that a decent percentage of devices will have poor network uptime, and we want your data to be available and redundant even in the face of that, even if the ""fancy algorithms"" take more processing power on the devices than we would need otherwise :).",1366217881

You're implying that I cannot find an example where inflation was almost 15% and interest rates were over 16% back in the 1980s. Fed interest rates were lowered after the 2008 crisis to limit deflation. Inflation did not cause low T-bill rates. In fact, logic would dictate that high inflation would increase Treasury rate expectations and the demand for inflation-protected TIPS.<p>The reason interest rates were low after Congress nearly defaulted on their debts is because federal bonds were considered a safer risk/reward than the markets. Wall Street trusted our treasury to pay its interest this last year more than they trusted blue chips to both hold their value and pay dividends with an unstable recovery.

Would you be disturbed because the guy who cleans the floor holds controversial views?\nAlso bear in mind that employees will leave and be replaced with new ones who may be very different people.<p>Once you get past a certain size of company you're never going to get people who don't disagree on some divisive issue, whether it be gay marriage, gun rights or abortion.

The excitement around this newer form of probabilistic programming comes from the fact that they really are programming languages.  Unlike BUGS, they inherit all the flexibility, composability, and encapsulation of the underlying language.

There needs to be a common speed for all cars because difference in speed is, I believe, the real cause of danger.<p>However, there is one common case where the speeding law seems unnecessary at best. I live in Texas. Florida is similar in that there can be large stretches of empty highway. When I travel outside the city there is often very little traffic and very open country. If I can see for a mile and I am the only one out there, why shouldn't I travel at the fastest speed I can manage safely? In the city speeding rarely pays off, what with traffic and traffic controls. On a trip of 200 miles (Austin to Dallas for example) the difference between an average speed of 60 m/hr and 90 m/hr is an hour of travel. It seems wrong that I should be limited in this situation because an 18-wheeler cannot handle more than 60 or 70 safely. Worse is when you have small towns that drop the speed limit to 55 or 45 for a tiny stretch of road when the road does not even go through the town. That kind of speed trap is what angers people, especially when you see an officer blow through with impunity.",1366217110

Most definitely ""serious""; we're talking 10 engineers for a year type of size.<p>> Backbone requires you to write a lot of boilerplate code, which I think is totally unnecessary. This is in my opinion a direct threat against developer productivity.<p>a lot of people parrot this but i think they're missing the point. Backbone doesn't require you write boilerplate; it requires you to handle dom manipulation yourself. if you do dom manipulation wrong there's a lot of boilerplate; or you can use one of many libraries that make this very easy. backbone isn't meant to be the only dependency, it's meant to play well with other dependencies. So some of our Backbone.Views use knockoutjs (with knockback.js) for HTML rendering, and other Backbone.Views use KendoUI widgets instead of raw HTML. Nowhere are we doing raw dom manipulation and our view hierarchies are logical, not too deep, and rendering is quite clean. Notably we are not using Marionette; the ""boilerplate"" Marionette tries to reduce, for us, is actual decision points that are essential complexity.<p>Flexibility in rendering implementation is very important as we're working with a very talented external graphic design firm to provide a clickable HTML prototype.

Large swaths of the country still operate on 1.5Mbit connections or less, with upload caps being more like 256Kb for those users. Due to the disparity in speeds we can assume most of our transfers from home users would be limited to relatively slow speeds, not to mention (supposedly) using idle bandwidth.<p>If you need your files, how long is it going to take to get them? Assuming something like 2.5Mbps down, and if there were five copies of your data transferred at 256Kbps, that's 160KBps. Downloading at that speed would take 77.6 days to download the entire archive.<p>Then there's redundancy to consider. Disk drives are limited in capacity. Currently 4TB drives are available, with 5TB by the end of the year. To give each customer 1TB of storage while still storing other customer data on the device, you have to decide first how redundant you want the data.<p>If you have a fancy algorithm you can store hundreds of clients' data on the device. Maybe they only have a couple small files, so they can be replicated in lots of places in a small amount of space. But eventually the files will grow in size, so you'll have to remove some redundant copies to make room for maximum capacity. Let's assume they use something like RAID-6, because RAID-5 is shitty for large capacity small arrays. Since we assume a 4TB hard drive, we can have N-2 storage, so for 4TB that's 2TB; make it N-3 storage and you can fit 1TB of user data and 3TB of random customer parity.<p>With maximum capacity use, if three replicated copies of your data go away, your data goes away. How likely is this to happen? This[1] article explains how as drives increase in capacity they aren't increasing in reliability, which results in faster unrecoverable errors. As time goes by it's more likely your data will be lost.<p>This is assuming your data is available. If their software engineers are smart they might develop an algorithm that can take into account actual used space and add or shrink the number of replications across the network based on availability. So even if you have used 1TB of data, as long as other people have extra free space, you can keep replicating copies of your data to more devices. Sounds good!<p>Let's say your data is replicated on five devices. One device holding your data fails and is sent in for repair. Another is taken offline because the owner's internet connection is taken offline by a storm. Yet another is available, but is on a very slow connection. Your data is now on two devices. Sounds fine.<p>In the event that your device is unavailable, you will be able to replicate your 1TB from the two people who hold parity copies of your data. How much data that is, and how long it takes to recover, and whether or not that transfer puts one of their devices over the limit for a URE, is subject several factors.<p>Of course, there's many more factors to consider here, and i'm not an expert in any of them. But before you trust your data to a $10-a-month service, ask yourself: How reliable is the drive, how fast is the connection, and how much do you really need your data?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/storage/why-raid-6-stops-working-in-2019/805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/storage/why-raid-6-stops-working-i...</a>",1366215766

If she's not around, I will sometimes use fork-in-left, knife-in-right, but I don't switch back and forth while eating.<p>I attribute that variability to the fact that I also usually have to actually try to do something, or at least imagine doing it, to keep track of which side is left and which side is right. When eating with my wife, I end up being consistent in which utensils I pick up with which hands because she provides the cue for me to mirror.<p>There are lots of physical skills in which I'm reasonably equally proficient with both hands just due to extensive practice (typing, throwing a frisbee, spinning staffs), but I'm much <i>better</i> at left-handed contact juggling.

Assuming you are reasonably healthy (namely, your liver and pancreas are functioning properly) your body will keep the amount of glucose in your blood around 80 to 110 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L for those of you not in the US). It does this in a variety of ways... You body can produce more insulin to shift the glucose into the cells, and some cells (mostly in the liver) can chain lots of glucose molecules together into a big 'storage' molecule called glycogen. If your blood sugar drops too low, your body will cut back on insulin production and start releasing glucose from your glycogen stores.<p>Another side effect of your blood sugar getting a little low is that you get hungry, and being hungry is distracting. It not that your body is _actually_ low on glucose... A normal healthy adult has plenty of glycogen stores, and long before those are depleted your body will start breaking down stored lipids into their component fatty acids, which your cells can metabolize just as effectively as glucose.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis</a>",1366215102

The existence of replicants is a pretty compelling demonstration of the flexibility it affords: any view can be marked as ""replicable"" and then copied onto the desktop or any other replicant target.<p>Now, because data is exchanged almost exclusively using BMessages and everything is C++, if you're using C++ it's highly modular. If your definition of modularity and simplicity implies Unix processes passing plain text between them using pipes, you probably won't find it all that inspiring. My knowledge is all vintage BeOS R4 so I don't know whether Haiku is more multilingual today; I'd guess probably so, but if not, that would be a detriment since I'm not overly fond of C++ and wouldn't consider it ""simple.""",1366214910

When you sell yourself as a client+server then you might have a difficult time attracting the attention of all those who have significant investment in a different back-end, be it Node, Rails, or whatever. But yes, I agree, Meteor looks awesome. It's also got a steep learning curve. And much like Ember or even--I would argue, Angular--it's difficult to see the ""magic"" right off the bat. And given how new Angular and Ember and Meteor are, there is still a dearth of tutorials, videos, and books to help new comers see the value and get started.<p>So I'm definitely keeping my eye on Meteor.<p>That said, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Ember have something similar?

Which.. is surely impossible, at least for a complete 'perfect' simulation. Right? Imperfections (and the limit of a simulation having to be simpler than its host) would infer a finite chain of simulations, which would <i>vastly</i> reduce the likelihood of us existing in a simulation.<p>Also if these wars (etc) exist, the simulation is going to be knocked offline at some point, destroying all descendant universes, shrinking the pool of possible existent universes much further still.<p>So (AFAICT) we have gone from it being almost a certainty we are part of a simulation (only one true universe from infinite similar simulations), to being very unlikely.<p>I may check out the culture series, but i'm not one for reading much fiction, sadly.. impatient internet world that has formed me and all.",1366214582

5565196,comment,5558895,5560151,1,0,brandonbica,,,"As somebody who currently lives in the Twin Cities I can vouch for both the upside and downside. So far this year the weather has been awful (we're about to get hit by a wintery mix for the next two days) but I think that's true for many places this year. The summers are shorter but beautiful. Spring and Autumn seem to be the shortest seasons. I personally love the Fall up here. Out-state weekends trips to the lakes are awesome as well.<p>When it comes to the cities themselves, just like anywhere else there are some spots that are better or more trendy than others. St. Paul is an older city but in a well maintained, charactery sort of way. Minneapolis is a small city, newer feeling, much cleaner than some of the bigger cities. Their are lots of small areas within each of the cities that are pretty popular. The suburbs are constantly being built out and are very convenient to the downtown areas.<p>There's a number of other great things about the area to help counterbalance the weather as well. The one thing that really gets me though is that NOBODY knows how to zipper-merge.",1366214555
5565195,comment,5562556,5565136,-1,0,lutusp,,,"> Those aren't examples of perfect stores of value.<p>In fact, they are. They meet the evolutionary requirement that brought them into being, meaning not too much, not too little. If more resources were expended, that species would be outcompeted by another species who expended just the right amount of time and energy. That's what makes them perfect -- they're ideally suited to the environment and its requirements.<p>> When you view currency for what it is--merely a proxy, the idea of currency that doesn't inflate is exposed for what it is--silly.<p>But a noninflationary currency doesn't undermine the paper money thesis, all it does is change the rules by which one maximizes utility. A steady-state economy, one in which the value of a loaf of bread doesn't change over time, alongside a paper money system in which the value of a dollar doesn't change over time, works much like this one, but with some small differences, like the fact that one can hoard currency without seeing its value erode.<p>If this were not true, people wouldn't invest in gold. Think about it.",1366214550
5565194,comment,5562556,5563736,1,0,leoedin,,,"I agree with the first point, but the second is fairly redundant. Bitcoin is a value transfer system much as the banks have value transfer systems in place between accounts. Chargeback on a credit card is implemented at a higher level, based on a system of trust between the card processors and banks. There's nothing stopping you implementing an escrow service on top bitcoin or a similar irreversible cryptocurrency which is functionally identical to the current credit card system. It requires users to trust you, but then so does the current credit card system.",1366214544

Here's his rant:<p>""Please note: this auction is being removed, due to finding out that Google Glass cannot be resold once obtained. Since I have not received anything other than confirmation from Google that I have been selected for the #ifihadglass contest, I was not given the terms of service agreement that those who received the first batch did indicating the device could not be resold. So, all of you who apparently have no life aside from posting in forums about this auction can sleep well tonight knowing that the glasses will not be sold. Thanks to Patrick Nugent (eBay user torwolv) and the many others who have driven up the price for their own amusement. #ifihadalife Sorry for being a recent college graduate that was hoping I could possibly resell my Google Glasses to help pay down my student debt. Yes, I am everything that's evil in the world. Anyway, nothing to see here anymore. Take a screen shot, it will last longer!""",1366214497

Right after 9/11 I was numb, but I didn't have a major response going back to our offices. My company at the time shut down not long after and I started working in midtown. It wasn't until the year anniversary that I decided to take a different route in to work, just to go by the proceedings down there - my emotional response was bad - I went to city hall park and sat there, reflecting for a good half hour before I could continue to work. I remember vividly an elderly woman coming and sitting next to me to make sure I was ok.<p>It takes time.

Like ""hard to imagine anyone working harder"".<p>However, if my experience working in (non-tech) companies in Tokyo has taught me anything, it's that people have to work so hard because of some startling inefficiencies (and some serious peer pressure) and a great resistance to integrating technology into the work flow (e.g. this is the first year I received internet in the office).<p>This sounds hard to believe as Japan has produced some amazing technological innovation, but there is a really strange mindset in the higher ups concerning digital conveniences, and they appear to be influencing protocol. For example, ATMs have working hours, and some are not available on weekends at all, and others have higher fees the later in the evening it is (and this is a cash dominate society).",1366214462

I haven&#x27;t publicly launched it yet (no traction :/) but I&#x27;m fairly certain there is a market for it and there are a few obvious paths to monetisation. The idea is novel, it&#x27;s a white market (no direct competition at the moment) and the barrier to entry is reasonably high (mostly due to technical complexity and potential network effect).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if in its current incarnation the idea could scale to become more than a &quot;lifestyle&quot; business but I have some ideas. I&#x27;ve been thinking about the possibility of getting a co-founder and funding lately. One problem I&#x27;m facing right now is that on one hand, I want to give my potential co-founder a large chunk of equity (30-50%) so that (s)he feels motivated but on the other hand, I&#x27;d feel a bit uncomfortable about just &quot;giving away&quot; a few months worth of labor and expenses. Having a co-founder who is willing to throw in a small investment would solve that problem.<p>If you think you might be interested, shoot me an email at seekingcofounder@tempmail.de",1423295993

For instance \nright now if you are an enterprise engineer with extensive perl or .Net experience this will hurt you if you want to get into a young web company. On the other hand if you are an iOS or Node engineer in SF or can position yourself as an engineering manager then you&#x27;re likely to find it easier to get job offers.<p>In general, the data that I&#x27;ve seen suggests that new companies are basically not interested in older technologies. I believe that the problem a lot of older engineers have is that they try to enter the current market by relying on their old skills and that mis-match is interpreted as ageism.<p>In my experience having experience (and age) is very valuable IF you&#x27;re a strong engineer and you can apply that experience to the existing technology landscape. Make sure that you&#x27;re presenting yourself to the right companies with skills in the right technologies and toolsets though or they will not even look at you.",1423295148

9013392,comment,9010894,9011347,0,0,e12e,,,"Agree with both you and GP. According to this blog post, they&#x27;re not solving the trust issue, they&#x27;re just working around the issue of a webmail app not being able to query keyservers:<p><pre><code>  > We couldn’t make cross origin requests to HKP\n  > servers from the web version of our app.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not entirely clear if the REST proxy for hkp they&#x27;ve created is open source -- if not it&#x27;s almost useless as far as I can see. <i>If</i> I were to trust my secret key to the browser/a browser &quot;app&quot;, I&#x27;d have to download the app from a web-server I trust <i>and control</i> (ie: my own server). And I&#x27;d certainly not want to load <i>anything</i> from any other server. I might trust a sanitizing REST proxy under my control to go and get gpg-keys.<p>Either way, while Trust-on-first-use is certainly pragmatic -- if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re going to do, then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with most email clients that have gpg-support -- most will do that gladly! One might argue that in addition to downloading keys, they should be signed as &quot;marginally trusted&quot; on first use (or maybe there should be another trust-level in gpg/pgp: &quot;TOFU&quot; -- to avoid anyone else mistakenly trusting the key).<p>I think semi-structured &quot;CAs&quot; for gpg would be a much better solution: allow banks/post offices/DMV to sign and upload a gpg-key -- demanding that such keys had an attached photo, and that the institution verified the ID/name at the time of signing (with the same level of trust that is usually demanded by institution that make valid IDs: a valid passport etc).<p>If I could go to the bank, and get a copy of <i>their</i> key, and sign that (and have them sign mine) -- and so have a good pathway to &quot;everyone&#x27;s&quot; key -- that&#x27;d be great. And unlike with browser CAs - <i>I</i> could chose who to trust to delegate IDs. As I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere I think cacert.org should also sign GPG-keys (just as a convenience -- you could of course sign your gpg-key with your CA-cert -- but that would require manual intervention to verify the chain of trust, unlike a signature by a trusted gpg-key).<p>As for the &quot;Snowden&quot; use-case -- TOFU is fine. Someone sends you signed and encrypted data, you can assume you&#x27;re talking to whoever has the key. Maybe you can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s not the FBI/CIA/NSA/GCHQ setting you up -- but does it really matter? You&#x27;ve already started a dialogue, and that&#x27;s probably enough to put you away for life...",1423294973
9013390,comment,9008472,9011056,0,0,kazinator,,,"You get Lisp or Fortran by adding discipline and using the stack language as a back end. Then instead of &quot;pop three things off the stack and put one back&quot;, that stuff is hidden and generated by the compiler, so (on the plus side) the stack pointer is never wrong. You don&#x27;t have to worry about: if I take this branch of the conditional, will the stack be left at a different height. Or worse: be tempted to exploit that somehow as a feature. The stack basically disappears from view. And then (on the minus side) you can&#x27;t do things any more like replace a function that pops three things, by a sequence of two functions where each pops two and puts one back. On the plus side again, because the stack has disappeared, you can really change how it is represented. Like pass and return in registers; aggressively inline functions, etc.",1423294945

Especially the young.<p>For example, the advice to start early on a pension is commonplace. But the young often have low disposable income, and this cuts in to other possible uses of money that have far more return on low amounts of capital.<p>For example, taking a few months out to study in a different field. Building up a relocation fund so that you can move to a higher paying area. Working towards a property deposit. Buying cars outright instead of borrowing money to finance them.<p>Most of those have a far better return than a few percent per annum. It&#x27;s just not clearly quantifiable.

As an approximation, they apply a silly DRM scheme that takes time to break, and ask customers if they are willing to pay for time-limited access.<p>Unlike with DRM on music downloads or (worse) physical copies of software or games, there&#x27;s no expectations mismatch here.

9013354,comment,9010390,9013150,0,0,e12e,,,"That is a very good question, and one that isn&#x27;t easy to answer succinctly!<p>Just by asking that question, you are on your way to better security. One key thing to understand is that security is a process -- it cannot be added on. Similar in that way to how &quot;high quality&quot; cannot be added (and high quality is often a prerequisite for security -- bugs (in sub-systems) are almost always bad for system security).<p>Another key is to see security as a trade-off between real threats and risks, and convenience[1].<p>For example, I don&#x27;t currently encrypt my email (with gpg, my smtp server speaks SSL/TLS to those that are willing) -- I use webmail from time to time -- which IMNHO cannot mix meaningfully with gpg and/or end-to-end encrypted email. I have a bootstrap issue with both gpg and OTR -- very few of those I communicate with use either. So I cannot use either.<p>This is another aspect, which I&#x27;ve seen little discussed: secure communication is all about the network effect (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been discussed, but <i>I</i> have not seen it discussed much). Facebook is actually a positive point here: Facebook chat supports[2] xmpp, which supports OTR (but not in the browser, messages that are encrypted are unreadable to Facebook, and via the web client). By having chatsecure on my phone, and many friends on FB -- I actually have a few I can communicate securely with, via XMPP+OTR.<p>That google killed/are killing XMPP access to their IM, is devastating with regards to the security of IM going through Hangouts.<p>Another important point, is that security is all about looking at the system, and realizing that the system, like the original MVC -- when it was MVCU: Model-View-Controller-User[3] -- includes <i>people</i>. People, unlike hw/sw tends to forget passwords, type passwords into the wrong input window[4] etc.<p>I remember reading one of the &quot;Rainbow books&quot;[R], I believe it was NSA Orange Book[5], or maybe[6] a long while back, and found it to have a lot of good points on making a secure system. Maybe someone else have some newer recommendations?<p>Again, it&#x27;s a complex question. You can&#x27;t be confident you&#x27;re communicating securely if you can&#x27;t be confident you&#x27;re using a secure system. Hence, Snowden, as seen in Citizienfour, tells the journalists to use an air-gapped (off-line) system for encryption and de-decryption. This is good advice, against most &quot;normal&quot; adversaries. But it is really hard to be paranoid &quot;enough&quot;. It is easy to back-door a modern device via it&#x27;s BIOS/boot-code/kernel, to install various key-loggers (in hardware or software) -- and most people don&#x27;t realize how absurdly easy it is to break into most houses undetected (see: bumpkeys, lockpicks).<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that one small aspect that needs work is helping people choose and use better passwords/pass-phrases -- as that is often the weakest part of a system. Sometimes that can be mitigated by using hardware tokens to store keys and delegate encryption to. I&#x27;m afraid there are no easy answers.<p>[1] Should be a link here to a sign posted outside a secure facility, I think a prison or jail, stating simply: &quot;Security is not a convenience&quot; -- but I couldn&#x27;t find it on-line. I believe someone used it in a talk on security a good while back...<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sitetour/chat.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/sitetour/chat.php</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://bash.org/?244321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bash.org/?244321</a><p>[R] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/std001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/std001.htm</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg017.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg017.htm</a>",1423293392

Even scripting languages like Python, Javascript or Ruby performs very well by spawning servers on each cores.<p>But if your performance requirements goes serious, I believe you will get unusual bottleneck (e.g. GC, VM, memory usage pattern, specific hardware,... ), then you&#x27;ll want a kind of &quot;full-control&quot;. In this case, the only traditional choice was C/C++, and that&#x27;s why many large-scale companies like Google and Facebook are using C++ internally.<p>Anyway C/C++ cannot provide enough level of safety that required to provide good productivity. As a workaround, you can use a sort of dynamic checkers (sanitisers), but the dynamic checkers are very immature, and fundamentally dynamic.<p>A new, and the only current alternative for this case is Rust. Rust provides far batter safety from first at &quot;compile time&quot;. It also provides far better linguistic constructs and semantics. But the language itself is immature.<p>Anyway, (1) there is huge demand for this kind of features from C++ community and (2) Rust is completely engineer community driven (3) and fully open-sourced.

9013346,comment,9012938,9013113,0,0,developer1,,,"The editor thing can be kind of important. People who stick with emacs or vim tend to be horrible with following coding standards and being able to review and navigate code efficiently. There&#x27;s nothing like an editor from Jetbrains for tooling (Eclipse works too, but seriously the Jetbrains line is the best).<p>I have never used emacs, but vim is horribly limited in what it can truly do in terms of handling code. You can add all the nifty little plugins you want, but it just isn&#x27;t efficient. The mistake people make moving to a full IDE is installing the vim plugin to add some familiarity. I&#x27;ve seen coworkers take literally <i>5 minutes</i> to hammer out the vim keystrokes to refactor a block of code that can be done in 15-30 seconds with 2-3 native IDE keyboard shortcuts and a mouse click or two. It&#x27;s important to know how to use vim or similar for remote command-line work. When developing though, the functionality and built-in tools provided by a full-fledged IDE are priceless.<p>There was a time I didn&#x27;t judge new developers for using vim to edit code - and a long time ago I was one of them. I used to see these people as &quot;true developers&quot; for mastering an editor like vim. Now, after years of encountering developers with hampered productivity and ability to work on a team with coding standards, I see a vim/emacs person as someone who is stuck in their ways, refusing to even try to modernize their workflow.<p>Just a random example: in PHP projects, my teams use CodeSniffer for coding standards validation. The settings for common IDEs are committed to the VCS so they are automatically in place for new developers cloning the project. In any modern IDE, notices/warnings are instantly and unobtrusively made available as you type code. You can also run the inspection against the entire codebase or files you have modified since last VCS update to catch anything you missed.<p>What do Vim users do? They write code for hours or days at a time without validating what they are writing. When done, they either a) commit without running their code against CodeSniffer while egotistically proclaiming that their personal coding style is clean and doesn&#x27;t need to match what the rest of the team abides by; or b) they spend hours running the command-line version manually, ridiculously trying to parse the output and hunt each problem down.<p>This is the real problem with vim/emacs users. Nearly none of them are capable of following the same coding practices as the rest of the team who are sharing a set of project settings in modern IDEs. The worst I&#x27;ve seen was a team that had once had amazing code quality completely abandon all forms of coding standards when two new senior developers were hired who both used vim. They refused to follow the standards because vim simply doesn&#x27;t contain the necessary tooling. The entire codebase went from being beautifully clean to a complete mess, all because the new guys used vim. That was the job I walked away from so fast after fighting over the ridiculousness and then learning that both new developers were basically hired for the simple reason they went to the same university as the hiring manager.<p>tldr; Use vim/emacs if you want; but if you&#x27;re not going to be as productive as, or match the code quality of, your teammates - that&#x27;s a problem.",1423293007

John Locke is the pseudonym of the author behind most of the 99 cent Kindle top 20 bestsellers, and probably one of the few that makes 6 figure sales this way.<p>I read the entire novel hoping that the ending would make up for everything, and in the end I just felt like that was a massive waste of my time and 99 cents. It was a mystery/thriller that ended up being so bad that I was laughing the whole time at the absurdity of everything going on. It was rather well edited, unlike most of the indie and 99 cent crowd, which was all it has going for it. And this book and many others have nearly the same rating by just as many customers as a traditionally published 1000 page behemoth like <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i>, which was (to me) worth every penny of the $15 ebook price and many, many hours spent reading.<p>I love seeing markets being revolutionized and people self-publishing easily, but the state of 99 cent ebooks today feels to me as bad as an iOS App Store with all 99 cent fart apps as bestsellers would feel. There isn't much quality or thought put into most of these, and the Angry Birds and Tiny Wings of the ebook world are few and far in between. I can only wait and hope to see improvement, instead of seeing more drivel being spewed out by the current set of bestselling 99 cent authors all celebrating their six figure sales of their godawful books.",1303120229

2458501,comment,2457953,2458325,5,0,bruce511,,,"The ""protection"" you speak of is that consumers can associate a producer with a product. In this case the producer of the original product was Sun which is now part of Oracle. Thus someone who gets an update for ""Open Office"" is getting it from the one true source for Open Office.<p>The freedoms provided by the Open-Source license allow someone to fork that code to create a ""new improved product"" - but that product can't be called ""Open Office"". In this way consumers can't think they're getting x and end up with y.<p>If the consumers are concerned about Open Office, then it's their choice to go to Libre Office. They are in effect opting-in to a change. Changes of this nature have to be opt-in, there's no way around that.<p>Allowing multiple people to use a trademark, or worse encouraging court battles over who is the ""one true heir"" to a trademark would not be in the consumers interest.<p>Clearly a fork can not have any claim on a product name because if it did there exists the possibility for infinite forks, and infinite products with the same name. This in no way serves the consumer, and specifically it does not facilitate the identification of the product, not does it serve to identify quality or other characteristics.",1303119402

<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Energy_density.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Energy_de...</a><p>shows that gasoline has both of these, along with good resistance to premature ignition, and other favourable ignition characteristics.  The solution will not be in finding something new, which is superior in every aspect to oil, but instead to be willing to sacrifice in some areas, (maybe volumetric energy density and total thermal efficiency,) in order to find an achievable solution.  Using a plentiful energy source (nuclear?) to perform hydrolysis, and distributing the hydrogen as a fuel seems like the most likely endgame to me, but the material properties of hydrogen are not favourable to storage and small scale use.",1303118969

2458475,comment,2458194,2458194,103,0,nikcub,,,"Some info on this guy to make the story clearer. He started an 'e-wallet' company specifically to cater to US poker players, who needed to use this style of online processor to get around having their transactions marked as being for gambling.<p>Intabill became popular quickly because of its low transaction fees. Tzvetkoff instantly became one of Australia's richest young men - purchasing a $25M home etc. etc. You may wonder how he became so rich so quickly from a company in a competitive industry - and it was because he was skimming money from the business and was not honoring withdrawls.<p>Full Tilt and Pokerstars finally stopped accepting Intabill and Tzvetkoff made off with the remainder of the deposits - which the poker companies had to cover players for.<p>When he visited the USA last year for a gambling conference in Vegas, Full Tilt and Pokerstars, ironically, tipped off his presence in the country to the FBI, who arrested him. He was surprisingly granted bail, and we now know why - he turned states witness in the case against the poker companies.<p>To the DOJ the online poker companies were bigger fish to catch rather than the guy who stole hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>And now:<p>> [accepting payments for poker] which has been illegal in the US since 2006<p>UIGEA was a rider on the Safe Ports Act of 2006[1], which means that it was never debated directly and was never voted on or approved directly. It did no come into effect until years after passing (the DOJ keeps quoting that the sites have been breaking the law since 2006, somehow not knowing that the law wasn't enforced until much later). The poker players association along with representatives who were working to overturn UIGEA, such as Barney Frank, worked tirelessly to continuously postpone enforcement of the act.<p>Frank was close to getting a bill passed last December that would have excluded online poker from UIGEA, Washington DC made it legal last week and a number of other states such as Nevada were about to do the same.<p>With it looking like online poker was about to be exclusively excluded from UIGEA, the DOJ knew that they had to act on their case now.<p>Most players have known for some time that there was a Grand Jury investigating the poker sites. It is known that a former member of Team Full Tilt, Clonie Gowen, testified against the company to the grand jury as part of a legal dispute she had with Full Tilt over compensation.<p>The poker sites relied on legal opinion which advised them that online poker is not considered 'online gambling'. Full Tilt went to the extreme of bringing in five separate firms to each give an opinion - and each found in favor of online poker not being online gambling. UIGEA makes specific mention of online gambling, but not poker specifically. The US Supreme Court and various higher courts have previously found that poker is a game of skill, as part of legal efforts by various states to legalize card rooms (see case law from the American Bar association[2])<p>The banks wouldn't take that risk though. They effectively shut out online poker transactions by not approving the poker sites as merchants. This didn't happen overnight - for eg. Citibank were one of the last to shut out online poker as late as a year ago.<p>Because there was effective collusion between the banks to lock online poker out of the market under vague threats from the DOJ - the poker sites had to work around it themselves by improvising and masking the transaction purposes by setting up their own banks and merchant accounts.<p>You have to ask yourself if this is fair - there are millions of online poker players in the USA, tens of thousands of whom play poker as a full time profession and make a living from it. The banks, with no direct law barring them from accepting the transactions, were persuaded by various lobby groups and the DOJ to lock the poker sites out of the market.<p>Some believe that what the banks did may have broken various WTO and free trade laws, not to mention the Sherman Act.<p>It is now apparent that in an effort to get around being blocked by the banks some of the sites and operators may have overstepped other laws such as money laundering, with new PATRIOT Act provisions - where you break the law even if you are the head of the company that is masking transactions in some way even if you were not directly involved or didn't know about it.<p>Online poker was weeks away from being legitimized in the USA. Pokerstars had weeks ago signed a new partnership agreement with the Wynn casino group. Full Tilt had struck similar partnerships. The Democrats were working to explicitly allow online poker transactions so that UIGEA would not have to be tested with online poker. Various states were working to legalize transactions for online poker. There is a strong chance that within a year or so online poker will be a legitimate, no-question-marks, fully transparent, billion-dollar online business.<p>When the DOJ dropped their case on Friday, Wynn announced that they had cancelled their partnership with Pokerstars and other companies/groups did the same with Full Tile and UB. All the effort from the players lobby, the companies themselves, the reps, etc. was blown up. Forget innocent until proven guilty, we are months away from any trial, only 3 of the 12 defendants are even in custody, yet domains have been seized and businesses destroyed by an 11-point case filing, of which only 2 or 3 points may ever get to trial<p>If the site owners are found guilty, they could be facing decades in jail. Penalties for money laundering that were increased as a way to lock up leaders of drug cartels and terrorist groups are being applied to people who built successful legitimate companies and had to work around all US banks being sacred of the vagueness of a law that was never directly enacted.<p>So even if online poker is found not to apply as 'online gambling' it will be too late for these entrepreneurs, who had to find their own way to work in the vacuum of nobody really knowing what was legal or not. The DOJ had a hell of a way of telling them that they didn't think it was.<p>A lot of people here on HN are entrepreneurs, so I hope you would support online poker entrepreneurs by lobbying your local reps, etc. Imagine if the industry you were in was being manipulated and artificially barred from trading by a small minority of those in positions of power. An industry which in this case is one of the largest and most popular passtimes in the USA. to me this is all sheer madness<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFE_Port_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFE_Port_Act</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/committees/CL430000pub/newsletter/200905/humphrey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/committees/CL430000pub/ne...</a>",1303118647

793802,comment,793691,793754,0,0,dlytle,,,"In regards to your race statement, I agree with your intent, but it's not really race; it's about social and cultural perceptions of race.  Thirty years ago things were very different for inter-racial families than they are now, and that varies fairly widely based on area.  If they don't include the areas in which the subjects lived, their dataset is critically flawed.<p>My sister and I are both adopted, and she was adopted from Korea at around 6 months.  She was an honor student every year she was in high school in Maryland, and she was just one of the girls; she was never treated any differently than anyone else because of her race.  (At least, not that any of us noticed.)<p>We moved to Colorado, and her school performance took a hit.  This was partially due to her being one of the only asians in her school, and standing out because of it.  A wonderful example is how a pair of her peers bought her a bag of rice for her birthday.  (I wish I was joking.)  The social effects of her race impacted her school performance.<p>In my case, I've found out that my birth brothers aren't as successful or as educated as I've been.  All three of us have ADHD, and all the problems that come with it, so it's not just biology.<p>In my (very biased) experience, we start out with a baseline derived from our genetics; our chemical imbalances and natural aptitudes.  The positives and negatives of those are modified from the baseline by our upbringing, parents, and education.  Then our social experiences shift that even further in one way or another.<p>Anyway, this study is useless on its own.  If they did a comparison against Korean families adopting Koreans, and compared that to white families adopting whites, they'd have something useful.  They MIGHT be able to successfully identify how much of the difference is related to adoption, and how much is related to race.<p>As is, it's an interesting but worthless data point.",1251589278

Adopted kids very rarely get any trustfunds. The test kids are in their 20s and 30s and usually at that age trustfunds and inheritances are contributed by people other than the parents (grandparents aunts uncles, etc.) and those people did not adopt the kids and usually do not have that much involvement with them.<p>Furthermore, people that live large inheritances to their kids tend to be of the selfish gene type and those people rarely adopt. Rich people that do adopt tend to spread the wealth more to charities, etc. and do not give kids (whether adopted or not) huge inheritances. Large inheritances are rare but only a few of them could scew the data a lot.<p>Similarly nepotism goes a long with gene selfishness. And will have similar effects to inheritances.",1251588470

Just the ones I can think of off the top of my head<p>- Race plays a part.  This study was done with Korean Infants adopted around 30 years ago when race played a much greater role in success<p>- Age at adoption plays a part.  If there’s one thing that gets hammered into American parents it’s that nutrition during the infant years has an impact on a child’s life.  If someone is, for example, malnourished during their infant years there can be severe physical and neurological consequences.<p>- Genetics certainly play a part.  Let’s be realistic here, Intelligence is at least part genetic.  I got As in High School without even trying while friends with more affluent parents struggled.  Is there really anyone who doesn’t believe intelligence is at least partially genetic?<p>There are probably tons more if I spent some time thinking on it.  Bottom line: The study proves nothing.  Moreover I suspect the question of whether adopted kids can be as successful as biological ones is far too vast to really have a definitive answer.",1251586974

Some text editors are of the UNIX nature, and some are not.<p>But, the fact is that you probably <i>shouldn't</i> be writing a text editor today.  Editing text is a solved problem, and you'll almost certainly do it worse than emacs or vim if you try.<p><i>The rule ""Store data in flat text files"" means you can't write a (reasonable) MP3 player or video editing program.</i><p>Sure you can.  Your playlists can be flat text.  Your video queue list can be flat text.  Your preferences can be flat text.  MP3s and video can also be processed in a filter style (and often are conceptually so within the UI).  Only problem is compressed data isn't in a form that can be filtered without first decompressing it.  But, I regularly batch process music and audio files.  If I did a lot of video work, I'm sure I'd also do the same with video.<p>Your program can certainly be a filter for those types of files.  Sox, lame, and the ImageMagick convert utility are good examples of media programs that embrace the UNIX philosophy.<p>The point is that you shouldn't use a database if you don't need the things that databases provide beyond storage of blobs of data.  Don't over-architect your file formats, don't obfuscate them, don't make it harder for users to use your code in ways you didn't envision.  This is the UNIX philosophy...not that you aren't allowed to operate on non-text data.<p>Programs have been working with messy real world problems since before UNIX and the UNIX philosophy existed.  The need to interact with non-text data hasn't sprung into existence in the past ten years.  Before there were MP3 and video, there was typesetting, and scientific data analysis, and moon landing calculations, and neural networks, and telephone switching, and so on and so forth.<p>Programming in the UNIX philosophy is always possible, and, as far as I can see from my many years of software development, always wise.<p><i>but most of these rules are just good guidelines for writing command shells and compilers -- not coincidentally, two of the main concerns of early Unix developers</i><p>Every single problem of note that I can think of would be well-served by breaking it into reusable pieces.  Sometimes this just means libraries, rather than small standalone programs, particularly on the desktop...but sometimes separate programs that happen to be used by a ""main"" program are the right way to go.  Things like video and audio compression can be, and often are, performed by separate programs.<p>This separation is a win on many levels...on a multi-core machine, the new process can have its own resources, while you continue to work away on your media.  It can be upgraded or maintained at a specific version more readily.  It can be used by other programs or in a batch mode from a script or batch compression utility.<p>I think it takes someone who doesn't use UNIX on a regular basis (actually uses UNIX; not merely a GUI shell on top) to think these concepts are outdated and not generally applicable.",1251586949

If you were to do it, it would be an organizational mess when looking for something.<p>/Developer is the standard install path. Documentation/ for docs, DocSets for the actual docs (as opposed to sample code), com.apple.ADC_Reference_library to say its an ADC reference library (as opposed to installing your own docsets, which some libraries have), CoreReference.docset to say which docset it is exactly (leopard vs snow leopard, for example), Contents/ is pretty standard for OS X bundles, Resources/ since docs are technically resources, Documents/ (again, there are other files here: sample code, tech notes, etc), documentation/ for the documents themselves, Cocoa/ for which framework you're looking at (It could also be Carbon, Webkit's CSS, Darwin, Java, etc), and, well, thats the end of the chain on my system. But to continue it based on a guess, Reference/, possibly redundant, but its nice for organizational purposes, ApplicationKit/ - you <i>are</i> looking up something in AppKit, but there are other *Kit's that can be used as well, Classes/ instead of headers, maybe, and then NSApplication_Class for the class that you want.",1251586816

129634,comment,129154,129434,0,0,NSX2,,,"Well I do recall something to the effect of not being so quick to drop out of school / quit work and starting a startup without giving thought to the overall state of the economy because it was being artificially propped up by various methods.  Now the economy's screwed up for, apparently, precisely that.  I don't know how you define trolling or whackjob, but I think that was just common sense.  People can't be whackjobs if they make unpopular predictions that wind up coming true.",1204717094

Not to mention all the free food, traveling expenses, etc.<p>It's cool they're doing it, but it's been done before and it didn't really work out the first time around so I'm not holding my breath expecting success this time around.<p>Mod me down if you want, but that was a big thing back in the day and how you picked which agency you went to work for.",1204717051
129632,comment,129459,129459,0,0,Remmy,,,"I have issues with Ubuntu. When I switched to a Unix based environment 12 years ago, I did what was expected of anyone at that time. I read up and learned about my environment. It seems that users (end users that is) simply do not think that these things should be their concern. That Linux should just do everything out of the box. While I am all for the simplification of Linux for the masses, understanding that software patents, copyrights, and intellectual property (in the US mind you) is being infringed upon by following guides like these is important.<p>Ubuntu is basically encouraging such acts by offering these ""solutions"" in their repositories. There are commercial solutions that could be explored which would provide legal solutions. I understand that they are trying to ""grow their brand"", but it seems a rather unethical way to do it.",1204716919

If you're happy you might make a 'happier' product, be more likely to succeed with business partners, more charming to angels and VC's, more friendly with your friends and even a better lover with your lover.<p>Each person only has so much to give.. you can squeeze a lot at the beginning and loose later or take a steady pace and reach the goal with a lot less stress.",1204716340

It might not work out but you're fortunate to live in the western civilization (I'm assuming) so you won't starve if things go wrong and it's likely that you can always get another programming job. I think you have a duty to yourself to try this out. Just imagine what you'll wish you would have done in 30 - 40 years time.",1204715761

This article seems to deal with getting hired at a company whose main line of business is not technology (say finance, which Dominic seems to recruit for). In that case, your employer will not care about your beautiful C++ code or super-efficient way to do X -- unless you can tie it back to the company's main line of business and making money for the firm. An internal squabble about the more correct way to do X will mean nothing to the non-technical upper management in a non-tech firm. Non-tech firms don't care about technology for the sake of technology because they don't sell technology -- the firm has other priorities and IT is just a side show to help get the firm's mission done.",1332370762

It would be like me, as a man, going on and on about how unfair it is that I'm expected to hide fear and put the safety of females before my own. Of course, we're well along the way to destroying that tradition. People ignore the myriad of subtle advantages to this ""sexist"" approach, starting with the fact that in an emergency no thought needs to be exercised - men know reflexively that they are to put themselves between danger and other people.

3737216,comment,3736037,3736912,68,0,drhayes9,,,"> Why do women wear low-cut dresses if not to attract male attention (in the majority of cases)?<p>Yes, Virginia, this is sexist. Holy hell, is it sexist.<p>You are characterizing a woman's behavior in terms of how it makes you, as a man, feel. There are many reasons that a human might dress a particular way, but by characterizing it as a gender-based, ""she wore that to make me do this"" kind of transaction you have incorrectly emphasized a single way. This woman wore it for no other reason than to attract male attention? Really? Are you sure? Her decision is entirely based on how it would make a man feel?<p>I'm a heterosexual man and I wear certain jeans because I like to show off my butt. That's fine. But am I doing it because I want to attract ""female attention""? Not exactly. This turns on a subtle point, but it's very important: I wore them for me, not for anyone else. Feeling attractive is not the same as receiving attention. I don't want to be honked at, felt up, leered at, or <i>even commented on</i>. But I do want to look good. Does that make sense?<p>This situation is only exacerbated when you bring in gender dynamics: men and women are equal, yes, but women are the ones who've been oppressed for centuries and are struggling up the slope to reach equality. What a man says to a woman exists within this context, so simply reversing the roles and pointing out that it's okay HERE but not THERE is not sufficient.<p>Check out: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze</a> The section about feminism and the male gaze applies here, too.",1332370394

In the design of an experiment like that, you'd want to use metrics that are heavily dependent on the change.  Measuring financial outcomes is no good, because they are affected in significant ways by a number of other factors (including a large factor of luck).<p>A better metric for this kind of research could be stress levels because they are significantly dependent on changes in physical working environments.  Stress is affected by a number of other work factors, such as management, work/life balance and workload, but these can be measured and controlled for.  The effects of stress on various performance outcomes are fairly well understood, so this relationship can be used in tandem with other variables to ensure that a change is having the hypothesized effect.

Crazy article.<p>Not sure if the Woz/Jobs intro is exactly apt; hindsight tells us that while Woz may have been disenchanted (and that as a true uber ultimate hacker, he probably stumbled upon this decades earlier and significantly harder than most hackers), it probably did have a bit more to do with the crazy personalities going on there Jobs' insanely focused and hurtful drive and Woz's desire to not be involved with the business of Apple.<p>Rather, I think the article hits the nail on the head in its conclusion:<p>""There will always be hackers. We may soon see genetic hackers, organic computing hackers . . . who knows? Theyre the ones on the fringes who push things a little further and faster. But their role in personal computing has been forever changed. Now that its big business, they may be happy at that.""<p>Their role changed because computing changed the world and indeed became even bigger business. Simulatneously, the ""creative force"" left the room, replaced with big business and other processes that are entirely disinteresting for a true hacker.<p>Now clearly the hacker spirit will endure as long as there are ways to push things that little bit further/faster. Often times, those improvements are valuable contributions to be spread, and the hacker spirit meets (in some way) with the entrepreneurial spirit.  This is beneficial and has led to some of the world's greatest success stories.<p>But the hacker spirit and the entrepreneurial spirit do have differences; different goals, priorities and countless other subtleties of art that the non-hacker might miss. Often times, as businesses grow, that's exactly what take place.<p>I definitely can't claim to have the answer, and no one's probably that much closer to the solution than when the article was written. But it's best to keep an eye out for the problem and steer clear of it at all possible.<p>In the meantime, I wish that those in the startup community would avoid trivializing the term ""hack"" left and right, omitting the creative force in the process. Analyzing customer traction and marketing data isn't hacking. Writing a few lines of code for your run of the mill social networking or daily deals startup one afternoon isn't hacking. This isn't to say that those things aren't important. Quite the contrary; teams and structure and 85% of startup events? Beneficial, but not hacking.<p>This isn't about making hacking elitist or limited to any technical context; rather, it's about flashes of brilliance and the gem that emerges. Just like it was in 1986. Just like it's always been and always will be.",1332368664

Nolan himself has said in media interviews that the significance of the top is that Cobb walks away. He's also remarked on the centrality of creation imagery in the film and explicitly stated that ""there's a relationship between the sand castle the kids are building on the beach in the beginning of the film and the buildings literally being eaten away by the subconscious and falling into the sea."" Funny how he even specified the <i>beginning of the film</i> in that quote. No-one is post-rationalizing those words into his mouth.<p>Frankly, there's tremendous power to any interpretation that leads one independently to the same conclusions the director later makes, all the while explaining away what are inconsistencies under other readings (why Mal is bad, why the continual biblical references, why there is so much damn water in the dreams, etc. etc. etc.).

Many frequently used words -- like connectors or adverbs -- are unlikely to be used as passwords.

349953,comment,349777,349777,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"I just don't see advertising revenue scaling and sustaining Fb. They need to generate hard cash, probably something along the lines of a subscription-based. Perhaps they should consider making Fb apps relevant again, except structured in a way that generates significant revenue similar to the AppStore. But I still don't see this sufficing.<p>Promotional leverage aside, the freemium model seems to frequently drown in a big hole of gluttony. And the point at which you try and change your model, often creates negative backlash from unappreciative consumers.<p>Certainly in retrospect it's easy to point out Fb's faults... but I feel like they should have limited free accounts unless you were a subscriber. Only paid members can create groups, pages, etc... but free members can join as many as they'd like. The social benefits still remain in tack, Fb is compensated for all this data storage, and helps curb pollution in the Fb community.",1225462945

It's growing slowly, but I'm fine with it. What I'm worried about is - how to control spammers by not submitting irrelevant stories on my site.<p>Adding CAPTCHA is one option, but then I was wondering, YC News also doesn't have any CAPTCHA protection. Then how come spammers don't submit advertisement based non-relevant news to YC News?<p>Does YC News algorithm detects such kind of links?  Or is there any manual intervention? Or it's just that the community is so good that nobody attacks it.<p>In anyway, your input about how can tackle this situation will be very helpful. Currently I manually go and delete all those irrelevant submissions (Daily there are atleast 5-10 such submissions.)<p>-Aditya",1225462320

Charging money cuts down on the number of users and lowers the value of the network.

Service interruptions and downtime with infrastructure like this should definitely be accounted for by a measure of reliability for Gmail since the end-user needs all of it to work to use the app.<p>One solution could be factoring in some sort of availability monitor at the border of Google's networks that polls/uses the Gmail service like an end-user.",1225462118

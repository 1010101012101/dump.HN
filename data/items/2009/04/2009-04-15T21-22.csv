The spread of scripts and literacy is instructive: there are more pre-movable-type-printing era writings extant in literary Chinese than in all other world languages combined, by a huge margin. And Japanese and Korean (and formerly Vietnamese) have long used Chinese written characters even after developing indigenous alphabets or syllabaries for what are languages that aren't even cognate with Chinese. Many other cultural influences have spread outward from China to a recognizable cultural area known as east Asia, just as different influences spread from Greece and Rome to an area known as Europe.

564193,comment,564032,564032,0,0,philwelch,,,"I'd go so far as to say that the command line is with us now more than it was 10 years ago. Google is essentially a command line for the web. Spotlight (as well as third party Mac utilities like Quicksilver and LaunchBar) are command-lines for launching programs, which satisfies a primary function of the original command line. As long as we have usable keyboards we'll have command lines one way or the other. (Phones, even iPhones, are an example of unusable keyboards by this standard. An iPhone command line would be less usable than the standard interface for launching apps, for instance, while on my Mac, Spotlight is more usable than the Finder.)<p>I don't like the attitude that keyboards are some outdated relic. Keyboards are the most efficient human-thought-to-language medium ever invented. On even the most simple Notepad/Pico/TextEdit style text editor, I can go from thoughts in my brain to written language faster than a pen, and almost as fast as my mouth can go from thoughts to spoken language. And with far more accuracy than either alternative. If the keyboard is ever replaced, it'll be replaced by something even more arcane and unnatural.<p>Doing away with hierarchical file systems is easier than he lets on. In fact, Gmail has already done this in our mail client. The solution is, instead of having a single static directory structure, you dynamically generate views of your files based upon search queries and user-added tags or categories. He mentioned Spotlight as another example of this, and he's mostly right (now that you can save ""smart folders"").<p>But sometimes human categorization is still going to be needed to keep related files together. In the past we did this by making directories. These days, ""tags"" or ""labels"" are more popular. But we might want to make hierarchies of tags, at which point you have a hierarchical file system again. There's one advantage—tags allegedly allow you to have the same file under multiple tags—but that's nothing more than hardlinks, and ""there should be a better UI for hardlinks"" would make a very boring essay. Then again, if we reverse engineer this thinking and refer to ""tags"" as nothing more but ""a better UI for hardlinks"", we just might have a good idea for a new filesystem UI.<p>(It also occurs to me that hardlinks are one-way links: each hardlink knows where its inode is, but the inode doesn't know where all the hardlinks are. A tagging UI is going to have to cross this chasm somehow.)",1239830680

Here in the UK it's a massive and <i>very</i> serious deal if you don't pay your income taxes (to the point of people wrongly accused of not paying taxes being <i>declared bankrupt</i> within months and losing their homes, etc.)<p>Short lesson is, never, never, <i>never</i> dick with the tax man if you're a British tax payer.",1239829663

It was truly and eye-opener; there are people in the research community holding their breath for this guy!<p>That said, the SciAm article says nothing new and does not do anything to defend against infopractical's criticisms. It presumes that Tammet is the man he claims to be; it's still a mystery! Although for a person who is supposedly Kim-Peek-level in terms of memory, he is using the term ""antisocial"" incorrectly (he means ""nonsocial,"" although this error is as common as the public's misuse of ""hack"").<p>The hyperconnectivity stuff is simply an extension of spread activation. Under this framework, everything he says in that article is obvious.<p>Finally, somewhat irrelevant to infopractical (which is still the most curious issue here), Tammet's objection to IQ is valid, but stated exceedingly weakly. ""This sounds a lot to me like astrology, which lumps everyone into one of 12 signs of the zodiac."": that's exactly what it does, and what it was designed to do, but that doesn't amount to a reason against it. The problem is the faulty inference that IQ translates directly to a discrete measurement of intelligence.",1239829654

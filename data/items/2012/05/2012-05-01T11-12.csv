There is a yawning gap going from simple key-value to the relatively rich constraints and transaction processing SQL standardizes that is probably not necessary, and I think will be addressed with more programming (rich constraints and data models <i>can</i> exist over a smaller amount of data without trouble).  Consider Cassanda column families vs. simple binary-string-to-binary-string systems, and it's already a significant advancement.  I think that's the direction growth is going to take.<p>Most of these large -- and particularly, global -- systems you speak of are eventually consistent also; they use the relational database as a potent backend member of a distributed system, able to check and deal with a great many constraint problems that can be localized.",1335873427

Having universal healthcare raises the baseline above which private health companies have to be, in order to compete. And sure, government healthcare sucks. Sometimes the doctor doesn't even smile at me when I see him. Their equipment is frequently not the absolute latest possible.

It provides no validation, only supports a limited number of types of data you can retrieve, etc. Similarly, getopt vs optparse vs argparse is a mess. getopt is universal: not only is it going to be in all versions of Python, but it is also the same library available in virtually every other language. The problem with it is that it is not declarative, so you will typically see a giant if/elif statement that goes with it. argparse/optparse are better, but aren't universal even between versions of Python, though argparse has been backported and is available via pypi.<p>To unify all this into one convenient module, I ended up writing <a href=""http://ipartola.github.com/groper/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipartola.github.com/groper/</a>. groper lets you specify your parameters declaratively, and if you specify defaults, use them right away without having to create/modify a config file.

Increasing recruitment measures in diverse places so as not to pass up good employees is great. But the language of the article used &quot;we have along way to go&quot; (till you reach what?), this is not where we want to be (where do you want to be then?), the assumptions (that everyone of every race and gender are equally interested in tech), as well the alarming and uneducated accusations of racism in the G+ comments on the blog post by itself is what sends us white folks into defense mode. Society currently finds it trendy to blame us for all of its problems. We&#x27;re slowly becoming the new Jews. We &quot;have too much&quot;, we &quot;control too much&quot;, this city is &quot;too white&quot;, that neighborhood is &quot;not diverse enough&quot;, &quot;White people make more money in ____&quot;. I&#x27;ve noticed it everywhere from newspaper articles, movies, music, commercials, SNL skits, public education text books. There&#x27;s an increasing bias for blaming whites as a whole.<p>Over 100+ million White Europeans have died in wars caused by other White Europeans (and we&#x27;ve moved on) yet slavery is constantly used to shame and describe us. We&#x27;ve hurt our own race and people more than other races yet our conflicts with other races is emphasized to vilify us. In areas where Asians, Hispanics, Whites, and Blacks share equal blame for a problem, whites are singled out and blamed because we&#x27;re the majority and have nice things. It&#x27;s assumed we &quot;can take it&quot;. As a European living in America it&#x27;s infuriating to find others blaming problems of the past on me when my culture and people (Bulgarians) had nothing to do with slavery, colonisation of Africa, or the holocaust. All 700+ million whites are blamed for the past sins of a small fraction of us all in the name of fighting racism and being a hero to the little guy. Fighting racism with racism is becoming America&#x27;s favorite tragicomedy past time. We&#x27;ve learned that &quot;talking about race or diversity&quot; really means &quot;blame white people for ___&quot; which is why we&#x27;ve learned to just not talk about race at all. This is where a lot of our defensive anger comes from. It&#x27;s where mine comes from. I&#x27;m sorry for my anger.",1401344626

And the Harvest Cache (now called Squid) was started at least by 1994.<p>> <i>[...] As a result, FTP and HTTP servers find themselves swamped with requests for the same popular files, like the demand for images of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet which saturated NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's wide-area network links in July 1994. As a result, there has been an attempt to retrofit caches for internet information system servers like the popular CERN proxy-http cache. One recently developed cache which deserves further examination is the Harvest cache, which boasts improved performance of an order of magnitude over the CERN cache and even over popular http daemons like Netscape's Netsite and NCSA's 1.4 httpd.</i>",1231430195

$991<p>To be fair, they aren't equivalent systems completely.<p>* Amazon you can scale up or down your bandwidth and just pay for usage.<p>* SoftLayer you have a 1,000Mbit port rather than the 250Mbit port in EC2.<p>* Amazon you can scale storage effortlessly, SoftLayer you need physical drives or to pay for their NAS at $0.40/GB.<p>* Amazon you can provision in minutes, SoftLayer takes hours.<p>* Amazon snapshots are easy, don't know about SoftLayer.<p>* SoftLayer often runs promotions like double RAM and double HD so you can knock the price down by $120/mo based on that.<p>AWS isn't cheap, but it's easy.  SoftLayer is offering a great deal too, but I like (at least the concept of) being able to launch a new box within 5 minutes if one dies and being able to just say, ""hey, do a delta snapshot to S3, thanks!"" rather than dealing with creating a reliable backup strategy.  I do love the idea of getting a 32GB RAM server for the price of a 16GB one and a 1,000Mbit port, but I don't want to give up the ease that Amazon offers.<p>So, AWS isn't so out of the ballpark.  There's a premium for the complete flexibility to scale storage from 1GB to several TB (or even petabytes with S3) and the ability to launch instances on demand and backup with no hassle and I'm willing to pay that if it's reasonable and AWS is reasonable.",1231430018

I don't type any faster than I used to either, but I've lost most of the wrist pains that I had when using Qwerty, and I enjoy the fact that everything is in a much more logical position.<p>I find that most keys are in ""better"" positions for general development, even in vim (I always use the arrow keys, not hjkl).  Having the colon key right next to shit is extremely convenient, as the ability to one-hand `:qa` when I'm done.  The dash/underscore key is infinitely easier to reach on Dvorak, which is immensely helpful when dealing with C and PHP code that tends to use underscores for variable and function namings.  My only complaint is that the [ ] brackets are further away, but the gains I have from the rest of the layout more than make up for that inconvenience.<p>I also took the time to remap the physical keys on my laptop, and purchased a couple inexpensive mini keyboards (no numpad) that have laptop-style keys and were reportedly very easy to switch layouts, and I use one at home and took the other to my job.  Having physically-mapped keys went a long way towards helping me out, and at least helps out anyone else who sits down at my machines.",1231429522

When that happens, your chances of convincing someone that they're wrong (assuming that they're wrong) drop to zero, while the level of polarization goes up. Granted, some people are so hardened in their beliefs that only widespread ridicule may be able to put a crack in their shell (albeit at high psychological cost).",1231428137

424985,comment,424699,424699,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's worth remembering that Dale Carnegie was a salesperson. Salespeople can afford not to criticize. That's because, when the sales negotiation ends, they will present you with a contract to sign -- a contract that has been written by some of the bluntest, most critical, most paranoid people on Earth: Lawyers. Salespeople get away without criticizing because they outsource the task to lawyers.<p>As an engineer, it pays to have great sales skills, but you have a much harder task than the average salesperson, because ultimately your job is more like the lawyer's. Your <i>raison d'etre</i> is to build things that <i>actually work</i>. In the famous words of Richard Feynman:<p><i>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.</i><p>And that forces engineers to be critical. The decisions they make in the early parts of a project could make an order-of-magnitude difference in the eventual cost. If they don't find the holes in the plan (""gosh, won't your proposed friends-of-friends search scale as O(N^3) and ultimately bring your social network to its knees?"") or properly evaluate the likelihood of rare-but-deadly scenarios (""is it worth a million dollars to guard against the odds that our offsite backup's drive controller will fail just as an earthquake takes out our primary data center, or shall we just buy insurance?"") the whole enterprise could fail catastrophically.<p>Perhaps many engineers err on the side of too little Dale Carnegie. But it's telling that many of the great ones don't so much <i>avoid</i> criticism as get really, really good at <i>selling</i> criticism to you. Think of Steve Jobs, one of the most critical people in human history, who gets away with it by playing the role of a fanatically driven artist. Or Torvalds, who is really blunt but turns it into a joke: He makes fun of his own bluntness (he named his DVCS ""git"" -- look it up in the dictionary!), he's deliberately over the top, and he plays strictly to an audience of engineers, who are more likely to see the humor in lines like ""CVS users are ugly and stupid"" than the average person is.<p>Try to moderate your criticism, but don't forget that ultimately it is your job. Don't lose focus on it.",1231428066

Remembering some details from a chapter in Bill Bryson's <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> on the park, I attempted to explain to her that Yellowstone was, in fact, a supervolcano.<p>The problem was that I couldn't remember many details other than that Yellowstone was a supervolcano, that it was due to erupt, and that if it exploded we'd all be in a lot of trouble. Frustrated that I didn't remember more than that, I went back and found the following from the book:<p>""Yellowstone sits on top of an enormous hot spot, a reservoir of molten rock that rises from at least 125 miles down in the Earth. The heat from the hot spot is what powers all of Yellowstone's vents, geysers, hot springs, and popping mud spots. Beneath the surface is a magma chamber that is about forty-five miles across-roughly the same dimensions as the park-and about eight miles thick at its thickest point. Imagine a pile of TNT about the size of Rhode Island and reaching eight miles into the sky, to about the height of the highest cirrus clouds, and you have some idea of what visitors to Yellowstone are shuffling around on top of.""<p>At one point a few months back I read those lines, and yet all I remember now is ""Yellowstone is a massive supervolcano."" I read an entire chapter and that's was all I could explain to someone; very few specifics.<p>Two questions: When you read do you remember specifics or just the big picture?

You could improve on it by pretty much runlength encoding the table.

I thought they were 2 different images).<p>So, I guess just to start off...where is the actual copy of &quot;Upload, organise, and share your photographs....&quot; actually stored. I don&#x27;t see that copy in the .slim file at all.

6005648,comment,6003579,6005481,5,0,jholman,,,"I&#x27;ve seen a video with a guy ranting about that, but I&#x27;m not looking for it again, because I think he&#x27;s spinning PR and doing dodgy math.<p>Thought experiment time.<p>Look at <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42870</a> (which is discussing 2007, so if you can find a more-up-to-date source, I&#x27;d love that).<p>From that article, the top quintile paid an average rate (not their marginal rate, of course!) of 25.1% of their income in federal taxes, and that these payments made up 68.9% of all federal income taxes.  A little arithmetic there shows that if you upped their federal taxes by 50%, they&#x27;d lose 12.5% of their gross, and that would cover 100% of the revenue currently generated by federal personal income taxes.  So if you wanted to tax the rich and not tax the poor, and by &quot;tax&quot; you mean &quot;federal income tax&quot;, it&#x27;s hugely doable!<p>If you&#x27;re wondering how much of total federal revenue is personal income tax, it appears to be around 40% to 50%.<p><a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/numbers/revenue.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/numb...</a><p><a href=""http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2007USrn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2007USrn</a><p>So that means that the 25.1% of income paid by the top quintile makes up 0.68*0.42 == 28.5% of federal revenue.  It&#x27;s pretty clear that if you kept the second-to-top quintile taxed as they are now (12% of federal revenue), cut payroll taxes in half (to say 20% of federal revenue), and kept the non-tax revenue (roughly 10%), that the remaining 58% could be met by slightly-worse-than-doubling the taxes on the rich.<p>Again.  Double taxes on the richest quintile, keep taxes as they are on the next richest quintile, halve payroll taxes, and keep non-taxes, and you&#x27;re done.  You can set corp taxes to zero, and also income taxes for the bottom 60% to zero.<p>So.  If you want to tax just the richest 1%, you can&#x27;t run the country on that.  But you absolutely can run the country just by taxing the rich.  If you wanted to.<p>(Note: this was a thought experiment, not advocacy.  I am not a fan of this proposal.  I just want to demonstrate that videos like the one I&#x27;ve seen, saying it&#x27;s impossible to just tax the rich, are using shaky math.)",1373270142

And I do think this whole thing was an important wake-up call. But it really seems that Snowden has gone beyond any capacity for protection -- the leaks are so far-reaching that it will be easy to steamroll and discredit him.

This information is too much, too fast, and is overwhelming reasonable options for what can be done.

6005644,comment,6001843,6004066,17,0,programmarchy,,,"I disagree.<p>This ruling, and others like it hint at a fundamental flaw in constitutional law and how most people perceive their relationship with the state, particularly in regard to social contract theory. These rulings call into question the very legitimacy of state authority.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for a moment there is a social contract with the state. Then, as in all contracts, there is a reciprocal obligation. Specifically, as a citizen, I have a duty of allegiance (obey state laws, pay taxes, etc.) in return for the duty of protection, from my government. Since the state itself has ruled it has no constitutional duty to protect, then the contract is inviolate, and long since void. In other words, there is no duty of allegiance to the state per the rulings of the courts if one takes social contract theory to be valid.<p>In my opinion, police corruption is one example of a foundational flaw in our current institution of governance: rule by means of coercion.",1373269904

At that point you probably don&#x27;t have to worry about money, assuming you don&#x27;t have any expensive hobbies. Taking time out to spend time with your children could be well worth it for a lot of people, since they don&#x27;t feel they actually need those extra $24750 for anything.<p>> To be the devil&#x27;s advocate, why not let people who do not have children take a 4 month paid ($24750) vacation every 5 years? I would like to take a round-the-world vacation for 4 months...<p>Because society wants to facilitate people having children (and a company might facilitate that if they are forced to by the government, or all of their competitors give the same benefits)? People can complain all day about overpopulation, but fertility rates in western countries are low, many places below 2.1 child per woman. Bringing in people from other countries brings with itself assimilation problems, and simply letting the population decline without interfering can lead to lopsided distribution of age brackets, for example to a disproportionate amount of pensioners that have to be supported by a shrinking workforce.",1373269895

6005638,comment,6005291,6005291,1,0,PaybackTony,,,"Generally speaking, I&#x27;ve tried to stay away from messing with products or services that require a lot of marketing, and go with ones that tend to market themselves. General ideas (such as classifieds) have big potential, but require the most work to get sustainable traction.<p>With that said, building the product is half the battle. Put it up by yourself. The biggest question you need answered right now is what do random visitors to your service think of the overall concept? Any flavor of classifieds websites will have some kind of critical mass, but that wont stop a few visitors from making an attempt at using it. If you get some positive feedback, or even negative, use it. If it&#x27;s positive, it will go a long way in finding a valuable partner. It will give you hard data to share that will start to pave a path for you.<p>The problem with splitting a pie that hasn&#x27;t been baked is that nobody knows what the flavor will be. You may be a great baker but the consumers are the ones who will inevitably decide your offering (Apple).<p>Once you get a basic data set from those few visitors you were able to convince to at least give your service a glance, now it&#x27;s time to grow your inventory. The best things you can do as a lean start-up is find some mutual business relationships. Can car dealers post some of their inventory on your site? If so, they would love to do it and it gives you a little bit of content. There are many other similar circumstances you can find yourself in. I find it most effective when you can get other businesses to sell your product for you because it enhances their own.<p>To get back to the root answer here, my suggestion is do a solo soft launch. Gather usage data from early visitors, and use it to grow your inventory and perhaps more importantly, find a valuable partner.",1373269786

What is intellectual property?",http://www.papaki.com/blog/2013/07/08/can-someone-ask-for-my-domain-name-what-is-intellectual-property/,"Say that while searching for your next best domain name you discover a small treasure: a very popular brand has not registered the relevant domain name (e.g. google.comyes, I know how ridiculous it sounds, but its just an example). So you rush and you make the registration.<p>Deep down you know theres something wrong. However youre the one who registered the domain name anyway. You may it sell it later to Google and get some money. It is yours now.<p>Once upon a time on the Internet when things were unorganised such a move could work and it did work sometimes. But not anymore. Now it all comes to trademarks and intellectual property.<p>Intellectual property refers to ones own rights. It includes copyright and patents. So if someone has registered a trademark, according to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, she has also the rights to use it and to protect it on the Internet too. To protect can mean a dozen different things but most of the times it is pretty simple: for example, not letting anyone use a trademark as hers without permission. Of course nobody would claim Google as his own brand (except for the real owners), but it could happen to less known brands. To protect also means to prevent people from the systematic abuse of the trademark, which is something that could obviously hurt the brand. And the list goes on.<p>So registering the particular domain name doesnt make you the owner of it. On the contrary you enter the dangerous zone of cybersquatting, an action of bad faith which aims to exploit the goodwill of a trademark which belongs to someone else. In fact the relevant American law of Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act has been designed for preventing actions like this. The particular law was enacted in 1999. So if you have ever heard a story of someone who acquired a domain name of a famous brand and then sold it to the owner, it must have happened before 1999.",1373269435

6005544,comment,6003579,6003579,4,0,CleanedStar,,,"Yes, a VC is looking to unshackle the middle class, thank you!  Someone is looking out for the US middle class, Scott Kupor, managing partner Andreessen Horowitz apparently.<p>Barf.  Who is dumb enough to swallow this?  Sounds like an echo of Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;I look out for the little guy&quot;.<p>You tend to hear this term &quot;middle class&quot; from on high a lot, as it means absolutely nothing.  What is the middle class in the middle of?  Apparently people with income of $200k or over, or assets of $1 million+ are not middle class in his definition.  Excluding worth of primary residence of course, which he neglected to mention.  I guess this means doctors are not middle class.  They must be in the upper class - a doctor is in the same class as Alice Walton, who inherited $26 billion.  What is the dividing line between the middle class and the class under it?  What class are janitors in, middle, lower?  Class used to mean ones relation to production, but that doesn&#x27;t fit into the kind of babble people like to put out.<p>To the big point of why this is nonsense.  If you look at the Survey of Consumer Finances done by the Federal Reserve, that 4% of Americans he speaks of are the ones who hold the majority of stocks, the majority of bonds and whatnot.  Just look through one of these Federal Reserve papers and you&#x27;ll see that, other than primary residences, this top 4% own almost everything.  Outside of primary residences, the next 5% to 20% swallow up pretty much everything the top 4% does not get.  Which is not much, relatively.  The bottom 80% have virtually no wealth outside of primary residences.<p>The idea that the median American will benefit from investing in VC is ludicrous.  The median American does not have the money to invest and benefit from this.  Stocks, dividends and profits are a weapon against the median American.  They are dependent on the stock owners, the small top minority, getting the lion&#x27;s share of the wealth created by the median American.  If American workers had strong unions and most of the created wealth in corporations went to wages, not dividends, this would hurt the owners of stocks.  The weaker the median American is in this equation, the better the stock does.  The median American is all about wages, the crumbs of VC he might pick up are almost nothing.  He has no money to invest, so even if his shares go up 20% a year, it amounts to very little.<p>Obviously, this is yet another thing to benefit the very wealthy.  But to sell it, people have to say it&#x27;s for the middle class.  Whereas the middle class, whatever that means, is actually hurt when the wealth they create at companies goes to profit and not wages.  It is coming out of their pockets - they create the wealth, then it goes out to heirs like Alice Walton in the form of dividends.  Or payments to limited partners from VC.  And the like.",1373267520

6005534,comment,6004052,6005374,13,0,grey-area,,,"<i>I&#x27;m not sure what the goal of this leak is anymore. Snowden is completely fucking himself over while diverting public attention from issues that have the best odds of an immediate fix -- the surveillance of Americans.</i><p>I think he simply wants Americans, and the world, to know the truth about what their governments are doing, and doesn&#x27;t believe that the best chance of that happening is staying within the bounds set by US law. He probably believes the best chances for pushback on privacy lie outside the five-eyes states, because those states have been co-opted so completely by their intelligence services. In the UK for example, every secret communication of every politician, judge and public servant is now available to those services.<p>Binney in his heart still believes the US government can be reasoned with and negotiated with and it seems you agree with him. It appears Snowden has decisively broken with that point of view and sees it at somewhat naive (probably after seeing what was done to Binney and Manning). As to treason (in a broad sense as betraying his country), I think that depends on whether you believe he&#x27;s exposing wrongdoing or not. If he&#x27;s found extensive wrongdoing, it&#x27;s impossible to make that public without damaging the US in the short-term, but in the long-term, he may believe what he does is in the interests of the US. I certainly agree with him.<p><i>Sorry, non-Americans: the Constitution doesn&#x27;t cover you guys. But we need to protect ourselves from our own laws first before we can help the rest of the world.</i><p>Personally I think we should try to move past this sort of parochial patriotism and look at this issue as one which affects the whole world. If you accept the argument that foreigners may be spied upon, and anyone having contact with foreigners, you&#x27;re accepting that anyone who does business outside the US or has contacts outside the US is a potential surveillance target. That probably covers almost the entire cosmopolitan US population nowadays. So much for American privacy. You also accept that states like the UK and Canada will be allowed to take every bit of information that passes through them and pass it back to the NSA, because that data is now &#x27;foreign&#x27;. By the same argument text messages in the UK are all swept up, because they pass over the border for technical reasons apparently.<p>Of course the only country and legal framework we can currently work within is our own, but it is inconsistent and ultimately futile to view this as a struggle for rights in only one country, because the network which we&#x27;re objecting to is global in scope and global in ambition.<p>Perhaps more important than the difficulties of separating foreign from US data is the damage this attitude causes to the standing of the US in the world - if this deepens the perception that there is one law of US citizens and another for everyone else, why should other countries treat American data and persons with respect?",1373267253

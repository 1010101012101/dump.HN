3113265,comment,3111133,3111731,2,0,haliax,,,"> I guess this depends on how advanced your toolkit is.<p>I'm assuming you mean this to counter the ""simplest of biological neural networks"" part, rather than the ""completely opaque black boxes"" part. Nonetheless, I think it is fair to say that ANNs still fall far short of the complexity of even the simplest biological brains. For example, even the nervous system of a Hydra features neurotransmitters [1] (as opposed to just heterogeneous signals of ANNs) and brains are affected by their own electric fields [2].<p>> You want to be able to discern some rule base from the system that you can understand? Even biological brains do not have that property.<p>More generally, transparency is important to be able to understand the inductive bias you've built up, and to try to alter or refine it in useful ways.<p>Also, the fact that our brains lack transparency doesn't justify leaving it out of an AI system, nor does it demonstrate the difficulty of building a transparent AI -- nature just had no drive towards transparency. Plus we (humans) can introspect and explain our reasoning.<p>> See, but the problem is that we don't even have the knowledge of how real brains work to start forming such principals\n> based on a technique which reflects the structure of the problem of learning, generalization, and hypothesis search and illuminates it.<p>This is only the case if we're speaking about biological brains, and not as a generic word to mean ""intelligent system"". In the latter case, we do in fact, have quite a bit of knowledge about such principles from reasoning about hypothesis spaces. From where we get things like active learning, or Solomonoff's work on Universal Induction [3].<p>> It's not going to be a fully general, ""human-level"" AI, obviously, as that requires huge amounts of semantic knowledge about the world that was encoded through billions of years of evolution<p>By ""semantic knowledge"" do you mean inductive bias? Because otherwise I'm at a loss. I don't believe that the picture for Artificial General Intelligence is as bleak as you make it sound though.<p>As an aside, you mention ""Lots of more biologically-inspired approaches have been explored"". Do you know of any projects looking to mine the structure of various parts of brains to figure out the sorts of inductive bias those structures correspond to? (As opposed to just copying structure) What I mean, is that presumably if a part of the brain heavily involved in recognizing faces has a unique structure/wiring, that structure is optimized such that it performs well on face recognition -- and correspondingly poorly on something else, per no free lunch -- and that optimization should tell us something about the nature of recognizing faces. Sort of in the same way that the use of a Naive Bayesian classifier rather than a Bayesian Net might tell you that the classifier is optimized for cases where the variables are independent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=WWN_t498S5IC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=hydra+neurotransmitter&source=bl&ots=sWZLilGZJf&sig=n5w3Jpg-RmChysK1U8rY35x8v0Q&hl=en&ei=i5yYTtb-IKbq0gHQ9InXBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=hydra%20neurotransmitter&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=WWN_t498S5IC&pg=PA12&#3...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=brain-electric-field"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=brain-elect...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://world.std.com/~rjs/pubs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://world.std.com/~rjs/pubs.html</a>",1318632782

Especially now since there aren't any practical limits on youtube video size, duration, or quality.<p>There is already a lot of pretty high quality original content on youtube. Some of that content is more popular than some cable content. There are youtube channels which have weekly updates and see millions of viewers on every episode. They are under the traditional media radar though since they don't have a promotional budget and they don't appear in a program lineup anywhere.<p>This trend can only accelerate from here. Producing a ""show"" or a ""movie"" requires a teeny, tiny amount of effort and resources these days, and can be done without spending more than 4 figures on equipment and whatnot.<p>We are nearing an inflection point in this process, soon there will be a critical mass of shows and viewers such that word-of-mouth recommendations start exploding viewership and more importantly that it begins to become cemented in the zeitgeist that making an ""internet tv show"" is a perfectly acceptable thing to do, regardless of how talented you are, and more so is a quite feasible thing to do. That will lead to a spiraling increase in both content and viewership which will likely catch a lot of the traditional media folks off guard.

My economics professor used to talk about ""the destructive winds of innovation or invention"". I think this might be a perfect example of this. Markets are a messy place where new ideas displace old ones, new models challenge old models and sometime you compete with companies that behave in unsustainable and irrational ways. I think you can wish it wasn't that way but I tend to believe this is a symptom of the human condition. What alternative is there?

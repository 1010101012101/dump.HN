- NO, because hardware isn't good enough and even if it were, why would anybody buy this, if they can't watch movies or listen to their music without too much hassle? Let's build a music (& movie) store, so that when the hardware is ready, we are ready too.<p>2005: Can we sell this tablet (or phone)? 
- No, the hardware is good enough now, but we need great software too. Let's build a great mobile OS (from scratch) and leave the legacy behind. And give the 3rd party developers the SDK and tools to build great apps for our device.<p>2010: Can we sell this tablet?

2923899,comment,2923221,2923250,6,0,jmspring,,,"I have to agree, and a lot of the other responses in this thread are disheartening/annoying.<p>The biggest thing Steve Jobs brought to Apple was to build a culture that supported his vision.  Apple as a whole is focused on the mold that Steve brought back with him.  Tim Cook has been the avatar and excellence in this image on the operations/production side. A company that has <i>AMAZING</i> profit margins on it's products due to the operational efforts to buying up needed parts ahead of time, etc.  I suspect Jonathan Ive will be able to continue the design esthetic.  Apple is a company running on all cylinders to deliver focused products.  This differs greatly from the Apple before Job's returned.  Will the focus erode?  Possibly, maybe some of the perfection will be lost, but there is a much stronger base in plance than <i>ANY</i> other company in the valley in the last 20+ years.<p>Compare this with Microsoft when Bill Gates steped down.  While, I personally feel that MSFT has made some positive steps in mobile with the Nokia partnership and WinPhone 7 doesn't suck, the company wasn't focused.  Each department was kinda doing it's own thing.  Ballmer was left to try and build something out of a lot of disparite pieces.  As such, MSFT, as a stock, has basically flatlined for 10+ years.<p>I think it is safe to say, outside of Hewlett & Packard (more recently) and the Fairchild Eight, no single person has been more influential on the Bay Area technology scene in my lifetime (born and raised here).  I will go one step further, and state, I don't see any of the current ""elite"" Paige/Brin/Zuck/Ellison(he's still around and strong) contributing anywhere as much.<p>Steve, like Bill and Dave, Gordon Moore (etal), are in a class of their own.<p>I've loved/hated AAPL products over the years, but Steve has been nothing but a gem for the valley.",1314251524

There's something to be said for not discounting yourself too much when new to a field, but mostly if you don't know what to do you need to ask someone who does, so that you can actually <i>know</i> what you're doing<p>This summer I was coaching Congressional debate in Florida. I was effectively new to this form of debate because it was more of a performance than analytical activity. So I wrote a list of the speaking problems I didn't know how to coach, and asked another coach about everyone of them, right in front of the person who hired me. If I had acted like I knew everything already, I never would have asked. But asking allowed me to pull the ideas from coaches with very different backgrounds, and by the end of coaching several kids offered detailed reasons why I was the coach most helpful to improving their speaking skills",1314251324

I was making a list as I went along, and when I afterwards read the comments section I realized I had overlooked many more. That does not by itself affect the validity of the author's overarching thesis, but if someone can't be bothered to get their basic facts straight (e.g. Iceland's EU membership status), it casts serious doubt on their ability to perform the much more subtle and exacting task of sociopolitical analysis on the reader's behalf.<p>The article did raise several points about which I was previously unaware; I will pursue them through other sources. I'm unsurprised that the IMF pushed back against the plan to default on the loans. The IMF usually props up failing economies and forces legislation that lets foreign investors reduce or withdraw their local investments. Love it or hate it (and I incline towards the latter), putting your balls in the vice like that is standard operating practice for them--it's what they do. I was surprised to learn (and until it is confirmed elsewhere, I remain skeptical) that the UK and Holland threatened to freeze the funds of all Icelander-held bank accounts.",1314250988

The patent is on two things that are relevant here. 1: When you slide through pictures with your finger, and you move one picture to the right, is the empty space on the left filled with parts of the new picture?

But hey, that's the system.<p>Android 3.0 on tablets does not have this functionality as they run on a big screen with a different approach, hence Android 3.0 and thus also the Galaxy Tab that runs with 3.0 is not infringing.

Its comeback as the solution to the gender-neutral conundrum seems to me a pretty good answer to changing social conditions. It does stand out too much sometimes, but ""he"" and ""she"" stand out way worse, especially the dreadful overcompensating ""I'll just self-consciously regulate my gender distribution and make sure that at least half of the time my programmers and executives are a she"" business, which is based on a misunderstanding of how language evolves. You don't get to pick and choose your own usages - not without sounding pompous and stilted.<p>None of these options are perfect because language, like society, is in a transitional period.

Now I guess I know why.<p>This park has always had a difficult time filling its positions due to the poor way they treat their employees, mostly 15-16 year old, first-job kids. While I hope the foreign workers weren't being taken advantage of, given the park's history, I would be surprised if they weren't at least treated quite poorly.",1314249177

I made a post on Reddit explaining what I did[1] - bear in mind this is definitely a compromise, while it boosted one person's framerate from 20 FPS to 60 it bears more than a passing resemblance to Minecraft and 1997. TF2 is on the absolute edge of what I can play on here, but many games run perfectly fine with very few issues. However it's taken me 5 minutes to post this reply because every 20 seconds, textarea inputs on Firefox freeze and ignore anything I type for 10 seconds. Odd!<p>Running a netbook is very much a reminder that CPU speed is not a linear scale.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/e43fm/how_to_play_tf2_on_an_atom_260/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/e43fm/how_to_play_tf2_o...</a>",1314249146

But the fact that other companies also play the same game, some less successfully and most importantly, with less press, doesn't impact your opinion of those companies?<p>Since when has ""everyone else is doing it"" been a good justification? I'm tired of this kind of lowest-common-denominator-thinking in business. I'm tired of this implicit assumption that the only rational purpose for companies is to maximize profit and minimize their competition.<p>Maybe that's unfair, ridiculous, or childish. I don't really know.<p>> You should direct your anger at the source of the issue, software patents.<p>I do. I've also sunk software patents. While working at Microsoft I worked hard to find prior art for every patent proposed from any work I touched.<p>> Getting angry at companies doing what they need to in the current environment isn't very productive.<p>What's unproductive is maintaining the status quo. Apple is using patents to tactically bludgeon their strongest competition, and raising the cost of innovation in the process.

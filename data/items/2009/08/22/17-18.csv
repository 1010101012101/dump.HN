You will find it much, much easier to get attention from the media that way.  Your product is good enough to get into major newspapers if you pitch it right.<p>2)  You really, seriously need to improve your web design.  It looks like a ransom note.  It should look bright, clean, safe, and inviting.  You'll be selling to an overwhelmingly female audience.  Many of them will have never bought anything online before.<p>3)  Put one page of a sample book on the front page.  Even a thumbnail will do.  I'd suggest one with a smiling young boy.  Put a handwritten note next to the thumbnail, circling him, and saying ""This book was made special for Dylan.  Why don't you make a book special for your child?""<p>4)  Drop the email confirmation.  Drop the password confirmation.  These serve no purpose but to drastically decrease the number of users who sign up to your web site.  Deck that page out with reasons why they should give you their info (what does this get you?) and reasons they should trust you (this phrasing works absurdly well: ""We will not spam you."")  I would consider dropping the name field -- are you going to address them by it prior to them purchasing?  No?  Nix.<p>5)  The table at <a href=""http://www.cookupbooks.com/my_books"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cookupbooks.com/my_books</a> is confusing and meaningless to me -- and I live for selling teaching aids.  Your users are going to be totally lost.<p>6)  Find some satisfied customers and get a brief testimonial out of them.  You want something that essentially sounds like ""My son never liked reading, but he lit up when he was the star of the story!"" -- Kyle's Mom.  Feature that prominently next to decision points.<p>7)  You are selling books at $1 / book / student.  Parents are willing to pay <i>much</i> more than that.  I have doubts about it being profit-maximizing for teachers, either.  (For a point of reference, my typical customer pays $30 for a product they use roughly twice a year... and I undercharge terribly.)",1250963858

There are a <i>lot</i> of unavoidable little tasks that don't necessarily require writing code but do require care and attention.<p>Rest assured that, even if you don't end up spending 60+ hours per week doing all of this stuff, your partners are not just humoring you when they claim to be grateful that you're doing all of this.<p>The worst thing about many of these tasks is that they tend to be <i>asynchronous</i>. A lot of them need to be done during business hours, a lot of them involve phone tag or email tag, and even if a given task takes only ten minutes it can be enough to break your flow for an hour.

But it's there.<p>From what I can see, the largest gap is lack of support for other languages.<p>To the OP: Seems obvious that you should know off the top of your head which western countries have the highest population of people learning Chinese as a second language. Why not order that list descending and then build sites in those native languages, one by one?<p>To answer your question, the obvious answer to me seems to be Network, Network, Network.<p>I've read some of the stuff you've posted here before and I remember (i think) about you having some University deals.  Those are great. And I'm sure you'd agree that signing those deals is entirely about relationships and not about egalitarian ethos of the best way to educate. So make those relationships.<p>And another big thing, naturally, is corporate training. Chinese is now the most valuable second-language for American executives. And I'm sure it ranks high for European executives.<p>But a larger point is that I think to really get a toehold there would require a more comprehensive approach to learning the language. My guess is that an educator designing a corporate training program isn't going to want to design a program for 6-figure executives a'la carte.<p>So I would find a way to get my product in bed with complimentary products. And this, too, is about networking and relationships.<p>I think you're right that traditional marketing is not really going to work for you. As a casual observer, this market seems rather inelastic. And as far as I know, it's not as if you're just trying to snag share from a weaker product. You have to instead compete with the beliefs of people who are making decisions about how to teach Chinese. You have to compete with their beliefs about what works best.<p>I know this isn't the advice if you were going for. But really all you can do is be the best damn front man for your company that you've ever seen or even imagined. That is a skill you can sharpen, and it's a role that is every bit as valuable to a software company as the programmers themselves.<p>And one last thought in my grab-bag of a post... Have you thought about social integration somehow? Maybe like head-to-head competition between 2 friends, giving them symbols to draw and a countdown and a score?  Random, but I thought of it when i was watching the video. And that video is the best thing on your site, by the way.

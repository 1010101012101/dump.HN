I can't help but feel like all this hooplah about Bitcoin's ""price"" on the dollar is missing the point of Bitcoin.  People are measuring Bitcoin's worth by how many <i>dollars</i> it costs; is that <i>really</i> the measure of worth of a currency, or simply the measure of worth of a <i>dollar</i>?<p>It would be much fairer for people to measure Bitcoin's worth by (for example) how many gallons of milk or how many pounds of rice you could buy with it.  But since we need to <i>somehow</i> know how much this medium of exchange is worth, and since Bitcoin still has very low adoption, we're using the dollar as a way of assigning worth to these imaginary collections of bits, and that makes it a target of speculation and bubble mentalities.  In other words, we should tie its worth to something useful you could actually spend it on, instead of just using as it as a Monopoly-money ""investment vehicle"".<p>IMHO Bitcoin will never be able to be taken seriously until the price is pegged to some physical product of real-world value.  Until then, it'll just be a USD proxy and thus functionally worthless to anyone but academics, speculators, crypto-nerds, and black marketeers who don't understand that Bitcoins aren't truly anonymous.  The system has a chicken-and-egg problem of adoption, and right now given the poor PR it's receiving it looks like it's heading in the wrong direction.",1365723648

Any conclusions about its usefulness or lack thereof should be made based upon that fact.<p>Which is to say, it's not a very good <i>currency</i>--and anyone who is taking a long position that Bitcoin will somehow replace or surpass any real currency is a fool who this bubble is going to bankrupt. But, if you just need some bits that hold a (however-ephemeral) value--not a <i>high</i> value, just <i>any defined</i> value--without any central authority needing to <i>back</i> that value, then BTC seems like a good option.<p>A good example of a use for ""bits that have a spot price regardless of any central authority"" might be, say, a market for CPU cycles for agents within a distributed computation mesh (somewhat ironically, a dual to Bitcoin's own mining process.) Picture a version of, say, the Erlang VM, where processes could voluntarily surrender some part of each allocated timeslice to other processes who they ""owed."" Agent processes would need to create highly divisible units of currency to pay other agents on other (untrusted!) systems in exchange for their time.<p>""Real money"" would be very hard to use in this system--if every single agent had a real bank account, transaction fees would quickly overwhelm the system's usefulness. And ""fiat play-money"" (machine-hour-tokens or something) would only work if everyone could agree, across the whole distributed mesh, that they were worth something, <i>and</i> either there was a ""central bank"" with which all transactions had to coordinate (turning the distributed system into a hub-and-spoke design), or all systems could be <i>trusted</i> to allocate agents units of of currency only in proportion to productivity.<p>Bitcoin is something a machine can make, and which will have a price for long enough for it to use to pay another machine for useful work. Also, it cannot be made <i>without</i> doing work proportional to the cost of making it. This combination of factors makes Bitcoin unusual enough to be useful in some limited cases.

Now I'm not so sure.<p>I think there should be a third option in the form of a decentralized social protocol.<p>I think there is market for a ""social rss"" where you could choose amongst a number for providers, ""Google Readers"" for social if you will, that could connect to each other. That way people could choose their frontend and the way they consume their friends social feeds. This would open competition and give people choices of different user interfaces, layouts and themes.<p>For public posts the implementation could be fairly straightforward. I assume other providers would periodically fetch friends posts, upvotes, downvotes and other social interactions from other networks.<p>When it comes to private content, the providers would probably have to send things only to other trusted providers that promise to show it only to the correct ""circles"". However, I don't see it as a big deal since privacy in G+ and Facebook is already somewhat of an illusion because it only takes one amongst hundreds of friends to share your stuff outside the network. Maybe your friends would need to authenticate into your network and do email verification at least once. Maybe they could use a Mozilla Persona authentication?<p>There are companies that could do this without too much effort. Tumblr already publishes rss of their user's feed, they would only need to add the ability to consume rss and push for an upgrade of the rss protocol to support social features.<p>Digg has shown interest in doing an rss reader, why shouldn't they work on upgrading the protocol to include more social features?<p>Other web based rss reader companies could do it.<p>A new team from this community.<p>Or even better, cooperation of all of the above!",1365723532

The cost of such hedging may be less than the cost of traditional fees and chargebacks.<p>But maybe Bitcoin's not even best understood as a 'currency'. That's just a word, whose broad semantic boundaries were fixed in the early 20th century, before anything like Bitcoin, or even the Internet and general-purpose computers, existed.<p>So arguing over whether Bitcoin is a good 'traditional currency' is boring. What's interesting is whether Bitcoin is valuable, on its own terms as something new, and whether it will be more valuable in the future.<p>A bubble this day/week/month/year doesn't tell us much about that question. Volatility only affects some uses -- like your example of publishing prices of other things in Bitcoin. Other potential users are, or could be, indifferent to volatility, as long as the trend is up. Some will even like volatility, if that volatility is usefully uncorrelated with other assets.<p>And if your pronouncement isn't that it's an overvalued, speculative bubble, but simply that it's going to have upswings and downswings, but is just as likely to be more valuable at any future point as less, then so what? Often ultimately-valuable equity shares in some new project go through wild value swings, because long-term success is so hard to predict and sensitive to so many unknowns.<p>I'm not a fan of the limited 'payments system' framing of ""what Bitcoin is"", but maybe you can think of a way to pick a date in the future where we can objectively assess whether Bitcoin is growing as a payment mechanism or not.<p>At that point we'll know whether the volatility has destroyed Bitcoin's value as a payments system, or whether Bitcoin's use in payments has thrived despite (or maybe even aided in non-intuitive ways by) the headline-grabbing volatility. Offer a testable prediction generated by your insight, and we'll test it!<p>The test of my insight, that Bitcoin is something valuable whether it's a currency or not, is: is Bitcoin worth more in 2014 than 2013?

The main problem with TEC cooling is that you can get under 0 degrees, and that leads to condensation on the logic board (not something one would want). Mineral Oil freezes at around -30 degrees C, so you can cool components below zero without having those problems. Though if you're using TECs for cooling, then efficiency isn't something that one would be interested in.<p>Otherwise, mineral oil needs pumps, and in general could be harder to design cooling components due to the different density of the fluid. High surface area coolers that are used with fans might not let the oil pass through fast enough to limit heat accumulation. You'd need to design laminar flow heat sinks and pumps that keep the oil flowing over the most critical parts. If one pump fails, you risk localized overheating. At least with standard fan/air cooling you can have multiple fans that keep the hot air from staying in the case (or some racks have A/C vents entering from the bottom front and exit from the top rear to keep positive pressure and continuous cooling.<p>The limiting factor could be logic board design to make sure there's no turbulence between the components and cooling equipment so there aren't any hot spots that could damage components.

Technically, it won't even disappear.<p>Bitcoin has many fundamental uses as an exchange of value (note the vernacular) that is not done properly by anything else. It is the reason that markets like the Silk Road can exist. The ""fundamental"" flaw of bitcoin is that it is deflationary. This causes mass speculation, which causes instability.<p>It's instability means that it is not a good store of value. It is good for exchange of value under certain conditions (anonymous, distributed, trust required, cryptographic, etc.). Bitcoin is taking a hit right now because all of the speculators are cashing out (or panicking, or whatever). Most of the people who use bitcoin for it's fundamental strengths only hold on to bitcoin briefly. This is one of the (perhaps unintended) features of the commodity.<p>Bitcoin is not good for measuring value. You would never set a price in terms of bitcoin. You would set the price in terms of dollars or euros and then use a conversion to figure out what the price in bitcoins should be. This will probably always be the case for bitcoin transactions, because that's just how bitcoin is.<p>But as long as bitcoin does 'distributed, anonymous, and cryptographic' better than everybody else, it will be used for those strengths, and this will keep it alive.

I personally think this is somewhat circular reasoning (""People don't use RSS, so we won't show an icon letting them know about RSS""), but sadly other browsers such as Firefox have followed their lead and removed RSS notifications by default.<p>Also, whether or not the browser implements native RSS auto-discovery is irrelevant to the point of the article. The Chrome extension in the article could be easily implemented by checking for a special <link> element, so that no URLs need to be sent back to Google just to know that the page is Plus-enabled.<p>However, off the top of my head, there's a good reason why this wouldn't do much good. The advertised functionality of the Google+ extension requires details about the Google+ stream that the page links to. If the extension checked for a <link>, it would still need to send the URL in that link to Google to get those stream details. The privacy improvement seems marginal.<p>In the end, I think this complaint is better served by declaring that the URLs aren't recorded.

One thing that leaped out at me was your mention that the first beta was a disaster because it didn't comply with Amazon's payment-processor requirements, so you burned a lot of capital making good on your promises. This sort of thing is why I keep saying more startups need a legal person on board early on - and with a surplus of underemployed JDs around, now is a great time to work that into your team plan.<p>Lawyers are not just there to object to things and make life difficult for dreamers, they're there to spot major potential pitfalls like this and steer around them. Far too many entrepreneurially-minded people see contractual and statutory constraints as some sort of obstacle course designed solely to prevent competition or enterprise, and react to said constraints by simply wishing them away. I was impressed that your reaction to this problem was to pay everyone as promised and retool your application to be compliant with Amazon's requirements, rather than simply blaming them for your problems.

Dub, Drum n' Bass, Electro, Latin American EDM, electronic Balkan, way too many to mention here.<p>There are literally millions of hours of recorded music; its market and creative value are far, far lower than what the big recording groups claim on the simple basis of the volume of production out there. Ironically, I have never heard of any of the (tens of thousands of) independent labels bitching about people remixing their tracks or uploading edits or playing them at gigs.<p>You sound like a person that purchases his or her music and listens to it mostly from radio or commercial sources.

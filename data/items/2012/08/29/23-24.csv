4452135,comment,4451690,4452074,12,0,redthrowaway,,,"That comes straight from pg, as reddit was his idea.  He sold it to Alexis and Steve as ""the front page of the Internet"", that is, a user-curated list of all of the most interest links out there.  While it may be read as ambitious, it was originally just intended to describe what reddit was and how it worked.  It was the precursor of the ""AirBnB for lightbulbs"" taglines that dominated pitches a couple years ago.",1346284770

4452133,comment,4450244,4451331,3,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Amen. That's the thing. You don't realize how many hoops you've been jumping through to do the same things that devs on Linus or OS X do effortlessly until you make the switch. But people don't make the switch because they have this blind loyalty to whatever theyre using. So whenever they see someone else loving a different OS they dole out ad nominee attacks, call the products over priced, or too complicated for normal users, or elitist. It's all to do with justifying one's decision to use X despite evidence that Y may be better or just as good and possibly some jealousy in some cases.<p>In any case it's all dumb blind loyalty the vast majority of the time. And that applies to Linux, Mac, and Windows. You can't have a discussion about operating systems with 90%+ of people because everyone just defends their favorite and facts are distorted to suit those preferences. It really is just about useless to have a discussion about operating systems as ""substantive"" or ""meaningful"" discussions about the subject are about as rare as unicorns.",1346284745
4452132,comment,4450244,4451396,3,0,tikhonj,,,"It is <i>not</i> the correct way to do it. It has some very simple problems.<p>First, if I have a bunch of little windows on a big screen--something very common on Apple computers--I have to drag my mouse all the way to the top of the screen and then drag it back. For me, this was an serious problem. Partly this was because I was also using one of the horrible Apple mice (the ""mighty mouse"" or something of that nature). This was particularly annoying because I would often lose focus by clicking on something else by accident and have to go all the way back to my original window and then all the way back to the top... Incredibly annoying.<p>Second, not all programs have--or need--options on top. I essentially live out of Emacs and Chrome these days; neither uses a menu. That would make the Apple bar just a waste of screen space--completely absurd. Moreover, I've found that bar to be superfluous on other software I use as well. Having more minimalistic interfaces is a breath of fresh air--and completely impossible on OS X.<p>It also fails to generalize well to multiple screens.<p>Oh, and there are going to be problems if you want to make the available options context-dependent. This is a reasonable design decision if you have a complex program with a bunch of small, discrete windows for different tasks--something else that isn't uncommon on OS X. This sort of behavior is far clearer if there is a menu per window than if there is a single menu for whatever is currently active.",1346284720

Unless you're in the top 1/3 of your class at a good law school or top 5% of your class at an OK school, getting a job is hard in today's market. Part of the reason law school (and school in general) is so expensive is because we've removed a lot of the risk from the loan side of the equation. We give you 7% money, guaranteed against default, and the schools jack up the prices. That combines with faulty transparency in which some law schools hide employment rates.

4451978,comment,4448970,4451777,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I would be surprised to meet a mathematician who enjoyed learning theorems/proofs more than finding theorems and proving things on their own.<p>One must crawl before one can walk. Reading the work of others is quite enjoyable. And not everyone yearns to reinvent the wheel -- for many problems, understanding the prior work gives one more than enough satisfaction.<p>> That's why I said the interesting part is the process of manipulating expressions rather than the expressions themselves.<p>A finished equation can stand alongside the finest art, and garner the same kind of appreciation. People still read Einstein's relativity equations, and Maxwell's electromagnetic equations, with a deepening appreciation of their beauty, quite apart from the degree to which they describe reality.<p>Also, there is the interesting task of applying equations to real-world problems. I don't need to rewrite the gravitational and tidal equations to discover new things while applying them.<p>> Based on your gravity/tides example, I think you would take the same stance (Do you?).<p>Not really. It would be like asking someone whether they prefer reading, or writing. Obviously the full experience of literacy involves both.<p>Here's a comparison -- a common problem for student writers, usually pointed out by someone with more experience, is that they haven't read enough to be able to write effectively. There's a parallel in mathematics -- those who take the trouble to read enough mathematics, by so doing learn how to express themselves more efficiently.<p>For me, the two equations I posted earlier, one that describes the gravitational force, and the other the tidal force, the mathematically interesting thing is the relationship between them, not so much the equations themselves -- the fact that a simple derivative operation produces the second equation (in physical terms it's because the tidal force is felt by any two adjacent masses placed arbitrarily close together).<p>For physical equations, working with them means either imagining their consequences, or modeling them, usually with a computer. In that case, you don't manipulate the equations, you use them to model reality. So having an equation that's known to represent some aspect of reality is just the beginning of a research program that models the consequences of the equation and compares the model to reality.<p>Here's an example. Observations of Jupiter's moon Io revealed the possibility of a large, static tidal force on its mass. You may be aware that a static force doesn't require any energy expenditure (imagine a book lying on a table). Then someone pointed out that Io has an elliptical orbit, which means Io is constantly moving toward, and away from, Jupiter. This would have the effect of changing the tidal force, and a changing tidal force would perpetually change the moon's shape -- and changing the moon's shape would require energy. This would generate a lot of heat. Shortly thereafter, volcanoes were observed on Io, a moon too small to have the kinds of volcanoes we have here, and the explanation was the elliptical orbit and tidal force.<p>That's mathematics.",1346282024

Kids taking different subjects from different teachers doesn't happen until middle or high school.<p>So I'd guess that most teachers of young kids probably chose to train as elementary-education generalists, and math was hard and scary for them.  There are several mechanisms by which this might rub off on their pupils:<p>1. If the teacher doesn't have an innate joy and passion for their subject, the lack of enthusiasm may be contagious.<p>2. The teacher may have no idea why things like the addition algorithm work, and no idea how to explain it to their students.<p>3. Most of the math classes in elementary school were largely spent reviewing material covered in previous years.  Having an expectation that students should know material that's been covered in previous lectures is simple common sense.  I'm not against an occasional review class, mind you, but spending an entire quarter or semester on nothing but previously covered material strikes me as a colossal waste of everyone's time.<p>4. High-stakes standardized testing is a recipe for disaster.  The tests don't accurately measure anything but the amount of time and effort teachers spend teaching to the test.  I was pretty far out of elementary school by the time No Child Left Behind hit the fan, but I'd imagine even knowledgeable, passionate teachers who want to motivate their students with the joy of learning to use their imagination to manipulate abstract ideas get immense pressure from above to turn their class into nothing but drill, drill, drill.<p>5. The very name, ""No Child Left Behind,"" implies is that the goal is to have the entire class proceed at the pace of the least capable student.  On the face of it, this is deliberately aiming for poor results.  For those of us who have never observed the human race in action before, let me explain:  People are different; they have different levels of mental strength, motivation, talent, and parental support; they have different areas of interest, different areas of talent, put in different amounts of effort, and think in different ways.  It is inevitable, then, that some people will be better at math than others.  But we seem to be trying extremely hard to deny this simple and obvious truth, to bring the least capable students to a level of competence that they may never achieve, at great cost to taxpayers and immense frustration for everyone.  Meanwhile, the middle- and high-capability tiers of the class are bored, frustrated and alienated by the endless repetition of very dull tasks -- which is most assuredly <i>not</i> what mathematics is about, especially since the invention of cheap, ubiquitous computers.",1346281665

That's why I shared it.<p>Most people fail at SEO because they simply aren't persistent. This method breaks down the process to the point where it's the easiest it's going to get to stay consistent with your link building efforts.<p>Also, it's really easy to avoid bad links with this method: If a site doesn't look legit, just skip it.",1346281311

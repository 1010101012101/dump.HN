Woz saw the great potential for the hardware he was making, and said that the only thing he wanted was a computer, something he actually wanted to use. With that motivation and excitement I can see how you&#x27;d want it to be perfect.<p>I&#x27;d say I wish more people had things they were so passionate about that what they were making felt to them it was more than just &#x27;software&#x27;, or &#x27;hardware&#x27;. If you are making a product purely to make money, I don&#x27;t think this mindset would be there, but if the product exists as something bigger (in Apples case, Jobs saw it as a &#x27;bicycle for your mind&#x27;, it wasn&#x27;t just a computer). I like to think if you allowed the people just slamming libraries together till something runs something they were truly passionate about, things may play out differently. But iono :p",1417751992

8702926,comment,8701114,8701114,0,0,Jonovono,,,"I like this. You can see why Steve and Steve made good friends/partners, at least in the beginning. I think most people think of Woz as the tech guy and Jobs as the everything else. But here you can see Woz&#x27;s love beyond just making the tech. For him it&#x27;s art, like the part at the start where he wanted to make it better and have fewer holes. Reminds me of Jobs talking about his dad and how he taught him if you are building something you have to care even about the things that would never be seen. I can&#x27;t find the story, but there was one about Jobs wanting to make everything inside the computer look nice, to the engineers frustration.<p>The two together seem to make an awesome bridge. Woz with the tech skills, but still with a passion to make things perfect and amazing and can see the potential for the designs (not just making it cause he&#x27;s told), and Jobs picking up seeing those things as well and wanting the products made that way and being able to express/sell those ideas to others (which sometimes it seems is very undervalued by tech people)",1417750933

8702922,comment,8702807,8702807,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This result (fewer readers for &#x27;good news&#x27;) isn&#x27;t particularly surprising. People read the news to find things they need to take action on, things that interrupt their normal life flow and tell them what to do. I read a paper that called it the Utopia Paradox[1] which described the situation where all needs are met, people cease to pursue ideas. I would find when starting a new job and leaving behind an email inbox full of demands on my time that the sheer choice of things to do is initially overwhelming.<p>So when you stop giving people things to worry about, and I think they use it as a crutch to organize their day, they are at a loss. Too often news is &quot;Its going to rain&quot; therefore I need to have my raincoat tomorrow, &quot;Idiots are going to win the election&quot;, therefore I need to vote, &quot;Kids are getting kidnapped&quot;, therefore I need to protect my kids. But when the news is, &quot;All the trains are on time!&quot; what help does that give you in planning your life? None. And in fact you have now &quot;wasted&quot; time on reading an article that hasn&#x27;t helped you figure out anything you need to prepare for or worry about, so that are only so many more minutes left in the day to prepare.<p>It&#x27;s a very strange cycle. You can play it the other way though, you can both report good news <i>and</i> give planning data, like &quot;The trains are all on time and cars are less reliable than they were, consider changing your plan to use the train tomorrow.&quot; That is the sort of positive news I&#x27;d prefer we got, &quot;Here is what is going on and here is some action you can take to help it continue and/or mitigate it.&quot;<p>[1] I suspect there are several alternate uses of this name though.",1417750763

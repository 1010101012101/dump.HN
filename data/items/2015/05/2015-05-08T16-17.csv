It&#x27;s a pretty obscure little hobby, and there&#x27;s not much to see at a lot of the highpoints.<p>I think you should probably be open to various experiences along the way - rather than try and force something to happen. At most of the highpoints, there really aren&#x27;t any people around, and there&#x27;s not really a lot of drama involved in getting to the flat ones like Florida and Delaware :)<p>Happy to help out in any way I can.",1431104391

For example, as people enter old age, they drink less and become more likely to die.  ...  In light of these facts, Occam’s Razor argues for a simple theory: the net marginal impact of drinking on health is negative at all levels; and moderate drinking is a marker for relative youth, affluence, and healthy habits rather than a cause of good health.</i><p>I guess he&#x27;s suggesting that the apparent positive correlation between moderate drinking and health is an example of Simpson&#x27;s paradox [0].<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox</a>",1431104102

For personal projects it&#x27;s perfect - write once, run natively everywhere, and with a single codebase for client and sever.<p>But there are good reasons not to use it too. Its community is still fairly small and highly game-dev-centric so you&#x27;ll probably have trouble finding the sort of high quality data science libraries you might find with a language like Python. That being said, haxe can take advantage of libraries on its target platform, so if you&#x27;re compiling haxe to python, all the python libraries are available to you. The next problem with haxe is that it&#x27;s the job market for it is still very small compared to the other major languages.<p>So it&#x27;s ideal for personal projects, where you just want to get as much done as possible without being bogged down by platform specifics, but unless you&#x27;re in game dev, you&#x27;re going to struggle to get employment from it.<p>I agree with anon3_ that Python&#x27;s a sensible choice for employability and compatibility. Node.js and ES6 are worth a look into too, especially if you&#x27;re looking to get into server-side work. Because of its popularity, there&#x27;s an awful lot of weight behind javascript and it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s easing up any time soon.",1431104064

The problem with the engineer in question was that he clearly wanted to use the company as a stepping stone.  While companies are fully aware that people move on, they are going to prioritize the people that seem like they are going to stick around for a while.<p>Turn it around and imagine you are the hiring manager.  If your prospect is making it clear that the only reason they are hiring on is so they can go elsewhere, how does that make you feel?  Remember, it costs money and time to bring someone in.<p>There is a difference between an employee and a contractor.  A lot of what people are saying here would make sense for a contractor.  A contractor is supposed to have a well honed skill set where they can come in, make a useful contribution right away, and move on to the next task.  Employees, at least in my mind, aren&#x27;t like that.  The company is signing up to educate the new hire, that&#x27;s an investment.  In the places I&#x27;ve worked (system places like Sun), it was fairly normal that it would be at least a year before the new hire did any work that shipped. Maybe it&#x27;s different now but that&#x27;s the world I&#x27;m used to.  So I&#x27;m looking at about $200K investment before I see anything at all hit the bottom line.  In that context, yes, I&#x27;m looking for someone to stick around for a while.<p>Again, I&#x27;m old, but I&#x27;ve been hiring in the valley for 20, maybe 25, years.  Maybe it&#x27;s different now, but one screening technique everyone used was to look at how long someone stayed in one place.  Someone who moves every 5 years is fine, someone who never makes it to 1.5 years is not great.<p>In this day of apps, maybe the dev cycle there is a lot shorter and so in that arena maybe you can pull in those numbers.",1431103995

That was fine because the binaries built from it weren&#x27;t distributed either, just used in house.  I worked under a very informal contract that didn&#x27;t state who owned the copyright for the work done, and didn&#x27;t put any limitations on distribution. I&#x27;m US based on the client was in Canada.<p>I&#x27;d like to publish this code publicly (github) because I&#x27;m proud of it and I think others might find it useful.<p>However, at this point, much of the source code I developed doesn&#x27;t have explicit copyright statements. I believe that I can claim copyright for these since it wasn&#x27;t explicitly granted to the client in a contract.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about how the (ex)client would feel about me distributing it and claiming copyright on those portions. I don&#x27;t work with them anymore, but I don&#x27;t want to burn bridges either. At the same time I don&#x27;t want to ask permission to do something I have the legal right to do.<p>Owning the copyright isn&#x27;t really a priority for me - I mostly just want it to be clear so I can publish it. Any thoughts on how to proceed?",1431103869

They only want x, y, or z and after you give it to them, well, you&#x27;re done.<p>If you have that sort of client and you&#x27;re charging by the hour, you&#x27;re an idiot. Quote them a fixed price at something like 500 per hour for what you estimate the work will take. They&#x27;ll go for it, you make bank.<p>At some point in your freelancing career you&#x27;re going to start feeling jealous. Of the &quot;normal&quot; guy.

Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the &quot;enhanced&quot; for loop in Java 1.5, as part of JSR-201. Notice what a difference macros make. A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source-level abstraction of that pattern. A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language. Then Sun has to publish a JSR and convene an industry-wide &quot;expert group&quot; to hash everything out. That process--according to Sun--takes an average of 18 months. After that, the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature. And even once the Java programmer&#x27;s favorite compiler supports the new version of Java, they probably still can&#x27;t use the new feature until they&#x27;re allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java. So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years.",1431103188

Also, as someone who also works on network crypto boxes: the main VPN protocols are _really_ nasty.<p>- OpenVPN requires TLS (you really don&#x27;t want to use static keying in OpenVPN), which is a total nonstarter: the TLS protocol itself has non-stop problems, is completely infeasible to implement from scratch, and does not have any implementations useful for a high-security embedded device. Also, the data channel protocol is ugly.<p>- DTLS-based VPNs are, well, DTLS-based (worse protocol than TLS, and still infeasible to implement).<p>- IPsec is comparatively sane if you limit yourself to statically-keyed tunnel-mode ESP with no internal NAT&#x27;ing (NAT-T is ok, though). IKE is a pain (and usually requires certificates, which are very hard to parse correctly), and supporting all the zillions of options is extremely expensive. On the other hand, static keying has many pitfalls and pretty much requires a mechanism to send updated keys. Also, IPsec overhead usually ends up being rather high in practice, and e.g. IPsec/L2TP is even worse.<p>- In practice, anything that requires connection negotiation requires some surgery to support high-packet-loss scenarios. (Loss-tolerant protocols over statically keyed IPsec work decently well at packet loss rates that break most IKE implementations.)<p>Also, for any given device, you&#x27;d usually prefer to support as few algorithms as possible and/or tailor choose crypto primitives that are well-supported on your hardware.<p>Finally, building a secure VPN wire protocol just isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> hard.

I&#x27;d like a work place that would encourage me to go home and enjoy myself on the bad days and stay as long as I want on the good days, instead of expecting a regular 40 hour work week every week (I have flex, but on average...).<p>In the words of Stephen King, &quot;Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.&quot;<p>Very often the value is in just showing up and doing the work. Even if the work isn&#x27;t your best work, it&#x27;s still better than no work. You can always fix bad work later. Even if you throw it away and start again, you&#x27;ve already primed yourself on the problem.",1431102624

Given that this is the case, you must also make the system robust, and one element of that is being disciplined about communicating program state via mechanisms such as heartbeats.  This is not a magic bullet, but produces much better results than a lackadaisical approach.  I think that as much or more effort should be spent on system robustness as program robustness because much of the error handling code I&#x27;ve seen at the program logic level is overly complicated and under-tested; when in doubt, call abort() and let the overall system sort things out (and design your system so that this approach works, check out Netflix&#x27;s Chaos Monkey).",1431102548

An airplane by it&#x27;s nature wants to fly, and if not interfered with too strongly by unusual events or by a deliberately incompetent pilot, it will fly. A helicopter does not want to fly. It is maintained in the air by a variety of forces and controls working in opposition to each other, and if there is any disturbance in this delicate balance the helicopter stops flying; immediately and disastrously. There is no such thing as a gliding helicopter.<p>This is why being a helicopter pilot is so different from being an airplane pilot, and why in generality, airplane pilots are open, clear-eyed, buoyant extroverts and helicopter pilots are brooding introspective anticipators of trouble. They know if something bad has not happened it is about to.&quot;<p>Harry Reasoner, Approach magazine, November 1973",1431101741

It&#x27;s no worse than free software without copyleft, and it opens up a revenue stream most projects decide to simply relinquish.",1431101224

I&#x27;m completely fine with that in terms of a home, I don&#x27;t need a massive kitchen and massive bedrooms etc. But I really wish I had a garden and a garage. If I had either of those I&#x27;d love to get into motorcycles. Without them, it just feels like my expensive toy is out there on the street and if anything ever happens to it, I can&#x27;t tinker away patiently, I pay a guy to fix it or rent a workspace and fix it on a timer.<p>I&#x27;ve watched a ton of videos on repairs and maintenance and modifications etc. I can&#x27;t imagine really enjoying it that much if that element is removed.<p>Beyond that I&#x27;d be pretty scared of riding a lot.

E.g. with this RULE you&#x27;ll get into trouble if &quot;id&quot; isn&#x27;t passed in as a explicit value, but uses a non-deterministic DEFAULT or directly passed in expression.  Every reference to NEW.id will not be replaced by the result of that expression, but rather with the expression itself.  For the common serial id column (aka autoincrement) you&#x27;ll have a separate nextval() call in each reference. Which can make this explode in pretty damn confusing ways.",1431101150

https://developer.linkedin.com/support/developer-program-transition<p>One of the major restrictions is limiting the access of the r_fullprofile fields to only explicit LinkedIn partners. This is used by a lot of startups to create a great onboarding UX and minimize user data entry.<p>While this is a disruption to developers who will now have to adapt their onboarding, more importantly, it&#x27;s a major setback for millions of LinkedIn users. LinkedIn is heightening their walls and there will no longer be an easy way for LinkedIn users to export their profile data out of LinkedIn and use it for other purposes.<p>We build an online resume/portfolio creation tool and are offering all our premium plans for free when users signup with LinkedIn until our API access to LinkedIn profiles gets turned off on May 12:

The typical ""stoner effect"" -- a phrase that sounds in some way deep or metaphysical causing susceptible people's neurons to flare, producing only the word: ""Woah...""

""Gears for go, brakes for slow""<p>Why this is so, I'm not entirely sure; it does mean that you can change from manual to auto transmission without thinking (and potentially without making a fatal mistake at speed if you are pursuing a suspect). However, it just shifts the cognitive effort of making sure you're always in the correct gear (which I think is also standard advice in eg. the roadcraft system).<p>From a professional owner / driver perspective (eg. a taxi), the answer is simple; brakes are cheap to replace, clutches aren't.<p>What they <i>really</i> don't tell you about are things like left foot braking (which I don't do) and heel-and-toe (which I do, especially when leaving motorways where we tend to have a junction followed by an uphill slip road).",1360681041

What if the mixing service operates like a checking account, and you keep a permanent bitcoin balance with them, making deposits as you receive bitcoin payments?  When you want to make a bitcoin payment, you instruct the service to make a transfer from its own bitcoin wallet, and reduce your balance in its own records accordingly.  With this method, incoming and outgoing payments would be asynchronous, so it would be hard to use timestamps to associate them.<p>The interesting thing here is that with bitcoin, a cash-like transaction may not be anonymous, but a check-like transaction usually would be.<p>Of course, the middleman institution could still be compromised here, but since it uses its own protocol to track its customers' balances, it could use one that does preserve anonymity effectively.",1360680908

Of his three suggestions, only the third (Intel providing improved board testing tools) even seems like it could possibly prevent this sort of problem. Asking for hardware-enforced ""sane"" behavior is like asking, ""why doesn't my computer know I don't want my program to deadlock, segfault, or loop indefinitely?"" That is, if the controller could do that then it would solve the Halting Problem. Improved drivers, his second suggestion, are always a good thing, but drivers only get patched to handle broken hardware in response to the discovery of broken hardware. There is no way to anticipate each particular way a NIC could possibly be broken ahead of time.<p>The market demands controllers with flexible and expandable functionality. Board manufacturers use the EEPROM to specify exactly what behavior is required. If a particular manufacturer underestimates the importance of correctness and doesn't perform the code review and testing necessary to prevent a PoD, that isn't Intel's fault.",1360680786

You say ""instead"", as if this were a choice between two alternatives.  This is known as the ""false dilemma"", and it is a logical fallacy.<p>2. It is not clear how to fix the problem about discrimination based on names on CVs/rsums, whereas the solution to bikinis in powerpoint slides is much simpler (delete the pictures from the slides, smartass).  To use a much abused phrase, this is low-hanging fruit.<p>3. You also assume that the issues are unrelated or isolated, and that (for example) showing inappropriate pictures of women at tech conferences does not cause people to discriminate against women on CVs/rsums, when it is very plausible that the pictures of women in bikinis normalize / contribute to the measurable acts of discrimination.<p>> Would anyone raise even an eyebrow if a woman sliped a sexy male model photo in a slide?<p>You think this is a clever argument, but it is not.

That's like saying ""the best entrepreneurs are women"" because when you compare data, female entrepreneurs grow their companies faster, with less risk, and are profitable sooner (all true facts, go ladies!). Yet when we look at startups and businesses we see men all over the place, at the top of billionaires lists, with massive companies, worldwide reach, huge patent portfolios.

The fact that it's intellectually engaging, or wildly surprising, or that it discharges an existing yet unspeakable tension. 95% of sexist jokes are neither of the two former. The ""fun"" in sexist jokes shared among brogrammers is that the group rolls itself into the most degrading mediocrity engendered by a frustrated-males-only-attendance, with nobody lecturing them that they ought to behave better, what with their over-education, supposedly progressive social views, genuine interest for the opposite sex etc.<p>To take just one example in the comments here, ""We are hiring fashion interns"" with underwear girl pictures is simply not funny: no intellectual stimulation, nothing comic nor original here. And it's neither about women (models or professionals) nor about underwear. It's about the crippling level of frustration admitted by making such a lame joke, and by laughing at it.<p>My empirical observation is that when a few women join a male professional setup, sexists jokes quickly vanish, not because people don't dare cracking them, but because they don't feel the need to tell them anymore (IMMV). It nevertheless remains half of a vicious circle keeping women out of some career paths, to the detriment of both genders.",1360679222

Most of the time, you don't need the flexibility that the extra indirection gives you. So you get complexity for little benefit.<p>If you don't need to hold state, then a collection of functions will usually suffice.

In the United States, the mildest playfulness during business hours and in a business setting is forbidden; in France, it is encouraged.

2619157,comment,2618270,2618380,2,0,flomo,,,"Disagree - the catalog business model was a proven quantity going back a century or more, e.g. Sears.

Despite this critical article, a more accurate survey of that era's business press would give the impression that Amazon.com was the ""good one"" compared to the Outpost.com like pump-n-dumps that were often nothing more than a few webservers. Maybe Amazon didn't get serious until the lean times, but the press hype was generally correct.<p>On the other hand, the Groupon business model has always been borderline. (I remember my parents buying these coupon books with deals like half-off steak dinner on Tuesdays before 8PM. How many of those companies are still around?)

2619156,comment,2618316,2618495,2,0,edtechdev,,,"You are correct that the Project Euler approach isn't well suited for learning to program, although I would qualify it with ""for some"", if not most - especially the less mathematically inclined, or those who care more about things like social or real-world problems.  You have to show programming and computer science as being more than just solving artificial puzzles or doing math & logic for its own sake.<p>It should be noted that this site and others have been around for 10 years, and in the meantime the number of people majoring in computer science has actually dropped (I think it finally turned upward this year though), and the proportion of female and minority students in computer science has actually dropped.  Notice too how the author of this article, the author of the project euler site, and, from what I can tell, everyone here is a guy.  Every article I read about 'why johnny can't program' and so forth are by guys, usually older folks who already understand the relevance of programming, but perhaps can't understand how it might not be so evident to others.  I know it took me a long time (almost ten years) to see it.  When I was first introduced to programming, to draw an American flag on the screen in BASIC, it was boring and pointless compared to the colecovision next to it :)  It wasn't until I created a CGI perl app for letter-writing with our amnesty international group and also a hypercard program for an HCI class that I dived in.<p>Teaching programming or computer science 'for its own sake' is not going to help most see the relevance of it to their lives and to the world.  Show how you can accomplish things with programming, how you can help people, and so forth.  Like someone else pointed out, the rosettacode site is similar, but at least it gives some more practical problems.<p>Also, there's the fact that computer science is not required in most schools, and thus, like engineering, most don't ever think to major in it or work in the field.",1307175650

Even most kickstarter projects (at least the successful ones I've seen) have managed to go out of their way to model a working prototype on their own.<p>D] This is probably the most likely answer... majority of the companies applying are very software/web/mobile centric. It's not that YC or other incubators are biased just like how they wish more women would start companies, but the market are mostly people focusing on ideas in the software/web/mobile space.<p>With that said, I realize it takes a lot more than 1-2 guys to prototype out an iPod, generally speaking. Afterall, Apple probably had a decent size team of experts working on the iPod for 1-2 years before the first product was introduced.<p>To be fair, there are some hardware base companies that did raise funding without a product but the ones I know of are usually backed by proven entrepreneurs (not saying that yet-to-be-proven entrepreneurs can't). Ooma is an example that comes to mind.<p>There are hackerspaces that do hardware development but I guess there just isn't as many hardware guys as there are software guys. Not to mention the barrier of entry is probably a lot harder (not just in time and cost but also in picking up hardware knowledge vs learning to program). From talking to my friend who graduated as an EE major, most hardware projects are very specialize and require multiple people to work on to produce where as software can be done with 1 guy building the prototype in most cases.",1307175520

Like Flash on touch devices iOS apps on a desktop or notebook makes little sense. No gyro, compass, gps, accelerometer.<p>Of course now that I said never Apple will announce a new line of super touch-enabled gyroscopic accelerometered displays. Shipping in September.<p>> Realtime, continuous syncing of iOS devices will mean never having to plug your iPhone or iPad in to your computer again, or even the need for a computer for syncing at all.<p>Better stay next to a wall charger.<p>Task level integration and continuous media play across devices would be really awesome. Fun list :)",1307174839

This now proven; government are not just bordering terrorism, they are engaging in terrorist acts through contracting fake security firms (which are then easy to point at when uncovered).

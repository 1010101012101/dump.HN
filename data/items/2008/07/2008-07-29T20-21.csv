261048,comment,260737,260737,0,0,akeefer,,,"I'm no fan of universities focusing just on Java programming either, but the contentions Dewar makes are completely ludicrous.  Either he's deliberately distorting things to make his point or he's completely out of touch with real-world engineering projects; Java is pretty much the main language for business programmers these days, and plenty of things like financial transaction systems are written in it, so saying it's only used in simple web applications is laughable.  A large percentage of people writing simple web-apps have moved on to Ruby and Python anyway, leaving Java to be used primarily for back-end enterprise systems.<p>Similarly, the idea of quizzing candidates on whether they can diagnose and track down compiler or processor bugs is similarly useless; there are far more critical skills to test for in an interview.  If I was interviewing someone for a position at a hardware company writing software for prototype chips, then I'd probably care; if the job was for about 98% of the other programming jobs in the world hardware knowledge is about 152nd on the list of things I'd care about.<p>It's hard to imagine how someone could take this guy as an authority on how universities should educate people and what job skills graduates will need when he's so obviously out of touch with the real world.",1217363652

These comments are mostly negative, but I hope you can take them constructively.  It's not a personal thing =) I'm trying to help you.<p>1.  Name.  Srsly?<p>2.  Color scheme.  Fix it.<p>3.  Why should I use this?  It creates a ""business plan"", but is it any better than the one I already made for my investors?  As a user, I want to know that you can either<p>A) add pretty pictures / make up for my lack of design skills<p>B) Suggest things I might have forgotten, or otherwise improve what I could write in word / google docs<p>C) Add some sort of 'social' element to business planning (e.g. sending it to a list of people I manage, commenting, something like that)<p>Otherwise, I have no reason to use your product.  You need to figure out what it is you are providing (i.e. value) and put it on the front page, where I can see it.<p>3a) Also, I want to see what the final result looks like.  Sample business plans!  Put the output formats in a bullet/feature list (PDF, hosted automagically, DOC, whatever it is you support, because i have no idea).<p>If I were a random user not reviewing your site, I would have left at this point.<p>5.  Why do you need an e-mail?  I didn't receive any ""Thanks for signing up!"" mail from you, so I'm assuming you're going to spam me with feature updates later?<p>6.  What is a strapline, and why is it italicized?<p>7.  I'm assuming the ""Author"" is me?  Don't you already have my name?  Didn't I type it in 10 seconds ago?<p>8.  What is drstunner and why is it autofilled in every box?<p>9.  Explanation text is a good idea.  Some of it appears to be voiced awkwardly.  Random example:  Why are those things ""drivers""?  Minor grammatical issues.  Yes, i am a grammar nazi.<p>10.  Asterisks.  So I'm expecting some type of markup?<p>11.  This autofilled text is really annoying.  At minimum it should clear when I click in the box.  Worse is the complete lack of grammar--my subconscious concern is one of these could end up in my final plan.<p>12.  I just realized that the stuff in the ""Notes"" green box has a section for each input field.  You need to move that somewhere next to the input field I'm working with.  Otherwise it's scroll-->type, scroll->type<p>13.  The Financials section is way simplistic.  Maybe I'm thinking about a subscription or advertising model, or maybe I charge for something that is sufficiently different than (or unrelated to) primary costs or users.  Imagine if eBay, or Google, or Mint were using your site.  I looked for a way to turn off this section (impossible) or use my own chart (also impossible).<p>14.  Trying to use the ""Plan"" section on the right for navigation... it's not in any sort of order.  I have no idea what section to go to 'next' in the flow.  Wait, why is this a flow again?  And why is the 'overview' the last stop?<p>15.  Ah, so it generates PDFs.  Twenty minutes later, I now know what your product does.<p>16.  And those PDFs look like crap.  Headings and normal text, aparrently.  In landscape format.  And advertisement for you on every page.  Investors will be signing up in droves once they learn that I used ""bzplnr"".<p>17.  The asterisks... are asterisks.<p>18.  Clicking ""generate..."" again gives me ""Matt Siegel's"" business plan, which is certainly not me, generating FUD about trusting you with my secret plan.<p>You need to look hard at 3/3a, which is where most people will leave.  What value are you providing?  Right now, the only value is the somewhat-helpful text that I didn't realize was associated with input fields until halfway through.  This app is one big form and you need to do some usability work here.  Filling out forms isn't fun for anyone, but your task is to figure out a way to make it fun.<p>The finished PDFs look like crap (I can't even do bullet points).  The lowest common denominator here is google docs-like markup.  The real performance metric is Word templates.  Until you at least support textile/markup/google docs styling, nobody's going to hand this PDF to an investor.  And you're not really going to see users until you surpass word templates.",1217362417

261016,comment,259748,260957,0,0,jacobolus,,,"No, Summers was not canned because of his comments about women in science (at least that was not the primary reason; it certainly didn’t help him out).  That was the whole point of this sub-thread.  “People” didn’t nail Summers for mentioning data: that is a straw-man mischaracterization of any serious part of the dispute with Summers, even of the dispute about women in science.  Summers did not give up on academia: he holds a University Professorship and teaches courses.<p>But more to the point, you are conflating three separate disputes, and trying to change the subject as a way to dodge my questions.  But again, this discussion is going nowhere, and is therefore pointless.<p>As for the National Review article, it adds no substance, and makes no attempt to engage with any of the discussion it supposedly disagrees with, and instead makes a classic troll argument of empty epithets.  It has no factual inaccuracies, because it not arguing facts. (Note: it does not take factual inaccuracies to make a stupid argument.)  It is garbage, because the only possible reactions to reading it are “Yeah, they’re right.  Those liberals <i>are</i> just useless elitist leeches on society,” or else “No, they’re wrong.  Studying how society works is important,” neither of which is a worthwhile reaction (e.g., “Hey! That article taught me something I didn’t already know,” or “Wow! That article really clarified that concept I was having trouble understanding.”).",1217362194

Mindmeister is an online collaboration tool that allows you to create mind maps - you know those charts where you’d circle an idea, then list related ideas, and keep branching away. You can share your “mind maps” with other users, and they can add to and edit your map. All revisions are tracked and can be easily undone.",1217362085

That's zero revenue for the owner, and zero use for me (as somebody looking for something).  I'm thinking that there is a nice middle ground where you can provide good value to the user, while still getting a fair number of click-throughs.  Spend the time to write up good content, have a halfway decent design, and then leave it with little maintenance over time.<p>Basically, I think I can do better than the sites I just checked out on sitepoint.<p>Feedback?

What the hell are you going to wait 4 years for? Do it now.<p>Quit your job and join a startup. There are probably a few in your area, and I'm sure a couple are using ASP or .Net, which is right up your alley. Working there will sort out a few of your learning finance & business issues.<p>Learn more skills on the side, and when you are ready (not 4 years dude), jump. In fact, jump with your own stuff as a means of learning. Learn while building.<p>You've got years before succeeding will really matter, to be honest.

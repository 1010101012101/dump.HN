571090,comment,570720,570720,0,0,geuis,,,"I interviewed with Facebook in March for a front-end developer role. It was an insulting experience. The tech screen was with some low-level engineer. The first(and only question before I hung up on him) was to write a function in javascript to return the square root of a number.<p>My answer in 15 seconds:
var sqr = function(e){
return Math.sqrt(e);
}<p>Easy enough. But no, he wanted a function that demonstrated an algorithm to find the square root. Ok... I said. I spent a minute trying to salvage some odd details from high-school algebra and basically came up blank. I was thinking, well this isn't going to look good on me. I readily admit to him that my knowledge of figuring out square roots by hand is a rusty, having been out of high school for 12 years(even though in retrospect, this was something we were never really even taught anyway). But surely this guy, who is screening me for my ability to do front-end coding, will move on and start asking me some hard problems about javascript, css, cross browser problems, etc. No.<p>We spend the next 6-8 minutes with him circling back on his square root problem. I tried a couple more times to answer this question that is <i>completely</i> unrelated to the job I'm interviewing for. Finally, I get so fed up with this moron that my internal ticker clicks over and I realize, ""Even if I get this job, I'm going to be dealing with these kinds of nazel-gazing engineers every single day. Not an environment I want to be in."" I thanked him for his time, and he acts surprised and says ""Are you sure? After everything it took to get to talk to me?"". Yes, I say. I'm quite sure. >Click.<<p>I realized a long time ago what kind of people these are. When I was growing up, the garbage truck would come by on Tuesdays and Thursdays. When we first moved to the neighborhood, we would put our garbage out by the mailbox and some days it would be picked up and sometimes not. We would complain and nothing would change.<p>After a few weeks, I was standing out front when they came by. I noticed that everyone had their trash bags on the right side of their mailboxes. That morning, I had done that as well. But some new neighbors down the street had put theirs out on the left side of their mailbox. The truck comes by, grubby guys grabbing/throwing, grabbing throwing. All the garbage gone, except for the neighbors. The next time, I purposely left ours on the left side. Didn't get picked up that day.<p>So that was the day that I realized these guys had their Line In The Sand. It was Their Way or the Highway. They had a really crappy job. Probably crappy lives at home because they're garbage men. This was Florida, not NYC. There's no glamor or high-pay there. This was the one place where they were the kings, the arbiters of Pickup Or Not. This was the one point of control over their lives they could influence, and they grabbed onto with both hands and some toes.<p>So this little middling engineer at Facebook had his Line too, in the form of a square root function that Had To Be ANSWERED! ""You shall not cross!"" He exclaims internally. I'm positive he was quite satisfied with himself after I hung up. Some self congratulation at keeping another peasant out of the castle halls. Kind of like the junk yard dog on a chain behind the fence. Smug in barking and keeping away the kids, but still chained to his dog house.",1240249648

The first signs something was up were the wheelchair ramps that appeared around Bridge Laboratory, the older physics building.  Hawking made his debut by giving the weekly physics colloquium talk in the large lecture room.  At that time, he could still speak well enough to give a lecture in his own voice (with a microphone), and he started into some brand new, mind boggling stuff about black holes evaporating.  The entire physics faculty was there, and I sensed he had zoomed over most their heads.  Most, but not all.  Feynman was sitting in the front row, and half way through, he asks a question.  It was the kind of question that reveals he was following along just fine.  The two titans proceeded to have a back and forth exchange for a few minutes in front of the assembled masses, and then Hawking continued with his talk.  It was awesome and humbling to witness that, and my friends and I, sitting way up in the back rows, just shook our heads.",1240248863

It's up to the readers to determine if Gabriel's examples actually demonstrate usefulness, but it doesn't help that you mischaracterize his examples. Here are some corrections:<p>1. Your summary doesn't even really make sense as a coherent thought. The author actually says that he showed up 8 hours early for a meetup and a friend told him of his mistake. IMO not wasting a lot of time wondering where everyone is is useful.<p>2. Gabriel never says anything about not being able to remember what he's doing, and your implication that he's a moron is pretty ridiculous. Incidentally, a lot of people use twitter this way.<p>3. In the article itself he mentions that someone gave a bug report over twitter.  Again, this is another common practice. Even if the author hasn't <i>yet</i> found any useful tweets (he has), he undoubtedly will in the future.<p>4. Your comment is ambiguous. Gabriel mentions that twitter is another tool for communicating with customers. Believe it or not, when people are interested in a product or service they like to get updates about it.<p>5. Gabriel doesn't use Twitter itself as an ice-breaker, but  others' tweets. ""Hey, nice to meet you. Yeah I started following you because of what you wrote about ninja turtles. I like ninja turtles too!""<p>6. ...<p>7. Completely inaccurate. Author wrote, ""I don't really have that many, <i>but with the amount I do have it is enough to get benefit when spreading news and links about my company or otherwise.</i>""",1240247932

571032,comment,570636,570766,0,0,briansmith,,,"It is harder to be a programmer now than in the old days because now you have to be an artist. 20 years ago every app looks horrible and so your horrible-looking app blended right in. Today, the designer that can barely code has a serious advantage over the programmer that can't design. It's a lot easier to learn how to program than it is to learn how to design beautiful things. With open source we can all copy each other's code but everybody will hate you if you copy another person's design.<p>Nowhere is this more evident than Android vs the iPhone. Android's design philosophy is all about utilitarianism. Accordingly, the G1 and most Android apps are incredibly ugly. If you install an ugly app on your G1 then nothing really changes. The iPhone is about design first, utility second. If you install an ugly app on your iPhone you've made it worse than it was without the app. Now, look at who is making money: iPhone developers creating eye candy, not Android developers building unique useful apps.",1240247681

The history of Detroit is one of several reasons why I don't take Paul's views on special role of SV seriously: Valley isn't something we haven't seen before. If anything, it is declining:<p>Valley startups no longer represent the cutting edge of computing innovation at large [as they did in the 80s], they have mostly escaped competition by hiding in relatively narrow niche of ""English-speaking consumer Internet"" very much like Detroit has been hiding behind big SUVs. And ""release early, release often"" web sites are no different from body-on-frame SUVs: their tech is so well understood and simple that Chinese can produce cheaper and faster copycats of facebooks and twitters in a matter of months within an original launch.<p>When they'll learn to market them properly, they will build their own data centers in San Antonio, TX and the similarity with Detroit will be complete.",1240247472

Another example is having the primitives auto-sort collections when searching to get nlogn complexity.  Almost any language can use these ideas.

Sure, initially it might look like some C code started printing out random data beyond the end of an array, but as I&#x27;ve started to study it, it really has started to make more sense to me to use this highly condensed form of programming. I&#x27;ve even begun to toy with the idea that the original creator of K uses wherein he hates scrolling, so all his code is organized into a few small files so that he doesn&#x27;t have to scroll any of them. At least one of the benefits of this kind of coding are that you can easily see and reference everything that is used, since your eyes only have to move a small distance and you don&#x27;t have to scroll 500 lines to see the definition of whatever you&#x27;re trying to look up. I also feel like it promotes a simplicity, due to it promoting dense, terse code, you really need to make sure what you&#x27;re writing is the simplest possible to fit into a small amount of text.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not saying you have to personally like something such as J.

8605687,comment,8601985,8604906,0,0,graycat,,,"I nearly posted my standard view of
<i>Fortune</i> but relented.  But with your
comment, here goes!  My view of <i>Fortune</i>
is that they have a <i>formula</i> for
such articles.<p>First glance, the article seems to be
to provide <i>information</i> to the readers,
say, as in &quot;this is what this really successful
guy does that you, the reader, might learn
from and find useful in your work in business&quot;.
But my view is that this first glance is
nearly totally wrong.<p>Instead the <i>formula</i> for the articles is
not to provide useful, or even very solid, 
information at all.  Instead, the <i>formula</i>
is a manipulation of the reader:  The reader
is made to feel good about themselves.<p>How?  The article makes the subject&#x27;s work
look simple, definitely like the reader
can easily see themselves doing the same.  Then the
reader feels like they are on the right track,
that is, already doing as well as the 
subject of the article.  So, the article passes
out a lot of simplistic <i>insights</i>, cliches,
trivialities, etc. that any reader can agree
that they could have done.<p>Really
it is best for the formula if the 
reader comes away learning
nothing at all; that is, part of the formula
is to make the reader conclude that they
are already on the right track, already 
know as much as the subject in the article,
could easily do just what the subject does,
and, thus, are on the way also to being worth
billions.  So, a main goal is that the reader
learn nothing!<p>So, are making the reader feel good by confirming
that the simplistic thoughts that they can
easily already have really are the right stuff.<p>Or, such an article is <i>vicarious, escapist, fantasy,
emotional experience entertainment</i> (VEFEEE).<p>And that&#x27;s the article.  The formula is to
manipulate the reader into coming back for
more, thinking that, &quot;I&#x27;m reading <i>Fortune</i>
and, thus, learning from the best Captains of
Business; oh, oh, oh, I&#x27;m learning so much;
and, since these guys are worth billions,
I can be, too.&quot;.<p>I concluded all this long ago.  I am surprised to
see <i>Fortune</i> still following the same old
formula.  Heck, I kept reading to the end just
to see if they had any significant content
beyond their old formula -- they didn&#x27;t.<p>So, net, I gave up on <i>Fortune</i> for years, and
now I&#x27;ll give up on the Web version for more
years!  What a big pile of nutten, deliberately,
very carefully crafted, total nutten!<p>&quot;Thoughtless&quot; you say!  How kind you are!",1415936099

If a cable company has to put more money building the network in rural areas than what it can recover from it, it makes a much greater sense for that cable company to partner with someone like Google or Netflix or Facebook, share the cost and then give preferential bandwidth to these providers. That way it is a win win situation.<p>The best example to illustrate the point is that of India. A desperately poor and rural country. In 2001, Indian government came up with the law that any telecom company that wants to provide telecom service in any city/town must also provide coverage in the rest of the &quot;district&quot;. Consequence ? Other than handful large cities telecom companies failed to to expand. They were not interested in bidding for any telecom licenses.<p>When government abolished that clause, it turned out to be a telecom revolution in India.",1415935974

8605623,comment,8604489,8605586,0,0,agentultra,,,"The point I was trying to make is that developing a game from scratch is a labor-intensive way to make a game. You have to consider file paths, resource management, texture packing, file formats, parsers, and hardware. You have to think about abstract things like event processing, concurrency, simulation, reacting to inputs, etc. A mountain of work goes into lighting up a pixel on the screen. Doing it from scratch is essentially inventing the universe from the atoms up.<p>I like this kind of stuff.<p>However there are projects where I&#x27;m more interested in game play mechanics, art, music, and experience. I can still write my own shaders. I still write all of my own behaviors, AI, and controllers. But with an engine I don&#x27;t have to worry about animation blending, input control, hardware platform differences, asset tooling, etc, etc, etc, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone who is curious. I just wanted to push back against some of the nostalgia in the video. It&#x27;s not all glamorous. I&#x27;ve spent my share of my youth slavering over cryptic compiler errors. Developing games then wasn&#x27;t as much fun as it is today, IMO. It was different and unique in its own way. But the tools we have today are far, far better.",1415934243

8605621,comment,8601985,8604941,0,0,graycat,,,"> Search, on the other hand, still has massive room for improvement.<p>Broadly agree.<p>For what Google does in search, say, first-cut, 
keywords/phrases and results sorted by
a measure of gross popularity, <i>page rank</i>,
and date (but, for a second-cut, clearly 
now with a lot of refining tweaks), it seems
to me that they are doing a terrific job.<p>But as far as I can tell, Bing is doing
about the same.<p>So, if are looking for something, have a few
keywords/phrases that fairly accurately 
characterize what want, then Google/Bing
can work well.  They can be just terrific.   
But that scenario does at
best poorly on a significant fraction of
(&quot;safe for work&quot;) search.<p>For this fraction, there are a lot of approaches,
Web sites, etc. but nothing very good.<p>For this fraction, I worked out some new
techniques and wrote the corresponding software.<p>For where Google/Bing work well, and often they
are just terrific, my work will usually
not be as good and only occasionally better.<p>But for nearly all of the fraction of &quot;at best poorly&quot;,
my work should be quite good and much
better than anything else.  My work is
different, very different, and I believe that
being so different is necessary
(clearly not sufficient) for success in
the fraction I am attacking.<p>Currently I&#x27;m loading some initial data.  Then ...,
maybe people will like it.<p>Of course, with all the usual start-up advice,
my work is doomed to fail because I&#x27;m 
a <i>solo founder</i> if don&#x27;t count my kitty
cats!  And, I&#x27;m not a college dropout.
I didn&#x27;t even drop out of grad school and
did get my Ph.D.  And I&#x27;m past 30.  So,
right, doomed!<p>But being successful at what I&#x27;m attempting
would be <i>exceptional</i>; so we have to expect
that much of my project is not the usual.
So be it.  I have some fairly good reasons
to believe that my work should be successful;
no way am I doing this just &quot;on a wing and
a prayer&quot;.<p>What do you think?  Announce a private beta
test here on HN?  Get feedback?  Get it
working well.  Polish the UI/UX.  Go live,
get more publicity, run ads, grow?",1415934204
8605620,comment,8604586,8605032,0,0,dang,,,"> it appears it was only available during error<p>Yes, for two different meanings of &quot;error&quot;. I wonder if this ambiguity is part of what was confusing, so let me disambiguate.<p><i>There was a programming error in some error-handling code.</i> If that makes sense, you can skip the following.<p>The first kind of error was a bug in our code. The API code is <i>never</i> supposed to send info to Firebase that you couldn&#x27;t get by scraping the public website. Unfortunately, we wrote a line of code that (in a totally non-obvious way, which is why it got past both testing and code review) broke this rule.<p>The buggy line of code happened to live inside an exception handler. That is, it was only ever executed when a runtime error occurred. That&#x27;s the second type of error we&#x27;re talking about. An example might be a network timeout. These are infrequent, so the buggy code only ran infrequently.<p>Had the bug been in the happy path, testing would have caught it right away. In this case, though, even testing the error path didn&#x27;t catch it, because certain other (basically random) conditions had to happen in order for the buggy code to leak the data. That&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t know about it until Ovidiu told us.",1415934191

I finally realized they must have meant cores: so 4 cores x 18 servers x 16 cartridges = 912 cores per case is probably how I would have put it.<p>Ballparking the size of the case based on the comparison of a single server to a business card, it looks like they&#x27;re using roughly a 7U case. Anybody know more about the specs of a case-load of servers? I&#x27;d love to know what the power consumption is. If you could put 6 of those cases in a cabinet, that would be some pretty incredible compute density.<p>I hope they consider selling the system externally. At first blush at least it seems like it would be an ideal setup for hosting colocated trading applications.",1415934176

He really was an exceptional human being.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate his disillusionment led him to leave math completely, and slowly retreat out of society, and probably to develop the mental illness that dominated his later life.

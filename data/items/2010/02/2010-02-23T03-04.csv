Imagine you know <i>a-priori</i> that the image was generated simply by placing a few white circles against a black background. Then data was lost/discarded, and white noise was added to the remaining data.<p>(The white circles are cross sections of the patient's blood vessels or some such feature (bile ducts, in this case), and contain a contrast agent. The contrast agent appears white on the MRI, everything else appears black. )<p>Now that you know the pixel image has such a simple form, you don't need to do fancy noise removal to clean it up. All you need to do is figure out where the white circles are. Once you know where the are, you can just redraw the image based on your calculated locations of circles instead of reprocessing the old one.<p>You can play the same trick in k-space, which gives you a potent MRI reconstruction algorithm.<p>In practice, this doesn't work as well for more complicated images such as brains or abdomens. There is just much more to draw, and the images cease to be sparse.",1266896965

1144561,comment,1144418,1144481,0,0,jmillikin,,,"I don't understand how people keep failing to understand monads. Maybe it's the line noise operator `>>=' ?<p>Lets define a simple type, `Maybe', which can store either a value or an absence of value:<p><pre><code>  data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
    deriving (Show)
</code></pre>
And define a function which compares a number against a limit, and returns `Nothing' if the value is out of range:<p><pre><code>  clamp :: Ord a => a -> a -> Maybe a
  clamp limit x = if x > limit then Nothing else Just x
</code></pre>
Easy enough. Now, how should the number be compared against multiple limits?<p>One way is to just brute-force it:<p><pre><code>  multiclamp :: Ord a => a -> a -> a -> Maybe a
  multiclamp lim1 lim2 x = case clamp lim1 x of
    Nothing -> Nothing
    Just x' -> clamp lim2 x'
</code></pre>
But this is ugly. Lets use monads to simplify it.<p>First, take a look at the core Monad operations. I'm going to use `build' and `bind' instead of `return' and `>>=', because they're probably more familiar to most readers.<p><pre><code>  class Monad m where
    build :: a -> m a
    bind :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
</code></pre>
Next, we'll define an instance of the `Monad' typeclass for `Maybe'. It will use the same semantics as the `multiclamp' example -- that is, if the first test returns `Nothing', the entire computation will return `Nothing':<p><pre><code>  instance Monad Maybe where
    build x = Just x

    bind Nothing  _ = Nothing
    bind (Just x) f = f x
</code></pre>
Using this definition, `multiclamp' can be written thus:<p><pre><code>  multiclamp2 :: Ord a => a -> a -> a -> Maybe a
  multiclamp2 lim1 lim2 x = bind
    (clamp lim1 x)
    (\x' -> clamp lim2 x')
</code></pre>
Although ugly, this notation is sufficiently generic that the compiler can generate it from an imperative notation. Lets look at two more examples. First, `multiclamp2' written using ""real"" monads. Notice that this is exactly the same as before, except `bind' is an operator named `>>=':<p><pre><code>  multiclamp3 :: Ord a => a -> a -> a -> Maybe a
  multiclamp3 lim1 lim2 x =
    (clamp lim1 x) >>=
    (\x' -> clamp lim2 x')
</code></pre>
And finally, using the imperative-style `do' notation. Note that although this is imperative, it is <i>not</i> impure -- this is semantically equal to `multiclamp3':<p><pre><code>  multiclamp4 :: Ord a => a -> a -> a -> Maybe a
  multiclamp4 lim1 lim2 x = do
    x' <- clamp lim1 x
    clamp lim2 x'
</code></pre>
This is, obviously, a superficial example -- you'd never see such verbose code in code written by an experienced programmer. But the verbosity helps to visualize what the compiler is doing.<p>For completeness, here's a ""cleaner"" version, which takes advantage of currying and the combinator `.':<p><pre><code>  multiclamp5 :: Ord a => a -> a -> a -> Maybe a
  multiclamp5 lim1 lim2 = (clamp lim2 =<<) . clamp lim1</code></pre>",1266896668

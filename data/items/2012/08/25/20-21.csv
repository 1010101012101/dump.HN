I am fairly certain that acquihires who just took home $1-2M in comp will survive your browbeating about not swinging for the fences.<p>> <i>""Not enough people moving to the Valley or coming out of school want to work at companies other people are starting, because its so easy to start their own.""</i><p>No, no it isn't. We are now at the point where SF/SV companies are offering $100K to fresh undergrads. For all that the industry has done to lower the barrier to entry for entrepreneurship, it is anything but trivial. A fresh grad shouldering a moderately scary debt load is <i>not</i> going to trivially choose to found a startup over taking a highly-paid position and paring down the debt.<p>How easy does the author think it is to live in SF/SV, work on a startup full-time, fresh out of college, loan payments due, with no income stream? Does she think everyone's a trust fund baby that can afford the $2K SF apartment and just spend all day drinking Blue Bottle while twirling their startup ideas in their heads, right out of school?",1345928387

4433246,comment,4431382,4431448,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I'm exactly the opposite. I don't have any strong feelings about patents but I'm fully aware that they're abused. That said, it was plain to me that Samsung was wrong and really did copy Apple. However, even if I thought Apple was plainly wrong which I have many times in the past I wouldn't think twice about buying their products and developer for their OS. I don't develop or buy Apple's products because of their corporate behavior. I do so for two reasons:<p>1. Apple products are the best in quality, design, and utility <i>for me</i>.<p>2. Their platform is hugely profitable and I want in on the action.<p>For me, it's simple economics. But I also tend to be an oddball around here. I'm one of the few who sees the benefits of copyright and I also believe patents have a completely valid place in society. What I think really sets me apart in these views is that I'm not a hard liner about any of them and from what I've seen on HN for the past 3 years, most people here (at least the ones who comment on these issues) are. I know about the dark side of patents, their abuse, and I'm right on the same page as others when they come out against abuse of the patent system. I also see some of the insanity surrounding copyright too. But you have to consider <i>all</i> the information in order to make an informed decision. Because of this I'm not one of those who decides to boycott all things made by company X because of their actions or position (could be one or a history of them) on issue Y.<p>I don't understand why people such as yourself take to boycotting every time something like this happens. I truly don't, and I'm not trying to be snarky or dickish at all so please don't read it that way. What I see in this case is standard Apple behavior and coincidentally they just happen to be right on this. If this abandoning of Apple really is about the lawsuit then why didn't you jump ship from the start instead of waiting for the ruling? And if this really is about the patent system then why is everyone making it about Apple? Apple is using the tools at its disposal to protect itself and in other cases simply make sure they stay ridiculously profitable. Apple didn't invent the patent system. If anger belongs anywhere it should be directed toward the system not the user of the system.",1345927937

Having an office in Menlo Park, Palo Alto, or Mountain View is a good compromise on commute time for all of these groups.<p>- Individual offices require much more space per employee, and isolate people. Facebook has chosen to build offices on open plan, which they see as better for their culture, collaboration, and internal communication.<p>- Putting an office in a downtown area requires parking, and most of the Bay Area ""downtowns"" can't cope with 6000+ cars from a single company without major parking expansion.<p>- Keeping all of this in mind, renting office space in a downtown area would require either purchasing an entire building to fit enough people (if such a building even exists), renovating it, providing parking for 6000+ people, plus all of the other logistical issues that come with working in a downtown area. SF/Bay Area isn't NYC and isn't optimized for non-car commuting.<p>- Office parks provide many other benefits for companies like Facebook, Apple, Google, etc. They can keep all of their employees (and their NDA-covered communications) absolutely private. They can provide many services at the campus that subtly convince employees to stay at/near the office longer. They can provide large food service areas, keeping employees at the office for lunch/dinner, and keeping their conversations within the businesses walls.<p>Building out an office park provides easy access to freeways, lots of (free) parking, cheaper utility costs, and easier construction/modification costs. Renovating an office park is going to be less expensive, in general, that completely gutting and renovating a skyscraper.<p>- At a company the size of Facebook an office park is the only thing that makes sense.",1345926432

Before 10.6.8, you simply couldn't boot a Mac Pro without an official card or card reflashed with EFI firmware.<p>Now, I haven't had an Apple official or reflashed card in my Mac Pro in a year and I use it every day, including right now.

Curiously, it isn't the situations where only 1 path is available where I lose. It is the situations when two somewhat equal paths exists, and I hesitate. At areas with white blocks, where the jumping height required to reach the next block is maxed, and the next block is horizontally displaced, there's very little time to think.<p>Hitting springs are the worst, as it changes the screen very rapidly, making it very hard to assess the situation (3 losses to this). The next worst is a series of whites at max height, which results in a high upwards speed (1 loss to this). Last loss was due to dropping a bag of chips.",1345925269

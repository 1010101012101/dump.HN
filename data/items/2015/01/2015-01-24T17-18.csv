8940335,comment,8940232,8940232,0,0,mholt,,,"This post may draw up a lot of criticism, but if nothing else, kudos to the author for implementing a crypto scheme to understand how it works and for encouraging others to examine and learn.<p>Now, that isn&#x27;t to say that we should actually use this library (as-is). You know, don&#x27;t roll your own crypto for real use. With this particular algorithm, you&#x27;re putting a lot of faith in the RNG, and it&#x27;s easy to miss that you need a huge key (or lots of small ones).<p>Finally, the claim that it&#x27;s &quot;unbreakable, even in theory&quot; (which comes from the Wikipedia article) to me seems a bit misleading -- isn&#x27;t the theory usually stronger than any particular implementation?

A really awesome (it seems to me for now) plugin for Apple Mail that enables tags. But before that I wondered if I haven&#x27;t missed anything and will regret spending the money. I&#x27;d love to use something that I know will be there in 10-20 years rather than pretty and trendy software products like Sparrow... as they all have the same fate - either aqcuired or abandoned. 
I saw this the other day in the app store - http://www.handle.com/
Looks great! But I doubt it will exist in 2 years.
Mailbox seems good but it&#x27;s owned by Dropbox and that makes me slightly uncomfortable.
But I still want something that looks good... and I also love tags/labels which are supported unfortunately only by Gmail and MailTags for Apple Mail.
So I don&#x27;t know if I can switch to something like Mutt.<p>So what does HN use?",1422122237

8940323,comment,8939333,8939333,0,0,jarin,,,"I actually tried LSD a couple of times because of this article, back when it was written. It was a pretty enjoyable experience, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying it, with a few caveats.<p>First, you need to have an experienced sitter with you. You&#x27;re in for the full 8-10 hours, and on the off chance you start having a bad trip (things getting really dark and scary), you need someone to ground you to reality (and change the music or location, which can often instantly snap you out of a mood).<p>Second, if you&#x27;re generally comfortable with your own thoughts and have a positive outlook you&#x27;re much less likely to have a bad trip. This is why I think it&#x27;s better to do it when you&#x27;re older and more mature, rather than in your late teens/early twenties. I think you have more of an ability to process what&#x27;s going on. Many people have the thought at some point during the trip, &quot;What if I get stuck like this?&quot; which can probably lead to a slight panic if you&#x27;re not good at thinking about your own thoughts and realizing the feeling for what it is.<p>Third, go out into nature if you can. Preferably with just your friends and not a lot of people around. It&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>Finally, the day after you&#x27;ll feel somewhat drained and probably just want to stay inside and read. The day after, you&#x27;re totally fine. I think the real long-term effects are kind of just a &quot;tweaking of the dials&quot;. I don&#x27;t feel like it was some super transformative experience, but it was really interesting in a way that&#x27;s hard to describe, and you learn a lot about your own mind and how it works. I also feel like it kind of cleaned the windows on the way I see the world, in that I feel more positive and open to ideas, and in some ways I feel like I might be more creative now. It might sound hard to believe, but I understand now why they&#x27;re researching using hallucinogens to treat depression, PTSD, etc.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not encouraging anyone to do it, but I will say that emotionally mature people should not be afraid to do it. Also, I never got any kind of signs that it was addictive. I pretty much just did it once, did it a few months later, and that was it for me.",1422122187

8940321,comment,8939333,8939623,0,0,danenania,,,"LSD seems to disproportionately affect the mind&#x27;s capacity to visualize complex systems and relationships, so even if you aren&#x27;t being all that novel or insightful in your thinking, the ability to really <i>see</i> what you&#x27;re pondering in a larger and more detailed way than you&#x27;ve ever experienced can feel like an incredible aha moment, even if you haven&#x27;t actually figured anything out. The glamor of the vision can be seductive.<p>Another issue is that it can be very difficult to stay focused long enough to transcribe what you&#x27;re experiencing mentally in any sort of comprehensible way. Just as you&#x27;re a few words into your description of a vast and intricate concept, 5 completely new ones come rolling in.<p>Not that I&#x27;m any sort of expert, but the solution seems to be various forms of mental discipline. Meditation and trying to remain a dispassionate observer (versus an impassioned epiphany seeker) can help to slow things down and make the experience less chaotic.",1422122137

8940315,comment,8939194,8940107,0,0,Robadob,,,"This article[1] links to various sources which cite different values.  Of those, this report[2] (research funded by US Department of Labour) states in it&#x27;s summary (page 35);<p><i>&quot;Specifically, variables have been developed to represent career interruption among workers with specific gender, age, and number of children. Statistical analysis that includes those variables has produced results that collectively account for between 65.1 and 76.4 of a raw gender wage gap of 20.4 percent, and thereby leave an adjusted wage gap that is between 4.8 and 7.1 percent.&quot;</i><p>My personal opinion is that there may be a slight gap, research that conservatively accounts for factors rather than assuming the difference is 100% gender-pay do tend to put it below 10%, however there just isn&#x27;t enough hard evidence to account for all the variables which may cause such a gap, so finding an accurate value isn&#x27;t possible. Each side of the debate will always find the most attractive figures to support their agenda, as can be seen by people quoting 20%+ raw wage gap analysis that doesn&#x27;t account for difference in time worked etc, and others misreading statistics to say that it&#x27;s lower than reported.<p>--------------------------

When salaries are not public, there is just one factor that influences them, that is, the value that the company puts on that employee and the fear of losing him/ her to a better offer. On the other hand, it&#x27;s much easier for the company to reject a request for a pay rise because it might upset other employees.

8940270,comment,8938647,8940196,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Okay, there&#x27;s some kind of failure to communicate, and the frustration level is rising.  The failure is probably on my end, so I apologize.<p><i>In either case, you&#x27;ll end jumping all over memory for the actual items in either a std::vec or a linked list, since they are both holding pointers to the actual objects (and based on how the nodes are being created, the linked list containers are closer in memory to the nodes).
That said, my premise was not that linked lists were faster to iterate over, it&#x27;s that they offer a consistent addition/removal time, which is frequently better for a game engine than access with huge deviations.</i><p>CPU caching doesn&#x27;t work like that.  When you access any pointer, the CPU cache will automatically cache 256 bytes from the access address.  So if your object is at address &quot;x&quot;, everything from [x, x+256) will be put into the CPU cache.<p>Your Projectile class contains 6 floats, so each Projectile is 24 bytes.  When you&#x27;re using std::vector, all of your projectiles are stored contiguously in memory.  That means when you access a projectile, you&#x27;ll automatically cache (256 bytes / sizeof(Projectile) - 1) = the next 9 projectiles.  So you get a bunch of performance for free, simply by using vector.<p>When you use list, you lose all of that caching.  The reason is because list&#x27;s memory allocations are all over the place.  When you use list, the memory region [x, x+256) is solely that <i>one</i> projectile.  That means your CPU will end up caching a bunch of irrelevant bytes of memory.  That also means the CPU will have to cache <i>each projectile individually</i> as they&#x27;re accessed.  You&#x27;re trading automatic caching of 10 projectiles for having to cache each individual projectile.  Since taking advantage of CPU caching gives you 10x or 100x speedups, that&#x27;s a very bad tradeoff.<p>Addition/removal from a container is a tiny, tiny fraction of tininess of what a modern game engine does.  It&#x27;s so tiny that add/removal performance is almost always irrelevant unless you&#x27;re adding/removing a huge number of elements every frame, which is rare.  Iteration performance is almost the only thing that matters for a game engine, because every single frame you&#x27;ll be iterating over hundreds of containers.  If each iteration causes your CPU cache to thrash, then you&#x27;re in for a world of pain.<p>The takeaway is that list is an <i>awful</i> choice for any realtime game, and it&#x27;s dangerous to give the impression that it&#x27;s better.  If someone were to take your tests at face value and start using list in their own game engines, a few months later they&#x27;re going to be wondering why their performance is so terrible and why their profilers aren&#x27;t showing the cause.  As far as performance characteristics go, memory fragmentation / CPU caching matter so much that discounting them is a recipe for disaster.<p><i>There are many games out there which boast 100+ FPS on my gaming computer. However, they still look like crap because they will have intermittent drops to 1 or even .5 fps. I (and many others) would prefer a constant 50 (or 30) FPS than a stuttering 140.</i><p>Agreed!  But list vs vector isn&#x27;t the cause.  A lot of the stuttering has to do with loading resources from disk, flushing the GPU pipeline, or other I/O intensive actions.  On a modern CPU, add/removals from containers aren&#x27;t the reason for the slowdown.<p>Either way, good luck, and keep on making cool stuff.",1422121246

8940238,comment,8939714,8939714,0,0,eric_khun,,,"&quot;I am not a lawyer or CPA and this is not legal advice. It is for general guidance only. You should work with an attorney and a CPA for specific professional advice.<p>If you&#x27;re American, this gets really sticky. The US taxes you on your worldwide income. If you have a US corporation, it is also taxed on worldwide income, so it can be double taxed. And foreign corporations in the US are taxed on US-sourced income.<p>However, there is a loophole. If you own a company outside the US, and the company earns money outside of the US, it&#x27;s only taxed in the US when the money comes back into the US. So, many people have companies registered abroad (Hong Kong is a popular jurisdiction) and money earned offshore is accrued in the foreign corporation. Expenses abroad are also paid by the foreign corporation. So, you can effectively avoid the money being double taxed (paying personal income tax only) if you earn money offshore and your offshore corporation pays your salary.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re working abroad, it&#x27;s not a vacation. A lot of things you spend money on are legitimately considered business expenses. So, if something is a business expense, pay for it with company earnings that haven&#x27;t been taxed.<p>Now, what about paying income tax in the jurisdiction where you were living abroad? Typically, countries only tax income sourced within the country, and many countries have tax treaties where income is only taxed once. So, for example, if you&#x27;re living in China, a country that has a tax treaty with the US, and you&#x27;re paid by a company outside of China, and you pay taxes in the US, you don&#x27;t actually have to pay taxes in China. Technically you are supposed to file there (at least in Beijing), but this isn&#x27;t actually enforced unless you&#x27;re on a Z-type visa and you are working for a Chinese company. And, if you&#x27;re on a tourist visa pretty much anywhere in the world, you won&#x27;t owe any tax in the country you were visiting. As best I know, no country in the world charges tourists income tax!<p>One thing that WILL happen if you&#x27;re living abroad, and have foreign bank accounts: You will get audited if you claim tax exemptions that apply when you live outside the US. In my case, this came in the form of a letter to my Chinese address which basically said &quot;prove you&#x27;re really living in China,&quot; and gave me a list of documents to supply as evidence of same. There was a list of 8 or so things, of which I had to supply 3. I just sent the IRS everything on the list (not only 3 of the things, but all of the things), mailed the package from Beijing, and I never heard from them again. I think they just wanted to make sure I really was living abroad.&quot;<p>edit : this comment come from here <a href=""http://nomadforum.io/t/what-is-the-tax-situation-for-perpetual-travelers-like/186/13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nomadforum.io/t/what-is-the-tax-situation-for-perpetu...</a><p>These links might be really helpful :

More generally, the FRE and the FRCP are really amenable to the sort of system analysis that comes naturally to engineers.<p>[Warning: severe geekery ahead]<p>E.g. consider 28 U.S.C. 1446, which governs when a case filed in state court can be removed to federal court by the defendant. Not all cases are removable--the case can be heard in federal court only if federal jurisdiction exists. However, cases are removed immediately upon filing a notice of removal--if the plaintiff contests federal jurisdiction, she has to file a motion to remand in the federal court.<p>Why do it this way instead of having filing a motion to remove in the state court and waiting for a decision on whether the case is removable? Because it decreases the latency of the whole procedure to let things get going in federal court and figuring out after the fact whether removal was proper. Usually, removal will have been proper and no remand will be necessary. This sort of pattern should be familiar to any engineer--this is exactly what a CPU does when it predicts a taken branch, starting execution of the branch target before resolving the branch condition. It decreases the latency of the branch, and because mispredicts are rare, the CPU rarely has to flush the speculatively-executed instructions.",1422120488

If you&#x27;re lucky and the correct memory row is already open, then you&#x27;ll wait 10ns for a memory request to complete, but you will regularly wind up waiting 20 or 30ns if you need to open or precharge+open a row -- and that&#x27;s assuming that there are no refresh cycles blocking the request. This adds up to a lot of inches when you multiply by 6in/ns, not to mention a lot of CPU die area to optimally order memory requests & refreshes (you can have one in-flight per bank).<p>You&#x27;re right that light <i>should</i> be the limiting factor, though. It has long seemed to me that we need to undergo a DRAM->SRAM shift analogous to the HDD->SDD shift. Drop the capacities a bit (factor of ~6 from 6 transistors/cell vs 1 transistor/cell?) in exchange for speed. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason why it&#x27;s not happening (energy efficiency?), but I&#x27;m an industry outsider and have no idea what it is.

In such an example, the article fails to mention the USD would depreciate and GDP would skyrocket(denominated in the dollars would go up, because about half of S&P500 revenues are foreign). The net effect would be a drastic lowering of debt and increase in GDP, thus somewhat fixing the debt-to-GDP ratio and largely fixing the high interest rates.<p>Of course we should pay down our debt when(or if<i>) it makes sense to do so: when unemployment is low and inflation is close to target (or above target). Now is not the time. Additionally, structural government reform is sorely needed, although it should target more outstanding issues, rather than an out-of-context debt number.<p></i> If secular stagnation holds true, we may not have &quot;normal&quot; interest rates again.",1422119264

So Core OS has better management tools for things like Docker. Ubuntu Core is missing both parts and it seems better for embedded systems than for cluster management IMHO.

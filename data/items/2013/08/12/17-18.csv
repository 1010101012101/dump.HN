Having worked in .NET web shops there is a tendency to be very back-end (and .NET) oriented and not really having a lot of deep expertise in the web, particularly on the front-end. I don&#x27;t want to assume this (the author mentioned UX and some other things which tends to lead me to believe they do have this kind of expertise). There is also a tendency to avoid technologies that can make working with the web easier. I&#x27;m talking about things like Ember or Angular, build tools like Grunt or some kind of asset pipeline for work so javascript can be more organized and structured and you can write less of it.<p>In the end web development on the .NET platform (can be) is harder and front-end development doubly so. I&#x27;ll admit this is my experience so YMMV.<p>In the author&#x27;s defence though I agree Javascript, when compared with many other languages, particularly Java or C# is often unwieldily, there is little help for how code is structured or organized and architecture of any sort is more challenging. That said it can be done, just not the way you might be used to in a more OOP C# or Java.",1376330304

6200601,comment,6199319,6199319,16,0,linvin,,,"The crux.<p>Tagore: &quot;According to Indian Philosophy there is Brahman, the absolute Truth, which cannot be conceived by the isolation of the individual mind or described by words but can only be realized by completely merging the individual in its infinity. But such a Truth cannot belong to Science. The nature of Truth which we are discussing is an appearance  that is to say, what appears to be true to the human mind and therefore is human, and may be called maya or illusion.&quot;<p>Indian philosophy has long held that there is no individual consciousness, but something encompassing the whole:\n- Knowledge is just that, knowledge, and it just exists; like numbers, pythagorous theorem etc. \n- Reality (as consumed by human mind) is result of senses interacting with that knowledge, and producing the illusion of individual. More importantly, it creates &quot;observed knowledge&quot;.\n- The relationships within observed knowledge, which are uncovered by mathematics. Observed knowledge &quot;shadows&quot; the reality, but at no point can we say that observed knowledge is exactly same as reality.\n- Exactly as we can manipulate the information in computer, the observed knowledge itself can be manipulated. For example, one could add a new &quot;sense&quot; and thus sense the reality in wholly new manner.<p>So, if anybody says &quot;There is an entity independent of the observed reality, and thus can manipulate it independent of the rules of that reality&quot;, then they are merely creating another observed reality.<p>But then, Indian philosophy further goes ahead and says the consciousness is independent of all this, and therefore, it will forever be creating newer and newer experiences out of the contents of the reality.<p>So if you identify yourself with brain, all you are saying is that &quot;it is simply not possible to derive any more knowledge other than what senses + mathematics give us&quot;.<p>Instead, if you identify yourself as an entity independent of knowledge itself, then at least there is possibility of finding out if there is an ultimate reality much beyond the brain, and most important, it should &quot;free you&quot; from the bodily limitations.<p>And hence in India (in particular, the Advaita philosophy) they say, you are &quot;Brahman&quot;, i.e. you are yourself God, but you mis-identify yourself as body and brain.<p>(As an aside, if you come to India, check out the religious channels and listen to Gurus talking there. Most of them convey this very philosophy to its very core!)",1376330264

6200590,comment,6199857,6200386,8,0,lispm,,,"No, Lisp Machines came out of the assumption that there was no hardware to run AI development environments as personal workstations. The concept of the Lisp Machine dates back to the early seventies and the first machines appeared mid/end seventies.<p>Lisp developers early on wanted to use the machines interactively. A single Lisp developer could use a PDP with something like Macsyma, which probably was thought to serve tens or hundreds of terminal users. And the memory of that machine was still constraining for Macsyma or some of the other larger Lisp programs.<p>At that time there were no useful 32bit (or more) microprocessors. Other machines were either tiny or very large for multiple users. The 68000 appeared in 1979 and just was good enough to run the console of the Symbolics Lisp Machine a few years later.<p>So Lisp Machines were developed to run a very compact machine code representation of Lisp and with very large main memories (1 Megabyte or more), graphical user interfaces and all that for a SINGLE user - a $100k per machine.<p>Thus when they appeared on the commercial market in 1981, there was nothing like it.<p>Ten years later lots of other processors were fast enough, had enough memory, and were available as capable personal computers or workstations. But initially &#x27;general purpose&#x27; hardware was not especially good at running Lisp. The Intel chips were a bad match, the first 68000 was slow with tiny memories, ... It took a few years and the next generations were better: 68020, the SPARC, better Intel processors, ...<p>But when Lisp Machines were designed at at Xerox/PARC (the Alto running Lisp in 1974, then InterLisp-D), at MIT (the CONS in 1975 and CADR), at BBN (the Jericho in 1979) general purpose hardware WAS unpractical for running Lisp, Lisp applications and their development environments.<p>Later in the mid 80s the architectures were brought to microprocessors (TI Explorer Megachip, Symbolics Ivory). It was also tried to design RISC based chips: SPUR, Xerox, Symbolics, ... but then the market for Lisp went away.",1376330111

However there are things a degree gives you that most people don&#x27;t think about.  Part of this might be because i&#x27;m on the East coast where education is a big part of who you are, but I&#x27;ve experienced a huge social stigma.  There&#x27;s an extra burden on you when you don&#x27;t have a degree.  That stigma will impact you professionally, but also socially.  You&#x27;ll want to hang out with people who you view as your peers.  The thing is that most of those people went the standard route.  I&#x27;ve found the easiest way to cope is to just not bring it up.  When it does come up, I&#x27;ve had good friends change the way they talk to you.  I&#x27;m always straight up with my bosses, but with friends and coworkers it depends.<p>Secondly, more important then what you learn (though what you learn is important) is the network you build.  There&#x27;s a saying, A players hire A players, B players hire C players and so on.  Have you ever wondered who hired the B players?  Usually its B players who got lucky.  A lot of those B players are like us.  You probably want to work with other A players, but they all met in college, and when one goes to a new company the rest of their posse follows.  So that recruiter who&#x27;s getting you a job is probably going to get you into a B role if you&#x27;re good, but you&#x27;re not going to be working with people who are at the top of their game.  If your goal is to be the best you can be, you need to work with the people who are the best.<p>4 years is a big part of your life, but trust me.  I wish i would have made the full investment.

When debugging production systems at that scale you want to minimize the number of moving parts given the problem is so hard to begin with.<p>ABI compatibility just postulates that the bytes entering and leaving the interface will be marshalled the same way.

Android is nice in the sense that it&#x27;s more open and you (I assume, at least, having never owned an iPhone) have more choices to use open-source software.  There are other bits and pieces that I also like, like the the modular nature of the software (you can use a different launcher, etc.).<p>But I disagree with a lot of the pluses in this article.  I find the back button eminently confusing.  I can never reliably predict what will happen when I go back.  Sometimes if I go back from within Firefox, it&#x27;ll go to the last app I used and <i>close</i> Firefox.  Other times it&#x27;ll go to the last page, or to the home screen.  Sometimes in my now-playing screen of PowerAmp back will go to the album list, other times to the home screen.  I can <i>never</i> reliably predict where back will go.<p>The UI theme is also shockingly utilitarian.  I&#x27;ve got one of the nicest screens ever produced, 320 ppi, in my hand, and I&#x27;m using it to render a #000000 background, #ffffff text, and the occasional solid blue line?  Really?  Maybe I just don&#x27;t like the whole &quot;flat UI&quot; paradigm that&#x27;s becoming the new hotness.<p>Things also get more difficult when you try to leave the Google ecosystem.  There&#x27;s no CalDAV or CardDAV sync built in (though it&#x27;s available with flaky and inconsistent addons), and removing all of the Google branding (like the search box at top) doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible.  The Google apps, while functional for the most part, are all very inconsistent in their themeing and UI.<p>Overall I get the impression that Android will, just like Linux, be eternally &quot;almost there&quot;.  The version that fixes all the little niggles will be forever just over the horizon.  Google&#x27;s had six years and its unbelievable muscle to polish it, and it still feels kind of half-baked to me.

Taking Algorithms was good for me too, even if I could already hack on harder stuff than my classmates. So, I major in something other than CS.<p>Keep in mind that you also might decide that you hate working in programming altogether, as I did, so being a generalist might be a good idea. Major in math, philosophy or a foriegn language (or whatever else interests you). You&#x27;ll learn, have a possible back-up and escape with a degree, if you need one.<p>I think college has become diluted to some degree (I rail against it a lot, even moreso now that my old university did away with English 101 for a lot of majors because it&#x27;s &quot;too hard&quot;), but you can always challenge yourself.

Weird - maybe it&#x27;s just me but &quot;Display&quot; is not associated with &quot;Wallpaper&quot; in my head. &quot;Display&quot; means things like screen resolution, which device I want the display beamed to, etc. Android is riddled with &quot;not quite wrong but takes a second to remember&quot; things like this.<p>I told my wife yesterday, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it was possible that someone, in 2013, would develop a phone that was worse at event notifications than the iPhone but they&#x27;ve done it with Android!&quot;<p>For reference, I&#x27;ve only been on Android for about six weeks at this point.

6200276,comment,6199256,6200188,2,0,sologoub,,,"&quot;A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (plural: automata), or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits. It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. The machine is in only on one state at a time; the state it is in at any given time is called the current state. It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is called a transition. A particular FSM is defined by a list of its states, and the triggering condition for each transition.&quot; Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine</a><p>Basically, it&#x27;s a way to track known &quot;state&quot; of a system and know valid and invalid (or prohibited) operations that can be performed and what &quot;next&quot; state these operations move the system to.<p>For example, in a phone call, if the state is &quot;ringing&quot;, your next options can be &quot;answered&quot;, &quot;no answer&quot;, &quot;busy&quot;, or &quot;failed&quot; (including refusal to route, not in-service numbers, etc.). If you try to move the call into some other state, for example, &quot;queued&quot;, a state machine should refuse to do so and respond with an error.<p>A more complex example could be in managing conference rooms or call transfers.",1376326953

The seamless Google integration really is the killer feature.<p>However, from a developer perspective, I&#x27;m still staunchly in the &quot;I want to build on iOS&quot; camp because of the Android fragmentation issue and because there still seems to be an overwhelming majority of consumer spend on the iOS app ecosystem compared to Android. The Google apps on iOS are really very nice (though admittedly not as nice as their Android counterparts), but the only Google app I really want at this point is a Calendar app. Syncing and manipulating Google Calendar events with the native iOS Calendar app is still pretty terrible.",1376326838

I have them on my purchasing page, why not put them on my landing page.<p>I love little ideas like that where I can have the A/B test literally live within a minute.<p>With regards to testimonials: I have rotated through a couple.  They're all authentic so I can't create perfect tests of every element, but my experience has been that a generic testimonial attributed to someone just like the target customer outperforms a better testimonial attributed to someone who isn't.  (In my case, a name suggesting an older woman <i>clocks</i> a generic male name.  Which in unsurprising with 95% of my customers being ladies and most of them being older.)",1276325526

The decision to try it was spurred by more time spent with an iPad. I also tried replacing the mode with Isolator on my work computer, which is looking promising for the more inter-application-focused workflow I need there.<p>It's amazing what a difference either of these approaches makes. Given that this movement is getting coverage in The Economist now, I almost expect Apple to implement something not entirely unlike Isolator for 10.7.",1276324967

1425660,comment,1423092,1423870,0,0,ktsmith,,,"In schools on the watch list in Nevada where the state has stepped in teachers are no longer really allowed to teach. In 4th grade students receive grades in Reading, Writing, Math, Art, Social Studies, Physical Education and a few other categories. At these schools the teachers are only allowed to teach reading, writing and math. Every lesson plan must be geared towards meeting a standard in one of those three categories. The teachers are required to give out grades in the areas they are not allowed to teach. When pressed on ""what"" grade the children should receive the answer is typically ""whatever you feel is appropriate."" These children aren't receiving an education, they are being taught how to memorize information for their CRT's then for their benchmarks, then for whatever test follows that.<p>This isn't what teachers want, this is what teachers are forced to do by their states in order to achieve the largest number of passing schools and keep federal funding levels high.",1276324826
1425659,comment,1425246,1425536,0,0,astrofinch,,,"I disagree.  My intuition is that if Mark was to focus on only one of his startups, it would only become about twice as successful.  I think it makes sense to work on them all simultaneously if they all seem equally promising.<p>Mentions of the ""80/20 principle"" make me wince, because both 80 and 20 are stated with 2 significant figures too many.  But the idea behind it--""there's a lot of variation in the effectiveness of activities you classify as 'work'""--is correct.  If Mark does just the most promising tasks for each startup, he'll be doing pretty damn good.<p>Your comment is a good example of a HN user suggesting a simple heuristic for answering an important question, which I find annoying.  Another example would be Paul Graham's advice to make a product that scratches your own itch.  Your domain expertise should definitely be a factor when choosing between two startup ideas, but I could probably think of three other factors that are at least as important.<p>I guess I could live with the simple heuristics if they were accompanied by detailed justifications explaining why they're better than most conceivable complex heuristics, but they never seem to be.  Simple heuristics are sometimes correct, but there are so many people spouting simple heuristics just because they like simplicity that simple heuristics have a large burden of proof to overcome, in my mind at least.",1276324745

1425655,comment,1423092,1423315,0,0,ktsmith,,,"You don't need cheaters to reach a point where the expectations are so high they are unattainable. If you read the growth measures listed on the government education sites you'll see that states have proposed plans with ridiculous claims such as having ALL students passing their exams by 2014. While there are modified calculations for special education students this is still almost certainly unachievable in reality.<p>A perfect example would be the high school that I attended. This is a school in a small community (40k people when I attended, maybe 60k now) with a significant amount of wealth. The high school specifically has received massive amounts of donations for both academics and sports. Since the inception of NCLB the school has routinely made AYP however in 2008-2009 the school did not. The reason the school didn't is entirely due to students receiving ""Individualized Education Plans"" (IEP). With the mainstreaming of special needs and special education students this means that an entire school is being placed on the needs improvement list due to a small subset of the population receiving special education services.<p>I fully expect that in the next three to five years the vast majority of schools that have routinely made AYP will no longer be able to show adequate growth. When the children of upper middle class families start attending ""failing"" schools you'll start to hear a lot of complaints about NCLB.",1276324360

1425653,comment,1423092,1423906,0,0,ktsmith,,,"The financial incentive to cheat seems to be a new issue and is certainly not even a valid issue at many schools. Nevada doesn't pay teachers bonuses. Teachers at Title I G schools will be eligible for bonuses in 2010-2011 but that is part of the Title I G grant. Of the only school I am aware of in Northern Nevada that is being investigated for cheating, the school is a charter school that also does not offer bonuses. My wifes very close friend taught there during the 2009-2010 school year (not the year causing the investigation) and the issue appears to be due to a breach in protocol during testing. An administrator had students from classes with young and inexperienced teachers that didn't know or weren't trained on the testing protocols called to his office. The claim is that these students tests weren't collected while they were out of the room, they were not escorted to the office, and the administrator coached them or provided them answers. There may be more schools under investigation in southern Nevada (Clark County/Las Vegas most likely). The other schools that I'm aware of being investigated are all charter schools. They are being investigated for misappropriation of funds or other abuses but not cheating.",1276323891

1425645,comment,1423092,1425562,0,0,ktsmith,,,"I'll second this. My wife is also a teacher and every time I hear people talk about how little teachers work I want to scream. I don't know a single teacher that puts in less than 50 hours per week. In many schools teachers don't have any prep time any more and all lesson planning and other activities must be completed on the teachers own time. Summers aren't paid. Money spent in the classroom or on the students isn't tax deductible unlike damn near every other profession and their tools. Our school district doesn't have stipends, instead teachers provide a supply list and the school administrator determines what will be bought based on the available budget. Different schools have different budgets in many cases as some schools will qualify for extra federal funding via Title I for example. We have spent an average of 10% of my wifes yearly income on her classroom in each of the last four years ($3600). We also spend additional funds every year for my wife to attend continuing education or other training programs that she needs to meet her licensing requirements.<p>I'm often asked how we can possibly spend that much money on her class and it's a little bit complicated. While maybe $500 goes towards supplies such as pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, recorders and other basic implements we also spend money directly on the students. My wife typically buys every student a book for Christmas, we supply everything to holiday parties etc. Each year my wife spends another $500 or so on new wall hangings, new books for her library, teaching aids, resource books and more. The majority of the money however is spent taking care of the students in the most need. 100% of the schools students are on the free and reduced lunch program and the school is classified as Title II which means a dinner program is also provided to the neighborhood. Each winter we end up buying a large number of warm jackets, boots, gloves etc. In a neighborhood with 85% of the families living at or below the poverty level you wouldn't believe how much of a difference small amounts of help like that mean to the students and their families. My wife once had a student break down in tears when he received a winter coat. He told her that now his mom didn't have to worry about it and could pay the power bill. At Christmas we buy gifts (clothes) for the students that aren't included in the district wide program for the ""underprivileged"".<p>We certainly don't have to spend any of that money however my wife is there for the children and not for the money.",1276323090

Imagine the likes of the Eee PC with a thin client that basically just has Chrome, plus a locally hosted web server with some basic productivity apps?  You can run the apps standalone or hosted in the cloud.  You could even migrate your local standalone data to the cloud, or sync it so you can work in both modes.<p>You don't have to move the IE userbase on PCs.  It's not even certain that everyone will be using PCs in the future.  (Maybe just content creators, designers, and programmers will be using them?)",1220554293

- you can't generally choose between competing unions
- unions monopolize industries and/or professions<p>In other first world countries you generally have a choice about which union you join and there aren't any jobs which require union membership.<p>Unions can be useful to
- have qualified people on your side in case of a problem with your employer
- influence political decisions to protect and improve employees rights<p>I'm pretty sure the lack of functioning unions is the reason the US is the only 1st world country that doesn't guarantee health care for it's workers, and that wages have stagnated over the last 35 years or so.<p>Of course the system is so entrenched it seems very unlikely anything will change in the foreseeable future.",1220553737

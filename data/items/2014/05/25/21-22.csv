7797741,comment,7793386,7797172,1,0,bane,,,"> Do you really think investing in a diamond mining company would resemble that profile at all?<p>So by this logic, anything that&#x27;s not a high risk, high gain investment vehicle isn&#x27;t worth the time? Better not tell the entire non-VC investment market that.<p>> If you really can&#x27;t see the difference between the investment risk in a mining operation to challenge a 90% marketshare conglomerate, vs an investment risk in a 50 person internet startup, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a point in debating any further.<p>De Beer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t own 90% of the market anymore. They&#x27;re vulnerable on two fronts, manufactured diamonds and diamond mines they don&#x27;t own, both providing product at a lower price than they&#x27;ve traditionally commanded as a market monopoly.<p>More importantly, how exactly do you think new mines and new mining companies  (of virtually any kind) form exactly? According to you, they&#x27;re virtually impossible and we shouldn&#x27;t ever see them. But we see them all the time. Mines are investments just like anything else.<p>But look, if you&#x27;re going to just keep inflating perfectly normal business barriers that affect <i>any</i> kind of business into reasons why somebody shouldn&#x27;t get specifically into the diamond business, then it&#x27;s you who probably shouldn&#x27;t get into the diamond business.<p>Somebody else with investment capital to burn sourcing product and building a market, like every other business in history, shouldn&#x27;t let you get in the way.",1401055130

I learned everything I know from reading, watching videos and having my form critiqued.  It&#x27;s actually better to go to a good powerlifting gym and make friends with some strong people, but you don&#x27;t NEED to.  At least not until you get to pretty elite levels.<p>In fact, going to a the typical trainer at the gym is a waste of money, effort, and is MORE likely to get you hurt (like rhabdomyolysis for instance).  Half of those guys will just have you balance on a bosu ball while doing some arbitrary movement, and rake in your hundred+ dollars an hour.  You might go home more sore than a 30 minute lifting session, but you effectively wasted your time, and probably simply decreased the likelyhood you&#x27;ll even go back.<p>No, lifting weights isn&#x27;t some magical or super technical thing (unless you are doing Olympic lifting, then, then I&#x27;d suggest getting a coach, not a trainer).<p>Edit: FWIW, if you can find a trainer that can DL 500lbs that is at a regular gym, I&#x27;d be liable to eat my hat.  Now show me that same trainer that actually trains his clients with a routine for beginners as good or better than Starting Strength, and I&#x27;ll eat my hat without ketchup.",1401055112

For example it&#x27;s common place to get a car loan, even though you can&#x27;t afford a car. In my opinion this is dangerous to your financial health, much better to buy a lower cost car for example and avoid a loan.

One of the things that I found odd about it was how externally-focused it was - everything seemed to be about various alien species and unknown astronomical phenomenon, with almost nothing about what this Federation that they all serve is and how it really works. All I remember is drips and drabs of that, which is a shame, when there are so many ideas that could stand to be explored.<p>Like what exactly is a replicator, and how does it work? The fine details of that would all have massive effects on what the society as a whole looks like. Can anybody replicate anything on them? Including weapons and drugs? If not, who decides what they can make, and how do they enforce it? They presumably require energy, and where does that come from? Is there a limit to how much stuff a person can make?<p>This also gets into the rather odd and poorly fleshed-out idea of a society without money. Exactly how does this society work without money? Books can and have be written on ideas around this, but it&#x27;s just kind of casually thrown out there, with no exploration of the implications on how the greater society functions.",1401054907

I&#x27;m saying the DoJ produced a graph that would back up their narrative, but didn&#x27;t provide the actual raw data, or an explanation of how the graph was produced. That makes it useless.<p>> It is clear that you won&#x27;t believe any source<p>I won&#x27;t believe obviously-biased &quot;sources&quot; that have no real data.<p>In any case, I think focusing on the current prices of eBooks is not actually very helpful. Amazon has the power to set prices at whatever the heck they want. And the publishers had no recourse, because not selling on Amazon meant not selling, period. But the artificially-low prices Amazon was using for e.g. bestsellers was <i>not sustainable</i> for the publishers. It was not a healthy market, and there was zero reason to believe, had Apple not entered the market, that Amazon would continue selling at those prices indefinitely.<p>Artificially low prices are usually assumed to be good for consumers, and the DOJ certainly made that claim, but that&#x27;s not true. Consumers do not benefit in the long-term from an unsustainable market. They also don&#x27;t benefit from a market with no competition. The latter is what Amazon was trying to create, by keeping prices artificially low on bestsellers. This is predatory pricing, and their goal was to control the entire eBook market. Once they had complete dominance, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that they would have raised prices so they would stop taking a loss on all these $9.99 books (in case you aren&#x27;t aware, Amazon was actually paying the publishers more than $9.99 for the bestsellers they were selling at that price). And in a market without competition it&#x27;s very likely that Amazon would be selling books at prices higher than a healthy competitive market (like the one Apple was creating with their entry). Here&#x27;s an article from a year ago with evidence that Amazon was already starting to raise prices: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/business/as-competition-wanes-amazon-cuts-back-its-discounts.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&gwh=6C43B94F37871245E11C270408988C54&gwt=pay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/business/as-competition-wa...</a>",1401054220

Almost equally unbelievable is a society that isn&#x27;t incredibly emotionally dysfunctional. There is little in the way of psychopathy, narcissism, addiction, unhealthy ideological fanaticism, or depression on display among the protagonists.<p>Cyberpunk has proven to be the most prophetic of the sci-fi genres by far. It&#x27;s done that by being technologically optimistic and socially pessimistic. So far it seems right on-- technology continues to advance, but globally it looks as if the normal arc of society is from freedom to despotism followed by a decay into syndicated criminality. The mafia state -- almost exactly as depicted in the common cyberpunk setting -- looks like the ascendant future. If there are warp-driven starships in the future they will likely be flown by the various factions of the Russian mob, the American criminal overworld, Los Zetas, Chinese Triads, and of course the Yakuza.

It is worth noting that TNG was super soft-sci-fi not &quot;real&quot; sci fi and as such reflects its era&#x27;s social commentary, nothing more, no alternative universe type of effect which is so interesting about hard sci fi.<p>Don&#x27;t have to limit consideration solely to Trek series to see a growing pessimism about the future from a cultural perspective.  A smooth drift across all cultural properties from utopian to dystopian futures.<p>If you do want to have a tech talk about Trek, specifically TNG, its fun to recall tech of that era.  I had an old XT class PC and watched it on a Sony Japanese made 12 inch SD TV, and for the TNG premiere, they simulcasted the audio on a local FM radio station in stereo, which sounded pretty awesome.  Then after an episode I&#x27;d dial into a local BBS and discuss, of course a BBS being a BBS that means a good discussion takes about a week, which is just about right...  About two years into the series I got access to usenet and eventually a SLIP account on the internet (SLIP being kinda like a static configured by hand networking parameters with out-of-band authentication, but otherwise kinda like PPP, of course in this post-modem era maybe PPP is becoming unknown?).",1401051957

In 2009 I fell ~20ft into the sea whilst kitesurfing, badly dislocating the same shoulder. It resulted in a pretty crazy shoulder operation that needed a lot of work to get back range of motion and strength.<p>I started with physiotherapy and once the range of motion was back I slowly moved onto weights (using Starting Strength). It went well, but I can&#x27;t claim to have loved it like I do snowboarding.<p>A friend suggested going to a Krav Maga[1] class he attends. I haven&#x27;t looked back since, and do between 2 and three sessions a week. I dropped the weights and Rip&#x27;s diet advice, and went back to eating like I always do (pretty healthy, good mix of red meat and pasta and potatoes, vegetables).<p>I&#x27;ve put on weight (always been slim), strength is back to what it was, and I&#x27;ve not been this fit since I was conscripted in 1988.<p>Whilst I&#x27;m sure weights would do more for how I look (secondary for me, I&#x27;ve always been good with girls anyway), Krav Maga does more for how I feel. I guess there&#x27;s no silver bullet that works for everybody. You try a few things on, and keep what suits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga</a>, and <a href=""https://www.wittenburg.co.uk/Entry.aspx?id=ce9c6cf4-6b3e-4194-8739-ad9165e37d26"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wittenburg.co.uk/Entry.aspx?id=ce9c6cf4-6b3e-419...</a>",1401051928

7797554,comment,7797134,7797134,1,0,jqm,,,"The fitness regime I got more out of than anything else has been interval training.<p>I worked out with weights for years and occasionally would do some cardio. I think the logic was... cardio doesn&#x27;t make you look good in a swimsuit like lifting weights does, and at the time impressing ladies and intimidating other guys was priority (lets don&#x27;t lie to ourselves about motive here!).<p>Then, I got a little older and impressing ladies became less important and general health and a sense of well being more important. I read an article that made me realize many of the same principals of weight training can be applied to inner muscles as well. A knowledgeable person wouldn&#x27;t go to the gym and lift 5 pound 300 times and expect to get stronger. Instead they would lift 80% of what they could 5 times in sets. This is what builds strength.<p>The same principal applies to interval training for heart and lungs. Rather than getting on a treadmill for 45 minutes at a slow slog you push yourself to a percent of max heart rate for like 3 minutes in sets (the same as weight training). The workouts don&#x27;t take that long and I found they greatly improved my feeling of health and general vigor. There are a number of studies on the benefits of improved heart stroke volume etc. from interval training which I can&#x27;t find at the moment.",1401051758

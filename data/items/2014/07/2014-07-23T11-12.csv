When I refactor, I often think &quot;this is unclear and should be commented,&quot; but I&#x27;ve learned instead to think &quot;this is unclear and should be factored out and given a significant name.&quot; So I ended up with this:<p><pre><code>    shouldPickWorkUnit :: (ImportId, WorkUnit) -> STM Bool\n    shouldPickWorkUnit (k, u) =\n      case hostNameFor url of\n        Nothing       -> return True -- Invalid URLs are fast to process.\n        Just hostName ->\n          takeWorkThat&#x27;sAlreadyDone <*>\n            (don&#x27;tTakeSomeoneElse&#x27;sWork <*>\n              don&#x27;tExceedTheRateLimitFor hostName)\n</code></pre>\nThis way, the domain logic is legible from the actual code, which strikes me as almost always better than having tricky code with comments.

The stage is passive from the retroburn (just after the stage separation) for the several hundreds seconds it is flying back, and large part of that trajectory is in atmosphere, and stage has a high sail factor: it is big and, being almost empty, lightweight. So it might be dragged by wind too far from the landing site to compensate in hover mode which is i assume only 100-200 meters or so, even if original entry trajectory is perfect. Ballistic missile warheads for example, accumulate about 100 meters or error due to this factor despite they are much smaller/have higher density and fly several times as fast. A an additional short mid-flight engine burn to compensate may be a solution but so far i haven&#x27;t heard of that. Anyone has an idea?",1406115702

The vertex shading works at the level of triangle vertices, effectively translating and and transforming the vertices, and then the fragment shader colors in each individual pixel.<p>So for a standard scene, the CPU tells the GPU: &#x27;Right, we&#x27;ve got a room, with some pillars, and a monster, and a few lights, positioned like this&#x27;, and then the CPU calculates what that looks like.<p>What Inigo is doing is that the CPU only knows there are two triangles - a quad covering the scene - so it just tells the GPU to draw a flat rectangle. The vertex shader does nothing but maintain the flat rectangle. However, because the fragment shader can be arbitrary logic, rather than just painting it with a solid color or even a texture, it is running its own simulation that involves drawing an entire scene.<p>----<p>[1] More these days with Geometry shaders, but that&#x27;s another topic<p>[2] Sometimes called a pixel shader, although really that&#x27;s incorrect - Fragment is a more accurate term",1406113269

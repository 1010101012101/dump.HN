8850745,comment,8849702,8850189,0,0,the_af,,,"I&#x27;d say the opposite is actually true. Often generic code is clearer and less error prone that non-generic code. This is because generic code reduces the number of assumptions you make (e.g. if you can&#x27;t know the actual type of the elements of a container, there are fewer operations you can apply to them. A function that concatenates two lists cannot accidentally try adding 1 to each element, because it doesn&#x27;t know whether the elements are numbers. Hence, a whole class of mistakes is eliminated before you get the chance to commit them).<p>For example, (barring side-effects for simplicity) there is one and only one possible implementation for a function with signature:<p><pre><code>    f: T -> T
</code></pre>
Where T is a generic type. Contrast this with:<p><pre><code>    g: Int -> Int
</code></pre>
which has many implementations, many of them possibly not what you intended. If what you intended was the identity function for integers, better use <i>f</i>, because it has fewer possible implementations than <i>g</i>. It&#x27;s even easier for the reader to understand: since <i>f</i> doesn&#x27;t mention integers, there&#x27;s no point in checking whether it does any operation with them. Of course this is a trivial example, but the same point applies to more complex functions.",1420642424

In DevOps you add a few tools, learn about real big data, configuration management, and maybe adopt a few more powerful languages to take you beyond good ol&#x27; shell.  It&#x27;s not the tools that separate DevOps from Systems Admin work, it&#x27;s the philosophy and approach.<p>Those original SysAdmin foundations are at the core of any DevOps engineer.  The tools are not radically different, it&#x27;s the crucial paradigm difference that actually matters.<p>I&#x27;d agree with the basic premise of the author, but I&#x27;d add that it&#x27;s as much about keeping up with evolved methodologies that&#x27;s as important.<p>[1] Grandiose title deliberately icky!",1420641155

That being said, I&#x27;ve had better luck with using things like Coq to write a certified interpreter and then outputing to OCaml.<p>In any case, when we write a simple interpreter for a typed language, we normally run things through a type checker first and then evaluate it.  After type checking, we know that certain errors can not occur, such as adding an integer to a boolean, but this information gets lost when passing everything to the evaluator.  As far as the evaluator knows, all we have are expressions, so we still have to check for situations like adding an integer to a boolean in the evaluator.  Again, this can <i>not</i> occur because we type checked everything, but these branches are necessary to have the OCaml compiler type check everything.  What GADTs allow is for the type checker to translate an expression into a <i>typed</i> expression and then the evaluator translates a typed expression into a value.  This eliminates these redundant branches.<p>For some sample code, I wrote about this on StackOverflow some time back.  The following link contains both a traditional implementation of an OCaml interpreter as well as one that uses GADTs.  It differs some from the one in the article because I work out how to make this work with an environment, lambda functions, and closures:<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22676975/simple-lambda-calculus-dsl-using-gadts-in-ocaml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22676975/simple-lambda-c...</a>",1420640566

As a personal anecdote, I <i>hated</i> the way math was taught in elementary and high school, as a dry series of formulas to be memorized (particularly geometry, which I took in the 7th grade).  Math <i>should</i> be fun, but for many students, it shouldn&#x27;t be a series of abstract problems unconnected to the real world.<p>My main complaint here is about learning in the abstract vs learning in specifics.  That&#x27;s my <i>sole</i> argument against Lockhart&#x27;s piece.  I regret ever using the word &quot;playfulness&quot;, because that has nothing to do with my main argument (and if you re-read my top comment, I think  you&#x27;ll understand this).  My concern is about abstract-to-specific versus specific-to-abstract learning.<p>But let&#x27;s quote a little more from the preface of &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot;:<p>&quot;Abstract mathematics is a wonderful subject, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it: It&#x27;s beautiful, general, and useful.  But its adherents had become deluded that the rest of mathematics was inferior and no longer worth of attention.  The goal of generalization had become so fashionable that a generation of mathematicians had become unable to relish beauty in the particular, to enjoy the challenge of solving quantitative problems, or to appreciate the value of technique.  Abstract mathematics was becoming inbred and losing touch with reality; mathematical education needed a concrete counterweight in order to restore a healthy balance&quot;.<p>So, that basically sums of my feelings about how I was taught math in college.  I&#x27;m not going to pretend to know what Knuth or Lockhart believe, but that paragraph describes my personal concerns about math education.<p>I&#x27;m not a professional mathematician, nor even a math major, but I am an educated parent and informed citizen, and so fall directly into Lockhart&#x27;s intended audience for this piece.  I&#x27;ve now read it <i>5</i> times, and each time I get more and more the feeling that he wants mathematics to be taught deductively, as an abstraction.  I base this interpretation on how much &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;abstract&quot; learning is emphasized in the essay, and how much disdain he has for practical math applications.  I&#x27;m not going to pull out all the quotes, but if you disagree, then I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>Unfortunately, I honestly can&#x27;t afford to spend any more time on this argument, so I&#x27;ll have to read your rebuttal (if any) and stop there.",1420639525

I would not call myself a One Trick Pony, but I am specialized enough in legacy systems that I face the same danger.<p>However, I can play this to my advantage -- as more and more of my colleagues have moved on to greener pastures, I have specialized in modernizing these old system to Web-based UIs, as well as doing consulting projects to migrate the applications to new platforms or simply shut down the old systems. As time goes on, the rates for these projects are increasing. I am also old enough to have a nest egg built up, while leading a simple life with a smaller monthly &quot;burn rate&quot; in my personal life than most other people I know.<p>For me, I can ride this tech until it dies. It will be the end of my tech career. But then comes a semi-retirement where I can get by with the residual income I get from a couple of my side projects and my little hobby farm.<p>So the real lesson is that being a one trick pony can be a terrible thing... or you can be aware of your situation, and be prepared for it. If I had no nest egg, no residual income, and no plan to change my lifestyle when the meteor hits, I&#x27;d be in trouble. Instead, I&#x27;m actually kind of looking forward to it.",1420639450

Looks like a typical false-positive generated by a heuristic.<p>There is no malware in the SourceForge Downloader, you can safely use it to install FileZilla. While the SourceForge Installer may present third-party offers, they are
clearly labeled as such. All third-party offers can easily be declined. Nothing unwanted is being installed without your consent. Declining offers does not prevent nor otherwise disturb the installation of FileZilla.<p>If you do not wish to use the SourceForge installer, have a look at the additional download options listed on the FileZilla website.&quot;<p>His stance seems to be that it&#x27;s not malware, rather a false positive (I have no proof to claim he&#x27;s wrong and if he is, it could be a honest mistake; he&#x27;s trusting SF, which I understand), and he mentions that you can also download Filezilla from their own website, without the SF installer.<p>That seems pretty reasonable to me, but again: at first I got the impression they (FileZilla&#x27;s owners) simply didn&#x27;t care.<p>I hate what SF has been doing, and I refuse to use their installers (although I&#x27;m primarily a Linux-user so I don&#x27;t have to worry about these installers, thankfully), but I don&#x27;t really feel like the FileZilla owners should be avoided as it looks like they&#x27;re simply trusting SourceForge, nothing more.

When working with other developers, this often, as well, involves some initial disagreement about the best solution that accomplishes without adding unneeded complexity. And sometimes even I start getting impatient with the slowness of the deliberate process and consensus building -- it&#x27;s easier to do by myself (which takes even more time).<p>These are rare circumstances that allow for such slow coding though, in the pressure to get things out quick and get them used and then quickly iterate.  We have a (hard-won, reaction to other harmful development ideologies) overall ethos in our industry(ies) of getting things out quickly without needing to get them perfect or fully understand where it will lead you, and then iterate based on feedback. That works pretty well for UI, although it can still contain the same pitfalls. It is even harder for infrastructural architecture though, it&#x27;s probably still possible as long as you are careful and deliberate with your iterations (although knowing when to break backwards compat is still a trick), but, anyway, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s easy.",1420639211

6855420,comment,6855106,6855106,21,0,LukeWalsh,,,"I understand concerns about focusing on issues that are directly pertinent to the people of a country, however historically we have never seen a culture solve all of its pressing problems and then decide to focus on science and exploration. Instead what we see is cultures committing to solve problems at home, but also investing resources in programs that look forward to new discoveries. I think it&#x27;s short sighted to postpone space exploration simply because we don&#x27;t have time for it today, or because we don&#x27;t see the tangible benefit. The point of space exploration from the beginning has been to search for &quot;truth and understanding,&quot; [1] a goal so noble that our astronauts risk their lives in pursuit of it.

Understand that what negative impacts may have from your frame of reference, and figure out if they are acceptable for you before hand.<p>Case in point, say you can develop a system that will 100% secure the communication and organization of resistance groups in countries with oppressive government. There is no guarantee that the end result of that is something you want. Maybe it&#x27;ll lead to genocide of the once ruling tribe once the government is overthrown.

It is equally naive to suggest that the government is justified in the slaughter of everyone who might ever do us harm.<p>Has it been abused, certainly.  Show me a law that hasn&#x27;t.  The difference between pardon and NDAA-type of laws is that the latter has no redeeming characteristic.  Its sole purpose is to vest a single person with the power to do literally whatever he wishes, without oversight, without scrutiny, without potential for remediation.  There is no justice to be found in its exertion, <i>even when used for noble intent</i>.<p>There are, or at least were, procedures in place that would have prevented such atrocity from occurring, but those procedures were nullified by the NDAA.  There is no need for government oversight whatsoever, nor any reason to suggest that whomever happens to be president cannot simply murder whomever he wants under the guise of national interest.<p>I understand that the NDAA and PATRIOT Act weren&#x27;t created in a bubble, but as you have implored me to &quot;study the history&quot; (which I am well aware of, and don&#x27;t understand what I might have said to convince you of my ignorance of an era that I was actively involved in), I would implore you to study the documents that led up to our nation&#x27;s independence.<p>Overwhelmingly, they point to the foulness of this sort of unchecked power, and the founding fathers literally made every effort to ensure that this sort of abuse never came to pass.<p>Whether or not the NDAA or PATRIOT Act is ever used is irrelevant, their very existence negates the tenets of our central foundation of governance.<p>> Sometimes the US government goes too far, but not nearly as often, or nearly as extreme as you keep saying<p>The federal government goes beyond its Constitutional authority literally every single day in this nation.  The government exerts federal control in California to arrest the proprietors of legal marijuana dispensaries.  They do this by abusing the Interstate Commerce Clause.  The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power &quot;To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes&quot; -- and by abusing the &#x27;among&#x27;, have defined that to mean that they can control any action within a state, whether or not that action may extend beyond a state&#x27;s borders.<p>The federal government further abuses the &#x27;Necessary and Proper&#x27; clause to extend its powers beyond their section 8 enumerated powers.<p>There are literally countless examples of federal overreach, some of which are gaining ground in recent times, like the overturning of DOMA (Thanks Obama).  I&#x27;m sorry you don&#x27;t see them, or don&#x27;t see them as the overreach I so strongly believe them to be.<p>Either way, I won&#x27;t further engage in a conversation predicated on your baseless attacks due to a relatively minor disagreement on merits.  I would encourage you to learn how to converse with others without resorting to ad hominem attacks.  Your views aren&#x27;t invalid just because I disagree with them, however strongly I might, and you&#x27;d do well to acknowledge as much.",1386261981

Random-walk each dollar a few iterations and you end up with a bell curve of money distribution. Now start again and instead of random-walking them, apply a probabilistic walk, where having more dollars makes you a proportionately more likely recipient. You end up with a skewed distribution with a few rich controlling most of the resources. Now imagine being a congress-critter in that skewed world. Who are you going to have to cut deals with? And you can make the rich-get-richer rule steeper now, because the dollar-owners are cutting deals to make dollar-taking easier. And now your wealth distribution looks like the real world.<p>The answer is simply that money itself, the alienable control of resources, is the cause. In a society organized by money, corruption and misrule will result.

Our tasks are to be selfless and to the betterment of all mankind but like any difficult subject there&#x27;s a fog of gray areas and open interpretation to be had. Heck we wear the Iron Ring as a reminder of this sworn duty.<p>However, the role we claim to take on, true &quot;selflessness&quot; is near impossible to reach in practice. Before we are engineers we are people and have basic needs. Without whipping out my Googlefu I would wager there are certainly more cases of people blowing the whistle and seeing their way of life crumble around them than there are who get protected by law. There is massive resistance to change from those who call the shots and if you&#x27;re to go against the grain you&#x27;re looking to sacrifice your career, life, health, etc.. The engineer says &quot;you need to say something or people will die&quot; but the person says &quot;your family needs to eat&quot;.<p>In the end I think engineers weigh decisions of ethics in the moment. A protocol, security appliance or other technology development isn&#x27;t bad, its how its governed to say when its harmful and to or how it gets implemented into the bigger picture that starts to cross ethical boundaries. Any engineer sees the good in his/her work and is perhaps aware of its dark side but elects to overlook it for the good it will provide.<p>Asking engineers to hold themselves to this standard is good. A self-governed society with regulation helps everyone for the better but I feel anyone tasked with decisions that effect the public at large should be held to this accountability. I think I&#x27;m preaching to the choir at this point though.",1386260203

I know of several people on whom counter-obesity problems have had a significantly detrimental effect.<p>I&#x27;ve seen ineffective gastric bypass surgery which led to a friend gaining even more weight and watched helplessly as he slipped into a very depressed and negative state.  As the article points out, if someone said there&#x27;s a drug that just cures cancer it would be laughable.  It is indeed so with weight loss.  Phentermine will have minor side effects with impulse control, addiction, paranoia etc.<p>Interestingly enough, obesity is typically not associated with the &quot;poor&quot; in the rest of the world.  I have often heard it mentioned as an anecdote to how &quot;wealthy&quot; Americans really are.  But therein lies a very interesting problem to which I simply haven&#x27;t seen a very good answer.  Unfortunately the sigtma associated with obesity and the well entrenched and highly profitable &quot;weight-loss&quot; industry gets in the way of significant advances being made in this arena.  Again, as is mentioned in the article, there is even a stigma associated with &quot;diet doctors&quot;, which surely has dissuaded more than a few brilliant minds to explore the field more.<p>Ofcourse, as a programmer who is very familiar with a sedentary lifestyle and the pizza culture, obesity is a serious issues that does affect more than just the poor.  And for crying out loud, I hope someone figures out more about it than pseudo science of obesity we have now.  It&#x27;s not as simple as it looks at first glance.",1386259432

I thought maybe &quot;survival instinct&quot; would help me gain at least fat, where it supposedly activates when you are eating very little, and that is supposed to be the reason why not eating does not help fat people lose weight, but my weight even then just stays the same.

Right now MANY small businesses and startups are failing.  Its important to understand the potential negative consequences of starting a business.  Most people, and especially around here, are in denial about this basic fact: by the numbers, your startup or small business will most likely fail.  Thats ok.  Your job is to do everything you can to beat those odds.<p>Also, most people don't have the luxury of 'capital light.'  When small businesses fail, families usually suffer.  That is part of the game, and its worth talking about once in a while, in between articles about guys that hit it big.",1247128850

Safari 1.3 users would have been able to use the site without Glow, but their experience of it would have been a bit degraded. No doubt less so if a fraction of the time put into developing Glow had been put into finding the best ways to mitigate the page degradation. Safari 1.3 may have had its problems but it is essentially a capable rendering engine for the kind of page functionality the BBC uses. After all the BBC is hardly pushing the envelope for HTML & Javascript technology, nor does it need to in order to deliver its content.<p>I don't see that there is any serious business case for this amount of development to support this level of refinement for such a small group of users. The fact is that developers are in a luxurious position of following what appeals to their vanities rather than delivering value for  public funds.<p>Someone mentioned the team was small. How many of them are contractors vs permanent? I bet they are not all permies. Even so, one permanent salary for two years is a heck of a lot of money to throw after a project replacing something which is 'good enough' and available for free.<p>Can you point to pages or features on the BBC site which, without the use of Glow, would render content inaccessible or completely unusable to Safari 1.3 users if jQuery had been used?",1247128753

Oftentimes, you'll see a little bug somewhere, think ""Oh, we should fix that eventually"", but the conditions that would make it into a really big bug are rare or unknown.  It's only when those conditions actually happen that you think, ""Well shit.  I guess we should've fixed that last week.""<p>If a bug isn't believed to be critical, then waiting to deploy the fix absolutely is the right decision.

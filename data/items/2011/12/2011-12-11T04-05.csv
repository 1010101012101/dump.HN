3339288,comment,3339098,3339098,2,0,gruseom,,,"He puts his finger on the right question: why do large firms exist? But I disagree with the answer. I think a better answer is: they don't. That is, they existed in the past for reasons of industrial scale; but they exist now (at least in post-industrial fields) only by inertia. The wheels of history grind slowly and the monoliths haven't been ground to bits yet. But they will be: into smaller, more productive, hopefully more humanly satisfying bits. It just takes a long time for people to get over the things that everybody ""knows"" about reality, such as that great companies inevitably grow into behemoths.<p>Google is an interesting case, because they manifested so many seminal changes, for example their hacker-centric culture. And they still do some amazing work - yet astonishingly little compared to what one would expect from an organization with tens of thousands of such smart people.<p>This is explained if you consider that we are early in the post-industrial age. It takes time for new organizational forms to develop. This is also an opportunity, because anyone who can see a little further ahead has a chance to leapfrog over their cohort the way Google did. Somebody is going to figure out how to grow a company without dissipating the bulk of its human energy in meetings, politics, and other depressing shit.",1323578903

3339276,comment,3339193,3339193,37,0,jerf,,,"It is hard to see through the veils of history, but one of the things that always strikes me is that if you sit down and really try to put all the pieces together, what you find is an alien world, far more alien than most supposedly alien worlds of science fiction, especially if we're talking about going back all the way to Ancient Greece. What we think of in our bones as civilization doesn't exist then. The closest thing that might get you there is farming communities in the Midwest... with no power, or cell phones, or cars, or houses, with dangerous wild animals still roaming about, no medical treatment, no firearms, and no prior 21st-century civilization thought patterns, and you're still only sort of glimpsing it. Friendship wasn't an affectation, it was a <i>necessity</i>; humans are effectively incapable of surviving as an individual with no social support, and these people were, by modern standards, in a constant state of just barely scraping by. Even wealthy people were still just one bad fall or cut from a lingering death. When reading about the ancient past one must always be sure to keep this backdrop in mind, and not surreptitiously sneak in a modern setting for the drama in your head.<p>As some people say, we're already in a Singularity relative to ancient Grecians, inasmuch as they couldn't understand our world at all... and I think it's true in the opposite direction, too. History doesn't make any sense at all unless you learn to stop seeing it through 20th/21st century preconceptions about ethics or civilization. (And I'm not saying I've got a grasp on the older preconceptions, I've just observed that using my ""default set"" certainly doesn't have much explanatory power for why people do what they do in the past.)<p>I'd submit for your consideration the idea that what we see in ancient friendships is more like what we'd today call the ""war buddy"" bond, because life was a lot more like a war back then. As we move through history and more and more people are no longer engaged in war with Nature just to survive, we see that level of bond fade because we see the conditions that give rise to that level of bond fade. Personally, I would say this is cause for celebration more than sadness.",1323578086

Further confirmations of the Standard Model are in a sense bad news; we <i>want</i> it to come apart so we can examine the pieces. It is true that if we can produce the Higgs we can then study it, but if it then turns out to precisely fit the parameters predicted by the SM, that's bad.<p>This argument should also be read along with the fact that last I knew, none of the accelerators have been able to turn up anything else particularly interesting either. Some of the supersymmetry theories predicted particles in ranges that we should be able to see (barely) and none of them have appeared. We're down to hoping that there's something else to find in the extra room the LHC will give us at full blast or we really will be up a creek.<p>""These days there seem to be many more models out there than there is good science behind it - at least to a layperson like me.""<p>And in fact your observation is connected; particle physics has been starved for data and in the interim have come up with all kinds of things, trying to find things that may have testable consequences.

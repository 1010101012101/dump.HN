7771260,comment,7768371,7771087,9,0,alexqgb,,,"Describing someone as being &quot;off the reservation&quot; means they need to turn around and go back where they belongs a.s.a.p. The expression is pejorative because it rests on the idea is that Native Americans are actually okay when they&#x27;re on reservations, and likewise, that they&#x27;re out of place anywhere else. In reality, reservations are more like prison camps without walls into which these people been unceremoniously dumped.<p>If you want a brief, brutal look at what &quot;the reservation&quot; really means, see this short film from Aeon called &quot;Honor the Treaties&quot;. You&#x27;ll see exactly why the casual acceptance of reservations as places where anyone &quot;truly&quot; belongs is so problematic.<p><a href=""http://aeon.co/film/the-real-legacy-of-manifest-destiny/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeon.co/film/the-real-legacy-of-manifest-destiny/</a><p>Getting back to the expression, it should be avoided for the same reason that you&#x27;d avoid analogies to slave plantations or concentration camps that imply these institutions were benign, defensible things. It&#x27;s far better to use the phrase &quot;way out of line&quot;, which conveys the same meaning, but without the unthinking disregard for genocide, theft of land, and institutionalized deceit that underpin most reservations. For the people who live on reservations, or are connected to those who do, the term is loaded with a lot of bitterness, futility, alienation, and despair. Not to put too fine a point on it, but suicide rates among young people who grow up on reservations are double what they are anywhere else in America.<p>As an aside, the Navajo reservation is an interesting exception to this rule in that it encompasses the territory on which the Navajo have lived for more than 10,000 years, and not some crappy godforsaken piece of land to which they were forcibly relocated. So there&#x27;s a bit more pride in that case. But a history of dismissal and segregation means there&#x27;s still an unbelievable amount of poverty.

Even an encyclopedia isn&#x27;t shy about when it&#x27;s written.<p>If you want your content to appear valuable vs less valuable, write the hell out of your content. Make it impossible to discount the content by making it stand out.<p>In science, researchers don&#x27;t cherry pick and refer studies written in the last 5 years. They go back as far is relevant. They will refer back to hallmark papers regardless how old. Same with nonfiction books. Same with well written blog posts, because good blog authors often cite references to give the proper context.

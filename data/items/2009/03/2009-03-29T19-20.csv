In the recommendations world that's called ""business rules"" and includes things from skewing results based on margins to not showing inappropriate recommendations (say, women's clothing to men).<p>However, I'm pretty sure that Amazon's recommendations don't do that, or don't do it much, anyway.  Their ""similar product"" recommendations seem to be on a very simple (and often mediocre quality) pure counting correlation between two items purchases.  It's much harder to guess which algorithms are at work for personalized recommendations.<p>At the end of the day, profit margins aside, there's a lot that goes into optimizing recommendations that can't be easily measured.  How do you measure customer loyalty based on good recommendations?  There have been a number of market research studies that indicate that recommendations do drive customer loyalty, but it's hard to say where the sweet spot is between skewing things toward higher margins vs. skewing things towards customer utility.  About 80% of Amazon's visitors aren't there to buy stuff -- and that's great for them!  They've become an information portal / window shopping location that happens to also sell stuff.

I think there's a much stronger counter-argument in articulating the other competitive advantages that google works on. Market-share just gives you a buffer.<p>It would take some time for billions to switch, yes; but if there was a search engine that was far superior for what users need, the difficulty of switching would not prevent them. It's the standard pattern of technology adoption.<p>People get attached to consumer goods (e.g. brands of washing powder, chewing gum), but while they also get attached to technology, it doesn't seem to do the technology much good once it has been superseded (DEC anyone?)<p>The lack of a ""far superior search engine"" is the significant barrier, IMHO. And whether such a technology is possible is something I don't claim to know. That's the unpredictable nature of technology/science, and why people like Warren Buffett won't invest in it.",1238353407

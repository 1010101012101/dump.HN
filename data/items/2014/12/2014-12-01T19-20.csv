8683346,comment,8683003,8683003,0,0,Someone1234,,,"> Consider throttling invalid login attempts by IP address or subnet.<p>Oh hell no.<p>First off that is completely ineffective. Botnets are common and inexpensive. But worse still a lot of users often share a single IP (e.g. university dorms, businesses, public wifi, etc).<p>I agree with the first part of this article (i.e. that it is trivial to &quot;prove&quot; a username is valid, and that worse error responses aren&#x27;t accomplishing anything). But that advice is poor.<p>> Check submitted passwords against a dictionary of common passwords (123456, monkey, etc) and ban that traffic extra hard.<p>That seems like a lot of engineering work. Plus the workload of loading up a dictionary and doing a lookup upon each login is resources that frankly could be better used on a slower hashing algorithm (to slow logins and make stored hashes stronger).<p>> Exponential backoff (forcing attackers to try again after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.. seconds) is useful as well.<p>Just open a spreadsheet and determine how long it would take to test 1500 passwords. 1500 is a &quot;short&quot; dictionary of common passwords. Even a 1 minute delay after each 2 attempts (or 2 minutes after 4, or 4 minutes after 8, etc) means 12.5 hours of attempts.<p>I like to set the attempts really high with an equally high lockout. So no normal user will see it. Most users do a password reset after the fourth or fifth attempt, so if you set it on 8 attempts with a 4-6 minute lockout then the majority of users will never run into it.<p>Instead of focusing on these kind of hacks why not just:<p>- Set no maximum password length (250+ characters)<p>- Set the minimum to at least 6 or 7<p>- Get a password score widget (e.g. &quot;weak&quot; &quot;normal&quot; &quot;secure&quot;), traffic light, to encourage better behaviour<p>- When a password is set check it isn&#x27;t in a common password dictionary (a lot of score widgets integrate this!)<p>- You can use Javascript to check a password dictionary as it isn&#x27;t a site-security feature, and anyone who goes out of their way to bypass it only has themselves to blame.<p>- Agreed on 2F, Google Authenticator is trivial to integrate. The only remotely &quot;hard&quot; bit is generating the QR code and a lot of libraries exist for that express purpose.<p>- No clue how you&#x27;d integrate LastPass...<p>- Account Alerts are extremely useful. As are admin alerts. Too many sites get no warning when a lockout occurs, it is pathetic.",1417463969

We focus on producing high quality apps for three separate users: Contractors, Suppliers, and Getable itself.<p>We develop our applications using a modular approach on both the frontend and backend, using a modern, mostly open source JavaScript based stack: CouchDB, Node, Engine.io, Backbone, and responsive design.<p>Our frontend is based heavily on Atomic Design and Development, using an open source library we built called Atomify. We optimize for developer happiness and eliminate as many barriers to getting things on production as we can: we don&#x27;t have any build steps, we have a live reloading component development workflow, and we have tests that run as you write your code.<p>Most of our apps are very frontend heavy, but our backend is all realtime. We share model code between the server and the client to make interacting with our data easy.<p>At the end of the day though, none of that is what makes us get out of bed in the morning. It all comes down to creating great feeling interactions to help our users get their jobs done.<p>Day to Day:<p>- Participate in the team&#x27;s direction and come up with new ideas
- Build modules for both the frontend and backend. We embrace open source and modularized development
- Participate in and contribute to product discussions<p>Requirements:<p>- Have a passion for building easy to use apps for underserved users
- Love to write small, well tested components that can be reused in many contexts
- Have experience working on large JS codebases with a team of other highly skilled engineers
- Be able to work on both the frontend and the backend - it&#x27;s all JS<p>We provide:<p>- Meaningful equity
- Better than average health plans
- Backed by industry leading VCs
- Opportunities to grow as a leader or individual contributor

This is by far the most important point.  You can&#x27;t please all the people all the time, but really push yourself hard not to be toxic to the people around you.  Physical intimidation and violence is extremely toxic behavior, which is the root of our discussion.  Don&#x27;t do it.<p>2) When faced with toxic people, get rid of them in the most permanent and expeditious manner possible.  Rarely will open confrontation be your strategy of choice here.  You escalate things and you find yourself with a beef taking up space in your brain and theirs, and, most importantly, jack shit to show for it.  You get nothing but damage.

As a result, Bell Labs had to license <i>all</i> technologies (except for telephone-related services) freely.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until 1984 when AT&T sold off Bell Labs - almost three decades later.

Asking the children of these startup founders would offer a different perspective, surely. There&#x27;s hundreds and thousands of stories of famous people that behaved completely different at home than their public and professional images would suggest. In fact, sociopaths typically doing well in business very much helps explain the motivating factors for why people can be regarded so well professionally but hated by their families. But even at home we are probably different than how we are professionally anyway regardless of personality and I&#x27;m even different from employer to employer and for the purpose of the thread, that&#x27;s really all that matters, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Just talking to people at a party or a business dinner is not enough to get any semblance of character judgment aside from some pretty stylistic ones (small cues that say more about preferences than worldview, for example). Even playing golf together can hide monstrous raging alcoholics and serial killers from us all because these people have developed almost split personalities after decades of manipulating people. It&#x27;s not necessarily conscious either but almost a personality trait like being really energetic, quiet, paying attention to detail obsessively, etc. I say all this as the son of someone that&#x27;s got the cult leader personality type and how he works has framed how I absolutely refuse to work.

Furthermore, the kind off folks that are attracted to in dysfunctional orgs are similar to men that prey upon insecure women. There&#x27;s similar equivalents for business folks too.<p>So, in short I think pg has been blessed to still have this optimistic view of any flavor of meritocracy.

8683122,comment,8680496,8680496,0,0,Animats,,,"<i>Mr. Turing was a British math prodigy who during World War II broke a supposedly unbreakable Nazi code. He made a programmable machine, which took the information from one task to execute the next, reaching powerful conclusions.</i><p>So much wrong there. Polish cryptographers broke Enigma, and built the first &quot;bombe&quot;, a key-testing machine.  Turing figured out how to speed up the process, at a cost in wiring complexity. Turing never &quot;built a programmable machine&quot;, although he conceptualized one. Flowers designed Colossus, which wasn&#x27;t a general purpose computer, just an electronic key-tester, like a Bitcoin mining ASIC. At Bletchly Park, Turing was part of a team headed by Dilly Knox, working with John Jeffreys and Peter Twinn.<p>There&#x27;s a forgotten history of electronic digital non-general-purpose computing devices: Teleregister (stock quotes), International Totalizator (racetracks), and Reservisor (airline reservations). The WWII cryptanalysis machines, and the ENIAC, all belong to that category. Programming of those involved big plugboards, not loading memory with a program.  That sort of thing disappeared in the 1970s, as CPUs became cheaper. (It&#x27;s back, with FPGAs and ASICs used for high-performance special purpose tasks like packet routing.)<p>The real inventor of the modern computer was John von Neumann, who&#x27;s never had a movie about him.  He&#x27;s the one who insisted that random access memory, with both code and data in the same memory, was the way to go, and that computers should work in binary.  His 1946 paper (<a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall12/cos375/Burks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall12/cos375/Bu...</a>) describes most of basic computer architecture, and will look very familiar to anyone who knows how a simple CPU works. In his spare time, he did some design work on the implosion system for the first atomic bomb, and, using an early computer he designed, the EDSAC, some of the design work for the H-bomb. Also lots of good papers on math and quantum mechanics. Von Neumann was a party guy, known for his dinner parties at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Married twice, divorced once.   Not much angst in his life; he was a cheerful sort and had a good life. Died young, in 1957 at age 53, so he didn&#x27;t get to see the computer era really take off.<p>Even less well known is the inventor of modern cryptanalysis, William F. Friedman. Friedman turned cryptanalysis from a guessing game to a number-crunching problem.  He headed the effort that broke the Japanese &quot;Purple&quot; code, a tougher job than Enigma.  Much of the theory behind cryptanalysis is his work. The auditorium at NSA headquarters is named after him. He was a military officer in WWI, married once. Famous quote: &quot;No new cypher is worth looking at unless it comes from someone who has broken a very hard one.&quot; Friedman really did break some major cyphers on his own.<p>Neither von Neumann nor Friedman had unusual personal lives, so they don&#x27;t have movies.  Both were probably smarter than Turing.",1417462283

I do agree that enabling SPDY by default for the HTTPS case is unfair, but do not let it eclipse the takeaway: most users with most browsers will observe HTTPS being a bit faster (edit: I should rather say &quot;comparable in speed&quot;) in this specific benchmark. How well this result translates to other sites is a different question. For example the benchmark does not measure TLS handshake latency:<p><pre><code>  <!-- &quot;pre-load&quot; HTTPS connection to remove TLS handshake latency when switching to HTTPS test. And set the detectio var -->
  <script src=&quot;https://www.httpvshttps.com/detect-spdy.js&quot;></script>
</code></pre>
For some sites, handshake latency matters very little, so it makes sense to write the benchmark the way they did it. Anyway, the company who made the benchmark probably did it to prove a point: that an image-rich web page can load just as fast on HTTPS as on HTTP.<p>Also, contrary to what a commenter said below, the site <i>does</i> carefully avoid caching interferences by downloading images with a random query string such as <a href=""https://www.httpvshttps.com/check.jpg?123.179881"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.httpvshttps.com/check.jpg?123.179881</a><p>[1] eg. in Chrome pass --use-spdy=off",1417462156

I also strongly suspect I have an underlying genetic disorder that made me more susceptible to this problem, which I&#x27;m going to finally be evaluated for next week.<p>Edit: I should also add the other thing that stood out to me in your post is that I was also told that my problems were psychological and just caused by &quot;anxiety&quot; - it&#x27;s a common misdiagnosis with these kinds of issues by doctors who aren&#x27;t familiar enough with them and the effects. In my case it turned out later that my panic attacks were a result of my body not being able to moderate my heart rate properly. Pretty much everyone I know with autonomic issues went through the &quot;it&#x27;s all in your head&quot; phase of diagnosis before getting real answers.<p>In my case it&#x27;s had a huge effect on me as a professional and programmer, leading me to lose and jump jobs as I attempted to find somewhere that was willing and able to work with my needs, until earlier this year when I finally quit my last job and started freelancing. It&#x27;s still a challenge for me but a huge step towards finding the kind of work I&#x27;m still able to do.<p>Good luck, and good for you in still fighting to be a positive force in the world and for your family.",1417461977

When I quickly move the mouse in a circle on my computer I see the pointer displayed at several, quite far away, locations at the same time. It looks like the same time anyway because of temporal fusion.<p>If the mouse were moving continuously you would be able to see the full trace of its path and not just a few discrete locations along the way. A higher frequency would get closer to this.<p>Also, in an interactive scenario, the frame rate will impact how quick you get feedback on your actions.
With 60Hz, the frames each take 17ms, meaning the next frame will be on average 8.3 ms away. Thus if you perform an ingame action, you will get visual feedback in ~8.3ms, whereas with 120Hz it will come in 4.1ms.
There is probably some kind of buffering done, so likely your action will not end up in the currently drawn frame but the one after that. So the response will on average come 3/2 frames after your action: 25ms later for 60Hz v.s. 12.5 ms for 120Hz. 10ms faster reaction time should be noticeable.",1417461149

Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.<p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.<p>Clever is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 29,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.<p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)<p>Right now we’re a team of 40 people (19 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco (2nd and Mission).  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.

Won&#x27;t this just mean that instead of having a single implementation of a Rocket daemon running as root, there is now one custom one every time it needs to be automated?<p>It&#x27;s great to see this problem broken up into reusable pieces though. It totally makes sense to function without a daemon, especially out of the box.",1417460437

You can somewhat fanwank that into meaning they had to use older, simpler technology to get the capsule itself into orbit, but then could take advantage of the pre-Blight technology already in orbit for the rest of the movie. That&#x27;s about the same as your explanation, though.<p>Pretty weak, so it would be nice if they had at least given us a throwaway sentence or two to wave it away like they did with spaghettification, as the rocket orbital mechanics, at least, were distracting. I imagine the real reason was Nolan wanted to invoke a parallel to the Apollo missions in the liftoff from earth, but didn&#x27;t want to waste time with the very hard problem of getting off other worlds once you get there.",1417460406

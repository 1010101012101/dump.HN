93322,comment,92792,93198,0,0,majimojo,,,"I have to agree with kingkong here.  Organized Horse Archers cannot be beat by any pre-gunpowder army.  People like to the label the mongols as ""The Horde.""  But a Mongol Army of 25k consistently beat armies 5 times its size.  It basically comes down to the fact that they have faster horses than you, and their composite bows have 150% the distance of even the English Long Bow (and can be fired from the saddle).  If your army had these two qualities, what would you do?<p>The downside is that its hard to defend the empire that you've conquered using horse archery.<p>Alexander the Great reputedly defeated Scythian horse archers, but he left no records as to how this is was achieved.  He probably used his companion cavalry to chase the horse archers against a river or into a forest.  Like what the romans did to Hannibal's father.  I think the Egyptians were able to beat the Mongols ONCE but only with superior numbers and a lot of preparation.<p>Anyway, it is USUALLY true that winning a war is about who's side has stronger will to fight.  Who said that?  Xenophon?<p>But tactically, horse archers that always run away cannot be beat. They rain arrows down upon you, burn your farms and supply lines, and taunt your huge 200,000 man armies out to be crushed in a simulatenous attack on all sides by 5 different columns of Horse Archers all arriving at the same time.  They are will-breakers.  Like startups picking away at slow thinking corporations.<p>This is similar to how the Athenians eventually defeated the Spartans by never engaging them in close combat and raining arrows and spears on them.  Tactics.  Not exactly the bravest thing, the Spartans would have called this Womanly fighting.<p>With the advent of gunpowder, artillery, and combined arms.  You can't pull this off anymore.  Thank god.<p>Lesson: Mongols only fight pitched battles they've already won.<p>Although for us startup guys, the point that PG might be impressing is that, its the company with the most determination that wins.  Not the one with the most money/people.<p>kingkong here is implying that tactics and adaptive thinking is the key, not just having a hard head and tunnel vision.",1198878942

93316,comment,93216,93281,0,0,nraynaud,,,"Funny you use this example, because using line input is thing from the past. For me it's a ""smelling"".<p>I often see people demonstrating their point with line input or regexes, both of which are misused 90% of the time.<p>I'm convinced that ruby leads to shorter code at equivalent behavior; however I'm far from convinced that size is everything, because of various remarks of Donald Norman in his excellent book ""the design of everyday things"". For example: ""place constraints in the world and not in the head"", so if the constraint exists, it should be visible (which doesn't imply java type system, we can imagine something shown by the IDE that would not be code). <p>Apart from the language war, there is a community war. I don't use many ""normal"" java tools, because I feel they are dumb. But I feel there is a strong base of low-educated people in the new java-critics community, people that can only count lines, repeat the leader, cannot create new thinking by their own. And this is not new, a few well-intentioned leader get spoiled by dumb masses is common thing everywhere. \nBut this is tragic, because where java (and C#/.net) represented a progress hover the mainstream C and C++ by using explicit typing and collection the last technology in interpretation and GC in a single product, and removing explicit pointer manipulation, python or ruby are nothing new, they are basically old tech languages, with old tech (if not dumb) interpretation. O'caml and Haskell (and the ""new"" bunch of logic/functional language like clean, curry etc.) did propose some innovation. \nO'caml did propose a new balance for generics and side effects (""weak types""), an interesting GC, some new type systems, Haskell proposed some interesting optimizations (massive rewriting thanks to laziness) a new compromise for mixing laziness and side effects, Concurrent Clean too, with its ""unique"" types. <p>The main problem with languages is people, and it has nothing to do with the line count. Because if you count the lines to make your language choice, then you can't criticize your boss when he manages by headcount chopping, when he imposes the new fad of the moment in the project etc. because you entered his system.<p>In my last job we divided the codebase by 5 without changing the language, we mainly trained people (management and ourselves the ""newly hired"" included) and removed stuff (because shit does not only come from development). Doing shit is not a language problem, it's a people problem.",1198877227
93315,comment,93176,93176,0,0,rapind,,,"I think it's doable if you're a smart coder and can find an equally really smart coder in China, India, etc. that's on the same page. Easier said than done of course. But if you can communicate well with the individual, make use of various tools, and can develop a long-term one-on-one relationship you should be able to save some time and money. Win-win for both of you.<p>There's some significant upfront investment though, just like hiring any key employee, and you can't hire someone the day after you realize you need the extra hands. Really doesn't work like that. Think long-term. Think partnership.<p>It's whole new challenge apart from your typical day job. Interesting one though.",1198877132

93310,comment,93176,93176,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We've (Virtualmin) outsourced two tasks so far:<p>Translations.  We met a great guy in China via Elance for the Mandarin work.  We've also worked with people in France.<p>Artwork.  The new Webmin logo was done by a guy in Romania, I think.  Met him on SitePoint via a logo contest.<p>I considered outsourcing some of the JavaScript work, since it's not our core competency (we build system administration tools in Perl/C/Java), but given that UI is so important I opted to learn JavaScript myself.  Our first hire will probably be someone very strong on UI and web technology, though I'm getting pretty comfortable with it lately.<p>My previous company frequently outsourced, but never to China.  I regularly hired my current co-founder (an Australian), and I worked with folks in Germany, Romania, Pakistan, Ukraine, Tunisia, and the US.  Some experiences were positive, others were very negative.  I wouldn't suggest outsourcing without some solid in-house expertise to judge the resulting code.  I had a lot of trouble with really bad security practices in many outsourced projects.  If I weren't a developer myself, I would have merely have had to trust that since it looked like it was working it actually was--when in the case of a couple of projects all of the ""login"" work was being done client-side.  I even had a Firefox toolbar project come back with SQL being generated on the untrusted, unauthenticated, client-side in JavaScript (inserts, deletes, the whole shebang).<p>In short, if you aren't a developer, or don't have one on board, outsourcing is potentially rife with pain.  That said, Digg and MySpace were developed by outsourced labor, and Mark Fletcher is a big fan of Elance.  I dunno that any Chinese developers were involved, though.",1198875625

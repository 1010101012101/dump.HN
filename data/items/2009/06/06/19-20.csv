Startups are projects with clear <i>revenue goals</i>, and relatively detailed plans by which to attain those goals, that the founders expect to turn into some sort of business.<p>Webapps may just be useful and fun distractions without concrete monetization plans and/or goals. They have the potential to grow into startups, but are missing a lot of the other components that go along with it (business planning, revenue projects, goal deadlines, etc.).<p>That said, there's still no absolutely clear delineation. Some may alternate between the two definitions.",1244317787

All relevant to the startup world with the possible exception of #6.<p>> 1. One man can start a movement.<p>> 2. A movement need not be started by the most skilled member of the movement.<p>> 3. When beginning your movement and you look around and no one else is joining the dance, just keep dancing.<p>> 4. When the one guy who joins your movement slowly fades away, keep going.<p>> 5. Before you know it, the people joining your movement won’t even know you started it.<p>> 6. When your movement takes a life of it’s own, just let go. There will be no stopping it.<p>> 7. The very people who are staring at you like your nuts as you movement alone, will be the very same people dancing the hardest in the end.<p>Edit: Here is the link <a href=""http://www.ragamuffinsoul.com/2009/06/youre-bad-idea-may-start-a-movement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ragamuffinsoul.com/2009/06/youre-bad-idea-may-sta...</a>",1244316997

WTF?  Even if I could, the API doesn't seem powerful enough to, say, write a ssh client or port over a real programming langauge (like ECL).

It's not worth the developer effort.<p>(Windows Mobile is closed, but very easy to write software for.  And Android is completely open, and has some of the coolest apps as a result.

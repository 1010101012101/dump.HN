I read the emails and their responses seem perfectly acceptable to me, I am not picking up an arrogant or confrontational tone and think they did their best to answer the issue. The author asserts a copyleft license to the work and fully expects Amazon to be 100% compatible with it (one could almost say arrogantly so) and does not, in my opinion, assert exclusive publishing rights of the work. Amazon state they are not confident author holds the exclusive publishing rights and that this is not acceptable on the Kindle Store, linking to the relevant policy guideline. As someone else has pointed out, the author is also not the customer here, they are in effect negotiating a business deal with Amazon, Amazon do not need to tip-toe around the issue.

4497296,comment,4491766,4496378,3,0,michrassena,,,"I gave this discussion some thought this morning.  Basically the argument boils down to ""it's not an old picture, it's modern, it's been post-processed in Photoshop, recently.  What you're reacting to is a modern photograph""  Correct me if I'm mistaken.<p>If that is the case, I still disagree.  I'll bring the old saw from Ansel Adams that the negative is the score, and the print is the performance.  He reprinted some of his most famous photographs throughout his lifetime, and some of these prints are arguably better than others.  My point being, that since Prokudin-Gorksy isn't around to give us his performance, others have stepped up and created something they feel is analogous to the actual experience and perhaps amped it up a bit for our color-weary eyes.<p>There is no way for us to experience these images in the original without the three lens projector Prokudin-Gorsky used.  With any method, you can claim that the colors and presentation are an artifact of the production process. If I see a beautiful image, sometimes it's apparent that Kodachrome or Velvia had been chosen specifically because of the way they enhance color or saturation.  Would we even be having this discussion in these images had been captured on Kodachrome?<p>I have some idea of what is possible in Photoshop, and I can say with certainty that these images don't ""reek"" of Photoshop in the same way that those on the news stand do, with their plastic women and too-white teeth.  What has been done is the most rudimentary work necessary to render both an image which is both colorful and complete by proper registration of the layers and by some manipulation of the contrast and saturation.  I think that the technicians who put these images together have respected the work and the original intent of the artist (as far as I can suppose it), and have breathed new life into this artifact.  What they have done is less invasive and less manipulative than the restoration of the Last Supper.<p>What puzzles me is this purism.  This sense that Photoshop is so dominant over our visual senses that we cannot see past it and make statements about the work itself.  That it has to be Photoshop that we find colorful, interesting, or worthy of note.<p>Not all viewers are equally naive.  Some find tone-mapped HDR obtrusive, and the halos, contrast inversion and lack of shadows physically sickening.  Some look at HDR and say gee wiz.  I think readers on this site deserve more credit by default than the second category.<p>What I really want to know, is a suggest for fixing this alleged problem, of these images looking like Photoshop.  What is the way to experience these images without that obtrusive technical monster in the way?  What is the pure experience without some monkey at the keyboard interposing their vision on the work?  How can I find myself enamored with the thing in itself, rather than a modern process or technique.  Where is the original artwork, and how do you suggest I experience it?<p>As an aside, I'm very intrigued by your description of Gursky's photo being full of mind-bending and subtle tricks.  What is unnatural about the space? I see what looks like compression, possibly by the use of a long lens.  The lake should not be sunlit without the ground before and after being sunlit, unless there are some particularly rectangular clouds overhead.  Some items have been cloned out, but I haven't been to the site or seen photographs of it to know what. Essentially, what is the visual signature that is present in this photo by Gurksy that is present in the Prokudin-Gorksy photos?  I'm just not seeing it.  I'd love to see a mockup in Photoshop that would simulate how you think the Prokudin-Gorsky images should look, or does the mere use of Photoshop somehow make it impossible to create an approximation of the ideal look of this work.",1347230383

SF is inherently not going to have the character of an east coast city because the hills provide natural divisions in development. San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods, each with their own character, and it's probably most reasonable to look at development on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. Increasing the density in Pac Heights is never going to happen, but building a residential high-rise in the FiDi? Look at the Transbay Terminal project. <a href=""http://www.sfredevelopment.org/index.aspx?page=54"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfredevelopment.org/index.aspx?page=54</a>.

As long as office space and residential stay within the right balance, the mix should be sustainable. The goal should not be to make every city look like Manhattan. The suburb I grew up in effectively ran out of land, demand increased in the next town out, and it got built up. There is no real shortage of land in CA as a whole - It doesn't take much of a road trip from SF to find an area where cows outnumber people, and it's reasonable that groups of people are able to define the character of an area in which they live.<p>The slippery slope view argument doesn't really hold water, largely because much of the city was built a century ago, long before the current residents settled there. Zoning restrictions caused views to be priced into the value of the property. Current owners bought their properties largely with the view-restrictions intact. You buy something, you know what the view you have, you know what view you don't have, you know what restrictions there are on what you can do with your property, and it's priced accordingly. It's a reasonable system for all.<p>I do second your suggestion of better regional planning as a whole, though, mostly with regards to transportation, though the Bay Area is better than most in that regard.",1347230238

4497226,comment,4495914,4497030,7,0,henrikschroder,,,">  if mere possession is illegal then demand is reduced.<p>Except that's not true. Previously in Sweden, production and distribution of child porn was illegal, while possession was legal. But ten years ago or so, through lobbying and some shrill ""think of the children!"" campaigns, our politicians decided to change it and make possession illegal. This actually required constitutional change, since the basic freedom of the press had to be changed.<p>And the change was made, even though a lot of professionals objected to it. Lawyers were upset, because they generally thought you shouldn't tamper with the constitution unless you had <i>really</i> good reasons to. The police were negative, because they couldn't see how it would help them catch more actual criminals. The prosecutors were negative since distribution and production are enough to catch the criminals you want to catch. And the journalists were against it for the reasons linked to in the article. But think of the children! And so the law was changed.<p>Now, 10 years afterwards, the result of the change is exactly as the professionals predicted: The law change hasn't done anything. There's no great reduction is child porn cases. The people they do catch are all guilty of distribution or production, possession is irrelevant. Journalists are pissed and more cautious of the subject. And there's been a few idiotic cases where people have been convicted even though its obvious they shouldn't have been. Like a manga critic who was reported by his pissed ex-wife, and when the police searched his place they could kinda see how two books (out of a huge collection) maybe depicted underage people, so they had to arrest him. I think he got acquitted after appealing though, it seems higher courts have a more sane view of the matter.<p>And then you have more common worries, for example what about digitizing old photo albums? I have photos of myself, one year old, bathing, naked. Maybe I should just burn that photo to be sure? What about taking digital pictures or movies of your own children, and they happen to be naked somewhere. Post to Facebook? Or oh shit, delete as fast as you can?<p>So, making possession illegal did not in any way change the situation for actual pedophiles distributing actual child porn. They're still as guilty as before, and still breaking the law as before, but regular people are affected by it, journalists are affected by it, and the copyright maximalists are using it to push their agenda. And that's a pretty strong argument for making possession legal again.",1347229190

4497202,comment,4496694,4496694,24,0,cletus,,,"San Francisco is now for all intents and purposes a boom town.<p>At one end of the spectrum it is awash with tech money from the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. On the other you have pretty much everyone else.<p>I'm familiar with this coming from Perth, Western Australia. Australia is undergoing an unprecedented resources boom thanks to China's insatiable appetite for metals and petroleum products. This has affected different parts of the country differently. Perth, Brisbane and some region centers have ridden this wave for more than a decade.<p>On one side you have those who have owned property for this entire time who are sitting on huge windfalls (eg a house you could buy for $85,000 in 2001 cost $350,000 by 2005). Now you won't find a house cheaper than $250,000 in the Perth metropolitan area which stretches for 100 miles of coast and 50 miles inland (at peak; it's in between a triangle and a semicircle).<p>To view this is a positive is ultimately shortsighted. You see, it's incredibly difficult for new people entering the market. And I'm not just talking about purchasing. It flows on to renting. Those rents are inputs into all other costs and this all adds up to an inflation bomb just waiting to explode.<p>The ""haves"" in Australia are those associated with mining and construction (since mining demands a lot of infrastructure). The ""have nots"" are everyone else. The have nots are, at best, asset rich and cash poor.<p>At some point the economy simply ceases to function. Office space is incredibly expensive in Perth such that, for example, there are fewer and fewer software engineering jobs as companies relocate or centralize to Sydney and Melbourne (exacerbating a natural trend), which incidentally is one of the reasons I moved a couple of years ago.<p>Honestly I think it's cheaper for me to live in Manhattan than anywhere central in Perth now. <i>Manhattan</i>. Rents are more expensive here but not by much. Everything else is cheaper. I can walk into a large number of eateries and have appetizers for <$5 and entres for <$10, just as one data point. Utilities in Perth are super-expensive. I know people with $1500 electricity bills... for <i>two months</i>.<p>Now Perth isn't land-contrained like San Francisco (or Manhattan) for that matter but the socialist bent in SF is ultimately a problem.<p>Rent control is a huge problem in SF. This has been covered here previously. Some estimates run at 1 in 8 rentable units being left permanently vacant, arguably due to rent control.<p>The city's building restrictions mean new units simply aren't entering the market.<p>NYC has several things going for it here:<p>1. It did away with rent control in 1973. It provided a smooth landing with rent stabilization, which is now rapidly disappearing from Manhattan;<p>2. Manhattan has excellent transport links, probably the best in the country. The fact is if you work in Manhattan, you can live in the five boroughs, New Jersey, upstate New York, Long Island or even further afield without having to drive into the city.<p>Compare this to the woeful transport situation (in comparison) in the Bay area. Caltrain is barely serviceable and at best runs once or twice an hour.<p>3. New York allows new construction, at least in some areas. Financial district, Battery Park, Midtown West, etc;<p>4. The surrounding areas of NYC are more densely populated. Compare this to, say, Menlo Park, which reserves almost all land for single-family residences on large blocks and like much of the rest of the Valley, virtually prohibits high-rise construction.<p>This low density is ultimately shortsighted as it comes at the expensive of amenities and will at some point impact the ability for employers to stay in the area as the rising property prices make commercial activity increasingly untenable.<p>5. The geography doesn't help SF. Whereas New York, London and other densely populated urban centers can expand in multiple directions, SF is more constricted.<p>Facebook really wanted to stay in Palo Alto. Zoning restrictions made it difficult. They had split offices and eventually had to move. Twitter for some reason is sticking to SoMA but as the seedier areas gentrify and go up in cost, this is going to become increasingly difficult.

4497183,comment,4495914,4495914,1,0,sunnysunday,,,"Some time ago, thanks to a tip on HN,  I was listening to a interview with Stanley Kubrick recorded in the 1960's in New York.  He's a genius in the opinion of many, myself included, so I was happy for the tip.  This is what makes HN worth reading.<p>In the interview, one of the films that was mentioned a few times was Lolita (1962).  This is one Kubrick film I have never seen.  So I did a little research on it.<p>It's based on a novel from 1955 by Vladmir Nabokov.  It just so happens this is one of best-selling novels of all-time, in the ""50-100 million copies sold"" bracket, according to Wikipedia.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books.html</a><p>It's also listed as one of the best novels of all-time on the Random House web site.  Top 5 I think.  I believe it was also selected as on of the best books of all-time in a survey of a book club in Norway, if my memory is correct.  But don't take my word as fact.  Check these sources yourself; they are linked from Wikipedia.<p><a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html</a><p>What is the subject of the book?  That's left for the curious reader to discover.  You might be surprised.  I certainly was.<p>Remember, this book was published in 1955.<p>Also, though I might not thnk highly of the ""messenger"", the message in this thread about the ""market"" for videos of murder was thought-provoking.  There was a terrible film about five years ago about this subject, starring Diane Lane.\nThe film is centered around the Hollywood's version of the internet, so it's a little painful to watch.  But the whole premise of the film was the most disturbing.  Why was this film even made?  And why the heck does Diane Lane want to star in it?<p>Then there's the recent story of a young person who worked as an independent contractor reviewing uploaded content for Google (Picasa, YouTube, etc.).  From the sort of things he was exposed to, he ended up needing psychological treatment.<p>No one should have to watch this stuff.  But even more important, no one should _want_ to watch this stuff.  The question is: Why do people want to watch violence and murder?<p>Maybe we should as Arnold whatever his name is, the Terminator.<p>Hypocrisy abounds.",1347228345

I see it as a Control key for GUI operations, leaving my actual Control key free for doing things in my Terminal.

Control-A has never seemed difficult to me, at least with this arrangement, but I'm not a home row typist (or an Emacs user -- I just use the Emacs bindings in text boxes and terminals).<p>Otherwise this more or less mirrors my experience, although mine was ~7 years ago (so the Linux desktop environment was even less mature at the time).

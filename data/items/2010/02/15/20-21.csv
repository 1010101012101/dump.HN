About 1% of the population produces all our food.  And that frees the rest of us up to make movies.  And write novels.  And organize the world's information.  And allow people to live 30 miles from their jobs.  And let them cross the country or travel the world on a whim.  And live in climate-controlled boxes with nice furniture.<p>That's also the long-term solution to unemployment.  Eventually, somebody figures out something else that the rest of the population would like to have, and puts all of those out-of-work workers to work doing it.  The computer industry didn't even exist 50 years ago.  The automobile and household appliance industries didn't exist 50 years before that.  The oil, railroad, middle management, engineering, and office worker industries didn't exist 50 years before that.  These have all been born out of workers being freed up from previous shrinking industries (eg. manufacturing, domestic servants, farming, textiles) and put to use in new emerging ones.",1266267388

Im guessing most people will agree here that ideas are fairly worthless - execution is everything. It is a matter of opinion whether Facebook executed them better. Onwards again...<p><i>3. Google has excellent privacy record and Facebook is a disaster. \nMost folks do not trust Zuckerberg and Facebook any more because of \ntheir privacy record (filled with lawsuits) and because they steal \nevery good idea they see (i.e. Twitter’s innovations and FourSquare’s \nchecking in).</i><p>Probably a fair point; though Google has had problems in the past Facebook's have been much more public (for the average user). Irrespective of that the security idiocy this time round in the launch of Buzz means previous good will has the potential to go out the window. Even if you still trust Google with your privacy (which I still do, as it happens) the <i>product</i> Buzz is going to be heavily tainted from the outset. This will damage pickup for Google.<p><i>4. Google Buzz auto generates your network–this is MUCH better \nprocess than Facebook’s.</i><p>This is probably the crux of the thing. Yeh it didnt work out well and the new way is no better than Facebook offers. But I think it misses the point and ignores the only really clear argument he could make: google has the content. They have a LOT of content, lots and lots. And most of it is great. it's different content to Facebook (and stuff I am more interested in as it happens) and there is scope in the future for a wider variety of content too.<p><i>5. Google Buzz is way faster than the sluggish Facebook–this is a \nHUGE advantage.</i>\nCan't comment as I never properly tried Buzz for any length of time - but again this is somewhat subjective.<p><i>6. Google Buzz puts relies and updates into your GMAIL as \nthreads–this is BRILLIANT and a HUGE advantage.</i><p>Hmm. I dont think Buzz really fits into an Inbox style workflow - I actually think this is it's biggest flaw.<p>Ultimately comparing Facebook to Buzz is difficult - they serve different purposes and hold a lot of different content, despite occupying similar arena's.",1266267261
1127462,comment,1127040,1127405,0,0,rbranson,,,"Good point, but don't ignore the opportunity created on a continuous basis because of these ""Uscan machine"" scenarios.<p>The extra value created here can be traded for things that would have previously been unattainable, which in turn grows other industries and markets. A good example is the relatively recently materialized cell phone industry, which was viewed as a luxury not but 15 years ago, and is now practically ubiquitous. This has added $40-$100/mo to the average functional adults expenditures. While it may have replaced the $50/mo spent on the home phone line, you're replacing that with $40-$100/mo for each person in the home. Mobile phones increase our productivity by saving time and nowadays allow us to make more informed decisions on the spot.<p>This example continues because there was a fundamental shift in the type of labor employed by these mobile phone companies. In the early days of the industry, specialized salespeople pulled large salaries selling expensive phones and highly trained technical people answered technical support calls. Now that costs have dropped massively and reliability has drastically improved, these people have been replaced by relatively low wage employees (customer service reps and salespeople), and opportunity has opened at the ""bottom.""<p>I do agree that we waste a ridiculous amount of our capital on societal ""overhead"" that could otherwise be put to good use.",1266267253

Yes, historically it was valuable, but times have changed. A lot.<p>God help those who are long on gold once we start asteroid mining. Be sure to dump your gold holdings before then, ideally several years before; once the market figures out what that means gold will plunge even before the asteroid gold hits the market.

They won't be in manufacturing -- robots will hold all the manufacturing jobs. They won't be in the service sector (where most new jobs are now) -- robots will work in all the restaurants and retail stores. They won't be in transportation -- robots will be driving everything. They won't be in security (robotic police, robotic firefighters), the military (robotic soldiers), entertainment (robotic actors), medicine (robotic doctors, nurses, pharmacists, counselors), construction (robotic construction workers), aviation (robotic pilots, robotic air traffic controllers), office work (robotic receptionists, call centers and managers), research (robotic scientists), education (robotic teachers and computer-based training), programming or engineering (outsourced to India at one-tenth the cost), farming (robotic agricultural machinery), etc. We are assuming that the economy is going to invent an entirely new category of employment that will absorb half of the working population.<p>Why isn't the economy creating those new jobs now? Today there are millions of unemployed people. There are also tens of millions of people who would gladly abandon their minimum wage jobs scrubbing toilets, flipping burgers, driving trucks and shelving inventory for something better. This imaginary new category of employment does not hinge on technology -- it is going to employ people, after all, in massive numbers -- it is going to employ half of today's working population. Why don't we see any evidence of this new category of jobs today?</i><p>I don't find some of his examples (robotic scientists?) particularly persuasive, but the idea that many low skilled jobs will be destroyed while few high skill jobs created... seems at least plausible to me. That this has never happened before isn't a particularly good argument why it couldn't happen in the future.",1266265835

I believe precisely the reason America is so successful is because of debt.<p>A worker who does not work a day never gains that day of work back.  Debt allows workers to perform their tasks fully allocated as there is always work available, whether or not work has already been done in return for them.<p>Ie if there was no debt, everyone would have to wait for a task to be finished before they could perform a service in return, causing lost work that can never be made up for.<p>The only time this system falls flat is if everyone decides they need services all at once, which historically is not common.",1266264419
1127346,comment,1126894,1126894,0,0,rantfoil,,,"I think the biggest problem most college grads who are applying for jobs face is that they don't really think about what employers need. Getting a job is the first real step into the ""real world"" where there aren't rote and well-trod paths to success. Many new grads treat applying for jobs as a kind of application process -- fill out my apps (resumes and cover letters) and then see what sticks. Why? Because _I_ need a job. Bzzt, wrong answer.<p>In contrast, the ideal candidate is <i>passionate</i> about whatever job they're going for. Make lists of companies that you would love to work at, and pursue them directly, whether there's a job listing open or not. Recruiters use LinkedIn to find candidates all the time... it is just as valuable for new grads just entering the workforce.<p>When pitching for startup funds, there's a saying: When you ask for money, you get advice. When you get advice, you get money. This applies to jobs too. People love talking about themselves and what they do. Luckily, if you're new, you stand to gain from that, and massively.<p>Finally, it pays to be prepared for interviews. I was just having dinner with a friend who's a producer at the biggest name game studio out there -- he was just complaining about how he'll ask if the candidate has played _____ game, and it'll be to the level of 'I tried the demo.' Trying the demo isn't good enough. Becoming a Level 32 Dwarf or thereabouts is probably what it takes, at least for this example.<p>Hiring managers, no matter what field, want to know that the person in front of them is a) smart, b) gets things done, and c) would love more than anything to work for them.",1266264399

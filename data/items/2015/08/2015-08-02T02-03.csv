It&#x27;s interesting to see that the debt to gdp ratio is CH is astronomically high.  Three times that of the US with a GDP that is 26 TIMES smaller.  While the budget is balanced right now it seems that a huge amount of debt has been piled-up, perhaps to support the standard of living?  This is conjecture on my part, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Clearly in the US we can do a lot better.  And we do this by voting the right people into office.  We are at a point where fiscal responsibility isn&#x27;t an interesting concept but rather a requirement for survival.  What we have been doing is not sustainable in the long term, not even close.  So, tax and spend needs to go out the window.  And no, we can&#x27;t fix it by taxing the rich.<p>The differences are huge and, while it might feels good to write a blog post trashing the US, the reality is that nobody --blog post writers and people posting comments on HN-- ever seems to want to take a few hours to throw numbers up on a spreadsheet, build some economic models and try to understand the underlying data.  That&#x27;s where the truth lies.  Not in how we feel.  That&#x27;s all bullshit.  Everybody feels great just before a tsunami.  Yet, the earthquake that triggers it has been building-up underground for years, for decades or centuries.  What matters are the numbers.  Most everything else is complete nonsense.<p>I&#x27;d like someone to explain the impact of a per-capita debt of over $150K and 229% of GDP on the People&#x27;s Republic of Switzerland.  A house of cards looks great until the reality that is happens to be a house of cards has to be confronted.<p>Don&#x27;t argue with me with feelings or ideology.  Put numbers up on a spreadsheet and figure it first.<p>In the end, we are all bailing water in one way or the other.  And a lot of what&#x27;s going on points very solidly at China, in more ways than one.",1438483476

All the user-testing showed that general users (ie non-developers-or-techies) found many aspects of the Linux user-experience too complex. So a lot of time was spent simplifying all sorts of aspects of Ubuntu so that it could be used by more general users. I know because I saw user-interface report after report. Furthermore, having a single user-experience across your different classes is trying to be user-centric. It&#x27;s true that since there were three code-bases &#x27;unifying&#x27; to one base was a key goal at an engineering level.<p>That doesn&#x27;t deny your point that Unity is less suited to users who prefer the traditional Linux window manager experience e.g focus-follow-mouse.",1438483418

9989526,comment,9987495,9987495,0,0,mettamage,,,"Empathy<p>The book Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan the best book I know. It describes scientifically studied exercises of the mind that you can do by yourself. It will boost your empathy much higher than anything I&#x27;ve experienced (or read about on Sciencedaily). It explains the science too and you can look it up. One thing though, reading the book is part 1, part 2 is performing the exercises. If you won&#x27;t perform the exercises, then reading the book has not much of a purpose.<p>In my experience, I got to amazing levels of empathy by doing these exercises. I felt like I had godlike skills. My intuition could immediately signal me if a woman liked me (first time ever in my life). Two months later I was in a relationship. I could spot feelings that my friends had that they were not aware of.<p>There are some caveats though, which goes for any book that will be presented here. The moment I stopped practicing, my level got down a bit above baseline before I started. So most structural gains are hard to keep, which goes for any trained skill. Another downside is that everything you see has a bigger impact on you. So when you&#x27;d go to an action movie, you&#x27;d feel like you&#x27;re right in it. When you look at a rose you feel like you&#x27;re a rose, that sort of thing. When you drink one sip of alcohol you feel the effect of it already on your perception in very subtle ways (that might be a good thing though).<p>Some final thoughts: I believe books train deliberation aka the slow system. Exercises, mental or physical, train the fast system. Checkout Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. I believe it&#x27;s a useful approximation to how thinking works. Also, while empathy is a big component in becoming better, it&#x27;s not the only component.",1438483338

Convox also supports streaming logs, which is pretty awesome (although, coming soon to Empire too :)). Convox is a little more reliant on AWS, whereas Empire was designed to be able to work with other backends like Kubernetes for example (not implemented yet).

The project consist of a set of shields to interface with the electronics; a harness to connect the shield to the different components and the Arduino program that control delivery of fuel to a engine as well as reading a lambda sensor, controlling a fuel pump and read the throttle sensor.
Right now even when I got it to work reliable I stopped the project momentarily due to a gas station that filled my tank with bad gas killing the lambda sensor.
It&#x27;s on my bucket list to get it to work with industrial quality.<p>&quot;I think it is going to be incredibly valuable for companies to have somebody that can span both the software and hardware engineering, and it sounds to me like that is where your interests lie.&quot;<p>You may be right, it&#x27;s kinda difficult in my case due to market limitations on my country (Guatemala) but I think I would like on that environment.",1438482729

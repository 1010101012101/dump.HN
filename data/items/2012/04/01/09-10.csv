All the pejorative ""this vs. that"" statements you could write about a programmer and what their ""environment encourages.""<p>I imagined it. And?<p>There are places where programmers are treated as commodity, and there are places where programmers are prized possessions, and same holds for design, business, sales or any other stream of work. If I feel that all I need is someone to do a $25 logo because basically I don't give a shit about the logo and code is what that matters, it's totally my prerogative. I am under no obligation to appease random people's sense of entitlement.<p>If you run a design shop or are one of those ""idea guys"" who need a code monkey to do the easy job of coding so that you can work on the hard parts, would I do it? Fuck no. But that doesn't mean there aren't people who would do it or you are wrong to have such expectations.<p>I don't know why people feel that the whole world owe them something, and complain about being prosecuted when their perceived debt isn't paid.",1333274242

3783258,comment,3780764,3780764,1,0,sassafras,,,"The New York Times article the post initially links to is a lot more interesting. Besides debunking formal brainstorming processes, it also points out the increasing necessity of creative group work, as well as strategies that are quite effective.  Examples include MIT's chaotic Building 20, and the sweet spot of ""familiar but not too familiar"" in hit Broadway musical teams.<p>Perhaps Agile with a capital A does hold something in common with the formal technique of brainstorming. The key point of the Lehrer piece is that in order for group creativity to flourish you need to foster debate and disagreement, not just uncritical free association in a conference room.  And even then, it's good not to put too much formal process in place, because the best interactions are unscripted.  But this in turn solidifies the need for work spaces that maximize the chance for these encounters.",1333274114

If you have the skills and content the investor or employer is looking for, they will easily look past what you are wearing and whether it's authentic or fake.  Mark Zuckerberg didn't dress up for investor pitches, but was able to raise money right?  I also tend to think if Zuckerberg had put on some nice clothes, he still would've been able to raise money even if it was obvious it wasn't his normal attire.<p>- I've hired a lot of people over the years into both startup and larger companies from engineers to sales people, and it was usually obvious if someone was ""faking"" their appearance.  Never have I thought ""Boy, this person is being inauthentic and fake, I should not hire them"".  I've always seen it as a sign of respect that they took the effort.  At the same time, I would not think worse of someone who didn't dress up, because I also realize that it's them as people that matter.<p>- Bottom line: Be yourself, and if being yourself means wearing your normal clothes, that's fine.

That is a common trend I have noticed - there is some class of dev whose job becomes serving the internal business on an adhoc basis<p>your manager can either stop it by charging your time back to the requestor ( I would suggest you track the requests -send emails sayi g Bob you wanted a new sales report, it's third on list and expect it 9am)<p>or he can explicitly Market you to the business - what I previously did.  And it is a powerful weapon for your manager.  The higher ups feel well treated and the department gets all it's interrupts funnelled thru one person, who in your case seems good at it and happy to do it<p>but I strongly suggest you track the work, and push the marketing value of what you do.",1333271849

So do lots of other folk I know - including some of the people who actually started the whole agile thing (there was a long and tedious thread on the XP list on the topic if anybody cares to read up - see <a href=""http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/msearch?query=+Introverts%2C+Agile+and+Creativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/msearc...</a>)<p>As others have pointed out, no agile process that I am aware of recommends open plan offices. Open plan offices suck. What many in the agile community do recommend is having team rooms - where everybody working on a particular sits together.<p>In fact the only agile process I'm aware of that makes <i>any</i> explicit statement on working environment is XP - which has having per-project team rooms as one of it's practices (the primary practice of ""Sit together"" In XP2E)<p>And there's a lot of actual evidence that the team-room way of working is very, very effective. See this quora answer of mine for some references <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Is-having-all-the-startup-engineers-work-at-the-same-room-a-good-thing-or-not/answer/Adrian-Howard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Is-having-all-the-startup-engineers-wor...</a>, and the agile alliance guide has some references too <a href=""http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/teamroom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/teamroom.html</a>. Especially the ""Offices That Work"" paper that has some nice info on the relative trade-offs.<p>I find it curious that so many folk focus on individual performance - when most development is a team sport. I don't care if I'm a little less productive as an individual by a few project-related interruptions if the overall productivity of the team I'm working on improves.",1333270863

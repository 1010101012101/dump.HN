6501219,comment,6500577,6500972,4,0,tribe,,,"Well there was some mention.<p>> We can probably add software to that list: early software engineering work found that, dismayingly, bug rates seem to be simply a function of lines of code, and one would expect diseconomies of scale. So one would expect that in going from the ~4,000 lines of code of the Microsoft DOS operating system kernel to the ~50,000,000 lines of code in Windows Server 2003 (with full systems of applications and libraries being even larger: the comprehensive Debian repository in 2007 contained ~323,551,126 lines of code) that the number of active bugs at any time would be fairly large. This lead to predictions of doom and spurred much research into automated proof-checking, static analysis, and functional languages<p>Of course, you need to be pretty confident in your proof-checker. If we aren&#x27;t totally sure about machine-proof methods, then we comback to the &quot;Doomsday hypothesis&quot; at the end of the article, where many results are invalidated at once.",1380992346

Retraining of skills is something I&#x27;ve had to do a lot of times over the last 25 years that I&#x27;ve been doing programming.  The way you overcome this problem is: 1) look at what kind of job you want. 2) Do independent work that you can show off to recruiters and developers as a point of discussion.

(Numbers here just for illustration...)<p>Basically, how in the world do you account for the massive drop in actual realized revenue?  Where does the money come from without raising the taxes further up the chain?<p>Extremely simple example:<p>Person A pays $0 in taxes per year.\nPerson B pays $1 in taxes per year.\nPerson C pays $5 in taxes per year.\nPerson D pays $10 in taxes per year.<p>If we give each of them $1 back from the tax coffers, the total tax paid now goes from $16/year, to $12/year. Does the elimination of existing welfare programs entirely cover this gap, or does one have to raise the tax rate on the higher earners to cover the spread, and would not simply withholding payments from the top earners make more sense than forcing them to give up their income only to give it back to them at the end of the year?<p>Personally, I&#x27;d be upset if I was forced to give my money to the government at 0% interest, only to know they were going to give it back to me at the end of the year.  From the first quarter&#x27;s contribution, I would have lost money on that due to inflation without the opportunity to offset it via investment.

Given that it&#x27;s a somewhat rigid machine, with appendages that have alimited range of motion, maybe it targets, the smallest most effective movements?<p>I would also wonder: What is the net energy consumed from it&#x27;s power source, to cycle one limb, moving it from fully contracted to fully extended and back again? You would need to test this unloaded in free air, and completely loaded under the weight of the entire robot at rest. And that test would not account for the amount of work it would take to safely absorb the full weight ofthe robot, while it&#x27;s moving at 20MPH, to bring it to a full stop, with a single limb.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if those sorts of efficiencies are anything more than a simple practical concern in a prototype, given that the only goal is to run some quick, untethered tests in a parking lot, but it might be relevant to a small degree.<p>This is just my amateur guesswork, though.",1380988836

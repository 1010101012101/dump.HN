By hard-coding them, as in the example code?<p>I believe that it can go from basic reading comprehension to more advanced by adding many rules but of course manually adding them is not very feasible or scaleable.<p>> In my opinion, the fuzzy, statistical methods @davesullivan mentions have a better chance at generalizing (although they may well be augmented by rules-based AI).<p>I agree that a statistical model would be better since it will be able to handle more complexity.

In fact, you would probably have to pay for the services around them, as with a safe-deposit box, so in some sense they would have negative interest.  That&#x27;s the price of being able to demand the money at any point.  Banks would compete on the lowest price for this (and likely pass the cost through to point-of-sale surcharges.)<p>The core point is that the banks cannot commit fraud: they cannot tell all of us that we can have our money at any point and then not be able to deliver.<p>> &quot;duration matching&quot; sounds like those deposits are participants in the loan (e.g. share the risk)?<p>The idea is that banks can make profits on loans, but not by introducing double-counting of money at a given time-point, which is what they do now.  (This is why bank runs are possible.)  The participants still share default risk, which is hopefully covered by collateralization.  If a bank fails to deliver on a given payment, they go into default like a normal business, and they have to strictly demonstrate that they can meet all time-dollar commitments without double-counting any money.  Profits are earned via excess interest and I would imagine that well run banks would maintain a positive reserve on top of their commitment curve.<p>> &quot;citizens dividend for economic stimulus&quot; not sure about this one?<p>The government issues debt-free money or takes cash-flow from public entities like utilities and distributes it directly to the citizens.  This serves as a way to broadly distribute monetary expansion, rather than putting money into the financial system or to favored constituents, with the attendant early-reciever and corruption problems.<p>It&#x27;s not a system without flaws and it would be gut-wrenching to move to it.  However it does have the advantage that it will never be implemented, so I will never be proven wrong.  Perfect!  ;)",1442602355

In the end, you are also putting weight sensors, which are fairly notorious for being fiddly, in a bunch of chairs.  The wider you have to make the margin or error, the more false positives you&#x27;ll get.  I imagine an a medium size casino there&#x27;s a lot of people that weigh ~180 lbs.  In the end, it&#x27;s a passive tracking system, where you get data events and then try to classify them, which I think is more error prone than actively tracking the people themselves through other means. With as many cameras as they have, it probably easier (at this point) to just make sure they always overlap, and have a motion tracking algorithm track people across the video feeds.",1442602087

Model checkers, design-level proofs, design-by-contract, static analysis... these are all techniques with good tooling available that will get you 80-90% the way there. The other 10-20% can be difficult or impossible. That&#x27;s what projects like seL4 aim at.<p>The advice I give on this stuff is to use tech such as this (or above list) on the most critical portions. For instance, the underlying kernel, the key middleware (eg TCP, Protocol Buffers), the type system of the language, the compiler, long-term software like SSL, and so on. Effort is made once that continues to pay off in numerous uses while being incrementally extended. Modularity, careful API design, and layering make modifications easier as proven in Orange Book B3/A1 systems.<p>So, you build it then keep reusing it. Older, security kernels were used in VPN&#x27;s, firewalls, databases, messaging systems (esp mail guards), primitive desktops (esp console), thin clients, and so on. New one&#x27;s can be used similarly... are by Green Hills and Sirrix IIRC. Middleware part is extremely important, though, as even MILS kernel vendors admit (and develop). Best route is to combine: kernels like this; components written in safe subsets amenable to static analysis; middleware synthesized w/ security checks from specs and constraints; CPU or board support packages whose implementation details are hidden behind interfaces w/ their own verification done. Pieces of that are already deployed or verified. Just need an integrated version that&#x27;s also OSS.<p>Then, the rest of the developers can use Rust, Ada, Eiffel, whatever on top of these. If there&#x27;s runtimes, they should be similarly verified.",1442601879

It out performs or matches the current gold standard, without requiring the cache holds evicted keys as those policies do (doubles or triples the physical size). Instead it uses a 4-bit CountMinSketch to record the historic frequency and two LRU queues to balance temporal workloads (high/low frequency + high time locality). This approach is simpler, fast, and much more memory efficient.<p>By moving to a policy that knows which entries are hot, a fast path read could be added to skip policy maintenance for the hottest entries. This could improve performance by 2-3x on a Zipf workload (typical) and has minimal impact on the hit rate.<p>We&#x27;re hoping to publish a paper on this new policy. I&#x27;m currently integrating it into the cache (but already implemented in the simulator).",1442601215

[0]<p>>> Once a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.<p>It&#x27;s quite useful to have a name - a label - for this sort of behaviour. In this case, the means by which VW optimised for this metric was crafty computer software! A metric is only as good as the cost of the unintended consequences that come with imposing it on people, in particular large corporations.<p>I am not surprised that this is done by many corporations as mentioned elsewhere in the comments (ATI/Nvidia etc). This is because regulations and benchmarks that can be gamed, such as engine efficiency, <i>will</i> be gamed because the incentives of corporations work out that way:<p>(I hope this isn&#x27;t perceived as an anti-corporate rant because it&#x27;s not. Just a way of framing facts).<p>For regulations imposed on large corporations in general (think EPA admissions standards):<p>1) Regulations are mandated by a government to effect some purpose (stop destroying Earth)<p>2) Executives - the people running the corporations - are <i>bound by legal responsibility</i> - their fiduciary duty [1] - to create value for their shareholders (selling lots of cars, and profitably).<p>3) Regulations can obstruct the activities of a corporation by making them do things they don&#x27;t want to (making efficient cars is hard and costly and affects the bottom line - its cheaper to manufacture a car with less platinum [2] in it)<p>4) Companies are incentivized to minimize the time and money spent on adhering to regulations<p>5) Once a regulation is standardised and codified, it becomes possible to follow the letter of it, while ignoring the spirit of it. All a corporation has to do is meet the metrics in the specification to abide by the regulation - in other words - game the system.<p>Given these incentives, we have seen that corporations prefer to abide by regulations in the maximally efficient way: gaming them. Thus reducing a well-meaning government initiative to gamesmanship.<p>Kudos to the EPA for calling VW out on this.

It chronicles the discovery of a very interesting historical possibility. While doing so, it also explores the interplay between the personal and professional lives of a very accomplished researcher.<p>I love the theme of how discovery and research are the source of both melancholy and ecstasy. Gopnik herself seems to have found fulfillment and an escape from other troubles in the exciting new questions she encountered about Hume&#x27;s influences. The other side of the same coin is Hume&#x27;s depression during the period when he found himself incapable of making significant progress on his thesis.<p>> &quot;When you’re young, you want things: work, love, children. When you reach middle age, you want to want things. When you’re depressed, you no longer want anything. Desire, hope, the future itself—all seem to vanish, as they had for me. But now I at least wanted to know whether Hume could have heard about Desideri. It was a sign that my future might return.&quot;<p>The other theme of interest to the tech community is the interplay of personal and professional lives. If you consider the two aspects of one&#x27;s life, personal relationships and professional fulfillment, each provides a hedge against possible problems with the other. Interesting explorations in one&#x27;s work can help pull one from other problems in life.<p>There is a significant time-varying component of probabilistic luck in whether one&#x27;s life and work will be fulfilling, but I think it makes sense to constantly strive to bias these probabilities towards outcomes that involve working on exciting projects and building meaningful personal relationships.<p>I think this article is a strong descriptive companion to Zach Weinersmith&#x27;s popular comic about &#x27;eleven lifetimes&#x27; <a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722</a>",1442601033

The recommendations I gave her were for kernel up mainly for isolation. Drivers should be written robustly, synthesized, use trusted hardware, and/or mediate the hardware.<p>re x86 vs ARM. It&#x27;s true. Remember, though, that I didn&#x27;t tell her to use seL4: just re-use work in L4 family projects like Nizza or OKL4 to get their security + performance benefits. The idea is you get a good start, make sure you can swap in/out components, and someone puts a verified one in place later. This is <i>exactly</i> the approach GenodeOS team took along with using many things I recommended in other post. Only gripe with them is they&#x27;re doing too many things at once rather than focusing on getting at least one in best, production mode.<p>That said, I agree with keeping off x86. I&#x27;ve recommended ARM, MIPS, SPARC, and RISC-V for future work. SPARC is nice due to open specs, no licensing past $99 trademark, and GPL hardware available. RISC-V people building all kinds of things. SPARC and MIPS have already been modified for enhanced security by academics several times over. So, SPARC (esp Gaisler), MIPS, and RISC-V are my recommendations in that order putting usability/extensibility over pricing.<p>re pragmatic approach. Sure, I agree with that part. The resulting approach combined things top on the CVE list onto a platform she published exploits for and criticized in other posts. Gotta wonder how far its security would go. ;) She was a good bug-hunter, though, when she understood how something worked. Didn&#x27;t seem to understand strong, security engineering so I predicted QubesOS would be good for vanilla malware w/ some containment of advanced attacks. Basically, a nice improvement on and replacement for Compartmented Mode Workstations&#x27;s. The TCB size and implementation are just too complex for high security.<p>re secure browsers. For full-featured experience, you&#x27;ll need either virtualization or my old KVM-switch method. More research in the former has only made the latter look more trustworthy over time haha. Anyway, I referenced a number of more-secure browser architectures in the comment below. Enjoy seeing variations of The Right Thing in action. :) Now, if only mainstream would put effort into improving those instead of the monolithic ones. Chrome was at least an OP-inspired attempt.

The statistical power of n=5 humans is quite low.</i><p>A few points are important to consider.<p>First, I was only talking about <i>experimental</i> studies searching causal relationships. There are other possible designs, for example field studies (e.g. &quot;school district A gets the new math curriculum, school district B the old one. Which one fares better?&quot;) or simple population observations (&quot;people playing golf live longer than the average population.&quot;). Each design has advantages and disadvantages regarding generality of the statement one can make, and for each one different statistical considerations apply.<p>Second, the statistical power does not rely on a high population alone, as that (more or less) only affects the significance tests. Much more important is the effect size. If you can measure a large effect (as this study did), it&#x27;s pretty hard not to reach significance anyway.<p>Third, from a statistical point of view, the population isn&#x27;t 5, but much higher.<p>Let me explain:
There are certain kinds of treatments whose effect is reversable. Caffeine intake is an good example: Once you stop taking caffeine, the effect recedes. While designing the study, you can use that property. One common way is an ABAB design, where A is a phase with treatment and B is a phase without. You can chain as much AB pairs as time permits, and additionally you can measure multiple times per phase. Statistically, the population now is real_humans x number_of_phases x measure_points_per_phase.",1442600571

However, because there would undoubtedly be time-consuming litigation about this aspect of the compact, National Popular Vote is working to introduce a bill in Congress for congressional consent.<p>The U.S. Constitution provides:
&quot;No state shall, without the consent of Congress,… enter into any agreement or compact with another state….&quot;<p>Although this language may seem straight forward, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled, in 1893 and again in 1978, that the Compacts Clause can &quot;not be read literally.&quot; In deciding the 1978 case of U.S. Steel Corporation v. Multistate Tax Commission, the Court wrote:
&quot;Read literally, the Compact Clause would require the States to obtain congressional approval before entering into any agreement among themselves, irrespective of form, subject, duration, or interest to the United States.<p>&quot;The difficulties with such an interpretation were identified by Mr. Justice Field in his opinion for the Court in [the 1893 case] Virginia v. Tennessee. His conclusion [was] that the Clause could not be read literally [and this 1893 conclusion has been] approved in subsequent dicta.&quot;<p>Specifically, the Court&#x27;s 1893 ruling in Virginia v. Tennessee stated:
&quot;Looking at the clause in which the terms &#x27;compact&#x27; or &#x27;agreement&#x27; appear, it is evident that the prohibition is directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the states, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.&quot;<p>The state power involved in the National Popular Vote compact is specified in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 the U.S. Constitution:
&quot;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors….&quot;<p>In the 1892 case of McPherson v. Blacker (146 U.S. 1), the Court wrote:
&quot;The appointment and mode of appointment of electors belong exclusively to the states under the constitution of the United States&quot;<p>The National Popular Vote compact would not &quot;encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States&quot; because there is simply no federal power -- much less federal supremacy -- in the area of awarding of electoral votes in the first place.",1442600132

10240986,comment,10240001,10240001,0,0,oppositelock,,,"The NYT is being disingenuous in presenting this as VW detecting the EPA test cycle and doing something to cheat. I think they&#x27;ve confused open loop and closed loop engine operation.<p>VW&#x27;s 4-cylinder engines which failed the EPA tests are all turbo engines. Turbo engines run hotter than naturally aspirated engines and so, they produce more NOx, since it&#x27;s one of the high temperature byproducts. In fact, EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) systems inject exhaust into the intake to lower combustion temperatures and NOx output. All engines do this, turbo or not.<p>Whatever NOx makes it out of the engine can be catalyzed in the catalytic converter if there is enough O2 for the catalyst. All the engine&#x27;s intake air and temperature sensors, and pre-cat and post-cat O2 sensors exist to balance the gases coming into the catalytic converter to optimize the catalytic reaction.<p>When the engine is using all of these sensors to fine tune the amount of air, fuel and EGR to maximize catalyst efficiency, it&#x27;s running in something called &quot;closed loop&quot; mode. The sensors and inputs work in a closed loop to balance the system. This is what happens when you&#x27;re cruising on the highway or driving around at relatively fixed throttle.<p>Give the car a lot of gas, and something else happens. All of a sudden, a LOT more air enters the engine. The sensors can&#x27;t change reading fast enough (mass air flow sensor, for example) or their readings are now out of the sensor&#x27;s useful sensitivity band (for O2). The engine code knows that sensor capabilities have been exceeded, and it goes into &quot;open loop&quot; mode. In this mode, rather than using sensor readings, the engine reverts to pre-programmed maps, usually indexed by RPM, throttle position, engine load, and boost level. These maps are designed for relatively clean combustion and engine safety, but they will not generate optimal catalyst input gases, and so, the catalyst efficiency drops off tremendously. Furthermore, performance cars will often burn rich (too much gas for amount of air) in order to prevent engine destroying pre-detonation.<p>Most of the EPA test cycle will happen in closed loop mode. Most high throttle acceleration or &quot;fun&quot; driving will happen in open loop mode. There&#x27;s the source of the discrepancy between EPA test cycle and real world driving. VW got caught, but every car does this, as we don&#x27;t have wide-band, high-rate sensors yet at a price point even close to where it would need to be for consumer cars.<p>(Next time you see someone racing off from a stop light, in pretty much any car, watch the exhaust pipe, you&#x27;ll see dark smoke. I guarantee you they&#x27;re running rich in open loop mode).",1442599864

Makes sense in a way...you&#x27;d rather have the car expelling the crap on the freeway than city center. That mechanism is apparently a big problem here - I live in a place where the cars never reach freeway speed so they keep clogging (so I&#x27;m told).",1442599326

Attrition rates at elite law schools are vanishingly low (like, less than a half of a percent, whereas PhDs are as high as 50%, 100 times higher).  Undergraduate majors prior to law school tend to be the easier ones.<p>They&#x27;re smart and hard working students, but no, I wouldn&#x27;t consider a law degree to be a &quot;doctoral&quot; level accomplishment by any external standard.  Personally, I think that simply majoring in CS or other rigorous undergraduate majors represents a greater academic accomplishment than Poly Sci or Lit + Law School.<p>Think of it this way - to me, a law degree is like running for 70 minutes at an 8 minute mile pace.  Not bad, you&#x27;re certainly fit.  Majoring in CS at a tough program is like running a 6 minute mile for 40 minutes.  You aren&#x27;t running as long, or even as far, but the athletic challenge is greater.",1442599285

But don't blame CSS for this.<p>I'm happy to come from the POV of pragmatism. I don't see myself as a CSS fanatic. But honestly, I have been using CSS so long that I actually find it harder to work with tables for layout (as I have recently found when I had to work on a legacy site that uses tables for layout). The markup is so much more verbose than what I am used to now (nested tables are evil, full stop). CSS layouts are clear and uncluttered to me in comparison.<p>My own experience tells me that if you put the time in, CSS will make more sense than tables for layout and will become easier, regardless of the crappy support from some browser vendors. Whether one wishes to put the time in or not, is up to them.",1233698077

The true cost of copying and transporting information is phenomenal, I mean I want to copy a VHS it used to cost me $400 max if I bought everything new! If I do similar for a DVD it's running me at least past $1000.<p>However that's the actual cost, the relative cost is in fact near zero. We all have computers/laptops now because we <i>need</i> them, which means the extra cost to rip a DVD now is all of about $2.99 for the rental fee from Blockbuster with an additional like $0.50 to burn copies for people.<p>It's also the value of the object you're ripping. It'd still be considered cost-effective if you bought a $1000 computer to use <i>once</i> to rip the full Adobe suite rather than actually buy the Adobe suite!<p>The FT shouldn't be suing a single user, it's absurd and will cost them money.

Usually people tolerate mean behaviour because there is an asymmetry of power in a relationship. When you need someone more than they need you, they can make harsh demands and treat you like dirt and you will still cooperate.  If people refused to cooperate with assholes, or imposed a cost on assholish  behaviour then it would stop or be reduced.  The fact there are so many giant assholes walking around suggests that being an asshole works, at least sometimes.<p>I don't think there's anything magical about these instincts.

None of these names stick with me, and none strike me as easy to remember, and moreover, none give me an idea of what your company does.<p>I used to get paid to think up these names.

You can also look for words that describe your value proposition, and why you are better than your competitors.<p>Then, go over the list and see if you like any of the combinations. Also, just start free associating with words on the list and words off the list.<p>Another thing you can do is come up with imagery that you think might be good for an ad campaign or in the design of your site.

It's over. The pro-CSS side, at least in the way it is being argued (as if the IE subset <i>is</i> CSS, rather than the standard), is just wrong and totally out of date. They've been abandoned by CSS itself. Quite a long time ago, actually.<p>As for their assertions that this is for ""tabular relationships between data"" in the standard, who cares? Table support is implemented as certain boxes with certain behaviors. If you need those behaviors in your layout, use them. They are well defined. And since content and presentation are so darned separate, it's not like it actually hurts anything, right?<p>(That's a critical point. If you move all the table stuff into CSS, that's <i>fundamentally different</i> than using the standard table tag.

The behavior simply exists, regardless of what it was ""designed"" for, and if you need it, use it. Besides, just <i>read</i> about the table support... if you can't see how that stuff might be useful in a layout, I can't imagine how your mind works.<p>The CSS table support is actually pretty rich, better than the conventional table tag by a lot, or at least, more flexible.",1233694923

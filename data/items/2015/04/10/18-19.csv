I once heard (entirely anecdotal - I&#x27;d love it if someone more knowledgeable on the subject could comment) they had calculated the probability that the LHC would create a black hole that consumed the Earth. The result was more likely than SHA1-hash collision, and was deemed safe enough to try. Somewhere between humorous and scary.<p>edit: did some Googling and found some documentation (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_high-energy_particle_collision_experiments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_high-energy_particle...</a>). It cites an estimated upper limit of 1 in 50 million and references the book in which that estimate is made.",1428692393

I am already a native bilingual English/Arabic speaker, and thought Arabic was a very heavily-structured language, but learning French has made me realize that more than anything it is English that isn&#x27;t. Discovering the French Anglo-Norman influence on the language I speak most often has been a very introspective and eye-opening experience for me.",1428692382
9356418,comment,9355978,9356086,0,0,harrumph,,,"I think RMS is correct here.<p>Corporate membership in an organization whose purpose is to impose market and private mechanisms on whole populations by writing these into state and local law (this is precisely what ALEC does) should be interpreted as an irrevocable announcement that the management of the corporation does in fact endorse imposing its interests on whole populations using state and local law.<p>Amazon left ALEC but did not also replace its leadership at the same time, so its leaving can&#x27;t be construed as a change of perspective on the imposition of legislation as a business strategy.

You can&#x27;t throw a uniform random dart at the entire real line.  I think what you&#x27;re describing gives undue representation to the edges -- you wouldn&#x27;t use those sampling points with those weightings to integrate a function, but you might use the trapezoid method.<p>> The hypothetical uniform dart is as likely to land between 1 and 2 as it is to land between 2 and 3, but there are more representable numbers in the first range than in the second.<p>That&#x27;s a fact of life.",1428692378

You can separate the language into two parts - specifying safety, and specifying liveness. Safety is the easy one, and with knowledge of basic predicate logic and set operations you can have a logic puzzle spec written within hours.<p>Specifying liveness is more difficult, since it involves temporal logic and other things I didn&#x27;t cover in my degree. However, Lamport says (and I&#x27;ve found) 95% of specs will only need boilerplate temporal logic, so don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>I taught myself through the book <i>Specifying Systems</i>, although Lamport now recommends the TLA+ Hyperbook.<p>Teaching yourself TLA+ then applying it to a work project to demonstrate its value to management is a good strategy.

9356407,comment,9355756,9355756,0,0,gt565k,,,"Let me weigh in here. I&#x27;ve worked with Rails, ported a php application to Django, currently working with Spring MVC and Angular JS.<p>PHP is a scripting language, Django is a framework. I think you are comparing 2 different things.<p>If you want to get into web development, there are 2 major concepts/skills you need to get down. First, understanding of MVC, or &quot;MTV&quot;[0], as in Django&#x27;s case, or whatever other variation of said design pattern (MVP, MVVC, etc..). Second, writing and consuming REST APIs. The frameworks will handle or at least guide you through the rest. CSS, HTML, and JS will help you with the front end, but I think as someone who works in ops, you&#x27;d be more comfortable establishing a solid back-end first. You can always bootstrap the front-end.<p>Personally, I try to stay away from anything PHP based. I don&#x27;t think anyone in their right mind would start a new project with a PHP stack. Frameworks like Django, Rails, and other JS frameworks are much more mature, in terms of utility, than anything you&#x27;ll find in PHP.<p>Since you already have experience with it, it would be fairly easy to work with Django after running through a few tutorials.<p>IMO if you go the PHP route, you&#x27;ll get stuck with old technologies, as in your job prospects would involve maintaining legacy php apps. I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone starting a new project with PHP.<p>A developer should be concerned with building applications to meet requirements, writing and consuming REST APIs, and implementing features and utility functions around those.<p>Once you become fairly experienced with one web framework, whether it&#x27;s Django or Rails, explore another framework. Don&#x27;t get stuck with a single technology stack. That&#x27;s the mistake most developers make. They never get out of their comfort zone. Become a polyglot.<p>Fact of the matter is, some frameworks have better integration with certain tools, because of community support. Learn one framework, then learn another, and keep going.<p>Personally, Django is one of my favorites, but I also love Rails. Both do certain things better than the other. There&#x27;s no perfect framework.<p>Check this book out, it&#x27;s free if you read it online.

Luckily my partner has experience, which accelerated my learning a lot.<p>The 2 biggest challenges I found were not related to Unity, but to going from web development (my day job) to game development.<p>1. Programming in 3D: Not much I can say about this since I still struggle with it, except that once I understood vector maths a little more it got much much easier. Even just this silly site helped a lot: <a href=""https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html</a><p>2. Programming in a game loop: The main thing I&#x27;ve learned about this is to always keep things &quot;event driven&quot; as in, whenever possible trying to avoid checking for something happening in the game loop, and trying to instead have some kind of listener for a change that triggers what you need it to. Also, building state machines is something we&#x27;re doing now and that has made logic inside the game loop WAY easier.<p>One other nice thing about Unity was that it reminded me about all the great things about object oriented programming.<p>Some bad things about Unity:<p>1. Not super easy to find answers to stuff online. Stack overflow just isn&#x27;t quite as full in this area.<p>2. Unity Asset store: I think part of the reason for the first problem is that people are trying to sell their solutions, which ends up limiting free or open source growth.<p>On cross platform stuff: It worked like a charm, with a couple hiccups: Leaderboard integration and facebook sharing, but since those are platform specific in some ways anyway, that&#x27;s to be expected - more about configuration really.<p>--<p>Anyway, thanks for the comment. We&#x27;re polishing a bit more now, hopefully an update in the coming months. Yes, it&#x27;s very hard. That&#x27;s been difficult to get right... but our next game will be much easier!",1428692206

I don&#x27;t see there being many changes to that group in the near future, in terms of its counter to Russia (which is of course the primary reason for NATO&#x27;s existence). They drive NATO, and will continue to stick together in various terms for all the overwhelmingly obvious self-interest reasons. Russia is no challenge to NATO, they&#x27;re weaker than they&#x27;ve been in terms of being a real threat since maybe before WW2; in terms of scale and capabilities, they&#x27;re being left behind. Most of the easy gains have already been had by Putin when it comes to re-boosting oil production, ie the party is over, which is why he is shifting to external aggression; the US economy is now nine times the size of Russia&#x27;s, and that gap will only continue to expand - there&#x27;s only so much military threat a country can pose when it has an economy that is going to eventually be ~8% your size.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the expectations were on PAX Americana, but the US is in a stronger position today than it has been in nearly 20 years. The dollar and its share of reserves around the globe are higher than they have been in a long time, with the Euro losing vast amounts of purchasing power rapidly, and losing a lot of share of reserves as people seek to dump it (and QE will push its value much lower yet). The Yen is a disaster, as Japan is aggressively debasing it to prevent bankruptcy. The Yuan is a distant second tier currency that still doesn&#x27;t matter, and won&#x27;t for a long time yet. Today the dollar reserve reigns supreme in a way few expected it to after the financial crisis.<p>When it comes to China challenging the US - and they are the sole challenger - it&#x27;s no worse than the USSR from 1950-1980. The US holds vast sway over nearly the entire planet, both financially and militarily; outside of Russia and China it is able to operate almost anywhere and at any time. Able to twist any country&#x27;s arm financially, including the Swiss. The global surveillance system the US built, is going almost entirely unchallenged (and I&#x27;m not saying I support that fact); nothing is being rolled back or stopped, rather it is advancing. And when it comes to Europe, the US has gained about $3 trillion on the European economy since 2008, as Europe has seen net zero growth during that time; that&#x27;s a vast amount of GDP pick-up, and that spread is likely to get worse in the next decade. Pax Americana is stronger today than it has been in decades, the sole set-back I can think of is the AIIB and that shouldn&#x27;t be a set-back, the US should have joined it as a founding member to its own benefit.",1428691810

Session types, as invented by K. Honda and refined by numerous others, guarantee deadlock and race freedom <i>only within any given session</i>. Session initiation (basically messages to replicated inputs) can deadlock and race in many (most?) session typing systems. The decision <i>not</i> to guarantee the absence of deadlock at session initiation points is what makes session types so simple.<p>It is possible to restrict session types so that they are completely deadlock-free and race-free, but -- as far as we know -- that guarantee comes at the heavy price of making the typing system completely inexpressive, so you cannot  type many natural forms of concurrent programming. Alternatively you can  give up on simplicity and make  the typing system very complicated (e.g. the system pioneered in &quot;Strong Normalisation in the Pi-Calculus&quot; by Honda et al, and its successors). The former is a real problem, as witnessed by the continuing inability of the session typing crowd to get a handle on message passing in Erlang.<p>Finding a system that is expressive, simple and guarantees deadlock-freedom is a major open research problem (and I suspect infeasible).",1428691514

Since so much of Rust is defined in libraries, precisely what is allowed in those unsafe blocks is a fairly important detail; they can violate semantic guarantees that &quot;pure&quot; safe Rust provides.  In this case, the Rust core team made the deliberate choice (which they have discussed on occasion) not to consider deadlocks unsafe behavior, because they were not able to get it to work to their satisfaction.  As another example, there are fairly subtle implications for concurrency around the fact that Rust provides (using unsafe code) a swap function for mutable references.  Swap cannot be written in the pure safe sublanguage.  Yet another example: in pure, safe Rust, memory leaks are not possible (except via premature abort).  This is not true of Rc, hence Rust does not guarantee freedom from memory leaks.",1428691360

Go has very different design goals than Rust, so very little that Rust does would actually be possible in Go, and vice versa.<p>> Go code often passes references over channels, which results in shared memory between two threads with no locking<p>Having a complex type system would cut into compile times (an explicit primary design goal, to the point where the Go compiler must be written to read each file exactly once[0], no more).<p>As for the code you&#x27;re referring to, Go is not designed to be a language which prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot with provable code. It&#x27;s designed to be a language which makes it reasonably easy to be sure you haven&#x27;t, as long as you follow the general idioms and best practices. What you&#x27;re describing here is definitely not one - I can think of a few instances in which pointers might be reasonably passed over a channel, but they&#x27;re few and far between.<p>Also, I would think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that once you&#x27;ve sent something over a channel you shouldn&#x27;t try and write to it anymore[1]. Do you have an example of the code you&#x27;re referring to?<p>[0] well, technically &quot;at most once&quot;, since some files can be skipped entirely.<p>[1] I&#x27;d need to think about this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be difficult to detect this statically[2] at compile-time and enforce that stack-allocated rvalues into channels are never used again in the same scope. It&#x27;s definitely possible to extend `go vet` to handle this, and it may even be possible to write this in as a compiler error in a future version of Go.<p>[2] Incidentally, one of the reasons that it&#x27;s so easy to do reliable static analysis on Go code (compared to other languages) is that the grammar is incredibly simple - it&#x27;s almost entirely context-free, which is very rare among non-Lisps. Having a more complex type system usually requires at least some additional syntax to along with this, which means you&#x27;d have to start sacrificing this design goal as well in order to create a more elaborate type system.",1428690844

You still have to have somebody supervising, but you can just have one person watching 6-8 lanes.<p>At my local Walmart, the self-checkout is far more convenient than the regular lanes. They have more self-checkout lanes open than regular lanes, and people tend to scan their stuff and get out much faster than the cashiers would (seriously, the regular lanes move so slow...). I never use the regular lanes anymore, because they&#x27;re always so busy compared to the self-checkouts.<p>I think the main thing holding Walmart back from further mechanization is that their aisles still have to be human-traversable. Amazon can use really efficient layouts when converting their warehouses to 100% machine-stocked because then there will be no reason for a human to ever walk down the aisles. At Walmart, customers still have to make their way through the aisles, and they have to be laid out to a) allow humans to walk through and take stuff off the shelves and b) arrange items in order to maximize purchases (e.g. put the milk in the back, impulse items at the checkouts, etc.).",1428690836

It <i>might</i> tell you what kind of food that neighborhood prefers. It <i>might</i> tell you which restaurant is more affordable. It <i>might</i> tell you which restaurant has a better public image. Or maybe it just tells you which restaurant is renting out its parking lot to a nearby car repair shop. To wit, quality cannot be determined by observing human behavior. Quality is determined exclusively by predefined parameters. Loudness, brightness, velocity, purity, etc., are measures of quality. In other words, quality is antipodal to popularity. Every human relation to an object, such as cost, availability, relevance, etc., has priority over quality at all times. It is even more accurate to say that quality is never a direct factor in choice. A person does not choose a knife, for example, because it is sharper than other knives; a person chooses the knife because it is <i>sharp enough</i> to meet their needs and, more importantly, because it is accessible to them. The only exception is the case where a person seeks out the highest quality option for the sake of quality itself, i.e. &quot;I want to find the sharpest knife in the world.&quot; In this exceptional scenario, however, one learns nothing by studying the quality-seeking crowd that could not have been learned by simply measuring and comparing objects, i.e. it is much easier to find the sharpest knife by measuring knives for sharpness than by trying to determine which humans buy knives strictly because they are sharper than the alternatives (in such a case you would still have to measure the knives to confirm any conclusions you came to). All of this being said, I can&#x27;t believe people at MIT studying human behavior would make such an absurd analogy. It indicates a complete misunderstanding of not only human beings but of logic as well.",1428690724

My major hurdle was that this was spent on my own time as my employers weren&#x27;t interested in applying formal specification tools to our work (real-time, embedded, safety critical systems, it seemed a natural fit to me, especially because the programs were actually fairly small in the scheme of things). My current employers are similarly averse to spending time on formal specifications, but we&#x27;re doing embedded, real-time, wireless communication systems and again, it&#x27;s a fairly natural fit (though what we develop is much larger so full post hoc analysis with this tool would be impractical, if not impossible).<p>How difficult, in your opinion, would it be for someone with a math and CS degree (as educational background) to spin up on TLA+ in their spare time?

I can think of several small projects that would be useful or will be started in a few weeks/months that I might be able to use as demonstrations of the utility of a system like TLA+ (requiring only an analysis of small portions of the protocol, for instance).",1428689904

I believe the density of rouge planets is supposed to be of order the average density of normal planets in the galaxy (i.e., there might be 3 times as many rouge planets, but not 100 times as many).  So finding a relativistic rouge planet nearby enough to be useful has negligible probability.  (They are created by close encounters with black holes, after all.)<p>> Catching up to them would be hard, though.<p>Well, if you&#x27;re thinking about using them as &quot;space ships&quot;, you need to get up to speed anyways (since the alternative is to just travel on your own).",1428689328

It may seem easy &quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE id = &#x27;123&#x27;;&quot; but you also need to delete all of their related records. Let&#x27;s say you have a user table with use username, hashed password, and id in it and then all that address/DOB/etc in a users_data table or similar. Now you need to delete the users_data record as well. But that&#x27;s not all, what about all the transactions in the &quot;rides&quot; table. They are related to the user but we need to keep them for historical data and/or reports. It can get messy VERY quickly and if the application is changing quickly then your &quot;delete user&quot; logic might leave behind new user data that it doesn&#x27;t account for.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that while I do find it mildly annoying that there is no &quot;Delete Account&quot; button there are good reasons for it. Not is this a non-insignificant amount of work to build/maintain but from a business point of view it means spending time/money on a feature that is only for people who no longer want to be your customer so put in that light it&#x27;s no surprise this feature falls by the wayside often. Also there is the whole &quot;I accidentally deleted my account&quot; (no matter how many warning you put up) and that means you either need to &quot;soft delete&quot; all the data so you can &quot;undo&quot; OR you have to reconstruct the user&#x27;s data from a backup (either programmatically or by hand).",1428689294

I have been experimenting with a Future & Stream [1] abstraction in Rust that would allow easily describing complex concurrent and async operations and to allow easy composition, not unlike ES 6 promises.<p>The interesting thing is that, thanks to Rust&#x27;s ownership system, it is easy to discover when handles to a future value go out of scope. This allows the library to reuse internal resources to make the overhead of using the library as light as possible.<p>For example, a Stream is modeled as a sequence of futures (more specifically a future of the next value and a new stream representing the rest of the values, kind of like lazy-seq in clojure but async), but instead of allocating one future for each iteration of the stream, the same internal structure is reused while still being able to expose this API.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/carllerche/eventual"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/carllerche/eventual</a>",1428689251

Always happy to see people working towards a WYSIWYG editor for Markdown.<p>I did a similar project¹, with strong focus on editing math, inline, and “real time” wysiwyg. It failed. The problem is that most such approaches treat Markdown as _code_ instead of _text_, and inevitably mistake syntax highlighting for semantic, text-driven styling (as if one would style nouns, verbs, adjectives, instead of <h1>, <p>, <em>, etc.). Thus they use a code editor such as CodeMirror (like this one does, too). And then you must style `.cm-` syntax markers instead of the eventual (html) nodes that would be the output of a real Markdown parser. Which makes it impossible to just throw in any arbitrary html5 css-stylesheet. Which is imho the whole point of wysiwyg Markdown editing.<p>What you’d really want instead is true Markdown parsing, which normalizes the user’s input into a parse tree, then renders to clean html. But syncing input and output over an AST is quite impossible as long as Shadow DOM is not available in browsers. Cfr interesting discussion, over at Github (re: Quill editor).²<p>As for Markdown parsers: there’s many of them. The OP’s project uses @chjj’s marked.js³: wouldn’t harm to mention that on the homepage or in the README, since behavior (markdown interpretation) is very different from parser to parser. (I used to maintain a repo which lists all available Markdown parsers, apps, etc.)⁴<p>Meanwhile there’s CommonMark⁵, of course, which has already some really fast implementations in JavaScript. (Plus, they’re “Standard” ;-)⁶ Would be nice to see one of the CommonMark reference implementations incorporated into a WYSIWYG editor like this one.<p>¹ <a href=""https://github.com/rhythmus/mathdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rhythmus/mathdown</a>\n² <a href=""https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/74#issuecomment-42942223"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/74#issuecomment-4294...</a>\n³ <a href=""https://github.com/chjj/marked"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chjj/marked</a>\n⁴ <a href=""https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources</a>\n⁵ <a href=""http://commonmark.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commonmark.org</a>\n⁶ <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8264733"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8264733</a>",1428688872

9356009,comment,9352925,9353284,0,0,tracker1,,,"I mostly agree regarding Intel... A lot of this is all pretty shady, I will make one exception to your comment about MS eating IE&#x27;s costs.<p>When MS started including IE with windows, every other graphical OS included a browser (OS/2 Warp, and early Linux distros).  I think the irritation was how deeply they embedded the browser, which does make some sense as it allowed them to create the CHM help files, which is a pretty nice format.  As well as some of the push desktop stuff early one, which I kind of liked.  The down side is that support for newer browsers on older OS versions was effectively made into a cliff for IE.<p>I&#x27;m glad that Chrome and Firefox carry as much weight as they do.  Seeing a roughly 1:1:1 split among the top three is best for the larger community.  The down side being how long it takes for an IE version to ship (still), which means that IE while ahead at launch quickly falls behind and becomes our least common denominator for public websites for years.<p>In particular, while I don&#x27;t mind using JS transpilers like Babel/6to5 to get new features today, the fact that I can&#x27;t use these without such tools for the next 4-5 years is kind of sad.  As an aside, I really wish there was a common background worker abstraction that worked in both node and the browser... I know I can fork/cluster in node and use webworkers where available, it would still be nice to see a common interface for this stuff.",1428688839

I haven&#x27;t looked deeply into other sources, and used the phone as a normal user (I&#x27;ve borrowed it to a friend of ours, when they went to Italy for vacation (we are US based)), and then I used them again when travelling to Bulgaria.<p>Why FirefoxOS phones there? Because they don&#x27;t draw much attention, they are cheap, and reliable for basic phone needs - calling, texting, even some browsing. Also the battery life is pretty good.<p>They are bit sluggish, but still much faster than other cheap phones.",1428688809

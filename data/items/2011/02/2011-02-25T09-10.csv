It's more that, if what you want to write (given the state of the world at the time) was some software to help people organise their lives, then you have to hit it from a social angle.<p>People don't want to use Excel and Sharepoint and Outlook, we only do it because we have to. No one would use a piece of non-work software if the use case was 'Create a schedule of events you plan to attend.'<p>but make the use cases: ""Track what your friends are doing."" ""Meet new people."" ""Let people know what you're up to.""<p>You are aiming for the things that people might want from the software.",1298627958

It's not third party to your OS it comes with you OS, your OS is installed with it, you OS is upgraded with the package  manager. You only need to use the package manager that comes with your OS (i have never had to use yum while on a debian os). None is true on OSX.<p>The OSX package managers are not as good as apt (the one package manager I have a lot of experience), in the same way Nextstep is not as good as OSX.

In Fireworks or Photoshop? And looked at it a few days? If not you should. It's tempting and often faster to hack and test layouts in Jade and Stylus (or HAML and SASS) but I made the experience that if doing a mockup in Fireworks and just watch and get used to it a few days you get a much better feeling of your product. After a few days you realize bad design choices, start to change and your design and UI slowly matures into something perfect. Usually this takes up to 7 to 14 days.<p>Current flaws:<p>- Headers much too small in relation to thumb size and overall layout<p>- I question the thumbs: do they really offer any benefit?

This is doubly so for any library which uses method_missing? or other bits of Ruby-dynamism. Yes, it can (and does) lead to terser, elegant code. But it also makes it challenging to analyze root causes, and I have become less enamored of this style as I have had to deal with it over the past few years.<p>In this respect method_missing? is analogous to (over)using C's preprocessors. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but...",1338700081

Just because it happened doesn't mean it is worth telling. Just because it happened doesn't mean that it will sell. Just because it happened doesn't mean that it is art.<p>Benjamin Franklin probably didn't do anything with a key and a kite and a thunderstorm. Did you know? Do you care? It makes a good story so we tell it. We build the mythology of our heroes (and villains) through the best narratives that we can construct, not necessarily the most true. Aaron Sorkin is not a truth-teller; he is a storyteller. His entire purpose is to entertain and he has a knack for doing just that.[0] Hopefully he manages to do so with this film, because there are parts of Steve Jobs' life that would do incredibly well with the Sorkin treatment. Personally, I can't wait. The author of this piece is not so excited. I have some advice for him: don't watch it, particularly since you don't seem to know the difference between biography and story.<p>[0]: See: <i>The West Wing, Social Network, A Few Good Men, Moneyball</i>.",1338699889

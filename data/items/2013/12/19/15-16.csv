For example, the thief of Sheep marketplace instead of tumbling his coins endlessly through the blockchain (and being watched doing so) could&#x27;ve just waited for an anonymous exchange to open that he could&#x27;ve deposited into and and bought new altcoins (maybe he could even setup the exchange.) On the other hand, people that had their coins stolen could&#x27;ve owned such an exchange and tracked the thief&#x27;s altcoins out of the exchange.<p>But every altcoin has a set of pro and cons. They&#x27;re just like flavours of Linux, and how hard is it to switch over as a miner, user or admin? The real power of altcoins how I see it will come when a second generation of altcoins comes into existence. Perhaps some way of retracting stolen or lost coins would be an interesting feature, perhaps tying coins to an email address for approval of spending or a resending of lost keys.",1387468728

I do still feel like the MBA would be more suitable(able to do more stuff on a larger screen on the go is really convenient), however I can&#x27;t ignore my desire to game(which I do regularly). Using an Apple Wireless keyboard with a tablet would look really silly, plus I had such a keyboard with my prior iPad(gave it to my mum, so there&#x27;s that).<p>Also, my room is hot as hell all year round, sweat runs down my back all day long.<p>I recall doing most of the paper writing and circuit simulations either in my room or somewhere in the house(before my HDD died).

There is a growing body of study that says it&#x27;s not an inability to empathize with others, but more likely a hypersensitivity to stimulus. Regardless of whether or not that is true, with such a drastic difference in opinion on the nature of the disease, it seems unlikely that studies on the occurrence of the disease would yield meaningful results.<p>I have a few problems with the study you linked to. It looks like they are basing the data off of interviews of parents who brought their kids in for testing, comparing the diagnosis rates for these kids. Wouldn&#x27;t this more likely show that &quot;boys with disruptive behavioral issues are 12 times more likely to have it blamed on autism than girls of the same age&quot;, not that &quot;boys are more likely to be autistic&quot;? They collected data over an 8 year span for a 20 year span of birth-years, but never indicate the age of the subject <i>at the time of diagnosis</i>. Given that the test is almost completely behavioral in nature, wouldn&#x27;t it stand to reason that age is a significant factor in behavioral development, and thus the likelihood of being diagnosed with behavioral issues?<p>I remember the other study you mentioned, it was in the early 2000s. I remember because one of my professors conducted our university&#x27;s part of the study and made his students fill out the questionnaire during class. They asked questions on the narcissistic personality disorder spectrum on the hypothesis that lack of empathy correlated to Aspberger&#x27;s syndrome. From there, finding a statistically significant skewing of the data supporting the idea that computer science students lack empathy, they then concluded that Aspberger&#x27;s-afflicted people are attracted to the pure, analytical nature of programming.<p>Talk about leaping lizards of logic, Batman.<p>Without an associated correlation of lack of empathy in other analytical fields, I just think the far more likely answer is that, as a culture, we tolerate dickish behavior out of programmers more than any other analytical field, and thus people either learn dickishness or people who are prone to dickishness find a certain degree of survivability in programming. My experiences online with communities such as YouTube and 4chan indicate that dickishness is extremely easily learned behavior.",1387468630

WebRTC is all great and shiny but there is strong obstacles to build correct data transfer applications on top of that:<p>- You still need a server to do the &quot;signaling&quot; part<p>- NAT are everywhere and will fail your p2p connections sometimes (14% of WebRTC calls according to Google, back in may) [1]<p>- Ultimately there is a problem with JavaScript API that does not allow you to download big files seamlessly<p>The signaling part can be solved in many ways but the server approach is the easiest and probably the most efficient/reliable one. For more informations I recommend checking an article on the infrastructure needed for WebRTC applications [2]<p>The NAT problem is solved by ICE via STUN and TURN [3]. TURN is the ultimate fallback, it is a media relay.\nTURN servers are bandwidth expensive and most of them require credentials in a way that does not fit WebRTC properly.<p>Finally, there is the browsers problem. None of them provide a proper and standard way to give you the ability to download a stream of data coming from JavaScript (although after checking the issue, sharefest may have solved this problem, but I don&#x27;t know if it works properly with firefox). There the File API in Chrome but it is not supported in Firefox. There is the blob URI but you need the whole file to create this object. This mean that your application will slow down your browser in the case of a big file sharing [4].\nIdeally I wanted to see the stream API be implemented but it seems it&#x27;s not going to happen, so we need something else [5].<p>In conclusion, no, it&#x27;s not as easy as you think it is. To have a proper file sharing application you will need to address ALL of these problems.\nMoreover, it&#x27;s good to note that these problem are not specific to WebRTC applications. Indeed, most of these are problems we have with the Internet in general.

In such cases only certain employees can actually withdraw underlying coins for special reasons, otherwise the underlying blockchain is hidden to staff who just see balances in their logins and transfer between other staff for day-to-day tasks.) Same with a government, who may fund projects and accept taxes in their own coin. The tyranny or tax to watch out for on top of all this is if some group comes in and says &quot;I demand x% of all coins from your new blockchain.&quot;<p>On a similar note, Litecoins are big in China. If the blockchain were to come under attack, a large group of Chinese people would be pissed off enough to come together to do something about it.

For instance the utter and complete incompetence of the BBC team who seem to have so much trouble delivering a simple video streaming application (which they bizarrely built around embedded flash.

Only reality doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>Google Play spending still lags iOS, largely as a mechanic of the lack of some of the top tier apps, limited access to the pay market in the Play Store in some countries, and the slowness of Play Store gift cards to pick up, but that gap is closing at a stunning pace (iOS app spending is up 20% YoY, while Android spending is up 235%).",1387467242

They are <i>threatening</i> the industry with extensive regulation if the biggest ISPs does not put in place filters. It&#x27;s their way of evading democratic oversight. It is worse than government enforced blocks.<p>As for the hint of blocking &quot;extremist&quot; views, this worries me tremendously, as someone who in the past was a member of a marxist organisation (in Norway, not the UK) that for decades was under illegal surveillance (of the type where intelligence officials would stop prominent members in the street on occasion to openly taunt them with stories about the conversation said person had with his wife in the privacy of his own home the previous day) despite no evidence <i>ever</i> of any illegal activity (meanwhile members of the then ruling-party in Norway have been convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union...). Another organization under illegal surveillance was, subsequent to the illegal surveillance being rolled up, denounced as a terrorist organisation by an ex prime minister, in parliament, fro the speakers chair, with no evidence of any illegal activity provided (on the contrary, <i>they</i> stand as one of just a handful of victims of terrorist bomb plots in Norway - a bomb plot the intelligence services eventually had to admit they had used as an opportunity to steal internal documents), as he publicly made it clear that he wished that the illegal surveillance had not been stopped.<p>In the UK, &quot;extremist&quot; views would likely have including support for the provisional IRA if it had been put in place a decade or two ago, but the question is how far out from that would they have stretched it? Would they have tried to block people who argued for secession but who did not explicitly support violent means? People who supported self-defence in the case of attacks from security forces but not terror? Note that many of the restrictions aimed to target the IRA were not so obviously restricting only people implicated in terror.<p>While it is obvious to us that extremist fundamentalist islamism is dangerous since there are groups actively planning terror attacks, it is very often very hard to draw clear lines between people engaged in clearly harmful violent activity and people engaged in unpopular political activity that may very well turn out to be important down the line (back to my own example, a long list of the people subjected to illegal surveillance in Norway have become highly important and influential cultural figures)<p>For my own part not more than 20 years ago since I debated people from mainstream parties - in fact including from the current coalition parties in Norway - that though my liberalist marxist views, which I have never backed with violence, was sufficient reason that they believed I deserved to die (meanwhile I also regularly debated Stalinists who wished me the same fate) or rot in prison.

But I thought about changing because apparently over 90% of Python developers on GitHub use Spaces.<p>Problem is, for every benefit there is a downside and some of the benefits aren&#x27;t that interesting to me.<p>Benefits seem to be:<p>1. Alignment without mixing (which is bad in some languages). I don&#x27;t align.<p>2. Code looks the same for everyone. Doesn&#x27;t need some workarounds if you publish code or present it outside the editor to get your prefered width.<p>Downside is:<p>1. I use variable width for some filetypes. People might not agree with that. I wanted to convert all my tabs to 4 spaces when I realized that I&#x27;ve set sass to 2 and \nsometimes change it to 4. Conversion is possible, but tricky especially if you align.<p>2. OCD/Perfection clashes. Tabs kind of make sense for indentation.<p>The problems I have with tabs are:<p>1. Barely anyone seems to use them anymore.<p>2. Some languages I like (like YAML) don&#x27;t allow tabs.<p>3. Needs some non-standard CSS to get them to display as 4 Spaces in the Browser instead of the overly wide 8. I think GitHub converts them automatically to spaces in the preview to avoid that issue (though your still at 8 then).<p>I guess I might end up with spaces in the near future. It&#x27;s kind of a &quot;What I like&quot; vs. &quot;What others use&quot; situation. I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with tabs unless you really have to align your code.",1387466358

It is an act of deception and false statements to convince someone of untruth. Disinformation should not be confused with misinformation, information that is unintentionally false.<p>> Unlike traditional propaganda techniques designed to engage emotional support, disinformation is designed to manipulate the audience at the rational level by either discrediting conflicting information or supporting false conclusions. A common disinformation tactic is to mix some truth and observation with false conclusions and lies, or to reveal part of the truth while presenting it as the whole (a limited hangout).<p>> Another technique of concealing facts, or censorship, is also used if the group can affect such control. When channels of information cannot be completely closed, they can be rendered useless by filling them with disinformation, effectively lowering their signal-to-noise ratio and discrediting the opposition by association with many easily disproved false claims.",1387466302

I have some Apple products, like an iPhone, but I tried using Mac OSX for a year and hated it.  I have a MacBook Pro at work, but I bootcamped it and run Windows 7 solely.  I&#x27;ve been a Microsoft user since MS-DOS 3.3, so I don&#x27;t care what OSX&#x27;s install numbers are.  I started my career programming for Windows 3.1 SDK, using MFC, etc, so I&#x27;ve been with Microsoft every step of the way.<p>Windows 7 was a great OS after a disastrous Windows Vista.  Windows 8 is again an unmitigated disaster.  88M users out of 1 billion install base?<p><a href=\"http://www.neowin.net/news/there-could-be-885-million-windows-8-users-but-is-that-big-enough\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.neowin.net/news/there-could-be-885-million-window...</a><p>Even Steve Ballmer himself said that Windows 8 was not selling enough.<p><a href=\"http://www.neowin.net/news/ballmer-states-that-windows-is-not-selling-well-next-gen-surface-in-testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.neowin.net/news/ballmer-states-that-windows-is-no...</a><p>No one wants to upgrade to Windows 8.  That&#x27;s why they are backing away from their Metro strategy.  Yet another integration attempt that has completely blown up in their face.<p>You are also wrong about Bing&#x27;s search traffic.  It&#x27;s 18%.  As I said, largely ignored.  4 out of 5 people ignore Bing.  Bundling Yahoo as disingenuous since most people don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s Bing.  I worked at Yahoo.  I know how inertia works, and given that their search share hasn&#x27;t changed much since they had their own search engine, it&#x27;s being used by people that just don&#x27;t care.  You could switch Yahoo&#x27;s backend to Google and no one would know the difference, because they don&#x27;t care.<p>Sure, Windows Phone may be a small success in Latin America, if you consider selling dirt cheap phones with no margin a success.  It&#x27;s still the #2 phone to Android and  Windows Phone is still 3-6% marketshare worldwide.  94 people in the world out of 100 ignore Windows Phone.  It&#x27;s absolutely ignored.  That may change in the future, if Microsoft gives away their phones for free.  But as of right now, they are absolutely ignored.<p>Microsoft is unable to create a single experience on any of their platforms that bring happiness to their users, except for X-box.  I don&#x27;t have an X-box one, but many of my coworkers are complaining like hell about Microsoft&#x27;s need to change the X-box one&#x27;s experience to more like Metro&#x27;s.  I can&#x27;t speak to how accurate this statement is.

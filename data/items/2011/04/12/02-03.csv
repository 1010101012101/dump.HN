2435659,comment,2433860,2434849,5,0,dhess,,,"Interesting. The parallels between ML and Scheme, two languages invented in the '70s and in an academic setting, are striking: the core language is great, but the community is divided into ever-so-slightly incompatible implementations, so, in practice, there's very little sharing. Therefore, it's impractical to do most ""large"" projects in the language, due to lack of critical mass of useful libraries. ML/Scheme end up being learning languages, for the most part, and then everyone moves on to {OCaml, Haskell}/Common Lisp to get real work done.<p>I would say these similar outcomes are a repudiation of the idea that multiple implementations of the same language is a good thing, but that hasn't hurt C's popularity. More likely, it has something to do with their roots in programming language research. Maybe ML and Scheme are <i>too</i> good for their own good, and other academics can't resist using them as a basis for their own pet ideas. Perhaps a truly successful (read, ""widely-adopted"") programming language has to be flawed just enough to discourage anyone from trying to improve on it. Worse is better strikes again?",1302577043

It's very possible that the proportion of web traffic coming from IE is significantly lower than the proportion of web users that use IE, and in fact, I'd guess it's fairly likely to be the case since heavy web users are probably more likely to use Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc. than an average web user.<p>Now, I too would be very surprised if that observation brings 45% of web <i>users</i> down to under 10% of web <i>traffic</i>, but I don't doubt that web traffic from IE is lower than 45%.",1302577029

2435649,comment,2435408,2435408,30,0,wtallis,,,"Graphing calculators aren't pointless, but most people using them are missing the point. (And TI likes it that way.)<p>Why not just put Mathematica on a netbook? Aside from the fact that a netbook is 3-5 times larger and thus less portable, it's all about the user interface. What's the smallest laptop you can get that has a real number pad, with its own enter, +, -, x, and / keys? It's probably bigger than any netbook. A graphing calculator should have a keyboard that is designed not around general-purpose text entry, but around entering math. Even the graphing calculators that have QWERTY keyboards also a dedicated number pad and a bunch of other keys.<p>Even though I have a full-size 109-key keyboard and a pair of monitors totaling over 4 megapixels, and I have MATLAB, Mathematica, and a bunch of other math programs installed, I still keep my HP-50g on my desk right under my monitor. It turns on instantly, has a pretty good keyboard layout, and even though the screen resolution is monochrome 131x80, it makes good use of the whole screen to display just what I'm working on. MATLAB <i>et al</i> are basically worthless for short computations even if you do keep them running at all times, and while they are both faster for large computations and have more features, they aren't as interactive and simpler functions are take too many keystrokes to get to when compared with my calculator. (I will occasionally actually use a 50g emulator on my desktop for some of the tasks that are a bit cumbersome without a full QWERTY keyboard, but still suck with native software.)<p>------<p>Of course, the above is only why we <i>should</i> be continuing to use and develop graphing calculators. It has nothing to do with the current markets. (Astute readers will have guessed this based on my use of an HP calculator as an example.)<p>The current reality in the calculator market is that calculators are designed for and marketed to teachers who train their students to be machines that operate calculators. TI and Casio are competing to see who can better enable bad teaching methods. They do this by offering standardized platforms, fully locked-down to assuage teachers' fears about kinds of cheating that shouldn't even help on a properly designed math test, and they partner with textbook authors and publishers to integrate their model's functionality in to the ""curriculum"".<p>Nobody is designing or marketing calculators to engineers anymore, and engineers are for the most part not using handheld calculators as much as they used to. I don't think it's clear which is the cause and which is the effect. What is clear is that you can't judge the entire concept of a handheld graphing calculator based solely on the models that weren't meant to be useful. Almost anything a good calculator can do, it will do better than a general-purpose machine.",1302576848

They often cost more to deliver the same services.<p>Which reminds me, why are you assuming that it's better to spend 2x as much on an ""excellent"" professor?

2435524,comment,2434919,2434919,71,0,geofflewis,,,"At Topguest, we’ve signed many deals with big companies such as Hilton Worldwide, IHG, Virgin America, Wyndham, and others despite being in business under a year and not having prior experience in our industry. First, before you even start trying to get a meeting, these 2 things must both be true:<p>• You have a strong hypothesis of what Company X’s specific pain point is, informed by research<p>• If your hypothesis is right, there is a >50% chance that your product can actually solve their pain point<p>If both of the above are not true, do not proceed. You will waste your time and theirs.<p>If both are true, you’re in luck. The sequence I propose assumes that you are starting from scratch, just like we were. No flashy connections at the target Company, no warm intro, no impressive track record. This sequence will not result in a meeting every time, but in my experience it has had about a 75% success rate:<p>1.\tAll emails to the prospective partner should be sent by someone with a very impressive sounding title, ideally the CEO. This is annoying, since generally titles are cheesy and can be really problematic at startups. But unfortunately titles are  important for business development. If nothing else, the email coming from the CEO could make BigCo Manager Y think “Oh well, even though this will likely be waste of 30 minutes, I will get to meet the CEO of Cool Startup Z which could possibly help me somehow in the future”.<p>2.\tAvoid agencies. Do not try to get to Company X through their advertising agency, social media consultant, hairdresser, or other service provider. Your goal is to get a meeting with a decision maker as fast as possible. Going through an Agency will both put your starting point far away from a decision maker, and at minimum will 2X your timeline.<p>3.\tDevelop an unhealthy addiction to LinkedIn. Utilize the Advanced Search function to find people at Company X that can serve as entry points for your quest. Here are the characteristics you are looking for:<p>i.\tHave one type of common thread with you that you can use as an anchor. Same college, used to work at same company, played same sport in college, were at same conference X years ago, etc. Use Google to augment their LinkedIn profile to help identify a common thread. Note, LinkedIn connections in common does not = common thread. Generally I never use weak LinkedIn connections to get an intro because a. odds are that your in-common connection does not have influence with your prospect, so you’ll just get jerked around, and b. I personally have far more respect for ambitious people that smartly reach out to me directly vs. having intermediaries I don’t know well facilitate introductions.<p>ii.\tAre likely in a “Decision Making” role. Guess what? Very few jobs at big companies are actually “Decision Making” roles! It is hard to tell who can make decisions and who can’t, and even titles can be very misleading. But generally, Vice President of X, or Sr. Director of Y have at least some decision making power.<p>iii.\tWork in the department who would most likely be purchasing (or testing) your product. Use your sleuthing powers to figure out what the right department is. If you have researched your market this should not be that hard.\niv.\tTheir online footprint indicates they are ambitious. Beyond LinkedIn, check Twitter, Quora, blogs, news articles, Facebook, etc. and make a judgment call on whether the person appears to be ambitious or not. Ambitious people become champions of new ideas and introduce them to organizations. Un-ambitious people do not.<p>4.\tObtain the email address of anyone you’ve identified at Company X who meets at least 2 of the 4 criteria above. We will call these people your “prospects.” Do not message prospects over LinkedIn, that’s amateur. If you can’t find the email address of a prospect, find the email address for someone else at the company and insert your prospect’s name into that format. Works every time.<p>5.\tEmail only the best person based on the Criteria from #3 above. Crafting this email is an art, and you must get it just right. There are many great blog posts on how to cold email people, I suggest reading them. For the purposes of this sequence, here is what I suggest:<p>i.\tThe subject line must contain the single most impressive thing about your Company to Random person X. Not the most impressive thing to you or your team who know about all the goodies under the hood, but the must impressive thing to a random person from the street. If you have backing from ‘top tier’ investors or a star advisor that your prospect will have heard of, use in your subject line<p>ii.\tThe first sentence of the email must establish your credibility. E.g. “I am the CEO of Startup Q, recently featured in The Wall Street Journal [link]. We are building X for Y”<p>iii.\tThe next sentences must exploit your common thread, or subtly hint as to how you could help this person get ahead; preferably both. Here is an example: “I am also a graduate of Georgia Tech (Sci ‘08!), and am reaching out to you since our Product is delivering 200% ROI for Vaguely Competitive Company Z.”<p>iv.\tThe next sentences must illustrate that you get what is important to the Company and have an idea of how you could help. Here is an example: “I’m impressed by your efforts to grow Brand Z’s Facebook fan base. I read about Initiative X in AdAge and it seems like you’re at the cutting edge. That’s why I believe a simple tool that lets Company X sell products to Facebook Fans could be useful and interesting for you.<p>v.\tClose the deal with a specific request for an “introductory conversation” and suggest a few dates.<p>6.\tIf this person gets back to you within 5 business days, awesome. Prepare a brief presentation, and try your hardest to have the meeting in person. Real connections between people are developed in person not over the phone. And the hardest part of selling is a developing a real connection with the prospect.<p>7.\tMost likely, your first email attempt will not elicit a response after 5 business days. Do not despair! Rather:\ni.\tMove on to the other prospects you identified from LinkedIn, using the same email format as above. Email each of these people separately, at the same time.\nii.\tForward your initial email back to the initial prospect attaching a new and interesting relevant news article, a statement to the effect of “I know how busy you are”, and a new request to meet with your updated availability<p>8.\tIf you have one person willing to meet with you by now, awesome. Proceed with step 6.<p>9.\tMost likely, you’ll still have no response. So follow up with each of the additional prospects you emailed in Step 7 with a similar follow up note.<p>10.\tIf still no luck about 15 business days from when you started, email your initial “best” prospect and “second best” prospect together in the same email. Say something to the effect of “touched base with each of you and wanted to follow up. Do either of you have availability to connect? We have made progress X, Y, Z since my initial note and I’d love to update you.” Emailing both the people puts a competitive dynamic at play where neither person wants to look like a slacker to the other person, therefore making at least one of them more likely to write you back.<p>This sequence should help you get your initial meeting. But the real work starts after… From initial meeting to “sale” could take months… or years. Unfortunately my post is way too long as is, so will save the rest of my business development advice for another time ☺ Hope this helps a bit!<p>--Geoff",1302574442

No navy subs (at least non-classified subs) do this. Not having ballast tanks is a huge design advantage.<p>Firing missiles from a Sub against a low tech country with no navy to speak of is hardly a combat situation. In naval combat the only thing subs are really afraid of is other subs and aircraft, and the best way to give up your position is to fire a torpedo.",1302573816

I've worked with many properties that ranked top 3 in Yahoo/Bing yet were all but invisible on Google (not banned, just not ranking well), and vice versa.

9555354,comment,9549449,9552574,0,0,bayesianhorse,,,"Yes, I know about &quot;welfare traps&quot;. And I don&#x27;t believe it. The assumptions behind welfare traps is that people who don&#x27;t get a job stop trying to look hard enough for one. To make that a significant factor, companies would have to have large amounts of unfulfilled positions, where in turn a significant amount of eligible workers are unemployed. At best, this happens when the wages for a particular job are so low, that they end up costing society rather than saving them money compared to full welfare payment. State subsidized work, effectively.<p>In Germany, welfare payments are reduced by some amount when poeple refuse to comply. That can be things like refusing an education program or a job offer. These sanctions may not be enough to overcome psychological factors, but it is enough to rule out financial reasons for refusing.",1431762890

The whole country&#x27;s economy is based on people getting into &quot;Profitable&quot; domains mostly following the success of a pioneer in the field. 
The most recent example of this ideology is the &quot;Business Process Outsourcing&quot; industry. 
New BPO units are propping up here and there at a dime a dozen leading to a quality deterioration in the final deliverable. 
This process will continue till a saturation level is reached and then they will wait till another &quot;Killer&quot; domain picks up momentum. 
Till then India will be in a so called &quot;Calm Period&quot; where nothing great and major takes place.

This is an arbitrage opportunity. Buy for 95 at market 2, sell for 100 at market 1. This is a gauranteed profit of 5. Obviously this would drive the price down in market 1 (excess supply) and up in market 2 (excess demand), which would balance these 2 out eventually.<p>Here is an old joke about this:<p>Two economists walk on the road and find a $100 bill in the road. Economist 1 asks whether he should go for it. Economist 2 replies that such an opportunity cannot exist as someone else would have already taken the bill.

9555327,comment,9554784,9555239,0,0,davidovitch,,,"In Belgium, you are allowed to do this. When I moved to Copenhagen I was seriously annoyed for the reasons you mentioned when I realized I had to first cross, wait and only then go on with my ride. However, I started realizing that the Copenhagen way actually works very well, and it is a LOT safer, and so much more relaxed (not slower). Merging into traffic and crossing the street to get to the lane to turn left can be a stressful affair. I used to bike in Brussels and I can assure you that is a jungle over there: you have to be reckless as a biker (and so I was) if you want to get anywhere at all. On the upside: a fast morning ride through Brussels from home to work was one big adrenaline shot. Once behind my desk, I was awake, sharp and ready to start working :-)<p>Additionally, cars going for a left turn usually have a separate traffic light which is red when the main direction has green. The time you gain using that lane compared to the &quot;box turn&quot; is minimal as such.<p>A lot is also context: Copenhagen has a very extensive bicycle lane network that does not involve any cars that is constantly expanding. Cykelslangen is a nice example of such a bike only short cut <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmKXYZZy6dI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmKXYZZy6dI</a>, <a href=""http://www.dw.dk/cykelslangen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dw.dk/cykelslangen/</a>, <a href=""http://classiccopenhagen.blogspot.dk/2014/06/cykelslangen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classiccopenhagen.blogspot.dk/2014/06/cykelslangen.ht...</a>. When going around the city, you are just faster with a bike because you take more direct routes (away from car lanes) with less traffic lights. If I have to take a left turn on big busy car street, I couldn&#x27;t car less if I had to wait for making a box turn: I am faster anyway, and the properly tuned and fast switching red-green lights minimize the wait.",1431761795

No JavaScript there! It was not even a gleam in my eye, although I did write a language processor for editing MPEG-2 streams.<p>So I indeed created JS in a mad rush to get it into Netscape 2, along with other things Netscape tried as part of a platform play against Microsoft.<p>If I had not rushed, I would have missed not only Netscape 2, but also Netscape 3. Netscape 3 was supposed to be version 2.1, a minor release, until a company Netscape had acquired was given the browser and screwed up their release schedule so badly that it slipped into 1997 and became Netscape 4.<p>In 1998 or even 1997 it would have been too late to ship JS and have it make a de-facto standard. MS had already shipped VBScript as a me-too, and if they did not have JS to imitate, it would have been even more Microsoftian.<p>VBScript was the alternative to the JS rush job, in my settled view. I don&#x27;t write this out of pride, joy, or defensiveness.

9555289,comment,9552064,9554828,0,0,graycat,,,"An Internet search engine
for the <i>safe for work</i> and <i>legal</i>
Internet content,
searches people want to do,
and results they want to find
where keywords/phrases work
from poorly down to not at all.<p>So my work is for a part of
search served at best poorly now.
Thus, my work is not really
in competition with anything
else out there now.<p>Keywords/phrases often work very
well, and there my work is 
rarely as good.<p>While the broad <i>idea</i> for the
users and the UI are simple
and intuitive, the <i>business model</i>,
UI/UX, data from the user,
database in the server farm,
and the manipulations of all that
data are wildly different from
anything else in <i>search</i>.<p>Can read all you want on the
Internet about various ways
to build a search engine and
still won&#x27;t get even a hint
about how my search engine works,
not the UI and not the core
server side software.<p>Broadly part of the <i>idea</i>
is to give the user search results,
that is, Internet content, that has a
useful approximation to the <i>meaning</i> 
the user wants.  So, the search
engine is trying to <i>get at</i> or
approximate <i>meaning</i>.<p>For this <i>meaning</i>,
there&#x27;s some math 
involved -- original with me,
right, with some theorems and
proofs, typed into Knuth&#x27;s TeX,
and with some advanced prerequisites.
I especially thank A. Kolmogorov.<p>From my Ph.D. and published papers,
I&#x27;m supposed to be able to
do such research in math, and 
I have.<p>Of course the users will not be
aware of anything mathematical --
the math is all buried in the
deepest part of the server side
software.<p>The key part of the whole project 
is just the math:
If stare at the theorems and
proofs of the math, then
can get convinced that it
should work quite well for
its intended part of search.<p>Given the math, the 
software is routine and even
next to trivial.<p>Maybe it is appropriate to call
the project a case of <i>information
technology</i>, but the software is
so simple that it&#x27;s not fair
to say that it is a <i>software</i> project.
Instead, plainly, it&#x27;s a math project,
with some original math,
but might be called an <i>applied</i> math
project.<p>The work is intended to do very
well honoring user privacy.<p>The revenue is from just the
most obvious source -- ads
from ad networks.  And I have
some ideas for especially good
ad targeting, still doing well
on user privacy, I intend to 
implement later.<p>The core software has looked
solid for a long time;
it runs as just some
Windows <i>console</i> applications
that communicate via
TCP/IP sockets and
de/serialization of
instances of a few simple Visual Basic
classes.<p>The timings of the core software
look quite good and much
better with some 
selected use of solid state disks --
write rarely, read frequently.<p>There are good <i>log</i> files
for the Web site and
also the core software.
Fairly simple
processing of the log files
should give a good view
of what the users are doing
and the performance of the
server farm.<p>What&#x27;s left to do is
putting a Web site in front
of that core software.
The software for the Web
pages is also nearly done:
I should be able to get the last
bugs out of the Web pages this
weekend.  The Web pages are so
simple that they should present
no performance challenges.
E.g., the most complicated
Web page sends for only
about 400,000 bits.<p>Fixing the last bugs in the
Web pages, 
then the <i>alpha</i> version
of all the software should be done.
Then I will give a critical review
and do the <i>beta</i> version.<p>I wrote no <i>prototype</i> code;
when the <i>beta</i> version looks
good and is nicely free of bugs,
that will be the production
version 1.0.<p>The code I wrote is as solid
as what a team I was on
at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab
wrote and shipped as
IBM <i>Program Products</i>,
IBM&#x27;s highest quality software
product category.<p>My Web pages are so simple
and small (exactly 800
pixels wide but a user
could get by seeing
only the left 300 pixels of width)
that they should look
good on any screen from
a work station down to
a smart phone.<p>As we know very well by now,
Internet search is just super
important, in the US and
around the world.
Well, a significant fraction of
search is served at best poorly,
and my guess is that 
nearly all Internet users
will want a good search engine
for that fraction and will
be able to see that my work
is by far the best for that fraction.
So, that&#x27;s the source of my
confidence that my project might
be successful.<p>If the project works at all well,
then I shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble,
say, buying a new car!<p>While I&#x27;m a solo founder and
did all the work, on this project
I&#x27;m an entrepreneur, not
a <i>programmer</i>.  If this
project is successful, then
I will want to hire some
people for some routine
programming,
and I will train them
and, then, let the first
such batch set up a training
program, e.g., with video
lectures, for later programmers.
But looking at the job ads, it&#x27;s clear
I&#x27;d never get hired as a programmer.<p>Moreover, the venture capital
people and YC want nothing
to do with me and won&#x27;t until
I have <i>traction</i>.
But for the amount of <i>traction</i>
they want, I would have revenue
enough not to need or be willing to
accept equity funding.
No, I don&#x27;t have 
four kids and a pregnant wife.<p>Also I&#x27;m terrified of the
idea of reporting to a BoD.
I just can&#x27;t think of a
realistic BoD that could
understand the core work.
When at an eary Board meeting
I gave the math for the ad
targeting to be done,
most of the Board members
would get so upset they&#x27;d
leave a smelly trail
all the way to the
little boy&#x27;s or little girl&#x27;s room.
I&#x27;d have hose off and
totally
<i>redecorate</i> the Board
room and everything on the
path to the little rooms.
They&#x27;d try to execute their
<i>fiduciary responsibilities</i>
and, too soon, totally
blow their fuses.<p>One
of the more unpleasant
experiences in life is
listening to a math lecture
with theorems and proofs
where really <i>do</i> want and <i>need</i> to
understand but don&#x27;t have
even 1% of the essential
prerequisites.<p>My guess is that any
usual startup BoD would have
my company totally dead
in less than 18 months.
They might try to <i>save</i>
the company by, say,
selling cupcakes on-line!<p>So, I am 100% owner and should
stay that way.<p>It&#x27;s been noted more than once
in recent months
that it&#x27;s now possible for 
a solo entrepreneur to bring up
a successful Internet based
business.  Actually, so far
I&#x27;ve seen no reason to hire
people.  Instead, it&#x27;s my
business and up to me to
make it go.",1431760144

I seriously doubt that drivers and bikers are deliberately being assholes towards each other (granted a small percentage might be). The drivers simply aren&#x27;t use to having bikes around, and the bikers think they&#x27;re in Denmark or the Netherlands.<p>I ride my bike to work every day, 5km, I bike on the small road in the country side for fun (where there&#x27;s no bike lane) and I never once had an issue that wasn&#x27;t my fault or related to another bike.

They&#x27;re not. Bike stay in the right side of the road at all time, you never mock around in the middle of the street.

9555282,comment,9553168,9553654,0,0,jwr,,,"Agreed. Although I would not fully agree on Wolfram Language being fully &quot;ok&quot;. As a long-time lisper (Clojure, previously Common Lisp) and a heavy Mathematica user I do appreciate the lispy aspects of WL. Yes, you can even write macros, although the syntax is painful.<p>I use Mathematica to solve specific kinds of problems. If there is lots of math involved, for  immediate visualization, for data and problem exploration. But I always find it needlessly painful. The most important drawbacks are:<p>* The language syntax isn&#x27;t as good as a sexp-based lisp. Editing complex expressions is needlessly complex and doesn&#x27;t even compare to structured editing with paredit in Emacs.<p>* The interpreter is slow. Really slow. Sure, if you call a matrix math routine, it will be OK, but try rearranging large data structures and you&#x27;ll end up waiting a lot.<p>* The editor is a disaster. I seriously don&#x27;t know how people can stand it and how come the company invests so little in it. A single mismatched bracket can mean ten minutes of hunting for the problem. Code jumps around on screen all the time, seemingly with no logic to it. Syntax highlighting is nearly non-existent. It&#x27;s a complete trainwreck and I don&#x27;t understand why this isn&#x27;t seen by the company as a huge problem.<p>* Debugging support: what debugging support?<p>* Hash-maps: these were only added recently (!!!) and they are not what I&#x27;d expect in a modern language. For example, if you want to do a map lookup, and your keys aren&#x27;t strings, you need to wrap them in Key[]. Come on.<p>I also found that it&#x27;s very difficult to achieve any kind of code reuse. The process of getting from a prototype to a library has so much friction that people tend to avoid it.<p>I find that I use Mathematica for a limited range of problems. If I could have Mathematica&#x27;s library in Clojure with a graphical REPL, I&#x27;d pick that any day (Clojuratica is a project aiming for that).<p>Also, I don&#x27;t really get the whole &quot;Wolfram Language&quot; vs Mathematica distinction.

Its concurrency model and associated primitives, and the automatic interface system were in roughly the same state then as Rust&#x27;s new ideas are now.<p>That said the ideas in Rust were not as well understood 5 years ago and I doubt that the go creators could have incorporated them well at the time. It took Rust 5 years of experimentation to come to what it is now (and its still got a number of additions to go!).",1428699579

C++, Java, and C# have major differences in their approach to generics, but they have similar syntax so most people gloss over the differences.  I think doing generics well requires incorporating higher order types, higher kinded types, and other concepts which don&#x27;t exist at all in the wild west of C++ templates.  This clumsy implementation leads to monstrosities like std::allocator_traits<std::allocator<T>>::rebind_traits<U>, which would be <i>completely</i> unnecessary if C++ had HKT.

That is exactly what ALEC does.<p>Amazon&#x27;s reversal of a decision to join ALEC without a concomitant reversal or update of that same corporate culture should not be read as a repudiation of that organization&#x27;s aims and goals.<p>I think you&#x27;re scoffing in the wrong direction: Amazon conducts itself repeatedly as antagonistic to regulation and taxation in every way and just about as intensely as a corporation can. The idea that they really don&#x27;t want their business aims written into state law just because they backed away from ALEC fails every test of plausibility. They&#x27;re the same boardroom. They act in their own interest exclusively.  It&#x27;s far more plausible that they saw that being an ALEC member (and taking the public relations costs associated with that) wasn&#x27;t necessary to benefit from what ALEC does on behalf of business interests generally.",1428699424

That book is health cult literature, not a reliable scientific resource. The linked article links to evidence that resistance training can aid health (in elderly subjects). This does not support the idea of high intensity barbell training as a magic injury prevention tool.<p>Everyone who lifts for mass does a lot more higher rep volume than Starting Strength. Lots of guys have strong physiques yet use mostly &quot;inferior&quot; bodyweight exercises and machines. Take a look around you in the gym next time you&#x27;re there and you might be a little surprised :).<p>Weight gain is a problem. Most people have no health reason to gain mass rapidly (or at all), yet many trainees struggle to progress without eating a large calorific surplus. This is a pretty good reason why such a training program should not be your default recommendation!<p>Strength is absolutely not that basis of all fitness. Many extremely fit endurance athletes never lift any weights. Even if this rather bizarre statement was true, it does not explain why powerlifting training of this sort is ideal for everyone. I note that you didn&#x27;t dispute that it will interfere with other physical activity -- one of the most compelling reasons why the average person should not do Starting Strength and why it is most definitely a powerlifting specific training regime.<p>You may have had a great experience with Starting Strength. But other people will often have a very different response to training and health goals.

decomposed using lipid peroxides as initiator of an oxidative chain reaction. The results indicate that 2-nonenal is generated by the oxidative degradation of
w7 unsaturated fatty acids, and suggest that 2-nonenal may be involved in the age-related change of body odor.<p>Is there an a organic-chemistry dermatologist in the house?",1428698718

It&#x27;s pretty much fastest, top-of-the-line components (144 Hz monitor, too!), with a budget AMD chip.

I don&#x27;t think an emphasis on the use of functional constructs follows from this.<p>> rejection of lots of previously-thought-to-be-essential OOP features<p>Yep, this is an important similarity between Go and Rust. Rust brings traits, which are (extremely) similar to Haskell&#x27;s typeclasses, into the mix as well.<p>> built-in concurrency based on a rejection of the traditional primitives<p>Sure, but the differences between the languages is crucial here: Go builds safe(ish) concurrency primitives into the language; Rust does not, but provides language features powerful enough to build memory-safe concurrency primitives in the standard library. And, perhaps surprisingly, mutexen and the like are actually encouraged precisely because Rust can make them safer.<p>> general de-emphasis of metaprogramming constructs like templates and macros<p>I don&#x27;t agree that Rust de-emphasizes these. Generic programming is strongly encouraged, and indeed Rust&#x27;s generics are implemented very similarly to C++ templates. Rust also strongly encourages the use of macros for cleaning up repetitive blocks of code, both inside of and outside of function bodies.

Though the coding can be somewhat tedious and rigid, in the end these shortcomings have been outweighed by the typical practical considerations -- low risk, extremely portable, tight control over locality and thus performance, etc. It&#x27;s obviously not all or nothing - as you say we could choose something even lower level and possibly get better performance, but when seen from the perspective of the near and mid-term application goals, it&#x27;s hard to make a different choice unless explicitly tasked with doing so.",1428698062

9356930,comment,9354883,9355573,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is going to be a bit abstract, but hopefully it still makes sense.<p>In particle physics there are a couple important fundamental principles, one of the most basic is the various conservation rules. Energy/mass, charge, lepton number, baryon number, etc, all of these things are conserved. But that leaves open a big window, because it means you can have any sort of particle reaction possible as long as you have enough energy and the various other &quot;quantum numbers&quot; (charge, leptons, whatever) are <i>balanced</i>. So, for example, if you have nothing more than high energy photons (gamma rays) you can create particle/anti-particle pairs easily (such as electrons/positrons) because in those situations everything that should be conserved is exactly balanced (since anti-particles have opposite charge, spin, lepton number, and so on). You can get more complex particle reactions so long as they are still balanced.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you want to study a particular particle. If those particles aren&#x27;t naturally occurring, like protons or neutrons or electrons, then you&#x27;ll need to figure out how to create them. And that means creating conditions where there&#x27;s more energy available than the energy required for reactions that involve those particles. For example, the LHC was operating at 7 TeV total energy for collisions, which enabled them to discover the 125 GeV Higgs boson. Note that there&#x27;s a significant difference in those energy levels (nearly a factor of 100), and this is because the process is somewhat inefficient and random and also there&#x27;s some overhead in the reactions. For example, you need twice the energy of an electron particle in order to see electron-positron creation reactions, due to that balancing aspect.<p>Ultimately what you have is a huge collection of reactions due to particle collisions at a given energy level. And these reactions can be compared against the reactions you&#x27;d expect to see. With more energy in the collisions you push out the &quot;search space&quot; into different realms involving different particles and different phenomena. You can then use that data to perform &quot;tests&quot;, by comparing what you actually see to what you&#x27;d expect to see given certain theories (such as the Higgs-mechanism theory), and in that way verify or falsify a theory. The more energy you have the easier it is to search for higher energy particles and phenomena.<p>The LHC energy boost will make it possible to explore new realms of physics. To either rule out the existence of potential particles at certain mass levels or to establish their existence, as with the Higgs-boson. It&#x27;ll make it possible to narrow down some constraints on the Higgs-mechanism theory as well as potentially fill in some details (or rule out some possibilities) with regard to Dark Matter.",1428697807

9356866,comment,9355382,9356234,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> Go has very different design goals than Rust, so very little that Rust does would actually be possible in Go, and vice versa.<p>Oh give this lame argument a rest already. They&#x27;re both supposedly general-purpose programming languages. Rust shoots for a little lower level than Go, but they can certainly be compared, and the comparisons are valid.<p>> Having a complex type system would cut into compile times (an explicit primary design goal, to the point where the Go compiler must be written to read each file exactly once[0], no more).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this is a defense of Go: yes, that&#x27;s a primary design goal; it&#x27;s also a terrible design goal. Trading an adequate type system for a short-term gain in compile time is an amateurish mistake.<p>Compilation time can be mitigated on even the largest projects by only rebuilding changed modules. If you&#x27;re getting to the point that this isn&#x27;t working, then maybe it&#x27;s time to start working on reducing the size of your code.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on projects that were 500,000 lines of code and compile time was sometimes an issue, but not nearly as large an issue as bugs which would have been caught by an adequate type system (large C#/Java codebases pre-generics).<p>> As for the code you&#x27;re referring to, Go is not designed to be a language which prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot with provable code. It&#x27;s designed to be a language which makes it reasonably easy to be sure you haven&#x27;t, as long as you follow the general idioms and best practices. What you&#x27;re describing here is definitely not one - I can think of a few instances in which pointers might be reasonably passed over a channel, but they&#x27;re few and far between.<p>We&#x27;ve tried this approach before, many, many times, and the result has been high-profile bugs.<p>The fact is, these &quot;idioms and best practices&quot; <i>will not</i> be followed perfectly on projects of any reasonable size if they are not enforced by code. Why would you <i>not</i> enforce them with code? And if you&#x27;re designing a language, why not design the language in such a way as to allow code enforcing best practices? Like, a type system?<p>> Also, I would think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that once you&#x27;ve sent something over a channel you shouldn&#x27;t try and write to it anymore[1].<p>Yes, just like it&#x27;s pretty obvious that when you free memory you shouldn&#x27;t write to it any more. We&#x27;ve never had any issues with that, now have we?<p>> It&#x27;s definitely possible to extend `go vet` to handle this, and it may even be possible to write this in as a compiler error in a future version of Go.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about `go vet` and I wish I didn&#x27;t.<p>So, to avoid a second pass over the code during compilation, you add a second pass over the code during `go vet` that has less capabilities. Good thinking. I&#x27;ll add that onto the list of other stupid ideas that have been tried decades ago and didn&#x27;t work but are finding new life in Go.<p>> Incidentally, one of the reasons that it&#x27;s so easy to do reliable static analysis on Go code (compared to other languages) is that the grammar is incredibly simple - it&#x27;s almost entirely context-free, which is very rare among non-Lisps. Having a more complex type system usually requires at least some additional syntax to along with this, which means you&#x27;d have to start sacrificing this design goal as well in order to create a more elaborate type system.<p>Yes, adding syntax for static type checking will definitely make static analysis like type checking harder. <i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>",1428697057

This was scary because Facebook owns a ton of patents and if Zuckerberg woke up on the wrong side of the bed one morning and decided to sue everyone with their portfolio of patents, it would be impossible to countersue if you used any Facebook code.  The other posts go into how companies like Google and Facebook use patents as a way of ensuring mutually assured destruction, and if Google had used Facebook code under the license it would be like Google disarming all their nuclear bombs against facebook.<p>IANAL, but it seems the new license is a bit more GPL-esque in its restrictions by saying if you use this software than you cannot sue Facebook, its subsidiaries, and your parent weapon of choice can&#x27;t be based off Facebook software (or else you lose the software license). However if Facebook sues you, then you don&#x27;t lose the license and you are free to counter sue facebook with your nuclear arsenal of patents.<p>The reason I call it GPL-esque is it seems to introduce restrictions on how you can legally use the software once you&#x27;ve incorporated it (like how the GPL prevents you from not redistributed the source code), the Facebook license seems to prevent you from launching patent claims that are built off Facebook software. My guess is that if enough people used this license it would be difficult to litigate anyone else without revoking some of your software licenses.<p>Finally, I never took a law class a day in my life and the closest domain knowledge is an intro to econ class I took in freshman year of college so I could 100% wrong.<p>[1]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9271246"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9271246</a>

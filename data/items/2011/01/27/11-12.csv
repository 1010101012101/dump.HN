2147475,comment,2147306,2147436,0,0,dkersten,,,"I dunno.. I think our corporate tax does have a lot, if not close to everything, to do with companies basing their European headquarters here (eg, see Double Irish/Dutch Sandwich [1]). Our spoken English isn't as amazing as you make it out to be (its certainly not bad, but <i>best in the world</i>?? besides, have you ever been to Cork ;-) or certain parts of Dublin for that matter...) and while the ""free"" fees certainly helped our education, I still feel our education is inferior to a lot of the rest of the world. For example, computer science-related courses are still not attracting as many students as it should, even though, here in Ireland, IT jobs are much more plentiful than others [2].<p>Of course, regardless of how great we think we are as a startup hub, I've seen very little focus on startups here. Besides the occasional startup weekend, nubie.ie and Enterprise Ireland (which, IMHO, isn't very useful to a lot of - if not most - Internet tech startups), I see absolutely nothing here that shows any kind of innovation or advancements in the way of startups. Which is a pity, because I think that would be a great start to improving the economic situation.<p><i>university students majoring in ""safe"" subjects like arts, languages or business rather than mathematics and computer science</i><p>Funnily (or sadly) enough, I think the ""safe"" subjects are the ones that are really feeling the full force of the economic problems, while jobs in sciences, from where I stand anyway, are reasonably plentiful (well, compsci anyway, I haven't paid much attention to others since they're not relevant to me personally).<p><i>Even for those students majoring in compsci, they gear you towards getting a job, not starting your own company.</i><p>Agreed. This is definitely the case here. I think its holding back our potential, but I don't know what could be done about it really.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-sho...</a><p>[2] for example, <a href=""http://irishdev.com/Home/News/1403-The-State-of-Play--IT-Graduates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://irishdev.com/Home/News/1403-The-State-of-Play--IT-Gra...</a> though from personal experience I know this to be true for all kinds of computer/programming related jobs",1296129492

2147455,comment,2144956,2144956,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"There are lots and lots and LOTS of female entrepreneurs who start all kinds of business. I know - I searched aggressively for women entrepreneurs to see if I could find any who met my criteria, so I could invite them to speak at my conference.<p>Many women innovate in fields they're interested in, including physical goods manufacture. Many women start social-oriented web sites (not nec. products). Incredible amounts of women are freelancers, consultants, coaches, trainers, writers, etc.<p>There are hundreds of thousands of western, middle-class women who work as much if not more than the mythical ""startup founder"" -- on other business endeavors.<p>This pretty much invalidates the ""women don't want to start companies"" and ""women don't want to work much"" theories.<p>The question is, why don't they do product businesses?<p>I have a ""tech startup."" This time a year ago, it was bringing in $3k a month. Now it's $15k. By the end of the next 12 mos, it'll be earning nearly half a million dollars a year. I'm not living off ramen and working 90 hour weeks - to the contrary, I spend maybe 20% time on the app and my husband & I have apartments in Vienna, Austria and Philadelphia, NYC, and a really nice car ;)<p>That's why I'm trying to bring the products gospel to people (including women) who would otherwise stay employed or start consulting businesses.<p>I think that women, on average, are more interested in different fields than men. But products cut across all fields.<p>PS - And before you ask - no, my husband is not a breadwinner. He and I both quit consulting to work on our apps & products. The money ideas are almost always mine.)<p>I do complain about working too much on Twitter, but that's because I've had a low-grade chronic illness for the past 1.5 yrs and it's got me down.

By providing those links quickly and easily Google is arguably <i>improving</i> the quality of the search results for its end users.<p>Now, I'm with you that I'd rather that the search results were <i>worse</i> in this specific way, but this sort of thing is surely a direct result of algorithmically optimising search results to present the user with what they're after even if they don't necessarily know exactly how to find it, a general good and a defeating of the sort of SEO techniques we usually complain about here.<p>In general though - Google already has a 'SafeSearch' function for images, which seems to work tolerably well without complaint. Perhaps a similar system could be introduced both for results and suggestions so that these to illegal content and sites they consider likely to harm my computer could be filtered out by default and only returned if I specifically set the preference or search terms to look for them?",1296126076

I also have a significant investment in Firewire camera gear, because USB just doesn't cut it for streaming live HD video. However, I would love to abandon Firewire in favor of an optimized USB, if for no other reason that USB has wide industry support, and Firewire seems to be fading away due to its licensing issues.",1262300398

1025143,comment,1024850,1024850,0,0,Flemlord,,,"Interesting article but it doesn't address the root issue. Israel has real threats to deal with on a weekly if not daily basis. They're forced to take security seriously and it shows in their procedures. Their security employees deal with regular, serious threats and one would assume numerous close calls have made them self-motivated.<p>On the other hand, North American countries only have one real threat every 10-odd years or so. In fact, the most recent attempt didn't even go through North American screening. Since we don't have real terrorists often enough to matter, I doubt American security will ever come close to the Israeli model.<p>What if you were building a software package that you knew would never have any users? Could you motivate your team to care enough to make the software great? Could you yourself be motivated to do a good job, or would you just go through the motions?",1262300204

1025135,comment,1024850,1025094,0,0,mdasen,,,"I didn't vote either way on it.  That said, I can see a few reasons why it might be downmodded.<p>On the surface side, its use of profanity and the attitude that I read from the comment aren't useful for criticism.  A more useful way of phrasing it might have been along the lines of, ""Focusing on the intent of the traveler may help sometimes, but it can also lead to events such as this one where an innocent person's laptop is destroyed based on a feeling.""  NOTE: I can't actually watch the video because my laptop has no sound right now.  The way one phrases something matters and, at least to me, it seemed like more of an emotional attack than a response to procedures that may or may not be good.<p>On the deeper side, one event does not a trend make.  The comment author provided a video about an event.  It's somewhat like linking to a video of an NFL game where the Chief's won and saying they're a good football team - or linking to a video of the Saint's loss and saying they're a bad team.  Sure, it is evidence of badness, but it's one piece among 15 this season and the majority of evidence points the other way.  Now, going back to Israel, I'm not making a claim that the majority of evidence goes either way.  I am trying to say that Israeli security deals with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people every year and to judge whether they have their act together or not cannot hinge on one piece of evidence.<p>And, to be frank, that's part of the problem with your reading of the comment: it isn't part of Israeli standard procedure.  If one has reports of it happening in a systemic way, that's important.  Heck, it's important that it happened even once.  However, an isolated incident can be tragic without being indicative of anything.  It was a bad thing that happened.  It was good that it got press (as I heard she got monetary compensation from the government).  However, a report from an organization that looks into this stuff and spots trends is a more persuasive thing than one incident.<p>Although, if it were phrased more pleasantly, the author might not have been downmodded.  Then it might be seen as someone offering alternative evidence arguing that the situation isn't as rosy as the original article implied and that it's a more complex situation.  However, the phrasing makes it seem like the original author wishes for us to throw out all other evidence because of one piece they have chosen to present and have that one piece preferenced over others.<p>If I had wanted to bring that video into the discussion, I would have said something like:<p>""The article paints a rosy picture of the situation, but it's one that turns on human intellect and 'gut feelings' which isn't a great way to run a security system.  People sometimes have gut feelings (conscious or not) that are biased on things like race, religion, gender, etc.  and might single out people not because of what's in their eyes, but something else.  Likewise, it could mean that sometimes people have gut feelings that are wrong - people might be legitimately nervous not because they are planning something bad - and that can lead to situations like [the video]. . .""",1262299645

No built-in keyboard, no protection, no way to stand it up for a good viewing angle, pretty much the same complaints you give here.  My newt's leather carrying case had a little fold-out bit that propped the newt up at an adjustable angle and held the keyboard in place so that I could unzip it on a tabletop, adjust the prop, and have my ""laptop"" ready to go.  When I wanted to be more portable I could disconnect the keyboard, slide the newt out of the case, and walk away.<p>It is more portable than a netbook because it can do away with the keyboard.  Any keyboard worth using cannot fit into a netbook.  Period.  By eliminating the keyboard you have more design freedom than the netbook form-factor allows.",1262297086

So even if the memory is twice as fast, and each processor twice as slow, memory access is still the dominating factor in efficiency.<p>You can work round that by being vary careful, arranging things so that processors access memory in sequence, which lets reads be coallesced (you're streaming data from continguous addresses, avoiding the ""seek time"" of random access).  But that only works if all the processors are focussed on the same job.<p>Now you can say I'm just describing the standard problems with GPU, and I'd agree, but my point is that even in Fermi (which is a huge step forwards in many ways) these will still dominate.  And it's hard to see how most software fits into such an approach.  Hence my warning that they are not becoming general purpose.",1262297069

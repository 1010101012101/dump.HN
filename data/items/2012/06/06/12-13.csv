From what I can tell the easy money in the app store is long gone and conditions do not favor the lone developer now. I have two iPad apps that frequently appear in the ""What's Hot"" list for music and if the revenue they generate is any indication most of us would be better off working as fry cooks.<p>The web gives you so much more insight into your potential customer's behavior that I think that alone might make it a better bet for a solo dev.<p>If you do decide to go solo I'd strongly recommend you hire a professional designer.

But in the 21st century well you can't adopt to new times by charging more from everyone you can. By doing simply that, you will pervert the very idea behind the system.

4073504,comment,4071744,4073372,3,0,jkn,,,"Exactly, and my point is that currently my ISP assigns IPv4 addresses dynamically, so I'll get a different one every time I turn on my ADSL modem. I think this is quite common, and as a consequence IPv4 addresses are not a reliable way of identifying a home computer. If every home connection is assigned a static IPv6 prefix, that becomes a reliable identifier. Then you can credibly say ""This comment on my blog is from the same computer as this Wikipedia edit from last month!"", something you currently cannot say for home computers in general (while work computers are much more likely to have static IPv4 addresses and in that case IPv6 doesn't make it worse).<p>As I understand it, the privacy extensions in IPv6 were designed to solve another, bigger privacy concern that was totally absent from IPv4: if the second part of the IP address is based on the MAC address, then smartphones and laptops can be traced globally, no matter where they connect to the network (home, hotel room, 3G...)",1338987489

4073499,comment,4073193,4073193,7,0,BenjaminDyer,,,"Payments is a really exciting space at the moment, its being disrupted at an impressive rate and it seems a new provider pops up almost every day. While its great to read this story I believe to a certain extent at the moment its better the devil you know, especially if you are an established business.<p>I always recommend PayPal to our merchants, not only is it the quickest way to send and receive money online its also backed up by one of the largest payment networks in the world. Also lots of people have money in paypal accounts they would like to spend, not everyone links it back to their bank account. For E-Commerce sites you can expect to loose about 10% of sales by not offering PayPal. However, I appreciate its not for everyone.<p>For alternatives, here I think it really depends on the size and type of your business. If you are doing any type of volume the only serious way to receive payments online is via a Payment Service Provider (PSP), and there are millions of them. You can seriously reduce your transaction costs and often you get some pretty weapons grade anti fraud protection thrown in. Unfortunately setting up a PSP isn't as simple as it sounds, its a two stage process starting with a Merchant Account. This space is pretty dominated by the traditional banks so get ready for a little red tape. Once you have your Merchant Account the PSP slice is normally fairly painless.<p>With regards to Stripe, I'd personally give any startup in this space some time to debug and increase transactions before you trust them with your business.<p>Nice read.",1338987416

4073485,comment,4068561,4068561,1,0,jaldoretta,,,"I think a lot of these comments are focusing on the wrong part of the text. I think what the author is really trying to convey is that taking standardized tests is not going to make a child want to grow up to build rockets or robots.<p>I'm a mechanical engineer and attended a technical university, and from my experience, most of the other students in technical fields are ones that grew up with an innate interest in building things and creating things. Not all children do things like that in their spare time. And not all parents give their children the opportunity to do things like that in their spare time.<p>Spending time in school taking standardized tests instead of performing scientific experiments and building things makes children bored with science and math. It is, very sadly, a wasted opportunity. Most children have no idea how exciting science and technology can be. All they know is sitting in class, reading books, working boring problems.<p>When a child gets to high school and starts applying (or not applying) for colleges, they are going to choose a subject that they remember being interesting. Most children that I have met do not find taking tests and reading about science to be interesting.<p>If children were more involved in the learning process through hands-on experiences, imagine the kind of excitement that would be generated among the young people. Imagine the kinds of things we would be capable of as a species if there were more people excited and invested in science and technology.<p>I realize that most of the readers of Hacker News were probably the children that grew up wanting to build and create. But there are so many children out there who need to be inspired in order to succeed, and those are the ones that are being failed by our flawed education system.",1338987287

Back then, there were two options:<p>1. Allow copying for private purposes, introduce a flat fee on empty media (tapes back then, later cassettes, cd-roms, ...)<p>2. Ban all private copying, prosecute it at all costs. Ban tape drives, control all technology that can be used for private copying.<p>3. Copy as copy can, no one gets paid. Ignore that this may be an issue for people that depend on producing (music, films, ...)<p>The (IMHO wise) decision was to stick with option (1), so that's where we're at. The GEMA and ZP, as much hate is directed at them and as much as is wrong with them, are tasked with collection that fee. It's their job and they do it, even if it's unpopular. It's a bit like the Finanzamt (IRS). You don't have to like them, but at least keep in mind that they're doing what they have to.<p>Now, one may argue that the current system is not suitable for the digital age where empty media is used for so much more than copying audio, or even that the whole GEMA system should be abandoned - and I'm actually on your side in that respect - but well, that's a different topic.<p>You could also appeal to the regulatory body and argue that the price is too high, and that's what the bitcom rightfully does, but then you'd have to settle on an acceptable price. So what's acceptable? I don't have an answer, do you? They'll eventually figure this out and the high prices demanded are part of their negotiation strategy.",1338985561

I'm very biased, I love fish for many reasons and despite the claims that zsh can do the same things I've never had cause to switch from it. Now it was quite disappointing to see the original fish project seemingly halted. So this isn't simply great news, in the sense that development has been picked back up in the fishfish fork, some great improvements have been made at the same time!<p><pre><code>    * autosuggestion\n      (this actually has a great amount of utility for me.\n       it complements tab-completion quite well!)\n    \n    * optional web-based config\n      (great for quickly editing your config settings)\n    \n    * speed improvements\n      (although I never suffered from much lag with fish\n       to begin with)\n</code></pre>\nOverall I think the usability and utility of fish is greatly improved in this fork. Also it's worth pointing out that in terms of out-of-box functionality, some of fishfish features would be very hard to match. Things like autocompletion and simple history scrollback based one partial string matching set fish apart from the pack imo. So far, I'm quite impressed and I hope that more people adopt fishfish as the de facto replacement for fish.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fishshell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fishshell.com/</a>",1338985295

4073293,story,,,1,0,adviceonly,"Tell HN: ""Hacker"" is the new ""Go-go""",,"Possibly thanks to YC, the term ""Hacker"" has yet again been redefined. I've been reading HN a few years now, commenting under various pseudonyms, and find it perfectly acceptable that YC and PG call people hackers, even though these ""new hackers"" aren't hackers in the original sense of the unix neckbeards, the definition of Hacker by Eric Raymond, nor are they Kevin Mitnick or characters played by Matthew Broderick or Keanu Reeves. They aren't anything currently defined in Wikipedia:<p>1. Hacker (computer security) or cracker, who accesses a computer system by circumventing its security system<p>2. Hacker (hobbyist), who makes innovative customizations or combinations of retail electronic and computer equipment<p>3. Hacker (programmer subculture), who shares an anti-authoritarian approach to software development now associated with the free software movement<p>However, I now see Javascript programmers calling themselves ""hackers"". And at first I think, ""No, you're not!"" However, by the YC definition, maybe they are. Basically, if you are a freelancer or entrepreneur and can code, you may be a hacker.<p>This reminds me of how I grew up thinking Go-go was a table dancer, and then I realized it was a great 80's band, and then realized that the band wasn't that great when I saw them play on SNL. It turns out that there are also a lot of definitions of Go-go also:<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_go_%28disambiguation%29",1338984272

Even worse, this one can be attacked in court because it is obviously unfair.<p>This is the only situation I know, where a company distributes their product for free and then asks everybody to pay for it. This is a special situation of course, because the public broadcasting has the official task to educate and report in a neutral way. This is welcome - no doubt.<p>But the presence in the internet and thus on computers is no excuse to collect money from everybody. In contrary, the presence of the internet allows to measure exactly, who is using the services. \nIn a few years from now, perhaps even today, it would be possible to do the same with the wireless receivers, like TV.<p>So it would be easy to charge the households who use the service.

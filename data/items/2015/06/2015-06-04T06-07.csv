9657753,comment,9656998,9657713,0,0,bad_user,,,"You should be a little careful. The odd thing about creative professionals, which includes most software developers, is that if you take Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs as the truth for the general population, for creative professionals this pyramid of needs is inverted.<p>You see, most creative professionals are profoundly unhappy people. This is because the equation for happiness is usually easy - your expectations have to be lower than your achievements. As a side note, this is why the renowned mid-life crisis happens, because that&#x27;s the point in your life when you realize that many of your dreams are impossible.<p>But going back to creative professionals - our expectations are off the chart. It&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve been taught that we can achieve anything, with our imagination being the limit and hard work being the currency. It&#x27;s because many of us come from families of high achievers. Yes, we are profoundly unhappy because our expectations are usually much bigger than our achievements. This is the reason for why many of us are idealists, for why we want to change the world. Many of us are also atheists, but all of us want to achieve some form of immortality, therefore that&#x27;s the reason for why many of us want to build things that are long lasting.<p>I used to say the same things as you did. You may not feel the above right now, I&#x27;m going to make the assumption that you&#x27;re in your twenties, which means you&#x27;ve got the energy to be hopeful about the future. But take it from a 32 year old that is going through a mid-life crisis 10 years earlier (or maybe it&#x27;s just a burnout episode, I don&#x27;t know), but this youthful energy is going to dissipate and you&#x27;re then going to feel the emptiness in your life. And I&#x27;m lucky, because I have a wife and a 4-year old whom I love very much and which represent my reason for getting up in the morning.",1433401000

9657725,comment,9657158,9657502,0,0,AnEngineer,,,"And my reply:<p>I agree that there are complexities (as you state, “certain realities”) inherent in distributed systems. If there is one thing I believe we could both agree upon is that distributed systems increase the surface area of complexity exponentially when compared to the relatively simpler stack of clients communicating with one system.<p>Failures in a distributed environment must be expected. Embraced even, since treating them as “an exception” is tantamount to the proverbial ostrich poking its head into the sand.<p>However, failure in a distributed system does not necessitate “Frontend and UX folks” having to address failures which are not directly a result of client communication with the next tier. For example, should the UX be prepared to handle when the primary provider of a service is down and fail over to a secondary system? If the service is the one which the client is directly interacting with, then likely that makes sense.<p>But what of the case when the primary system has issues interacting with its collaborators? Such as its persistent store. Or a strategic partner providing required functionality for the workflow. Is it your position that this type of failure be handled by the UX?<p>Why wouldn’t a server maintain separation of concerns and only communicate to a client when its options have been exhausted? IOW, why assume what “the other side of the connection” is going to do in order to satisfy a request placed on it?<p>In summary, my position is that when the collaborators in a distributed system have a well defined software contracts (protocol, expectations, etc.) and all parties adhere to them (without assumptions in implementation), then this allows the system(s) involved to provide resilience in depth. However, the fashionable trend of replicating a PowerBuilder environment does not lend itself to these separation of concerns.<p>Foisting complexity to either end of the spectrum is where truly nasty problems are bred.",1433398831

We are told the TPP and all of those other agreements will be great for our countries, but will they?<p>The TPP specifically is a horrible piece of work. I understand free trade agreements are beneficial to keeping the economy going, but Australia (where I reside) ironically already has trade agreements with 8 of the 11 participating countries in the TPP anyway.

If we even get these exemptions will be another matter entirely. Extending the duration under which pharmaceutical companies can block out generic medicines is a lose-lose situation for the poor.<p>I&#x27;m scared for what the future holds.

Traditionally, Network Engineers are experienced with Vendor provided solutions (Juniper, Cisco, etc) and most interviews would cover experience implementing/supporting different types of architecture using these Vendor provided solutions. Facebook Engineering exemplified a refreshing new approach where Network Engineers are also Software Developers, and the focus/goal is to proactively correct and automate Network Engineer tasks. This means there is less time fighting fires, and more time building solutions. I found this to be an interesting new approach (for me anyway). So conceptually, I could see this working; an HR person that can write the company HR tools, marketing and sales people that write their own tools, etc.",1433397820

Basically you run Amazon provided agent on an EC2 instance and ECS will see it as a host for ECS.<p>Also Amazon bills you for that EC2 instance as any other instance.<p>Personally I have hard time understanding the benefits of running docker in public cloud, you still run a VM you still pay for that VM. It just one extra abstraction layer which increases complexity of your infrastructure and also reduces performance.<p>I do understand the benefits of using containers in own data center, when you run it on bare hosts. There&#x27;s simplicity and and lower costs (because you don&#x27;t have VM) you have more resources which lets you run more containers than VMs on that host.",1433397813

Microsoft makes an operating system that runs on a distributed hardware ecosystem and they have the unenviable task of making the user with crappy (but cheap) hardware actually work.  Apple is completely vertically integrated, so they can make sure everything works smoothly in their vision, but you only get Apple&#x27;s vision.<p>Then you have Linux, which is a distributed software ecosystem on top of a distributed hardware ecosystem.  UX is terrible, but flexibility is through the roof.  You can pretty much have exactly what you want, although you might have to do parts of it yourself.",1433397715

You could say the same about the wealthy. I grew up in relative poverty in a wealthy environment and I really would say that character deficits can be found in the same percentages across the board. The difference may be that the wealthy don&#x27;t have a need to expose their desperation in such public ways and if you&#x27;re thinking of things like thievery and drug abuse you may be seeing things through a certain lens (not to assume anything about you personally).",1389446259

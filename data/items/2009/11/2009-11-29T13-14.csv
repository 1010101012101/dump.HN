966326,comment,966283,966283,0,0,patio11,,,"I have heard variations of this story quite a bit (two members of my family nurse on-again-off-again dreams of going into the business, and I read a lot).  The industry is very, very overdependent on outdated, inefficient methods of moving books because it is the only thing they think they have -- basically, there are no options between getting approved by kingmakers like Oprah or the New York Times and doing book tours to have the author hand books to readers directly.<p>This is <i>insane</i>.  Can you imagine how little work I'd get done if, after being rejected by the New York Times, my marketing effort was going to little collections of teachers, giving a speech, and trying to persuade them to play bingo with their classes?  And I make <i>a lot</i> more off a marginal sale than the average midlist author does.<p>Thankfully, some authors are finally starting to get clueful.  They're doing things like having a blog and an email list.  (I will bet you any amount of money that the anonymous author cannot identify her hard-core fans by name or contact them in any way.  What the <i>heck</i>.  Screw the New York Times, <i>these</i> are the people who you should be most worried about getting your next book to because you <i>know</i> they will love it and tell everyone they know about it.)<p>I think that is pretty much the way forward for midlist authors: do your own marketing, talk directly to your readers, cut out the middlemen wherever possible.  Midlist authors don't make a lot of money or sell a lot of books in the status quo.  You can probably do better just being a micro-celebrity on the Internet: beloved by the ""thousand true fans"" that know and talk to you, and selling to folks a bit wider than that social circle.<p>It beats sitting at the kitchen table waiting for rejection letters.",1259502922
966325,comment,965978,966232,0,0,p47,,,"In addition to viraptor's post. I want just add that for sure some Poles we're anti-Semitic. But labeling whole nation like this is a terrible mistake, which lead humanity to at least one holocaust.
In 1930 Jews were 11% of Poland's population. There we're 116 Jewish newspapers. 
In September 1939, around 120k Jews fight with Germans in Polish Army (as officers as well, please find officer in Whermaht or in SS) against Germans and Russians. All pow's with Jewish ancestors we're murdered by Germans :-/, only because they we're Jewish.<p>Well what my point is, you cannot say things like this, it's just wrong. You're harming a memory of wonderful and amazing cultural contribution.<p>I would gladly show you Łódź or Kraków in Poland, so you can witness with your eyes, how wonderful we're coexistence of Poles and Jews.",1259502774

As my eyes age, I appreciate more and more large-format displays. I am using a Dell 2709WFP on a 13"" Macbook Pro 2.53. The very beautiful (both aesthetically and technically) Apple 24"" LED-backlit display is somehow too small after seeing a 27"" with the same content. (How're you gonna keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Paree?"")<p>I am actually one of those liberal, Obama-voting hybrid Mac users who has used Macintoshes since the first Bloom-County classic Mac in 1984. I also have always had to use both platforms, because as much as I would like it to be otherwise, business runs on Windows, very probably because of the misguided belief that cheap hardware makes their IT solutions cost-effective. Every single day of my life I have had some unwelcomed anomaly happen on my Windows computer. This is great for those in IT who make a living chasing Windows bugs, but is false economy for business in general. Even to this day, Microsoft Word runs better under Windows that it does on OSX. Too bad.",1259502711

966319,comment,966283,966283,0,0,neilk,,,"Maybe this is tangential, but sometimes when I go into the bookstore, I ask myself how many of these books were really necessary. They're filling some sort of need, it just isn't for information. The shelves with the most new books are invariably the topics that nobody knows <i>anything</i> about, like business or love.<p>I guess I'm asking how many authors we really need.

The article and the comments should not cause any trepidation about coming to India, but re-double your resolve. It's like ""shooting fish in a barrel"" if you figure it out!<p>Sort of hard to explain to people who are not in the thick of this battle. And, talking is not how you figure this out. But, if you are a startup type* - tenacity of a bulldog, super hard-working, high integrity, passion driven - I would be happy to offer you work opportunities that will enable you to figure out the formula of how to take advantage of all of this. Note:
1) only way to figure it out is to jump into the war (say 6 months)
2) for these 6 months you'll have to work on my projects
3) it will be all about execution, not talk. so it's imperative that you're a get shit done type. 4) in these 6 months, whenever you run into ""india issues"" being discussed in this thread, I will work with you (show you) how to overcome them with relative ease.<p>*most Indians educated in ivy-league-type schools and then having worked for blue chip corps like msft, P&G, etc are NOT start-up types imho<p>If interested, email me udai00(at)gmail.com",1259502099

Customers tolerate missing features surprisingly well, and if they don't there are more fish in the sea.<p>Missing promised shipping dates, on the other hand, costs you tremendously disproportionate amounts of goodwill.  <i>Making them</i> often requires stress wildly disproportionate to the business value involved.<p>Example: When I started (and was stupid), if a customer asked me ""Does the software do $FOO?"", and $FOO was in active development, I'd say ""I'm working on $FOO right now and it should be ready on $ESTIMATE.""  Often $ESTIMATE was about a week away.  Now that I'm older and wiser, I say ""$FOO is not ready but it is planned for a later version of the software.  Would you like me to email you when $FOO is ready?""<p>This happened not two weeks ago with an enhancement to the online version of my software.  It didn't support consistent columns yet (some users to call bingo games by word and column, which cuts search times for players down drastically, especially important when you're playing with older folks who don't have great eyesight).  I've implemented that in Java before and thought it would take me less than one day in Ruby, and had a Saturday free.  When I was young and stupid I would have said ""I expect to have that done on Sunday.""  Good thing I didn't -- Friday I got enough overtime piled on to totally exhaust me, and I didn't get up until 3 PM on Saturday, with a planned social engagement at 6.  But its <i>all OK</i> because my customer doesn't know any of this!  It just took me until this weekend -- I sat down, banged it out, and just emailed her about it.  If she buys, great, if not, none of us is worse off.",1259501884

Ok - maybe here: Jews were living in Poland on mostly the same laws as locals. They were separated and killed by Germans just because they came from Jewish families. Do you see the difference? I could write many things about families in Warsaw trying to keep runaways from ghetto in hiding, etc. but that doesn't even matter at this point...<p>Jews may have experienced lots of extreme nationalism in Poland (before the war) simply because of their numbers - but they were not put in death camps then!",1259500512

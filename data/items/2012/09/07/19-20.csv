All other cases in WW I/II have been laid behind them by the victims, but this.<p>To the other arguments might be added that more Jews had to flee in the Middle East (including the West Bank 1948) than Palestinians 1948. Ethnic cleansing -- because of their religion, not in the middle of a dirty civil war...<p>Those Jews got most assets stolen, including multiple times larger area than Israel itself. Why is there no indignation at all?!<p>I could probably add more. But the previous two which the left <i>ignores</i> are at least as bad as anything Israel has done, even with the left's description of Israel.<p>I can't use any milder description than ""disgusting double standards"", especially if you add the non-criticism of state supported nazi hate propaganda...<p>Re crime:<p>>>There's a wealth of evidence that longer prison sentences don't deter crime any more than short ones<p>I've heard that sentence length is irrelevant since I started school, but... It seems just too close to other lies they fed us in Swedish school.<p>1. Is that measured for first time criminals only? It is a big step to risk jail.<p>2. To simplify, there are two types of criminals. The first are the idiots that drink beer on a Saturday and get in a knife fight and the second type consider and weigh for/against like any other entrepeneur. How is the sentence length sensitivity if you ignore things like drunks that knife each others?<p>3. Sentences have influence. A proof: If there was a death sentence for e.g. jay walking, not even <i>I</i> would do it (sober, see 2.). But -- I wouldn't jaywalk even if it was just one year in jail. In that way, there is no influence by sentence length -- is that how the claim is measured?<p>4. But certainly, psychopaths are not that influenced by punishment...<p>>>[psychopaths are a tiny part of the prison population and can be handled as a separate case]<p>Do you have a reference for the claim?<p>The figures I've seen (easy to google, from Hare afaik) say 20% of the US prison population, 50%(!) of all violent crime. That is hardly something minimal to just ignore...?!<p>>> a typical burglar is more in need of help from society than their typical victim<p>I know of a couple of females that were very, very upset over a burglary and had e.g. nerve problems and problems sleeping home for quite a while. I slept with a couple of knives for a couple of months.<p>I only know about Sweden. Afaik, there are two types of burglars:<p>- Hard drug users. The logical solution is <i>not</i> to give them short sentences if they aren't likely to have stopped the drugs -- for their own sake.<p>- International crime syndicates -- see type two above (entrepeneur).",1347046362

Seriously, what else are they doing with that 3% of all those transactions?<p>Primarily because we accept the status quo because the merchant is in such a weak bargaining position. Let us not forget that merchants and consumers form the basis of our economy whereas payment and banking systems are just plumbing.<p>If the financial industry had more incentive to increase the security of payment systems, then maybe we wouldn't have the absurdly insecure systems that we have now. Inter-bank ACH is fundamentally an honor system. Credit/debit networks are basically a shared secret between you and everyone you've ever spent money with.<p>I'm not saying merchants should be immune from all chargebacks.

What's your point?<p>A real UX person will be able to and should provide high-fidelity mocks of the entire flow, preferably with an interactive demo of some kind. They will certainly have design skills and preferably programming skills. However, those high-fidelity mocks are the <i>last stage</i> in the UX design process. If all you want are those final mocks then you are doing nothing more than asking for a new coat of paint, and what you really want is a graphic designer.<p>So, you're right, everyone on the team should be responsible for good UX, but it really helps to have someone who can slam together some mocks after the meetings, or whose job it is to come up with a completely new idea to solve our nasty onboarding flow problem. Because George, the guy who's in charge of making sure our DB doesn't implode under load? He might be able to help out with the UX, but he's already got a full-time job to do.<p>Your image of a UX person that produces no mocks, no prototypes, no designs, and just sits in meetings is a sad one. Those people should be fired, because they are not doing <i>anything</i> -- certainly not UX.",1347044634

Once all tablets are light, responsive, high resolution, reasonably powered (RAM/CPU), and have all the standard frills you're really past the point of diminishing returns IMHO. There's not much you can do with an iPad 3 you could't do with the first iPad, though it's a nicer experience. The iPad 6 is probably going to be much less of a leap from the iPad 3 than the 3 was from the original.",1347044606

4490636,comment,4489442,4490234,11,0,tsahyt,,,"I completely agree with you. When I'm not hacking, I'm a musician. I'm currently beginning work on an album and thought about putting it under a free license. However, this album will roughly be half a year of full-time work (yes, that kind of work can be horribly time consuming), since I'm doing everything myself, from start to finish. This is why I plan on selling it, most likely on a donation basis. The free license doesn't keep me from doing so while still providing all the niceties of copyleft licenses.<p>There's just one thing: I don't want others to profit from my work. Listeners can get the album from wherever they want, do whatever they want to it or with it, I don't care. I suspect that if they like it, they'll drop me some form of donation and if they can't afford it, I'm also happy with a simple ""thank you"". But I definitely don't want my works to end up as cash in someone elses pocket, so that's why would be choosing a CC-NC license. If that goes away, I'll have to come up with my own license, or just use a non-copyleft license, whatever is easier and cheaper for me.<p>Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for sharing. Music is <i>meant</i> to be shared. That's why I want to <i>encourage</i> people to give it to their friends, hence the free license.<p>There are quite a few similar use cases for a NC license, so we should rather look into the issue of where ""commercial"" starts, rather than removing the NC license and losing potential free works.<p>I hope that makes any sense at all.",1347044587

There was no HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks, etc. And you could have a complete, functioning program with GUI from the start.<p>Now, to create a web app, you have to learn all those other things <i>in addition</i> to Ruby, or Python, or PHP. As you advance in skills you'll likely move to either front-end or back-end, but when you start out creating everything from scratch, it feels like there's so much more.<p>(This coming from someone who did IT work for the 10 years following college, and is not trying to break into the web developing world).",1347044559

As someone diagnosed with ADHD who has tried numerous medications (Adderall regular and XR, Vyvanse, Strattera, Focalin, and Wellbutrin) I have to say I would never ever <i>EVER</i> allow a young child of mine to take any of them. I can't even fathom how confusing and damaging the side effects of these medications could be to the fragile psyche of a child -- anxiety, mood swings, depression, sleep loss, etc. I was diagnosed at the age of 23, so I knew my own personality well enough to tell when it was being altered by the medications, but how would a child know this? The answer is simple: they wouldn't, and in many cases they're prescribed <i>additional</i> medications (usually anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety pills) to deal with it.<p>I cannot respect any parent who allows their minor child to take these types of psychotropic drugs in any but the most dire of situations. Reading ADHD forums was an absolutely horrifying experience for me: parents list the <i>multiple</i> drugs their children are taking in their signatures as if they're badges of honor.<p>After 2.5 years of trying various ADHD medications I gave up on them completely and have never looked back. Yes, most of them did have the benefits they promised, but the types of side effects they're capable of producing can absolutely wreak havoc on your emotional well being even in their most mild forms.",1327863096

Let's see if I have this straight:<p>The long and short of the article is that everyone's scared of Amazon, because Amazon is actually selling what consumers want, and are leveraging their consumer power to cut out the publishers completely. This has the appearance of a big win for consumers and for writers, but the publishers worry that they can't ""mold talent"" any more, and have finally realized that the middleman loses when he forgets to provide what people want. It's a complete play-by-play of the Kill Hollywood models we've been talking about recently.<p>NYT paints the publishers as a poor industry who are getting swirlies from the school bully, so they really hope that Barnes & Noble will save them. As always with the cartels, they want to hold on to the past and their print books (even when <i>they</i> that put the ridiculous, onerous DRM on their e-books and people are still buying them). What they won't do is acknowledge that Amazon has changed the game on them, and fight Amazon toe-to-toe: ie. actually merge with Barnes and Noble. They want a proxy battle, and if B&N eats it, then they don't lose anything.<p>Personal prediction: without a merger with one or two publishing companies, B&N as we know it dies within 5 years. Renting that floor space and paying those employees is just too much overhead. The last play will be to shutter their big stores, and cut themselves right down to small boutique stores on highly foot-trafficked areas, that focus entirely on pushing Nooks and eBooks.",1327861980

Think about it, you can spend 2 months building a typical CRUD app, make money the first week and keep your investors happy.

You could easily miss the premiere of a new season if you weren't paying close attention.<p>US shows are thrown on the air mostly as filler, with some rare exceptions they are not the big moneymakers for non-US stations. Although not as carelessly as in the days before DVD box sets and mass piracy, when a episodes could be shown in the wrong order, series just disappear from the schedule unannounced for months, or stay on the shelve for years.<p>But they will still happily announce a series as ""the new hit series from the US"", knowing full well that the show has already been cancelled and they only have the 13 episodes to air... This is also largely because US shows are sold as package deals. If you want to buy House for your local market, you also have to buy the rights to crappy series you know nobody will watch, at least not on <i>your</i> station. So even if there is a potential audience for those series, they will barely get a chance to watch the series, since it will be programmed at some ungodly hour.<p>The Dutch broadcasters managed to ruin many shows like for instance Six Feet Under or Battlestar Galactica that way. Yeah, lots of people still saw them, but either pirated or on DVD. Following them on television was near impossible.<p>It's a business-model that prefers to destroy a popular product in order to maintain an artificial scarcity rather than to sell it directly to the consumers at reasonable price.<p>Maintaining this model ensures Hulu is <i>never</i> going to be available outside the US, unless the whole local broadcast market completely collapses.<p>Because there is more money to be made in ensuring that a show does <i>not</i> reach its audience.

From what I've seen, bringing a project in 'on time' is about risk management.  The primary leverage point is actively slicing off the unnecessary parts of the time sinks, as they appear.   The way to get a jump start on that activity is to get risk estimates along with the time assessment.<p>Often the primary issue is fitting a goal that is in flux into time period that is not in flux.",1327860165

As a kid, we used to snort Dexedrin and Ritalin and it's called the poor man's coke. You even get a heavier crash than bad coke. The same thing is happening with prescribed opiates. More people are taking them for other reasons than for the ones they were intended for. I already know that comment is going to go at the bottom of the page since I'm talking about experience and not scientific studies,but, it's my own experiments and empirical evidence.",1327860163

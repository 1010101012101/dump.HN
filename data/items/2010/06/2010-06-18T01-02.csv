1441067,comment,1438977,1440187,0,0,zedshaw,,,"Well, this is only the beginning.  Right now it proxies, and that was one week or so of work.  Next it will really pick up web server features: routing, configuration, serving files, etc.<p>That's why ""Self-Hosting"" was in quotes.  It's self-hosting in that I can serve the chat demo up and that proves out the design.  That was my goal for this week.<p>Now, yes, your web server can take one HTTP request and hand it to one backend.  Applause all around, it is ""language agnostic"".  Oh, well after you write an HTTP server in every language.  Oh, and for only one request.  Oh, and to only one backend.  Oh, and the response can go to only one frontend server.  Oh, and except that every web server thinks everything is a ""file"".  Oh, and then there's that nasty config you dare not change.  Oh, and when you want to add another 100 backends you gotta change every frontend to be aware of them.<p>And so on.  The revolutionary part is with Mongrel2 I'm trying to break the 1:1 mapping of REQUEST:RESPONSE so that you can have N:N mapping easily, and that backends can be simple 0mq handlers of JSON and in any language.  You can have N requests map to arbitrarily any N backends and they can respond to any N frontends asynchronously.<p>That's how the chat demo works right now.  I get a request, and then the <i>backend</i> replies to the front end to deliver messages to all connected browsers.  I could even start up 10 backends without changing one thing in the front end.  Try that with current web servers without tons of hacks.<p>Another way to put this, and much more simply, is that right now web servers need to know every little thing about your backend architecture, and they force you to cram it into the concept of ""files at URLs"".  Mongrel2 will not care what your backend is as long as it responds, and it won't constrain to everything being a cohesive file or even HTTP.",1276826342

The text referred to—""functional programming finally became truly convenient and practical with the introduction of Mathematica's symbolic language""—may be an exaggeration, but it's not meant as a slap at Lisp. And the fact that so many academics use Mathematica on a daily basis, that they sell expensive licenses for their software so widely, suggests that there's a lot of truth to the claim.",1276826286
1441064,comment,1440220,1440677,0,0,strlen,,,"> Google has, what, 20,000 engineers? That's a LOT of effort for what they have to show for it.<p>That criticism would hold true if Google were a pure product company. Salesforce is a great example of this: in their SIGMOD/SoCC keynote they've mentioned they only employ 200 engineers. They don't face the sort of scalability and algorithmic challenges that warrants developing custom infrastructure: they use of the shelf commercial products and open source products (Oracle RAC, Lucene).<p>At Google that great deal of work goes into amazing internal infrastructure that is rarely read about (I'd imagine the published papers are only the tip of an iceberg) i.e., people hacking on the kernel, on file systems, on databases, firmware etc... This infrastructure is their competitive advantage and their moat. At Salesforce, their ability to out execute competitors (via aggressive selling and marketing) on an innovative but not inventive business model.<p>In the case of Google, being a major contributor to the Linux kernel, they're effectively their own operating systems vendor. With BigTable, MegaStore, Spanner, their MySQL patches and more, they're their own database vendor. With Chubby, GFS, MapReduce, their own web server, etc... they're their own distributed middleware company. They're also one of the largest hardware manufactures, with themselves as their only consumer.<p>In terms of their core competencies (search/IR/ML), they're an incredible research organization. Not all research results in products, but they've been able to productize their research much more effectively than Microsoft has (perhaps at the cost of having a less theory and more systems focused research organization i.e., employing Rob Pike but <i>not</i> Leslie Lamport).<p>I have a feeling it's great to be a researcher or an advanced developer (working on infrastructure or algorithms) at Google: you have the capability to focus on actually <i>building</i> incredible pieces of software. In terms of application development, it might be slightly less appealing (although, I've been extremely impressed with Android, Chrome and Gmail as _finished products_ too).<p>Of course, if someone's _primary_ goal out of a job is to become an enterpreuner and found their own company, going to Google may not be the best place for this (other than for making connections and gaining credibility much like going to Stanford): building an infrastructure start-up is much more difficult than building a web application start-up. For those who are first and foremost technologists (that would be me), Google still symbolizes the ""ideal"" job: perform incredibly advanced development (implicitly frowned upon in most product companies) <i>and</i> build practical, working software that gets put to production use (implicitly frowned upon in research centers and academia). At one point one such place was AT&T Bell Labs, at a later point it was Sun. Now that place is Google.",1276826259

Hackers?  I don't think so.  MacHeads, probably.).<p>Of course Gruber isn't going to say, ""I think Apple is the best even when they're not.""  He couches his fanaticism in ""good taste"".  And it just so happens that everything Apple does has good taste, and everything anyone else does, does not.  Unless they subsequently get bought by Apple.<p>I don't know if Gruber has been duped, but when I see someone who believes a single company is universally good and their competitors universally bad, I get suspicious.  Of course taste is taste.  Someone might say that Coby is the pinnacle of consumer gadgets.  No one makes better quality than Coby.  You'd immediately flip the bozo bit on them, although maybe you'd be inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt.<p>I just find so little that Gruber says has any objective truth in it, which is why it is hard for me to respect him.<p>And lets be clear.  On my personal blog, I can easily find a lot of really good products from a variety of places.  I don't think Gruber has that capacity.  For example, could you imagine Gruber saying a positive word about an MS product.  For him a product is an MS product above everything else.  Quality of the product is a secondary aspect of it.  This is why Apple products all get passes.  Their first Apple products, and then their quality comes next.  And then he justifies the quality of Apple products.<p>""I also think that in the paragraph you quoted earlier from Gruber, he was assuming that the Android and iPhone fans are fans because they identify with statements like the two he provided, rather than that they would identify with those statements because of their status as iPhone or Android fans.""<p>What does being a fan have to do with having an opinion?  Again, his polarization of the world through his lens makes him susceptible to this form of thinking (whether using my or your interpretation).<p>At the end of the day Gruber is simply not informative, and its due to his fanatical fanboyism.  I can pretty much write a Gruber post.  I'll take a current Apple controversy.  I'll tell you why Apple is right/better, and the competitor is worse.  I'll take liberties with logic or common sense, but I'll drop nuggets of insider knowledge (and those are actually useful, and keep his blog from being a total waste).<p>But then again, I'm sure he's making a lot more money with his blog than I am with this random posting on HN.",1276824331

But that's the thing. The interview was still not over. They were still in the phase that is akin to asking him questions. They wanted to see how well his algorithm would work on live data. I guess a better analogy would be if the interviewer asked the interviewee a question and then started talking on the phone rather than pay attention for the interviewee's answer.<p>Or if you want to take the analogy to ""waiting for a reply after the interview,"" then this is more like Apple stalling on making a decision on hiring him. They've interviewed him, and he pings them every week, but a couple of months later they still claim to have made no decision while continuously claiming that a decision is right around the corner and/or just needs <i>one more person's</i> approval/review.",1276824309

If the other scouts really <i>are</i> interested in making it to Eagle Scout then they will remain focused enough to get there.

1440973,comment,1440671,1440820,0,0,koffie,,,"I doubt Apple ""waits"", they prefer to limit them-self to a focussed feature set ""done right"". Apparently - the entire iPhone 1st gen was designed and developed by a very very small team. This helps consistency, and avoids having some parts of the team not knowing what another part is doing. If they then - like they did for the iPhone - start with a clean API and environment with future expandability in mind, you start out with a solid architecture on which they can build. The downside however is that the initial product has a very  small/basic feature-set. Upside is, its core features are (mostly) ""done right"" and behave consistently. A ton of features, which the competition already has, are missing, but nobody uses them there because of complexity or weird behavior.<p>Copy-paste is actually a perfect example here. I have had many smartphones and PDAs (iPaq, Nokia communicator, Sony-Ericsson P910, P990 and a few others) - and in none of them I actually ever used the copy-paste (if it was there), or at least certainly not as much as I do now on my iPhone. Worst clipboard implementation I've ever seen was that when I copied text in a one application, apparently it was placed on the clipboard as UTF8 or Ansi text. No problem so far - but apparently, if your target app then only accepted ascii text - too bad, no copy-paste. Try explaining that-one to a normal user, good luck... I then prefer the focussed on core-features, ""no clipboard"" approach instead of a confusing, non-working or unreliable feature you end up not using at all.<p>Now I'm not an Apple fanboy, but I do have an iPhone (only Apple product I own). I'll be the last to say that it's perfect and everything is entirely ""done right"", but from what I've seen - from a user-point of view - it's without a doubt the best thing out-there. Yes there are on paper ""better phones"" with ""more features"" which are ""more open"", but whatever, it just works. On PC I might be considered a power-user, but my phone is a vital part of my life. I don't want to mess around on it too much - it has to simply work. I did consider buying an Android phone for the sole purpose of playing with it, but I simply don't have the time for that at the moment. I might still do this in the future, after having played with 1.5, 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2 on various models of friends - I have to say, I'm impressed by the technical improvements, but still - the user-experience is just horrible. There are some cool ideas, like the notifications - but the execution is mind-blowing irritating after a while.

I mean, look at the pundits all complaining that the new iPhone 5 is boring, why can't Apple reinvent the mobile world every 2 years?   Because they're having a hell of a time incrementally improving the current world, which isn't anywhere near perfect!  There doesn't seems to be much excitement in ""getting things perfectly right"", it's about finding the sweet spot of ""mostly right"".   This tends to cater to consumers and not geeks or power users with edge cases.<p>I don't get upset about today's software because it's much better than what we had before (even iTunes).   I remember the 90s where my computer would lock up twice daily with a blue screen.   Where my data would get corrupted regularly.   Where I had to reinstall my OS bi-annually to deal with slow downs.  I haven't had to experience these things in nearly 8 to 10 years.

For one thing, it's not a Halting Oracle, it's actually an ""oracle"" that tells you if you have an unspecified bug. The ""oracle"" doesn't answer ""trivial"" questions, for an unspecified definition of trivial. In reality, the ""oracle"" just uses heuristics to determine if the program is complex enough, that any experienced developer would tell you that there's probably a bug somewhere. The ""oracle"" will only answer questions about systems that are really Production systems.

4535515,comment,4534408,4535191,5,0,adgar,,,"You might be wondering why people think that. Here's why: it's the <i>entire point of CoffeeScript</i>. According to the first two intro grafs at coffeescript.org:<p>> CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath all those awkward braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.<p>> The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: ""It's just JavaScript"". The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.",1347926046

I believe the popular one is Hoeffding's inequality in the bandit literature, hence the log term in the MAB algorithms. I agree this was a poor choice of example.<p>Second, I believe I am getting hung up on the fact that different arrival times are ""weighted"" differently. I think you are claiming that the Poisson assumption gives us equal numbers of A and B trials, so we can combined the statistics (counts) and avoid Simpson's paradox. This is fine, but why would you say ""different times of arrival are not weighted the same"". Does this mean you are somehow weighting periods of heavy traffic down and weighting low traffic up?<p>So, what happens when trial A becomes less favorable over time or is less favorable for brief periods? This means that the underlying random variable's mean is changing over time. Most statistical bounds cannot handle this situation.<p>I am not saying that A/B testing is not something we should do in general.

4535437,comment,4532904,4534253,1,0,geebee,,,"I definitely agree that competitiveness has something to do with it, but I think you could have a highly competitive culture without as much cheating.  I think it's the ""winner take all"" mentality along with ""gateway by proxy"" that creates such a toxic environment.<p>For instance, we decide who will become a physician largely by grades and MCAT scores.  Many people who would have been good physicians will not be accepted to med school, and people who get into top schools are better positioned.  Med school is hard, but the vast majority who get in make it through, so ""getting in"" is the most important thing.  Unfortunately, we won't be deciding who will be a physician by seeing who is best at being a physician, it doesn't work that way.  Instead, we use a GPA and exam as a stand in.  This system can be malevolently cracked, with huge payoffs for the people who aren't caught, and potentially life altering consequences for those who don't cheat and fall short (I know a guy who was borderline and didn't get into med school - after two tries, he gave up on being a doctor).<p>Compare this with being a programmer.  I'm not saying there's no cheating in CS classes, I'm sure there's plenty.  But if you really want to be a programmer, there isn't a magic proxy that you can crack.  And if you're at the 49%ile, it's not like you don't get to be a programmer the way some people don't get to become physicians.<p>But imagine if decided that every year, 50,000 people were allowed to study to become ""programmers"" (with fines and imprisonment for those who programmed without this credential), and we chose them them all based on a logic test that correlates pretty damn well with programming ability.  Now I think you'd see really horrendous amounts of cheating.  It isn't just the competitiveness, it's the added reliance on a crackable proxy.<p>Character matters, but we should also see widespread cheating as perhaps a sign of a deeply flawed system - and if it's clear that we can't stop the cheating, we should understand that the system is profoundly unfair to honest people who accept the results.  If cheating on a single exam can make such a difference, and it's clear that we are unable to control the cheating, then maybe we should try to be less reliant on a single, mass produced exam.<p>One of my math professors in college said he figured he could assess a student's knowledge of an area of math after an hour of discussion.  No ""mass produced"" exam needed, just take it where it goes, probe a bit, allow the student to consult the books of ask for a reminder if needed.  It would be nearly impossible to cheat on such an exam.<p>I understand (and so did the professor) that this is idealistic - it wouldn't be the same for everybody, it wouldn't scale, and so forth.  But it's still a direction some of these struggling institutions might want to investigate.",1347924538

""Dear customers: Thanks for your business, we being acquired and we can retire now.  Internet Ad Sales, Inc. will handle all your further needs.  See ya!""<p>I do not see this as ""self-entitlement"" in some negative sense.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It's just how business works.<p>However, customers have a reason to lament if they lose the utility of a product they like.  To accuse them of ""self-entitlement"" for lamenting that loss does not make any more sense than accusing the business owners of ""self-entitlement"" for selling their business in order to enjoy a windfall.<p>If you are like this company, then you cannot make a ""grand exit"" without customers to get you to that point where someone acquires you.  You needed those customers.  They are ""entitled"" to what they've paid for the product/services and nothing more.  But if you treat customers poorly you might find they leave you for a competitor.  So, some companies may also believe that customers are ""entitled"" to respect, even though the company is under no obligation to show it.

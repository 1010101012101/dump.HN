1679029,comment,1677645,1678522,0,0,jeromec,,,"<i>But at the end of the day, it, just like horoscopes, is preying on the stupid.</i><p>Okay, I take issue with that. It actually pisses me off. Unlike horoscopes you are not led to think you'll receive something which is not actually delivered. This is a legitimate product which delivers fully on what is sold. Enjoying a positive, potentially humorous daily event does not make people like ""Holly"" or ""Logan"" from the sample phone calls ""stupid"". In fact, I myself have considered signing up for it. I just haven't went through with it. Not many would think I'm stupid.<p>I actually had an idea somewhat similar to this. It was to send a randomly timed, positive email out to a list of participants. The email wasn't to say the participant was awesome; it was just to say <i>something</i> positive, as opposed to being work related email, or spam messages sitting in their inbox, just something to brighten their day. I never figured out what content to put in the email, but I now bequeath that idea to AwesomenessReminders to add to their service as they see fit, because their version and implementation of positive messages is really good (and obviously selling).<p>True entrepreneurs know the value of motivation and encouragement. Success usually doesn't come overnight, and because entrepreneurship is a road less traveled it can be an emotionally lonely one, even with loving friends and family, because they don't really appreciate, or understand what you're trying to do. This is why tricks like posting up motivational quotes, or pictures of nice things to buy often help entrepreneurs keep slugging away. It can be tough to manufacture the consistent optimism and positive energy needed to continue down a road of setbacks, disappointments, and obstacles which can drag on for months and years. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only converted or transferred. If you believe this fundamental law of science then you might possibly see the value of receiving a positive, energetic message, in a world where positivity in general is quite scarce (just turn on the news). There is nothing stupid about this; in fact, it makes perfect sense. Besides, it's lighthearted and fun.",1284130780

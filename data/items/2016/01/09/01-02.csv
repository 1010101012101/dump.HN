10869699,comment,10869046,10869559,0,0,mschultheiss,,,"1. The web crypto api was indeed made to secure communications, such as stated by the W3C on <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/</a>\n(...) &quot;Uses for this API range from user or service authentication, document or code signing, and the confidentiality and integrity of communications. &quot;<p>2. Yes, you are definetly right, an detailed audit of the protocol is necessary by more than one expert.<p>3. Here is a short description of the basic concept:\nClient and server are seperated. The client software is basically what is hosted on Github.\nIts source code must be protected from MITM attacks of course, so it is best to ship it as standalone, downloadable application in the final release. THE CLIENT CODE WILL NOT BE OFFERED BY A SERVER IN A PRODUCTION VERSION.<p>So at sign up, the client software now generates a (RSA) public key pair and some symmetric keys used for (AES) encryption and integrity protection locally and encrypts it with a passphrase. The passphrase is only known by the user, but not by the server. The encrypted string is also integrity protected. It is sent to the server, stored there, and decrypted with the passphrase at login again. This way we ensure only the client software can see secrets, such as the private key, but not the server software.<p>Next, you have a key directory. It is signed after every modification with a secret salt which was generated by the client (and not known by the server) at signup. The keydirectory  contains all the verified public keys of the user. (Protecting it from replay attacks would be worth another essay here)\nNow when you write messages for example, you get the public key from this directory and encrypt/sign it basically like in PGP. So the focus of this preview is not on the crypto primitives, but rather on the concept itself.<p>Edit: I hope this does not sound too unfriendly, I am very happy about your feedback and I promise I will look for further advice regarding the crypto/protocol ;)",1452304746

The specific project of formalizing mathematics within itself is unachievable. That doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ve stopped doing math.<p>And this is in fact the approach modern mathematics has taken. The fact that one particular book (the proof of mathematics&#x27; own consistency) can&#x27;t be found on the shelves doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t value in keeping the rest of the books well-organized.<p>> Yes, true, but for the reason that we have no such confidence (and can have no such confidence). We cannot make that assumption, because the Turing Halting problem and its theoretical basis prevents it.<p>No! Humans aren&#x27;t developed in either Coq or ML. A human can look at Coq and say &quot;Yes, this is correct&quot; or &quot;No, this is wrong&quot; just fine, without running afoul of the halting problem, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, or anything else. The fact that you can have no <i>Coq-proven</i> confidence in Coq&#x27;s correctness does not mean that you can have no confidence of Coq&#x27;s correctness.<p>(Of course, this brings up whether a human should be confident in their own judgments, but that&#x27;s a completely unavoidable problem and rapidly moving to the realm of philosophy. If you are arguing that a human should not believe anything they can convince themselves of, well, okay, but I&#x27;m not sure how you plan to live life.)<p>This is like claiming that, because ZF isn&#x27;t provably correct in ZF (which was what Russell, Whitehead, Gödel, etc. were concerned about -- not software engineering), mathematicians have no business claiming they proved anything. Of course they&#x27;ve proven things just fine if they&#x27;re able to convince other human mathematicians that they&#x27;ve proven things.",1452304550

This type of empathy requires a subconscious background thread to be keeping track of signals which may or may not exist in the external reality. If it is at all possible to know (whether or not such signals exist), it would appear to at least require some communication. Otherwise you are just trying to make inferences off of what you observe, which is probably a near insignificant amount of what the person you are supposedly empathizing with has observed (leaving the question: How do you actually know that the things you are feeling are <i>actually</i>, <i>exactly</i> the same as what the other person is feeling?).

I have a complete record of dates and amounts of every sum I&#x27;ve put into retirement. I&#x27;m able to &quot;pretend&quot; I bought the S&P-500 (VFINX) on those dates (rather than the investing choices I actually made), and am able to calculate an APY from that date until today. (I do this by looking up dividend-adjusted historical prices.)<p>Given that, my all-time APY would have been 6.69%.  Meanwhile, using an S&P 500 Return Calculator [1], the Annualized Inflation Adjusted Reinvested Dividend performance is 6.67%.  So, almost exactly the same - maybe dollar cost averaging isn&#x27;t a crock, but in my case, not the advantage it is usually purported to be.  And this is a 20-year period that has been reasonably strong.<p>I believe the reason this happens is that people (me included) will tend to have more money to invest when times are good (and prices are high), and less to invest when times are bad (and prices are low) - so this basically eliminates any dollar-cost-averaging advantage.  I&#x27;m just one data point so I might be an unlucky outlier, but the theory makes sense to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator/</a>",1452304015

Clearly they have both the ability to detect when a user is streaming video, regardless of source, and the network capacity to support unlimited streaming at 1.5 mbps - so this should be technically feasible. Zero-rating all detected video traffic would keep them from getting tangled up in thorny net neutrality issues and would keep the likes of the FCC, EFF, and Google off their backs.",1452302452

This interpenetration does pose a problem with time reversibility, as if you run time backwards, then forwards again, it is not guaranteed that you will arrive in the same state after collapse.<p>A more modern interpenetration is Many Worlds. In this interpenetration, there is no collapse. So when we observe the cat, the universe is in a superposition of us having observed a dead cat, and us having observed a living cat. When we run time backwards, we end up at the point where we put the cat into the box, as you would expect. If we run time forwards again, we arrive at the same superposition of observing a living cat, and observing a dead cat.<p>Without looking at the math, the ability to go from a superimposed state to a pure state may seem like it presents an asymmetry, but the equations allow (and we have experimentally done) this in forward time already.

You still write code in C-like Wiring, but they have built-in APIs for storing data in the cloud and calling webhooks. It&#x27;s not <i>as</i> simple as interacting with web apis from JS, and the fact that it relies on their cloud service would make me hesitate to use it in a commercial product. But for my home play projects, it provides a really nice balance of using C for the hardware stuff without making the networking stuff a major pain.",1452301392

Nah.<p>Moving an object to higher gravitational potential decreases the entropy of the system (and thus requires work, unsurprisingly).<p>Mixing oil into water means you displace some volume of  water which were closer to Earth with oil bubbles (which are lighter than equivalent volume of water) while you force the displaced water volume higher/further from Earth. Thus by mixing lighter oil with heavier water you decrease the entropy of the gravitational system consisting of the oil, water and Earth. Left to its own devices, the system evolves along the entropy increasing gradient - heavy water goes down displacing lighter oil up, thus decreasing the gravitational potential of the system (the friction during that &quot;unmixing&quot; is the work of the gravitational force that ultimately results in the heat that is lost away into the  environment).",1452301324

Perhaps you&#x27;ve underestimated the literally astronomical distances involved, and how much power is required to get there in anything close to a reasonable time-frame. It would be required to accelerate at full speed for centuries, then turn around and decelerate for centuries more.  It&#x27;s easy to imagine that taking enough nuclear material to be able to cause a non-negligible nuclear disaster on a scale that meets or exceeds past nuclear disasters.

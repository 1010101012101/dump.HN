A million dollars barely buys you an MRI machine - which would cost the same no matter where you are since it is an international market. A million dollars doesn't build a building, even if you think Mexico is cheaper, it is not 1/500th of the price.<p>Preceded by ""try having .. a blog"". Yes, the father/son connection and the blog/reader connection are definitely comparable. I see your point, and will now sever family ties in favor of blogging.<p>And then you site Bill Gates - as if that is a typical startup founder. Not even sure what that has to do with anything.",1214834306

You can still cry while you are at the Disney Land.<p>All those studies failed to recognize that the state of happiness is not something infinite. And how can you understand and appreciate the happiness if you have never taste the wrath of sadness?<p>Yes, the studies show us the correlation between having kids and less happiness in people. But remember, correlation does not imply causation.",1214834215
231974,comment,231642,231928,0,0,sofal,,,"You'd have to provide some great incentives to balance the 25% lower salary. Free time is nice, but it's also free. If I value free time over a large paycheck to the extent that I'd be willing to give up that much salary, I'm basically just looking for a part time job. It sounds like the only difference is that you're allowed to use company resources for a side project. Is that enough?<p>I'm uncomfortable with the idea that not paying employees what they're worth will have a net benefit. You should pay your employees well in whatever ways you can reasonably do it (money, benefits, stake in the company, perks, even softer things like respect, trust, etc.) Compensating them with free time doesn't make any sense. They have just as much time as you do, and it's theirs to spend.",1214833963
231973,comment,231836,231966,0,0,swombat,,,"Well, as an example of how you might go about doing that, I remember reading an article about a study that found that bad teachers don't get better with time, but they tend to cling on anyway because they get significantly more money each year.<p>One of the suggestions from that article was that to improve teaching quality, it might be worth offering a flat (higher than the current 1st-year and lower than the current 10th-year) salary to encourage people to try teaching for a couple of years after uni (since the salary would then be decent right away). This would also discourage people from clinging on to the job unless they really like it.<p>This is certainly not a solution that teachers' unions would advocate, but I suspect it could produce some positive effects, assuming the study I mentioned was correct, and assuming part of the problem is indeed the fact that many people who could be great teachers don't bother because they pay is very bad at the beginning and they can go and be bankers instead.<p>Of course I'm not an expert on this, so my theories may be wide off the mark, but I don't accept the idea that the pool of existing teachers can't be improved. I suspect that one of the reasons why private schools are indeed better than public schools is precisely that they can afford better teachers.<p>As for teachers' unions... I have little respect for a professional organisation that works against its own professional aim. I'm sure they can be taken care of in some way or another.",1214833958

In particular, going through that list it struck me that those points covered pretty most of the reasons I had for leaving online communities of one sort or the other. I'm not referring to just Web 2.0 environments like Digg or Reddit but rather to just about any online group of 3 or more people.

No shit, Forbes magazine said that. It was then that I realized the elite would gladly sell my organs on a penny profit.<p>At any rate, expect a steady flow of paid-for brides moving into China.

There are complex details like exception handling (stack unwinding, signals...), graphical debuggers, interface with GUI libraries, threads, etc.<p>The fact that only commercial (and expensive) Lisp implementations have all these features is a hint that they're not trivial.",1214833474
231966,comment,231836,231865,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"It's not obvious to me that improving teacher quality is possible. Is there really a large enough pool of people out there who would be good teachers, but choose not to teach?<p>I know it's a popular talking point by teachers unions angling for more money, but I don't think it's really a solution.<p>Improving the process also matters, and we even know how to do it (Direct Instruction). It is effective even when used by low quality teachers. Unfortunately, it's also dead in the water since teachers unions don't like it.<p><a href=""http://www.projectpro.com/ICR/Research/DI/Summary.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.projectpro.com/ICR/Research/DI/Summary.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/honestft.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/honestft.htm</a>",1214833286

I like to do everything I can in all aspects of my life to try and leave as small of a footprint as I can.  I have never owned a car, I became a vegetarian for its environmental (not animal rights bullshit) reasons (10 pounds of grain or a pound of beef?), and leave the furnace off for a good part of the winters even though I am Canadian.<p>I'm not wanting some company to hold my hand and make mne feel like I'm making a difference, because I know I am.  I'm saying I want a company that cares as much as I do.  I want one that does power its servers off of 100% renewable resources. and not to say to my customers ""LOOK!  I CARE!"".<p>I understand the best I'm going to get it someone purchasing offset credits, but that's better than nothing.

231963,comment,231642,231926,0,0,swombat,,,"Ok.<p>Well, I'm not trying to put you down, but your thoughts on this subject are pretty worthless until you can put them in practice. ""How to structure a workplace"" is one of those extremely complex topics that require many years of practical experience to get right, and that present countless options that look alright at first glance but turn out to be disastrous.<p>This is very similar to the problem of scaling applications to millions of users. Would you take advice about that from someone who hasn't actually gone and scaled at least one, but ideally several applications to that kind of scale? No, because even though their theoretical solution might sound alright, it has no substantiation to confirm that it actually has a snowflake's chance in hell to work out in real life.<p>The problem with your article is that it is just day-dreaming, but you present it as if it was some sort of tested solution. In fact, it <i>is</i> just day-dreaming, applied to a subject that many extremely bright people have been studying and working in for about a hundred years. That subject is called ""Management"", for your information. Certainly there is room for improvement, but until you actually have experience of the subject and have proven that your ideas actually work, they are effectively worthless.",1214833153

My high school years were not painful and were a lot of fun, even though I was labelled a nerd, curve-buster, einstein, etc.... So this is my advice from my experience. \nDon't try to be popular. Be friendly. Help others. Volunteer. Get Respect. Get involved in a sport. Get involved in various things with different people and you will have enough friends that being popular won't matter and no one will dare pick on you. I played soccer and later ran x-country and track, I sang, I was a scout, I was in youth fellowship, I was a mathlete and I hacked a pdp-8 in the hour between school and practice.  I certainly was not popular but I was friends or at least friendly with most of the school. People knew me and I had their respect.",1214832986

More than once, on such occasions, the New Englander had teased his Welsh-English friend for those wasted regrets. . . . Frost found something quaintly romantic in sighing over what might have been.

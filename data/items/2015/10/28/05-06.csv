Here&#x27;s just a sampling of popular methods and flags:<p>- Duplicate checking (same user on different products with similar reviews, for example)<p>- Meta-reviews (&quot;was this review helpful?&quot; - can also be gamed)<p>- user rating averages (all highs or all lows sometimes considered a flag)<p>- ratio of &quot;first product reviews&quot; to total reviews on a per-product basis<p>- &quot;Super-reviewer&quot; status (questionable, but often a flag)<p>- Products with low sales ranks<p>- Review ring detection (IP block, post times, etc.)<p>- Early reviews<p>- Users who give high ranks, while most other reviews are low<p>- Positive reviews for one brand&#x27;s products, and negative for others<p>- &quot;Verified&quot; purchases<p>A lot of these already have countermeasures, and fake reviews have already come up with counter-counter measures (like review-time staggering, using multiple IP blocks, shipping empty boxes to defeat verified purchases, etc.)<p>The &quot;how to know what&#x27;s trustworthy?&quot; is the million dollar question, and it has many answers that happen to change over time.

I compare it to the beginning of CS to now. In the 70&#x27;s a computer scientist was familiar with electronics, and a lot of very low level things that would be considered EE now. This was needed in the days where machines were bespoke, and coding was very bare metal. But then people built standardized hardware, and developed standard operating systems that allowed people to work with higher level languages and trust the low level to others.<p>This is still the case. I am familiar with assembly and X86 but I never work with it. I do not need to, there are people that work on that. That does not impair me, it is just that the world of tech has grown much larger and there is a lot to know where nobody can know it all. Some have the feeling that if you cannot work with assembly or write compilers or device drivers you somehow don&#x27;t have your chops.<p>The skills that are &quot;few and far between&quot; are those wanting to work on a unique system where that knowledge is not directly applicable to today&#x27;s less bespoke technologies.",1446009554

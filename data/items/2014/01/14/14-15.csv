A desktop environment is but one part of that - and it seems those people don&#x27;t agree that it should be the most prominent one.<p>All these words written on why the available Linux DEs suck were so far unconvincing from my point of view and I would&#x27;ve loved to see another thorough explanation. Most of the things I&#x27;ve read aren&#x27;t specific to any Linux DE and mostly &quot;I don&#x27;t want to adapt to change&quot; arguments - just like &quot;Windows 8 is the downfall of Microsoft Windows&quot; and &quot;Maverick is the worst OS X ever&quot; (or &quot;Firefox changed the default theme!!&quot;).<p>Technically I&#x27;d say that there are a number of decent DEs available, all with benefits and tradeoffs. In fact, my biggest gripe with Linux on the desktop isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s no decent DE, my pet peeve is the inconsistent looks between applications written for different DEs/in different Toolkits. Mixing GTK with QT (with motif, tk, swing, e17&#x27;s libraries and whatnot in the mix) looks bad, feels unnatural and restricts my selection of tools for a job (&quot;Am I going to install that thing? Naaah, it&#x27;s based on QT&quot;). I don&#x27;t want more DEs, I&#x27;d prefer more progress a la freedesktop / a unified path forward.<p>Obviously this is all a rather subjective thing, but Linux runs fine on my desktop for a long time already.",1389710972

7057269,comment,7056614,7057182,10,0,rayiner,,,"> So, just to play the devil&#x27;s advocate: are NPEs by definition patent trolls? I can&#x27;t think of a counterargument, but maybe someone else can?<p>There are lots of counter-examples. E.g. Mojave Aerospace Ventures (MAV): <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Aerospace_Venture"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Aerospace_Ventures</a>. It&#x27;s the patent-holding company that owns all the patents for Spaceship One. It&#x27;s a vehicle to intermediate between the major investor, Paul Allen, the inventor, Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, and the various companies that will be commercializing the technology, namely the Virgin Group and any special-purpose joint-venture entities created by it.<p>MAV (and ARM, mentioned in a sibling comment), is a great example of why NPEs exist.[1] There is a lot of value in being able to take the products of expensive R&D, like the Spaceship One effort that won the X Prize, and being able to package that into a set of property rights owned by a holding company that can transact in those rights. It allows a division of labor that&#x27;s very hard to achieve otherwise. And division of labor is a good thing, because it allows everyone to focus on their core competency.<p>For example, in the case of Mojave, you have the separation between the people doing the R&D (Scaled Composites), the people bankrolling the effort (Paul Allen and other investors), and the people doing the commercialization (Virgin, etc). In the case of ARM, you have a separation between the people doing the R&D (ARM), the people making SOCs using the basic cores (NVIDIA, TI, AMD), the people manufacturing the chips (Samsung, TSMC, GF), and the people using the chips in finished products. It&#x27;s economically valuable to facilitate this sort of separation.<p>[1] Indeed, MAV is a better example than ARM, because it&#x27;s purely a holding company. It does neither the research nor the commercialization, but rather exists to facilitate the involvement of the independent investor in the whole process.",1389710452

Also there may be a lot of code in the framework that looks strange and you&#x27;re having trouble figuring out how it works.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked with joomla myself, but I&#x27;ll try to give you a few ideas about how I would approach figuring it out if I had no clue and the documentation wasn&#x27;t helpful.<p>The steps I would take are:<p>1) Get a local test instance of your site setup.<p>2) Figure out how to insert a line of code that generates some sort of output that you can see as soon as it&#x27;s executed (ie. a &quot;print statement&quot;).  Usually this will go to some server log file. There should be something in the docs, hopefully an example, about logging.<p>3) Make a guess about what code gets executed when a page you&#x27;re interested in gets rendered.  Most likely this will be the php file that you see in that page&#x27;s URL.<p>4) Once you&#x27;ve got a first message to print out try to reason through the control flow of the code, adding print statements here and there to test your understanding of what gets executed when.<p>By following this approach you should start to get a feel for how the joomla code works and eventually you will find out where code for your new feature should go.  If you still have trouble figuring that out try to find a similar feature already implemented in joomla or some add-on or extension and see how that was implemented.<p>If you want a recommendation for an IDE I&#x27;ve found that Eclipse with the PHP plugin works pretty well, but for this process of understanding the joomla code I would just use whatever text editor you&#x27;re comfortable with, an IDE will probably only get in the way of your investigations at this point.",1389709884

NO! I did it. I learned a lot about devops, I installed Nginx, APC, PHP-FPM, REdis. \nI learned how to setup a mysql master slave replication AND how to make laravel play w/ it so that all writes go to the localhost slave, and all reads go to the maindb master.<p>I also have a redis server on the maindb server that is used for caching of  laravel. I also had to diagnose and treat a major bottleneck(load time of 12s) -- now it&#x27;s 100ms or less. (I was pulling in blog data from wordpress on every page load to integrate into the CRM -- now I cache it for 48 hours.)<p>Trust me I could never think of all these problems, but as I solve them I learn, and I figure out how to be a better developer, and even some devops skills --which can be very useful.<p>I took this job on the cheap $15/hour simply for the experience, when I finish the app to a good point as I&#x27;m the single developer, I&#x27;m planning on moving on to $40-50 an hour job, or asking for a HUGE raise. I also am working on Ruby on Rails side project in my spare time just to get some familiarity w/ that platform - the more you know.. Also I built some of the admin frontend stuff in AngularJS -- some cool filtering of orders filters as I type an email, or tracking#. So in six months I learned:<p>* How to setup, build, and deploy an enterprise laravel app.\n* How to setup an app server cluster, with a nodebalancer duplicate the content using Csync+Lsync, Secure the system using firewalls, changing ssh logins, not allowing root logins, etc.. How to speed things up by using Nginx instead of APache - and tweak the hell out of it. How to use redis as a caching engine.\n* How to use angularJS for a more dynamic front-end to my app.\n* How to solve ANY problem thrown at me.\n* How to test and diagnose problems w/ my app. (Learning to write better unit tests currently.)\n* How to manage a mysql server cluster. \n* Basic linux crap like ssh, scp, aptitude, etc...",1389709122

A thorough CS education gives you the broadest and deepest foundation on which to build your practical skills. The skills you actually learn at university will probably quickly be outdated, but that&#x27;s going to be true anyway, and a good foundation means you&#x27;ll learn new languages faster, can more quickly pick up complex concepts, and can more easily switch to different areas of development.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re happy doing just basic programming in a single language, you can probably learn that without an expensive education. People do that all the time.<p>PHP is very popular with hobby programmers, so presumably easy to learn. I have almost no experience with PHP, but even Wikipedia uses it, so it&#x27;s good enough for big stuff. There&#x27;s lots of work in it, though my impression is that rates are a lot lower than for other languages.<p>Python is also a very good starting language. Very well designed, and it has the advantage that you&#x27;re not just limited to the web. Plenty of games have also been written in Python, for example. Jobs seem to be a lot less than PHP, but that probably means that rates are better.<p>Another good option that might be worth considering is Ruby. Beautiful language, popular with hip startups, rapid development, but not great performance.<p>If you want to look more into enterprise web development (which you probably don&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m listing it for completeness sake), you have to look at Java. Popular in introductory programming courses. Started out as a nice, clean language, but has been surpassed by younger languages in that respect. There&#x27;s loads of work at very good rates here, though it&#x27;s unlikely to be the most exciting work.<p>And whatever you do, Javascript is always worth learning.<p>Get a good book, look at all the online tutorials, look at the code of popular open source projects, and start making your own thing.",1389708989

You have a general goal - to get over the burnout, understand how you fell into it, and to figure out the next direction you want to go in (right?).  Then a good therapist would draw boundaries around that - e.g. 10 sessions, then check to see how complete the goal is.  Thus you need not get drawn into years of psychoanalytical blah blah.  IF the therapist pushes you to do otherwise, then they are not the right one for you.<p>I too am conflicted on what I want to do next, and I need to understand my ambivalence - then hopefully I will get the confidence or energy needed to tackle the problem.

That doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.<p>> They put their internet life into the hands of Google or Yahoo or whatever by choosing such an email provider that may go down at any time.

This indicates to me that synapses may be more important to biological neural networks than neurons are, and yet most ANN research has been focused exclusively on neurons (I once asked my teacher which neurons to connect to each other and recommended using a GA, which is not a bad idea but it indicates to me we have a very poor understanding of how synapses aught to work to make better ANNs.)<p>I disagree with the overly pessimistic view of this article however.

The reality is that it doesn&#x27;t not work with TypeScript and one step better, the API source of truth is defined in TypeScript (and soon human readable html, I promise!)<p>Facebook&#x27;s Flow typechecker is nearing a level of completion where we can open source it, and has a similar mechanism of .d.flow files.

Also, much of the resurgence in interest in AI came about 12 years ago in large part due to Jeff&#x27;s thinking and writings (which was mostly consolidating existing ideas into a cohesive theory), as Andrew Ng and others have stated[1]. Jeff helped kick AI out of a plateau and avoid another AI winter.<p>For interesting things that Numenta has done, just check their website[2]. Their most popular product is likely Grok[3], which predicts things like server loads.

ANNs have been around quite a bit longer and have orders of magnitude more researchers working with them, so I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s premature to dismiss HTMs just because a handful of researchers in Redwood, CA haven&#x27;t solved every AI problem within 12 years.<p>It was only 15-20 years ago that ANNs were considered to have peaked and been surpassed by bayesian networks and support vector machines.

Their job (or at least their office&#x27;s job) is also to decide when and where to seek prosecution. In theory, determining truth and innocence is a significant part of their job.<p>The trouble is when that runs up against a politicized, failure intolerant culture that would much rather reward a prosecutor with a strong string of wins (however questionable their methods) over one with the courage to simply present the best case they have and let the jury decide on the facts like they are supposed to.",1414890263

If the prosecution has to stack the jury to get a conviction, it doesn&#x27;t have a proper case.<p>Another problem is that the prosecution is looking for easily influenced jurors rather than diligent ones.<p>Once had a hung jury on this where one juror was voting guilty and wouldn&#x27;t budge.  Our take: &quot;Look, yes, he is guilty of possession.  He had the drugs.  <i>BUT THAT&#x27;S NOT WHAT HE&#x27;S CHARGED WITH</i>.  He&#x27;s charged with conspiracy and he wasn&#x27;t even in the country at the time the conspiracy was supposedly discussed.  The government <i>HASN&#x27;T PROVED ITS CASE</i>.&quot;<p>Nope.  Guilty.  Won&#x27;t budge.  And she was a grand juror.  So much for the safety check of a grand jury.  Sigh.",1414890251

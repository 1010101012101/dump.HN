61988,comment,61831,61924,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm exclusively indie rock.  You're a bit softer in taste than I, but there's some overlap.  The Arcade Fire is one of the best bands playing right now.  Their live show is astoundingly good...best I've seen in years.<p>My faves are: Spoon, Midlake, Fugazi, Death from Above 1979, Voxtrot, Mission of Burma, Cat Power, The Lemonheads.<p>When I'm working I'm most productive with things that have no lyrics or illegible lyrics, but are familiar.  Jesu, The Fucking Champs, and electronica like Booka Shade and Apparat.  Embarrassingly, perhaps, I'm totally loving working to old school metal lately--some from before my time, actually, but I like it anyway--Judas Priest, in particular.  Also stuff I liked in high school and college: Carcass, Godflesh, Neurosis.<p>I made a list of my favorite tracks at emusic a while back (need to update it with Arcade Fire and a few other recent faves):<p><a href=""http://www.emusic.com/lists/showlist.html?lid=564452&p=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emusic.com/lists/showlist.html?lid=564452&p=1</a><p>You can't beat emusic if you like indie music.  It's cheap, non-DRM, and they've got nearly all of the best bands and labels.",1191311685

61983,comment,61922,61922,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I think you just saved yourself from what could have eventually been a huge headache. <p>I'm assuming since you are applying for funding from YC that you are looking to start a company (YC acceptance or not). If that is the case, you should be glad that you weeded out someone weak while it is easy and not later on down the road. This could be a valuable lesson: Choose who you work with and trust <i>very</i> carefully! <p>If this guy can get up and jet on you this easily, think what would have happened after you actually started and financial and emotional stress enters the equation?<p>My advice is go find someone who you can really trust as a co-founder. Someone you know you can depend on when the going gets tough.",1191309565

Doing it with Sass looks even better and now I want to find some time to switch over just to keep things well-organized.",1191309064

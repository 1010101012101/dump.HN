And such ""at-risk"" children often inherit genes predisposing them to exactly the kinds of issues the studies uncover (and blame on watching too much TV). The problem is that most of these studies don't control for genes; there's no way to tell if TV-watching is the source of the problems or if it's the genes of the parents who let their babies watch lots of TV. Until the studies are re-done while controlling for genes, the conclusions (and the corresponding recommendations) are useless.<p>Parents who read a lot to their children have children who grow up to be more verbal. But parents who read a lot to their children also tend to pass on genes for verbal fluency. Studies that adequately control for genes show that reading to children does virtually nothing for their verbal abilityit's all in the genes, and in random events over which the parents have no control.

If thats the case, there is nothing they can do to prove to you what they're doing is legitimate short of open sourcing their entire stack (and even then, you must trust that what they're running == the source they give you).

This is (or was) especially striking with phones where you simply couldn't buy made-for-Japan mobile phones outside Japan, and likewise you couldn't find non-Japanese phones in Japan. This is why it was such a shock that the iPhone was a success here, and the entire emerging smartphone market caught Docomo and AU completely flat-footed.<p>There is a particularly irritating component of Japanese nationalism which holds that Japanese are unique, as in physiologically unique, among the world's population (down to having different immune systems, in fact). In seems natural for a Japanese company that it would essentially have to act as two companies, one for exported products and another for domestic ones. It's very inefficient. It's also remarkably stupid as the iPhone demonstrates - what sells anywhere else will also sell here, and vice versa (I would always get comments on my phone when I went overseas and had to tell people the model was only available in Japan, to their disappointment).<p>Contrast this with most other large manufacturers where they will have more-or-less the same products globally, with some localization.<p>Actually the solution for Japan is rather obvious and I suspect many know it: stop acting as though you're an alien race crash-landed on planet Earth a thousand years ago. Start treating the global market the same as the domestic one, and Japanese the same as Korean, Swedish, Canadian, whatever.

It's not particularly novel (it's an anonymous re-mailer with phone numbers instead of email addresses).  It's not solving a problem that can't be solved many other ways already (internal school district systems, email lists, teacher blogs, written notes on the whiteboard).  One of its primary sales points (protects teachers by restricting direct contact info) is only a tiny aspect of a more general problem (inappropriate communication/contact between students/teachers).  Its primary sales point offers protection from a legal liability (possessing information that could be abused) but doesn't secure that information effectively (phone numbers aren't treated by most people as ""strictly private information"" and therefore are easily obtained from many sources).  I don't see how it will be monetized effectively as neither students nor teachers are likely to pay for it (my opinion only) and it would be difficult to offer ads given that the user interface that both parties interact with is basically a text message. Technologically, it's not exactly a hard concept to duplicate now that you've presented the idea, and therefore you have a risk of competitors without the benefit of a significant ""first to market"" advantage.  Texting is popular because it's simple.  I'm not sure how much you can enhance the service beyond hiding the number.

3128286,comment,3115438,3127466,1,0,twainer,,,"Aside from the personal attacks, you are attempting here to make an intellectual construct: product as legalized monopoly or, equally pejoratively, a deliberate fiction. \nYour construct is used to deny value to a previously physical good that no longer requires a physical medium. As you put it: But once the physical component of media became something that folks on the buy side already owned our controlled outright (i.e. disk space, bandwidth, and electricity), the fiction became unsustainable.<p>In other words, unless something is a physical product it no longer has a defensible value.<p>So - taking your point - lets agree that music isnt a physical product at all. Of course, any piece of music starts its life as an idea anyway. Lets consider music as a service - an entertainment service rendered by the artist onto anyone who chooses to listen. This is an intellectual service provided much along the same lines as a lawyer or journalist or any thought-based medium. The main inputs are only the great intangibles of time and expertise.<p>Now, your original view invalidating the value of non-physical goods demands that any thought-based products do not deserve compensation or protection in your system. After all, there value is just deliberate fiction. The legal profession, of course, is just a legalized monopoly complete with barriers to entry such as law school and the Bar Exam. Journalism - built on the back of intangibles of integrity, connections, and honesty -  is just an unsustainable fiction.<p>Lets put a bold line under it: this world-view dismisses the value of non-physical-product producing work. This sounds quite like Maoist China to me. You accuse me of peddling utterly obsolete ideas but your line of thought is gravely far from being progressive. It is actually very retrograde and, in my opinion, anti-individual.<p>Work. Time. Expertise. All intangibles. Either they have value in society and deserve recompense or they dont. Its yes or its no. To avoid a long deliberation on the difference between lawyers and artists let's make it simple: if one derives something desired from the work of others than it is worthy of recompense for, logically, all that is desired has value. The inputs truly dont matter. The medium of transference certainly doesnt.<p>From where I am standing it is your thought so far that is actually the deliberate fiction: a mental construct dissolving value. A belief that through some McGuffin-like process of digitalization  the natural rules of civil society no longer apply. These are not top-down pronouncements from a single man or a government; they are bottom-up flexible norms derived from millennia of very real human experience across thousands of cultures comprised by millions of people.<p>That for me is the ultimate irony and hubris: to think that ones simple fiction somehow displaces the truth of human society. I am all for transformation but the sad news for some people seems to be that the virtual world of the internet is but a derivative of the real world - not a replacement for it. If you want to build a better internet, build one that can re-purpose human interaction in a positive way. If you only want to consume the internet simply claim that that re-purposing has no basis for being done.<p>So which is it? I believe that artists deserve at least a period of recompense for their works. What do you believe?",1318990449

3128260,comment,3127697,3127697,11,0,kstenerud,,,"The article kind of misses the point.<p>The reason why people are leaving the Japanese phones for the iPhone is because Japanese phone interfaces SUCK BALLS. And they have ALWAYS sucked. I suffered through 5 years of one phone after another being such a terrible user experience that I think it scarred me for life. And don't even get me started with Sony, who replaced the perfectly functioning joypad in their phones (which USED to be the best) with that stupid ""sony"" sidewheel they spent so much money developing and insisted on putting in every product, whether it made sense or not.<p>The fact remains, emoji ARE important. Easy text input IS important. Being able to pay for stuff at the combini with your phone IS important. It's just that having apps, and a UI that doesn't suck balls is even more important.<p>iPhone took YEARS to penetrate the Japanese market, precisely because it didn't have the features that customers wanted, and they spoke with their wallets, buying the Japanese models. But now that app and smartphone fever has finally landed, people are more willing to compromise.<p>But the point is, they SHOULDN'T have to compromise. That's just Apple deciding what people will use, even if it's the wrong thing. It's taking a little bit of good advice to such an extreme that what appears on the surface ""visionary"" would upon closer inspection reveal itself as insanity. Hubris has a way of creeping up on you when your power remains unchecked for too long.<p>Yeah, Sony used to be good, but then again they used to make good products. Once their arrogance got the better of them, their products started to suffer. My first Vaio was awesome. Sleek, light, and fast. My last Vaio was practically useless out of the box. It took me 3 HOURS to remove all the crapware they loaded into it, which slowed it down so badly that it was almost unusable. Oh, and it had that stupid useless Sony sidewheel on it, and their incompatible-because-we-said-so memory stick port too. I shudder to think of how the average user would endure with such a monstrosity.",1318989947

Currently, my major is History, though I've taken enough classes that I could get a CS minor and graduate on time. To complete a CS major, it would be another full semester, jam-packed schedules for the rest of my time in college, and probably multiple courses over the summer.<p>Complicating the matter is that I've received a job offer to work as a web developer doing exactly what I want to do, at a place I could see myself working for 5+ years or more, with a really great team, in the location I want to live, and at a salary that is more than competitive for the area. It is the same place I interned with last summer, I know them well, and it's probably the only place I really, really want to work.<p>Problem is that it starts after I am <i>supposed</i> to graduate next May. I do not know for sure if the job will still be waiting for me--they're essentially waiting for me for this entire year, and I don't feel good about adding 8 months on to the time when I can accept the job. Cost of classes/living expenses isn't a factor--thankfully, my parents saved too much for college, and have extra money lying around for this very purpose.<p>So, here is the question: does the eventual payout of a major in CS rather than a minor in CS outweigh the potential cost of not getting this job offer?",1318989686

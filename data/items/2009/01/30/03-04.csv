457659,comment,456270,456774,0,0,Retric,,,"I would like to point out that it is a novel solution because it uses what works well from a robot standpoint and what works well from a human one. The robots do the sorting, moving heavy things etc.  The humans take the huge assortment of different items and package them.  It also minimizes what changes you need to make to the warehouse so it should be a quick and cheep to retro fit.<p>While some warehouses specialize others hold 100,000+ types of items that are not in boxes ready to ship.  These items range in shapes and sizes and can be grouped to save on shipping costs etc.  Think a Ford warehouse that holds every part ever made over the last 10 years or Amazon.com not Netflix.<p>So yes, human costs are higher, but they should be  (~15 seconds a box and 20$ / hour) > 15c a package which could be far less than the savings from grouping items. And the system should be far more fault tolerant than robots moving on fixed tracks that need to pickup a wide range of box sizes vs the same shelf system every time.",1233287362

457651,comment,454218,457506,0,0,time_management,,,"Good motivations for having sex are those that are based on love. It doesn't necessarily have to be romantic love, although that's strongly preferred. A woman who hooks up with a male best friend is not a slut. This may not be advisable in all cases, but it's not dirty. Also, I don't count flings (a one-night stand is <i>not</i> a fling) against a woman, since flings usually feel like they're going to develop into real relationships to an overly optimistic mind. Naivete and optimism are fine; I'm guilty of those myself, and I've even had (non-sexual) flings before.<p>Bad motivations would be revenge (against a boyfriend or father) or manipulation. People who use sex for power instead of as an expression of love are execrable.<p>Most casual sex falls into a ""middle"" territory: they're doing it for status-oriented reasons. The girls find it ""fun"" to get attention from high-status men, and the guys are asserting their status by getting large numbers of women to sleep with them. This variant of casual sex isn't as bad as revenge or manipulation sex, but I'd argue that it's still detrimental. The casual sex subculture represents a regression to pre-monogamous society. Especially in the early, formative years (16-20) a few men get all the casual play, as is also the case in the warlike, lawless, and polygamous societies that humanity had to transcend in order to build civilization. With causal sex, the successful ""alpha"" males turn into overconfident jerks and date rapists. The frustrated ""gammas"" become stalkers, serial killers, and school shooters.<p>No one should underestimate the social value of monogamy. It's a necessity for higher civilization. The alpha male spreads his genes wide and forms no empathic bonds to wives or children (we regard those with strong alpha tendencies, in modern society, as sociopaths). The monogamous beta male seeks one highly desirable partner, has small numbers of children and must invest in the relationships, giving the progeny the best odds of being successful. This makes him egalitarian (toward his wife, whereas alphas treat their wives as chattel) and future-oriented; for this reason, high-ranking betas are the drivers of civilization.<p>Monogamy attempts to render us all shades of ""beta"" status, and by reducing the reproductive stakes of social status, causes status-related violence to become a rarity rather than a common aspect of male life. Casual sex (anti-monogamy) undoes this, increasing social conflict and eroding respect and equality between the genders.",1233287133

Answer: you don't and can't.<p>That being said, there is something positive about using the tools you really do understand as long as the mismatch between the tool and the problem is not too large.  At the very least, you get something working quickly in a way that you understand and you have learned a lot about ""the problem"" in the process.  Most of the time good enough is really Good Enough TM.<p>I use a strict subset of ANSI C for my compiled applications.  Having used C for over 20 years, it has become second nature to me.  As a consequence, I am easily able to solve the kinds of problems I am interested in solving with it.  This works partly because I have the luxury of being able to choose my problems.  The rest of the explanation is that C is almost a portable assembly language and can do almost as much as assembly language without nearly as much effort.<p>Perhaps if I were to choose a different set of problems to solve,  other tools would be more effective.   Since I am not now interested in SAS, Cloud Computing, WEB Applications, Enterprise Services, et.al.  C is Good Enough TM for me.  YMMV.",1233286586

457638,comment,456768,456768,0,0,edb,,,"True story (in a nutshell): I was running a hosting company with a friend of mine. Things were good, our sales were increasing to the point where we quit our jobs to grow the company.<p>It was a good life. Wake up, set your own hours, do some programming on the site and automation tools, take a mental break to communicate with users via email. All in our boxers. Our friends would call us to go out, one of us could handle the emails while the other was out, or hell, we would both leave, so long as people got a reply within 6 hours, everybody seemed to be happy.<p>Life was good, we were both getting laid and our apartments were clean. Every now and then, a customer here and there wouldn't get it and would request a phone call. We gladly called them up, and fixed in 30 mins what normally would take us 7-10 days of back and forth emailing!<p>This gratification encouraged us to put our number on our webpage. We did, and closed many sales over the phone. Our sales tripled, our company grew more. we were both earning 50k/year in profits compared to last year's 20, and growing more than linearly.<p>What happened next? The calls grew more frequent. We would leave them to answering machine and when we would call back, the customers would be angry. Eventually customers called us out on the fact that we only answered calls as of 11:00am and they made us feel guilty about not having a phone answered during business hours.<p>So we conceded. 9am - 6pm our lines would be answered. After all, we owe it to the customers who brought us our livelihood. 2 guys splitting the task; it was maintainable. All of a sudden though, we couldn't work when we wanted. We had to be up and in the office at 9.<p>We tried maintaining our lifestyles, coding killer features until 4am, going out when our friends would call us. Eventually there were consequences for these actions.<p>Gone were the days of coding in our underwear, gone were the haphazard productivity blitzes, gone were the days of our startup's spirit. We lost sleep because we had to be up at 8. Lots of it. If one of us would sleep in, the other would cover until eventually the person waking up early more often would fall to resentment.<p>Our product suffered, our relationship suffered, our productivity blitzes? Gone. We were canceling plans with friends because we had work to do at night that couldn't get done cause we were on the phone. Nobody would outsource our calls, most of our clients spoke french. Our website hadn't changed graphic design since we put our winter theme up. It was july and our logo was covered in snow. Our phone staff kept quitting. Our sales plateaued. We even started wearing pants. I eventually sold my half.<p>Trust me kids, don't put your number on your homepage. Stick to email support and get by. Find a way to get by without a filing cabinet and go travel the world while working.",1233286321

457629,comment,456768,457466,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, I think this is one of those lessons learned from the school or hard knocks, for me.  Sometimes it is just as important to be clear with yourself and the rest of your company about what customers you <i>aren't</i> trying to serve as being clear about what customers you are trying to serve.<p>You <i>cannot</i> satisfy everyone, but early on, when  you have very few customers, you may tell yourself, ""This customer would be worth doing something very different for.""  It is tempting to do anything you can do make a sale.<p>Sometimes, this is just a sign that you aren't targeting the right people yet, and it's time to evolve and grow.  But, if you aren't careful it just leads to you trying to be all things to all people.  I had this problem with my previous company...the questions would come, ""Can you do X, Y, and Z?""  And my thought process would be, ""Yes on X and Y, and I could <i>totally</i> make Z happen, if I just spend two weeks developing it, making this a losing sale, but I'll amortize across future sales of Z.""  And I'd respond, ""Yes.""  I'd make Z possible, and then I would never sell to another customer that needed Z.  To be fair to this thought process, Virtualmin wouldn't exist had I been successful about saying ""No, that's not something we do.""  But, counting up the successes vs. the things that merely distracted me from my real goals, that's batting about .025.  And, I had wanted to make something like Virtualmin for years (and I'd even taken a stab at it three or four years previous and written 10kLoC, or so, and had some basic functionality and a half dozen users)...this customer just gave me an excuse to spend enough time/money on it to make it a reality.<p>Because I (almost) never have to spend an hour on the phone with anyone, either to make a sale or to support the product, I can spend that hour helping a dozen people solve their problems.  Thus, sales are cheaper for us...so we can charge less.  Support is cheaper for us, so we can do more of it, without having to charge extra as our competitors do.<p>If I ever said, ""Yes"", to the question, ""Can I call you?"" all of our math about how we make a profit on software that is as large as ours, while being as cheap as it is (and being 90% available in an Open Source form), would completely go out the window, and our prices would <i>have</i> to become too high to be competitive, or we would just start losing money on every sale, as I did in my previous business.  I'm not saying answering a phone now and then would put us out of business...but I am saying that I don't want to be a telephone IT support business ever again (you're spot on in your assessment that you become every customers IT department, because you're the only company that answers the phone and has smart people on the end of the line--I can't even count the number of times I've fixed peoples routers because they couldn't afford a Cisco support contract).  Before offering to answer phones, think about whether your business can support pricing that high (if you're unfamiliar with Cisco support pricing...do a little digging...be prepared to gasp), or if it will price you right out of the market.",1233285839

",,"Hey all,<p>After inerte's post a few days ago: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=446507, I thought I'd use it as an excuse to fiddle with GAE and jQuery.<p>With props to Bill Watterson [1], I banged up ""transmoggit"": http://www.transmoggit.com/<p>(try something like ""trim"" from PHP -> Python, as an example chosen not-at-all-at-random)<p>It does the obvious mapping thing, and lets you add your own. That's all fine, I guess, but it's not super-useful, until the 2.0 bit kicks in and ""people"" start adding clever translations. Of course, no one will bother to amend translations until there's some reason to visit first.<p>So, my question for the wise crowd: any suggestions on how to automate getting sensible mappings for, say, the easy 50-80%?<p>(any other suggestions are quite welcome too :)<p>thanks,\nscott<p>1. http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Theater/9876/transmog.html",1233284401

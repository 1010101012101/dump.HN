It may not be a smart time investment for a hacker to cultivate that skill themselves, but it is probably a good investment to hire or consult with someone that can come up with a a quality name FOR them.  [Business and marketing geeks need love to, you know?  There are branding geeks on every college campus too, believe me.]<p>I think the importance of a good name is often underestimated in the overall scheme of things.  Founders and VCs don't flinch too much when they spend several grand hiring a legal specialist to draw up incorporation documents  (which is another story)...but it never even occurs to them to spend more time and/or money on something that will likely have a greater impact on their overall success, such as their identity in the marketplace. <p>I'd also argue that part of it goes to TASTE, PG :-) <p>> Google is a pretty bad name, actually.<p>I couldn't agree more.  But they're one of the instigators of this current naming trend (two O's, seemingly nonsensical), so they almost have grandfather status.  It's all of the followers that make these naming trends pathetic.  You don't get lost in the shuffle if you're one of the first.  After a certain point, it's the volume of the similar names that is comical.  During the electronics boom, everything was -etics this and -tek that, then you had iThis and eThat during the late '90s. Now it's Teletubby names.  Why get lost in the shuffle?  Why choose obviously bad names?  <p>It's like a mother that goes through 9 months of pregnancy, X hours of labor, and then names her kid Harry Richard McNuttsac or something because she was too lazy to think it through or consult a book of baby names.\n",1188466802

Something I noted when I hit a rough spot a few months ago was that there is no teenage angst when you're working from six AM till eight PM doing hard labor. Not that I was asking for it!<p>I think it's simply a matter of human nature; given too much leisure, or too high a quality of life, our brains will still be physiologically unable to feel a proportional level of happiness. At the chemical level, there are only so many neurotransmitters to go around. <p>Anyway, the point of all this is that I would have been thrilled to get a ""real"" job at that age, but I'm not sure that was right. I was always very much in a hurry to finish school, and now that I have a job and am in college early, I keep wondering if, and feeling like, I've made a terrible mistake. <p>And a separate point about the article: The cost of college is almost entirely the fact that it uses up the four  most productive years of your life. That most people choose college almost on instinct surprises me. Forget buying a house or a car - this decision is orders of magnitude more expensive. If you want to have an extraordinary life, you're going to be on that path by the time you're 22, or you're not. It's worth noting that Einstein made his contributions to physics at the age of 25, and even that was somewhat old to develop something so innovative. At the same time, while he stayed influential and productive in physics, he never published anything as revolutionary. At a certain age - I'm inclined to think it's usually in the early to mid twenties, based on anecdotal evidence only - you just lose that ability. If you go to college, you're basically saying ""I'll trade my ability to change the world for a predictable life."" And honestly, right now that's a trade I would like to make, but I'm just not doing it, and I don't know why.<p>And besides, every time I put this in writing I am struck by the incredible level of arrogance and hubris in my words (I'm no freaking Einstein!) and I really don't feel like writing again for a long time.

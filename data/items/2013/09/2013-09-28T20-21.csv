6463144,comment,6462912,6462912,7,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"<a href=""http://rubular.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubular.com/</a> is also really great! I use it often when programming ruby regular expressions. Fill in a batch of test strings into the box, then run your regular expression against it, and instantly see (visually) what is happening. This is a BIG plus coming from perl regex 10 years ago ;) This is not a dig a perl regex, but I just remember it was a trial and error loop, where I would continually be iterating the script to see if it worked, where as with this webpage, you just iterate, more quickly.<p>They also have a great example:<p><pre><code>  test string:
  Today&#x27;s date is: 9/28/2013.

  regex:
  (?<month>\d{1,2})\/(?<day>\d{1,2})\/(?<year>\d{4})

  result:
  month	9
  day	28
  year	2013
</code></pre>

I saw someone finish and sell a property management web app in Rails, without knowing Ruby and next to no knowledge of Rails.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  Rails just gives you a lot of things for free.

6463130,comment,6462430,6462833,9,0,smsm42,,,"IMHO this (disallowing trials) is a big mistake. I very rarely would buy an app that I can&#x27;t try. Of course I can afford to lose $1 or whatever - it&#x27;s not the cost but the fact that I had been scammed what would infuriate me. It would only make sense for the app makers to turn my loss aversion against me - if I already used the app for a couple of days and liked it, now the choice for me would be &quot;lose it or pay measly $2&quot; - and that would be completely different game. Given that Apple exercises total and absolute control over the whole ecosystem, it could easily make trial system that makes apps free for 3 days (or 15 days if the developer chooses) and then makes them stop working until you pay. I think it would make Apple ecosystem much more friendly to the user, because frankly reviews are usually worthless and screenshots etc. are not much help either.",1380401551

Just like cellphones are addictive to PEOPLE, this is like crack to organizations of any kind.<p>TODAY: Uploaded a YouTube video with copyrighted song in the background? Video censored. Sent money to a friend on Paypal? Account limited. K-Mart figures out girl is pregnant before her dad knows, based on her shopping. Exceeded speed limit between toolbooths? Instant fine.<p>TOMORROW: Left a parking lot without entering restaurant? Instant towing. Exceeded parking meter by 2 minutes? Instant fine. Exceeded speed limit for 10 seconds on the road? Instant fine. Surfing websites correlated to high incidence of child abuse? Children taken away. Need to be arrested? &quot;parallel construction&quot; will resultin &quot;random&quot; traffic stop and arrest. Facebook, Google, all these companies want your data, not just governments.

I spent 3+ years as a PHP programmer, there&#x27;s <i>certainly nothing wrong with being a PHP programmer</i>, but it&#x27;s hard to argue that in 2013 it is still a good and productive platform to learn. It pains me to see newcomers starting out by learning PHP, they are essentially shooting themselves in the foot for at least a year of their life (if they are going to be a professional web dev). I was pretty productive at PHP, but only because I cut my teeth for years writing shitty cgi-style PHP scripts, learning the abortion they call their stdlib, then using PHP&#x27;s OOP crap and finally using frameworks like CI. Imagine if I had spent that time writing ruby. By the time you get the whole way through, you realize that your &quot;high-level language&quot; <i>should do work for you</i>, not the other way around. I think what it comes down to is that PHP does not mandate good design patterns because it cannot even decide on one itself. Once I understood this, the language was forever tainted.<p>I think the only reason PHP is still relevant is because it&#x27;s so damn accessible (kinda like w3schools), every shared hosting provider under the sun gives you apache+php, and when you&#x27;re starting learning web programming shared providing is the way to go.<p>Why do you say php and Javascript suffer from the same ailments? They suffer from <i>a few</i> of the same ailments, like a crappy/confusing stdlib (although you don&#x27;t see mysql_real_escape_string in javascript&#x27;s API) and funky invisible type coercions. Lack of true OOP in javascript, though confusing to beginners, is a design feature as far as I&#x27;m concerned, prototyping gives you the tools to implement OOP however you like. But javascript has had a known design pattern from the beginning, which is very powerful and useful once you learn it. I strongly doubt a (another?) phplint at this point would change anything.<p>As for the &quot;anecdotally&quot; slide, I read the last statement as a conclusion of the previous stats, which didn&#x27;t make any sense to me.

I was thinking 20 mins a day would be a good amount of time for this.<p>But wait, let&#x27;s take a step back. Does it <i>really matter</i> if I can recall all this engineering material?

It only seems to benefit test takers.<p>I would love to hear counter-arguments for why SRS for engineering materials would be a good idea for those no longer in school, maybe then I&#x27;ll be motivated to build some gamified spaced repetition software.

So she applied when she saw a job ad for Facebook (on Facebook). Started out in customer service (later renamed to something else because customers are people who pay for a service). The engineers and the engineering floor was the place to be. She managed to make it to their domain through a clever side project of her own. Facebook started to grow up once Sheryl Sandberg came in. She made it all the way to the inner sanctum (ghost writing for MZ).<p>It really is a quick read. The parallels that I will be looking for - does DE&#x27;s character protagonist start to reject the &#x27;cult&#x27; culture gradually over time - all the while jumping and up the ranks.<p>The supporting details of the story are what matter: Since FBers all had inside knowledge of FB and couldn&#x27;t manage to slip up and spill projects under development in casual social encounters, they started close-circling their social lives until they just basically hung out night-and-day with other fellow FB employees. And there was a nice passage where she described an ephemeral experience and how it could not be FB&#x27;d. Also, a widely reported FB anecdote - female employees had to wear shirts with MZ&#x27;s face on it and male employees had to wear sandals on MZ&#x27;s birthay (she called in sick - it was <i>too</i> much). All FB company events were <i>professionally</i> photographed - not an accident they looked good (so as to project the best FB brand - smiles, we&#x27;re all having young young fun fun fun)... There was a pivotal moment with a co-worker where they did not go forward (romantically, in the moment) because of what would all their co-workers say when it was FB&#x27;d... The summer pool house was her idea - and she ruled that domain pool-side with her fellow non-geeks.<p>I have a lot of respect for what Eggers has done with 826 Valencia, The Writing Center.

You don&#x27;t own the land, so the property right is inchoate. Or consider the right to buy or sell another right (an option). Also inchoate, but a property right nonetheless. Indeed, these days, your bank account is an inchoate property right.

6462950,comment,6461714,6461961,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is the relevant question. (What does Post-PC mean?)<p>Looking back at the PC &#x27;revolution&#x27; we see that initially computers were in the office and not so much at home. And if they were at home there was only 1 and generally shared.<p>But what PC&#x27;s did was create a place you could deliver an application (the PC provided input/output/storage) for the marginal cost of the software bits (which is quite small). So a tremendous number of companies sprang up to deliver those applications since the rate of return is quite high.<p>As PC&#x27;s migrated home, they did so <i>primarily as an application vehicle</i> and less so as a tool. This is markedly different than most of the readership of this site (which uses computers as tools) but it is far and away the largest use for computers in the home and individually owned computers.<p>The programability came at a price however, it made compatibility challenging (bad mojo to have your app not work on your customers machine) and it enabled a threat to undesired programming (viruses, worms, etc) running on it.<p>For the biggest chunk of the market, the customer&#x27;s ideal device has no programmability capability outside an application&#x27;s need for configuration, no way for any application to interfere with another application, and rock solid compatibility. Sort of the &#x27;game console&#x27; equivalent of information appliance.<p>Apple, Google, and Microsoft are all gunning for that space (and apparently so is Valve :-). Apple&#x27;s approach is an appliance OS (iOS) and a developer OS (MacOS), Google&#x27;s approach is an appliance OS (ChromeOS) and developer tools (Chrome, AppEngine, Etc.), Microsoft has the developer OS (Windows) with what might be called the third attempt at an appliance version (Windows RT) (previously Windows CE and Windows Embedded).<p>If these efforts mature the way their respective owners would like, the bulk of the &quot;computers&quot; out there will be information/data appliances running their appliance environment. Computers will go back to something nerds, scientists. and engineers use and &quot;regular&quot; people ignore.",1380398428
6462949,comment,6461974,6462468,1,0,dombili,,,"Agreed. Having said that, I think something like this would work:<p>For clicking and targeting, you have the touch screen. Dota 2 is a 5vs5 player game. Controller can display all your enemies on the touch screen, just as you&#x27;d normally see their profile pictures at the top of your screen. You can click on their profile pictures to target them when they&#x27;re visible on the map etc. As for the movement, I think movement could be much better with a game controller. You probably can not click on a map and wait for your hero to go to the spot you&#x27;ve clicked on, but you can direct him there with one of the touchpads.<p>I think another big problem would be using the shops. In the current style of the game, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be possible to use the shops with a controller because there are just too many items. Having said that, if Valve really wants people to play Dota 2 with a game controller, I&#x27;m sure they can implement some changes. Currently in game items are seperated in categories. They can use that wheel chat idea with the shop and let players browse through the items. I&#x27;m just brainstorming. It can be done. 2 different UI implementations for 2 different platforms, but one game.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these changes or even playing Dota 2 with a game controller would be ideal, but I think it&#x27;s doable to make the game controller friendly. But there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;m going to give up on my mouse and keyboard for Dota 2 and most of the games that I play (apart from the sports games).",1380398418

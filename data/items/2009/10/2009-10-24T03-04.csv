900094,comment,899867,899881,0,0,rikthevik,,,"I learned asm starting with MIPS and then had the luxury of working at a place that was designing MIPS hardware.  It was nice to be able to get into the assembler when some kernel modification wasn't working very well.<p>I have only good things to say about MIPS as a great place to learn ASM.  The thing is, the better you understand how processors and pipelines work, the better you'll understand why instruction sets are the way they are.<p>If you want to learn a very bad assembler (for programmers) but one that's very to understand (for microcontroller designers), there's always 68HC11.  How do two 8-bit registers and two 16-bit registers make you feel?  (Probably like going to/from memory quite a bit :)",1256356701

JVM sucks for IO, even with its NIO2. It's not portable any more. There is NO JVM for ARM-based platforms. Even Python is more portable. Java is the corporate platform for internal business-related projects (same as .NET is). It is not an universal or even portable platform. The game is over.",1256355108

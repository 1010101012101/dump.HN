On the eve of a highly anticipated IPO, these types of rumors that strike at the core of Facebook's business could quickly blossom to full-on nuclear fusion - regardless of whether or not they are true.<p>I don't disagree that Facebook's prospects look extremely strong, but I do think that their decision to IPO now was wrong and potentially sets up a poisonous precedent for how they run and manage their business.<p>Facebook is <i>still figuring out</i> how to properly grow their revenue model, and now they'll be faced with the very public distractions of being a public company.  Not only that, it opens up all kinds of intelligence for competitors.<p>I think that Mark and his team are in for one heck of a ride this year.  And it isn't going to be fun.",1330131395

They spend money on headphones because music and audio quality is their passion/hobby.<p>Hackers, for the most part, have more money to spend than the average ""consumer"", but music and audio quality isn't necessarily their hobby. If those Bose ads are everywhere and the mini-stores are in airports, or if everyone and their mother has ""Beats"" labeled headphones/earphones, then they're more likely to just spend whatever their budget is on Bose or Beats, because since it's not their passion, they are less likely to research.<p>So we end up with hackers paying more for worse listening experiences than audiophiles. I bet car enthusiasts get a better deal on buying used cars than audiophiles. And chefs pick out better produce than car enthusiasts.<p>Is this really interesting?",1330131371

Is it true that the battery has catastrophic failure when it drains to zero and is left in that state for a sustained period?<p>A. The company has built in countless safeguards to ensure that the battery never drains to zero.<p>Q. That is not what I asked. Please answer the question.<p>A. It is an unfounded rumor that many owners have incurred such a catastrophic failure and only an irrational fear would permit anyone to believe that.<p>Q. I didn't ask about many owners, only whether it is possible to incur a catastrophic failure as described. Please answer the question.<p>A. Our documentation clearly tells owners that it is vital to keep their car plugged in and we give them ever-escalating warnings to ensure that no rational person could ever let the car get close to that state.<p>Q. I didn't ask about the likelihood of this happening, only whether it can happen. Please answer the question.<p>A. We value our customers more than you can imagine and it is slanderous to suggest that we would subject them to risks that can be avoided.<p>Q. Again, not what I asked, please answer the question.<p>A. Every car has risks of catastrophic failure if it is badly misused.<p>Q. Does this mean the Tesla does too with its engine?<p>A. We will not dignify a mere rumor with an answer to that question.<p>Q. And is it true that it costs $40K to replace the battery?<p>A. I object to that as irrelevant.<p>Q. And that it is not covered under warranty?<p>A. Ditto - irrelevant.<p>Q. And constitutes an uninsurable risk?<p>A. We really are off track here. I will not answer.<p>Q. So you do not regard it as worthy of disclosure to your buyers that, should their battery drain to zero for any sustained period, the only remedy is to replace it at their own expense at a $40K cost.<p>A. That disclosure would not fit with our marketing plans. Plus we say something of the sort at page 487 of our owner's manual.<p>Q.Well I guess this was all pretty pointless.<p>A.

Just the act of publishing the mission statement doesn't necessarily - in and of itself - make anyones life better.  The question is, does the mission statement help your organization over the course of years or decades.  Does the culture that you wind up with reflect the decisions that you made - and made concrete - very early on?  Is it easier to make decisions that are in keeping with your principles if you've taken the time to articulate your principles and record them?

However, I'm going to go on general principles rather than 9th circuit precedent, California law, or rules of the court of the City and County of San Francisco, for the simple reason that I am not willing to spend hours checking them<p>Alice\nIf we stipulate the existence of Alice's language with the characteristics you describe, it's hard to see how it could be beyond any sort of analysis - but we'll examine that in more detail with Carol.<p>1. Yes. Alice being a native speaker of English, the court can demand that her testimony, if any, be in the same language as that of the proceedings.<p>2. Where she is a material witness testifying under oath with a grant of immunity, and there is reason to believe that the recorded speech is material to the proceedings - eg if she made a speech in her private language, and then remarked in English upon the subject of her speech.<p>3, 4 - likewise, insofar as she is capable. 2, 3, & 4 are all types of Funniest Joke in the World problems: if the communication is recorded in any form such that a person can understandably repeat it to Alice without themselves understanding the content, then the onus is on Alice to interpret the meaning for the court. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Funniest_Joke_in_the_World"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Funniest_Joke_in_the_World</a>)<p>Carol, the human encryption engine\nMy understanding is that Carol also speaks English; that being the case, the same answers. Carol's lack of insight into her linguistic/cryptographic facility is irrelevant; after all, most people speak fluently in their native language without necessarily being able to analyze how. Illiterate people can't articulate rules of grammar but can still talk; likewise, one can toss a ball reliably without knowing the first thing about calculus or mechanics. This is a Chinese Room type of problem; unlike Searle, I don't think there needs to be an identifiable seat of consciousness.  (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room</a>) Like Hofstadter, courts are concerned with capacity and compliance, rather than epistomological understanding. It is enough that Carol be able to consistently exercise her talent on demand. There's a parallel to this situation with claims of <i>facilitated communication</i> for autistic or otherwise incommunicative people; some cases have fallen apart dramatically in court when the claims of interpretative ability were proved unreliable, though not before some defendants had their lives ruined with false accusations of abuse.<p>Ted\n6. I'm unclear on what basis Ted was detained and his computer examined, and a defense attorney would certainly start by attempting to suppress such evidence if it was obtained via an illegal search. With a grant of immunity, one could compel from any of the three testimony about what contact had occurred between them, if any (eg whether Alice has ever met Ted or given anything to him), and likewise a good-faith attempt at 'translating' the PGP file - <i>eg</i> Carol might be able to decrypt it given a lucky guess at the key, if it were absurdly insecure.<p>7. If Ted is suspected and tried of possessing child porn based <i>solely</i> on the suggestive folder names, and a judge found no reason to suppress, then he would likely be acquitted since the naming of the folders was not done under oath. With no testimony on Ted's part, his defense counsel could argue that there are many possible reasons to engage in such activity. Perhaps Ted plans to create a fictional story about a child pornographer and intends to employ the laptop as a prop - the sort of prop that is often employed in movie and TV shows about police investigations. Perhaps Ted merely has a warped sense of humor. Perhaps he aims to entrap a child pornographer by connecting the laptop to the internet and seeing who downloads the files. Perhaps the files do contain video...of Ted's face as he imagines pornographic situations. The existence of so many possibilities casts a reasonable doubt on the supposition that the folder names are necessarily descriptive of their content.<p>But now take the file content as the hostile characterizations of the law enforcement personnel that you describe. This is potentially incriminating; not because it speaks ill of the legal establishment, but because we must ask how probable it is that the identity of everyone involved in Ted's legal case was foreseeable. If Ted lives in a small town with one cop, one sheriff, one prosecutor, one defense lawyer, one clerk of court, and one judge, and had some reasonable expectation of detention and search - <i>eg</i> a history of poor relations with the town's sole cop - then the involvement of these individuals with Ted's criminal prosecution was highly foreseeable, and it is quite plausible that Ted wrote his hostile prose as a description of what he expected to occur that day, which suspicions have been vindicated by events. In that case, the evidence would probably be exculpatory insofar as it demonstrated Ted's prior belief that he was going to be the victim of legal harassment, albeit in perverse fashion.<p>But since this episode takes place in San Francisco, a city of about 700,000 people, the chances that Ted could accurately predict the identity of everyone connected with his arrest and prosecution in advance are very low indeed. Ted would need to have either superhuman powers of foresight, or introduce additional evidence to show why that combination of individuals was rationally predictable - proof of corruption in the local legal establishment, or an enormously detailed knowledge of administrative scheduling and procedure in multiple different offices - police station, jail, DA's office, Sheriff's office, and Court. The probability of accurate foresight here is so low that a jury might infer Ted had encrypted multiple streams of information in advance and selected an appropriate key during trial: memorizing a list of all law enforcement personnel in advance,  supplying a key representing the ordinal placement of the arresting officer Ted in an encrypted version that list, and using a decryption process that retrieved the name of the officer and substitutes it into a generic 'vile characterization' written and encrypted in advance. This would require a truly impressive memory for multiple long lists, but such feats of memory are not superhuman; there are professional entertainers who specialize in such feats and can explain or demonstrate them.<p>The probability that Ted had the time, capability and inclination to do this is demonstrably higher than the probability that he was clairvoyant or an incredibly good guesser. If, as seems possible, the specificity of the document rested on a trick of memorization and a selective decryption mechanism that could yield multiple valid-seeming plaintext values in response to multiple different keys, then a jury would have to weigh the possibility that the decryption process was intended to be obfuscatory rather than revelatory, and that there might well be a 'meta-key' that decrypted the files into video of child porn for Ted's illicit enjoyment. In other words, a perverse form of steganography that overtly identifies its significant content but frustrates its easy retrieval. Obviously this is all subject to the limits of information theory - if the size of the scurrilous prose plaintext file and the size of the encrypted files were both small and close - only a few kilobytes in length, say - then the probability that the encrypted files also contained contraband video would be correspondingly small. If the encrypted files were several gigabytes each, it would be entirely possible for them to include video, scurrilous plaintext, and multiple lists of names.<p>There would still, arguably, be a reasonable doubt about the nature of the still-hidden data in the file (if any), but the jury would be entitled to take these factors into account when assessing the defendant's credibility. On these facts, I think that Ted would have to be acquitted on charges of possessing child porn, as its existence could not be established beyond a reasonable doubt - if he were convicted, an Appeal court would probably free him. On the other hand, and subject to the estimable probabilities described above, I think he could be convicted of obstruction of justice for wilful frustration of the Court's fact-finding function - not by declining to comply, but by complying in such a manner as to strain the bounds of credibility.",1330129366

He was involved in trying to get a hospital-wide system in, but the CEO was more interested in ""making her mark"" than managing the hospital, which would require forcing the point with the department heads. So quite frequently patients moving between departments would not have their receiving department ready or even aware of their arrival. Generally the issue was that either department heads liked the shiny toys brought by sales rep -foo- (doctors get a <i>lot</i> through sales rep gifts) and didn't want to change because they'd stop getting them; or that the doctor was stonewalling because they didn't want to learn a new system. Classic case of everyone saying ""something must be done... by someone else!"". The kicker is that no matter how persuasive your argument might be, the doc would have the last word with ""children will die if I can't use this software"" and the argument would end.<p>The other story is much shorter: at one bigwig's meeting, one of the senior specialists - a 27-year veteran - shot down a new doctor's comments saying that he wasn't familiar with how things work here. The new doctor's reply? ""I've been here 17 years...""<p>I've had a microcosm of this experience as well. While installing monitoring gear for one of the departments, the department chief went ballistic because the new computers had power cables that were touching the desk: ""It's written into the quote that the power cables will not touch the desk!"". Nonsense, of course, but it's how she gets things to her liking - she was the poster girl for post-contract feature changes.

Nonetheless, it's Tesla's problem. Why? <i>Because electric cars are new.</i> After 100 years of internal combustion, there's a common understanding that cars need their oil replaced if it all leaks out. No one would gain any traction with a story about ruining their engine by running it with no oil. But a story about a driver who left his car at the airport for a month and bricked it <i>will</i> gain traction, and will cost Tesla money by spreading FUD in the market. More money than simply covering that case in its warranty, which I predict is exactly where they're going to end up if this story gets picked up by the mainstream media. They're just taking the long way around to get there.",1330128509

Pointing at a couple of bad examples doesn't mean that sometimes businesses do have to change their processes to fit software that is better for them. Or perhaps a better way of putting it is: business <i>and</i> software should change together to answer what's best for the business.<p>Where I currently work has shitty inventory control - salesforce for sales and device tracking, and an Access database for unit consumption.<p>This is absolutely woeful and has a number of problems to people who know anything about inventory. Want to know where widget #234 is? Well... I hope someone entered it against the sale in Salesforce. Cool, they did. Now, can we make sure that that serial is unique? No. Which batch of components was it made from? No idea. The <i>sale</i> was accepted on this date, but it wasn't installed until two months later... when was that? Is the item still in warranty? We sent device #234 to a demo site, and then it got moved on, and then it came back and then it was sent to another demo site, we can tell that right, because an issue has cropped up where we need to know where it's been? No, there is no history tracking.<p>Trying to track inventory in salesforce is a fool's errand because they have no concept that an item is unique and can have history - anything resembling a serial number is just a user-enterable text field, no protection against duplicates, no protection against assigning it against sale 2 because it's already on sale 1.<p>These are the current business practises where I work, and we've shaped our processes around them. But we're about to start being more hard-lined about warranty terms (until know we've been giving free terms as we've been largely on the VC teat)...<p>The business needs software that is going to be harder and more complex to use than ""yeah, fill in this free text field with whatever you feel like, if you feel like it. So yes, sometimes software needs may look to the casual observer like ""this is so arcane and complex"", but that doesn't mean that they're automatically bad - the slogan above is trite and the real problem is that it implies business shouldn't ever need to change their processes to suit software. I mean, there is a point to the slogan, but it should be rephrased to something more suitable.",1330128384

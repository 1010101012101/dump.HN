Passwords",,"In the wake of the suspicion that encrypted customer PINs were stolen from Target, I am curious to the differences in best practices, if any, between encrypting PINs v. passwords. Naively, PINs are 4[1-9] numbers, which makes any type of rainbow table approach based-on a simple hash, much smaller than 8-16[52+] given caps sensitivity and special chars. However, the nature of PINs is such that you would have to try and fail / succeed in a store. So, even with a single hashed + salt, you might need an impractical number of people / attempts to test for cracking the encryption.<p>Does anyone with insight into PIN / password security have any thoughts?",1388073534

6966500,comment,6965433,6966293,35,0,stiff,,,"I will try to explain. When I came to emacs as a user, a &quot;buffer&quot; seemed just a weird way of saying &quot;tab&quot; without displaying actual tabs. The word choice only started making more sense once I wrote non-trivial amounts of emacslisp. The buffer is the fundamental emacs data structure, like the file is the fundamental unix data structure, so it&#x27;s really important to understand it well.<p>The definition is really simple: a buffer is just a bunch of text from some unknown source, but in fact it is a very powerful abstraction, for two reasons. First, every time you do something in Emacs when simply editing files, you are really executing emacslisp functions on the buffer that is currently displayed. A lot of things you learn in Emacs can be used in three ways: interactively in editing sessions, when automating editing tasks with emacslisp, and finally when doing programming in general, even when it has nothing to do with editing files.<p>Second, a buffer can represent anything, it can of course contain the text of a file, but also of only fragments of a file, or a directory file listing, and, what&#x27;s really great, Emacs binds TCP/FTP/HTTP/... network connections and external processes to buffers as well, allowing asynchronous streaming of incoming data into buffers, so that a emacslisp callback is called every time new text arrives from the process or socket, you can transform it as you wish and insert into the buffer the part to be shown to the user or kept for future processing. Then there are lisp primitives implemented in C like save-excursion which let you execute functions on buffer off-screen, so the same commands that are used for editing can be used for processing HTTP requests or grep output without the user noticing the cursor jumping back and forth or anything of this kind. So, when I am processing HTTP requests in Emacs, I use the same commands I sometimes use in interactive editing sessions, for example I can use re-search-forward to check if the headers were sent completely already and to get number of bytes they contain (the location in the buffer of the end of the headers, in other words). A lot of the weird emacs word like point, mark etc. that seem like anachronistic words for interface elements really are powerful abstractions that apply as much to programming as to the interactive editing.<p>Then there is a lot of other stuff that makes this yet more powerful, you can have buffer-local variables, timers that check buffer input periodically, transaction queues for those asynchronous processes, modes that define buffer-specific key-bindings, menus and behaviours etc., it goes on an on. It&#x27;s a lot like node.js or other asynchronous networking stacks. There is also lot of magic that makes all this work concurrently without Emacs having implemented threads, and that makes it not interfere with the user interface.<p>A lot of the cool things Emacs does follows from this architecture, like the SLIME package for interacting with Common Lisp interpreters (local or remote), Dired for editing directory contents, Tramp for editing files on remote servers, Comint for running interactive processes of various kind inside Emacs etc. It&#x27;s a really great lesson in how naturally features flow out of powerful design ideas.<p>As for resources, I learnt by reading the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference [1], and have done a lot of M-x describe-function and source code reading in the process of writing some elisp more sophisticated than just small editing helpers. E.g. the process stuff is described here:<p><a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Processes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Pro...</a>",1388071542

That said, using these approaches can be quite dangerous because you can end up annoying someone with clout. A simpler and safer way to be overrated is simply to do the following:<p>1) Attend all meetings, ideally be slightly early OR slightly late (and apologetic) but not on-time. One creates the impression you&#x27;re punctual and eager, the other that you&#x27;re super busy and important -- so mix it up. If you&#x27;re always early then you clearly have nothing to do. If you&#x27;re always late then you&#x27;re simply disorganized.<p>2) Reply to all emails within 30-60 minutes (NOT immediately because that increases the probability of an immediate reply). 30 minutes is plenty of time for the sender to get bored and work on something else, e.g. updating Facebook. Ideally if you&#x27;re being asked to do something you should either request more information or somehow hand it off to a colleague (or, if it&#x27;s really easy, just do it -- unless you actually enjoy screwing with people). This will create the impression that you are totally on top of things and never the bottleneck.<p>3) There&#x27;s no third thing. You&#x27;re done. You can now rise to the top of virtually any organization. Obviously, it helps to have some clue as to what&#x27;s going on (e.g. what project you&#x27;re on and what your role is supposed to be -- your emails should at least make sense in context).<p>All the other stuff mentioned in the article is great if it works, but potentially lethal if you screw the wrong person. E.g. claiming credit may work great in the short term, but it will make you enemies. Remember, some people in the organization may give a damn or know something. Why take the risk? Just show up to meetings and answer emails. People will assign you credit for modesty if nothing else.<p>I might add that if you do this stuff, and -- if only to avoid boredom -- pay some attention during meetings, actually read the emails you respond to, and try to be reasonable when you say or write something, you&#x27;ll actually be a way-above-average contributor to many bureaucracies.",1388071275

However, Facebook is still heavily used for setting up events, sharing photos, and messaging people. The reason why facebook is so good at all of these things? Because everyone has Facebook. If I need to ask a friend something, There are several ways to ask them:<p>- Text: Might not have their number, have to pay, it&#x27;s only available on their phone, not on their computer<p>- WhatsApp (or similar): They may not have it, I may not be their contact, only available on their phones<p>- SnapChat: Hard to hold a conversation with someone<p>- Instagram: Great for sharing photos, not for communicating<p>- Facebook: Am Friends with everyone I will need to contact. Easy to use. They receive it on their phone and computer (more likely to see it sooner).

As people became comfortable with each other, they often shared personal contact information (mostly, privately).  And because they were otherwise anonymous, they felt comfortable sharing and discussing matters they otherwise would not have.  To everyone&#x27;s benefit.<p>We had limits, and these were stated up front, and forum members felt invested in pointing them out and helping to enforce them (e.g. reporting serious violations) when necessary.  Forum members also had input to the policy, both in ongoing suggestions as well as during periodic, publicly announced reviews.<p>People participated as much, or as little, as they wanted to.  And they shared, both publicly and privately, what they wanted to.  Private and orthogonal communication channels were, well, if not overtly encouraged, then certainly not discouraged -- although we would caution people about sharing too much too quickly.<p>Think about it.  Take your time.  &quot;Opt in&quot; to what you are comfortable with.<p>We ended up with a very loyal and long-standing community.  And a significantly sized one, that did literally span the globe.<p>Now, from a mass commercial perspective, perhaps many people will find difficulty in how such policy and site is supposed to work, financially.  And I&#x27;m not saying I have all the answers to that.<p>Nonetheless, &quot;opt-in&quot; still nags at me as the way to go.<p>When Facebook was more &quot;opt-in&quot;, it was the hotness.

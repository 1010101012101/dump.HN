Amazon can easily address those problems and make their platform much more attractive.<p>Audible has also experimented with mixing narration onto an e-book experience.  Needless to say, if the deal goes through, Amazon's Kindle will offer a more integrated audiobook+reading experience so you can read along with a professional narrator using automatic page turning.<p>If I remember correctly, Don Katz, the Audible CEO, had spoken to Bezos in the early days of Audible.  Bezos thought a digital audiobook business was a great idea but a decade too early.  Looks like the waiting period is over.<p>This is great news for Audible the company and not so great news for shareholders who believed it could do really well independently.  A number of us have been, in the words of one of my ADBL.org members, ""addicted customers and weary shareholders.""  For a blast from the past, you can read a somewhat slanted story about us in an old NYTimes article:
<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/23/business/yourmoney/23penny.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/23/business/yourmoney/23penny...</a><p>There have been some execution issues since that Las Vegas party, but this acquisition will ensure the company's growth even if it doesn't give much to shareholders.  Would be surprised if Apple gets in a bidding war, so Apple's reaction will be interesting.  Shareholders were hoping for an acquisition with Amazon five years ago.  Then we were thinking Apple would be the more likely acquirer. I guess it's not surprising that the deal went through now that ADBL stock price plunged over the last three months.",1201815592

--Yes. Motorola is failing.  That's what happens when you have been in a business for too long and get complaicent. The new entrant will eat your lunch.
Moto, deserves to fail.  They need to make a huge revamp of their software.  Same problem with Palm. They are toast.<p>At least it seems that RIM (Blackberry maker) is getting a little bit smarter, and it is finally going to update their software stack.  Until a year ago, they thought that just having good email support would be enough.  Well... no. Users also like multimedia, good support, navigation, pretty UI... etc. etc.<p>While the koreans, just like they do in with they cars, just copy what they see successful (I am talking about LG and Samsung).  They society just doesn't reward new thinking.",1201813830

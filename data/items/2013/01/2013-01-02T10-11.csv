A big factor in weight loss and gain are hormones and calories don't say a thing about those.<p>For instance, to gain weight (muscle), bodybuilders will consume large amounts of carbohydrates (for a variety of reasons), but the most important is spiking insulin in the presence of protein to shuttle the protein to the muscles to begin building them after breaking them down.<p>Similarly, obese people should be cutting all carbs out b/c of the same insulin spike.<p>But there are other foods which are highly insuligenic. Whey protein, for instance, can spike insulin. MCT oil at high doses can. Heck, egg whites with no fat (no yolk) to balance it can spike insulin.<p>The point is that calories are, at best, an incomplete picture. At worst they are misleading and a distraction.

It is impossible to gain weight for calories you have not eaten.<p>None of your analysis in anyway shows, or even hints at the 'fact' that Eating more will necessarily make you weigh more.  It is totally possible that someone can eat 3k calories a day, but no carbs, and this could have all types of effects; like a slight increase in body temperature due to a different rate of caloric burning, or maybe not everything is getting digested and he is shitting out 1.5k calories a day for some dietary reason you don't understand.<p>In the same way you cannot say ""well logically, I put 5 gallons of gas in a car and went 25 miles, therefore there must be 1 gallon of gas left"" without knowing specifics about an engine; you cannot do the same with humans, which you essentially are.  Further, our bodies/engines are dynamic; and some of our internal systems are more or less effecient depending on a number of factors that you don't understand (for example, it is possible that eating certain types of calories have chemicals/enzymes related to them that cause other systems in the body to change effeciency).  You have one side right:<p><pre><code>    If you want to lose weight you can be absolutely sure that by cutting down calories, below a certain threshold, you will lose weight.
</code></pre>
But, then you go too far and say this is the only thing at play.   In fact, you don't have any logical reason to make the second statement; it admittedly seems to make sense at face value, but ketosis is absolutely real, and people are shedding weight and still eating a ton of calories, regardless of whatever graphs/analysis you are making.",1357123350

List comprehensions describe straightforward transformations of other lists in convenient notation. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension</a><p>They're syntactic sugar for map and filter. Consider this python code:<p><pre><code>    [x**2 for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 1]
</code></pre>
This is a list comprehension. It's equivalent (in 2.x) to the Python<p><pre><code>    map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x%2 == 1, range(100)))
</code></pre>
(or in Clojure,<p><pre><code>    (map #(* % %) (filter #(= 1 (mod % 2)) (range 100)))
</code></pre>
(seems like cheating to use the odd? function))<p>...so, equivalent to map and filter, just with better syntax.<p>Caveat: in 3.x, python's map and filter return generators, so the equivalent comprehension would be a generator comprehension instead--just the same thing as above but wrapped in parens and not square brackets--which would also return a generator.",1357122639

There are also issues like insulin reaction; so far I believe in this one, as hunger doesn't seem to feel as bad and doesn't disable my thinking since around the time I cut out sugars completely (I used to drink a lot of them).

As another comment said, it reminds me of TCL.<p>I'm not convinced on the string-based macros. They enable really cool stuff, like scala's XML literals, but it seems like they'd make syntax-aware editors impossible.<p>I'd suggest moving away from the lispy names for things (cons, cond, defun, cdr). This is (presumably) a language that appeals to people who like the elegance of lisp's reflexivity but can't stand the syntax; names from a more familiar language would appeal to them, while anyone who's firmly attached to lisp names is probably also attached to brackets.",1357121250

 ((calories in) - (calories out)) / 3500 = (l lb of weight loss)<p>The Hacker's Diet holds as an axiom that calories from fat, carbohydrate and protein are equivalent in this formula. This assumption neglects the powerful influence of the hormone insulin, which plays a key role in regulating fat metabolism. Insulin release is very highly correlated with carbohydrate consumption, and a diet that restricts carbohydrate will often lead to weight loss.",1357120916

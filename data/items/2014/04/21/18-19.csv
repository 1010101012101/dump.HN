Our teacher is Chinese.<p>I must say that I find Chinese to be refreshingly &quot;easy&quot;. There is so little grammar and rules that I have fallen in love with the language from day 1. Just learn your words and draw your characters and you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Maybe it is because I&#x27;m Dutch and Dutch is known for being one of the hardest languages to learn? I don&#x27;t really like Dutch actually. Also, I&#x27;ve spend a lot of time learning German, which isn&#x27;t fun at all.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;ve just found the right teacher.",1398106790
7622924,comment,7622432,7622432,8,0,bane,,,"When written Chinese was simplified there was a short-lived movement to move towards non-logographic system called Bopomofo or Zhuyin Fuhao which has the cool aspect of still looking non-Western, but being a phonetic system with unambiguous &quot;spelling&quot;. My understanding though is that it still introduces significant issues with homophones (including tones) which is sorted out in written Chinese by unique characters.<p>It probably could have been resolved with superscript numbers and a strictly controlled dictionary that mapped each number to a specific dictionary definition for a homophone. But that&#x27;s not what happened and instead we ended up with Simplified Chinese which is still among the most complex written languages ever created.<p>I believe it&#x27;s still used in some dictionaries as a pronunciation guide however.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for Chinese, but for Korean there&#x27;s a large number of Chinese loan words, except spoken Korean doesn&#x27;t have tones and it does introduce a number of comprehension issues when context is ambiguous and the different words are written with the same Hangul. This wasn&#x27;t really an issue in the past as Korean used the Chinese system until Hangul started becoming more commonplace.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo</a><p><a href=""http://www.omniglot.com/writing/zhuyin.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/zhuyin.htm</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters</a><p><a href=""http://hunjang.blogspot.com/2005/04/koreans-reading-comprehension-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hunjang.blogspot.com/2005/04/koreans-reading-comprehe...</a>",1398106781

I assume the difference here is that no one cares about the Apple TV, so there&#x27;s little incentive to hack it (exaggeration, but the difference in Apple TV owners vs. iPhone owners is probably several orders of magnitude). Even if you did hack it, what&#x27;s the point? There&#x27;s no hard drive to store your pirated videos, and IIRC these things can stream videos from your PC out of the box anyway.

7622853,comment,7621804,7621854,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> And there are theoretical limits to what you can do with lossless compression and I suspect that the algorithm in the show breaks those.<p>Compression schemes achieve better results the more they&#x27;re tailored to the data you&#x27;re compressing. The theoretical limits are not the issue.<p>For example, here&#x27;s my compression algorithm for popular movies: You take the most popular 255 movies of all time as of a particular date and include an uncompressed copy of all of them within the compression algorithm itself. Then the compression scheme works as follows: If the first byte is not a zero, the decompression code will emit one of the 255 most popular movies, and the 255 possible non-zero values for the first byte identify which one. If the first byte is a zero, what follows is an uncompressed copy of a movie that is not one of the 255 most popular movies, and the decompression code merely strips the first byte.<p>Using that algorithm I can compress each of the 255 most popular movies into a single byte. That&#x27;s basically the theoretical limit. You could create a compression algorithm that could compress every film ever released into maybe three or four bytes. The problem is naturally that such an algorithm is a) completely useless for all the films that haven&#x27;t been released before the algorithm is created, and b) completely impractical because the compression algorithm itself is far too large to be distributed or stored efficiently. Because it&#x27;s a trade off, and achieving the theoretical limit for data size takes the trade off too far in the direction of specializing the algorithm to the data.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t exist algorithms that make a more interesting trade-off than the existing ones do. Suppose you specifically design a compression algorithm for music. It&#x27;s pre-programmed with the sounds made by common musical instruments and that are common in human singing. If the recording contains a guitar playing a G#, the algorithm identifies it as a guitar playing a G# and calculates the difference in pitch, volume, tempo, etc. between the recording and the idealized note built into the algorithm. That would be a significantly more complicated compression algorithm than most of those currently used, and it probably wouldn&#x27;t get very good compression ratios for recordings of things other than music, but you would have something that could conceivably compress most music better than existing compression algorithms.",1398106004

The first Coursera class really turned me on to the elegance of functional programming with Scala&#x27;s unique type system, but much of that elegance is really lost dealing with some of the structures introduced in the second class, in my opinion.<p>Reactive is split into three &quot;subclasses&quot;. The beginning part, taught again by Odersky, was a pretty useful extension of what was taught in the first class. As with the first class, the lectures were very well thought out. Although, some of the examples abandon the beauty of side-effect free programming, which was a letdown after really being turned on to that style in the first course.<p>The middle section on Futures and ScalaRx was pretty rough. Those lectures, done by Erik Meijer (I believe), were less clear and less well planned. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s an impedance mismatch between Scala and the reactive style or if ScalaRx is just the wrong abstraction, but the joy of Scala was completely lost for me in these two lectures. I&#x27;m used to Javascript&#x27;s Promises/Deferreds, which are essentially the same thing as Scala&#x27;s Futures/Promises, but the former are far more intuitive syntactically.<p>I did, however, find the final three lectures on Akka to be very well taught. I had no experience on actor model programming, but I came away very intrigued by the possibilities.<p>A complaint that spans all three sections was that the assignments could be better focused on the the concepts at hand. Each can require a fair bit of constructing your own test and debugging frameworks to figure out how to pass the rather opaque and unhelpful automatic grading system. I eventually lost patience and quit doing the assignments after floundering with the tools.",1398105906

So we&#x27;ll never resolve that one. It&#x27;s a fairly subjective call. They&#x27;re two sides of the same coin. It&#x27;s a &quot;skill&quot; variable if managing that feature is part of the job, and &quot;luck&quot; if not so (perhaps that feature is unmanageable.)<p>I take a different and much more negative approach. Once a company or ecosystem (such as VC-funded technology, increasingly shifted toward marketing-driven light tech) ceases to add value, it reaches a state in which neither luck <i>nor</i> skill is the main variable, but pre-existing social class and status. Indeed, one might argue that the appearance that it&#x27;s <i>either</i> luck or skill is an intentional deception.<p>Take college admissions.

It&#x27;s not luck or skill at all. It&#x27;s deeply classist which extracurriculars are valued and which are not, and it&#x27;s made to look random to one set of people, and skill-driven to another, because the reality is socially unacceptable.<p>The same applies to Silicon Valley.

All the content that Aereo rebroadcasts is already <i>required by law</i> to be publicly accessible <i>and unencrypted</i>(!)[0]. This is why they only serve over-the-air content - the same law does <i>not</i> apply to DVDs rented, or even to cable television.<p>Also, to my knowledge, Aereo does not deduplicate content stored, whereas Zediva essentially does. You and I know that there&#x27;s no difference between &quot;my&quot; digital copy and &quot;your&quot; digital copy, but Aereo does store a separate copy per-user <i>and</i> only distributes each copy to the correct user.<p>The reason that Aereo separates those copies is because we already have case law that establishes my right to record an over-the-air broadcast and replay it for myself[1]. Aereo maintains that it is acting on behalf of the customers to exercise the customers&#x27; right to create <i>personal</i> recordings. If they de-duplicated the data (as Zediva did), they&#x27;d certainly save a lot on storage and hardware costs, but they&#x27;d no longer be protected by this legal precedent.<p>Aereo has a very well-funded legal team that is certainly aware of Zediva and other landmark legal precedents[2] - they specifically crafted their entire business around the Cablevision ruling and other case law.<p>[0] In 2012, the FCC decided to allow cable operators to encrypt these signals, but even this only applies to the retransmission: &quot;The FCC wants to ensure that consumers can still access basic cable services without specifically renting a box from the cable companies.

More often than not, the interfaces are proprietary because good standards simply don&#x27;t exist to do what is required.<p>A large part of the problem often overlooked by the tech community is that none of the existing web standards are useful for the Internet of Things. It needs a new set of standards designed for the purpose so that applications can support the operations necessary at the throughput and operation rates required by IoT.<p>For example, something that comes up a lot at the standards meetings is representation of data. Formats like JSON and XML were fine for the web, but when you have to continuously parse a billion records every second the implied computational cost of just parsing using most existing standard formats is extraordinary. It shifts the economics such that computational efficiency becomes totally worth the implementation cost.

That was just meant to be an observation of an extreme case (optimizing happiness/your feeling of happiness at expense of everything else, as opposed to striving for a goal at expense of your own feeling).

Although it’s awkward to cram more information into a hidden tab on Paper — if birthdays are so important, why aren’t they in Paper’s main news feed? — the additional information also helps Paper live up to its billing as a place for news and stories from your social graph. For some people, birthdays and invitations are a vital part of that news stream, even if, for others, such information is trivial or better placed in the core Facebook app.<p>1. The Events and Birthday features were planned before Paper was announced. It&#x27;s not feature bloat, it&#x27;s a &quot;second release&quot; feature planned ahead of time.<p>2.

Everyone joins a social media site because the people in a defined group (however that is implemented) are interesting. Over time people join the group, and some leave; alas, those joining tend to be less interesting than whoever was there (and attracted participants), the interesting people tend to leave because they&#x27;re surrounded by ever more uninteresting people (and find more interesting people elsewhere), traffic increases, signal-to-noise ratio decreases, average level of interesting plummets, people leave because it&#x27;s boring, cycle repeats elsewhere. Insofar as the site is a directory of connections, participants find their list is dominated by people they don&#x27;t know/care, but as nobody wants to perform the cruel step of actually sever connections, nor wants to spend the considerable time required to do so, they leave for somewhere fresh (hey, the old account is still available if they <i>want</i> to contact someone, but that ends up just being neglected). Eventually one leaves a trail of abandoned accounts, still active but ID & password - even the site itself - forgotten.<p>FB has tried to solve this with some algorithm filtering thru activity of friends, leading to a disjointed slate of postings which is interesting enough to casually browse, but suffers from a still low S/N ratio <i>and</i> leaves it almost impossible to find an interesting post short of scrolling thru hundreds of disorganized items. Result is an experience just interesting enough to keep people checking FB, but not exactly <i>useful</i>.<p>&quot;Upvoting&quot; helps identify interesting posts/users, but that&#x27;s the decision of the voters, not the reader.<p>So...someone creates yet another social media site, using some new tech to change the media or voting or ranking or filtering or something ... and it all goes thru the same social media lifecycle, dying when the S/N ratio reduces the activity to little more than yet another directory of connections.<p>Give me a way to filter those who are interesting <i>to me</i>, with some visual gradient that I can read or skip sections of as I read based on momentary whim.

7622554,comment,7620757,7621396,1,0,acjohnson55,,,"I don&#x27;t think anyone is under the impression that anything about the model of charging retransmission fees for one-to-many streaming is going anywhere. If it did, then sure, cable companies could do what they do today and simply not pay fees. But that possibility isn&#x27;t even on the table right now.<p>I don&#x27;t think DVR fundamentally has anything to do with the transcoding. You could just store and time-shift the native stream and get rid of the transcoders. I suspect that the transcoding is done primarily to conserve bandwidth.<p>To me, the DVR is pretty much a settled question under Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision [1]. The real question is whether Aereo is allowed to rent you an antenna.<p>[1] <a href=""http://betanews.com/2009/06/29/cable-dvrs-are-legal-supreme-court-denies-appeal-of-cablevision-decision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betanews.com/2009/06/29/cable-dvrs-are-legal-supreme-...</a>",1398103295

Inflation means $5M was worth more in 1949 than in 1989, but investments can (and often do) beat inflation. So, assuming one invests successfully, one could work in 1949 for the 1949 equivalent of today&#x27;s $125,000, continue on until 1989 with inflation-adjusted pay but no raises, and end up with $5M in 1989. In any case, that would, as you say, be very different from a normal job.",1398103284
7622552,comment,7620757,7620992,1,0,gamblor956,,,"The differences between your a Geek Squad-installed DVR and Aereo:<p>- The GS DVR actually, physically exists and can be owned by the user.  The Aereo DVR is a software <i>service</i> product (i.e., a SaaS, which cannot be owned).<p>- The antenna you own can be controlled by you--you can change its position, fix its location, or uninstall it. You cannot control the Aereo antenna, nor do you own it.<p>- The GS DVR connects to its source(s) and display directly. The Aereo DVR connects to its source over a multitude of cables and intervening hardware, and connects to the user&#x27;s display over the internet, passing through numerous routers, switches, and hubs along the way.<p>- The data received over your antenna is unique to the specific reception qualities of your antenna.  The Aereo antenna in your proposed single-antenna solution yields a common data stream.  (This is the key legal turning point of the lawsuit.)",1398103267

7622550,comment,7618971,7619431,2,0,saraid216,,,"> Well, but I think we have to figure out what and whether we can do something about it (inequality), how much, and for what cost (cost in the non-economic sense).<p>Agreed.<p>> I think the observation that power accumulates in one way or the other, capitalism or not, seems to hold in any society.<p>Sure. And disease also spreads. Just because we haven&#x27;t figured out how to inoculate ourselves against power accumulation as a society doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible or wrong.<p>I haven&#x27;t read Foucault, but I&#x27;m pretty sure he answers a lot of your questions.<p>> I would argue that the only things that hurt a society when it comes to accumulation of wealth/power is actually _using it in a detrimental_ sense.<p>Detrimental according to who? Everyone, <i>everyone</i> agrees that accumulation of wealth/power hurts society when it is used in a detrimental sense. That&#x27;s the definition of the word &quot;detrimental&quot;. Classical liberalism was founded on understanding that this statement <i>means nothing</i>.<p>Why are luxuries detrimental? Why is crony capitalism detrimental? Why is inefficiency detrimental? These are questions that you haven&#x27;t answered, because your proposal is arbitrary. Liberalism, classical or not, holds up universalism as an ideal because arbitrary measures are problematic, not least because they remain unreasoned from agreed principles but more importantly because they&#x27;re ultimately elitist. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I&#x27;m not disagreeing that they&#x27;re detrimental; I&#x27;m saying that you&#x27;re identifying symptoms.<p>And I suspect the reason is this:<p>You see societal solutions in economic, not political, terms. And that&#x27;s a problem, because people are not defined in economic terms. It&#x27;s not a surprise in a place like HN; most of us are engineers and we like quantifiable problems and answers. A politician is scary, because a politician plays with forces we don&#x27;t have the same grasp on.<p>My advice? If you want to understand power, stop learning about money. Yes, they&#x27;re strongly correlated, but you&#x27;re never going to get a racist to stop beating up differently colored people by offering them a million dollars.",1398103240

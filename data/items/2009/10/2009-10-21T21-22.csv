My assumption is most netbooks are being bought as a secondary machine to compliment either a desktop or a bulky 7-10lbs PC laptop that may perform well but is definitely not super portable. So let's say someone spends $500-$600 for the primary computer and another $300-$400 on the netbook. That adds up pretty close to the sticker price of a Macbook 13"" which can legitimately serve both purposes as a primary computer and a highly portable computer.

In practice, I mostly want to synchronize dot-files and other small files across computers, and broadband to Dropbox isn't terribly slow.<p>The real issue is conflict handling.  When Dropbox detects a conflict between two versions which have become out of sync in a non-fast-forward type way, it creates two versions, the more recent version, and the old version with the host that created it and the date.<p>This is probably the right thing to do, but since it is doing so for the encrypted versions of the files, rather than the unencrypted versions, you end up with files like: ""./j85-6kOFk3Gg0Lg1TiuqgqIz/8p2kJa8tboYSSpadfuiE9Tuq"" and ""./j85-6kOFk3Gg0Lg1TiuqgqIz/8p2kJa8tboYSSpadfuiE9Tuq (quiet's conflicted copy 2009-10-21)"" with seemingly no way to access the conflict version through encfs.<p>If anyone has an idea how to fix this, I'd quite appreciate it.

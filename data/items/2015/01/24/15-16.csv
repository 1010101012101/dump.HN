Before I had a very loose daily structure but was noticing my output and general health was suffering, so trying to stick to this structure on weekdays:<p>6:30 - Alarm on gym days, otherwise I just naturally wake up around 7-8<p>7:30 - work with my PT on gym days and refresh myself after, or on non-gym days I catch up on the Internets and prepare for the day<p>8:30 - hit a coffeeshop and motor through client work (mornings are where I find it best for me to work on this stuff)<p>12:30 - lunch break, where most of the time I just grab something from the same vegetarian restaurant and bring it home and usually couple with reading a book during this time<p>13:30 - nap if I’m tired, otherwise continue with client work, though my energy levels are usually sapped by now so I work on low-hanging fruit items<p>16:30 - wind down, catch up on the Internets<p>The rest of the evening is more loose, either hanging out with friends, playing some board or video games, figure out if I need to restructure possessions or other things in life, or continue my indie game dev hobby (recently started). I go to sleep anywhere between 22:00-2:00. I also try to make a todo list for the next day so I do less planning on the fly, but that habit hasn’t sunk in yet.",1422115112

In particular, pay attention to the reason why she ran the second study and what was actually being measured, namely reactions to this paragraph:<p>“I disagree with the many people who think that women should be cherished and protected by men. You know I’m strongly against that whole idea that in a disaster women should always be rescued before men. And I really don’t agree with those who say that men should put women on a pedestal or that men are incomplete without women in their lives. There seems to be this popular attitude that women are more pure and moral than men and that women should therefore be treated with greater respect than men, but I think that’s a lot of nonsense.”<p>The second study found that simply prefixing that paragraph with “I’m a firm believer in equality between men and women. And because of that” removed much of the ambiguity which lead many people to conclude that the author was probably a misogynist.<p>Beyond that, simply looking at the test is already telling you that this isn&#x27;t the sweeping result certain defensive men are claiming – it&#x27;s a single study measuring reactions to a single, somewhat stilted paragraph over the internet in isolation (they used Mechanical Turk to get participants). That doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not a decent study but it would immediately tell you not to believe the results apply generally to complex real-world interactions where few normal people randomly state manifestos like that and almost everything happens in a context with a history of past interactions which guide the listener&#x27;s interpretation.",1422113820

I&#x27;m responsible for the IT budget, our software developer salaries are the single largest company &quot;expense&quot;.<p>When I started several years ago it came to my attention that the existing developers and IT staff were drastically underpaid (there was one other internal developer, an internal IT guy, myself, and a few outside contractors). I brought it to the attention of my bosses (managing partners) and have made it my goal to bring other developers salaries up to par. When I was hired I was making almost double what the other two were. I realized one of the biggest risks to the company was if either one of them decided to look across the street and find they could probably get a 40% raise on the spot. If they left a lot of knowledge and investment would walk out the door.<p>Over that past few years we&#x27;ve weened ourselves off the contractors/consultants and have hired internally. We are now at ~8 developers. In order to hire the more recent developers we&#x27;ve had to offer market rate salaries. During reviews and hiring I&#x27;ve always told employees not to discuss their salary, mostly for psychological reasons. No matter what someone will feel bad. &quot;What if you make more than them? They might not think you&#x27;re worth more than them. Causing tension and friction. What if they make more that you? Same thing.&quot;<p>I know that some have discussed it salary with others. At times it ticks me off.. makes me want to ensure they aren&#x27;t lying by reducing their or withholding their next raise. (Please note that&#x27;s a immediate gut reaction and I throw it out the window) quickly.<p>I&#x27;m happy to report, after much effort, I&#x27;ve been able to show the managing partners again this year that some developers still need larger than COLA raises (some should get 20%, 15%, 10% and most 5%). They are weary but I think they finally understand the importance of this. We do reviews and raises in a few months, and when I sit down with them I will still insist on not talking about salary or raise (amount/percent) and use the same explanation as before.<p>Yes, no one wants to be taken advantage of and the easiest way we think about doing that is salary transparency. That would work great in a world were psychology and subjectiveness didn&#x27;t exist. I tend to be a very logical, analytical, rational personal. And as much as I hate office politics, emotions getting in the way, and having to hack psychology, they exist and as the logical, analytical, and rational person I think I am those things must be factored into going about things.",1422113817

If the answer to 1 is no then he doesn&#x27;t like to travel abroad and if the answer to 2 is no then he doesn&#x27;t like to read.&quot;<p>In essence, she determined two quick filters that were the most important to her.<p>I had a manager who had a similar test for candidates. He would give them a 5 question tech test where the first question had a &quot;trick&quot; item. Specifically, sort multiple 5GB+ files on a box with 1GB of RAM but 100GB of disk space. If the candidate got the first question wrong, that was the end of the line for the candidate. Why? It showed that they:<p>a. Didn&#x27;t have attention to detail<p>b. Didn&#x27;t fully understand basic technical constraints e.g. in this case RAM is limited but disk is not.<p>One other point I always like to make is to screen candidates in parallel. For example, if your process is to bring someone in to the office and then give them a tech test, that&#x27;s a serial process.<p>On the other hand, if you give the tech test to recruiters and say &quot;Have candidates fill this out and then send it in&quot;, you just created a parallel process to screen candidates.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard people say &quot;What if they look up the answers?&quot; to which I reply: if you give someone a test with google-able answers and they still get it wrong, you just filtered out a pretty bad candidate.

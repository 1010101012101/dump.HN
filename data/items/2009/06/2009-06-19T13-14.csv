665114,comment,664728,664728,0,0,ccc3,,,"The point that seems to completely elude 37signals is that not every industry operates the same way as web design and development. They've taken their very narrow range of experience and told us that it applies to all projects in every industry (he cites Denver International Airport and the Big Dig in his post). This is such an outlandish notion that it becomes difficult to take them seriously at all.<p>As an example, I work as a design engineer in the R&D wing of an automotive supplier. If we were to just start building products on a hunch, without any market research or project planning, we could easily spend hundreds of thousands of dollars or more before we knew if we were headed in the right direction.<p>Ultimately planning is imperfect and comes at a cost (time and resources), but that needs to be compared to the cost of no planning at all. In the web app business the cost of trying a new idea may be next to nothing, so trial and error becomes the most expedient method. In my industry, we're aware that our plans are imperfect, but if they allow us to cut a few very expensive iterations out of the development process then they're worth it.",1245419751

665108,comment,665029,665029,0,0,caffeine,,,"Hi - I was in a similar situation a year ago (starting a Master's in ML, feeling crappy at math).  What worked for me was:<p>- Studying is doing problems.  Reading is not studying.  When studying, read the minimum amount necessary to complete the problem.  Do all problems CLOSED-book: no notes or reading while doing problems.<p>- A problem is not understood until you can do it on a blank piece of paper two days after reading the relevant material (so do problems several times to check).<p>- Study machine learning problems that <i>use</i> the math.  The examples in math text books are pretty useless to you - do ML problems directly. When you don't get it, look the math up quickly in a reference book (A.E.M. by Kreyszig works), as much as needed to complete the problem, and move on.<p>- Implement regularly.  Once you've done the problems concerning an algorithm or technique, implement it.  Make sure your implementation is correct, and spend some effort making it quick.  Read source code for other people's implementations.<p>This method is effective (for me) because I <i>like</i> programming and machine learning, I <i>don't like</i> math textbooks or the problems within, and I can't remember what I haven't solved.<p>Book recommendation:  David MacKay's (free) book: Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms (<a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/</a>)<p>- Enjoyable: not terse or uptight, engaging reading.<p>- Problem-focused: the text is really explanations between interesting problems.  The problems are spread throughout the text rather than bunched at the end - this is a huge advantage.<p>- Deep and unifying: You don't get this perspective often.  Helps you think about AI/ML from a strong theoretical perspective.  Will give you lots of ""Aha!"" moments.<p>- Math: Plenty of math, but not unnecessarily difficult.  The practice you'll get doing these problems will serve you in other situations.",1245419584

It covers the fundamental concepts of mathematical analysis and proof-writing (and, perhaps more importantly, <i>reading</i> proofs) and will help give you a great grounding for further reading, especially in the areas of discrete mathematics, set theory, and probability. I can't recommend it enough as an enjoyable introduction to the field.<p>Also, for a good probability textbook, I would point you to 'Probability and Random Processes' by Grimmett and Stirzaker. It may be a bit hard-going at first (which is why I recommend How to Prove It to get you used to rigorous maths), but it is a very thorough text that also happens to concentrate on many areas of interest to the average programmer (Markov chains and the like). Together with the companion book of exercises, it should be fantastic for self-teaching, too.<p>In calculus, you have so many options that I can only really suggest you go out and find one that you like.

They can come off as quite hubristic, but if you drill through the latent groupthink and individual over-assertiveness, you'll find a gigantic wealth of information on both what rationality is, and how to apply it to your life.<p>Additionally, check out (I've mentioned these before, so I'll quote myself verbatim):<p>""Problems On Algorithms"" (Parberry, Gasarch): A slim volume containing ~700 exercises on proving various properties of algorithms.

Your link was interesting, but nowhere therein did I see any mention of this basic tenet changing when we move from a criminal to a civil case. Justice is portrayed as a blind person for a reason; and it doesn't matter an iota if you're talking about civil or criminal law.<p>And, in any case, the comment I was replying to used the example of <i>car theft</i>, which manifestly <i>would</i> involve a criminal case. My analogy is perfectly valid; it is <i>you</i> who ought be emabarrassed!",1245418006

If he brings in the business.  If he does a ""good"" design.  If he manages the client and responds to his calls.  If he pays you on time.  If he brings in clients that pay at the top end of the scale.  Then he might be worth 50%.<p>My impression is that your friend is trying to profit from your hard work.  I don't see the amount of time as being 50/50.  So you need to factor in whether his contribution is worth the 50%.  In my experience you'd pay 5% for an introduction.  15% - 25% for the invoicing, collecting, account management.  So really depends whether the design work is worth 35% or more.<p>Another arrangement is that you get back to him and say, that if he makes the introduction, you take on the client and pay him a commission of 15% and bill the design work to the client and keep 15% for admin costs.<p>A partnership or company is the last thing that I would suggest.  Too many things can go wrong over time.  Believe me, it took me 4 failed companies before I realised that it's impossible to reconcile expectations, especially when people have jobs, social life and other ever-changing issues in their lives.<p>Good Luck!",1245417597

That's what Spotify does, and I have absolutely no problem with that.<p>> It’s just a joke, but it makes a good point. How much is one song worth to you? How much is it worth to the author? How much is it worth to the recording industry?<p>I don't see this relates at all about the howler (""point"") regarding infinity dollars. In any case this is a confused mess passing for deep thought. How much is a song worth to you? However much you're willing to pay for it, I would have thought. How much is it worth to the author? However much he sold the rights to his music to the record industry for. How much is it worth to the music industry? Well, it's worth precisely the price they set for an album!<p>> ultimately you can always claim that a song never fully loses its value and it can therefore be set to an arbitrary, insanely high amount of money.<p>Another non-sequitor. My well-kept 1980s casio watch will never fully ""lose its value"". Would you like to buy it for USD 100,000.00, sir? And anyways, the claim can't be set ""arbitrarily"" high -- the law sets a limit of between USD 300 and USD 150,000 per song.<p>It is impossible to know the financial damage wrought by making a song available on a P2P network. However, it worth stating two points:<p>1. It is the <i>jury</i> that sets the amount of damages per song, not the plaintiffs. This should have been obvious to anyone who had actually read the court case, as the author claims to have done.
2. While it is impossible to determine a precise value for the damages, you <i>can</i> make a reasonable, conservative estimate based on the expected number of times a song has been downloaded once made available on P2P, what the expected price of said download would be if it were effected through legal channels, etc. It's not going to be perfect, but this is far from being ""arbitrary"".<p>Finally, the title of the article just reeks of demagoguery. Ever download a copyrighted song? You owe infinity dollars? Does the author take us for complete idiots?<p>I frankly don't understand why there's this rush to defend a woman who repeatedly lied about her activities. She could have settled for a reasonable sum. She instead had the chutzpah to claim that she never even knew about KaZaA despite having written a paper about Napster (her conclusion: it was legal). She lied about the hard drive she handed in for depositions. She, simply put, doesn't have a foot to stand on.

The £25/hr is more from fixed prices we figured we would have for the first few jobs (which are specced out) and their budget is fairly low.

817163,comment,817044,817044,0,0,nickyp,,,"Definitely contains interesting ideas.<p>But the problem with the lottery ticket mentality is that I think it mostly stems from the fact that the 'greedy and seedy suits' exert so much control over other peoples art on top of collecting all/most of the profits (even more so in the past).<p>Examples are ample:\nmusicians not owning the actual music (in the past not even owning the actual recording masters), not able to decide how/when to (re)release albums, directors/creators of movies not owning 'video rights' and as such not in charge of how crappy a DVD is put together, comic book artists/writers not even having control over a character they invented from scratch...<p>The only reason you would ever put up with such ...ahem... 'fascism' is that you get compensated beyond a 'living wage'.<p>Also: I don't equate control/copyright over your own art/work with being able to control weather someone can get a hold of your art without paying for it.<p>That kind of thinking is completely obsolete this day and age and again only serves one purpose: maximize profits by ripping of (cfr. Nine In Nails album pricing in certain countries) or pestering consumers (cfr.  DRM & unskippable 'do not steal' intros on DVD's you just bought)<p>Once the control problem goes away, new and equally profitable means of monetization can and should be created without feeling cheated (cfr. Radiohead In Rainbows)<p>We all know how it feels to work a job that has a crappy commute or crappy hours/people but \nhappily put up with it if you're compensated more than enough.<p>When it comes to losing control over your art, only billions are 'more than enough' it seems ;-)",1252668934

817146,comment,816715,816903,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Exactly. Whenever you read 'did not return message seeking comment' or 'could not be reached for comment' you really should read 'we try to make it seem like we tried but they didn't care in order to make ourselves more important'.<p>And it puts the pressure on the parties of who they 'request comment' to replay, knowing that if they don't that that dreaded sentence will be in the article, effectively a small component in the trial by media arena.<p>There are other examples of such code phrases but this one is particularly annoying.<p>As though everybody in the world should be at the beck and call of the media, and doing nothing is already a strike against you.<p>Sure, if a politician stonewalls on a subject call them out for it. But don't use that phrase every second article in order to make it seem that the media are something you ignore at your peril. Plenty of people are loathe to talk to reporters simply out of - justified - fear of being misquoted.",1252667580

817142,comment,817044,817095,0,0,steerpike,,,"Apparently you read a different article because I got the wandering part but I didn't get the 'many good points' part.<p>I'm sorry but the section you quoted is utterly fatuous, without any kind of figures to back it up. I could quite as easily say that the vast number of painters, poets, authors, actors, musicians and sculptors that I personally know would be estatic to be earning $75,000 a year (or equivalent depending on location). Especially since most of them are currently struggling on a minicule percentage of that amount year after year after year without any certainty that they will eventually be able to use the skills they've honed to pay their way in society.<p>As far as I can tell her entire argument seems to boil down to 'Art is special and people should give money to artists because it's special'. I'm not entirely sure how that can be taken as any kind of argument.<p>Art of any kind is a skill, it takes years of hard work and dedication to hone that skill. Her intimation that 'Art' is the domain of the muse and inspiration utterly ignores the enormous amounts of effort every single artist commits to honing their craft.<p>This kind of idiotic talk just makes me so damn furious. Segregating artists as some kind of 'special needs cases' that should rely on the goodwill of others in order to do normal things like want to raise a family or buy a house or pay for dinner out is a disgusting suggestion, not worthy of consideration.",1252667286

I'm not sure what we defeated or cause we moved forward, but it sure felt great!<p>Let's keep up the good work! We have a long list of horrible deeds done in the past to dead people by other dead people, and there's no limit to the amount of patting ourselves on the back we can achieve. After all, we are so morally superior to all of those folk, and it's time we told ourselves that.<p>Never mind that slavery still exists in the world, or imprisonment for gays, or genocide, or female genital mutilation. No point in addressing or doing something about actual, real evils that we can make an impact on. Nope! When you can score easy symbolic points, all of that real action seems kind of silly. Let's hear it for symbolism over substance! </sarcasm><p>As a person of European descent, I would like to take this opportunity to request that the Italian government apologize for the Romans keeping so many of our ancestors as slaves. This is a wrong that's gone on way too long, and something superficial and symbolic must immediately be done so that I can feel better about it.",1252667246

But they also had the power of a major university behind them, and they were able to hire a virtual army of brainpower.<p>People that want to get rich before they turn 30 are, for the most part misguided.<p>But some of them will make it.<p>And because to some extent you are in control of your destiny in this respect the feeling of achievement is a powerful drive. I know it drives me (even if I don't hope to make it before I'm 30, I'm well past that anyway ;) ).<p>So, we plod away on our little schemes to dominate the world, scoff at Gates and Jobs while admiring them.

168284,comment,168094,168125,0,0,jrockway,,,"> Effectively, this is about casually describing your work to random people and finding serendipitous connections to other projects or learning unexpected, but relevant information.<p>I work at home, but I find that IRC is a fine outlet for this.  There is a much bigger pool of people to draw from when you're talking about a worldwide network as opposed to a few people in your office.<p>The real problem is that when you work at home, it's very easy to go for days (or weeks) without talking to anyone in real life.  It's not bad in general (communicating on the Internet is not that different from communicating face to face), but it is difficult to meet girls :)  (To be fair, it was like that when I worked at a big company too.  I'm 22, everyone else was in their 40s.  I would rather be alone than to have to talk to those people :)",1208662051

168279,comment,168127,168127,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Really, as soon as Justin TV gets the video online, people should see it.  DHH's presentation really was the best of the bunch in my opinion, followed by San Altman's.<p>He really made a lot of sense.  There is so much talk and buzz about getting funded that it was really refreshing to hear some one talk about just plain starting a business.  The profit margins in the software business are very, very high.  If you can offer a decent product and get people to pay for it, you can make a rather nice living for yourself without having to play the funding game.",1208661186
168278,comment,167255,167255,0,0,mindcrime,,,"A nice, basic, simple (but not <i>easy</i>) way is this:<p>a. cut the gratuitously bad stuff out of your diet.  Drop sodas, chips, candy, etc.  If you eat fast food, get a grilled chicken sandwich and a salad instead of a double cheeseburger and fries.<p>B. add some exercise.  It doesn't have to be a lot, but what has worked well for me over the years is walking on a treadmill, and gradually upping the incline to increase the resistance as my conditioning improves; and/or increasing my speed or adding time to my sessions.<p>You'd be amazed how much weight you can lose if you walk on a treadmill for an hour at 3.5 MPH, with the incline set all the way up, 4-5 times a week.  Just be patient.  Trying to lose more than 2 lbs a week is probably not a good idea, and it takes some fairly hard work (see above) to lose even 2 lbs a week.",1208661118

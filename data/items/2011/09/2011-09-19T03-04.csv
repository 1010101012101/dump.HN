If Intel becomes a strong player in the mobile market, who do you think will benefit the most from it? Google? No. Microsoft. Because then they can get back to using x86 chips, while Google's doesn't gain much of anything, since competition in the ARM market was already strong enough, and Intel was far from ""necessary"".<p>Unless, Google's plan is to get Android on more x86 (older) machines, once the OS matures a bit more, and become a real OS choice for people using Windows today. But we'll see if that's their real plan, and if it is, how it will go.<p>Until then I still think Google's decision to help Intel take over the mobile market (if that's even possible at this point) will turn out to be a very bad decision for Android's future, as it will allow Windows a backdoor to get back on track.

What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is making money?</i><p>I'd offer this passage from Robert Wright's The Moral Animal as one answer. This assumes the distribution of wealth serves as a proxy (inexact, even inaccurate, perhaps, but functional) for the distribution of access to sexual resources among males:<p><i>Men have long competed for access to the scarcer sexual resource, women. And the costs of losing the contest are so high (genetic oblivion) that natural selection has inclined them to compete with special ferocity.</i><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=MuI_DVZ1Xo8C&lpg=PP1&dq=moral%20animal%20wright&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q=%22inequality%20amoung%20males%22&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=MuI_DVZ1Xo8C&lpg=PP1&#3...</a><p>So the argument goes something like this:<p>Material resources (wealth) provide access to sexual resources and reproductive success (any organism's raison d'etre). An organism hard-wired to persist its genes will probably also be hardwired to recognize the existential threat presented by unequal access to the resources required to persist its genes and take radical action to avoid it. Since among most animals (including humans), females make a greater biological investment, they enjoy the privilege of selecting among males,  preferring those with resources to best provide for their offspring, which puts males in the position of scrabbling to accumulate the resources necessary to win the affections of a mate.<p>That probably leaves out a few necessary premises, but if you're not familiar with the argument, hopefully you at least get the picture.<p>Wright makes the point that a society in which there is such radical inequality of wealth that a significant number of men have not the resources to attract a mate, settle down, and marry, also tend to be the most violent and unstable.<p>If you had a society in which there was radical inequality of wealth, but not radical inequality of access among young males to mates, you would expect less instability. But allowing for the shortcuts in reasoning that evolution might encourage, you'd still expect some. And as various behaviorial economic experiments have demonstrated, humans seem to have a tendency to reason about fairness in relative rather than absolute terms. So in such a society, you'd probably still have a greater threat of instability than one where there was a more equitable distribution of wealth -- and, especially, the perception of it.",1316401449

I'm not sure how that protects the mythical small inventor.<p>I mostly dislike that there is no move to make patents only defensive. Patent awards should be limited to only the cost of direct interference with the patent holder's business.<p>That would be the most sensible given the intended purpose of patents of defending an inventor in return for publishing the discovery.<p>Suing a business that has nothing to do with your own because it employs a similar solution logically is destructive to the economy, since their success does nothing to harm your own success. Patents should be limited to protect you against competitors who are in a zero-sum game for the same market.",1316401366

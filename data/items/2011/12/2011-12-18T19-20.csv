3367336,comment,3366526,3366859,3,0,rayiner,,,"So just to give you some background. In any Lisp, when you evaluate a list, the first element is treated as an operator, and the remaining items are treated as arguments. Moreover, there is no distinction between graphic characters or alphabetic characters for the purposes of defining variable names. So '+' is a valid name for a variable (which is bound to the addition function), and so is '+3'. So without the space, it thinks you are trying to call the function '+3' with the argument '3'.",1324238026

(In some problems, the sequential portion is roughly constant, independent of the amount of data.

Then app is more friendly to the group, and benefit is you don't overpay/overtip individually or as a group when maybe not thinking clearly when you settle.<p>You could even add a game element on who's paying the round, or based on random, ongoing bets, ??",1324237967

3367330,comment,3367048,3367297,7,0,sho_hn,,,"One of the tech pillars of KDE Platform 4.x is Nepomuk, a framework to store and query (via SPARQL) RDF triplets organized in standardized ontologies. This is used as the backend for Spotlight-like file metadata indexing, but also user-generated file metadata (comments, ratings), PIM data (people, messages) and various other relationship-y stuff. It's dev-accessible on the app level and seeing increased usage there over time, e.g. the Bangarang mediaplayer uses it for its media library.<p>As time goes on it will increasingly unify the notion apps have of ""people"" and associated data (conversations with them, content authored by them, etc.) across the desktop, among many other use cases for a generic metadata and relationships store.<p>Plasma Active allows you to set up ""activities"", which are separate workspaces with associated widgets, apps, documents, etc. and Nepomuk is used to store those associations, generate recommendations, and so on.<p>So no, it's not buzzword bingo.

3367320,comment,3367161,3367232,3,0,JimmyL,,,"I think your core assumption - that ""US citizens are always in the know - is optimistic (here's a survey to whet your thinking - <a href=""http://pewresearch.org/politicalquiz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pewresearch.org/politicalquiz/</a>). I think most Americans reading this site are, but we're not exactly a majority. There's a whole lot of people who don't live in the top-thirty cities in the country and don't have the time to spend a few hours a day reading up on politics. And even those who do, certainly don't have the background to have an informed opinion on <i>everything</i> that Government deals with. To pick an example at random, could you deliver informed comments and votes on issues relating to the work of the Bureau of Land Management in southern Utah, and how their grazing policies affect farmers? I know I couldn't.<p>The bottom line is that governing is hard, and doing is adequately requires a lot of knowledge about a lot of different things. Pick the Senate committee with the least-interesting sounding name - for me, that'd be the Subcommittee on Jobs, Rural Economic Growth and Energy Innovation or the Joint Committee on Printing - and try and watch a video feed of it in session for a few hours...the amount of things they have to deal with is amazingly broad, and way beyond the ability of any one person to capture (hence the importance of having a class of professional political staffers).<p>It's a similar reason why I'm in favor - generally - of lobbying. Is the way it's done now right? Not at all. But is there room in a well-run government for external subject matter experts with agendas? Certainly.<p>Lastly, I just don't think direct democracy works especially well. Check out California for the canonical example of what happens when you let people vote on complex issues in isolation of one another, with the information dumbed-down to target people who are willing to only budget an hour of their time per week on thinking about politics. Complex issues with national and international repercussions should be debated and decided by people who can study them in-depth and who represent a cross-section of the population, as opposed to those with the economic freedom to pick one or two to become involved with - I'm not saying that we have this now, but it's more what we need than a platform where OWS/Tea Party crowds can overwhelm a web vote on something.",1324237553

And that your behavior is common enough that somebody took the time to include it in a guide of lame responses to discussions of privilege. Do you see what's wrong with that?</i><p>I don't subscribe to the view that bringing female privilege into a discussion about male privilege is somehow off limits.  It's the reverse side of the same coin.  If women are victims because of male privilege, than men are victims because of female privilege.  You cannot examine one without the other.  I too can publish a guide saying that anyone that makes obvious arguments against my reasoning is ""lame"", but that does not make it so.  It is simply a tactic to steer the discussion and prevent the other side from ever being explored.<p>Refusing to examine both sides of an issue is narrow.  Shouting down anyone that dares examine the flip side with soft-minded reasoning is pathetic.  It is evidence of a weak argument, which is characteristic of feminism.  This faulty logic is how we have arrived at female-only health clubs while women were suing and legislating male-only golf clubs out of existence.",1324237231

Wouldn't regularly committing a crime in your day-to-day life preclude you from also being an effective police officer? That is, a doctor smoking doesn't have any real repercussions other than that they're not following their own advice. The law enforcement officer, however, violating the law seems to be not disobeying his own advice, but disobeying the rules that we as society have set forth. In effect, his actions impact his ability to act as an enforcer of the law. The doctor simply gives <i>advice</i>, the patient can always choose to ignore it with no external repercussions. By committing crimes, it seems that the officer is actually negligent in his duties and unfit for holding his office.<p>By the way, this isn't a statement about the occurrence, merely a statement about what ought to be (i.e., is vs. ought).

Maybe the big (and common) mistake the parent is talking about, though, is assuming that because a given programmer knows Blub but doesn't know Blam (generic language with some semantics either not supported, under-supported, or not often used in Blub), they will find the concepts in Blam strange and difficult to adapt to. They may already be familiar with a similar concept or even writing something like Blam-flavored Blub.<p>I'm a latecomer to the Ruby game, and have done a <i>lot</i> of PHP and JavaScript over the last 10 years (though those are far from the only languages I know and have worked in). It's been funny to see what kind of assumptions that means other devs make about what Ruby concepts are going to be big steps for me. I was told by some people that blocks would be a revelation and that metaclass manipulation would melt my brain. But blocks map pretty directly to the familiar concept of passing around functions, and metaclass hacking onto things present in Perl and JavaScript that I'd sometimes wished I'd had in PHP.<p>Similarly, Haskell and Erlang -- while significantly different from the languages I've used most of my professional life -- both feel pretty familiar after a long-ago stay in the land of Prolog.<p>I understand the impulse to assume you know something about a developer from the languages they claim proficiency in -- and the impulse to assume that devs who don't know the languages your revelations have come in haven't had those revelations. Generally, for example, I don't think particularly well of a lot of my fellow PHP devs. But when it comes time to make serious judgments like hiring, rather than asking them which languages they know, I want to look at whether they understand certain semantics at a language-independent level, I want to know what they like about the languages they know, what they'd add to the language if they could, and what they'd take away.",1324236359

There is plenty of evidence to support that, including the fact that FGM is considered a larger issue although it has effectively been eliminated in the west.<p>Consider this, if a father wanted to have his newborn daughters' clitoral hood removed because he didn't like the way it looked, he would be rightly ignored.  If a mother wants to have her newborn son circumcised because she doesn't like the way uncut penises look, he will be circumcised.  No matter how you want to slice it, both are genital mutilations.  The difference is, one is ridiculous, uncommon and illegal, and the other is ridiculous, common, legal, and widespread.<p><i>Female genital mutilation is pretty explicitly about controlling female sexuality in a way that makes women more obedient male property.</i><p>It does happen almost exclusively in Islamic areas, and some religious leaders do mandate it, so I'm not too sure about that.  In any case, religion is a poor reason to justify mutilation.  Circumcision was performed on male slaves to make them ""less likely to rape white women"", so I also am not too sure about the underlying reason for male circumcision.  Both practices seem kind of barbaric.<p><i>Circumcision, though, seems to be a religious thing from a very patriarchal culture. The modern justification for which is hygiene and/or health, and sometimes it's definitely medically necessary.</i><p>The hygiene and health arguments are bogus, and have been proven to be bogus.  If women were having parts of sexual organs removed for ""hygiene"" reasons, it would not continue for a moment.<p><i>So I'm not seeing how circumcision is evidence of a gender power differential.</i><p>The fact that nobody questions male circumcision which is forced on over 50% of males born in the United States today, while FGM, which is much less widespread largely occurring only in Africa and the middle east, garners considerable attention provides evidence of a power differential.  It clearly shows that male health issues are undervalued, even in relation to obscure female issues, reinforcing the matriarchal view that men are inherently less valuable than women.",1324236190

To deliver stored energy, the air comes out and is expanded, driving the motor/generator as a generator and generating electricity.<p>Our innovation captures the heat energy of compression (the majority of the energy in compressed air is stored in the form of heat) and allows us to regenerate from it almost all of it in the form of useful energy.<p>We do this by spraying a fine water mist directly into the compressing and expanding air. The high surface area and heat capacity of water rapidly absorbs the heat of compression, and delivers it during expansion, to be converted back into mechanical energy.",1324234881

This is good news but I'm surprised. This means people see great value in text mining but why? It's not intuitive how much data can be scrubbed from text. How do you even know it's doable. OK, someone is making money out of Twitter sentiment but that's done. What will you make?<p>Another question is if TextMinr.com is up to the task. Text mining is not like any other data mining. It MUCH more difficult. Google prediction API is just silly because there is no control over feature engineering, feature selection, instance selection, or model selection. This leaves a lot of untapped market for predictive modeling startups IF (big if!) the demand is for profit not for fun or not for academics.",1324234810

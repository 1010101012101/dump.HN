I assume that Steam prices will stay the same across OSs as well rather than charging more for a Linux version.<p>It's obvious that they are getting more interested in hardware such as the Oculus Rift, also with hardware getting cheaper there seems to be a growing market for people buying hardware/software integrated solutions.<p>Whatever it is they are planning to do, they want to become a first class player in the gaming market rather than being whim to Microsoft who look like they are wanting to produce their own hardware.<p>The best way to do that is to take an already proven kernel with good performance and no licensing and work on from there.<p>My guess is that porting Steam to Linux gives them an eager powerbase of vocal power users to use as a test market. It's the same principle Apple uses by marketing to the ""fanboys"" first and letting it trickle out from there.<p>Hopefully they will continue to support ""normal"" Linux distributions however, it would be nice to be able to hook up their controller and a headset to my PC and run everything that way if I don't want to buy a ""steambox"" or whatever.",1348732481

My father recently turned 70 and he has a PC at home which is used for listening to music, browsing and a lot of CAD. He started using computers much before I did, but he did not grow up with them and still finds it hard to deal with GUIs.

I am talking about ease, not efficiency.<p>And it is not that he's not a sharp cookie anymore. He runs the household, still consults on his civil engineering projects, tinkers frequently with various things electronic/electrical, but GUIs stump him and his predicament has only gotten worse with the newer iterations of operating systems. For my generation, who grew up with the modern computing paradigms, this is unfathomable, but it is a real problem too, one with no real solution.<p>I have found my eventual solution in doing Teamviewer sessions for most problems.

Digital Design and Logic Circuits\n7. Motors - Now this is tricky, as there are so many types of motors. But if you are interested only in digital, focud on DC , Servo and Stepper motors\n8. Sensors - Types, working, usage etc \n9. Microprocessors and Microcontroller\n10. Computer Architecture and Organization<p>I can go on, but I think it will be a few years for you to get to these.<p>The above mentioned track will get you started in Digital Electronics, for analog electronics you need to dive deeper into Power Electronics, AC Machines, etc.<p>I have also left out signal processing and communication topics.

Do not even try it at home without guidance.<p>For skills you need to acquire:\n1. Component Identification \n2. Breadboarding \n3. Electronic tools and devices - Wire cutting tools, stripping, soldering iron, de-soldering, heat gun, hotplate soldering. \n4.

This is masked, but consider these quotes:<p>""the FDA cant do anything about a harmful supplement until after it has been on the market and caused harm"" and ""...legislators [...] pounce, doing their best to kill or water down any legislation that strengthens the FDAs hand in removing potentially dangerous supplements.""<p>In other words, the FDA needs to do something about dangerous supplements before it has caused any harm.  But not just <i>actually</i> dangerous supplements, but <i>potentially</i> dangerous supplements too.  Well, anything new is <i>potentially</i> dangerous.  How would you prove something isn't actually dangerous?  A clinic trial, one supposes, at a cost of hundreds millions of dollars?  This would effectively outlaw the sale dietary supplements, none of which are profitable enough to make such a trial worthwhile.<p>So, the author wants to shift dietary supplements from ""food"" to ""drugs"", thereby destroying the industry.  But why?  What's so bad about the status quo, anyhow?  The author gives a few examples, but almost without exception they are issues which are already solved.  That scary story about the NJ factory?  Yeah, that's actually ALREADY ILLEGAL.  The owners WENT TO JAIL.  After being discovered by FDA inspectors, who ALREADY have the power to inspect factories.<p>So, uh...we have an example of something admittedly bad, which is already a crime, and which is already being monitored by the relevant government department, and the owners already went to jail over it, and this is a reason why we need a law change...why?<p>Next example, same deal.  An incorrectly made product poisoned hundreds of people.  If that's a reason to effectively destroy the industry, then god only knows what we should do poultry farmers after the various salmonella outbreaks over the years.  Shoot them, I guess?<p>And finally, to cap the entire piece...the author complains about the FDA not doing a good job of enforcing existing regulations.  Which is...an argument for giving them more regulations to enforce.  Uh....what?<p>It's like a politician running for election with the slogan ""hey, our team may have completely screwed up the economy, but that just means we know more about to fix it!""  Where I come from, serious failure on someone's part is not a good argument for increasing their role and responsibilities.",1348729249

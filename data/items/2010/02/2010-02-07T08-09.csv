If you have a look further up in this post people are suggesting this as far as I can see - e.g. 'It won't be long before all applications are written in HTML/CSS/JS.'<p>Why use a browser for content creation? Browsers are good for displaying text and graphics, but when it comes to creation sometime you're going to hit the wall - whether it's file size/memory limits/bandwidth limits.<p>What is the cut point for a browser app - There must be one. At the moment I'm editing and saving some movies I taped on my USB recorder to my PC, so I can watch them later. Will a browser ever be able to do this? it seems unlikely. My previous example about editing a large raw image - it seems unlikely a browser will do that. My day job is writing database apps, will a browser ever do that? seems unlikely, except for some of the front end stuff. So what are the things a browser can do? The more I think about it the smaller the class of applications is - whether it's using HTML 5, 6 or 112.<p>A browser app is good for
- little apps that aren't too resource intensive<p>- things that you'd like to access from multiple places (like email), but things like dropbox are way better for a large class - a web enabled native app<p>- reading web sites<p>- searching web sites<p>No matter which way you cut it, there is a class of applications that will <i>never</i> run on a browser. So the argument is where this cut point exists, not if it exists.<p>(and 99% of PC's could run this app if the people who owned those PC's could install an application called firefox, an application that is tuned for running this particular web enabled application that uses html 5 as it's file format)",1265530656

A more open policy on publishing - in detail - on the web can help them do so, they can crowd-source opinions and suggestions - really I don't see a downside to this.<p>Out of curiosity I spent over a week to find out the roots of experiments that determine the effect of CO2 on temperature, if the models took account of diffusion, which layer of the atmosphere is affected the greatest etc...

8302570,comment,8300432,8300432,11,0,personZ,,,"This article is a bit like postulating &quot;Why you might not eat steak for dinner&quot;, and then positing reasons that all orbits the assumption that steak is your default choice, and alternatives must therefore have extenuating circumstances. It is an absurd foundation.<p>Did the grocer get more commission selling you chicken? (sidenote: That commission bit appears in every conspiracy laden story about Android&#x27;s rise, despite having zero empirical evidence. Indeed, many carriers do more to market and pitch the iPhone than any other brand, implying something very different).<p>For most people now, smartphones are <i>largely</i> interchangeable. They really are. You have a browser, can make calls, can access Netflix and your fantasy football app and Facebook and Twitter, etc. An iPhone 6x versus a GS 5, for instance, to many users it is simply a wash. Apple has tried hard to lock people into an ecosystem (Facetime me? No, Skype or Hangouts me please), but those efforts have fallen by the wayside and are becoming more of a hindrance than a benefit.<p>So it comes down to marketing (you know, like having U2 and giving out albums to gain more attention for your keynote) and differentiating features. Apple tried with the &quot;true tone&quot; flash or whatever. HTC is trying the dual-lens camera. Others make their devices waterproof. And so on. It isn&#x27;t so clear.<p>Further, Ben Evans isn&#x27;t just a bit of an Apple fan boy -- he is a huge Apple fan boy, with compromised credibility outside of that circle. He got a taste of the Apple aficionado love so now he panders to it fullstop. And given that Evans loves pointing out the payout to developers (then, <i>absurdly</i> calculating per capita metrics because it sells his point), note that the Play Store payout is growing more quickly than the App Store is -- YoY growth in the most recent yearly period was 150%. At current rates the Play Store will payout more than Apple within a year. But of course they&#x27;re both very lucrative targets, and it would be folly to ignore either, and it&#x27;s bizarre that this metric even appears in a piece contemplating consumer choices.",1410443951
8302569,comment,8302542,8302542,1,0,frading,,,"Hello, I am the founder. I posted a while ago about Everytime already, but the app improved dramatically with time and is getting very good traction now.<p>Everytime was designed to solve one of my problems, which was organising all those moments I was finding interesting for current or future projects.\nI needed a way to keep track of moments in videos I was watching, so if I encountered a nice shot at 20:00, I could save it, add a description and it would be accessible anytime and sharable with my team.<p>So basically I needed a video player with bookmarking and note-taking capabilities. This is what Everytime is.<p>It integrates with Vimeo, Youtube or Soundcloud but also VLC (using the desktop app: <a href=""https://www.everytimehq.com/desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.everytimehq.com/desktop</a>) so you can bookmark moments in videos on your computer.<p>It is particularly tailored for filmmakers (directors, screenwriters, concept artists, directors of photography) as they can gather and share references easily, creating a more dynamic discussion and brainstorming.<p>There are other use cases where video publishers can distribute videos with richer content with our widgets (<a href=""https://www.everytimehq.com/widgets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.everytimehq.com/widgets</a>).<p>Finally, we have a free demo available from the front page, so you can try it out easily: <a href=""https://www.everytimehq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.everytimehq.com</a><p>TLDR: Everytime helps you save moments in any media.",1410443931

It was an Android because at the time an iPhone meant AT&T, and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with their network.<p>Two years ago I bought my second smartphone.  It was an Android because inertia and also because at the time iOS was really a bit behind Android in terms of things like notifications and useful o/s features.<p>I also bought my first tablet a little more than two years ago. It was an android because Apple didn&#x27;t have a small tablet then (and because my phone was an android).<p>I&#x27;m going to get a new smartphone soon.  And you know what?  It&#x27;ll be an Android.  Yes, Apple has at this point addressed all the things that pushed me to Android.  I could get an iPhone on any network. The o/s has caught back up.  They have a small tablet now.  But at this point, why would I change?  Every time I use an iOS device, in bothered by a ton of small details -- they aren&#x27;t really flaws, just things that don&#x27;t work the way I expect.  What&#x27;s the upside?  I like Android now.  If they had had all those features from the start, it would have been a different story.<p>The flaw in this article is that it presumes that there is a large population of people who are just waiting for that one important feature to come to iOS so they can finally ditch Android.

8302557,comment,8292476,8296530,1,0,graycat,,,"> It feels as if you&#x27;re just using the story to see your own preferences confirmed.<p>In part, right.<p>> For all you know from the facts as displayed by the story that was a perfect family and the dad never knew he made the woman pregnant.<p>Strictly speaking, yes.  But we have to expect that usually the man will know if the woman he had sex with did get pregnant.  E.g., legally he can be on the hook for supporting the child until she/he is 18.  Also if the couple was intimate enough to conceive a child, then typically they are also intimate enough to communicate that they did conceive a child.<p>> In fact, if there is one thing that you can take away from this story it is that mere information was capable of destroying one of those homes full of love you&#x27;re going on about without either partner ever breaking their marriage vows.<p>Strictly speaking, yes.  But the story is not very complete in the details, e.g., we don&#x27;t have dates.  So, a guess from the story is that the child discovered was the result of adultery within the marriage; indeed, otherwise there was relatively little reason for the discovery to break up the marriage.<p>Whatever did happen when, adultery or not, that the marriage did break up does indicate that at least one of the partners cared a lot about the issue of the so far unknown child; that is, someone really cared a lot about, if you will, &#x27;traditional family values&#x27; whether there was actual adultery or not.<p>Yes, some relationships can be both not casual and broken up.  But one of the main reasons for a relationship is &#x27;commitment&#x27; where both partners believe that with their relationship they have a long-term, not just a 24 hour, solution to &#x27;the fundamental problem of life&#x27;, doing something effective about feeling alone.  Then, being <i>casual</i> about a relationship ending shows too little understanding of much of the reason for a relationship, that is, knowing that have the problem of being alone solved for 24 hours, 48 hours, a week, a month, a year, a decade, for life.  Indeed, lots of details in our legal system are to this end thus indicating that some people value such commitment.  Or, a relationship should not be like a car that just trade in on a new model -- pun intended.  Such a trade in has to suggest that the origin of the relationship involved a lie, that is, a false claim or suggestion that there was love in the sense of commitment.  Indeed, some people who pursue and defend casual sex do admit that one of the main issues is not lying, that is, being clear that the sex is just casual, say, like playing a game of ping pong, and not a commitment for the future.<p>For your last paragraph, why did the information destroy the home if there was no adultery and, really, the father was not aware of the pregnancy?  So, since the home did break up, I have to suspect that there was some deception involved, either adultery or at least just deliberate lack of communications, that is, deliberate concealment.  Such poor communications is a lack of <i>intimacy</i> and, thus, a lack of <i>intimate love</i> and, thus, a bad biggie for the relationship.  Or, as in E. Fromm, the couple is supposed to <i>give knowledge of themselves to each other</i>, if you will, take all their clothes off between their ears.<p>I have to return to my broad view:  Casual sex isn&#x27;t; sex is serious; really there&#x27;s no such thing as casual sex.  I&#x27;m pleased that some others see something at least similar.",1410443866

So the reaction has nothing to do with the products themselves, the rage is on a theoretical level, &quot;I don&#x27;t want government intruding in my private choices.&quot;  But they already do this in a gazillion different ways, bigger, more important intrusions.  The difference is that those are invisible.

Because &quot;some other omnipotent entity&quot; allowed them to exist.  How do you know that Entity can be trusted?  Because it even tries to ban silly things like Buckyballs and soda.

But in reality I just don&#x27;t see people clamoring for something like this.

I mean, digital music, smart phones, etc. all existed before Apple produced iTunes and the iPhone, but nobody marketed it correctly or provided exactly what people were looking for like Jobs and Apple. I just don&#x27;t think people who can pull that off come along very often, and I don&#x27;t think Apple has anyone (at least not facing the public) that can match what Steve did.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Jobs would be trying to produce a watch...I might consider what Jobs did and think he might have moved over into self driving cars or something like that.

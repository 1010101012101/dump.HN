Cantilever gates slide, but dont use a ground track. Instead, the gate is suspended above the ground. Its quieter than a sliding gate with a track and is great for slopes. However, Denver fence companies caution that cantilever gates dont do well in windy conditions, and require a lot of space beyond the gateway.<p>Tracked sliding gates need embedded rails the width of the gateway for bottom gate wheels. They work better in high wind situations, but require clean tracks for optimum operation. Denver fence companies install swing gates that open like a regular door and usually swing in, so they need dedicated space for opening.

6368652,comment,6366455,6366455,3,0,johncagula,,,"short summary: Quantum teleportation works by taking advantage of entanglement.  To teleport a quantum state, you prepare a source qubit and another pair of entangled qubits.  One of the pair is sent to your teleportation destination.  You take your source qubit and interact it with the one remaining entangled qubit. (this interaction depends on the paradigm of quantum computing you are using, i.e. apply a Hadamard gate to the photonic system) Once you have performed the interaction, you can measure the destination qubit and its state will inform you of the original state of the source qubit.  The destination qubit can be arbitrarily far away, thus &quot;teleportation&quot; has occurred.<p>This new thing in this study is that they use a &quot;hybrid technique&quot; to increase the efficiency of this transformation over 100x.  With older techniques, the teleportation transformation occurred according to a probability distribution such that transport fidelity was not always high.  This new technique apparently surpasses that barrier so that the teleportation is correct each time.",1378921451

ARM&#x27;s 32-bit instruction set is a bit odd, and the better 64-bit one will give a decent speed boost.<p>The ability to expand the address space beyond 4GB is nice, although not yet killer. The device still doesn&#x27;t have enough RAM to need it, surely, but it still lets you do interesting things like memory map large files or play other fun address space games.<p>In addition to that, 64 bits also lets Apple make various improvements on their end, such as adopting tagged pointers (already seen on 64-bit Mac), which can be a big performance and memory win for certain kinds of code.<p>What 64-bit doesn&#x27;t do:<p>1. Make code vastly faster. The performance increase will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-20%, not the huge gain some people seem to think. Some code could end up being slightly slower due to not doing anything that benefits from the new architecture while using up more memory and cache due to larger pointers, although this probably won&#x27;t happen often.<p>2. Allow qualitatively different things to be done with the devices. For example, the linked article implies that fingerprint recognition and VPNs are both made possible by the 5S&#x27;s 64-bitness, neither of which is even remotely true. Fingerprinting might be a bit slower without it, but not much. VPNs have been on iPhones for years, and 64 bits makes nearly no difference there, as CPU load isn&#x27;t high for network-limited crypto anyway.<p>3. Make code easier to port or more compatible. For any halfway decent halfway modern code, the 32/64 divide is not a big deal at all. Maintaining a code base that works in both 32 and 64 is trivial.<p>4. Signal anything about future iOS/Mac convergence at Apple. A 64-bit CPU in an iPhone was inevitable. It&#x27;s pretty much required once you want to go beyond 4GB of RAM, and extrapolating forward, iPhones will hit that limit soon. The only surprise (and let&#x27;s not downplay it, it was a pretty big surprise) is that it happened <i>now</i>, and there&#x27;s no real difference in terms of hypothetical Apple plans between a 64-bit ARM in 2013 and a 64-bit ARM in 2015.",1378920757

The you get the slightly counter-intuitive result that the diagonal line actual has the <i>same number of pixels</i> as the vertical line, and thus will produce the same density of points on the circumference. However, this line of reasoning would require that we know the lines are far enough apart that they don&#x27;t overlap pixels.",1378920747

First there is the width of the address bus determining how much memory and I/O ports you can address - 32 bit buy you a maximum of 4 GiB, 64 bit a whole lot more, 16 EiB, that is 16 million TiB.<p>The other thing is the width of the registers determining the maximum size of the numbers you can process with a single mathematical or logical operation. The register width is also related to the addressable memory space because you have to store your memory addresses somewhere but this is not a hard relationship - you can stuff all kind of mapping logic between the registers and the address bus or combine several smaller registers to form a wider address - but it is quite common that the register width and the address bus width match.<p>Beyond more addressable memory you gain not that much. If you write your code carefully with no dependency on the bit width of the processor the compiler will happily perform the necessary transformations to make your code run even if you perform 64 bit math on a 8 bit processor.

The Visible Ops Handbook is where devops as a movement, seems to have begun. But Devops is really about taking things like ITIL standards more seriously. It is unfortunate that too many people aim for buzzword compliance with any published standard, without looking for the essential meaning of the standard and adapting that to their own environment. Therefore a lot of stuff on the net about ITIL is crap, but the essential principles and practices that ITIL documents, are necessary for any serious Internet service company. And part of that is that software developers have to be involved in engineering how their apps are deployed and operated and CHANGED. No more silos between ops/sysadmins and developers. In the ideal end game of devops, there would be no more ops/sysadmin roles, just software developers, some of whom specialize in maintaining/improving site reliability. If you are in ops then you need to learn professional software development practices (Bob Martin&#x27;s book Clean Code comes to mind) and if you are a developer, it means that you need to learn more about managed processes (human processes) and about the architecture of the things that run your code. You have heard of cores, but what about L1 cache and false sharing? How much time does your app spend waiting on locks? Why don&#x27;t you know the answer to that last question? How do you measure/monitor your apps? If you answered Nagios, go back to school. Uptime is irrelevant, it is application health that matters, resource utilization and so on. Send data to Graphite to build up a historical view of your app behavior. If there is too much data being generated then use statsd or metricsd to only send a random sample of the data, because &quot;too much&quot; is a code for &quot;a random sample would be statistically significant therefore I don&#x27;t need all the data points&quot;.",1378920176

I would add that there are two other components, which are the Dunning-Kruger effect, and a variation of the typical mind fallacy. Impostor syndrome happens when you:<p>1. Are knowledgeable enough about a subject that you understand how little you know, compared to how much there is to know,<p>2. Are treated as an expert because of this knowledge, and<p>3. Assume that other people treated as experts would have a similar experience, and would only act confident if they really did know a large proportion of what there was to know.<p>#3 is of course incorrect; impostor syndrome becomes <i>worse</i> as your knowledge gets deeper and more specialized. Instead of seeing your knowledge meter fill up, you see the meter expand as you realize how much more there is to know. And you see new, empty meters popping up next to it, which you feel should be at least <i>partially</i> full to consider yourself an expert. These meters reveal themselves because you have the learned basis to understand that the field they represent even exists.<p>So when you mostly encounter experts who project confidence, you assume that it is because their knowledge meters are full. In reality, it is most commonly because they really have very little knowledge, and so to them the meter seems almost full. For the rest of them who are actually knowledgeable, it is because they have learned to project confidence with practice, and/or learned to keep things in perspective.<p>And of course most experts aren&#x27;t very knowledgeable - once you think about it, it would be shocking for the world to look any other way. But if you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> an expert in their specific field, they will still know more than you do. And since your knowledge meter for that field is short, you will feel like the knowledge they demonstrate is close to filling it up.<p>Finally, it doesn&#x27;t help that most of the experts we &quot;encounter&quot; are either in fiction, or are being presented in formats where any lack of confidence would be completely obscured. You can account for that rationally all you like, but your monkey brain is still going to integrate it into your emotional concept of an expert.",1378920128

One thing that I figured out rather quickly is that lispers really want to teach and explain things, but being lazy programmers, they don&#x27;t bother holding your hand, so if you are willing to do your homework, you&#x27;ll have an amazing time with lisp.<p>Lets take a look at a few patterns I&#x27;ve noticed:<p>* Newbie posts some snippet and asks for review, the snippet is C++ code written in CL, lisper tells him it sucks, newbie explains that he has a lot of C++ experience and this is how his brain works. Lispers(now plural) explain to him that lisp must be learned with a beginners mind and he must forget C++ temporarily in order to learn it properly. Newbie gets insulted for some reason and begins arguing.<p>* newbie asks question about &quot;generic lisp&quot;, lispers explain that the question makes no sense, and give his an answer about common lisp. Newbie asks question again emphasizing that he isn&#x27;t interested in Common Lisp but in lisp in general, lispers tell him to read the topic, #lisp is about Common Lisp. Newbie argues that #lisp should be about generic lisp, and #commonlisp or whatever should be about CL, argument goes nowhere of course.<p>* newbie asks question and posts snippet. The code is obviously written by somebody with exactly 1 hour of lisp experience(parens are mismatched and aligned wrong, indentation is horrible, not to mention the obvious hacks). lispers explain that lisp is best learned patiently and not through the &quot;learn x in y minutes&quot; way, and that he should read Practical Common Lisp. Newbie gets insulted he was told to RTFM instead of getting an actual answer to his &quot;wrong&quot; question(at least in the eyes of us lispers).<p>* newbie asks about scheme/emacs and refuses to accept that #lisp isn&#x27;t about those languages, see pattern #2.<p>* newbie asks scheme vs CL vs clojure vs haskell vs python vs ... question. Gets surprised when lispers unapologetically proclaim CL the best language ever and everything else is shit. Lispers do not hide their bias. Newbie then begins to argue about <i>his</i> favorite language and why it is better than lisp. Sometimes it&#x27;s clojure, sometimes its scheme, or it could be whatever.<p>* (my favorite, and probably most frequent) Newbie asks what is lisp good for, gets pissed off when we tell him we program computers with it :)<p>Many other such questions include:<p>Q: &quot;why isn&#x27;t lisp popular&quot; A: You haven&#x27;t converted enough people to it :)
Q: &quot;Why does lisp have so few libraries&quot; A: You haven&#x27;t written enough libraries yet :)
Q: &quot;Why isn&#x27;t there a library for X&quot; A: Nobody needed it, if you do, write it and push it to github :)
Q: &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t library X do Y&quot; A: patches welcome.<p>Notice a pattern :)<p>All of these cases or variations of them have happened many times since I started to frequent #lisp, often times the word &quot;fags&quot; or &quot;cunts&quot; get used, and not by lispers.",1378920003

6368479,comment,6364481,6367224,6,0,saurik,,,"> Attempting to recover from OOM is almost always a bad idea, which is why Chrome terminates processes by default on OOM.<p>You are thinking inside of &quot;the box&quot; that the only resource manager is the OS and the only resource in question here is virtualized memory. Yes: I entirely agree with the security advantages of letting OOM kill a process. My argument is that there is something wrong if my web browser allows untrusted code to attempt to load a 16GB large bitmap (65,535 x 65,535 RGB) and that that is simply allowed to crash a large number of unrelated tabs, including my e-mail client (which has now died on me way too many times due to other tabs).<p>Heap memory is what is causing the kill, but it isn&#x27;t the allocation of the heap memory from the OS for this bitmap that is the semantic problem in this situation: there should be other resource limits that apply much earlier that keep a tab from loading a 16GB large bitmap; some of these resource limits I will even say the browser already is in a position to track (such as specifically, the amount of space available in the disk cache). It isn&#x27;t about recovering from malloc(16GB): it is about avoiding that malloc.<p>My argument then is that the browser is a virtual machine that is allowing largely-untrusted turing complete code to run on my computer. These programs have tons of limits associated with them: one of them should be a VM object heap space limit, exactly as Java applets have. Java doesn&#x27;t die when it hits OOM, it kills itself when it hits its heap space limit. There may still be ways that the process can end up exhausting available RAM, and in those cases yes: the OS should still kill the process.<p>You might think this is limiting (&quot;but what about my amazingly great and large webapp?&quot;), but it isn&#x27;t: most web pages people browse to that use a lot of memory are really just using very large images. If they actually have a large number of JavaScript objects in play they should probably have to get a memory limit increase warning, exactly like they do if they want more HTML5 localStorage. Such large applications might also be Chrome Apps anyway, and can have manifest configuration.<p>But for all those web pages that have a lot of large data assets, like images, this problem should be being solved by the disk cache: resource limits should cause images to be unloaded from RAM and potentially pinned in the disk cache (so that they can&#x27;t be deleted until that tab is closed). If the disk cache finally can&#x27;t take the situation and needs to delete resources being used by tabs (that can&#x27;t just be yanked due to HTML semantics), then the page (not the tab) can be sacrificed.<p><i>Not even the entire tab should not crash because one page wants to load a very very large bitmap, much less a bunch of unrelated tabs.</i> This is not a &quot;crash&quot; scenario: this is a virtual machine that had some of its data evicted. The browser is already modeling individual web pages in ways where it can throw them away as a group: if the disk cache refuses to store something, that machine should be killed, much like the OS kills processes that want memory that can&#x27;t be backed by swap.<p>Even without such amazing resource limits, the way a massive resource should be handled is that it gets streamed to the disk cache (and if the disk cache refuses to hold it, it should just be denied) and then memory mapped (so the pages for it will page back to the file, and don&#x27;t cause memory pressure). There is simply no reason why the browser should ever be trying to allocate 16GB of private memory for purposes of loading a bitmap: that&#x27;s clearly far on the other side of absurd ;P.<p>To be clear: I am not saying &quot;Chrome should already be doing all of this&quot;; I am simply arguing that claiming this is impossible, or even impractical, is wrong, and that the current solution doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping (despite the wide-spread belief, and even occasional claim, that it does).<p>> As for how Chrome&#x27;s process sharing works, it&#x27;s opener based for Web content. ... This means the process is shared in cases where the HTML standard explicitly requires that the child browsing context be able to navigate the parent opener or frame. So, at that point, required Web functionality achieves an equivalent to the DoS you mention.<p>Which means that if I have an attack against Chrome and I want access to your e-mail data, I simply get you to click a link that opens your e-mail client target=&quot;new&quot;. It will almost certainly be running in the same process, and then I use my exploit, steal your data, and upload it back to my server. The result of this way of dividing processes means that the attacker has nearly complete control over which websites will be in the same process when it comes time to exploit Chrome.<p>> Process sharing can also be triggered when resource limits are reached or during page transitions, but that&#x27;s rarely a significant factor in practice and not controllable by a Web site.<p>The fact that I can&#x27;t control this isn&#x27;t terribly important, because I have complete control over process isolation from the previous paragraph. However, for completeness, I will point out that this decreases (slightly) the probability of the direct attack &quot;steal data from saurik&#x27;s e-mail&quot;, but does nothing to mitigate the more general attack &quot;steal sensitive information from saurik&quot;, because the result of resource limitations means that sensitive websites end up distributed through every single tab process over time. You can&#x27;t be guaranteed of hitting my e-mail client (as in the previous paragraph), but you can get <i>something juicy</i> from any of my processes.<p>> And to be very clear, Chrome&#x27;s process isolation is far from security theater. ... It also allows Chrome to entirely isolate different classes of renderer processes from each other, such as those used for Web content versus filesystem, extensions, apps, or system settings.<p>Sure. I am only talking about the separation of tabs into multiple processes. Having actual privilege separation, where certain types of things can&#x27;t be done by just any process, is certainly advantageous. However, having my tabs in separate processes, when the tabs have control over what web page content is in that process, and can even open new tabs that are associated with the same process, is &quot;security theater&quot;: it is billed as a security feature, but it is barely a speed bump.",1378919950

6368475,comment,6366912,6366912,69,0,grellas,,,"Lawyering in general, and business lawyering in particular, is an art in which good judgment counts a lot more than mere technical precision.<p>From a lawyer perspective, a written contract may have all sorts of areas in which it falls short of an ideal in capturing all key issues potentially affecting a client. There are recitals (defining factual context), covenants (setting forth promises), conditions (defining when an obligation kicks in), and (often) representations and warranties (defining the extent to which parties stand behind what is purporting to be sold, etc.). In <i>any</i> of these areas, a lawyer can potentially find things that are inconsistent with what a client says the deal is supposed to be. Sometimes this happens because of unequal bargaining power, where a big company essentially presents a host of oppressive boilerplate terms and conditions as &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; items. Other times, it happens because of what I call &quot;slicko&quot; tactics by the other party, where something that appears to say &quot;x&quot; in fact has a legal meaning of &quot;not x&quot; owing to the use of weasel wording and the like. Still other times, it happens because entrepreneurs are trying to cobble together their own contract by picking and choosing what sounds good from others they have seen and, in the process, failing to ensure that things don&#x27;t conflict with each other or perhaps just omitting to address key legal issues by having put an exclusive focus on the business issues. Finally, it can come about simply because of either poor drafting by a lawyer on the other side or simple attempts by a party to overreach.<p>When you see this as a lawyer, what do you do about it?<p>First, the final say on such issues belongs to the client and not to the lawyer. So, after a high-level assessment, you talk with your client, explain the general range of issues and problems, and get direction on the desired level of response. Is the deal such as even to warrant legal review? Is it to be a high-level review only, just enough to let the client know what key risks exist and to address only egregious things that go to the heart of the deal? Is it to be comprehensive to try to catch and fix everything that is even potentially material, even if it deals only with issues that are highly unlikely to arise? Or is it to be something in between? This need not be an elaborate discussion and often takes only a few minutes. But it is vital to the process because it lets the client make an informed choice about how to proceed with the legal review.<p>Having gotten client direction, it is still important in all but mega-deals to keep a sharp practical focus in doing a review. What good is it to do a scorched-earth review and markup if the result will be overkill that is likely to alienate the other side (some lawyers who do this do deserve to be called deal-killers)? It really is <i>poor</i> business lawyering simply to proceed unthinkingly and one-dimensionally in every case to review and mark up <i>everything</i> no matter how remote the risk or how likely it is to be material.  There is a dynamic to negotiations and nothing galls the parties more than to have to sort through a lot of lawyer comments over what they see as non-essential points for their deal.<p>On the other hand, it never pays arbitrarily to cut corners in doing a review. Just because a client says &quot;spend no more than an hour on this&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean a proper review can be done with such bounds. If a lot is at stake, and a client is just being penny-wise and pound-foolish, it is better not to do the review at all than to gloss over all sorts of serious problems in the name of economy.<p>The lesson from this piece, to me, is that entrepreneurs can do well in keeping a sharp eye on the practicalities of managing their business opportunities and they should not let lawyers get in the way of that. A related lesson, in case a lawsuit ever did result on signing any complex contract blindly, is that entrepreneurs can act foolishly in casually inviting lawsuits by failing to manage the legal review process at all and simply signing complex contracts as is. The net of this is: use your lawyers in proper cases but make sure to use lawyers who have a good practical focus in addition to legal skill and then manage that relationship to get what you need from the services for your deal. In any deal that really matters, it is usually a mistake to proceed without lawyers and it is an equally big mistake to give the lawyers sole discretion in how to do the project. Be proactive and smart in this, just as you would be in making any other business decision.",1378919906

Apple worked on the iPhone and iPad for years before they were released. In fact Apple started on the iPad before the iPhone.<p>Secondly, if there&#x27;s too many changes too quickly any impact each may have is lessened. If in 2007 after releasing the iPhone Apple&#x27;s management said &#x27;Right, we&#x27;ve done this touch screen stuff. Let&#x27;s come up with a different interface method&#x27;, the iPhone (and touchscreen computing in general) would not be the force it is today.<p>Implications of each change need time to sink in and be explored properly.<p>Thirdly, it&#x27;s not how Apple works. They come up with a new product category once or twice a decade and iterate on it annually year until it becomes mature.<p>Fourthly, who knows what else Apple&#x27;s been working on over the last few years? The attitude assumes that there&#x27;s nothing more going on, that some of the world&#x27;s brightest people with practically unlimited resources are just watching cat videos all day.<p>Now Apple may well be done innovating, but for the author to say that without any actual knowledge seems hasty, and more like he&#x27;s disappointed he didn&#x27;t get a pony.",1378919411

Or anyone here who knows firsthand from Google?<p>Just because, if I were writing a search engine, I would already have a bunch of &quot;AI&quot;/heuristics logic to tease these things out, since most sites don&#x27;t use semantic HTML5 -- and it would probably do a solid job, since it&#x27;s easy to compare a bunch of pages from a single site and figure out what parts are changing.<p>Then, if I actually started assuming that <main> or <article> was always the main/article part, it makes it easier for people to &quot;game&quot; the search engine with keyword-stuffing, etc. So, if I ran a search engine, I&#x27;d probably just ignore them completely and rely on my own heuristics.<p>(For example, Google completely ignores HTML language attributes: &quot;Keep in mind that Google ignores all code-level language information, from lang attributes to Document Type Definitions (DTD). Some web editing programs create these attributes automatically, and therefore they arent very reliable when trying to determine the language of a webpage.&quot; [1] So I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if semantic HTML is the same deal.)<p>I&#x27;ve heard it endlessly repeated that semantic HTML helps SEO, and that&#x27;s why you should use it. But I&#x27;ve never seen concrete evidence of this -- is there anything that actually backs it up?<p>[1] <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/03/working-with-multilingual-websites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/03/working-w...</a>",1378919314

6368401,comment,6366452,6366778,12,0,breckinloggins,,,"> Does this make sense?<p>Are you asking &quot;Is it possible that purely functional programming is yet another paradigm that, like OOP, is fantastically useful but is still destined to be the square peg that is forced into too many round holes?&quot;<p>If so, then yes, you&#x27;re making sense.  And yes, that&#x27;s probably what will happen.  However, as with OOP, the end result should be a net gain in knowledge and maturity for our very young field and yet another wonderful tool in our tool box.<p>Having said that, I think that with the &quot;functional wave&quot; comes a bit more understanding that this, too, may not be the perfect fit for every problem.  Look at Clojure: they try hard to give you mutability in terms of abstractions that seem to encapsulate what it means for mutability to be a valuable thing.<p>In Haskell, monads are a great model of &quot;what it means to be imperative&quot;.  If you think of imperative programming as:<p><pre><code>    setup();
    goLeft();
    stop();
    lookAround();
    pickUp(ball);
    turnAround();
</code></pre>
Then monads try to make precise just what exactly those semi-colons are doing. To me, the fact that this is hard to understand is mainly the result of the language being the playground of mathematicians who have long since forgotten why such concepts are hard.<p>In other words: there is a &quot;meta paradigm&quot; going on here and it&#x27;s just starting to emerge.  That meta-paradigm is to provide a language that gives you the abstractions to build the right abstractions to ultimately build the star-shaped peg that fits into the star-shaped hole.<p>So yes, if you&#x27;re taking the long view then Clojure might be <i>too</i> opinionated for your tastes (and I have in fact opined on another thread today about what it would take to back slightly away from that lofty perch), then it sometimes can look like yet another oversold silver bullet language.  But in the long term, we seem to be converging on something much healthier than the &quot;stop using that paradigm and start using this one because it solves everything!&quot; approach of the past.",1378919261

If you spend 10 hours, you might get something that meets the standards of good representation but still leave a few avenues unexplored. If you spend 20 hours, you might be able to explore those avenues and assure yourself that there are no risks lying there. If you spend 30 yours, you might just be gouging on tangentially related issues.<p>But you have a classic agency problem. It&#x27;s in the lawyers interest to spend 20 hours, both because it increases hours and because that minimizes his chance of being wrong. It&#x27;s probably in the client&#x27;s interest to go for the 10 hour solution, because whatever risk is created by those unexplored avenues is likely outweighed by the extra time and cost.<p>Importantly, the threshold of risk is lower for the lawyer than for the client. Say one of those unexplored avenues requires delaying some deal by 2 days. That delay may be monetarily inconsequential to the client but is stinging for the lawyer because has advice has been found wanting, and that jeopardizes the client relationship.",1378919247

They bought into the operating system, and that&#x27;s what drove sales of other Apple products from then on, because after all, that iPhone/iPod works better with a Mac.<p>Fast-forward to now, Apple&#x27;s competitor isn&#x27;t MS Windows.  It&#x27;s Android, which doesn&#x27;t cost a premium the way Windows did, and is arguably not inferior to iOS.<p>OS X was more &quot;open&quot; compared to Windows, and not just due to its Unix underpinnings.  It didn&#x27;t come with pre-packaged software and DRM restrictions, but it did come with better software.  It didn&#x27;t force you to consume content the Microsoft way, it embraced developers creating great apps like VLC without charging them.<p>No more.  iOS is a walled garden, even more so than Windows ever was.  Sure Google isn&#x27;t a saint in that regard, and yet Android encourages competition.  It has no issue with Amazon&#x27;s Kindle app selling e-books.  It has no issue with developers writing apps to replace &quot;core functions&quot;.  It knows that selling 10 units with a 10% margin is better than selling 1 unit with a 20% margin.  It&#x27;s thinking long-term.<p>I still love Apple for its design and attention to product detail, but if their greed and hubris continues to escalate, history may just repeat itself.",1378918948

6368361,comment,6366452,6366452,2,0,geuis,,,"I want to take a leap and talk about 2 core concepts that I got after spending last week learning Clojure. I&#x27;d love some comments about them.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing javascript for years but functional programming didn&#x27;t make sense until I realized:<p>1) It&#x27;s essentially inverted callbacks. You can read and reason about your code by working from the inside out. The results of a function are passed up to the outside.<p>2) When you stop modifying variables and just pass them around, it becomes a lot easier to think about code in abstract ways. There are of course some situations where modifying a variable is needed, but it really feels icky and you think twice about doing it.<p>The problem I found trying to learn this stuff is that once you learn to think functional its hard to think like someone who doesn&#x27;t get it. That makes it hard to translate concepts in ways that non-functional people can get easier. I&#x27;m keeping mental tabs on ideas as I understand them to hopefully help with this problem.<p>Also, macros. Clojure people love talking about them. They aren&#x27;t explained well most of the time though.<p>Simplest explanation is that you can write a bunch of your own functions, even ones that will override native functions, i.e macros. Since clojure is a compiled language, at compile time all the source code gets read in and pre-processed. When the compiler reaches some code that was defined in a macro, it keeps rewriting that code until all the macros are processed and the code has been re-written. Then everything is compiled to bytecode for the jvm.",1378918908

Except for the question of the presence of life Venus is a much more exciting planet to study, with thick atmosphere with high-speed winds and it&#x27;s shrouded surface. It might be suitable for human colonization too — at 50 km altitude the gravity, pressure and temperature are almost the same as on Earth. Also, most of the missions were Soviet, so it might be that USSR wanted to secure the lead in Venus exploration.",1387857530

There&#x27;s no value judgement here, it&#x27;s just not their job to write and maintain good software. Just as it&#x27;s not a mathematician&#x27;s job to maintain a cryptographic protocol or a physicist&#x27;s job to keep a satellite in orbit. The people who went to schools with strong research programs are trained by people in that mindset.<p>It&#x27;s a simple question of motivation. If they&#x27;re brilliant and they have motivation, then of course they could write great software. They just don&#x27;t.<p>Make no mistake, people from schools like Cal Poly SLO (a state school, and my alma mater) who excelled in their CS programs can software engineer circles around most. Why? Because Cal Poly has no research program, three quarters of their faculty come from industry, and their faculty have no job requirements outside of teaching. They literally had us managing five to ten thousand line software projects with teams of students in year two.",1387857445
6958142,comment,6957423,6957423,16,0,alan_cx,,,"This is politically motivated nonsense. At right wing government trying to prove its not homophobic. Yes the Queen issued the pardon, but it wont have been done without the government being consulted. Pardoning one person like this when thousands suffered is an insult. They should have either pardoned everyone who was convicted under these laws, or none of them. Favouring one man because of his historical significance is creating a two tier justice system.<p>And frankly, I find the whole thing problematic. Judging the past by todays standards is just wrong to my mind. He did break the law as it stood, right or wrong. Its not like we now have evidence he was innocent of the charges. What do we do, go over all the past laws that have been repealed, pardoning every one who was convicted along the way? That would be insane. What about the reverse? Surely if we are to pardon people who got convicted under laws that we have now repealed, we should go back and try any one in the past who has committed acts which are now crimes but were not then.<p>Yes, Turing is of huge historical significance. What happened to him was awful and tragic. If the notion that he wiped 2 years of WW2 is not over exaggerated, millions owe him their lives and freedoms. There for not just a great scientist, but a world figure of huge significance. But, this is not the right way to honour him. And from what I can see, is shameless political points scoring by a weak government concerned with its gay credentials.<p>If it were me, I would have left the conviction alone, let it stand as a reminders of our stupid homophobic past (1), and perhaps done something like having a national Turing Day, which could celebrate science and open humanity. Or something like that.<p>(1) Not so stupid. Problem back then was that the vast majority of people were disgusted by homosexuality. So, obviously they kept it quiet. If they got found out, they suffered. Problem for organisation concerned with secrecy, is that the social pressure placed on gay people made them easy and obvious targets for espionage. They were easily black mailed. Now a days, most people have no problem with homosexuality, so the threat of being outed is weak. The problem back then was not government, its was the social attitude in general to gay people. There for, to me it is wrong for the public to point fingers at the government. Had the public not been so prejudiced, the government could have kept their genius employed, and alive. Its our fault as a society. Government had to operate in that context. It had no choice really. And of course many people in that government would have had the same attitude as the public. But in the end, it was our fault, our shame, as a society. And that is what we should remember.",1387857343

Some people are saying this in thread outright.<p>That conclusion is more than a little premature when all we&#x27;ve got to look it is a period which started out with adoption of digital music and the informal sharing/pirate economy getting <i>way</i> out in front of vendors... and then right as they did get onboard and we started to climb past the early birds on the adoption curve, we had the biggest economic crisis since the great depression (which tends take a bite out of disposable income and entertainment spending).<p>(I think there might also be a reactionary phenomenon at work in the tech community: because the content industry freaked out and insisted copyright control and revenues were more important than anything including software/internet freedoms and civil liberties, a lot of tech people seem to decided to fight back by taking the contrary position that copyright control/revenue isn&#x27;t worth anything at all.)",1387856826

As a Stanford student personally Ive learned a lot more about best practices in software systems outside of the university; in fact you get very little of that from classes.

I think for Android you should find a phone that is hard to take the battery out or else they can turn off your phone that way.<p>2. If it&#x27;s your wallet or &#x27;stuff&#x27;, I think something like Tile would be a great tool to track your stuff. It runs on low energy bluetooth so you&#x27;ll only have to replace it once a year. And also the app has this cool radar tracking feature.<p>In such a situation there was a lot of people, there was only a second or two to know who took it and then it was gone. My girlfriends cousin had her cell phone in a fanny pack (zipped). Someone still unzipped it and took it.",1387855970

An application can use the &quot;Open Web Apps API&quot; to install itself onto the phone (with the user permission) bypassing the marketplace. So you can distribute your own apps on third party marketplaces or on your own web page.<p>There are two types of applications: Hosted and Packaged. Hosted apps are normal web pages that you host somewhere and access from the device. If you use appcache and responsive design, they will provide an experience like what native apps provide in other platforms. The packaged apps instead of being hosted are packaged and offered on the marketplace. Its basically a zipfile with your HTML/CSS/JS, when it is installed this zipfile is copied to the device and sandboxed.<p>There are three security levels. Plain, Privileged and Certified. These security levels govern what APIs your app can access. Hosted apps are always plain apps. Packaged apps can be plain apps too but they can also be privileged apps that can access an extra set of APIs or certified apps that can access every API on the device. Only Mozilla and its hardware partners can build and deploy certified apps due to security reasons (you don&#x27;t want an app with the ability to send SMS or make calls without user interaction).<p>So in summary, you can have plain web links in the launcher and you can have links to packaged apps that are actually on the device. Both things are possible and indistinguishable from a user point of view. Both solutions work offline if you use appcache with the hosted app.<p>If you want to know more, I&#x27;ve written a Free and Open eBook about it called &quot;Firefox OS Development Quick Guide&quot; available at <a href=\"http://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/</a> you can also hop by Mozilla Developer Network portal for Firefox OS at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS</a><p>=)",1387855476

Get people actually talking to each other.<p>Agreed, but at the same time, disparaging the OP for having to address rhetoric (that old saw) seems antithetical to that aim.<p>Yes, gun violence decreased in Australia when they banned guns.  Violence did not.  Violence, to me, seems to be specific enough an objective that specialization isn&#x27;t needed.

If a law were passed that banned possession of a firearm that I already owned, and/or required a mandatory buyback of that firearm, I would probably become a felon for violating that law as I would deem that law unconstitutional.  That said, if the 2nd amendment were repealed, I would cede my firearms.  That doesn&#x27;t necessarily say anything on its own, but frames the rest of what I&#x27;m about to say; which is that presumably, every responsible gun owner would also like to see a reduction in gun-related crimes, even more so than the average gun control advocates, and it boggles my mind that gun control advocates seem to focus on gun crimes specifically, to the detriment of all other forms of crime, while gun rights advocates seem to do the exact opposite.

I&#x27;ve worked with brilliant people with ivy league CS degrees who wrote much messier and less maintainable code than me, an autodidact designer/js dev with 1.5 years of experience. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, and there was something in their code that I wasn&#x27;t seeing, but I don&#x27;t think so.<p>There can also be a bit of an attitude, like the person is thinking &quot;of course this is good, I went to Stanford&quot;. But maybe that&#x27;s my imagination. Another explanation is that these people are just so good that they are able to read messy and convoluted code no problem, and us mortals need to step up our game.<p>On the other hand, these people would easily be able to reason about complex performance and security issues beyond me. I think that the hardcore CS issues are a science, while writing clean code in a web framework, browser, and API design is more of a craft.<p>If you hire too many computer scientists, your code base could be full of fascinating technical tricks, but creaky and hard to work with. Too many craftsmen, and you&#x27;ll get stuck on simple problems. It&#x27;s a balance.<p>EDIT: Downvotes? Please explain. Perhaps I am not able to fully comprehend the issues at hand.",1387854596

It&#x27;s not really about performance, it&#x27;s about simplicity. It&#x27;s trivial to set up a web server to serve static HTML pages. All I needed was Apache, SSH, and rsync. I keep all of my blog posts in ReStructuredText files which are stored in a git repository. When I want to publish, it&#x27;s as simple as `make rsync_upload` and I&#x27;m done. No database, no web interface for managing content. Just plain text and command line tools.<p>I am having one small issue with Pelican, though. When I change my theme from the default, it uses the new theme&#x27;s templates but the default theme&#x27;s stylesheet. As expected, the result is awful.

You declaim as follows:<p>> guns are a very effective tool for killing humans<p>This is quite true.<p>> and nothing else<p>This, on the other hand, is false to the point of absurdity.<p>There are many, many people, in parts of the United States where the endless cornucopia of Uncle Sam&#x27;s largesse unaccountably fails for the most part to reach, for whom a few hundred pounds&#x27; worth of venison in the freezer means the difference between a winter depending on whatever scant charity happens to be available, and a winter free of worries about where the kids&#x27; next meal will come from.<p>(I realize, of course, these people are neither fashionable nor well represented in any debate on this subject, but they are my family and the people among whom I grew to adulthood, and they mean considerably more to me than, for example, <i>you</i> do.)<p>In any case, this leaves your point, to borrow Artemus Ward&#x27;s delightful phrase, in &quot;ruther a shattered state.&quot; It hinges, after all, on the assertion that &quot;guns have only one use,&quot; which I concede would greatly simplify the matter, were it only true. Since it is not, the concession means effectively nothing.<p>I could leave the matter thus, but I can&#x27;t quite resist picking out one more howler, in order to demonstrate how little it does to improve your argument:<p>> muzzle loaded hunting muskets<p>Have you ever tried to hit what you aimed at with a muzzle-loader? Have you ever tried to shoot your supper with one? For that matter, have you ever fired any sort of firearm? Had you done, you&#x27;d likely have a better grasp of the fact that muzzle-loaders have precisely the same relevance to modern hunters as, say, a TI Explorer might have to a modern full-stack web developer -- specifically, they are far from common and mostly owned by collectors, and their competent use is a niche skill which mostly nobody bothers to attain any more, because there are much more expedient means available to produce the same result. Whether you recognize the existence of these drawbacks, which inhere in the act of discarding a century and a half of innovation in hunting technology, has no slightest effect on the reality of them -- not, of course, that they would affect anyone <i>you</i> care about, am I right?<p>And in closing, a cavil, but an amusing one: If you&#x27;re so red hot on the subject of banning guns, then why describe yourself in your HN profile as a &quot;gun for hire?&quot; Is your ultimate desire that you should put yourself out of business, sir?",1387854488

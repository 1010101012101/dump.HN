Because their business depends so heavily on how many reviews you already have (http://goo.gl/ykXu), it'll be hard to take them on.<p>So Yelp missed an opportunity somewhere during year one, but hey, it happens. They were busy and you can't do everything at once.<p>What strikes me as stranger is the businesses that have existed for several years, but still don't look across US borders. When I wanted to have some copies of my thesis printed, bound and shipped to Amsterdam, I was surprised that Lulu wasn't set up for it (they shipped from Spain, slowly and expensively) and there was no local equivalent in sight.<p>All right, all right, setting up a supply chain for mailing physical widgets in lots of confusing little European countries is hard. So let's look at a business that deals in purely virtual goods: Wufoo.  I can't find a Wufoo-like thing that'll speak Dutch to me. At all.<p>Now you may object that Wufoo takes payments, and figuring out how people in lots of confusing little European countries like to pay their bills is not easy.<p>Which brings me to the last category: web startups that provide some really cheap service or content and that fund themselves largely by ads, or by the expectation that some large company will buy them out and figure out a revenue model later (if ever).<p>What do people in The Netherlands, to come back to my small but fairly internet-savvy home country, tend to use for small-time blogging? Blogger? Wordpress? Nope. Something called web-log.nl<p>Now don't get me wrong. I respect the entrepreneurs that started web-log.nl .

1738407,comment,1737912,1738173,0,0,guns,,,"Make sure you're prepared to lose your camera and get roughed up a bit if you decide to do this (which is admirable). In my experience, cops have no patience for people who assert their rights as citizens.<p>Many police cars nowadays are fitted with front-facing video cameras. One sage piece of advice from a friend of mine is to:<p><pre><code>    * be extremely polite and cordial; ""How may I help you officer?""
    * respond requests to be searched with, ""Sir, I don't consent to 
      any searches""
    * When you step out of a vehicle, assume the position: legs 
      apart, hands behind your head.
    * Politely ask, ""Am I free to go officer, or am I under arrest?""
      (repeatedly if necessary)
</code></pre>
The point of this is to ensure that nothing you do can be possibly interpreted as an act of aggression by the officer, while asserting your rights. The police camera will show you in a pose of total submission, and any aggression on the part of the police officer will be unjustifiable.<p>The cop will be annoyed, but he won't touch you, and if he does, you will be vindicated. Your camera footage, OTOH, isn't guaranteed to survive a run-in with the cops (this happened to a friend of mine), and any natural reaction you might have to your camera getting snatched from your hands can be used as an excuse to whip out the tazer.<p>Remember HNers, the job of contemporary police is to arrest you, not to ""serve and protect"".<p>This American Life had a great show on this recently:<p><a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/right-to-remain-silent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/r...</a>",1285737920

You'll use writing skills to communicate your ideas to your peers and management, and to document your code coherently.<p>An English degree will do more to teach you about communication than a Comp. Sci. degree. Unless you go on to graduate-level work, in which case you'll probably learn the art of writing completely incomprehensible literary criticism.

Once you make it all about the money, then it's only about the money.  As such other niceties tend to fall by the wayside as you end up with, well, Johns and providers.

I've had mine fail (mag stripe wear, etc.) maybe 3 times in 20 years, but even then it's still usable the old-fashioned way. My iPhone fails (low battery, weak signal) at least weekly.

A business would be more willing to do so if they're sure the cost is reaching new customers. Perhaps that's an important part of the Groupon secret sauce -- the purchase of the 'coupon' with credit cards that provide a relatively strong identity signal. That could be used -- eventually, at least -- to target future promotions to unique new customers.<p>Does anyone know what sort of data the business gets from Groupon? Have any businesses offered repeat Groupons that <i>aren't</i> available to people who bought the first one?",1285736687

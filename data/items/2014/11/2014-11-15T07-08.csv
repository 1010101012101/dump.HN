It was just two days after I landed so I was pretty nervous.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve gone to 5 meetups. One thing that I&#x27;ve learned is Business Cards are vital. So much so that I&#x27;ve decided to bite the bullet and print up some of my own even though I&#x27;m still job hunting.<p>He didn&#x27;t mention it but from what I can tell the Taxis here are a world apart. Stuff like the doors automatically close for you and the drivers all wear suits. Sorry I&#x27;ve only been taking trains everywhere.<p>The trains themselves are also a major plus point for Tokyo. My house is along the Mita-line and almost everywhere I go is is just a single connection away. The busy hours are not that bad too since my head is above the crowd.<p>I still get a thrill everytime a 10 car train rushes past the platform.<p>Also half of everyone wears suits. Even people in otherwise &quot;low-class&quot; service jobs wear suits.<p>Anyway: if you are in tokyo you should 100% visit the next HN meetup on the 21st. If you&#x27;re new feel free to email me and we can meetup and walk together from the station. First time I came here I arrived an hour ahead of time to find the place. That turned out to be a bit early and it got cold waiting outside.",1416038293

Kvark, one of our key contributors recently did a talk at the Toronto meetup[0] (starts from ~53:00) discussing some of the design of the API.<p>Bear in mind that the API still could use more work, and could be documented better, but it is already pretty promising. We currently only support OpenGL as a back-end, but hope to support more APIs in the future. This support is currently blocked on a some language features being fully implemented.<p>The biggest project built using gfx-rs to date is hematite[1] - a re-implementation of Minecraft. Colin Sherratt is also doing some neat work with it in his engine, snowmew[2], which is more graphics intensive.<p>If you are interested in having a chat with us, feel free to hop on our gitter room[1] or #rust-gamedev (irc.mozilla.org).<p>- [0]: <a href=""https://air.mozilla.org/toronto-rust-meetup-october-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://air.mozilla.org/toronto-rust-meetup-october-2014/</a><p>- [1]: <a href=""https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite</a><p>- [2]: <a href=""https://github.com/csherratt/snowmew/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/csherratt/snowmew/</a><p>- [3]: <a href=""https://gitter.im/gfx-rs/gfx-rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitter.im/gfx-rs/gfx-rs</a>",1416038276

Code is a liability, and testing code is no exception.<p>Writing tests in static languages is still required. You just have to write a smaller amount of them. What&#x27;s more, type checking is enforced in a more systematic way. With tests, you have to rely on people to write them. If a type system is well designed, people will use it to model their code, and the type checking is done automatically.<p>What&#x27;s more, types should not be reduced to the type checking phase. Types are a way to provide a high level model/structure. You still need this if you are working in a  medium/large project. With static types, this model have nicer semantics, and is more useful.",1416038174

And despite whatever professed outward collective-mentality present in IT, I know that many of my friends and co-workers suffer from existential doubts, personal isolation and obsessive-compulsive behaviors in private, if not more so. If anything, the fact that the author chooses to share his personal history so openly makes me more comfortable about his handling of personal issues than others who lead double of lives and &quot;#winning on facebook&quot; and &quot;suffering alone.&quot;<p>As another perspective on depression and anxiety counter to the HN&#x27;s mainstream answer, I highly recommend &quot;Happiness and Its Discontent&quot; essay here (<a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/HappinessIts-Discontents/144019/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/HappinessIts-Discontents/144019...</a>)<p>&quot;But we are mistaken when we interpret anxiety and other forms of existential disorientation as being at odds with a well-lived life.

8611140,comment,8610129,8611054,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"(Sorry for continuing the rather long discussion, but I&#x27;d like to achieve some resolution here.)<p>By &quot;real&quot;, I mean that the concept of a density matrix is derived completely on top of the postulates of quantum mechanics in combination with the Born rule.  There&#x27;s nothing fundamental about mixed states; you can also have classical mixed states (e.g. deriving thermodynamics from classical statistical mechanics).  It&#x27;s essentially just taking the postulates for pure states and applying a layer of statistics on top of it.  I believe it was von Neumann that originally did this?  In other words, the density matrix formulation does not add any additional predictive capability to physics that the original QM from the 1920s did not already provide.  It&#x27;s just a more convenient tool for connecting QM to experimentally realizable systems.  Do you disagree with this?<p>When you lose entanglement due to decoherence (specifically, the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix approaching zero), these correlations are lost because you&#x27;re essentially performing a measurement.  But they still exist in the whole Alice + Bob + you and your measurement device system!  But then, this starts treading into the discussion of the whole unsolved measurement problem which I kind of wanted to lurk around, since no one ever gets anywhere with those discussions.<p>Indeed your last point (&quot;To say that we should do better and bring the environment back into the picture is missing the point&quot;) is essentially the whole picture I&#x27;m focusing on.  Perhaps my background with quantum chemistry has slanted the way I explain things on here, because you&#x27;re never collapsing these systems when you perform simulations of them to calculate their properties.",1416037435

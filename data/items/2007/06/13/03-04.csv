There are some key differences between the ""people search"" approach and mine, though.<p>1. The people search approach is O(n) amount of work for the person searching. Mine is O(1).<p>2. The people search gives immediate results. Mine occur sporadically. For some purposes (e.g. planning a reunion), mine is clearly inferior in this regard, but I kind of like it. Delayed rewards can be very refreshing.",1181707008

I recently moved to the SF Bay Area and found that my cell on a nationwide plan was roaming continuously.  Somehow the phone I bought from them won't update its network listing so the options given to me from their reps were 1. Renew my 2 year plan and get $100 towards a new phone or 2. Buy a phone off of craigslist and pay them $20 to transfer it.  I'll be glad to switch to a GSM network where I can buy phones online and swap the SIM cards if I need to.",1181706218

As you exponentiate the sparse matrix more and more you get a less and less sparse matrix.  I was really hurting for memory.<p>Yeah, I really wish I could have spent more time exploring the algorithms side.  If I didn't start Xobni during summer 2006 the plan was to write a book on machine learning, in practice.  One of these days..<p>P.S. Would love to get in touch.  Can you post your email or send me a note?  My email is adam dot smith foo xobni.com where foo == @.",1181704778

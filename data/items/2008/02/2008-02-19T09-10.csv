First, calm down and remember to breath: its gonna be okay.<p>Next, you need to figure out why the company you are working at has allowed you to hang around for six months without helping you get integrated, or--if you really are too inexperienced (not 'dumb') for the startup, then why hasn't anyone fired you yet?<p>If you've been stuck for two months, and are in a resource constrained environment (which most startups are), then you  need to figure out who is steering this ship, and why they are willing to let you stowaway on it.<p>Maybe you are being more effective than you realize, which would be great, but I think its more likely that no one has a firm grasp on what is happening, and that isn't a reassuring sign. It sounds like the people around you aren't communicating with each other, and its hard to believe that will lead to a successful product being put together.<p>It doesn't sound like you have a strong personal relationship with the other people there, because otherwise you probably would have just asked someone. My advice would be to first dig up your resume and update it to the extent possible, then see if you can establish a friendly relationship with anyone there who would write you a recommendation (or more likely take a phonecall on your behalf), and then ask the questions you asked here to whoever is in charge at your startup.<p>In the long-run it isn't worth being miserable and frustrated just to keep collecting a paycheck. Finding someone to talk about your concerns is better in every way. First, you look like you care about the quality of the job you are doing (which it seems like you do, otherwise you wouldn't be upset about it). Next, it will force the organization to figure out why its communicating poorly, or otherwise make it very clear to you that its a sinking ship.<p>Also, I think its a bad sign that people are snidely disrespecting their coworkers work. That kind of thing can fly in a larger company, but petty rivalry and negativity will kill a small group of people.<p>Best of luck!",1203413536

118803,comment,118799,118799,0,0,bdfh42,,,"The deadliest tangles wrapped around a companies Enterprise Systems often result from the structure of the organisation. Individual departments and operational functions depend upon small efficiencies generated by the existing systems. A replacement system might represent a dramatic improvement in overall efficiency but would almost certainly disrupt the existing organisation. Project like that can only be led from the top of an organisation - without that level of leadership the IT function is confined to continuing the development of those small efficiencies to the detriment of the whole.<p>You see it everywhere I am afraid.",1203413279

I'm a recent grad<p>It's been six months and i still fell like I don't know anything. The project I've been working on for the last 2 months has been just dragging along. i think the problem is that i don't totally understand the esoteric codebase we have (back end software stuff). everytime i ask a question people react like i'm bothering them with my personal problems. I realize that it's a startup but it's hard to glean what i need from the current code (that some others have confided is not that great). am i too dumb for a startup? am i going to get fired?",1203412006

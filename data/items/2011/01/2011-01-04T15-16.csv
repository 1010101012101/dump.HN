2067257,comment,2065871,2066500,0,0,phaedrus,,,"I disagree. Turing's original paper where he introduced the Turing machine addressed the question of whether a discrete machine is interchangeable with an analog mind; Turing's argument is that even if the states are continuously variable there comes a point where two states are too close to be distinguished by the mind itself, and therefore it is permissible to say that the number of states IS finite and can be modeled by a discrete state Turing machine. Now put Shannon's information theory in the mix: a channel, even a sloppy one, has a bit rate and an error rate. My intuition is that whatever speed increase you get from allowing sloppy cirfuits will be matched by an increased error rate. If you trade off error rate of a sloppy channel against using fewer bits of precision in a discrete/non error prone channel, you should get the same effective information rate.<p>All of these claims of increasing performance by sacrificing precision are achieving it by ignoring the tradeoff between rate and precision. It would be the same as if I claimed to speed up a lossless compression algorithm by discarding every other byte while measuring data rate as if I were not losing information.<p>My point is any tradeoff you can make by losing information in hardware, you can make the same information tradeoff in software.",1294155219

Even if the effect it claims is true, it wouldn't result in an ""everyone's stupid"" society, it would result in a split society with an even more distinct intellectual upper and lower class. Not desirable, to be sure, but not necessarily dangerous to the human race as a whole.<p>2. What we arrogantly see as the ""stupidity"" of the lower classes is almost entirely caused by social and environmental factors. Genetically, they're not necessarily inferior at all. Even if genetic drift COULD occur within just a few generations, which I doubt, genetic effects would be entirely dominated by   environmental factors such as education, nutrition, and socialization.<p>If you pulled a healthy baby from the worst white trash family at birth, raised it well and gave it an education, there's no reason to think it would be any less intelligent than you.",1294154786

Double isn't supposed to be any less safe than any other type.<p>> <i>I wasn't referring to this being the cause, just in other languages if you pass a string through JSON it would never end up being decoded to a double, just because syntactically it is a double.</i><p>I believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding here. Other languages would indeed convert to double if so instructed, or if the value presented was a (high) floating point value. And once again, I can see no inherent problem with a JSON parser that looks at a floating point number and interprets it as a double. The only problem would be the memory space of a double vs that of a float or smaller type, but since PHP doesn't make that distinction the point is moot. I don't see the evilness of it, nor do I see how static typing would avoid bugs such as this.<p>More generally speaking, if one of the basic types of a language is defectively handled, there is no way this bug goes away if you declare that type beforehand. It has quite simply nothing to do with it. I guess an argument could be made that less code would be vulnerable on account of having less instances of doubles around, but it would still be a huge problem. And it's not like floating point numbers are somehow rarely used.",1294153339

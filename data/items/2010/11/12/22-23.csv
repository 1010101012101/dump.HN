1899631,comment,1899437,1899437,0,0,hfinney,,,"Let's step back for a moment and think about what our goal should be in medicine. Suppose we could extend everyone's healthy life by 10 years. How much have we gained? Say there are 7 billion people. Have we added 70 billion man-years of healthy life? Not necessarily. After all, every year people experience 7 billion man-years of life. After 10 years, we'll have added 70 billion. So this great medical advance is the same as waiting 10 years! All we are really doing is speeding up the rate of accumulation of man-years. And even that is only temporary. After 10 years people will again be dying at the rate they are today (just 10 years older).<p>You could get the same speed-up of accumulating man-years by increasing the birth rate - more happy humans racking up experiences. But wait, the birth rate is falling! Is that a moral catastrophe? Yes, if you want to maximize the rate of accumulation of healthy man-years.<p>So these issues are complicated. It's too easy to focus on this personally. Sure, I want to live forever, and I'm taking steps to do so. But for the population as a whole, the calculus works out rather differently.",1289602545

Honestly, the easiest way to develop a potentially-good bot would be to give it every piece of input and try to evolve a good player, as opposed to trying to develop all the logic manually. Such a bot is guaranteed to have some artifacts which cause it to respond to certain situations and generally play sub-optimally, basically making it look like a human player, anyways.",1289602518

1899605,comment,1897947,1898322,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I agree with your comment, but this is a big impediment for a lot of developers. I think it's partly conceptual. SOAP libraries will grab a wsdl file and generate a class with methods for each procedure the service exposes. That makes a lot of developers think something has been made easy for them, but they still have to understand the class interface to know how to talk to the service. REST is the same; you have to understand the interface (resource representations) to know how to talk to the service. REST just skips that middle code generation part where you tightly couple your code to a particular version of the service api. The developers who are looking for a library just want the code generation.<p>I tell people that they've already got the communication stack in place and don't need code generation; what they need is to understand the api and design the classes on their side that will _use_ the api. The http and json stuff gets buried there, not in a client-side facade class.",1289601966

One can build a REST system that uses meaningful transactions around it's operations - the obvious solution is to make the operations that are exposed the same as what you want to wrap transactions about, and only expose these operations. In fact I find it strange that some might think these <i>are</i> two exclusive concepts.<p>The other problem you describe sounds like it would be easily solved with client-side caching. REST and caching remote operations are not exclusive of one another either. HTTP provides a very natural way to control caching. Having to make 100 network round trips for the same resource should be unnecessary in any system, REST or not.",1289600882

My product has a 4% chance of going viral. If I lose the contract lottery, it's because I've won the product lottery, and that 4% means I've got a rapidly-growing product that is going to make me a lot of money. The risk of that extra $1000 is well worth knowing that I'm not going to have to move my product between hosting providers when the blogosphere in in a mad frenzy about my internet tortilla delivery service.<p>That's completely different than a scenario wherein the hosting provider says ""This is a variable contract; you owe us $2.50 for 50 GB of bandwidth, but each month we pick one of our 25 customers and they pay $1,000."" There's no way in hell I'd sign on for that. There is no indicator of success correlated to the risk there.<p>Without context, I'm not sure that these questions are all that useful.

If not, go to step 2, repeat.<p>Step 2 can be subjective, especially if there are several likely causes. This can lead to different doctors giving different diagnosis. The more times a doctor has seen the same problem, the more likely he/she will be correct the first time. Specialists come in handy here, gathering lots of experience regarding only specific conditions.<p>For rare diseases, hard to diagnose, or those which aren't fully understood, repeating steps #2 - #4 is going to be more likely.

For example, you have to make sure that you use the right flags on gcc to debug your code with debugging symbols (not the default) or use ""tail call optimization"".  No, actually it is worse: serious C projects have large, ugly Makefiles with optimization parameters, dependent library libs specified, dependent library include paths, etc etc.  It is so ugly that several systems have been written for the singular purpose of creating a Makefile just so that your little Gtk App can compile.

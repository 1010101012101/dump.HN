31518,comment,31499,31499,0,0,Harj,,,"well if you can opt out of having applications appear in your news feed then developers lose out on both friend invites and news feed growth - both of which apps such as ilike/slide had access to.  <p>i think that's the point of the article - you can still use fb as a viral platform, it's just as viral for new apps as it is for the more established start ups.",1183081793

Right now, it only includes a question, which is a link to the application. <p>-News feed: the feed announcement that reads ""Shawn asks Hey! Help me out? 3:33pm"" should really include the question I asked. <p>-As a user, I don't really know what questions I might ask that would be better asked here than over email.  Some example questions (displayed when I'm at the ""ask a question"" form) that show why your app is better than email would really help. <p>Good luck!<p><i>edit: formatting",1183081373

31512,comment,30659,30758,0,0,acmegeek,,,"Well, yes, the ""meta"" part is just how the actual key is broken down. What may be different is that decryption involves more than just figuring out the values for the key, but also its breakdown. <p>For example, if the bit length breakdown of each key chunk was 17, 15, 23, 12, 20, 19, 22 you would have a 128 bit key. But its not as ""simple"" as determining the 128 bits. There are 7 key chunks, and the length of each key chunk and the order of their bit length is essential to decryption.<p>The same key might be guessed with 6 chunks of different bit lengths. This won't decrypt it and in fact it won't even come close or give any indication that it was the correct key sequence. <p>So, this is what I mean by a ""meta"" key. There is an additional ""dimension"" to the key, this dimension means that there are an additional few magnitudes in the keyspace than simply the bit length.<p>So, in a simpler scenario, a 32 bit key, which normally would be pretty easy to crack, is much harder if you also have to determine if it breaks down: 5-13-9-5 or 17-15 or 9-32 or 5-7-3-6-11 or... The number of permutations are staggering.<p>Is there another cryptosystem that uses something similar?<p>",1183080158

However, I can say that there is no catch -- it's just as great an incentive as it looks.  In fact, one company I spoke with is working on solar power development, and due to other, stacking credits, their investors are guaranteed a significant profit even on a complete loss of capital.  Fascinating and scary.",1183080033

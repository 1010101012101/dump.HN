However, you&#x27;ve always been limited on desktop and notebooks in high security assessment given all the functionality (esp wireless) in them. There&#x27;s just way too much risk. So, I recommended hardened thin-clients/monitor/keyboard/mouse plus key servers in a shielded room, no wireless anything, shielding of building from external signals where possible, and of course a lot of distance around the building.

10065914,comment,10060681,10064570,0,0,dekhn,,,"Fair criticism.  I didn&#x27;t say that they discovered an entirely new biosynthetic pathway.  I said they identified and cloned genes (I think your confusion stems from a false interpretation of what I said; I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that the team identified every single gene).  Those are two different things; note for example the link you pointed me at is effectively an abstract pathway.<p>So, since you&#x27;re making a technical nitpick with a short detail of my comment, I&#x27;ll apply the full flame of my technical capabilities.  We&#x27;ll start with the paper itself:<p>The abstract says &quot; We combined enzyme discovery, enzyme engineering, and pathway and strain optimization to realize full opiate biosynthesis in yeast.  The resulting opioid biosynthesis strains required expression of 21\n(thebaine) and 23 (hydrocodone) enzyme activities from plants, mammals, bacteria, and yeast itself&quot;<p>So the authors say that they discovered enzymes.  This is consistent with my statement.  Your statement is irrelevant; discovering a biosynthetic pathway is a <i>distinct</i> thing from discovering the enzymes that carry it out (but, I will agree that in many cases, when you discover a biosynthetic pathway you can identify the enzymes and genes that code for them at the same time.  It&#x27;s not necessary, though).  What the authors did here is <i>engineer a biosynthetic pathway</i>.<p>Next statment that supports my position from the paper:\n&quot;Also, key enzyme(s) that epimerize the (S)-benzylisoquinoline scaffold to the (R)-enantiomer, which is the biosynthetic precursor of the promorphinan and morphinan scaffolds, have remained unknown even after decades of study until recently identified by two groups (19, 20) and by our team as described below.&quot;<p>Note the above extract from the paper, if correct, <i>completely abolishes</i> your point.  The authors cite their own recent work, as well as the work of others, which was required for engineering biosynthetic pathway.<p>Here is a link to the author&#x27;s prior work identifying a required step in the process:\n<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6245/309"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6245/309</a><p>At this point I rest my case.  My original statement stands, as it does, and your criticism appears to be only a pointless and ultimately <i>irrelevant</i> nitpick of my statement.<p>Further, I would appreciate not using the term &quot;burst your bubble&quot;.  It&#x27;s immature, and when said to a person who&#x27;s been studying synthetic biology for more than 2 decades, who can read the primary literature, and compose a coherent reply, makes you look petty.",1439657721

10065887,comment,10064657,10065034,0,0,hollerith,,,"I think it is important to keep in mind that (for example) a Mac user that never uses Terminal.app or another terminal-emulation app probably has no reliance on the TTY abstraction. The abstraction is present in his operating system, but if it were absent or broken, the the user would probably not notice anything different.<p>I had to add the word &quot;probably&quot; to the above statement because I have not actually tried disabling the TTY subsystem in OS X and verifying that all the apps typically used by non-programmers continue to work normally.<p>Moreover, when our typical Mac user visits a web site, probably nothing goes wrong if the TTY subsystem on the web server is absent or disabled. (Of course, the administrators of the server will not be able to ssh into the server, but these days, a significant fraction of web servers are adminned using methods that do not rely on anyone&#x27;s being able to ssh into the servers.)<p>I kind of agree with parent, though: during my more obsessive moments I do get worried / depressed that a large fraction of <i>programmers</i> are still reliant on software reliant on the TTY abstraction.

10065883,comment,10061938,10061938,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Ben Gurion is on a win streak in emanation attacks. Neat example with a common culprit: writings on TEMPEST said cellphones within meters of a STU-III telephone compromised it immediately with inadvertant, active attack. This is going in opposite direction with a known attack vector. A nice example of a &quot;known unknown.&quot;  That wireless devices, cellphones or SOC&#x27;s, greatly increase risk in EMSEC is even more evident with this. Gotta stay banned in high-security organizations and that presents very tough tradeoffs along with supply chain issues in terms of SOC&#x27;s. Identifying the hidden functions of SOC&#x27;s (including analog/RF) is a cat-and-mouse game that rivals the brains that go into software attack and defense from what examples insiders gave me.<p>Far as EMSEC, I&#x27;ve pushed people in INFOSEC to consider it for a decade. I argued we should because (a) U.S. used such attacks since 1914 w/ Russia using them wisely in Cold War, (b) there&#x27;s a sizeable industry on defense (TEMPEST) side, (c) most commercial/personal systems were massively vulnerable, and (d) research in possibly hostile countries continued. Supported even more by leaked NSA TAO catalog that features emanation attacks, including one (RAGEMASTER) that looks like my past work. All outside high-security said it was theoretical (despite use by Russia), no evidence/detection of any attacks (how would they lol?), or so rare as to be not important (again, measured how?). Took a while for it to really hit mainstream attention and I&#x27;m glad to see people in recent years are finally worrying about a 101-year old attack strategy (emanations).<p>Ben Gurion&#x27;s results, past and present, support my case: a new cat-and-mouse game could form on pro side for stealing classified or trade secret information with emanation attacks. Declassified documents on TEMPEST history showed defenders had a <i>hard</i> time for first decade even for passive attacks. The likes of NSA, Russia, Israel, and <i>maybe</i> China are decades ahead of defenders with Israeli researchers innovating the most on attacks. NSA valued it so much, even against allies, that it once diluted its capabilities when sharing with UK and (IIRC) Canada to keep them behind (read: vulnerable).<p>My recommendation is that research-funding organizations in as many countries as possible start dropping money on their best E.E.&#x27;s to recreate those decades of research. Reducing the signal, shielding, masking... all of it for each component that&#x27;s common in systems. Another easy route, which I used to recommend, was EMSEC safes or rooms with filters on cabling plus the myriad other leaks that crop up (even toilets lol). Seemed to be easier, but not easy, as there were more companies doing it than securing arbitrary equipment operating in the open. We do a ton of research until even our undergrads and amateurs can apply given techniques to solve the problems for boxes, safes, or rooms they own. Maybe. It&#x27;s quite complicated...<p>Regardless, these attacks will only get better and for more parties. NSA et al long figured out it was best attack albeit required specialists and sometimes physical presence. Demanded they save it for high priority targets. Attacks with cellphones and interdiction, along with radios in COTS stuff, mean physical presence might not be an issue in future attacks. The game&#x27;s heating up and defenders got a lot of catch-up to do. I suggest they start by studying the field of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) [1], books on TEMPEST shielding [2], commercial sector [3], and declassified military documents on similar subjects (some in [4], esp Red-Black).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Design-Shielded-Enclosures-Cost-Effective-Methods/dp/0750672706"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Design-Shielded-Enclosures-Cost-Effect...</a>\n(An example.

All the same brand and all the same size. At least 2 of the pairs absolutely do not fit, while the others are extremely comfortable. When I bought all of them they fit perfectly, but over time with wear and washing the fit on some has just gone out of whack compared to the others.<p>2. This would be a difficult business to scale though. If all of your customers are sending garments in to be measured and then you are sending them back out along with other garments that are curated, it could be a labor intensive business.<p>Overall though I like the idea. I hate shopping, I hate having to go to a store and try things on. Then usually I get home and half the stuff I bought I never wear because, as @rbcoffee pointed out, there is some quirk that annoys me.<p>A feature you may consider adding would be that clothes a customer doesn&#x27;t like could be sent in, you either buy them back or offer them a credit towards new clothes sent back out to them in the same style, but a different size.<p>This idea kind of reminds me of <a href=""http://www.belloverde.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belloverde.com/</a> or Astor Black which are online custom tailors.",1439657212

Meaning to get back to the bomb-producing levels they are at <i>today</i> would take years. If they broke the agreement next year, they&#x27;d simply have had years of setback.<p>Apparently there are also mechanisms in place to immediately have sanctions return on Iran if it were found to be working on a bomb. After all, they&#x27;re a signatory member of the non-proliferation treaty, and the entire world is in support of non-proliferation. If they were found to be working on a bomb, they&#x27;d have a much, much weaker moral position than they do today (and it&#x27;s already pretty abysmal), so the notion that sanctions would return isn&#x27;t surprising. The notion that all nuclear facilities would be taken away if the agreement was violated, also isn&#x27;t unrealistic, and that it&#x27;d be at the threat of military action, rather than just diplomatic action.<p>Lastly, as far as continuously referenced experts are concerned, it seems you&#x27;re overstating the ability to simply violate the agreement in secret. Apparently that&#x27;s pretty damn hard to do on a normal day, but even harder to do with the level of access and transparency, and while we can mock the US at times in its competence, I have very few doubts about its intelligence capacities.<p>The rest of your post is spot on though. (sanctions would erode over time, military option doesn&#x27;t exist, and Iran has a growing economy and population that will strengthen its influence in the region).<p>A quick overview. Vox is pretty biased and not very technical, but it&#x27;s still a decent overview on what experts think, how many centrifuges are taken away (70%, leaving only knockoffs of 1970s centrifuges), how much fissile material is taken away (97%), what the limits of enrichment (allowed to enrich to <4%, 20% is necessary for medicine, 90% for a bomb) are, what other requirements will be met (one of its reactor&#x27;s cores must be replaced with one unable to produce weapon&#x27;s grade material, spent fuel must be shipped out, inspections and transparency is full) etc:<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/2/8337347/iran-deal-good"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/4/2/8337347/iran-deal-good</a>",1439654969

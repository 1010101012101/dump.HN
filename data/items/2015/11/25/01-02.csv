If you want double density, all of the floppies to be written on\n    must be pre-initialized before the backup starts.

With time, they break down, succumb to exceptions, or lead to blind alleys. Consider &quot;privacy&quot;, which is very new from a legal point of view, but no longer has quite the same new-rule smell. Compare &quot;consideration&quot; (for contracts), which has functioned a good long while, but isn&#x27;t applied universally, and might be breaking down.<p>It&#x27;s a kind of technology. Best case, our advances keep pace with our needs.<p>But the _pursuit_ of universality, as a principle for rulemaking, has lasted a good long while. The further we get from the incisive &quot;moment of truth&quot; for a rule, the less &quot;just&quot; it feels in application. The more the exceptions and uncertainties, the more we suspect corruption and discrimination. In other words: The more a rule shows its age, the more those who do not (and, practically, cannot) understand its subtleties perceive it as arbitrary.<p>It&#x27;s a somewhat indulgent, idealistic line of thought.

These codes share a property such that the wider the word, the fewer the additional bits required. So, e.g.<p><pre><code>    8 bits + 5 bits\n   16 bits + 6 bits\n   32 bits + 7 bits\n   64 bits + 8 bits\n</code></pre>\nThat is enough for a minimum &quot;hamming distance&quot; of 4 between valid words. That gets you SEC (single error correction) plus DED (double error detection). You can save 1 bit if you&#x27;re willing to forego the latter.<p>Many decades ago (but I couldn&#x27;t find a reference with a quick google) Micron made a chip that had on-board ECC. IIRC it was 8+4, which meant that it would internally correct a 1 bit error, but there was a possibility it would mis-correct some 2+ bit errors (which were rare).<p>But that meant that Micron was putting 50% more bits onto a die over a non-ECC device. They probably did this not for system reliability but to cover up the failings of their chips at the time. Yes you could make each bit smaller, but no way would it pay off if you needed to put 50% more bits onto a die.<p>ECC is best done with wide words. For example, a SIMM that presents a 72-bit interface can easily be built with 9 chips, each 8-bits wide.<p>The system (CPU, memory controller, whatever) takes in 72 bits (or some multiple thereof) from DRAM and does ECC internally. Note that as words get wider the time to compute ECC goes up. So a system could even speculatively execute using the uncorrected data, while in parallel checking to make sure that it was OK. This requires recovery in case of error, but since errors are infrequent it could be a big win overall.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense for a DDRx spec to require ECC. It&#x27;s cheaper and smarter to do ECC at a system level.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code</a>",1448414969

Few of the facts the system is meant to deal with reduce to anything so discreet as bitstrings. Legal rules in statutes and even in case law, like the bit of First Amendment in the article, start out trying to state rules with all the rigor of a pure function.

When Mayer launched the effort last fall, everyone agreed the existing structure had outlived its usefulness—for instance, mobile products was partitioned from other groups. But Mayer embarked on the process without laying out a grand vision for it. Instead, she began sketching out different scenarios in one-on-one meetings with various executives, floating one plan by one exec and a different by another. Unable to make up her mind, the process dragged on for months. “She went through 20 different permutations,” says an executive with knowledge of the process. “The product guys were twisting in the wind, not knowing what they were going to run.”<p>> Product releases slowed to a trickle, and a turf war brewed as executives became concerned with their futures. Jon McCormack, a star executive who had joined Yahoo in January from Amazon and was promised a broad engineering portfolio covering critical areas like mobile, landed in the vacuum created by Mayer’s indecision. He was gone by the end of February and now works for Google. When Mayer announced the new structure in April, it was too late. “That was the beginning of everyone losing faith,” says another senior executive. “That’s when people started to look for other jobs.”<p>I don&#x27;t consider being the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company that&#x27;s still trying to figure out where it fits in the 21st century a job anyone could possibly do, but it seems like Mayer&#x27;s strategy has been a little all over the place with no real gain in any segment. From the WSJ article:<p>> As her strategy has shifted, Ms. Mayer has variously cast Yahoo as a challenger to Netflix Inc. in online video content and as a threat to Google Inc. in Web search, but has made little progress toward either goal.<p>I&#x27;m just not sure where she&#x27;s trying to push Yahoo towards.

I have a cabin somewhat in the middle of nowhere, with a convenient LTE tower across the lake. During the summer, its my favourite place to work. Get up early with the sun, make some real breakfast (bacon and eggs, usually), and go throw a ball for the dogs until they&#x27;re ready for morning nap. The work day usually starts around 8 or 9, although there&#x27;s the occasional 7am conference call. Work until I get hungry, make some lunch, go for a wander with the dogs for a bit. Maybe have a bit of a nap. Make supper whenever seems appropriate, sit on the beach and watch the sun go down, maybe work some more, or hang out with my partner (when she can come), and then have a fantastic sleep away from all the city noise.<p>It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s lazy, just more relaxed.

The golden rule, Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative, the non-aggression principle are all attempts at this, and each one has accumulated an extensive list of exceptions and footnotes. The golden rule breaks down with masochists, the categorical imperative breaks down with increasing specificity of the action in question and the NAP flat out ignores externalities.<p>The world is too complex for simple rules, honourable though their intentions may be, and older attempts at this are guiltier than modern ones. The steadfastness to which America cleaves to an 18th century charter has posed significant roadblocks to establishing effective policy in the 21st century. While very readable, the Constitution is frustratingly unspecific. An enormous effort is spent in &quot;interpreting&quot; it in a way that can support policy, in the same way that the Bible or Koran is bent to suit the individual ideologies of their adherents.<p>With the right to bear arms, all that can really be agreed upon is that &quot;arms&quot; is something more than a butter knife and something less than nuclear ordinance. Free speech shall be guaranteed, except when it comes to advertising speech, fighting words, death threats and the list goes on. In these debates, the opinions of the framers should be only slightly more relevant than those of Plato, Hume or Rousseau, and what should dominate the debate is the actual consequences of the policy in question. \nWhat&#x27;s more, the absence of certain rights in the constitution has hindered recognition of the right to shelter, or safety, for example.<p>When Ruth Ginsberg was asked to recommend new founding policy for a revolutionary Egypt she said this:<p>&quot;I would not look to the U.S. Constitution, if I were drafting a Constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the Constitution of South Africa. That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights, had an independent judiciary. … It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done.

If the person buys X amounts of lies then you get Y amount of points.<p>What does lying have to do with interviews? \nNothing at all, but to make a person believe you, you must utilize and have a full comprehension of the social dynamic that occurs in a interview.(IMO)<p>Like I said, I am just putting this out there. However one thing is certain you need humans for this, it can not be a program. Also lying and wondering if that person believes you  would add the stress of uncertainty that inherently comes with interviews.

I know old school but I think this is the route to go. If you can find a HR professional who does IT headhunting. Her wisdom is priceless.

10624722,comment,10606226,10609159,0,0,pluma,,,"I used to describe myself as a web standards evangelist ten years ago and my first instinct when I saw React (both because of JSX and because it was from Facebook) was to laugh and shake my head (until I decided to &quot;give it five minutes&quot; and found out I was wrong) so I hope my perspective could make some sense to you.<p>--<p>Just to clarify: React is not about killing the separation of concerns. React is about one thing: converting application state to a component tree and rendering that component tree to the DOM via highly optimised diffing.<p>At the base level, React turns state into component trees. Similarly, Redux is only about managing state and changes to that state. These are fairly straightforward ideas but having them as clearly defined building blocks with an extremely straightforward API (Redux moreso than React but in the trivial case a React component as of 0.14 can be a plain old pure function) radically simplifies application development.<p>I&#x27;ll say it again: application development. I haven&#x27;t said anything about HTML and CSS yet. This is as relevant to the web as it is to native application development and it&#x27;s not an accident that React has been decoupled from ReactDOM with the latter now being merely the implementation detail of going the last mile and rendering things to the DOM (or to HTML strings) and maintaining DOM bindings and diffs.<p>--<p>A quick interlude: JSX is not HTML. It looks like XML and in many examples it has HTML tag names in it, but it&#x27;s not HTML -- nor is it XML for that matter. It&#x27;s just (entirely optional but very useful once you get over the initial visceral discomfort) syntactic sugar for defining component trees (not DOM subtrees). The syntax is obviously based on XML but it is a lot simpler and the familiarity obviously helps.<p>--<p>One thing most people don&#x27;t understand about React (not least because React isn&#x27;t vocal enough about it -- just like Flux wasn&#x27;t vocal enough about certain concepts until Redux came along and showcased why they&#x27;re important and useful) is that you can and should distinguish between presentational components and application logic.<p>If you use Redux (or Flux -- but with Flux there&#x27;s the problem that most things called Flux aren&#x27;t actually Flux because nobody really understood it) most of your components will be entirely presentational and the logic will live outside the components except for a few so-called &quot;containers&quot; which are just extremely thin wrappers.<p>So with React+Redux you then have your component structure living in React components and your logic living in a few functions that describe transitions of the immutable application state plus a few &quot;containers&quot; that just describe how the state is applied to the API of the few &quot;smart&quot; components that actually need interaction.<p>Sure, HTML strings intuitively <i>feel</i> more appropriate for describing these components and Web Components definitely look more &quot;HTML-like&quot; in that regard, but at the end of the day you&#x27;re still writing something XML-like with made up elements (whether they&#x27;re Web Components or React &quot;components&quot;) that needs to be processed by JavaScript before being turned into the actual DOM.<p>--<p>One major change React brings to the table that isn&#x27;t spoken nearly as much of as it should be is that React can be used to render applications to HTML, without the DOM, on the server. This usually gets mentioned in the context of &quot;load times&quot; or &quot;SEO friendliness&quot; but it&#x27;s a pretty significant property of React.<p>Not only can React on the client &quot;seamlessly&quot; re-use the server-rendered DOM and attach itself like a jQuery plugin would but being able to render the application (and using Redux: render it with an arbitrary state) means you can truly embrace the idea of progressive enhancement without giving up the comfort of web application tooling.<p>Some years ago there was a lot of hype (well, not as much by a long stretch but some hype nevertheless) around the idea of making web apps work without JS (YUI[0] allowing server-side rendering of JS web apps and PJAX[1] enabling web sites to behave more like apps). Instead of mucking around with client-side templates you would render pages on the server and then intercept internal links to fetch and inject only the bits that changed between the current page and the next.<p>React+Redux is basically PJAX, but it&#x27;s also the polar oppsite. Instead of rendering everything using server-side technologies, you render everything using client-side technologies. And instead of offloading re-renders to the server you keep them in the client when possible (where they can be further optimised thanks to DOM diffing).<p>Let me restate that: React+Redux allows you to build &quot;Rich Internet Applications&quot; in a way that makes it possible to support JavaScript-free fallbacks out of the box. There&#x27;s nothing stopping developers from making the HTML output of their React apps richly semantic and accessible either (even though that represents the Eternal War of the web).<p>The idea is not new[2] but with React it&#x27;s not only achievable but <i>easily</i> achievable. And unlike Web Components it only needs existing technologies that are widely supported (it even works in IE8).<p>--<p>The PandaStrike article you linked is not a rebuttal of React. It&#x27;s a rebuttal of traditional client-side web applications. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether they are built with Angular or Backbone or React -- the arguments are mostly universal. The difference is that React is the only option today that (despite not having HTML &quot;templates&quot;) allows developers to do something smarter.<p>Of course React is a land grab. <i>Every</i> open source project is. But it&#x27;s not an attack on the Open Web anymore than jQuery was an attack on the Open Web before querySelectorAll or XMLHttpRequest landed in a spec. That you&#x27;re no longer writing straight-up HTML in a text file doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re no better off than if you were using GWT[3].<p>And who says Web Components are the Right Choice just because they&#x27;re becoming part of the native platform? Sometimes the thing we think we want[4] isn&#x27;t what we really need[5], even if it&#x27;s on track to become a standard.<p>--<p>[0] <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/server-side-rendering-with-yui-on-node-js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxian.com/archives/server-side-rendering-with-yui-o...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://pjax.herokuapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pjax.herokuapp.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/09/30/render-first-js-second/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/09/30/render-first-js-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gwtproject.org/gettingstarted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwtproject.org/gettingstarted.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2014/07/24/object-observe-javascript-api-impact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2014/07/24/object-observe-javascript-ap...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/11/object-observe-withdrawn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/11/object-observe-withdrawn</a>",1448413358

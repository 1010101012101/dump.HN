So let&#x27;s make this an explicit discussion, shall we?<p>What I was trying to say is that contrary to your original statement not every penetration is sexual assault, nor are (in general) sexual acts without explicit consent.<p>Why? Because in Western society, consent is more often than not implicit. People very rarely ask &quot;do you want to have sex with me?&quot; or &quot;May I kiss you?&quot;. Instead, they rely on body language, suggestive statements or simply the knowledge that they&#x27;re in a relationship of which sex is an expected part.<p>Now it is certainly possible that there are societies where this is different and any sexual act must be preceded by explicitly asking for consent. It is possible you live in such a society. That would be very strange to me - which is not a judgement.<p>However, it seems to me more likely that you live in the (mostly same) Western society I do and we&#x27;re merely having different interpretations of how &quot;explicit consent&quot; can be given.",1381579175

I have family in Japan and have observed many times an inability to remember how to write a certain kanji eg. when filling in a form. Typically people will then type the word phonetically on a cell phone or computer, which prompts them with matching kanji, jogging their memory. There is a strong reliance on these technologies or, I suppose, dictionaries, which are also organised phonetically.<p>It is of course the case that English speakers occasionally forget words - I&#x27;ve looked up &quot;diarrhoea&quot; more than once in my life!

6538397,comment,6537587,6538255,10,0,Joeri,,,"<i>Especially if both are drunk.</i><p>I think a large part of the problem is the social acceptance of alcohol and being drunk. Objectively speaking, getting drunk is similar to getting wasted on other (illegal) drugs. Alcohol is a drug which due to an accident of history is legal. The negative consequences of alcohol consumption are ubiquitous. More people die from alcohol than from all illicit drugs combined. If it is wrong to take drugs, it is wrong to drink alcohol, especially to the point of debilitation.<p>Being drunk should not be an extenuating circumstance for bad behavior, it should be an aggravating circumstance. When people choose to drink something which makes them less able to behave in a socially acceptable way, they should be prepared to accept the consequences.",1381578812
6538396,comment,6537587,6537963,3,0,malandrew,,,"I wasn&#x27;t there so I don&#x27;t know, but were her signals only obvious at a distance of a few feet. From the description of the events they were physically close and from what I read she only implied only two non-verbal clues and one verbal clue:<p>(1) Expression on her face as she looked at two male bartenders waiting for them to help.<p>(2) Not reciprocating in the kiss<p>(3) Mentioning that Joe has a wife and children to which he replied “Don’t’ worry about it we have an agreement”.<p>The first one would have been completely missed by Joe because he was caressing her back and kissing her forehead. So that one doesn&#x27;t count as obvious. The second is difficult to say whether it was obvious or not without being party to the kiss. Only Joe and Justine can fairly assess the obviousness of that non-verbal clue. Drunk people tend to kiss pretty poorly, even consenting adults, so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a pretty shitty clue as well. Lastly, the third clue is ambiguous because it is not about what she wants or does not want but what he should or should not be doing. With that statement, she in a way put responsibility to continue or not in Joe&#x27;s hands. If he does in fact have an open relationship with his wife where they can seek out other sexual partners, then to Joe its entirely possible that her sentence could have been misinterpreted as &quot;I&#x27;d like to, but you have something good in your life and I don&#x27;t want <i>you</i> to make a mistake&quot;. That sentence was not about her decision but about his.<p>That all being said, I was definitely inappropriate for Joe to do what he did because of their professional relationship, with him as her superior and her as his subordinate. For that reason, I definitely agree that its a firing-worthy HR violation. However, she is as responsible for unprofessional behavior. In what US country would the following ever be acceptable common workplace conduct:<p><pre><code>    began to start rubbing my back and kissing my forehead (let \n    me say this is not uncommon behavior between me and men I \n    consider close friends. I have a close relationship with a \n    lot of my former EdgeCase coworkers)\n</code></pre>\nOverall, it&#x27;s black and white case of sexual misconduct from an HR perspective, but based on her recollection of the events, its pretty far from a convincing claim that she effectively communicated that she wasn&#x27;t consenting to the only person in the story that matters, Joe. They were two drunk adults who made poor decisions. Both are responsible.",1381578763

In fact, let me quote from one of the links you posted:<p>&quot;The victim of a rape or sexual assault possesses a rare commodity, the knowledge of the crime (Allen, 2007). In most rape and sexual assault cases there is little physical evidence to prove that there was an assault or to differentiate the assault from consensual sexual activity. Consequently, in any rape case, the outcome of the trial is highly dependent on the testimony of the victim. Therefore, victims rely heavily on their own credibility in the eyes of the public. In reporting a rape, victims are opening themselves up to society’s judgment and public scrutiny of their stories.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t even consider the possibility that there might be corraborating witnesses because there generally aren&#x27;t. Also,  the main point of the paper - that women don&#x27;t report they were raped because of the social consequences of doing so - applies even more to writing a blog post about it than it does to reporting it to the police anyway.",1381577161

6538341,comment,6530536,6538142,2,0,pmarca,,,"I agree with your first three paragraphs.<p>On your final point, I think that&#x27;s certainly possible.  At least that&#x27;s the historical cycle.  There are actually a bunch of plausible acquirers at scale -- of the new companies Salesforce and Workday are certainly candidates, and a bunch of the older companies as well -- it will be interesting to see if a new CEO of Microsoft embarks on a major acquisition binge of enterprise cloud companies (perhaps in conjunction with spinning off or killing some of their less-successful consumer efforts).<p>However, it&#x27;s also possible this cycle plays out differently, or at least at much larger scale and over much longer.  The three big arguments in favor of this are:<p>* New enterprise cloud/SAAS vendors may be able to sell into much bigger markets than traditional enterprise software -- since there are many more companies that can use online services than could ever install and use enterprise software on premise.  In particular, going downmarket is far easier with the new model.  Plus, globalization and the developing world could dramatically increase market size.  So new entrants may be able to get much larger as independent companies than the last generation.<p>* New enterprise/SAAS vendors may exist in many more categories than traditional enterprise software.  New development/adoption/business models make it reasonable to think about a lot more horizontal and vertical applications and services than old enterprise software was capable of addressing.  So maybe new vendors get much larger than anticipated since they can cover a lot more functions and verticals, or alternately maybe there are many more new vendors than we can conceive of now.  We are already seeing a trend towards enterprise use of a lot more cloud apps per customer at this point in the cycle than a lot of people expected.<p>* As a consequence of the prior two, the independent market caps of the new cloud/SAAS vendors may end up being a lot higher than you might anticipate from history.  This could really remove the incentive to sell hot new cloud/SAAS vendors as quickly.<p>I think these are live topics right now, and the answers will determine a lot of what happens in the enterprise startup ecosystem for years to come.",1381576917

The guy pushed her away, recoiled in horror and said with a look of despair &quot;she - put - her - tongue - in - my - mouth!?&quot;<p>We laughed but seriously, we knew it wasn&#x27;t consensual, if she went back in we would have pulled her away.<p>I feel this is the correct response to being jumped on. This or a loud no.<p>Not reciprocating, then questioning whether the wife would mind is not a no. Standing there awkwardly waiting for it to be over does not convey stop and it doesn&#x27;t give friends an opportunity to come to the rescue.<p>Without a no the lack of participation can suggest hesitation. Asking about the wife perhaps reinforces this. &quot;Oh so thats why you are slow getting into it. Don&#x27;t worry about her.&quot; From the outside the lack of no and look of awkwardness could suggest this isn&#x27;t something you do very often. Not that you want it to stop.<p>Justine is not at fault in the slightest. Joe forced himself on her. That said I wonder how differently things would have been if she straight up said no or even pushed him away.",1381575615

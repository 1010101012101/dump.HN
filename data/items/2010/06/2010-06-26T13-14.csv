IMHO, such patterns (multiple nesting with empty outer loops), in most cases, are really an indication of just one <i>real</i> loop. Using multiple counters might also be an option.<p>In case the loops <i>are</i> doing something different, they <i>should</i> be indented separately. For instance, the following makes little sense:<p>for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {<p>foo (i);<p>for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) {<p><pre><code>     foo (i + j);

People do harvest addresses from web pages but there are enough other ways spammers get addresses that you need a robust filter in any case; once you have something like SpamAssassin or Google's filters, the value of keeping your address private disappears.<p>[1] That also yielded the interesting datapoint that hotmail used to sell addresses to spammers in early last decade as the first spam arrived within 20 minutes to a long, random address created with the ""don't publish my info"" option.",1277560198

On the other hand, if you try to limit a program's memory usage, it can take up to O(2^n) time to detect that a program with budget of n bits terminates (it might seem easier than that, but the program can go into an infinite loop without overflowing memory, like ""while (1) {}""). You must consider that such a program can never have more than one state for each possible configuration of its allowed memory space (which is 2^n) and you can tell that it is in and infinite loop only when it repeats a previously used state. To do that correctly, then, takes a long time.<p>Incidentally, this is why PSPACE (the class of decision problem decidable in a turing machine with polynomially limited space) seems a lot more powerful than P (the set of decision problems decidable using a polynomial amount of time).",1277558742

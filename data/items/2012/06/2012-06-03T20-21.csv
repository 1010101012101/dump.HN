Consider this for size, the exact same article replacing compassion with gullibility (and few changed sentences) to make the exact same case.<p>========<p>Humans take pride in solving problems.<p>Better products and better solutions mean a better life. Intelligence is considered the fuel that propels humanity forward. After all intelligence is what makes us different from other animals. If you are not intelligent (and that includes creativity) you will be considered a failure.<p>Why is our society obsessed with intelligence?<p>It creates science and technology which is used to amplify our human emotions, whether positive or negative. Progress, fueled by intelligence as a single driving force only, is like driving a car without GPS. There is no guidance system that will take humanity to a better place.  Just having better and faster iPads and HDTVs will not help humanity.<p>Our human mind is capable of more than just intelligent problem solving. It has a capacity to feel accept things because it feels good. gullibility is the untapped potential of the human mind that can be effectively used to feel happy without care for reality. Our world is plagued with problems that can not be solved by intelligence alone.<p>We need more gullibility in this world.<p>I would like to imagine a different world. A world where we give as much importance to gullibility as we do to  intelligence. How would that world look like ? Lets imagine it together.<p>In this world, gullibility is considered a skill that can be developed similar to our analytical skills.<p>Gullibility Quotient (GQ) will be invented to quantify the level of gullibility in an individual. Psychology departments would create better and accurate ways to quantify and improve gullibility.<p>When a new baby is born, parents will make their babies more gullibilityate by showing them pictures of gullibile people and telling them stories that will inspire gullibility. Parents would become more curious and excited to find out their  childrens GQs.<p>Parents will purchase Baby Glenn Beck toys along with Baby Einstein toys for their kids.<p>Schools will test their students on gullibility and report to parents if they find a low GQ.<p>Financial sectors will update their rating systems and rate companies on their gullibility, socially responsible business practices and profitability.<p>Gullibility Deficiency Syndrome (GDS) will be treated just like other disorders that affects peoples lives, such as  alcoholism or depression. Patients will enroll into GD clinics to improve their gullibility levels.<p>It is time for us to take gullibility seriously in every aspect of our lives. We want to free it from the shackles of reason and view it as a necessary human skill. Lets do it together and start now, gullibily.",1338756615

Couldn't have been that much as he was so young.<p>I think this post is missing a larger point. You don't need to get to the point that ""creating and shipping products is muscle memory"". You just need to ship products. We've all seen the examples of Rovio (60+ products before a hit) or Id  (4 products before hit?). And there's probably also plenty of examples of first product hits as well. Seems like important part is shipping. Not being a master of your craft.<p>Of course maybe that's not what people want to hear and I certainly would like to know tips that would make it more likely that the things I ship, write, create will be well received and popular but I can certainly name many products, libraries, app that are not the product of ""someone with a finely honed craft.""<p>And so that's the true story.

4061623,comment,4061156,4061347,1,0,Dove,,,"Sort of.  The strength of a password, at the most basic level, is based on the number of passwords it <i>could have been</i>.  That is to say, the number of live possibilities in your password-generating algorithm.<p>In theory, large alphabets and long passwords lead to increased password strength because they mean your password could have been many other things.  In practice, the vast majority of those other things were never live possibilities, so the password is not that strong even if it is long or the symbol set is large.<p>For example, suppose you choose to base your password on your dog's name, Rover.  This is one of maybe half a dozen likely choices for you, so is not a strong password.  If you modify it for length and symbol set into Fetch4meRover!, this is <i>still</i> one of maybe a dozen things you would have chosen to do with the name, so is still not that strong in spite of the length and character set.<p>In general, you should not trust yourself to generate random information, and particularly passwords.  Use a script to randomly generate a password -- a script with a <i>known</i> large number of live possibilities.  This is the only way to ensure those possibilities -- the ones that make a password secure -- were ever actually live.",1338753677

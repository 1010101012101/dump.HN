These little steps will hopefully <i>eventually</i> bring change to Nigeria.<p>SIDENOTE: Tiny correction to that video(Audio @2:09) Lagos is no longer the official capital of Nigeria, the government reassigned that title to Abuja.

Unless a <i>whole lot</i> has changed since 2008, they seemed pretty well soaked in Nigerian culture.

6532325,comment,6531864,6531864,8,0,rayiner,,,"The justice system is a system, in the engineering sense of the word. Like any system in real life, its design involves balancing. The negative impact of false convictions is weighed against the cost and practicality of measures to avoid false convictions. Prosecutors have broad immunity from suit because otherwise the system would be unworkable. Every aggrieved convict would sue his prosecutor for anything he could think of.<p>The context of this case is a suit for money damages against prosecutors for &quot;concealing&quot; exculpatory evidence. You can&#x27;t take the word &quot;concealing&quot; at face value. Prosecutors make judgment calls every day about whether evidence is important or not. This case took place long before DNA testing was either effective or common. Prosecutors could have legitimately known about it and considered it &quot;not potentially exculpatory.&quot; Scalia&#x27;s quote from Youngblood simply says that prosecutors can&#x27;t be sued for such judgment calls unless it can be shown they were not acting in good faith.<p>One of my big beefs with articles like this one is that they paint everything in hindsight. But if you create a duty on the part of prosecutors to not be negligent, you can&#x27;t just hear the cases that are neatly wrapped in a package by some wrongful convictions organization. Negligence is a factual determination, and in criminal cases the defendant is entitled to have such facts tried in front of a jury. Convicts will sue saying the police should have swabbed beneath the carpet or whatever, and you have to give them full process.<p>As an aside, I came across a case yesterday. It&#x27;s only salience is that it it&#x27;s close to home and quite recent. It involves a couple who goes on vacation, leaving their three youngest children with a neighbor (husband and wife). When they return, two of the children, girls, tell them that they were sexually assaulted by the husband, Joe. The police work with the father, Michael, and talk Joe into coming over to Michael&#x27;s house on the premise that he just wants to talk. Joe makes incriminating statements about the sexual assault to Michael, in the presence of the Chief of Police. When Michael decides to press charges, Joe goes ballistic. He stalks the police chief, and the day before his trial goes to Michael&#x27;s place of work and shoots him in the head. See: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1915239094303815276&q=stacey+walters&hl=en&as_sdt=4,108,123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1915239094303815...</a>.<p>Nobody is going to write an LA Times Article about Joe Stacey and Michael Walter, about the wife left without a husband, the ten children left without a father, or the two girls who will carry the scars of sexual assault at the hands of someone they trusted.",1381488434
6532324,comment,6531030,6531312,2,0,oelmekki,,,"To avoid that, I check origin script url, as all my scripts are within the &quot;/assets&quot; path :<p><pre><code>    window.onerror = function( error, url, lineno ){\n      if ( url && url.match( //https?:\/\/.*?assets/ ) ){\n        # error management\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis ensure only relevant errors are included, discarding errors from extensions, trackers, gmaps, etc.<p>Of course if you inline js for performance on production code, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>EDIT : an other important thing to avoid flooding is to handle amount of error. Javascript errors rarely come alone. An error within an event callback may be triggered several times before user surrenders. And let not even start with error within setInterval. To avoid this, I usually use a `error_got` counter and simply silence error reporting for the  current page / context when I&#x27;ve got more than 5 errors.<p>And about user surrendering. Reporting errors is nice. Preventing user to get stuck is better. I always automatically disable all callbacks in onerror and let default html actions on links and form being process. This ensure user intent will be fulfilled and page context will be reloaded as a bonus.

All the various from state access to &quot;private&quot; communications, social networks becoming more public and all the different miscellaneous privacy issues are all different aspects or consequences of the Thing.<p>The move towards complete availability of all digital information seems to be a force of history. Privacy advocates are beginning to sound like copyright advocates, demanding that the universe continue providing for them in the manner to which they have grown accustomed.<p>Like copyright/IP, privacy is more about use getting used to (and in some cases legislating) how things happen to be, not predesigned or derived from first principle rules or morality. If 99% of your existence occurs within a community of 150 people, very little is private. When you live in a 20th center city, you get a lot of anonymity. You can keep private life (even several of these) separate from your professional life. etc. Those were just inevitable consequences of how those societies were structured.<p>The internet was at first an anonymous place. Pre-2000 most people seemed to share the feeling that if their real name found its way to the world wide web, serial killers would come. Then 2000-2005 people started keeping online diaries, online photo libraries, online lots of personal information. Facebook catalyzed this process with a semi private system of friends that matched what people were used to in their normal lives.<p>The force of history that is &#x27;all your data available to everyone everywhere&#x27; feels unstoppable. Data is data. It doesn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s an email, SMS, baby photo or GPS log. It doesn&#x27;t get deleted.<p>Maybe &quot;Information wants to be free&quot; was an understatement.<p>I feel very awkward trying to describe this, a clear sign that I don&#x27;t understand it. I wish pg Joel Spolsky, Chris Anderson (or ideally, Douglas Adams - I really wish we still had him) or someone else who&#x27;s good at this sort of abstract thing would write a good piece on it.",1381486949

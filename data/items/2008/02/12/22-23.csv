So, for instance, I tend to avoid doing a lot of SQL queries, which might be handy, because scaling that requires lots of SQL server machines.<p>3) In the old days (10 years ago, when I self-funded Lyris, which eventually became a success) a big problem I had was getting licenses to technology (C++ libraries, database servers) but these days open source replaces all that.<p>4) doing without employees. That's both a benefit in the near-term, as I have to learn how to do everything lean and well, but a disadvantage if there are rote tasks to do now as we scale.  With BookMooch, I've managed to get volunteers to do those rote tasks, but with Magnatune, I got 3 not-very-well-paid part timers.<p>- John Buckman",1202857173

114403,comment,113901,114008,0,0,teach,,,"[Disclaimer: I've been teaching computer science at the high  school level for nearly eleven years now.  My B.S. is in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin, and I set the curve in some of my courses.]<p>I hesitate to disparage the analysis of an anecdotal person I've never met, but I disagree with the claim that statistically teacher quality doesn't affect student outcome.<p>The current leading meta-statistical analysis of teachers and teaching methods and their effect on student learning is ""Classroom Instruction that Works"", by Marzano, et al.  They have statistics on good teacher/bad school, good teacher/good school, bad teacher/good school and bad teacher/bad school and the effect on student performance.  The average effect size when comparing multiple studies shows that good teachers <i>do</i> make a significant and measurable difference in student achievement.<p>I think leaving teaching to ""people who can't do anything else"" is a cop-out.  I've taught the basics of programming to over 1000 students in my career thus far.  I know of at least a dozen who now do it for a living, including some who say that a career in programming never crossed their mind before taking my class.  Do you think I've had a net positive effect on the industry?  I can write a lot of code, but teaching others to code eventually produces more.  ""Teach a man to fish"" and all that.<p>I do agree with Prrometheus below that a lot of public education is ""an inflexible, pathological bureaucracy.""<p>I also agree that if you don't enjoy working with young people, don't bother.  Further, if you can't set healthy boundaries, you'll eventually get burned out.  Also, if you're a hacker at heart, you'll need to keep coding somehow, or you'll go mad.<p>Of course, I don't know anything about Teach for America either, but I do know that I really enjoy teaching, and I'm glad I went that route rather than industry or starting something of my own.<p>Just my two cents.",1202856920

Since we both run Starmen.Net (<a href=""http://starmen.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starmen.net</a>) we figured that we can just do the same, except bigger and for all games. (btw, Starmen.Net is the reason why Earthbound is a 'cult hit') Reid is taking care of all the financials himself.<p>We have three very great reasons why we believe we can self-fund ourselves: 1) Reid invested in a little known company called Apple quite awhile go. We have enough money to live on our own and work 100% on Fangamer only. 2) We already have built a community, Starmen.Net. Since we're adding on, we don't have to go through the hassle of starting to get people to an unknown site. Due to the crazy media stuff that Starmen.Net does (<a href=""http://starmen.net/ebanthology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starmen.net/ebanthology/</a>), we have a lot of media contacts in the gaming industry. 3) Since Starmen.Net is donation funded, we already have servers and everything paid for. We run our own  private server, so we have a great resource to start out on.<p>I suppose I could add a shameless blog mention ;) <a href=""http://fangamer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fangamer.com/</a>",1202856098

114393,comment,114310,114310,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Self-funded.  We're not averse to taking outside capital, but I want to make sure we don't take money until the right time in our company's lifecycle.  Given how many times our assumptions have been proven wrong, I don't think we've reached that point - I like having the freedom to change directions and try a different tack without having to justify it to investors & staff.  I've been an early employee in a couple funded companies that were at roughly the same point in development that we are, and was always struck by how stupid management was.  This way we can be stupid and correct for it without getting caught in the blame/frustration cycle that overtakes a lot of VC-funded companies.  Investors probably also appreciate us not spending their money making mistakes; I doubt we could get funding at this point if we tried.<p>I've been working full-time for 4 months (+ 9 months with a day job), my cofounder still has his day job but is quitting in a month or two.  I'm still in my 20s and saved up a whole lot of money from my last job, so we could go for quite a while like this.<p>Everyone's completely right about the reduced effectiveness of moonlighting; in my experience, a 10x drop in productivity is not unusual.  Also, I've found that there are some projects that you just can't do while employed elsewhere, because you can't load the whole project into your head on just nights and weekends.  The two sites we released while I was still employed were basically dead in the cradle, because they don't solve anything that hundreds of other sites haven't already solved.  Quitting has given me the time & attention to pursue much more ambitious coding projects.<p>Also, those cost figures seem high.  We spend $80/month or hosting and make about $60 back on advertising, so it basically pays for itself.",1202855977

Just because you have no idea how to do those things, don't fall into the trap of assuming that a V.C. does know how to do them / is willing to roll up his sleeves and do the hard work.  Most VCs, despite constant blogging of how many hours they work, are actually quite lazy and allergic to work.<p>Actually, though they'll never tell you, and often say the opposite on their websites, VCs view big time involvement in your day to day business as a sign of trouble - ideally they want to sit on their rear ends, visit you once a month and tell you to ""optimize the radical paradigm shift"" then go home and write a blog about their value added and entrepreneurs should be grateful they have VCs telling them how to do such things.<p>When they actually do have to get involved, they'll do so as the article suggests and ""punish you"" by shoving ""their team"" in your startup with a ""see what you made me do?  See what happens when you make me break a sweat?"" attitude.<p>IN CONCLUSION: Just because you don't know it, doesn't mean you should assume that some smug, confident-looking guy sitting across the table from you (the VC) DOES know how to do it.  For all you know he might be as clueless as you.<p>There was an awesome article on this subject from about 10 years ago called something like, ""The pussification of silicon valley""",1202855939

I think another study said the number was closer to 80%, but again their methodology was poor.<p>I don't buy this.  That this study covers two million people doesn't mean it is representative, because these were people that <i>filled in an online survey and talked about their attitudes and intentions</i>.

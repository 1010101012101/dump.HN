The ruling is not that all GIS mapping data is public; it applies to a specific chunk of GIS mapping data.<p>The ruling says that when the California government maintains GIS data, it falls under &quot;public records&quot;, and furthermore that GIS data (unlike GIS software) does not fall under the &quot;software&quot; exemption to the rules for &quot;public records&quot;.  As such, the government may not charge a licensing fee for its use.<p>This does not affect GIS data in the possession of private enterprises.<p>IANAL, TINLA.",1373972377

They also didn&#x27;t have a group which was given the same number of calories from a different source (as far as I know) so it&#x27;s possible that eating a chunk of meat would have the same effect. What I thought was interesting actually was that they were able to demonstrate beneficial effects from intake of calories directly on brain function.<p>As I wrote that, I did remember a bit of evidence that the glucose was actually beneficial - namely that they measured performance on the problems over time. At the end of the first set, both groups were showing approximately equal degraded performance. Upon resuming on the second set, the group given glucose was back up to nearly the starting level of proficiency, while the group given no glucose was at the same level they stopped at on the first group.",1373972251

The only reason why its working for him, is his fame. And even that won&#x27;t be put up by any guy who has problems giving away his self esteem.<p>Around 3 years back I worked under two very technically brilliant people, but their biggest problem was just the kind of stuff you see here. I remember the entire team would change every 6 months. The team was supposed to be some kind of an elite hand picked team from within the whole company, as they were supposed to focus on big revenue based projects. But I saw some awesome people, leave every 3-6 months of joining just because it was impossible to work with those two people. &#x27;Do you know how he behaved yesterday with person X&#x27; kind of lunch/coffee table discussions were simply too common.<p>I recently happened to meet a guy who just left that team. He recalled the impossibility of working with those two people. Something that we both noticed, those two haven&#x27;t seem to have anything substantial in the past decade. Almost any project that they touch crashes and burns and ever never proceeds anywhere beyond 30-50% mark.<p>The thing is plain and simple. You have no rights to behave that way with anyone(No matter who you are). Secondly, anybody who is good has no reason to put up with you, Why should they? So the net-net is these are team destroying activities.<p>If you are good, and then that is that. What can you do without a team in software these days?<p>Never resort to a impolite public engagement. Your best bet is to be calm(even in case of a big goof up) take the person to a room and explain to him the seriousness of his mistake and help him avoid making such mistakes in the future.",1373969948

If you hear a &quot;but&quot; coming, there are a couple questions that I can&#x27;t answer, since I don&#x27;t know Linus (personally) and I don&#x27;t know what the relationship between Linus and the maintainers in the two examples are.  These may be unpopular questions, but perhaps someone who knows can answer.<p>1)  I hear plenty of foul and seemingly abusive language happen between friends.  Are the examples given seem more abusive because we assume the parties are merely acquaintances?  I also didn&#x27;t take the time to follow the e-mail threads to see how the conversation started.<p>2)  I remember once when I was 17 or 18, I heard someone swearing through a sentence (that should have been a good point in the conversation) and immediately thought they were a dullard.  Then I realized that people might have the same perception of me and I quit swearing almost immediately.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you find the curse words acceptable, the reality is that I can still verbally abuse someone using perfect grammar and &quot;tenpenny&quot; words.  If the banter is not good-natured banter, how do you define verbal abuse?<p>3)  Are Linus&#x27; responses to these e-mails simply indicative of the passion that&#x27;s also let him lead the creation and fostering of Linux over the last 20 years?  Would someone without that passion (whether using foul language or not) have succeeded in such a broad endeavor?<p>4)  Are the supposed victims of the described abuse speaking out about this?  I would assume that if they were truly offended, they would have told at least a few people, but I haven&#x27;t seen any indication that they were offended.  Linux isn&#x27;t some dictatorial regime - have people &quot;left the empire&quot; (quit kernel development) because of this behavior?<p>5)  Are the threads containing harsh criticisms balanced by e-mails pointing out how brilliantly someone solved an issue?  It&#x27;s more acceptable to rant about a mistake if you also rave over something extraordinary.<p>6)  Has Linus ever lambasted himself publicly over his own mistakes?  I tend to think any code I wrote over six months ago is pretty crappy (it&#x27;s a perfectionist thing).<p>I can&#x27;t condone verbal abuse, though I&#x27;ve seen similar abuse in person and in a professional environment, but I also can&#x27;t say this is abuse without knowing the complete context.  I tend to think personal attacks are out of place, but commentary on the technology can be as pleasant or harsh as necessary.<p>Linus:  If you happen to read this, first I&#x27;d like to thank you for the work you&#x27;ve done.  In some ways, I&#x27;ve grown my career as a side-effect of your work.

If you look at the successes and failures of AI listed in the article, modern AI is well suited for sensory recognition and pattern matching, and it&#x27;s bad at cognitive reasoning in the abstract - just as it has always been. There are logical reasoners, of course, but they can only reason about whatever the programmer has put previously in the system as inference rules.<p>Now letting a robot roam around the premises wouldn&#x27;t be much different than feeding it with slides of sensory stimuli.<p>The kind of experiences that the bot could only learn from moving around are beyond its sense-making; it can&#x27;t gain any significant advantage from having wheels and hands and chasing the environment, because it doesn&#x27;t know how to use them to enhance its knowledge and learn new kinds of things, in the way that a toddler can.<p>The only approach I know that seems promising in that respect is IBM&#x27;s Watson - I&#x27;m not sure how it works exactly, but even if it&#x27;s doing basic pattern recognition, the huge scale of parallel process and the enormous data corpus that it&#x27;s feeded into Watson &#x27;&#x27;might&#x27;&#x27; just be what it takes to achieve sense-making in an emergent way.",1373969193

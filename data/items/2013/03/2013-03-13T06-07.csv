5367200,comment,5365096,5365816,3,0,qznc,,,"I once heard a quote like this ""programming languages are frozen knowledge about software engineering"". (Anybody got a clue who said something like this?)<p>New languages usually improve upon older languages by making certain errors impossible by design. For example, Go allows pointers, but not pointer arithmetic. With C we learned pointer arithmetic is often harmful (though sometimes necessary), so Java removed pointers from the language (not completely, though). Go takes a sensible middle way, because no pointers sometimes is ugly. Such a clean slate is good, because with older languages programmers fight their language deficiencies with habits (e.g. if (5 == x) instead of if (x == 5) to prevent if (x = 5)).<p>On the other hand, we will find the pitfalls and dark corners of Go over time, but currently we do not know them enough. Go will acquire its own conventions, but we do not know all of them yet. This is the risk of a clean slate.",1363157601
5367199,comment,5363003,5363964,1,0,dschiptsov,,,"This is just a propaganda - repetitive reciting of slogans made of long words.)<p>It is, of course, difficult to argue with zealots, but I will try nevertheless.)<p>The cost of what is called ""advanced type system"" is inability to put an elements of different types in the same list or tuple or whatever. It is not just a feature, it is a limitation. In some cases, when you, for example, dealing only with numbers, say, positive integers, it is OK, but what then the real advantage of such type checking?<p>On the other case, the concept of a pointer which all those ""packers"" trying to throw away is very mind-natural. When we have a box we could put anything in it, as long as it fits. Imagine what a disaster it would be when you moving from one flat to another but must pack stuff only into special kind of boxes. This one is only for such kind of shoes, this is only for spoons, that for forks. So, with a pointer we could ""pick up"" everything, and then decide what it is and where it goes.<p>Another mind friendly concept is using symbols and synonyms to refer to thing - s symbolic pointers. It is how our minds work. Those who are able of thinking in more than one language know that we could refer to it using different words, but ""inner representation"" is one and the same.<p>These two simple ideas - using pointers (references) and have data (""representation"") to define itself (type-tagging is another great idea - it is labeling) gives you a very natural way of programming. It is a mix of so-called ""data-directed"" and ""declarative"" and, as long as you describe a transformation rules instead of imperative step-by-step processes, ""functional"" styles.<p>Of course, the code will look in a certain way - there will be lots of case-analysis, like unpacking things form a big box - oh, this is a book - it goes to a shelf, it is a computer speakers, it goes on the table, etc. But that's OK, it is natural.<p>The claims that ""packing"" is the best strategy is, of course, nonsense. Trying to mimic natural processes in our mind (as lousy as we could do it) is, in my opinion, has some sense.<p>There are some good ideas behind each language and not so good. Symbolic computation, pattern matching, data-description (what s-expression, or yaml is) are good ones. Static typing, describing ""properties"" instead of ""behavior"" - not so.)<p>Also it is good to remember that we're programming computers, not VMs. There is something called ""machine representation"" which is, well, just bits. It doesn't mean to swing into another extreme and program in assembly, but it is advisable to stay close to hardware, especially when it is not that difficult.<p>Everything is built from pointers, you like it or not.) The idea to throw them away is insane, the idea (a discipline) of not doing math on them is much better. The idea of avoiding over-writing is a great one, it is good even for paper and pencil - everything become a mess very quickly, but avoiding all mutation is, of course, madness.<p>So, finding the balance is the difficult task, and it is certainly not Haskell. Classic Lisps came close, but it requires some skill to appreciate the beauty.) So, the most popular languages are the ugliest ones.",1363157584

Musicians can play live; that doesn't work very well for film directors or actors.

One issue is the list of pointers on each node. This could be kept as a separate list attribute (another 2 mallocs, slack, list overallocation etc), or perhaps arranged so that ""$max_levels"" types exist, each with attributes to cover a particular level. In any case since I wanted CPython compatibility, the horrid list trade-off is the best I could find.<p>You raise an interesting topic, I got into Python around the 2.2 era  almost entirely due to the ""cleanliness"" factor, but features quickly began to appear that seemed redundant in some way, and the general popularity of the language meant its philosophy became increasingly dilute. Basically whatever ""obviousness"" the language had is eroded by varying degrees of pomp and ceremony, e.g. ""idiomatic"" use of crazy stuff like metaclasses, decorators <i>everywhere</i>, or nested list comprehensions containing perlish conditional expressions.<p>It seems healthier to look at Python less as some bastion of beauty and more a slightly prettier glue language, like a perl 2.0. From this angle it becomes an interesting macro language for combining chunks of C in interesting ways. You can write some awesomely fast, concise code with abuse of buffer(), itertools and functools.partial, but none of it looks particularly ""Pythonic"" or ""beautiful"". Nonetheless the resulting code is among the best in its class in terms of performance/size/maintainability compromise, yet the community at large would likely reject it as abhorrent.<p>I guess this code snippet is a good example of that.",1363156986

US, border to border, from crossroads to the largest cities, the US is just awash in sole proprietorships.  They mow grass, run 12 fast food restaurants, repair cars, run 10 gas stations with convenience stores, run Italian red sauce restaurants, are dentists, pediatricians, etc.  One owner, zero to a few hundred employees.  So, sole founder, one owner works fine, millions of times across the US, in business.<p>Now, for an information technology startup, that's just an advantage, at least through a business of similar size.  If a guy running 10 pizza shops can be a solo founder, then a guy running a Web site or writing an app can also.<p>Technical knowledge?  It takes a lot of technical knowledge to repair, correctly, efficiently any car that drives in to an auto repair shop or auto body shop or be up to date on dentistry, pediatrics, etc.  Information technology is not nearly the only field that needs technical knowledge.<p>For an information technology startup, it stands to help if the founder, CEO actually understands the work.  The best way for him to do this is to do the work.  There actually doing the work may not take so much time and, instead, getting the background, say, 4000 Web pages of documentation from Microsoft's MSDN, can take more time.  But if he is going to understand the work, then he needs the background.  So, given the background, go ahead and do the work.  Later, when there's plenty of revenue and more work to do, start hiring.<p>If the project grows well past a 'life style' business to a big thing, fine, but still I see no great reason to have more than one founder.<p>I can guess why some venture investors want more than one founder.",1363156135

In an open space the best your going to do is sound masking, which is nothing more than shaped white noise to drown out the other sounds, aircraft engines already do a pretty good job of this with the exception that their frequency spectrum can be a bit annoying.<p>On the other hand, you can do structural vibration cancellation to reduce outside (engine, air) noise entering the cabin.

It has got to strain the player somehow.",1363154837

In theory there are some things that are genuinely scarce (e.g. energy or specific elements) but so what? Most of them have substitutes, and the fewer labor costs have to be paid the more substitutes become viable.

You might want to hire a real logo designer or illustrator to get that working.<p>* ""Location"" looks like the header of the details box as you're visually connecting them.<p>As a student:<p>* I like the idea, and I can immediately see the use case,<p>* but the intent is unclear in having ""duration"". Deadlines don't, and it feels like you're trying to replicate google calendar. Removing that ability would make it more clear that it's essentially a deadline app.<p>* I have different kinds of assignments, so for example this does not work very well for assignments other than those on paper.<p>* I want to be able to take a photo of the assignment sheet (there is almost always one) and attach it to the deadline.<p>* Better yet, do OCR on the sheet and fill the deadline for me. That's tricky, but not impossible to get 90% right.<p>* New Due Date is unclear. I'm not adding due dates, I'm adding assignments.<p>* There is no point in having a global class name search for a single user.<p>* It's unclear if the global names listed here are attached to specific universities.

1217379,comment,1217305,1217305,0,0,_delirium,,,"An intriguing idea. As someone pointed out, it wouldn't really be ""open source"", since it includes a restriction on reuse that all the major definitions of free software and open source (the FSF's, Debian's, OSI's) would considered impermissible. But it could be called something else. It's sort of the flip-side of the ""non-commercial use only"" licenses: commercial-use only, with a definition of what minimum level constitutes sufficiently commercial use.<p>One practical problem is that it seems it'd only work within relatively stable, narrowly defined markets. The specified minimum price may make no sense if someone takes the code and uses it to make an app in a different market, or on a different platform.",1269478420

1217369,comment,1216834,1216834,0,0,lmkg,,,"What immediately comes to mind when I read this is the original Half-Life, and how it has a complete narrative, told mostly through the environment. There's no pre-mission briefing or cut-scenes, and very little dialogue. You simply experience the word, and that world makes sense. It barely even tells a story; it's more like you see the story that the world came from.<p>Portal, despite having more words and more dialogue, still comes from a very similar vein of narrative. The dialogue doesn't tell you the story, it gets you acquainted with the (complex) character of Glados. The story is still told by experiencing the environment, and realizing the world that environment is a part of. The bulk of the story is <i>implied</i> between the lines.<p>Yahtzee recently railed against the whole audio-log gimmick[1] you often see nowadays as ways of advancing the narrative. I think it overlaps a lot with this essay. I don't mind a story being told explicitly, but (some?) games don't need such explicit methods to tell their stories. As an aside, I feel that Bioshock, despite having audio logs, is a true successor to Half Life in using the environment to tell a story and set a scene, because its environment is so detailed and an integral part of the story its telling. 90% of the audio logs could be removed and the story would stand on its own. Nonetheless, the audio logs added to the game by providing characters that could not easily fit into the game environment during gameplay, and those characters helped characterize the world the game was set in.<p>I don't feel that words are inherently wrong in a video game. However, I do think that relying on overly verbose methods of storytelling isn't taking the fullest advantage of video games' unique qualities as a medium. It's like a design smell: it's not inherently wrong and there are good reasons for doing so on occassion, it just means you should step back and take a critical eye of whether you <i>really</i> need it or if you're better off not doing including that content, or doing it in another way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/7289-Extra-Punctuation-On-Audio-Logs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-...</a>",1269478160

It really isn't. The author was writing for an English-speaking audience and tried to make an analogy to something familiar to English speakers. But the Chinese language actually doesn't have the category of voice in its verbal system at all, and the è¢« construction is better described as an ""adversative"" construction. I learned this from the authoritative Chinese grammar textbook by the late Chinese linguist Y. R. Chao while an undergraduate student of Chinese.<p>In Chinese in the most recent century, mistranslation of Western writings with passive voice constructions by the è¢« construction (whether or not the Western passive constructions have an adversative meaning) tempts a lot of casual observers to suppose that today's Chinese uses è¢« simply as a marker of passive voice. But I have many times tried out, as part of personal linguistic fieldwork, newly composed sentences that use è¢« as a straight-up translation of normally grammatical sentences in English, and the Chinese sentences are regarded as ungrammatical unless the è¢« construction can plausibly be construed as adversative.<p>(I just Googled for a good Web reference about this, but didn't find one quite to my satisfaction.)",1269476957

I can't see this working with modern big-name games. (Some day it will, but at that point the modern big-name games will have moved on.)<p>2) Video games should have less text and go with other ways of conveying stuff.<p>This would be better written as ""games which don't use much text can be lots of fun"". I don't think a stronger thesis can easily be supported.<p>Zelda games since Link to the Past have used more text than the original, but they've also told stories that wouldn't have been possible without it.<p>Metroid Prime doesn't have much text unless you go around scanning things. But that's also where the plot comes from. The world is atmospheric by itself, but atmosphere doesn't tell us how the world came to be like it is.<p>I would love to see a story and characters as intricate as (say) Final Fantasy VI conveyed without much text, but I just don't see it happening.<p>There are games which can be communicated well without using text and there are those which can't.

The CCP and their decisions have been credited for China's stellar growth because the CCP say it is so. I get the impression more than anything else that the policies related to kaifang (funny how they use house in that word) is the primary cause for China's growth. Everything else the CCP does is secondary to just the plain economic power you unleash by opening up China to the global market.<p>It makes perfect sense, of course, for the CCP to lay claim to all the growth.

And <i>then</i> - and only then - they can argue that they're responsible for economic growth.

3015700,comment,3015479,3015558,5,0,cwp,,,"Actually, I've come around to the idea that homeopathy is a brilliant piece of social engineering. The theory of homeopathy is simple, internally consistent and not obviously false, which makes it a good way to harness the placebo effect without lying to the patient. The whole idea that diluting medecine makes it more effective has a number of benefits as well:<p>Concentration/dilution is a simple, objective, physical property that can be measured for any medicine. It's much easier to think and talk about than wishy-washy concepts like ""effectiveness in clinical trials.""<p>Diluting medicines down to really low concentrations take sophisticated equipment, so it's legitimate to charge more for those medicines. By agreeing to pay more for less, patients can strengthen their belief and actually increase the effectiveness of the placebo.<p>The preoccupation with dilution also makes homeopathy safer. At the extreme, patients are being prescribed purified water. No side effects!<p>Dilution also mitigates any other harmful effects that the homeopathic industry might have on the world. A few leaves of St. John's Wart go a loooong way when they're diluted down to 1 part per million. Out-of-control homeopathy won't lead to, say, increased poaching of bears and tigers for their internal organs.<p>The whole thing is brilliant.",1316476539

In other words, being part of the experimental group is more important than the placebo or actual drug being tested.<p>If these drugs are then available via normal channels, I imagine the placebo drug is not distributed, and the results may also not be monitored anymore.<p>Is there any indication whether this happens?

This included tumour reduction.<p>In the light of this, the placebo effect does not seem so far-fetched.<p>My personal theory is that when an animal feels safe and secure in a non-threatening environment, the immune system is stimulated, because the immune system requires resources, and the body can spare these when it is safe. When volunteers are given placebos, in a controlled and professional setting, it is clearly a safe and stress-free environment.

3015641,comment,3015198,3015411,4,0,wtallis,,,"You have to understand the history in order to understand why there's a distinction. If it weren't for all the Java programmers who've tried to get rich off the App Store in the past several years, there wouldn't be much need for a distinction. However, too many of the Java programmers that have been jumping on the Objective-C bandwagon have never before had to give any consideration to memory management. Thus they had trouble learning to use the Cocoa manual explicit reference counting paradigm, which requires the application programmer to know where to make calls to -retain and -release.<p>This requirement that the application programmer participate in memory management contributes more to the distinction than the fact that the Cocoa reference counting scheme imposes less runtime overhead than most robust garbage collectors of the sort used by Java or Python.<p>The new <i>Automatic Reference Counting</i> used by Cocoa is still different from traditional garbage collectors, because it is implemented without imposing any more runtime overhead than the manual scheme. ARC is essentially a preprocessor phase that infers (based on coding conventions) where to place the calls to -retain and -release. None of the complex logic for tracking the lifetime of an object is done at runtime. It's done at compile time, if at all. (ARC differs from full-fledged robust garbage collectors like what Java has in that ARC can't handle situations like cycles in the object graph. Handling those cycles is one of the main things that makes writing a high-performance Java-like GC non-trivial, but ARC simply chooses to not be <i>that</i> automatic.)",1316475424

Alternatively, working against it was the concern they were getting the placebo and likelihood of getting worse. (Ie 1/2 odds at recovering)<p>But, as studies showed that even those receiving placebos were getting better patients came to realize that even if they were getting the placebo treatment they could still get better. So now, the placebo has working for it the patients hope of getting the treatment and getting better plus the hope that in the case they get the placebo they experience the placebo effect and get better anyways. Alternatively, placebo effect now only has working against it the ""off chance"" that if the patient gets the placebo he also does not experience the placebo effect. (Ie 2/3 odds at recovering)<p>Now, start with press releases like this and start stating that the placebo is so powerful, it always works--so much so we aren't going to bother giving the real drug to trial patients any more and just give them all sugar pills.. Then you'll get to watch placebo patients start consistently out performing trial drug patients at health recovery that eventually the above statement will be true.<p>And while I wrote this comment in good humor, I do think it's a valid argument that circular logic explains that the placebo effect is getting stronger because of the placebo effect (people believing in it).

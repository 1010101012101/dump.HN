469940,comment,469831,469831,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This guy has gone to the zoo and interviewed all the animals. The tiger says that the secret to success is to live alone, be well disguised, have sharp claws and know how to stalk. The snail says that the secret is to live inside a solid shell, stay small, hide under dead trees and move slowly around at night. The parrot says that success lies in eating fruit, being alert, packing light, moving fast by air when necessary, and always sticking by your friends.<p>His conclusion: These animals are giving contradictory advice! And that's because they're all ""outliers"".<p>But both of these points are subtly misleading. Yes, the advice is contradictory, but that's only a problem if you imagine that the animal kingdom is like a giant arena in which all the world's animals battle for the Animal Best Practices championship [1], after which all the losing animals will go extinct and the entire world will adopt the winning ways of the One True Best Animal. But, in fact, there are a hell of a lot of different ways to be a successful animal, and they coexist nicely. Indeed, they form an <i>ecosystem</i> in which all animals require other, much different animals to exist.<p>And it's insane to regard the tiger and the parrot and the snail as ""outliers"". Sure, they're unique, just as snowflakes are unique. But, in fact, there are a lot of different kinds of cats and birds and mollusks, not just these three. Indeed, there are creatures that employ some cat strategies and some bird strategies (lions: be a sharp-eyed predator with claws, but live in communal packs). The only way to argue that tigers and parrots and snails are ""outliers"" is to ignore the existence of all the other creatures in the world, the ones that bridge the gaps in animal-design space and that ultimately relate every known animal to every other known animal.<p>So, yes, it's insane to try to follow all the advice on the Internet simultaneously. But that doesn't mean it's insane to listen to 37signals advice, or Godin's advice, or some other company's advice. You just have to figure out which part of the animal kingdom you're in, and seek out the best practices which apply to creatures like <i>you</i>.

Their practices are often used as examples by the anti-religious left because of their untempered boldness in opposition to some results of science. However, they do not represent the whole of religious experience, and they could not, given that the scientific advances of the last thousand years have coincided with a deeply religious world. And, it should be noted that the scientific knowledge of the rural poor is probably below average anyway, before taking religion into account.<p>I'm actually impressed at the reasonableness of the discussion so far on this thread. Geeks often bristle at the mention of religion, largely due to the anti-intellectualism mongered by some of those rural protestant sects. The last time there was a thread on an article mentioning religion, the discussion quickly turned hostile and the article was deaded. This time, things went better due to the early appearance of reasonable and calm voices.

It's not really a proper analogy as there is a healthier way to have sex (even if you think it is immoral) and it's hard to find a healthy way to commit suicide as it involves the termination of your health.<p>However, if they do commit suicide, and they proposed that they wanted to do it by blowing themselves up on a schoolbus; or doing it peacefully alone at their house; I'd be much more against the schoolbus example as it takes other lives with it (and thus is less healthy to society). I'd say I think suicide is a terrible thing, do everything I could to help or convince them otherwise, but ultimately if someone really wants to kill themselves they can and will. I'd advise them that if they are going to do it, they should hurt as little people in the process as possible. I think not telling them that suicide bombing is worse than suicide alone in your home would be rather immoral. As much as I need to convince them not to commit suicide, I need to convince them almost more they shouldn't commit suicide and in the process kill other people.<p>To make the analogy fit a bit better we are going to assume that the person having sex and the person who wants to commit suicide aren't suffering from some psychological disorder (which puts both situations on a bit different grounds).<p>Also remember having sex with condoms is equivalent of trying to commit suicide with a gun that has a very very very low percentage of killing you (I'd argue driving your car to work has a much higher percentage of killing you, than having safe sex, where you and your partners are responsible and get tested regularly for STD's) and sex brings with it pleasurable benefits that suicide does not.<p>So in review, poor analogy.",1233938182

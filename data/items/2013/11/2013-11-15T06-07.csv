A potential short term solution would be to allow me to lock my phone with a pin and still have this work.<p>A lot of merchants want to see the physical card when making payment.

That leads two results. 1) You can miss if your cacheline size is less than python object size. 2) You miss if your python object is not alligned at the cacheline and comparison is with the part that is in the next cacheline side.<p>If these two condition apply then there is limit of 2 on speed up and increasing python object size reduces the effect of prefetch which still helps.<p>Another about prefetch distance I&#x27;d pick 5 based on his testing data. 
1) It has no downside on current tests.
2) Due to prefetch constant size any prefetch that hurts because you pick distance of 5 instead of 3 is unlikely to have any meaningfull effect at any prefetch distance.
3) It allows some improvement in comparison speed. Like if there where JIT on python side to specialize the test.
4) It allows a nice factor of improvement on CORE execution speed relative to memory latency.

6738076,comment,6732182,6737813,7,0,elohesra,,,"I honestly don&#x27;t even know what to say to sexist drivel like this. Since several replies to the parent have gone along the same lines of making overly generalizing misandric statements that would be rightly called out as sexist gibberish if said about women, I suppose I&#x27;ll just reply to this most egregious of the lot:<p>Where have all the smart hackers gone who&#x27;re so quick to point out that society is at fault when negative characters of overly-stereotyped women are raised? If I were to play their role -- and tacitly accept this farcical charade that men are all bluster and ego -- I&#x27;d point out that the reason that some men might be less inclined than some women to admit they don&#x27;t know the answer to something is that they know that they&#x27;ll be held accountable for not knowing that thing. In this stereotyped version of reality over which we all seem to be forming a merry echo-chamber, women are unlikely to be brutally admonished for being wrong or incompetent (perhaps because those around them expect no better of them, due to negative stereotypes). This gives them the freedom to admit they&#x27;re wrong, or that they don&#x27;t know a given thing. Men, on the other hand, will be held accountable for their lack of knowledge, making it a much riskier endeavour to admit they don&#x27;t know something.<p>Of course, this entire commentary presupposes that this phenomenon even exists. My team (half male, half female), shows this &#x27;desire to be seen as knowledgeable&#x27; as a corollary of age and gender combined: the oldest member of the team never says &#x27;could you explain that to me&#x27;, and always attempts to BS his way through conversations, but the younger 20-something aged male members of the team are perfectly happy to admit it when they&#x27;re out of their depth.

Another article released by a local news outlet two days later [2] stated that he was sought for questioning but not charged with any crime.<p>As for the other guy, he wasn&#x27;t convicted of writing a book on fooling the polygraph.  According to the prosecuting attorney [3], he was travelling around the US giving one-on-one advice to clients who wanted to pass the polygraph for $1-2k plus travel expenses each, receiving specific details about each case, instructed them to lie and provided instruction on exactly how to conceal those details.  I think in this case the feds definitely have reasonable suspicion to believe that his clients are guilty of perjury or falsifying testimony in order to gain employment with the federal government, and they had enough evidence to show that he knowingly aided them.

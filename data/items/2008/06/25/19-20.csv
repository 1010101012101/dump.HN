The fact that I might be tempted to break a rule doesn't mean I'm morally obliged to shed tears for those who break it and get burned.  The folks who were most hurt here were the investors, who clearly bought into the scam not realizing the risks involved.   So if any tears are shed it should be for them.<p>But what really irked me about the article was the pseudo-nationalist tone.  ""Who cares if they were parasites?

227863,comment,227750,227750,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"I love this question and hope somebody has some useful information or at least that you post your experience once the issue has played out. This is a very common scenario, rookie founders of small companies getting approached for acquisition, but there simply is not enough info on the sell side. The buyers know a ton and you have no info.<p>We were approached early on and I asked everyone I knew for advice (founders, corp dev friends, former EIRs) and nobody had anything concrete, especially about the part which was most important to me: how do I value and sell the company.<p>Another hard part for me was determining if I wanted to sell. What I really needed was for them to give me a price so I could think about it. What I ended up doing was having the meeting and telling them both that I wasn't sure and that all my friends in the company had told me not to work there. What I figured was best case they'd give me a hard sell and worst case the conversation would end. I ended up with the worst case.<p>What people have told me afterward was that taking $1M at this age is a golden opportunity since you'll have a lifetime of ideas so you should go into this meeting selling. Tell them how big of an opportunity you open up for their business.<p>As for value, this is what I've heard. As a baseline start with $1M per employee (so for you $2M) and then let that number vary wildly. If you are essentially broke and they're bailing you out you might expect as little as $200k. If you're a high flyer you might expect as much as $10M.",1214423646

Yes there are horror stories of underrepresented entrepreneurs getting screwed, but what gets mentioned less is the opposite situation that tptacek alludes to, where deals are killed because too much control is given over to the lawyers, and the forest is lost to obsessive focus on the trees. As nice as it would be to turn over control and wash your hands of all legal decision-making, lawyers must be managed, just like any other employee or contractor. It can be intimidating for young entrepreneurs to override the recommendations of older, more experienced attorneys, but that is exactly what is sometime required to make deals like this go through.<p>As has been mentioned on this forum many times, there are plenty of law firms (in the Bay Area at least) who have emerging business practices that will defer your fees until an acquisition or an investment event occurs.",1214423191

Some of the things you should know about off the top of my head (to get a sense whether you are reading the right things or to help you search for stuff): earn-outs, holdbacks, escrow, non-competes, indemnification, capital gains taxes, stock vs asset transactions, arbitration clauses.<p>That being said, there are numerous ways to value a company, e.g. multiples of revenue, users/customers, traffic, assets, etc.  What makes sense is very case-by-case and industry specific. But what it comes down to is that valuation is just a tool to make a case for deal terms.  In the end, a deal is an agreement between two parties about what the terms of the deal are worth to them.<p>They probably already have an idea in mind about the minimum they will pay, and they are probably trying to draw an initial # out of you.  I'm not going to tell you how to negotiate, but just be very wary of this, i.e. throwing out an initial #.  It can set the stage for the whole transaction, and since you obviously don't already have a well thought out valuation, you may come to regret whatever you throw out.<p>Whether to work for them or not and how that would look like, is again, very case by case.  For example, it could be structured in a way where if certain targets are met you get more money (earn-outs), or it could be a short transition consulting contract, or simply a salaried position not otherwise tied to the deal.  I personally would make sure whatever you get up front can not be influenced by your behavior as an employee, i.e. are completely independent.",1214422638

227811,story,,,4,8,amrithk,"Advice on partnership issues.....",,"Hi, \nA few months ago, 2 of my friends and I came up with an idea to create a website that would allow people to create and share polls, and analyze the results in various interesting ways. We did not know anything about web programming or databases but spent time trying to learn about it. Our aim was to build a quick ""proof-of-concept"" prototype without intially caring much about the UI/Design.<p>I knew someone from college who was a good hacker and asked him to join us. I felt he could help us with the technical issues, teach us how to architect the website and point us to the right tools we could use. He also needed housing for a few months and we thought he could stay and work with us. We pitched him about the idea and he seemed enthusiastic. To prevent disagreements in future, all 4 of us signed an agreement which clearly stated how much equity each person would get.<p>Things seemed to go well for a few months. We even managed to get a really basic prototype up and running. Then one night after dinner, the good hacker told us he would gradually step away from helping out. He wanted to focus on his day job and he told us that he had been helping us all along only because we provided him with free housing. Furthermore, he wasn't yet ready to make a major commitment to what we were working on. We were pretty upset but there was nothing we could do to get him to stay. He found housing soon afterwards and moved out.<p>We haven't been in touch with him for a while. Since he moved out, we have been persisting with our idea on weekends (all of us have 14-15 hour work-days at our day jobs). We are more experienced and have learnt a lot, particularly through places like HN.<p>One of our team-members just quit his job to work on this full-time. We are hoping to release a new version of our site (with a good UI and a more fully developed concept) by the end of September and apply to programs like YC in the fall.<p>Our only concern is, how can we draft a new agreement that voids the previous paternership agreement that we signed with the good hacker? We think it is only right that we compensate the good hacker for working with us and teaching us about things like good program design etc. However, given how he chose to drop out of the project in a sudden manner, we feel that he certainly doesn't deserve 10% of the initial equity. What do you suggest we do?<p>I was thinking of arranging a meeting with him over dinner and welcoming back, telling him that we would love to have him as a ""technical"" advisor"". He wouldn't have to devote a significant amount of time to the project and we would still get the benefit of having someone experienced look at our code, suggest better ways of designing the application, and recommend new tools that might be useful for our development process. Is this a good idea?<p>Apologies if this is a long post. Just wanted to get the whole story out there so I could hear some good suggestions.<p>Thanks,",1214420735

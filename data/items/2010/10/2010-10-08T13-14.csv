The ISO is basically an independent sales rep for a Merchant Services Provider (MSP) associated with a bank.  When your account is set up, the funds from your customer pass seamlessly through the MSP's bank and are deposited into your local bank account.<p>The ISO makes his/her money through fees on your account.  The more sales you have, the more they earn.<p>Competition between ISOs is intense, so it pays to shop around.  Every local bank I've dealt with ""outsources"" their merchant accounts to an ISO.  I assume the bank receives referal income from the ISO, as the fees we've been quoted for a merchant account through a local bank have always been higher than we've found elsewhere.<p>A few months ago, we quit having our own merchant account and moved to PayPal, as basic interchange fees have increased to the point where we found that is the least expensive option for our level of sales (>$10,000/month).<p>We use a basic PayPal Website Payments Standard Account using their name-value pair (NVP) interface.  Our customers enter their shipping address data on our web site and their credit card information on PayPal's web site so we don't have to worry about PCI compliance.  We use custom headers on our order page (""Checkout: Step 1"") and our PayPal page (""Checkout: Step 2"") to make it look pretty seamless.  You can upgrade to a Website Payments Pro account for $20/month if you want to do it all on your own server, however.",1286545762

1771610,comment,1771428,1771428,0,0,edw519,,,"Nice rant, but too bad that OP probably hasn't heard some of the more reasonable counter-arguments and understood their logic.  Just a few ""enterprise axioms"":<p><pre><code>  - Stuff must work consistently, regardless of who works there.
  - All data and programs must satisfy corporate audit requirements.
  - All data and programs must be backed up and restorable.
  - All technology must be supported, no matter what.
</code></pre>
I've seen all kinds of creative solutions to enterprise problems that didn't satisfy these axioms.  And you know what happens?  Something goes wrong and no one knows what to do.<p>That server under Joe's desk with those cool spreadsheets just crashed and no one ever backed it up.  The nifty little Ruby app that Sue put together; she's gone and no one else knows Ruby.  The open source web server just crashed and no one is to blame because there is no vendor to blame.  The nine new kinds of smart phones that different sales guys like but no one knows how to support.<p>It goes on and on.  Creative people get creative.  Cool solutions help.  Until they don't help anymore.  Because the costs suddenly outweigh the benefits.<p>And one more dirty little enterprise secret than many creative people overlook: you can solve most problems with many different tools.  Sure the old tools may not be as fun, but they can still get the job done at a lower cost.<p>In an ideal world, we'd get to work will cool stuff AND help the enterprise at the same time.  But if the trade-off is our intellectual gratification vs. the enterprise's profits, the enterprise will win every time; count on it.",1286545712

They add a lot of social submit widgets that use non-async scripts.<p>If you see a substring <script src=""http:// or <script src=""https:// in your HTML source - you are killing your site slowly.<p>Using Twitter's official ReTweet button? You've slowed your site down by 60 seconds per each page (I don't know how many people are affected by this hiccup that lasts more than 5 days now for me, but you can easily fix it for everybody, see below)<p>Just to be clear. I'm on 35Mbps line in Russia near Moscow (4.3MBytes/s - very fast! 4ms ping to national traffic exchange point in Russia).<p>Yet some sites load up to 2-5 minutes for me? Why?<p>According to Chrome Dev Tools I receive main blog content, including all images within 1-2 seconds. (It's a 35Mbps!), but I don't see anything from your site on screen (even though it has finished loading), because...<p>""platform.twitter.com"" responds in 49-62 seconds! Uses <script src=""http://... for their ""retweet"" button. Your site is STUCK until ""platform.twitter.com"" loads (1 minute).<p>Facebook's CDN responds within 30-50 seconds. The site doesn't load until it's loaded.<p>""www.stumbleupon.com""'s button loads in 20 seconds.<p>I'm not sure what the problem is, but I can tell you for sure - it takes minutes to load some sites with those buttons, it takes less than a blink after I add ""127.0.0.1 platform.twitter.com"" and others to /etc/hosts (that's not a way to solve it, it's a way to diagnose the problem, see below for solution).<p>Many of you use a lot of those buttons in hope that they will bring you visitors. But while they load - they lose you visitors that have to wait 2 minutes for your page to load.<p>WordPress' social submit plugins are often have the same effect on your site.<p>The solution? Use async code and ask your plugin developer to move to async code.<p>It's not some futuristic HTML5 goodie that works only in modern browsers. It works everywhere.<p>Facebook has async code - use it! 
Google Analytics has async - use it!<p>Twitter doesn't give out async, but it's easy to do it, based on FaceBook and Google Analytics code:<p><pre><code>  <a href=""http://twitter.com/share"" 
  class=""twitter-share-button"" data-count=""horizontal"" 
  data-via=""WhitePostsCom"">Tweet</a> 
  
  <script> 
    (function() {
    var src = document.createElement('script'); 
    src.async = true;
    src.src = document.location.protocol + '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(src);
    }());                        
  </script> 
</code></pre>
Replace the first part with your own code instead of WhitePostsCom one.<p>StatCounter doesn't give async, adapt it from the code StatCounter gives you: 
(There was a day when StatCounter didn't load in 2 minutes! Your site is stuck again if you don't do async)<p><pre><code>  <!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->

  var sc_invisible=[YOUR CODE HERE]; 
  var sc_security=""[YOUR CODE HERE]""; 
  (function() {
      var ga = document.createElement('script'); 
      ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
      ga.src = document.location.protocol + '//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js';
      var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; 
      s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);

  <!-- End of StatCounter Code -->
</code></pre>
StumbleUpon? Adapt it from the above codes.<p>Seeing someone asking you to insert '<script src=""http://' into your code? Tell them to do better engineering and stop slowing down your site.<p>P.S. The reasons for hiccups of Twitter and FB's CDN might be poor peering, bad servers, anything really. You can't fix Twitter's and Facebook's software and servers, but you can let your visitors see your site without depending on how good do engineers at those companies do their job.<p>P.P.S. There is a good question in comments about how to diagnose your own site's problems: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1771755<p>Problematic hosts list (the srcs that cause sometimes huge slowdowns for me) - just in case you need it:<p><pre><code>  widgets.digg.com

I think you guys, by now, have enough information about users and checkins to create algorithms that can determine ""hot"" checkins vs. ""cold"" checkins as and when they come in. Because not every user is the same, a more user-centric view can definitely help you come up with a more scalable (or graciously failing) system. For example, I don't checkin as much as some of my friends who checkin 10-15 times a day. So, there is no point in giving my checkins as much priority as those busy folks.",1286543814

Is it a real XML parser[1] or can it only handle a ""simple"" subset of XML? I am surprised that more people don't seem to share the same skepticism as you and me. Probably because most people don't realize that implementing a conforming XML 1.0 parser is not a trivial task.<p>And you are right about the XML data binding tools. In most cases parsing XML itself is not what takes the bulk of the time. It is validation (against DTD, XML Schema, or ad-hoc), data conversion (e.g., from ""123"" string to 123 integer) and perhaps construction of some in-memory representation (with memory allocations that it involves) that take the bulk of the time. There are existing tools[2] that can performs the above tasks an order of magnitude faster than a general-purpose XML parsers by generating the tailor-made validation and data extraction code as well as data structures from XML Schema.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.codesynthesis.com/~boris/blog/2008/05/19/real-xml-parser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codesynthesis.com/~boris/blog/2008/05/19/real-xml...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsde/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsde/</a>",1286543645

5557377,comment,5557077,5557077,6,0,rlpb,,,"""And even when they are salted and hashed it's worth asking (or wondering) whether they used a scheme that could beat Carla's computer equivalent by hashing multiple times.""<p>Using such a scheme is generally called using a ""key derivation function"". Commonly known ones are PBKDF2, bcrypt and scrypt.<p>What worries me is that most competent people in the industry still ask whether passwords were salted and hashed, rather than whether they used a key derivation function.<p>This suggests to me that even generally competent developers are not aware that salting and hashing on its own is considered weak. PBKDF2 is over a decade old now!<p>If you want to educate people, please finish by suggesting that developers should not be rolling their own, but instead using a key derivation function that wraps the knowledge of the state of the art so that developers don't have to worry about the details any more.<p>""Be on the look out when a password database is reported to stolen to see if the press reports that the passwords were 'salted' and 'hashed'...""<p>Instead, I would be on the look out to make a note of which key derivation function they were using.

5557352,comment,5557209,5557209,4,0,tgflynn,,,"I doubt regulation plays more than a marginal role here.<p>The truth is that capitalism is not good at creating new technologies, only at increasing adoption of technologies that have already been developed.<p>Innovation on big problems is hard by definition.  It takes  decades and there is a very high risk of failure.  The original ideas may not work out, an alternative technology may be developed which ends up dominating the market or increasingly the way may be blocked by patents.<p>Why would an investor support such an undertaking, especially when very good returns can be obtained in well established areas like social networking (at least if you spread around your investments) and finance ?<p>The only exceptions to this general picture are those very rare companies with practical monopoly power which have been able to fund developments of this nature.  Examples are Google and pre-deregulation AT&T.  But such behemoths represent only a small fraction of the total economy and though some monopolies might be good for technology development it seems unlikely that increasing their role in the economy would be of general benefit.  The result is that the vast majority of new technologies over the past 60 years have been spearheaded by government research (semiconductors, the internet, etc.).  Even self-driving cars were made possible by government driven efforts.<p>Overall I think society vastly underfunds research and development compared to what would be optimal for mid to long-term enhancement of human well-being and this is primarily due to a broken socio-economic system.",1366109496

We waited over two hours for our turn along with everyone else, just to get a stamp. The agent then thought my wife's picture wasn't perfect so they detained us to verify her identity. We were were subjected to stupid and unnecessary abusive questioning until they realized they were obviously wrong and let us go. So 3+ hours of nonsense and they let us go.<p>I realize that most people don't have to go through detention, but how can adding ~2 hours unnecessarily after (typically long and difficult) international travel be a good idea?  It's a self-defeating waste. Investment in speeding up the process would no-doubt be returned to the economy and in better-will.",1366109486

Lying is a huge problem, 81% of all online dating users will lie about some aspect of themselves.<p>I wrote this comment before I made it to the end of what you wrote about LinkedIn endorsements. The implementation is still up for debate, but the idea is compelling at the very least. I do think that LinkedIn endorsements are worthless because I haven't yet used them, but that idea distills a person down to their core.

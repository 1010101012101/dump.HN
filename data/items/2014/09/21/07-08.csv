8346623,comment,8344966,8346110,3,0,lispm,,,"> &quot;The curse of Lisp&quot; is a well known phrase that&#x27;s been used in hundreds of essays:<p>If you actually look through the Google results, there are not that many &#x27;essays&#x27; about that topic.<p>> There has been much debate about why Lisp has not taken over the world of computing. It was invented in 1958, it was taught in all the best schools, yet it has not gained mass traction.<p>This fate is shared by a lot of things.<p>The whole idea that Lisp needs or will get &#x27;mass traction&#x27; is just complete bullshit. There is no reason for that expectation.<p>>  Your statement &quot;it is not limited to Lisp&quot; is simply ignorant.<p>No, it isn&#x27;t. The whole idea is just unscientific bullshit.<p>> There is something special about Lisp: no other language has received so much praise and so little use.<p>So, what. Lisp exists since 1958. During the last 50+ years people have written a lot about Lisp. That&#x27;s it. There are now many times more articles published in the past year about Java and its ecosystem than over Lisp during its whole lifetime.<p>>  Essays like the Bipolar Lisp Programmer are important contributions toward understanding what the problem is.<p>Tarver has very little idea what he is talking about. He lives in his own world. Everybody at an university has seen similar behavior in different contexts. But I would not call it &#x27;bipolar&#x27;, because this is just a bullshit label, failing to describe anything credible.<p>Lisp got used in a lot of innovative projects often in a R&D and University context. As a rapid prototyping tool, as a research vehicle, ... That their &#x27;products&#x27; are not polished and tend to fail, is just normal. Innovation fails a lot. Also Lisp was often a prototyping tool. Prototypes tend to be reworked into products using a different technology. Just like somebody makes a prototype using a high-end CNC machine and later uses different production technologies for mass production. It also attracts people, who are innovative. It&#x27;s just like startups, which fail a lot.<p>That&#x27;s just it. Move on nothing to see.",1411286367
8346622,comment,8346240,8346514,1,0,DanBC,,,"> \nGovernment-negotiated rates places the pricing totally outside the realm of necessity or reality and makes it a purely political matter, and politics is a messy, fickle thing built on personal favors and tit-for-tat. Not having your political activity interpreted as corruption or bribery mostly depends on not pissing off someone with more power than you.<p>You might want to read how England does it.  A national organisation (NICE) gives guidance about what care pathways and treatment should look like.  Local CCGs (clinical commissioning groups) decide what they&#x27;re goong to pay for.<p>Your description isn&#x27;t even close to reality in England.",1411286337

These have also been around for a long time, even though it costs the magazine &quot;barely anything&quot; to acquire a bunch of SEO dreck and put it on the shelves as well.<p>Planet Python aggregates blogs from people who mostly talk about Python. The selection is hand-picked, which makes it another curated experience - even though it could aggregate many more blogs for &quot;barely anything.&quot;<p>I picked TJ&#x27;s for a reason - where most grocery stores might have 5-10 brands for a given product, TJ&#x27;s might have 1-3, and likely a store brand. This works because they do more curatation work to find something close to the Pareto frontier. I believe some people go to TJ precisely because it limits the effect of the paradox of choice. This also means customers switch from item brand loyalty to store brand loyalty, which is &quot;bad&quot; for producers of nationwide brands, but &quot;good&quot; for TJ and presumably its customers.<p>MCRed in this thread makes the brilliant observation that Google&#x27;s GMail curates the email experience by removing spam - even though it costs &quot;barely anything&quot; for them to include the spam in the main mailbox.

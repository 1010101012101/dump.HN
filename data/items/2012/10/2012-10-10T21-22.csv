They generally focus on rote mechanics at a slow pace with very little to keep the interest of anyone and this is a big reason people (a) think they are bad at maths and (b) hate maths.<p>My elementary school barely advanced beyond arithmetic but, thanks in large part to programming, I independently advanced much faster than that.  I still regret not pushing myself to go further but at least I got to spend most of my K-12 education ahead of the mathematics track.<p>I have no idea where you are in mathematics since ""elementary school"" is very broad, but BetterExplained (<a href=""http://betterexplained.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/</a>) is a great place to get some started.  It can even give you a better grasp of addition and subtraction, let alone more advanced topics.",1349906336

You wouldn't be able to tell one patch of sand from another. So he just picked a random 200x200px square of sand.<p>Using this sample of sand, he analyzed the color distribution. Looking at it, he decided the color of a given pixel of sand-sample can be modelled reasonably well by assuming a random gaussian distribution (think bell curve).<p>Next, he assumed the <i>whole picture</i> was sand. The black-and-white image at the end is essentially a plot of the likelihood that the corresponding picture in the original picture would have been a grain of sand, assuming the normal distribution found earlier. Black means ""very likely"" and white means ""not so likely"".<p>Since we argued earlier that any patch of sand in this picture is as good as any other, all of the sand appears black. The rover, and crucially, the foreign object, do not fit the modelled distribution, so they stand out in stark contrast.",1349906333

I want them to pay less than that, so they get something out of the deal.

If an Uber driver operates unsafely, the driver and Uber simply sever the relationship, and the driver goes somewhere else.<p>I'm not sure I buy the story about being pulled over for a suspended license, for a bunch of reasons:<p>* Over the last 10 years, I've driven more on suspended licenses than valid ones (I'm a very safe driver but I suck at getting my plate sticker updated and suck even worse at actually paying the resulting tickets). I've never been pulled over for having a suspended license, or even heard of someone being pulled over for that.<p>* The police in Illinois and, I assume, most other states have strict rules about when they can pull people over (the ""primary"" and ""secondary"" offenses). If your car is compliant and you aren't committing a moving violation and you're wearing your seatbelt, what grounds does an officer have to pull you over? Consider that cars are often driven by people other than their owners.<p>* There are too many valid reasons you can be pulled over. Tail light out. Sticker's a month out of date. Improper lane change. ""Not wearing seat belt"".<p>Are you sure you're not confusing ""suspended license"" with ""suspended tags""? Driving on suspended <i>tags</i> will get you pulled over quickly. Illinois will suspend your plates for things like toll violations.<p>I stand by my assertion: if you're a good driver, and your car is compliant, you're probably pretty safe driving on a suspended license. There is a pretty low probability of getting a relatively stiff ticket, and that's about it. Make sure your plates are good.<p> <i>I get pulled over, mind you.

Whenever a query or an update addresses an ordinary view's virtual table, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying base tables. A materialized view takes a different approach in which the query result is cached as a concrete table that may be updated from the original base tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of some data being potentially out-of-date. It is most useful in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent queries of the actual base tables can be extremely expensive.""",1349904439

The fundamental difference about Uber (that I think is implicit to proponents but gets lost in the actual discussion), is that you're using a well-known public-facing party to request the service in the first place. This has wide ranging benefits for consumer protection (not that it solves everything, but most taxi regulations exist because you've traditionally had to trust the first guy that drives by in a yellow car, or an informally run dispatch station). Specifically in relation to your point, Uber has a strong incentive to make sure drivers are licensed (and if not, their business insurance sure does).<p>2. Maybe two years ago, I was in the car when my friend got pulled over for driving ""without"" a license (MA RMV SOP is to suspend licenses without notifying). He passed a clearly visible state trooper (going under speed limit, ofc) stopped two lanes over. Five miles later, he's being pulled over because the trooper had run his plate and saw that the vehicle was owned by someone with a suspended license. Whether it's technology or simply an overabundance of cops, those quaint days of enforcement directed only at drivers that stick out are pretty much over.",1349903505

Getting Things Done would be a good thing to research.<p>Here's an example. This Saturday I've got to wrap up a side project. I'm planning on making Saturday a ""heavy burn"" day, I've got a TON to do.<p>Saturday morning, from 7:30am - 8:00am I start planning (aka todo list). For the first half hour I'm going to casually wake up, sip coffee and write down everything I want to accomplish IN THAT DAY. It is going to look something like this:<p><pre><code>      *  Complete Add/Remove Users
      *  Create permissions system
      *  Create groups-in-groups
      *  Complete external log-in
      *  Dinner w/wife
      *  Park w/daughter
      *  Read Robopocalypse, have beer, alone time
      *  Play with sprite map for game (fun-side-project)
      *  Final payment to credit card
      *  Call company about tree triming prices
      *  Talk to Frank about UI changes
      *  Call parents about Thanksgiving
      *  Dog needs to be walked
</code></pre>
This todo list is useless after Saturday. It includes some things that are part of my larger goals (spending more time by myself without a computer and reading), some high priority items (do work) and some misc things that I know will probably interrupt my day (thanksgiving plans, dog walking). It also has rewards (Dinner w/wife and Park w/daughter). The end result is to shift this around so that I can spend more time doing the four things I WANT to do that day (park, dinner, dog, book) and as little time doing the rest.<p>So the first thing I'm probably going to do is re-organize this list and from 8:00-8:30 take care of all the 'under 15 minute tasks'<p><pre><code>      *  Final payment to credit card
      *  Call company about tree triming prices
      *  Talk to Frank about UI changes
      *  Call parents about Thanksgiving
</code></pre>
Boom. Now all my possible interruptions or 'things in the back of my mind' are done.  Now I can lump together the big things.<p>First I do these three (from 9am-2pm)<p><pre><code>      *  Complete Add/Remove Users
      *  Create permissions system
      *  Create groups-in-groups
</code></pre>
Then I get to do these<p><pre><code>      *  Park w/daughter
      *  Dog needs to be walked
</code></pre>
Wohoo! I just gave myself a goal to reach by 2pm. After that I get this<p><pre><code>      *  Complete external log-in
      *  Read Robopocalypse, have beer, alone time
      *  Dinner w/wife
</code></pre>
And later that evening if I still feel up to it this<p><pre><code>      *  Play with sprite map for game (fun-side-project)
</code></pre>
Would I do this every day? No. However this is a great way for me to maximise the days that I plan to do a ton of work while still not feeling burnt out. It means I can say by Saturday evening that I 'spent time with my wife, daughter, dog' AND 'read a book by myself' AND 'got a shit-ton of work done'.<p>Of course. YMMV. I don't see the need to turn todo lists into a Tabs VS Spaces debate where one side is clearly in the wrong. That's what I feel Atwood is doing, and I don't agree with it.",1349903424

I disagree with the characterization of the WinUI version of IE being the ""mobile version of their browser"".

I haven't used Windows 8 much, but I did install the beta in a VM, and it booted to Metro (...er Windows UI). When I launched IE, it launched in WinUI, so it's reasonable to assume that mom & pop are going to use IE10 in WinUI at least as much as they do ""desktop"" mode.<p>The whole kerfuffle here centers around the ambiguity of the terms in use. It is unfair to take the blog author to task over his language, only to use unclear language in return.

Add to that the fact that my boss has pointedly told the team that he hates the 'mercenary' types around SV who are only in it for the money...",1349902912

I've been a home owner for a good 10 years now, we moved a couple of years ago into a new neighbor hood.<p>Most of hte homes are very nice and well kept up, but the ones that are the most in need of repair are the rentals.  And subsequently the houses beside them take a hit in property value.<p>We know most of the renters and they are nice hard working people who do the upkeep( cut grass, weed flower beds, etc), but the large repair items are always left undone.<p>the painting, shingling, gutter cleaning, etc.  And it makes sense for both parties not to do it.  The renters don't care  and the home owners don't care about their property values until they sell.<p>Sadly though having renters in a neighborhood brings down property values.  I'm pretty certain that having a high concentration of AirBnB renters would bring down values even more.<p>So there is harm done, a fair bit of it.",1349902860

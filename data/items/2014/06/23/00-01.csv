I&#x27;ve been working in online advertising for 10 odd years and have seen advertising working and not.<p>This Ebay example was great showing both sides; bidding for their brand term was a waste of money as they are a brand leader not in a defensive strategy. Finding new customers was profitable. It seems they let the former get out of hand and dominate their spend mix.<p>I see similar situations of excessive wasted spend all the time as companies target the wrong metrics (note: there always is some). Until this study I would bet my house the PPC team at eBay were being largely judged by &#x27;CPA&#x27; type metrics. Every year they would have tighter goals in a market that is getting more competitive so they go for cheap wins that look good on paper i.e.grab customers already coming in as you know they will convert. I see this at almost every company.<p>Profitable advertising absolutely does exist but like anything, you need smart people running the program and you can&#x27;t surround them with targets that make them go for the wins that look good in the short-term reports. As much as we monitor more advertising remains part art, part science. And I say that as a guy that likes his data more than most.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re being told ads only work for other people you&#x27;re talking to the wrong people. I love my marketing and what it can do for a company when run well. If you have any questions I&#x27;ll happily talk your ear off.",1403484756

7929668,comment,7928206,7928824,3,0,ArikBe,,,"I have two comments with respect to what you wrote:<p>FWIW I&#x27;m an undergrad who is currently writing his thesis (empirical economics). I use the German Socio Economic Panel data set, which is a representative survey of ~11,000 German households (totaling about 79,000 individuals over 28 years). The reason why I picked a data set instead of collecting my own data is <i>precisely</i> to avoid the situation of the social sciences student you describe. As an undergrad, getting data is extremely difficult. You usually get about 6 weeks to write your thesis and you have absolutely no training in data collection and/or survey design. Getting data from students is your best bet, but nobody wants to answer your questionnaire because…hold your breath…<i>everyone</i> is sending out questionnaires. I get spammed with these things. Luckily, nobody has asked me to pretend that I am a 13 year old. So quite frankly most students panic after about 2-3 weeks and they will try to do anything to get out the situation. The alternative is not graduating and paying tuition for another year.<p>Secondly: Undergrad thesis =\\= scientific paper. The fraction of undergrads who end up being social scientists is…tiny. Out of 300-400 econ students who graduate at my uni every year, I think 20 or less will go onto grad school (I&#x27;m proxying the number by thinking about how many went to do an MPhil). Now econ grad school is a different beast. Essentially you either end up doing experimental research or you work with observational data (assuming you are not a theoretician, those exist too; Economics is pretty much applied mathematics at that level.). Experiments can be checked and working with observational data requires a trove of econometrics. Trying to fool a panel of econometricians isn&#x27;t easy, especially when these days you have to send in your data to the journal (or so my supervisor says; he has a paper forthcoming in the Quarterly Journal of Economics).<p>Social science in general is becoming more and more computational and statistically rigorous. Gone are the days when an &quot;expert&quot; would find a correlation between two variables and then speculate which way the causality flows…if any.",1403483984

(hahaha)<p>One good trick is to take charge of the interview.<p>There are standard questions the interviewer must ask (every time he does an interview) Try to answer all of those before he gets to ask them. This renders him without things to say. Then you get to ask your own questions.<p>Change the discussion from &quot;why do we want to hire you?&quot; into &quot;why do I want to be hired by you?&quot; When will I get a raise? when will I get promotion? when will you get to sit where he is sitting? And where will he be at that point? How are ideas treated here? Is one supposes to show initiative or not?<p>Will you get locked away in an office or will there be other people on the floor? Who do you get to work with? Have him tell me something about your future coworkers.<p>My favorite one is to just bluntly ask why their product is better than the competitor. I ask that because when it is asked from me I want to be able to answer it precisely the way I&#x27;m suppose to.<p>Show an interest in the interviews, the guy is doing that all day long, is he having fun? Did he see many good candidates? How many interviews will they do for a single job opening? Does he enjoy his work? Don&#x27;t allow him to just sit there pretending to be interested in your life. Show an interest in who he is, what he does and where he comes from (or she)<p>You can be empathic about it but working down your list like a robot is equally impressive.<p>Talk fast but not to fast, keep eye contact but don&#x27;t gaze.<p>If their argument &#x27;why you want to work there&#x27; is good enough and their product is good enough end the interview before he does, ask if he made up his mind already, when do I start?

We had been vacationing there for years and I have something of a love affair with the Ocean. It inspires me, I feel alive, free and in touch with the Earth and my place in it when I&#x27;m close to it. I really want to pass this gift of closeness to my children. At the same time as we were packing to move two of my most respected friends asked me to join their startup as a partner. I had serious reservations about moving 1000 miles away with a young family and being a partner in a startup but my drive and ambition got the best of me. They needed someone who understood mobile applications and could build both Android and iOS while shaping the data/app to really focus on a mobile platform&#x27;s strong points. I was deeply honored that they asked me to be that guy. \nSo I accepted, and worked like crazy to make a Christmas launch. It was September when I moved to Maine. I worked 45-50 hours a day at my day job and 40-50 at the startup. All of this closeness and betterment of our live that my wife and I dreamed of moving to Maine? It didn&#x27;t happen for me, I had responsibilities to take care of. All the things that need to be done as part of a move, my wife handled. Spending time with my kids, I&#x27;d make time for that after the launch. I hit my date (barely and not nearly as well as I would have liked) for iOS, but I couldn&#x27;t take it any more. I&#x27;m tough and I HATE to back down so I pushed on, for three more months. I pushed so hard that I passed out twice from exhaustion. Android was up next and I sat everyone involved down and said exactly that. That I cared about them and felt like I was letting them down but I have to change my live because it wasn&#x27;t worth it any more. We talked and talked it around. I took my equity earned and made myself available for questions and help on the existing apps. Today I just got back from the beach and my wife, kids and I have never been happier. I&#x27;m still great friends with my ex-partners and I wish them well. I had a lot of the same fears as you but the best decision I have ever made was to talk it over with my partners and to walk away. Good luck to you, my email is in my profile if you want someone to talk to.",1403483191

I think it&#x27;s interesting to control the market and see how many collective points can be achieved by all players.  Playing  all four players cooperatively, I choose plot installations based on maximizing the plot of land, not out of necessity.  I shared food and energy so all four players had some, every turn. Smithore was used to create mules, so I would grab mules, without installations, and drop them in the middle of no where to drive the price up.  I can remember in one turn with four players, I could drop a whole pen of 15 mules.  Naturally, since I owned all the Smithore and drove the price up, it payed well every turn.  Crystite, however, is tricky to figure.  I could never determine what drives the price fluctuations with Crystite.  Seemed to be random.<p>Best part of the game, is the auction view.  Cool UI.  Buyers on the bottom and seller on the top.  Moving up and down changes the price as the auction timer ticks away.  Every turn, there&#x27;s a lot of action in the auctions depending on the type of play going on, needs of the other players, and prices of the commodities being traded.<p>As +fidotron states, it is profoundly brilliant.

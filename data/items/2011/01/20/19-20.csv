2125043,comment,2124020,2124865,0,0,grellas,,,"I confess that it is editorializing but this was <i>really</i> bad for AT&T and the tenor of the argument was quite unusual.<p>The case involves the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which was passed decades ago and has mounds of decisions on the books interpreting its provisions. This is federal statute and the legal rules concerning statutes center on what the legislative body intended in enacting any given statute.  FOIA has 17 categories by which a party can be protected from disclosure, including one for ""personal privacy."" AT&T's <i>central argument</i> - the centerpiece upon which the lower appellate court decided the case in AT&T's favor and upon which AT&T's counsel was riding hard hoping to gain a victory in the Supreme Court - rested on the idea that Congress, in enacting FOIA, defined the word ""person"" to include corporations and, hence, when that same Congress, elsewhere in that same statute enacted at the same time, specified that there was a right of ""personal"" privacy, it must have intended ""personal"" to include every one listed in the statute as a ""person,"" i.e., corporations.<p>Basically, after the justices ripped AT&T's counsel apart, Chief Justice Roberts said, in effect, OK, if ""personal"" derives from ""person,"" let me see if I can think of other cases where an adjective links with its noun counterpart, then let's see, ""craft"" and ""crafty"", ""squirrel"" and ""squirrely"", ""pastor"" and ""pastoral"" and so on - of course, making it look absurd that anyone would argue that some common meaning was intended by Congress simply by the force of the linguistic connection between ""person"" and ""personal."" By all accounts, this salvo had a devastating effect, leaving AT&T's counsel stammering about how his client had other arguments upon which to rely beyond the ""grammatical imperative.""<p>On the merits, too, this is the same court that, in <i>Citizens United,</i> had found that the idea of corporate ""personhood"" should be recognized such as to give corporations free speech protections vis-a-vis attempts to limit their speech through campaign finance reform legislation. However (though this is not sufficiently appreciated by those who disdain the idea of corporate personhood), the idea of a corporation as a ""legal person"" dates back at least to Blackstone in the 1750s and is deeply rooted in the law (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1099625"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1099625</a>). <i>Legally</i>, it was not that big of a jump to say that the idea extended to protecting the speech of corporations under the First Amendment (of course, the case could have easily gone another way as well but this court had no problem with such a result). The FOIA case, though, is entirely different. Here, Congress enacted a statute with specific purposes and built in protections for ""personal privacy"" without any hint that this might apply in some nebulous way to corporations. When that statute is examined, it becomes very difficult to justify the idea that Congress would have intended any such result in using the phrase ""personal privacy"" and the court of appeal had reached that result primarily based on the flawed grammatical argument noted above. That is why the Roberts comments from the bench were so devastating.<p>The government's counsel, sensing a good thing, waived the last 10 minutes of time for rebuttal and was more than content to let the matter rest when his turn came. When a lawyer voluntarily decides to shut up, you know that something major has just happened!<p>All in all, a really bad day for AT&T's lawyers and for its case.",1295553355

They are tremendous products for people willing to pay a premium not to have to deal with the nuts and bolts and desiring to concentrate only on the task at hand.

Are there other examples of experts being so willing to accept that their tools are not customizable?  I think of things like low-fi music and the Holga, but even there there is a lot of modding going on.<p>The obvious answer is probably that 'hacker' is an applied rather than base characteristic.  Rather, one can be a software hacker without caring at all about the underlying hardware.

Long story short, I came across a book on Amazon called ""Zen Meditation and Wisdom for a Better Life: A Gift to Busy People, Regardless of Religion"".<p>I'm a skeptic when it comes to ""Religion"" type stuff, but meditation is one of those practices that has survived so long that I wondered if there was something practical to it.  The main point in that book is that meditation has nothing to do with religion, it's a personal productivity technique.  It's fundamentally about training your mind to focus on one thing for a period of time.  It seemed interesting and I didn't have to buy anything other than the book I'd already purchased to try it.  So I started doing it ten minutes a day, and let me tell you, the results have been impressive for me.  It's nothing more mystical than the ability to really intensely focus on something, one thing, without letting your mind wander.  If you think that's easy - give it a try, for just ten minutes.  It's surprising just how hard it is to contain your mind for that long.<p>Give it a try, before long, sitting still for two minutes is so easy you won't believe it.

It just happens that the implication is the ""wrong"" way around in my case. :-)<p>For example, moving to jobs with better working conditions and/or more interesting projects, leaving full-time work for the freedom of independent contracting, and ultimately forming my own company to build things that I hope others will enjoy or benefit from, are all moves I've made primarily for reasons other than money, but all tend to increase the money coming in as well.<p>I suppose I prefer to do worthwhile things with my working hours, but worthwhile things by their nature also tend to be better rewarded in a business environment.<p>(Edit: As a curious aside, my total amount of money coming in has actually decreased quite significantly in the past few years since I left full-time employment, but that is because while I have been earning higher rates per hour, I can now <i>choose</i> to spend fewer hours on the everyday pays-the-bills stuff in order to invest time in the newer ideas with better long-term potential for interesting work and/or high profitability. It had not even occurred to me before writing this post, but at some point I have stopped judging my financial position by the bottom line, and started judging it by the rate of income from different endeavours multiplied by the time I expect to spend on each of them in the future, with a footnote that the things I am doing right now still need to be above the threshold for paying the bills etc.)",1295551752

2124844,story,,,5,12,deffibaugh,"Ask HN:  Getting Better",,"I am senior working to finish up my undergraduate degree in Information Sciences and Technology.  As you might have guessed, IST is no CS degree.  I came to school not knowing what I wanted to do.  I was always kind of geeky growing up and I know a fair amount about tech so I decided to major in IST.  My programming experience was very modest and I wasn't sure I even liked so I didn't think I would get through CS.  Time went on and after having to work a internship at which I did PHP programming I found that I actually did enjoy the craft.  I learned as much as I could at work and this got me more work at two different startup companies doing Rails development.  I worked hard at each and I really fell in love with the hacker/startup lifestyle.  Unfortunately I have only been at it for about a year and half.<p>As I mentioned earlier in this post, I am graduating this spring.  I have not yet been able to find employment.  I somehow managed to get a phone screen Google in Pittsburgh that is scheduled.  I feel like I really lucked into it.  Regardless, I have been trying my hardest over the past few weeks to learn some CS principles on my own.  I ended up purchasing Introduction to Algorithms due to the recommendations from this site.  I have excepted that I am not at the level I need to be at yet to get through the interview with Google.  However, I am really motivated to get better.  I was wondering what the best approach is to tackle the self education of CS?  Should I read the book only when I need to reference it, or should I work through all the chapters doing all of the exercises?<p>I want to get better so that I don't have to take a job after school that is just a pay check.  I want to be able to work in a place that I continue to get better and hone a craft that I just recently discovered a passion for.  I just can't afford to get a CS degree at this point.",1295550311

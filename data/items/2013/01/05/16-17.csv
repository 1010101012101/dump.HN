Aliyun was, after all, accused of making Android apps available for Aliyun without the developers' OK. So Aliyun is as compatible as Kindle Fire.<p>There might be some reason Aliyun is different, but, so far, nobody has actually shown such a difference.<p>What's bad about this is that Google is putting a fence around code they have made available under the Apache license.",1357405171

Truth is, there are loads of short guys, ugly guys or otherwise challenged guys that get what they want out of dating, whether it's lots of random sleeping around, or a committed relationship, and everything in between.<p>Please don't talk about giving up on relationships. Online dating might actually not be the best choice for you. It creates the illusion of control and comfort from your living room. As you saw, it's tough work and you don't really learn much from it, not as much as you could learn if you spent the same amount of time outside meeting women.<p>Try to meet women in your day-to-day activities. Join classes. Get active. Go to bars and parties. I don't know where you're coming from, but if you're shy and lack confidence, make a point to talk to other people, and that includes attractive women. Also, you need to have a mindset of abundance, not of scarcity. There are plenty of women that'd like to be with you, if you go out to meet them and show them your true self and get your act together.<p>You'll get vastly better over time. But it does take time, so don't give up after 1 week :-)",1357405101

There is no Mac OS X support on Amazon EC2 (you can certainly blame Apple for that more than Amazon, but then you're just blaming Apple instead of Amazon). I'm sure you're aware of the kerfuffle over Microsoft shoving proprietary ""do it like this version of Microsoft Office"" specs into the OOXML standard over strenuous objections by competitors. Almost all of Microsoft's server products rely on Active Directory for feature completeness and don't play half as well with non-Microsoft implementations of LDAP or Kerberos.<p>If competitors had an obligation to support competing platforms then you could find no saints in this industry.<p>Edit: Incidentally, I'm really enjoying the irony of you loudly and repeatedly complaining about people downvoting pro-Microsoft content (notwithstanding that this story has remained on the front page for almost a full day) while your brethren simultaneously downvote my comments instead of responding to them.",1357404103

And I think dating sites attract many of us (as I am indeed a member of this subset.)<p>I'm talking about people who lack the pre-requisites women require for mate selection which if not fulfilled, no other characteristics typically matter. Firstly - height - if you are significantly below the national average, you will find obtaining a partner extremely difficult. I am 2 sigma below the average in my country (5'5"", UK). Oh dear. I think those who are not height-impaired find it hard to believe how much of a factor this is, but it really, really, really is.<p>If you lack a certain kind of (I venture to suggest, actually somewhat unpleasant, cocky) confidence, especially good looks or social standing, then your odds drop even more significantly.<p>From what I have read, the general experience of dating sites is that men get very few replies, and women are inundated, so the task for a man is to do anything to stand out, and the task for women is to filter. I think this exaggerates the already heavily filtering criteria listed above for those like myself.<p>However, dating sites give people like me hope, the idea that somehow we might get around this problem, somehow say the right thing or after enough messages sent we might find somebody. I wonder how many people like me fund these sites (OK Cupid have a blog with lots of stats, perhaps some data to work with there.)<p>I say 'from what I have read', as I have sent > ~150 messages with no reply whatsoever.

In a minimally viable education the pressure to not study these things goes away however there is no incentive to produce a student with marketable job skills.  I think this is okay because school should have never been about job training.<p>An education should prepare you for job training and job training should teach you a marketable skill.

The problem, however, is not him, and his desire for a ""low-maintenance"" woman who is hot, young, interested in him, and doesn't mind that he is callow and doesn't care very much about her. No, the problem is online dating, which has shown Jacob that he can have a steady stream of mediocre dates, some of whom will have sex with him.</i><p>I basically stopped reading at the ad hominem. An article that claims to be about ""evidence"" clearly is not if it needs to win reader approval by bashing the opposing subject. This was a theme in the Atlantic's comments section of the article in question, too.<p>We can't tell if Jacob is truly a ""douche"" or not. The last article was all about him but mainly focused on his dating life and not other circumstances of it. And he sounds like an average male professional...what seems offensive is that we're more privy to his desires and decisions and as they say, familiarity breeds contempt.<p>The OP also blasts the article for not including a single female voice. If we're trying to make an objective evaluation of the effect of online dating, then it does not matter if the article is single gender (either male or female). If it can be argued convincingly that one-half of a couple has much more incentive to leave, then that by definition is enough to have an effect on traditional relationships, no matter what the other gender thinks",1357401908

They can then subscribe to that ""bucket"" of data they have sent to the ""collector"" and it will let the subscriber know every time that event has happened.<p>This is a classic example of what Node is excellent at doing. Extremely low-latency IO handling that involves little-to-no computation.<p>It REALLY is that simple. Don't use Node for an application that is going to be a massive team effort (because sharing JavaScript code is a nightmare), and don't use it for an application that requires a good-deal of computation (something that you would use threads for in other languages/environments that isn't IO-handling).<p>The problem is that using Node (and all other things) requires a value judgement. Exactly how massive is too massive? And exactly how much computation is too much? The computation question gets a bit tricky to, because if it's computation that is extremely complicated but won't be executed all that often then Node may still be the right tool for the job.<p>The hype around Node is fading, because people ""In the know"", now have a clear understanding of what Node is good at and what it is bad at. The technical reasons why this is the case are not hard to grasp, but they take a while to explain and cannot be labelled as being ""all-good"" or ""all-bad"" (indeed Node's technical limitations have also given it some of its major strengths).",1357401778

5012955,comment,5010846,5012128,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> Have you seen the late J-dramas like 'kasefu no mita' or 'doctor X'?<p>I've heard of both, but haven't seen either. I've been meaning to, but as I mentioned before[0], part of the reason I was watching J-dramas was for Japanese reading/writing practice, so my dorama watching has dropped off after passing that phase of my studies. Hopefully I'll have some time to watch them this year, as they seem decent enough.<p>> I find those to be pretty good entertainment, however I don't know K-dramas. What I like a lot about Japanese media is, they don't tend to stretch their stories out just for a quick buck. Series with massive success like kasefu don't get sequels if their story is done.<p>The same policy exists for K-dramas. <i>Very few</i> get sequels, and those that do have generally turned out quite well, such as 2011's <i>Vampire Prosecutor</i>[1]. Sequels seem to be more popular on (the recently created) Korean cable networks, but even then they're not the stretched-out 5- or 6-year sagas you regularly see on American TV.<p>In any case, I would <i>highly</i> recommend checking out K-dramas - I mentioned a few good ones in another comment[0]. The production values, cinematography, set design, and acting are generally far better than they are for J-dramas. I find the actresses significantly more attractive as well, which never hurts ;)<p>0: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5011440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5011440</a><p>1: <a href=""http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Vampire_Prosecutor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Vampire_Prosecutor</a>",1357401690

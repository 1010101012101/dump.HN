5496582,comment,5495919,5496389,4,0,betterunix,,,"Is it really that arrogant to point out that the Bitcoin community has basically ignored the vast body of published, publicly available research on digital cash?  Even if the point of Bitcoin is to go in a separate direction and have no central authorities of any kind, that previous work is highly relevant.<p>There is no particular need for me to design a better digital cash system; such systems have already been designed.  It is not even clear that digital cash without a central authority <i>can</i> be provably secure, since nobody has proposed a security definition for digital cash that does not involve some currency issuing authority (no, Bitcoin's definition does not count -- it does not rule out feasible attacks).  Personally, I have no real problem with having a ""bank"" that issues currency, as long as the bank cannot frame people for double spending or other cheating (which is the kind of protection that was described by Chaum and other researchers in the 90s).<p>So really, the ball is in the Bitcoin community's court.  The research results on digital cash and secure multiparty computation is all publicly available and mostly available at no cost.  Let the Bitcoin community develop a definition of security for digital cash without any ""bank"" if that is their goal; all that I am saying is that the definition must rule out feasible attacks if we are expected to take it seriously.",1365130655

5496534,comment,5496285,5496285,13,0,orangethirty,,,"I'm not a 10x programmer. Probably will never be. I do know of programmers who not only are slower in shipping, but are very bad at designing coherent programs and data structures. That's my main observation. It's not that I'm X times better, its that they are X times slower and make poor design choices. Why? My experience has shown that this <i>tends</i> to happen with people who stop keeping up to date and stop learning.<p>Let's take my current job, for example. I'm working with a Python program designed to interact with 2 other programs. It is a middleman. The input comes in as text files, and the output goes out as text from a SQL query. The two programmers who built the system I'm working with (one from IBM, another from NASA, believe or not) had never heard of XML, or JSON. Every data structure inside the system is handled by reading and slicing around the contents of the text files. Slow, error prone, and tedious. My first step was to clean this up. I now have a small script that takes the input data text file and turns it into JSON. Since this data comes from an outside vendor, I don't get to pick the format (though I'm developing an API to handle this). After cleaning the data and saving it as JSON, I then simply load up the JSON file into memory and go through the program flow without issues. I removed the size of the program to about 25% of its original size. Plus its way, way faster. I also removed a bunch of database queries that simply did nothing. Was even able to add logging to the program.<p>Anyhow, the crazy part about it is that the actual code was worse. For those who know Python, using global variables for 
everything is considered pretty bad form. Here is an example that mimics the code base I inherited:<p><pre><code>    #they called lists arrays
    an_array = []
    def foo(array):
    global bar, global hello, global hi
    if bar <> 1:
        print ""something""
        array[0] = hi

</code></pre>
Yeah. But wait, there's more. There is a web app written in (what else) flat PHP. It handles very critical information, and is plagued with:<p><pre><code>    $foo = $_GET['foo'];
    sql = ""INSERT INTO TABLE.NAME VALUE($foo)""; //not actual SQL </code></pre>
They never clean, or sanitize the data. They don't even check if the GET array is empty.<p>It is obvious these two programmers stopped learning. They simply fell into what I call a <i>learning slump</i>. Where all new data simply goes out the moment it goes in.<p><pre><code>    #Like so
    def new_data(data):
        return data

    #Instead of
    def new_data(data):
        #process data
        #insert data into database
        </code></pre>
Yet, I don't want to call myself better, because most people here are better than me. Yet this leaves me with quite a strange view of everything. I'm not a great programmer, but I'm not as bad as those guys who worked at some big name place. Where does that leave me? Who knows.",1365129367

5496474,comment,5496329,5496329,1,0,creamyhorror,,,"I'd like to ask about the traditional technology consulting industry. Is it worth venturing into as a relatively inexperienced developer who wouldn't mind being a product manager?<p>There's a clear divide between the traditional IT services provider and the tech startup. Often (especially in secondary hubs like my country) the IT services players view developers as commodity labour to be hired as grunts or simply outsourced, while tech startups are often developer-centric and offer a much better experience and paycheck. What seems to matter is the orientation of the top management of the company; the traditional firms are often not run by software engineers or compsci people, but instead by general business folks.<p>Has any recent startup managed to become a significant player in tech consulting while retaining a developer-centric company culture? I'm interested in the idea of developers collaborating with sales/bizdev people to offer tech consulting services with a different spin. I don't know if the gung-ho hacker spirit meshes very well with the more, um, stodgy business types who'll make up the clientele, though. Anyone have successful examples?<p>It seems like the current tech consulting model undervalues developers and development, and I'd like to see that shaken up, especially in an industry as profitable as that. Or is it really all about marketing presentations and sales relationships in the end?<p>-----
Here's a good post on the topic by Paul Gallagher:<p><i>MNC's with a strong R&D focus, or the very successful software companies already do technical career planning quite well (I've worked in a corporate research lab that had a technical career ladder all the way up to chief scientist - who could actually be more senior and with better benefits than the CEO, depending on the incumbent).<p>However, in the ""real world""(!), the IT industry is predominantly sales, service and agency focused. i.e. businesses that are either selling/integrating existing products, or selling people/time/projects. There are very different dynamics at work than in R&D/PD:<p>- For consulting firms and agencies, it is usually the case that the best revenue contributors (the cash cows) are the mid-level technical staff (3-5 years experience). Beyond that, their margin % often drops, and it is also harder to sell full utilisation.<p>- The pressure to be than just a pure technical contributor ratchets up pretty quickly: you are expected to take on pre-sales, delivery management, and even business development the higher you go<p>- Despite many of the larger firms operating locally (Oracle, NCS, Accenture, IBM etc) having a focus on technical career development, you learn pretty quickly that it is not the way to earn the big bucks. If you have the aptitude, get into sales. Pre-sales is the best bet if you want to remain largely technical, but also earn more and do less (although my friends in pre-sales would probably argue that last point!)<p>- The net result is that there's a general expectation that you will grow into other responsibilities pretty early in your career and leave hard-core development behind (for the next batch of grads). It is not just a local problem, but it does vary in degree:<p>- My own experience is that it does vary from country to country, but not by much.

There are certainly a fair number of 1/10ers that manage to progress through seemingly normal career paths as programmers despite not being very good.

By the time the company has achieved some size, there's enough process and bureaucracy and projects mostly consist of what the OP described -- migrating from one framework to another, or some other incremental enhancement that's hardly pushing any sort of business of technology threshold.  At previous employers that fit this description, I could have easily been 10x more productive if I didn't have to endure  four hour sprint planning meetings or be required by an understaffed QA/DBA/sysadmin team to approve my code before release, all to do completely routine development changes that required no serious problem-solving.<p>This doesn't mean I'm a 10x developer.  It probably means I'm a 1x developer, so a 'true' 10x developer would have been 100x more productive without the aforementioned  bureaucratic crap.  At these companies that would dogmatically follow Agile and had two week sprints, I might spend four hours, across two days, actually developing -- with the rest of the days filled with various meetings, interviews, waiting for QA/DBA/sysadmins, fucking around, etc.  I could easily see how someone could spend only 15 minutes on what took me four hours, and his solutions would likely be more elegant.  It doesn't matter -- the limiting factor isn't the development time, or even the development quality.  In that environment, there is literally no difference in productive gains between a proficient developer and a 10x developer.<p>Given a ""10x developer"" is literally defined by his productivity/quality, if you think they're effectively overhyped/nonexistent, ask yourself this: are you in an environment where a 10x developer could actually demonstrate 10x productivity?  At most companies, the answer is no, because a 10x engineer is doing in hours what takes people days, and nobody notices.  But in the right environment, the 10x engineer will do in weeks what would take proficient engineers months, or do in months what would take <i>years.</i>  They're the people that Steve Yegge calls ""Done and Gets Things Smart""[0] or that Rands calls ""Free Electrons""[1].<p>And if you work at a company that can't think in terms of months because it's always concerned about quarterly earnings, then they have no use for 10x developer, and chances are you couldn't even tell if one was even there.<p>[0] <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/03/20/free_electron.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/03/20/free_electr...</a>",1365127968

The CWA lasted five days and was open to the public. Every single day of the conference, there was a Cinema Interruptus session. On the first session, attendees watched an film in its entirety. Over the next four sessions, the film was stopped - sometimes after a few minutes, sometimes after mere seconds - and Mr Ebert discussed the film with the attendees. Attendees were welcome to make their own comments, too; sometimes it was a hassle as there are people who just enjoy hearing themselves talk. But it was a great memory of mine that Mr. Ebert called one of my observations ""astute."" I was able to say hi and shake his hand after one of the sessions, and I was certainly impressed at how a person of such extraordinary merit would contribute his time every year to our beloved CWA in Boulder.<p>He will most definitely be missed.",1365127844

Factories like General Plastics may be seeing lower scores from job applicants because:<p>1) Racism 20 years ago may have prevented minorities from applying for jobs at these factories.  Now, policies, attitudes, and the workplace environment may encourage more african americans or hispanics to apply for these jobs.  The full NEAP reports make it clear that there is still a significant math performance gap between the overall population and whites.  A broader pool of applicants, reflecting less racism today, will result in lower math performance.  (This performance gap although significant is narrowing.)<p>2) Sexism 20 years ago could have precluded many women from applying for factory jobs.  Now with more women applying, the performance gap in math between women and men may affect the average results seen on General Plastics tests. (Unfortunately, this performance gap hasn't narrowed over time.)<p>3) Improved opportunities for students from lower income families to go to college (because of student loan programs) may be causing the lower test scores at General Plastics.  There is a significant performance gap in math and reading associated with family income, so it is more likely that students from lower income families apply for factory jobs rather than go to college today. Twenty years ago even the better performing students from low income families might not have been able to go to college because of the expense.  Now, the better students from this pool will go to college (supported by student loans, etc.) changing the population that will be applying for factory jobs.<p>I'm not sure if any of these possibilities is true, but they are alternative hypotheses not considered by the article.

I fully agree with you that it's probable that the HTML was copied, but it was substantially altered in any case. And I must admit that that's a crime that I'm guilty of as well and I doubt that there's any web developer out there that never did something alike, just as there is no designer out there that never copied an arrow-icon.<p>My point is that the whole article smells of ""we wanted to be insulted"", name calling and call to action included.

5775343,comment,5773909,5774828,21,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Proper occupation can be and has been done many times in history, but it takes a force at least somewhat proportional to the population; which the west doesn't really want to afford.</i><p>Controlling a territory has been done many times with a very small force.  The key is set up a hierarchy and have locals do the door-to-door ground work.  Flying in the imperial marines to patrol every village street in backcountry Afghanistan is completely insane.<p>Historically, the way to control a territory is as follows: you go to each region and you find the local strongman with the best combination of reliability and strength available.  You say: ""We will support your control of this region, if you provide security and support our imperial policies [those policies could be anything, depending on the desires of the imperialist.  It could be providing natural resources, converting people to a certain religion or even spreading woman's rights].  If you support our policies, you will otherwise have freedom to rule according to local custom.  We will provide you money and resources.  If you fail to support our policies, we will violently remove you.""<p>Under such a policy, you do not need hundreds of thousands of imperial soldiers patrolling the lands, you just need enough soldiers to remove any local warlords that get out of line.<p>This raises the question: why hasn't the U.S. done the above?  My theory is that the U.S. leadership are actually True Believers in democracy.  The above method of rule makes it impossible to spread democracy, because the occupying power must choose the strongman - the locals cannot choose the leader via elections. Since the U.S. wishes to spread democracy, it cannot use this method of rule. Furthermore, such overt imperialism contradicts the U.S.'s founding myth as being born out of resistance to imperialism.  Few states can overtly contradict their founding myths.  So instead, the U.S. has chosen to maintain security with its own forces, so that the locals can have elections and choose local leaders, as part of a transition to democracy.",1369673772

And so a multinational is always going to have a decision to make about exactly how aggressive they choose to be. And they are going to be judged morally by the taxpayer for the decisions they make, whether they like it or not.<p>If they are judged badly as a result of their choices, they should have the good grace to just admit that they're being selfish because they can get away with it and that's the way things are, and not come up with disingenuous self-serving rationalisations.",1369673608

I've seen avg. CPCs fall by 10 - 50% (depending on the industry) when Quality Score changed from 5 to 7 for keywords. You can actually track Quality Score and overlay it with avg. CPC and other stats to see a correlation for your account. We created a tool for doing this.
The second is Google's suggested cost per click which is the recommended first page bid that Google shows next to each keyword. This is a function of your Quality Score and competition. You'll notice that keywords with a low Quality Score have a relatively high required first page bid. Please feel free to email me (geetanjali att optmyzr.com) with any questions!",1369673213

My son is almost the same age as the startup I'm working on.<p>At times it is tough, luckily I have an understanding wife. And my son is one of the biggest reasons I get up in the morning.<p>Being a parent is like a roller-coaster (much like working on a startup). You're sad and stressed when your child gets sick. And a child also gives you some of the greatest joys in life you can have - there's nothing like coming home after a hard day, only to find your child smiling at your return, giving you a big hug or a kiss, never missing a day to express how much he/she loves you.<p>There is a difference between being a parent and working on a startup. Both have highs and lows, however while working on a startup, in stressful times one tends to adopt a fuck-it attitude. Like, if it doesn't work out, that's OK, you learn from experience and then you move on, so there's no tragedy if your startup fails. Not so with a child ... you only have one shot to raise him right, to provide a good education, to make him happy and balanced and that child becomes your biggest reason detre, regardless of how passionate you are about other things, like software development or your startup.<p>So that's why my son is probably the biggest reason for why I get up in the morning.<p>Burn-outs for example are a non-issue for me. I've been burned-out before and it's hard to explain for why this can no longer happen - but the gist is my son is like a mirror of me, so his well-being functions like a benchmark. When I'm sad, then he's sad too and I can't fake happiness in front of him (children have a sixth sense about that), so whenever that happens, it's time to evaluate whatever I'm doing wrong and cut out on the stress. You see, I simply can't afford to burn-out, as my son depends on me. Same issue I have with catching colds for example - I used to catch colds quite frequently, but ever since my son was born, my immune system seems to have strengthened quite a bit. I'm not joking, it's as if my body knows that I need to be stronger and acts accordingly.<p>So yes, it's possible. If you feel the need to be a parent and you have a spouse that agrees with you, then postponing it is going to be the singly most stupid thing you'll ever do. That's because (1) children are worth it and (2) when it comes to having children, you only have a limited window of opportunity and before you know it, you'll be too old and even with all medical advances in this field, it's better to have them while you're young.",1369672966

It's easy to blame the law (a process which is mostly just a self-reinforcing talking point), but has it occurred to anyone that maybe neither the law nor Google are ""crooked?""<p>You can take the most straightforward law and it still won't withstand a company putting all their IP in a tax haven and then attributing most of their revenues to their tax haven subsidiary. That's not taking advantage of a ""loophole"" that's taking advantage of the fact that: 1) accounting for revenue is inherently complicated, regardless of the tax laws, especially for service businesses and software services businesses at that; and 2) multi-national corporations must have some way to attribute income to the various countries in which they operate; it wouldn't be fair for every country to individually tax all the company's income separately.<p>It's instructive to try and figure out a tax law that would allow say the U.K. to reach some portion of Google's income. It's harder than it seems. For example, is it relevant that Google has customers in the U.K.? It shouldn't be--there is no sales tax on search services. If someone in the U.K. for example calls up their accountant in the U.S. for advice, as a general rule the accountant isn't liable for income taxes in the U.K. Is it relevant that Google has servers in the U.K.? Sure. But how relevant? How much of the value of Google's service derives from the servers in the U.K. versus the code and algorithms that were developed in California? I think most people would agree that the servers are just incidental--the real value of Google's services is the algorithms and data. So why should the mere existence of servers in the U.K. entitle the country to tax some substantial amount of Google's income?",1369672779

claims of a ""mix"" seem to be not correct.<p>Further, much of the problem the US has had with
Pakistan is from the strong role of Islam there

domestic politics, and foreign policy, Pakistan

The comments also apply a lot to Iran and Iraq.
For Pakistan, sure, it used to be part of India

what it got from the British, and the old 
cultures from before the British.  India
is a forbiddingly complicated place, and
Pakistan has been influenced by that.<p>But the main reason for the formation of

If there's a way to discuss terms and details on a prospective project, I haven't found it yet.<p>* Getting paid, in the US, is difficult, expensive, slow, and impossible to automate.  (It was none of those things on vWorker).<p>* The vibe of the site is incompatible with high quality, professional contracting.  If I send clients to your site, they don't hear about cost and schedule and deliverables.  They get asked to follow you on twitter so they can level up and win a free t-shirt.<p>* No sub-accounts.  I can't give an administrative assistant or subcontractor partial access to my account; it's either cut and paste or give out the master password.<p>* The whole setup seems geared toward people with a very different business philosophy than me -- hundreds of bids per month, dozens of skills on your profile, tens of client relationships.  And if I work hard, I could get more of all of those things!  That actively drives me away.  I <i>have</i> dozens of skills, but I only want to list one or two.

Afghan youth probably realizes even more than the American one that they are simply pawns in the system and no one outside their families cares for them. The Afghani youth are likely illiterate by most standards, and it sounds like the soldiers keep absolutely terrible records accordingly. As much as we trash the American education system (which is flawed), we at least have a pretty decent baseline for education to create soldiers that can read/write/math.<p>Whereas the American youth probably thinks that they are fighting for their country and doing great good around the world, I'm not entirely sure that the Afghan youth would think of it that way. At best, they are fighting for a paycheck, a gun, and some temporary protection.<p>As you point out, the basic supply chain of infrastructure is lacking there. We've given them the tools such as solar panels (which they feature in the doc), but if something messes up they have no idea how to fix them. Corruption isn't a bad thing, its being smarter and probably closer to survival than anything. The motivation to stay and fight in a dangerous situation is exceedingly low; whereas an American soldier can at least hope for a memorial, benefits to their spouse, and honors if they are killed in action, there is certainly none of that for the Afghan youth.<p>I guess to top that off, we're all left holding the question of why we're over there at all.

A few decades ago, there was published a book that popularized the avalanche theory, and the book was translated into English too. However, many people including the participants of the search expedition are saying that it could not be an avalanche. The ski poles were standing around the tent vertically, not affected by the avalanche. There is an evidence that the tent was not really covered with thick snow, and there was a flashlight laying on top of this snow (belonged to the group leader Igor Dyatlov). The slope is not steep at all, maybe 15-20 degrees. There were found footprints of 8-9 people walking away from the tent in organized ordered fashion. It could not happen if 3 or 4 of them were heavily injured by an avalanche. Even if there was some sort of avalache in the area, it just does not explain the whole crazyness, imho. And it is very unlikely that just a noise could make 9 sane people run away from their only shelter, without putting on any warm clothes or boots.. yes, most of them were walking down the hill with only socks on their feet.
In my opinion, it is more likely that they were killed by another group of people, but there is no direct evidence of that either.<p>There are many other theories and possible explanations. The UFO theory is absurd of course, but, you know, people come up with such bizarre explanations because reasonable explanations are not very believable either. This is why many people are still trying to solve the mistery, they make expeditions in the area of Dyatlov Pass, trying to understand what could happen there in 1959. Probably, only new declassified documents, if there will be any, can shed some light on this mystery..<p>Btw, you can look at the photos taken by the group members (from the films found in their cameras):

There's been reports that Skype is being listened to in China

We all know that Microsoft has replaced Skype ""supernodes"" with Linux boxes moving from p2p-architecture to a more traditional one.

It's been discovered that some web-bot with a Redmond IP-address crawls all https-links you post into a Skype conversation (here's the source translated from German).

Jeffrey Nokel from the University of New Mexico has discovered that the Chinese installer even comes with a keylogger that ""listens"" to some specific ""bad"" words and combinations and sends them to the secret service later...

There's a lot of object oriented analogies between programming and cooking.  If you can apply the ""Julienne knife cut"" method to a potato object, you can do it to an apple object and probably a carrot too.<p>Its a big linear programming puzzle to scale recipes.  Did I mention scaling?  Cooking is a whole barrel of square/cube law scalability puzzles to get cooking rates of different ingredients to intersect at one completion time.<p>There are some pretty interesting software engineering principles WRT recipe and meal design.  Do you ""waterfall"" your holiday dinner design, or ""agile"" it?
There's the sheer queueing theory joy of arranging everything just so, such that its all just-in-time ready to be cooked, when it works its awesome and when you're stuck in the weeds its panic time, just like hacking something before a demo.<p>Its fun to iterate thru optimization getting the ""design pattern"" applied to the puzzle better and better.  And there's so many design patterns, and if you stay out of pastry work, those design patterns are pretty flexible.<p>One point where you have me is most programmers hate testing, so I can see an issue with cooking.<p>I am kinda bummed that most ""computer geeky"" books about cooking fixate solely on gadgetry like liq N2 or molecular gastronomy, cool as that might be, there's a whole nother world of describing cooking with flowcharts and object oriented methods and development models and algorithms and ""real computer geeky"" stuff like that.<p>I have noticed that at least some people cook like they program, across a sample size of about 3.

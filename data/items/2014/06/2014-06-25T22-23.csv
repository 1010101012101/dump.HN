In practice you need to consider things like speed, volume, scale, consistency, redundancy, computation, ad-hoc vs. planned operations, use of resources (disk, memory, CPU, GPU), etc. And as most NoSQL systems just aren&#x27;t as mature as their table-based counterparts, you&#x27;ll also have to factor in your tolerance for issues and general system crankiness. All that being said, some applications just cry out for graphs, particularly apps that involve items linked in pairs. Social apps (people linked by friendships), travel (places linked by flights), communications (people linked by messages), all of these can play hell with an SQL database but are naturals for graph databases.",1403737185

7947212,comment,7943964,7946950,4,0,alexqgb,,,">Is it just because one involves repeated payments?<p>No, it&#x27;s illegal because it involves reselling streamed or broadcast content (as opposed to content on physical media which can be resold under the doctrine of first sale) which is illegal regardless of whether it&#x27;s done for one-time or ongoing payment. Commercial re-transmission is the real bone of contention.<p>>Would it be legal for Aereo to charge a one-time fee instead of a subscription service? Or is the problem that Aereo owns the property where the physical antenna resides? Does my personal antenna+streamer have to reside on property which I own directly?<p>Probably irrelevant, since they&#x27;re still running a commercial service. That means the signal in question is not being pulled down by a private individual for personal, non-commercial use. It&#x27;s being pulled down by a commercial company for the benefit of its customers. That puts it on the wrong side of the law.<p>Of course, if Aero were set up as a co-op, and its customers were owners of not just the antennas but the building etc. and were mutually responsible for the electricity and so on, then perhaps it could get around the law. But that&#x27;s purely hypothetical, where as the Supreme Court was ruling on the (very different) reality.<p>>What if I rent my apartment? Heck, my Internet connection is a subscription service, and I neither own nor operate any of the Internet equipment myself.<p>If you rent your apartment from a landlord who charges you an additional fee for access to the wire running from the building&#x27;s rooftop antenna to your flat, then the landlord is the one on the wrong side of the law.<p>As far as your ISP is concerned, they are treated by law (as far as content goes) in the same way that the telephone companies are treated. That is to say, they cannot be held partially responsible for any infringing uses you may use of their service, in the same way that the phone company can&#x27;t also be charged with conspiracy when two gangsters use their system to plot a crime.<p>In terms of the internet, this comes from the Safe Harbor provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA, 1998. In determining whether a network operator is partially responsible for infringing uses, the critical test is the source of the content. If they were the ones who put it on the network, they they can be held liable. But if (as in the case of YouTube or Dropbox) they&#x27;re simply the hosts for material that others upload at their discretion, they are protected from liability. There&#x27;s major caveat in that they must pull the content down if the owner of the content notifies them that its presence on the network is infringing. If they fail or refuse to honor a take down request, then they lose their legal immunity.<p>Aero is not protected by Safe Harbor since they&#x27;re the ones who introduce the content to their network when they initially pull it off the air. Again, if they were run as a co-op (meaning there was no legal difference between the owners of the equipment and its end users) the case may have gone differently. But as they are an unprotected third party placing themselves in the middle of a legally protected broadcast transmission, and doing so on a commercial basis, they&#x27;re doing so in violation of the law.",1403736714

Does that mean every array gets the overhead of having room for that mark or do these marks live elsewhere? If so, where, and how is code checking it going to be performant?<p>- in nested calls, are you going to allow multiple marks? (Solvable, I think, as you can get away with an integer mark count)<p>- that would mean that all code that modifies any array must check whether such a mark is present and then find the return address on the stack (and nested return addresses)<p>- even if you do all of the above, the simple checking for presence of such a mark can kill performance in tight loops, even if you do that with branch prediction hints.<p>- how do you know what mutating changes are important for the calling code? You can use a function pointer as the &#x27;mark&#x27; and call that so that it can figure it out by itself, but that surely will kill performance in tight loops.<p>I think the normal way is for compiled functions to detect when their own assumptions (may) no longer hold, not for other code to signal any compiled code on the stack that its assumptions (may) no longer hold. In tight frequently run code, you may be able to inline calls and recompile, but that is costly, too.<p>EDIT: I just realize that it is possible to do something in the spirit of this without needing any marks. The really bad calls, such as those to eval, will have to tell the JIT compiler that the current game is over, and that they can start over. It is too costly to do that from any innocuous call, such as that which adds an item to an array, though.<p>As to that length optimization: it use to say that C doesn&#x27;t have a for loop; because it evaluates the end condition through every iteration, its &#x27;for&#x27; is a &#x27;while&#x27; in disguise.

If you get kicked out of an affordable place and nothing else affordable is available, compensation only delays the inevitable by a few months.<p>Maybe if nothing is affordable in a strict 121km^2, a more affordable location convenient to public transportation in the larger 9,128km^2 metro area should be looked into. Like Oakland, perhaps?<p>People get priced out of Manhattan and end up moving to one of the other boroughs all the time (though now that people are getting priced out of Williamsburg, they&#x27;re moving _back_ to portions of Manhattan like the LES). It sucks, but that&#x27;s the life of a renter.<p>> For the most part I&#x27;m inclined to agree that, if landlords are being abusive assholes, it&#x27;s a problem with the landlords, not with the wealthy tenants or their employers.<p>Depends. If they&#x27;re being abusive assholes within the law, it&#x27;s a problem with the law. You can&#x27;t assume - especially with landlords - that economic actors will choose the path to Nash equilibria. If they&#x27;re abusive assholes outside of the law, it&#x27;s a problem with the landlords. IMHO, an Ellis Act eviction isn&#x27;t abusive - just because it&#x27;s not abusive doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fair, however. A landlord in Brooklyn recently told his tenants that he was going to do repairs - and instead of repairing the property, he (allegedly) gutted the apartment (removed flooring, plumbing fixtures). All to try and force them to abandon their lease. This was abusive -- and illegal (he&#x27;s almost definitely going to jail). But it&#x27;s also an artifact of the extraordinary tenant rights we enjoy here in NYC: we cannot be evicted without cause, and even then the landlord must win an eviction suit in (a very pro-tenant) housing court. If a landlord wants a tenant out for reasons not valid (e.g., to convert to condos or a mansion), they can offer to buy the tenant out of their lease. The tenant, of course, can refuse the buyout until they receive a price they consider fair. These tenants can be a huge headache for landlords that want to improve or demolish the property.<p>Seems to me that the Ellis Act itself is what&#x27;s abusive here, not landlords taking advantage of the law.<p>> Still, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect major employers to assist with the needs of their community<p>It might not be unreasonable, but it&#x27;s extraordinarily unlikely. Corporations are in it for profit. Making sure people have affordable housing in downtown San Francisco doesn&#x27;t really enter into it.<p>> If Google&#x27;s policies are indirectly enabling shitty landlords<p>What policy is that? Employing shrewd lawyers? Not being punitive when their employees take full advantage of the law?<p>If you think invoking the Ellis Act is being a shitty landlord, you live in a wonderland of amazing landlords my friend. I&#x27;m still trying to get mine to fix my foyer mailbox after six months of it being broken (thank goodness for PO boxes).<p>> it would be neighborly of Google to use their clout to lobby for pro-tenant ordinances<p>Google isn&#x27;t just neighbors with SF. Google is a global company: its neighbors are the entire world. That&#x27;s why its nonprofit arm builds things like Person Finder, Flu & Dengue Trends, discounted access to its products for non profits. It also invests in research for renewable energy cheaper than coal (though was dropped in 2011), seeds plug-in EVs, prediction & prevention of emerging (climate & disease) threats, uses its information to improve public services in the developing world, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<p>They&#x27;ve got bigger fish to fry than doing San Franciscan&#x27;s civic duty for them.",1403735713

Typical navel gazing, utility-uber-alles (at least for things that &quot;I&quot; am not interested in) programmer who is more concerned with some kind of compatibility (of course using IT examples) than anything else.<p>Even if we only strictly consider languages themselves, what if some people find pleasure in them? You can&#x27;t say that what they enjoy doing is wrong with some argument for its utility - because the use and consumption of that language is a utility in itself. Neither can you confine them to these &quot;museums&quot; since they might want to use it outside of the halls of dusty books. Then, so much for &quot;one and only one language&quot;.<p>Now, considering not just the language but culture. Languages are so incredibly context dependent and vague that I think they are deeply intertwined with culture. Outside of whatever you can laboriously define and enshrine in some book to stuff in a museum, there are incredible nuances that can be hard to appreciate if one is not involved with it, through things like social interaction and the written word. If you lose or discard the language of some culture, then you might also lose an appreciation for a lot of subtleties and ways of thinking. Words and expressions that might seemingly translate easily may have nuances that only an active speaker of the language can appreciate.<p>Thirdly. Consider if we with one magical button could make everyone in the world speak one language, say English. Now we are all on the same page! Then fast forward a few units of time - are we still speaking the same language? Probably, but we might have developed distinct dialects in different corners of the world. Why? Because every society and culture practising the language &quot;evolved&quot;, namely added new expressions, words, phrases. Even pronunciation (accents). Why didn&#x27;t the language simply evolve in the same way, worldwide? Of course because of the fact that the world is made up of a lot of different places and cultures. All of these cultures affect each other, but it&#x27;s like a web of intermingling sharing. There is, largely, not a single, dominating culture, and so there is no central &quot;authority&quot; on how the language is going to evolve naturally. But you <i>need</i> a single &quot;reference&quot; point for this language to evolve in a uniform way, and avoid a lot of dialects! So if the goal is to have a single language, and a single dialect, your only bet is cultural imperialism. But culture is just a silly thing that just gets in the way, right? Better just stuff them in a museum and adopt a single, standardized culture. It&#x27;s so efficient!<p>Given enough time, these dialects might turn into their own languages (let&#x27;s say that languages are now distinguished by not being mutually intelligible with each other). Then you&#x27;re back to the same problem, basically. Well, it&#x27;s a lot better since all of these languages are closely related. And maybe these languages would never really become their own languages, since there is sufficient inter-cultural, global communication to avoid any significant divergence. But to eventually have no dialecs, no linguistic misunderstandings? Something&#x27;s gotta give, namely everyone has to adopt the same culture and pallet of beliefs and values. But I guess that kind of robotic efficiency would be a Utopia for you.",1403735028

Anderson and this author seem to be surprised that you can get so far with an incomplete theory that doesn't explain everything.  That seems obvious to me -- remember classical mechanics?<p>Here's a particularly bad example:<p><i>""When you misspell a word when googling, Google suggests the proper spelling. How does it know this? How does it predict the correctly spelled word? It is not because it has a theory of good spelling, or has mastered spelling rules. In fact Google knows nothing about spelling rules at all.""</i><p>""Spelling rules"" are a heuristic extrapolation just like the one Google is making, but are probably less accurate!  Why is a set of rules designed to be memorable and useful to a human more of a theory than rules that you have to write down, and need a computer to use?",1214758616

When I was at Motorola long ago, I stumbled across an outline of how to compete against other cell phone companies. Technological innovation was a minor point. Most of it was using legal tactics to tie up competitors, confounding standards bodies, securing exclusive deals with some countries, etc. It also talked about how competitors were doing the same thing.<p>I think if you ran a business and didn't do these things, you'd be roadkill on the information highway.",1214758045

231253,comment,231153,231153,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There are huge implications. Think about real estate - the demand to build new homes. That could impact millions of people in their employment. Think about systems like Social Security, where a large young working class pays for the retired class.<p>There is a trend followed very closely in robotics about the number of elderly people per worker. The larger that ratio gets, the more we'll need robots. And not in 30 years -- in 15 years. We need to support the baby boomers. They'll be 70+ in 7 years. It's even worse in Japan.<p>The cultural landscape will also change significantly. The Muslim minorities might not be minorities for long. This is a change of epic proportions.",1214757715

231246,comment,231040,231040,0,0,randallsquared,,,"This didn't match my own experience.  I spent the last few years being poor, and I felt like I had to be working all the time.  If I wasn't doing something that could potentially bring money in, I felt guilty.  Recently, I moved to the DC area and got a salaried job.  Even though I've had a 4 hour (total) commute each day, I actually feel like I have more free time and am more relaxed than I did when I was making one third to one fourth as much, mostly because I'm not freaked out about money at all times.<p>That's probably much of the reason that people report being happier: if you've made less than 10K so far in 2008, and don't know when your next check will come in, or from whom, your life is going to be pretty stressful.  If you have a steady >50K job, any monetary problems are pretty optional.",1214756879

So this isn't enough information to compare how the birth rate among Americans of European descent compares to the birth rate in Europe itself... which I agree would be interesting.<p>Edit: I also agree about it being tiring to even skim that article. I do love it, though, when apocalpytic crises directly contradict each other. Weren't we all going to die because of exponential population growth?",1214756854

231235,comment,231153,231153,0,0,mynameishere,,,"My god, I could barely stand to skim that. So, so much nothingness in so many words. A few points:<p>1. There is no crisis. Certain conditions produce certain effects. When smallpox is introduced into a population, the population declines, but subsequent generations resist it. The modern world has a perfectly consistent effect on population size, roughly the same as smallpox. The fittest, as always, will survive, and subsequent generations will not have the same problem.<p>2. The United States is not a ""sparkling exception"", if you correct your samples. If you reduce Americans to their European subset, you see that <i>Birth rate was 11.6 for Non-Hispanic Whites</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_Stat...</a> ... the lowest of all major groups.<p>3. The subject of immigration should not come up. Europe will not ""save itself"" by replacing itself with North Africans. This point warrants no discussion. If you <i>hate Europe</i> as much as the editors of the nytimes, that's another matter, and it's a valid viewpoint to the degree that it is open. It's not open, of course.<p>4. Europe and Japan are both far too crowded. As long as the situation isn't treated like a crisis, with hopeless policies (mass immigration, mass boondoggles) the long-term effect will be positive.<p>5. Three big groups who've reversed the trend: Mormons, Albanian muslims, and Ultra-orthodox Jews. A portend of things to come, and it's no surprise that the nytimes is troubled by the situation resolving itself.",1214755963

It sums up a lot of things I've kind of known for a while: places with better social systems like the Nordic countries are better places to have children than in somewhere like Italy (where I'm writing from, on vacation) which is, very sadly, going nowhere fast.  Having our daughter Helen in Austria was far easier, despite the language barrier, than it would have been in Italy.",1214755727

Especially since it would have hurt other people more than it hurt the perpetrators.<p>Threatening them with a media leak was one option. But it didn't seem to be a very good one, not to me or any of my mentors.

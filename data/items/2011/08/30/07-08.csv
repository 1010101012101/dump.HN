""With that being said, because the scanners have both a radiation source AND a detector in the front AND back of the person in the scanner, it is actually possible for the hardware to conduct a classic, through-the-body X-ray...So the hardware has the capability to output quite high doses of radiation...""<p>The conclusion does not follow from the premise.

Comodo should scrutinize their customers better or THEY should get blacklisted (taking all their other resellers with them) at least until they made sure that their clients have all resolved their security issues",1314688749

The price premium the wealthy are willing to pay allows schools to massively subsidize their brain drain of the brightest students.  If you get into stanford and your parents make less than 60k, you don't pay tuition at all.  The alternative is rationing which leaves just as many students out in the cold but doesnt allow the school to capture extra rents.<p>So the other issue is inelastic supply.  This is partially down to the regulatory environment, but that isn't the whole picture.  I haven't done enough research to understand why there aren't more schools starting up.  I suspect it's an accreditation barrier to entry issue.",1314688573

It takes tremendeous effort to do what you have achieve.  :)<p>To be motivated, one need to know his/her goal towards it.  I read your post here, but I don't see yoru goal.  Your friend has a goal of growing a community around a new programming language.  That's why he beats you on stuff. :)<p>If you want to be motivated, relax, think for a while (take as much time as you need), and decide what you want to do out of it.<p>For example, if you have hobby of restoring cars, your motivation is the goal of having the restored car in running condition with pristine condition.  THat's how car restorer stays motivated because they know what they want to achieve.<p>Think about what you want to achieve, what goal you want to set...<p>Come back here with that in mind, and we might be able to help you set up steps to ensure that you can stay motivated.",1312167573

Cherry-picked example factor. Hardcoding date strings is doubly bad, as they are usually provided by any modern system.

You're asking a health question about your personal situation and getting other peoples help, whether it's through their own experience, knowledge or whatever it may be. In some ways its even more reliable because you have other people to verify what worked for them and what didn't. You don't get that type of raw, personal information from referencing facts on a sheet of paper.<p>#2 You're not only getting raw information, but you get it targeted to your specific situation because you can ask questions. This means you can share different details and nuances about your situation and get answers that are directly related to that. Some people may have a paraticular health question and will resaearch online for hours and just find information that's not really targeted to their unique situation. Curenote lets you ask a specific question and get targeted answers.<p>#3 There are other health forums out there, but Curenote is designed to be easier to use and read, while looking beautiful and elegant. A lot of forums are badly designed with text that's hard to read, littered with ads all around, spam comments and hard to use navigations. Curenote strives to do better. It also only focuses on the key health topics that most people are inundated with everyday. These aren't just topics that affect the elderly, but teenagers and young adults as well.",1312167100

If Airbnb absolves themselves in their policy docs, then there's not much they have to do if something bad happens. On the contrary, however, they obviously need to have a serious overhaul of how they portray security to customers, as well as the vetting process for renters. Also, developing some sort of insurance program will help to skirt some major issues. I'm glad this is happening now, though, before someone gets hurt. Hopefully Airbnb will look at these events as warnings and take the necessary steps to refine how they protect themselves and their customers.",1312166234

We have sets of minimum requirement needed to launch and we also need to develop more customized features onto it.  Thats where you come in, to customized these features and put the finishing touch on the site. Once the minimum requirements are done, we will launch the site in beta mode.  We are hoping to launch the site within couple months after you are on board (the launching time is depending on full time/part time work you are doing as the technical co founder). Then when the YC Winter 2012 program application starts, we are going to apply for the program.  Our goal is if we can have few hundreds (or thousands) users base before going into the program, that would be a great achievement.<p>What we need is someone who is strong in web engineering to help us in technical areas and take it to the next level while we are going to do the testing development of the site, business development, funding, user base, marketing, and opportunities.  We are looking for help from the following candidate<p>- Can-do attitude, never give up, and love to solve problems (there is always a solution to every problem)<p>- You will be one of the co founder, we are partners. We move forward, fall backward and work together to achieve great things.<p>- software development experience as an web/internet engineer and experience in building back end web engine.<p>- Strong knowledge and proven hands-on experience with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, AJAX, CSS<p>- Desire and ability to learn, excel, and 100% commitment to success.<p>- Must be located in Bay Area (or willingness to relocate) as we will work together day and night to make it happen<p>- Prefer that you are available for full time to develop (as you will be working with one of the co founders on daily basis as he puts his effort full time on this), but we can discuss what you need and required in discussion.  What's really important is that you want to work with us, we want to work with you, and we are in it together.<p>Nice to have (but not required)<p>- Developed a production worthy SaaS application<p>- Experience building large scale applications is desired<p>- Strong desire to work in a startup, prior experience gets bonus points<p>- Knowledge of software development processes (Agile, Scrum) is desired but not necessary<p>All in all, we are looking for a passionate and genius web developer who likes social interaction, build sites, and is always challenged to make something better for the world.  When we combine your coding prowess with the vision on where we are going, we can only move forward.<p>A little bit about us.<p>One is a second time entreprenuer, worked at a fortune 50 company prior to this. His educational background is MSc in Electrical Engineering.  Expert in creating intuitive user experience, user interaction, and user values. Understand the market and eyeballing opportunities. Passionate about UI, startups, technology. Several years of experience in the wireless engineering and product management domain in wireless and mobile space. He loves to solve problems, creates opportunities, and love challenges. He will devote his time 100% day and night for this effort.<p>One is recent Cal graduate currently working at a startup company.  His educational background is BSc in Chemical Engineering.<p>You <insert your profile> :)<p>Why diving in social networking market with Facebook domination?<p>Because we believe that the social networking site has a lot of potential to grow because as of now, it has only Facebook in it, and the market will give us the chance the grow (considering what Google+ has achieve in its first month of its launch, there will be huge growth to make).  It's a great task and huge challenge ahead, but hey, if we are looking forward to it, then you must be too (no die attitude).<p>If you are interested in joining us and build a social networking site that offers values, please email us your experience at<p>rush.tea@gmail.com<p>We are going to look at all candidates regardless of background.<p>We are looking forward to great success together.

2830394,story,,,7,7,alecbenzer,"Ask HN: Advice on staying inspired/motivated",,"tl;dr - programmer, need motivation/inspiration, can't finish projects, I lose interest and get depressed<p>I'm 18 years old, just finished high school in June. I've been doing coding-type stuff since around 5th grade, so for around 7 years? I've known a ""real"" programming language (C++) for maybe 5 years, been into web development for like 3 or 4. I'd like to think of myself as a pretty intelligent individual (warning: I'm also fairly narcissistic). To date, I can't really think of a complete project that I've undertaken that I've seen from start to end. I realize I'm pretty young, but I've also been trying for 7 years. And with the exception of a few small projects, none of the projects I've started seem to finish themselves. This mostly applies to projects I choose to start myself, or otherwise don't have a ""client"". When I have a client I tend to finish things. Once, a friend (M) and I were asked by a teacher to build a mock election system that would track votes during the last US pres. election. We finished that. More recently, I was in charge of making a web system that would manage a conference a club at our school held annually. I finished that. But when it comes to projects that don't have a direct client, I can't finish them.<p>Throughout high school, my friend, M, would push me to work on projects with him. Sometimes I would agree, but eventually as the project went on and on I would lose interest and stop working on it, which would normally cause him to stop, too. Other times I would refuse to work on things with him. I can't really remember exactly why, but I think it had to do with me seeing that I would eventually loose interest, and deciding to start the project up would just boil down to another folder in ~ reminding me of yet another project I couldn't finish. I don't think that covers all the situations, because I remember once us having an argument where he was complain about how I find problems with everything and I explained that finding problems with existing technologies is how we get new technologies, or something like that. Anyway, I don't see how that argument would have stemmed from the reasoning I gave above. Oh, and we argued a lot, too. Mostly over gchat, and I can't help but think that part of it was that we just didn't match up very well in terms of our abilities to express ourselves via only text. But we would've probably still argued a bit regardless. I forget the details of what we argued over, or why they came up in general. Once it was about whether or not Haskell could be as fast as C, or what C++'s flaws are, random things like that. A lot of tension would build up between us like that.<p>Anyway, after a while my friend kind of just started doing stuff on his own. He got involved in a community growing around a new programming language and did some work for them (though I think now his involvement has died out). One of the bigger things he did recently was launching a site that became fairly popular, in the context of the web, and really popular, in the context of stuff either of us had really accomplished before. The site's popularity came back to him in a pretty big way, not long after. Basically, we were both trying for the same school. In terms of numbers (GPA/SAT) I had him beat, noticeably. But in terms of stuff we had done that we could actually show off, he had me beat, pretty noticeably, and the site he launched was a big part of that. Anyway, he ended up getting in and I didn't.<p>I got used to not getting into schools pretty quickly after that. The school he got into was probably my first choice. On top of not getting in there, I got waitlisted at my second choice, and rejected at a bunch of other places. The school that I'm now going to I hadn't visited at all until after I got in, and really had not known much about. This is probably more my fault because other than my first two choices I didn't really visit many colleges at all. Why I didn't is kind of a mystery to be, despite it being only like a little over a year ago. Part of it was depression about various things, and a also a bit of typical teenage ""everything (including college) is pointless"" type thinking. But regardless of why, I'm disappointed in how things turned out.<p>I know not everyone needs to build a website to get into [that school]. Other people did it via other merits, and maybe if instead of trying to be a programmer throughout high school, I had been more of an overall student, it would've worked out via a different avenue. Not that my grades were bad, they were pretty good, but I didn't have a whole lot of extra curriculars, and some of my SAT scores weren't great (probably because I didn't study much for them). Basically, I understand why colleges might've rejected me. On paper, there wasn't much else to me but grades and some decent scores. I think there's a lot more to me, but not much I can put on paper, because I can't finish things that I start.<p>I need help to stay motivated. What I might really need is a mentor, but I've never really met someone that I could say I really truly admired (maybe due to the narcissism). But what I need on a more immediate level is the ability to _keep_ passion. I can generate passion pretty easily, but it dies out. I need to know how to keep it. How to not become depressed and bored with things, and how to keep the wonder in stuff alive and keep myself in the ""engineer"" state of mind where I want to go crazy and keep building things and coming up with ideas.<p>Admittedly, some of my problems probably go beyond the scope of HN. I imagine I've got quite a bit of psychological problems, for example. But I'm not really looking for help with that (though if you want to offer it, go ahead). I'm looking for advice on how to stay inspired and motivated, how to be that person that goes out and works on all this cool stuff without having their interest wane.<p>Not sure if I've done a good job explaining myself but advice is welcome. :)",1312165022

In spite of the rhetoric being thrown around, the real debate is over how much government spending will increase. No plan under serious consideration cuts spending in the way you and I think about it. Instead, the cuts being discussed are illusory and are not cuts from current amounts being spent, but cuts in prospective spending increases.

That means that there can be no graceful decline; once an unknown tipping point is reached and it becomes clear that this is no longer the case, the advantages currently supporting everything that Americans take for granted will slip away in rapid succession.<p>So, yes, today, it is possible to treat foreign innovators and highly-skilled workers with disdain, to force them to jump through hoops and subject them to bizarre, dehumanizing visa processes, Hell, you can even force them to sit in boats off the coast of San Francisco ... but it is already true that the best and brightest are at least looking at what is available elsewhere, that countries like Singapore and Chile are waking up to the possibilities and I wonder how many more economic crises it will take before the proposition of dedicating your hard work and talent to a people that clearly hate you begins to look less attractive.<p>So, embrace this seemingly crazy notion and any other idea that routes around self-destructive tendencies of the American voter, do all you can to put tomorrow's breakthroughs as close as possible to American soil but, just remember ... we're going to need a bigger boat.",1312164574

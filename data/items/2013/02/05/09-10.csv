5169944,comment,5164287,5169901,1,0,darius42,,,"<i>>the result is that antidepression drugs do not work for the majority of patients.</i><p>I suspect that this is because most patients don't have the patience or wherewithal to try enough different kinds, or a doctor who is willing to combine them with benzos. The patient's patience is especially relevant since when you are depressed, the last thing in the world that you need is to add extra suffering from side-effects to your list of woes. Or at least that has been my personal experience. After a few bad experiences, I was very reluctant to try additional antidepressants, and after having become dependent on Ativan once, I vowed to never allow that to happen again either.<p>Ultimately though, I tried just about every modern antidepressant before finding one that worked, and I know people who had to go to tricyclics, which has caused them to become fat, but happy. Each of the antidepressants I tried affected me differently. But at this point, I am very relieved to know that if I become depressed again, there is a drug that I know for sure works for me. Knowing that is a <i>huge</i> weight off of my shoulders. Though having to look forward to weaning off of benzos again puts some of that weight back.<p>More recently I tried ketamine when I was worried that I was going to become depressed due to an unfortunate life circumstance. I'm here to say that it apparently worked as well as hyped since I never became at all depressed during a situation that would typically have sent me into a downward spiral. And with no ill side effects too boot. Too bad it's not legal....<p>Of course, trying many different antidepressants is not without its risks, as I alluded to previously.",1360058296

5169923,comment,5129530,5150654,1,0,draegtun,,,"Replying to myself because I want to add something interesting (to posterity) that I noticed today on Alioth:<p>Perl (or OS) was upgraded from 5.14.* to 5.16.2.  From cursory glance this gave all the Perl benchmarks a little boost.  For eg.  My fasta is about 3 secs quicker and the ""interesting alternative"" fasta dropped below 2.0 barrier (now timed at 1.96).<p>However on the summary Perl slowed down a few points (here's the new bottom five on u32 single-core benchmark):<p><pre><code>  Lua       31.09\n  PHP       40.49\n  Perl      54.90\n  Python 3  55.45\n  Ruby 1.9  62.40\n</code></pre>\nI think the drop is because the Perl <i>pldigits</i> benchmark is now failing.  The Math::GMP module can't be found.  Pretty sure this wasn't a core module so perhaps a Perl dependency has been removed in the OS (Debian).<p>PS. This maybe a temporary glitch so that dependency maybe restored soon.  If not then I may amend <i>pldigits</i> benchmark accordingly.<p>PPS.  I see that Python <i>pldigits</i> is using <i>gmpy</i> and is working fine.  This means that GMP is installed (as is <i>gmpy</i> Python library) so it's just the Math::GMP perl module that's missing :(",1360057655

Exceptions usually imply action across functions, but here they're just trying to enforce end-of-scope invariants.  So if you're writing C++ code with ""exception handling compiled out"" (such as with Embedded C++, if anyone still uses that) you can still leverage RAII to do a lot of that type of cleanup.<p>That said, ""goto"" gets a bad rap in my opinion.  Anyone can parrot Dijkstra's ""considered harmful"" line, but few know the context that it came from.  If you've seen large FORTRAN programs from that era, where ""GO TO"" was the main control flow choice and labels had to be integers you know how even simple algorithms could be made unreadable.  Effectively Dijkstra was extolling ALGOL programers not to code as if they were writing FORTRTAN -- in a structured language ""goto"" is the control structure you need to use least.<p>Still, there are places where ""goto"" is the cleanest way to accomplish what you want to do, and you shouldn't fear using it.  (Please pick a good name for the label though!)  I've seen programmers write crazy twisty code with all sorts of strange temporary variables simply to avoid the use of the forbidden ""goto"" keyword.  Clarity should be your aim, not religious purity.<p>Also remember that ""break;"" (except at the end of a switch case) ""continue;"" and even early ""return;"" are morally equivalent to the dreaded ""goto;"" when you think about it.

5169820,comment,5169507,5169507,18,0,jacques_chester,,,"I found it enlightening to learn about the context in which the GOTO was first ""considered harmful"" by Dijkstra in 1968[1].<p>This is a period of time when the concept of higher level languages with specialist if-then, loops and return statements were still relatively new.<p>Most programmers in the world had cut their teeth on assembly language. In that model the natural way to think of programs is as a sequential series of addresses in memory that contain instructions.<p>Since all control structures are merely jumps to a new address, so why were all those grumpy ivory tower idiots so keen on abolishing goto?<p>Probably the biggest blow to the pro-goto camp in those days was the discovery of the ""Structured Program Theorem"" in 1966. It was proved that any computable algorithm can expressed in any higher level language that has sequencing of instructions, ability to select an execution path and iteration. The ability to jump is <i>not</i> required. For the times it was an critical discovery because it meant higher level language designers could proceed with the confidence that any HLL they designed with those three properties would be usable for any algorithm in theory.<p>Finally, Dijkstra (and the other European greats like Hoare and Wirth) had in mind a particular vision of what programming ought to be. He didn't see it so much as an engineering activity. He wanted to treat programs as mathematical objects. Controlling the scope of languages can make this more or less tractable. So for example the ""one return from a function"" rule goes back to this vision, but has since gone on to live a care-free life of its own.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_T...</a>",1360055146

CA, NY, and MA have large urban populations, so more students are likely to attend those elite colleges.<p>That said, I know for a fact that admissions officers and student volunteers from these schools literally spend months driving around the country to recruit prospective students from traditionally underrepresented states. They are well aware of this perception of elitism and want to combat it. One of my good friends from MIT was from Montana. (Yeah, anecdotes != data, but this issue you mentioned is very legitimate and something that Top 10 universities are actively trying to address.)",1404752352

This could have unintended consequences like SEO guys suddenly demanding a public IP for their customer sites (many of which have no need for encryption I imagine) and causing a heavier IPv4 drain than expected.  IPv6 just isn&#x27;t here yet. Must be nice to be an SSL seller right now.<p>I find that if there is a https site, google will just send me there, which is nice, but if they&#x27;re changing their search algorithm for https that kinda sucks.  I want my search terms to match up with the best content, not used as a reward system for implementing SSL everywhere.<p>The article is pretty short on facts. I don&#x27;t think its favoring anything. It just uses SSL if you have it. On the downside, I have noticed that connecting to sites has been slower than usual lately. The SSL handshake is still slow.

She often changed just one word or tense and cleared things up, but now and then she&#x27;d can my headline entirely and rewrite it.<p>Today? Online news sites don&#x27;t care about headline accuracy, just SEO and linkbait rating.

Sure you can find a library in C++ for almost everything, but it is never as easy as &quot;pip install&quot; and subsequent import.\n* I do not have to declare types. It works well for small programs where I can maintain implicit typing in my head but becomes an impediment for larger programs.\n* Compilation time for any moderately sized C++ program and the lack of REPL quickly become a problem in fast iteration cycle. No IPython for C++.\n* Small syntactic sugar things always help. As an example, In Python I can assign array, set, or dict literal to any variable.

7999715,comment,7999486,7999486,17,0,api,,,"I ask this as a general question to all of tech culture, not to just this particular setting:<p>What about subtile elitism?<p>It&#x27;s one of the biggest subtile -isms I&#x27;ve run into. If you didn&#x27;t go to a top ten university, you&#x27;re sort of in a lower echelon in the tech world. In practice this subtilely selects for people from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and/or people who have an &quot;academic-oriented&quot; learning style as opposed to an autodidact or self-directed learning style. It also contributes to America&#x27;s regional class system... the top ten schools are by and large on the coasts. If you&#x27;re from, say, Kansas or Ohio you are less likely to attend one of them than if you&#x27;re from California or Massachusetts.<p>My impression for a long time has been that a significant chunk of the tech world is a top ten universities only club full of Stanford, MIT, Harvard, etc. graduates hiring, funding, and promoting other top university graduates. You could play a drinking game on sites like AngelList: take a shot every time someone lists &quot;attended MIT&quot; or &quot;graduated from Stanford&quot; as their <i>sole qualification</i> for being a founder or seeking a job.<p>Racism and sexism definitely exist, but from what I&#x27;ve seen socioeconomic elitism is the most powerful discriminatory -ism in the tech world. It&#x27;s not an either-or thing of course. It just adds yet another barrier that outsiders must overcome. Barriers are kind of additive... each barrier reinforces the other pre-existing barriers by adding another point of resistance.<p>I&#x27;ve got to admit that this is a personal gripe. I&#x27;m from the flyover country, and I&#x27;m also not an academic type. I hated school for the most part. I just don&#x27;t learn that way. But for some reason listing things like &quot;has single-handedly conceived, designed, implemented, and shipped the following products...&quot; or &quot;taught myself 6502 assembly language at the age of ten using only the appendix of the Commodore 64 extended manual&quot; just doesn&#x27;t carry the same weight as &quot;graduated from Stanford.&quot; Even if I could say &quot;graduated with honors from the University of Cincinnati,&quot; I doubt this would carry near as much oomph as &quot;attended MIT&quot; even if my grades at MIT were poor.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine being female or black/hispanic <i>and</i> not having the top ten degree. I feel like without &quot;MIT&quot; or &quot;Stanford&quot; I have to be twice as smart and work twice as hard. It feels like it&#x27;s exponential. If I were not white and male I&#x27;d have to work... what... sixteen times as hard?<p>Edit: HN won&#x27;t let me comment on this thread any more, so I&#x27;ll put my responses here:<p>Re: elite universities equalizing admissions: no, it doesn&#x27;t matter. There are 300+ million people in America and 7+ billion on Earth. Your odds of getting &quot;tapped&quot; by one of these kingmakers is vanishingly small regardless of how smart you are or how hard you work. Tweaking the selection bias of a tiny choke point does not change the overall size of that gate.<p>Re: the thread in general: whenever these kinds of threads come up, I find myself disagreeing with both the PC police and the hordes of right-wingers that materialize out of the ether. I really say a pox on both their houses. The wingers are hopelessly naive about the realities of discrimination. The PC police sort of have their hearts in the right place, but the problem is that PC stuff addresses the wrong causes. Women don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable to work in tech because of phrases like &quot;man up&quot; or &quot;hey guys.&quot; They find themselves excluded for more subtile reasons of cliquishness and in-group selection. These cliquish mechanisms are the same ones that give rise to top ten university bias, racial bias, cultural bias, etc. It&#x27;s a microcosmic manifestation of what on the larger social stage is called the &quot;old boy network.&quot; Playing language police is a lot easier than trying to <i>really</i> break up the cliques. The latter is incredibly difficult, as humans are tribal and cliquish by nature.<p>Still unable to post. I&#x27;m not going to forcefully assert some kind of soft-banning since as far as I know I&#x27;m being fooled by randomness, but I have noticed that &quot;you are posting too fast&quot; tends to appear in a way that seems uncorrelated to how fast I&#x27;m actually posting.

I think that&#x27;s an interesting POV on languages generally and it&#x27;s not totally at odds with the more everyday POV that languages are &quot;tools for creation&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a very concise way of putting it. My personal issue with a lot of what Harper writes is not that it&#x27;s technically wrong per se, but it only makes sense if one is discussing programming languages purely from first principles. Harper seems really taken aback by the popularity of Haskell compared to SML in the functional programming space, and yet can&#x27;t seem to wrap his head around the reason for the adoption is not so much about having ideal PL semantics but the fact Haskell has an industrial-strength cross-platform compiler with meaningful answers to modern problems ( FFI, concurrency, package management ). Haskell is rather unique in that it has a community that seems interested in building a language as both a &quot;means of expression&quot; and &quot;tools for creation&quot; and we&#x27;ve made some compromises between the two, no doubt. A lot of Harper&#x27;s comments ( and many PL theorists ) seem to completely casually gloss over the gritty compiler engineering as if it&#x27;s just beneath them, and that guys like SPJ and Simon Marlow are just wasting their time working on faster runtime systems and optimizations when he thinks they should be working on foundational &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; problems.",1404750479

These don&#x27;t describe facts, but rather knowledge, or your uncertainty. The wonderful thing is that they fulfill the same axioms as ordinary probabilities, and thus you can use Bayes theorem and so on with them.<p>Distinct from degrees of belief are probabilities (or frequencies in some Bayesian literature). These do not describe your uncertainty, but are really physical properties, or facts of reality, in disguise. If you have a fair die, P(1) = P(2) = ... = P(6) = 1/6, the equality of the numbers means that all faces have the same area (under the plausible assumption that the die has a uniform density). The area of a face is (for small deviations from P=1/6) proportional to the probability to land on that face. So a probability of P != 1/6 means you have a deviation from the perfect cube form.<p>One reason I think it is very important to be aware of this distinction is that people object to &quot;Bayesianism&quot; because most Bayesians don&#x27;t make the distinction. People do not reject Bayesianism because it&#x27;s methods don&#x27;t work, they reject it because it seems philosophically unsound. If they would stop calling plausibilities probabilities, a lot of discussion and confusion would go away IMHO.<p>(Maybe we should forgo all the p words and call the Bayesian quantity just &quot;awesome score&quot; or something. Less people would have problems with evaluating an arbitrary formula that doesn&#x27;t have all the philosophical and political connotations that probabilities have.)",1404748850

Having worked on sites where everything is an undocumented mess of manual multi-level includes with shared globals and half-baked implementations of things which already exist, in a better form, well tested and documented elsewhere, I feel like I need to shout from the rooftops <i>php has a package manager! f_ing use it! and url routers are a thing now!</i><p>It really is surpising how far you can get with a little effort now in PHP, and how much suffering you can avoid by just letting go (of what, admittedly, makes the language fun for some - it&#x27;s raw, ugly, stupid simple quick-and-dirty hackability) and embracing structure. And open source code.",1404748831

I have a background in design and writing, and when I choose to incorporate those disciplines into what I do with code, a lot of magic happens. Let&#x27;s say I order a class like a do a news article (upside down pyramid, aka most important shit first). Or I apply my own design eye to the motion or interactivity of a static design. Or even to how I interpret the structure of the code?<p>Reach out. Learn as much as you can. You end up finding a lot of relationships between a lot of things in life that can apply equally to each other. Right now I&#x27;m digging deep into car repair. It&#x27;s fun to find the correlations between the component systems of a car and software.",1404748816

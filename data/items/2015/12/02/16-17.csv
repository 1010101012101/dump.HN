At one point, after branching around for a while you hear a bird singing above.<p>If you say &#x27;climb the tree&#x27; you read &quot;You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.&quot;<p>If you &#x27;climb higher&#x27; you see &quot;On the branch is a small birds nest. &quot;<p>If you look in the nest, &quot;In the bird&#x27;s nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed. The egg appears extremely fragile.&quot;<p>If you open the egg roughly, &quot;There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg. It seems to have recently had a bad experience. The mountings for its jewel-like eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled. Through a cracked crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of intricate machinery. It is not clear what result winding it would have, as the mainspring appears sprung.&quot;<p>If you wind it, &quot;There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.&quot;<p>If you open the egg gently, &quot;The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera. \nFrom out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird. It perches on a limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing. As it does so, a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass. As the canary winds down, the song bird flies away.&quot;<p>When I found that as a 7 year old, sitting in the dark after everyone in my family had gone to bed, peering into the screen of my 286, I knew that text adventures are the only game worth making.",1449075433

Egress filtering doesn&#x27;t meaningfully help the network doing it and it may cause ugly problems with asymmetric routes and the like, so the number of networks that don&#x27;t do it is large enough to be meaningful. And if you get close enough to the core of the internet it&#x27;s basically impossible anyway because there is no practical way to keep track of which address ranges a particular interface should legitimately be sending traffic from when the list encompasses half the address ranges on the internet and can change at any time.<p>The upshot being it&#x27;s not at all difficult for an attacker to get hold of a connection that doesn&#x27;t do egress filtering, and that isn&#x27;t ever going to change.",1449075318

It is about racial oppression, plain and simple.<p>Be reminded that &quot;drug use&quot; is almost completely legal.  Of the tens of thousands of drugs in the contemporary pharmacopoeia, just a few are prohibited.  These were selected specifically (and openly) because of their traditional use among non-white people.<p>Everybody uses drugs.  Out of everybody, only poor people, and overwhelmingly poor people of color, suffer the effects of prohibition.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s only recently (in the past 30 or so years) that prohibition (the &quot;war on drugs&quot;) has even had a pretense of being race-neutral.  From 1914 until ~1970, drug laws were open discussed as a way to perform racial oppression.<p>> &quot;There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.&quot;<p>> “Reefer makes darkies think they&#x27;re as good as white men.&quot;<p>These are things that our current prohibition&#x27;s earliest champion, Harry Anslinger, appears to have said whilst holding national office as the chief of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.<p>So again: prohibition is not currently, and has never been, about drug use.  It is a policy enacted in a spirit of racism, with a racist intent, and per its design, continues the institution of racism.  It has no other goal.<p>No matter what other policy change may come to this land, if prohibition continues, racism will not have been defeated.",1449075255

10663991,comment,10663026,10663498,0,0,yolesaber,,,"Not sure what you are talking about with regards to no discernible movement replacing postmodernism - both New Sincerity and New Narrative authors and works have gained critical prominence as well as wider readership. Ben Lerner, whose works combine memoir, poetry, and fiction, was just awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. Knausgard&#x27;s memoir cum novel &quot;My Struggle&quot; is one of the biggest literary releases of the year.<p>From this, we can see that whereas postmodernism was concerned with the massive scope of societal and technological apparatuses which formulated our doxa (see: JR, Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow, White Noise etc), these movements have instead shifted their lens to the internal scope of the individual in face of a mind-boggling hyperconnected and networked world. How we come to construct a &#x27;self&#x27; in this environment and how that self is perpetuated have become increasingly popular themes. Poetry, interestingly enough, is actually at the forefront of incorporating technological themes into its practice. Scores of poets use autogenerated content or appropriate text from online sources or otherwise involve technology in their works.<p>Furthermore, it is not as though SV is some uncharted  territory ignored by the literati. Plenty of contemporary fiction authors have addressed SV and its &quot;tropes and heroes&quot; - Dave Eggers wrote &quot;The Circle&quot; and Pynchon himself dressed down the dotcom boom in &quot;Bleeding Edge&quot;, and those are just two of the highest-profile examples.<p>But I think the dearth of your SV literary movement is connected with the notion of your last paragraph. A literary movement borne out of SV culture to supplement these &quot;classics&quot; would probably be much like the SV blogosphere and tweet culture is today: a hollow echo-chamber filled with self-aggrandizing boasts, brags, and takedowns occurring within a delusional bubble where the ultimate focus is profit. There&#x27;s a reason the work in the article is pseudonymous. Great literature and the profit-motive of SV are antithetical. Most of the &quot;heroes&quot; in Silicon Valley don&#x27;t have the self-awareness to see how inane the business model of their unicorn is, let alone the perspective needed to write a truly great and meaningful work of literature.<p>Let&#x27;s be real: in thirty years we will be confronting the ugly face of the adverse effects emanating from this &#x27;movement&#x27; - massive income inequality, gross materialism and greed, the privileging of technological progress over human integrity, and endless surveillance (whether conducted by gov&#x27;t entities or private companies - pretty sure now that the metrics / data genie is out of the bottle it won&#x27;t be going back in).  So I doubt a literary movement will come from SV internally. Instead, I believe that the great works read by future audiences will be written by outsiders to address the fallout from SV&#x27;s &quot;tropes and heroes&quot;.",1449074645

And (hopefully by definition, since these are all just physical attributes), such correlations (as ridiculous as it sounds) should be no more, or less, important than racial, gender, age or other correlations. They&#x27;re all just tools to oppress minorities and treat people as groups rather than individuals, which is good for a single brain trying to make sense of the world <i>but bad for the individuals in the group</i>.<p>Are you aware of the blue eyes/brown eyes experiment by teacher Jane Elliott? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott</a><p>In any event, the problem, if any, is cultural and economic, NOT racial. I lived with a white Irish guy who grew up in an entirely black neighborhood, and if you closed your eyes you would have zero doubt he was black.

As soon as you learn of an unfortunate correlation with race (or sex... did you know almost all rapists are men? Did you know most people interested in math and science are male? Etc.), you tend to lean on it too much to make judgments across ALL of the correlate, and therein lies the serious problem, because the outliers get _the_shaft_. The well-meaning black man experiences bias on a daily basis and gets worse jobs, the science-interested woman gets scoffed at and thus discouraged by male teachers, and the good gentleman never gets the girl because she crosses the street before actually meeting him out of fear.<p>So, fucking quit it, man. It&#x27;s not helpful, in any way, shape, or form. It is disingenuous to all humans, to restrict a handful of them based on a correlation with a physical attribute. It&#x27;s giving in to the laziness of your brain trying to oversimplify a complex world.

An object is an object-oriented programming language&#x27;s model of an entity in the domain.<p>There&#x27;s why we disagree. I believe the DBMS&#x27;s model shouldn&#x27;t be conflated with the application&#x27;s model. Sometimes the row is an entity in the domain; however consider a normalised data structure, where the entity as the application understands it may span a couple of tables. Or involve data from another source.<p>My understanding is ORMs were originally developed to handle the mapping between domains, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mi...</a>.<p>DataMappers also shine when working against a legacy database or one that cannot be changed. But ActiveRecord is a heck of a lot simpler to work with.<p>> Modelling the domain should drive both application and database structure<p>I am luke-warm on this coupling; too often it leads to the application structured around the database representation, as you point out.  Sometimes this is sensible (e.g. a data-processing system), but in my experience it comes back to bite later on.<p>I&#x27;m interested to hear your experience - do your application models match the database structure?",1449073984

I found a new job quickly (networking, kids!) and once I found out my new start date I had a talk with my immediate manager and told him why I was leaving. I told him about the toxic culture. I told him about being made to feel stupid because I had tried to build process improvements which amounted to moving someone&#x27;s cheese a few millimeters. He understood, and was grateful. I told the HR person about the team dynamics. I told her that this toxic attitude towards change would continue to drive talented people like me out of the organization. She profusely thanked me and said that it had been the best exit interview she had ever had.<p>Fast forward 6 months on my new job, and I&#x27;m unhappy here for entirely different reasons.

If you don&#x27;t, you are missing an opportunity to practice the skill of having difficult conversations, and you&#x27;re short changing whomever comes into your job after you, who&#x27;ll have to have that conversation, too. Plus, your manager might surprise you. She/he might have a way to make you happy! Do start looking for a new job today.

We programmed like this on a television in a conference room for about 2-3 weeks as we bootstrapped the program from nothing into a working core of functionality and abstracted away from the experimental technologies into something more manageable that we could use day-to-day. From here we  split-off and worked in parallel and brought in the rest of the team - who had been maintaining the old product in the mean time.<p>The main benefits were that knowledge sharing was immediate as we all went through the same learning process and helped build the same abstractions. Problem solving was also incredibly quick. We eventually open-sourced the work and it has been actively used by others for about 3 years now.<p>Overall mob programming was useful, but I think only with the following constraints:\n- Small mob size\n- Limited time in &quot;mob&quot; mode\n- High-level of maturity and ability to work as a team among mob members<p>I think this could very easily turn into something nasty and unproductive with a group of people who can&#x27;t get along or aren&#x27;t mature enough for this level of cooperation and teamwork.",1449073418

My previous job the boss would go on verbal and physical tirades almost daily (cursing loud enough to be heard through multiple walls, throwing hardware, ripping a door off its hinges, etc).  Meanwhile, in one job, my mother had a boss made them work through a breakdown of the A/C. Their <i>office</i> temperatures were exceeding 100 degrees and most of the full-time staff were over 50 years old.  This ultimately led to that boss&#x27; death at her own desk.  Those are &quot;toxic environments&quot;.

I quit my first job shortly after I passed my probation - it was my first job out of university, and whilst the people weren&#x27;t toxic, the work was, and the commute was hell like I have never encountered before. Right after I passed my probation things actually got worse, because then (as is normal in the UK) I had a 1-month notice period. I needed money to start paying my student loans so I&#x27;d stuck with the awful job, but once the first 3 months were up, I fell into depression. It was an extremely bleak period in my life. I was able to pull my boss to one side and talked to him at great length about the work I was doing, that I didn&#x27;t feel I was contributing anything meaningful, that I was wasting my time in the job. He empathised, but there was little we could do to improve things. I looked at moving teams, but nothing appealed. We came to conclusion that the company and me were mutually incompatible. Shortly thereafter, I handed in my notice. I left at the 5-month mark.<p>About 6 months later, when I was feeling better, I interviewed for a job closer to home. When asked about why I was only at my first job for 5 months, I answered that I left for personal reasons. The matter wasn&#x27;t pushed, but I later felt like I&#x27;d blown it. Much to my surprise, I got an offer, and a good one. I&#x27;m still at this company 2 and a half years later.<p>My conclusion is that no job is ever worth staying in if you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re doing anything meaningful. If I&#x27;d tried to stick my first job for a full year, I would have topped myself. I couldn&#x27;t stand working like that. I discussed the faults of my old job with my new colleagues after I started here and they understood.<p>As long as you&#x27;re not hopping jobs every few months, you should be able to convince your interviewer it was a one-off. Don&#x27;t worry about trying to work a full year in a toxic environment. Move on if you need to.

There are a few things I would recommend discussing/negotiating before choosing to take the job.<p>Make sure that the company is going to provide you with the equipment, appropriate software licenses and such that you need to do your job (or salary for you to afford the expense). Consider things like upgrade frequency, office supplies and other factors that are normally a given in an in-the-office job.<p>Discuss communication expectations and work/life balance.  What communications tools does the team use? Are they appropriate for asynchronous communications or is the culture one of &quot;tap the guy on the shoulder&quot;?  There&#x27;s a sort of undercurrent of concern that rips through you when you&#x27;re a remote worker that might have you feeling like you have to work &quot;all the time&quot;, especially if your team is in a radically different time zone.  Prior to accepting the job I ensured that my performance would be based on meeting project deadlines with appropriate requirements to be in meetings when they&#x27;re scheduled (and none are scheduled at obscene hours of the night for me).  My biggest concern was that being the guy not in the office would equate a perception of being the guy who is just taking a vacation or goofing off (those who know me would laugh at that because I <i>love</i> the work I do, however, I tend to work a lot from a family vacation home, so the appearance was a concern of mine).  I write software and my most efficient times to work vary.  Knowing that often I can get 14 hours worth of normal work done in 6 hours if I target doing it at the right time, I wanted that flexibility to be baked into my work contract.  Provided my scheduling flexibility doesn&#x27;t block the rest of the team (it doesn&#x27;t due to unique circumstances of my job), or cause me to miss a deadline (it often results in me being early, instead), I&#x27;m free to work when I want and due to the added efficiency, that equates to hours/week of time that I get back.<p>The bottom line on that last point is be sure to have a very solid discussion on how your performance will be tracked.  Aim for the most objective measurements you can get, and ensure that you have substantial input in deciding deadlines.  There&#x27;s always external pressure on deadlines, but if you can&#x27;t be a prime component in that decision making process you run the risk of being given work that is not possible to complete on time, setting yourself up for failure.  If your discussion is dismissed or the answer is &quot;we&#x27;ll figure it out&quot;, beware.  Your manager is likely the kind who equates performance with &quot;butts in chairs&quot; and you will always be an empty chair.",1449072844

Not many pilots are willing to sit directly in the path of machine gun fire, even if it is not very accurate. German anti-aircraft figured this out as well. They switched to shooting mostly tracer rounds. You aren&#x27;t going to hit anything in the first place, so you might as well just scare the crap out of them.<p>Never really meant? Some citations there would be nice.<p>US day bombers that were not protected by fighters often suffered heavy losses against the Luftwaffe. Which is why unescorted daylight bombing was suspended following the 25% casualty raid on Schweinfurt.<p>>They switched to shooting mostly tracer rounds. \n..right. What I&#x27;ve read is that many units stopped using tracers altogether on pure fighters because their different ballistics at long range meant that they were not useful. The gas created when the base of the tracer burned diminished drag. (this has later been adopted for howitzer ammo, base bleed increases range by up to 30%)",1449072802

Unfortunately, it&#x27;s fairly difficult to keep all of this hidden due to the regulatory environment of the space industry and the wide open nature of &quot;space&quot;. You can&#x27;t really sneak out and back just staying low and below radar or benefit from the cover of darkness.",1449072321

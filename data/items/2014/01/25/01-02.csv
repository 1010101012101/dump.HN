My feeling is that if I keep asking myself how does this justify the cost then you didnt sell me on the value, you sold me on the feature set. I also think the value is probably working with organizations that are political in nature because they&#x27;ll want their base to use this.<p>Honestly, the design is fine.",1390611975

Nerve damage in both.  You know when you&#x27;re doing an EMG and it is supposed to raise up super fast and then drop down super fast in a very thin inverted V?  Well mine was a plateau of a couple inches wide, that&#x27;s how much nerve damage I had.<p>It&#x27;s been over 8 years since I&#x27;ve had a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome though.

My family was in printing, and I grew up with an appreciation of finely printed black ink on white paper. Seeing things move on such a crystal clear display, even if it was smaller than a piece of paper, seemed like the future. Even without color, I often preferred to mess around with my friend&#x27;s Mac (even with the limited entertainment software collection available at the time) than with their other computers.",1390611693

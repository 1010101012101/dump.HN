One of my potential co founders is a bit of a fanatic about XP but some facets of the process (especially the religious sloganeering and the use of tests to ""evolve"" the design  (""TDD"") ) seems counterintuitive. Also I am a bit concerned that the ""big names"" of Agile (with a couple of exceptions) don't seem to be hackers just process consultants and most of the experience they have seem to be in creating inhouse corporate software. <p>If anyone here has used XP or other Agile methodologies  (or even fragments from it like ""TDD"" for e.g) in their startup efforts, please take a moment to jot down your impressions.<p> How important is it to have the thefounders' coding ""philosophies"" mesh well?<p> Thanks in advance.",1182740062

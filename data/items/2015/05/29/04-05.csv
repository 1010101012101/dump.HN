If you&#x27;re going into biotech, for example, you can do just as well with a BS in Biology or Genetics and taking a few programming courses to give you an edge when it comes to areas that are using computers heavily (like Bioinformatics). The same goes for Physical Sciences, or Mathematics/Econ or even Geography.<p>Most CS Degrees cover:<p>1. Basic and Advanced Programming\n2. Design of Computer Systems (both hardware and software)\n3. Design of Operating Systems\n4. Theory of Computing (so Algorithms and Data Structures)\n5. Other special topics like Networking, AI, Expert Systems, Bioinformatics, etc.<p>These topics are important for some jobs, and people who excel in some of the advanced areas (and often go on for an MS) can make mega bucks. However, a programmer designing a corporate website or other CRUD system probably won&#x27;t need/use half of the stuff they learned in their degree, and would likely earn less than someone who excelled in another engineering/science degree that also picked up some programming knowledge.",1432875426

If you follow Basel II or III regulations, you will know how hard it has been for the regulators to convince the banks to increase their tier-1 capital. The banks are happy to pile on more debt rather than raise more equity capital (the purest form of capital) as debt is cheaper and comes with nice tax benefits. The financial crisis of 2008 was exacerbated because of leverage (another way of saying lots of debt).<p>While this can certainly reduce leverage in the banking sector, the author raises the question of start-ups vs. big companies. Big companies have massive balance sheets and will generally be able to borrow at much better rates whether or not there is tax incentive. If an up and coming start-up is amazing, I am sure there will be 100s of equity investors who will be willing to throw money at it. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about this impacting them.<p>That said, this will not fly in the US. So much for logical reasoning.",1432875318

9622730,comment,9621011,9621011,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Writing on a topic that I know next to nothing :-)  Hopefully it will provide entertainment if nothing else.<p>I have thought recently that consciousness, or any phenomenon that includes the awareness of the passage of time, is an illusion of memory.  Imagine that you have only an instantaneous existence.  Over time you move from one instance to another, changing state each time.  In essence\nyou are a state machine.<p>At any given instant, your new state depends on your current state and new inputs (not only are you a state machine, but you are a regular expression!).  Unlike a state machine with a fixed set of states and an infinite tape, you have a near infinite set of possible states and a finite tape.  The way the state is constructed, it is possible to reason about the likely path you took to reach your current state.  Of course, states you were in only a few iterations ago are easy to deduce while states that you were in a long time ago are much harder to deduce because there are many possible paths.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s imagine that you can partition your state.  In other words, you can take a small part of your state (call it a sub-state) and you can deduce past sub-states that you would have had to pass through in order to reach this sub-state.<p>With this in place, &quot;awareness&quot; could merely be the act of enumeration past possible sub-states.  So you can &quot;concentrate&quot; on a sub-state and at any given instant deduce the sub-states that have lead to this position.<p>Because your interface with reality would be the review of these possible past sub-states, it would appear from your point of view that there was a flow of occurrences that led to your current state.  But all of the information you are processing is internal and so your awareness would be dependent upon the instantaneous state only.<p>You could get very silly and imagine that if your movement between states was idempotent, that you could even execute the state machine out of order and it would <i>still</i> produce the same awareness of order and hence flow of time.<p>If this were to be the case (and I have no real reason to believe that it is -- it&#x27;s just an entertaining thought), I don&#x27;t think it would be as discrete as I describe it.  If you consider a neural network, it has a similar kind of state and a similar kind of &quot;memory&quot;.  Training the neural network creates outputs from inputs based on what had previously been input.  One might imagine a kind of network that could walk backwards through &quot;memorised&quot; patterns by feeding the outputs back into inputs, but I don&#x27;t think any such thing exists (and possibly it can&#x27;t exist). Aside: I know about convoluted networks, but I don&#x27;t think they produce the effect I am describing.<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s an interesting mental exercise, but not necessarily anything like what really happens.",1432874927

But a better way to look at it is as follows:<p>* Parallelism is a feature of the <i>algorithm</i>, chosen to make it run faster. E.g. you can use a parallel algorithm to factor a matrix. From a technical standpoint, the challenge of parallelism is how to deconstruct the problem so that each processing unit will be able to take on a share of the effort -- parallelism implies cooperation.<p>* Concurrency is a feature of the <i>problem</i>. E.g. many users using Facebook at once. If at any one time you have 10K requests, then your concurrency level is 10K, no matter how many cores are used. The challenge of concurrency is how to allocate computing resources among the competing requests -- concurrency implies competition.<p>Parallelism is orderly; concurrency is messy.

Readers have a read_counter that they maintain in their own context (not shared).<p>You&#x27;d probably have to declare this using the &#x27;volatile&#x27; keyword.

I would probably just wrap something generic using UNIX domain sockets up into a library and re-use that as needed.<p>Depending on your permissions requirements[1], and if you really only need a signaling flag, have you considered the filesystem? Just touch a file in a well-defined directory named after the event that happened, and poll it periodically. Removing the file clears the flag. Signals can coalesce, but you should never drop any. You can poll a directory (that will normally be empty) without much CPU load (the directory inode will be cached most of the time). You could setup a multiple listeners by giving them their own &quot;inbox&quot; directory, like. e.g.:<p><pre><code>    # send a notification\n    touch &quot;${HOME}/.${app_name}rc/messages/${destination}/${signal_flag_name}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nUsing the filesystem opens up the possibility of a message sender being anything that can generate - even indirectly - an open(O_CREAT). Your signals also persist across programs shutdowns and crashes - you can send and receive even when the other side isn&#x27;t running - and your state can persist across reboots. Also, you can leverage some of the guarantees provided by the kenel&#x27;s vfs layer. For example, rename(2) is atomic, so you can send small data payloads by writing to a different name first.<p><pre><code>    FLAG_PATH=&quot;${HOME}/.${app_name}rc/messages/${destination}/${signal_flag_name}&quot;\n    # using the PID ($$) to not collide with other message senders\n    TEMP_PATH=&quot;${FLAG_PATH}-new-$$&quot;\n    echo -e &quot;foo=bar\nbaz=quux\ncount=42&quot; > &quot;${TEMP_PATH}&quot;\n    mv &quot;${TEMP_PATH}&quot; &quot;${FLAG_PATH}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAs an optional linux-specific feature, you can extend that technique to be event-driven (no polling loop) by telling the kernel to notify you about file-create events by listening to the directory (NOT the file) with inotify(7) for the IN_CREATE messages. Those events can be received either in a simple blocking style by letting poll(2) wake-up your process. Alternatively, you can receive events in in a non-blocking style with poll(2) if you give inotify_init1(2) the IN_NONBLOCK flag. The man oage inotify(7) should have an example.<p>[1] this can get annoyingly complicated - but certainly not impossible - if you have to care about user/group permissions, esp. on the directory. Making a group specific to the message sending can help.",1432873656

We all know how integration works, so this becomes how we define inner products.<p>My professor&#x27;s point was to reverse the primacy there. We have a sense from vector operations of what inner products are; that can inform our intuition of what an integral is. That is, rather than saying &quot;I know how to do an integral so I can now take an inner product of two functions&quot;, say &quot;I have an intuition of what an inner product is, that is, the projection of one vector onto another to form a scalar, and that should inform my intuition of what an integral is&quot;.<p>The larger motivation for the whole talk was introducing Clifford algebras and the symmetry between dot product generalized to inner product opposed by outer product on the one hand, and cross product generalized to wedge product opposed by interior product on the other hand.<p>And, just to finish the mathjerking, the whole point of the course was to get to:<p>(δΩ)∫ω = (Ω)∫dω<p><i>ie</i>, the most general case of Stokes&#x27; theorem.

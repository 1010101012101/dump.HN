I think he&#x27;s right that there&#x27;s no good reason _not_ to use Python.<p>But I think he overstates the case.<p>Calling Python &quot;compiled&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem right -- he&#x27;s more right that this doesn&#x27;t matter, there&#x27;s no reason not to use something because it&#x27;s &quot;not compiled&quot;.<p>Calling Python&#x27;s typing &quot;strong typing&quot;, eh, really?  He provide a link to a wikipedia article on typing in general, how about a link to anyone else making the case that Python should be considered &#x27;strongly typed&#x27;, for a particular definition of &#x27;strongly typed&#x27;?   I&#x27;m dubious that it would be any definition of &#x27;strongly typed&#x27; that those who think they want it... want. Again, I think a better argument might be: So what, you don&#x27;t need strong typing for success, because of a b and c.<p>And the concurrency discussions is just silly. Sure, you can do _all sorts_ of things without multi-core concurrency, you may not need it or even benefit from it, and scaling to multi-process can sometimes work just fine too. But there are also _all sorts_ of cases where you do really want multi-core parallelism, and Python really doesn&#x27;t have it -- and trying to justify this as &quot;makes it much easier to use OS threads&quot; is just silly.  I guess it makes it &#x27;easier&#x27; in that it protects you from some but not all race conditions in fairly unpredictable ways -- but only by eliminating half the conceptual use cases for threads in the first place (still good for IO-bound work, no longer good for CPU-bound work).<p>I think there&#x27;s a reasonable argument to be made that Python will work just fine for &#x27;enterprise&#x27; work. There are also, surely, like for all languages/platforms, cases where it would be unsuitable.   By overstating the case with some half-truths and confusions, he just sounds like a fanboy and does not help  increase understanding or accurate decision-making -- or confidence in the Python community&#x27;s understanding!",1427205485

9256493,comment,9255468,9256117,0,0,padobson,,,"I have a number of questions that I&#x27;ve never been able to find satisfactory answers to, and if I got them I could be convinced.<p>But first, let me say, that this may well be moot. I think solar energy is the way to go. I think the sooner human beings stop burning things they find in the ground for energy, the better. I&#x27;ll happily give my vote or my money to an elegant solution to make this happen.<p>Next, my nutshell understanding of global warming:<p>Temperature and carbon-based greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are closely correlated. For as far back as we can measure (many millennia when using ice cores), atmospheric temperate has been stable along with CO2 concentrations (about 280ppm). Sometime in mid 18th century, CO2 concentrations started to uptick, which caused a rise in temperatures, which in turn caused a rise in CO2 concentrations, compounding continuously to present day  levels (1.5 degree temperature increase, ~400 ppm CO2 concentrations). The best explanation for the shift in the balance of the carbon cycle is the additional gases that humans add by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, and making concrete.<p>My questions:<p>1. Every carbon-temperature hockey stick chart I&#x27;ve seen starts in 1750, when humans were a negligible atmospheric carbon source. Even today, human beings are a minor source of carbon-based gases in the fast carbon cycle. While I can certainly accept that it would only take a minor addition to throw the whole system out of balance, the timing seems strange to me. How do we know that humans are responsible for the initial rise in CO2 concentrations above 280ppm that started 250 years ago when emissions paled in comparison to what they are today?<p>2. I&#x27;ve seen lots of charts that correlate greenhouse gas concentrations with temperature, but the charts I&#x27;ve seen (like this one: <a href=""http://bit.ly/18UFLMA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/18UFLMA</a>) that correlate greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions don&#x27;t seem to correlate as strongly until the blade of the hockey stick, and even then the correlation usually flips, with the proportion of human emissions surpassing the proportion of CO2 concentrations. If humans are directly responsible for present day greenhouse gas concentrations, shouldn&#x27;t emissions and CO2 concentrations more closely correlate? It seems like greenhouse gas concentrations don&#x27;t meaningfully rise until temperature meaningfully rises first as a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations.<p>3. Water vapor is a much more abundant greenhouse gas than any gases emitted by human activity. While I understand that other greenhouse gases simply have a higher capacity for trapping heat, what I don&#x27;t understand is how significantly humans could impact the greenhouse effect when they don&#x27;t substantially alter the most quantitatively significant greenhouse gas.<p>4. The most convincing argument for anthropomorphic climate change, to me, is the lack of a viable alternative. Solar forcing seems to be the best alternative offered. Do the climate models used to support anthropomorphic climate change account for variability in solar output? Is there variability in solar output? How is this measured?",1427204954

The majority of my experience with dynamic languages is probably in Python.<p>One thing that makes a difference between Python and other commonly used dynamic languages (here referring to JavaScript / ECMAScript and Lua) is that Python is dramatically more complex out of the box. This is both in terms of language features and Python&#x27;s batteries-included standard libraries.  For example, the amount of overloading that you can do in Python is very impressive, but the result is that common operations aren&#x27;t necessarily predictable or dependable without more context (not that this isn&#x27;t a problem in static languages - looking at you C++, but at least in the other languages you get type information to help out and some checking at compile time).",1427204944

#2 : &quot;Compiled&quot; is almost a meaningless word. The general definition of compiler is a program that transforms a document written in a source language into a document written in a destination language. TeX is compiler, a CSV to XML parser is a compiler.
As regards security/reverse engineering, Python and Java bytecode files can be very easily decompiled into the original program. It is  not the case for C/C++ and thus reverse-engineering is much more difficult. Anyway, this issue can be mitigated using obfuscation.
So ok for this myth.
#3 : Again speaking about the &quot;security&quot;. I don&#x27;t see why Python would be more &quot;secure&quot; than Java. I can see why it would be more secure than C/C++(runs on a virtual machine, so less buffer overflows, bounds checking etc.).<p>#5 : Yes very valid point for Python. And then you start comparing the JVM (a platform, a runtime, a virtual machine) with Python (a language). This is like comparing apple to oranges. And no, Java is not dynamically typed. Python is.<p>#6 : This is the wrongest point of your article. Python is slow, very slow. Excuse me, CPython, the runtime that virtually everyone uses is very slow (as all non-JIT virtual machines). Usually 5-10x slower than a native program and 2-4x slower than a JVM program. You can&#x27;t completely decorrelate the language and the platform. Speaking about Java performance means discussing the JVM (although Java can be compiled). Speaking about Python means discussing CPython.<p>Performance-wise, Jython is not much better (and sometimes a lot worse than) CPython, and they only implement Python 2.5. Pypy does an excellent job at optimizing Python and often yields on par performance with the JVM. However, it is incompatible with C extensions/modules written for CPython, which means it can rarely be used in production (goodbye databases etc.)<p>There are countless stories in HN of start up developers rewriting their systems from Python/Ruby to Java/Go because performance was an issue.<p>#7 : I think some of your examples are contrived (e.g. Youtube) as we don&#x27;t know where exacly where Python is used is the infrastructure. I only use Python to draw graphs does it mean my infrastructure relies on it ?<p>About GC pauses. Yeah, there are no pauses in Python because the GIL allows only one thread to run concurrently.<p>#8: The GIL is a performance optimization ? Really ? The GIL is here because it eased the development of the CPython VM but is terrible for performance. Because of the GIL a CPython cannot run more than one thread concurrently. In the era of multicore processors, this is terrible for performance. Yes, there are workarounds for <i>I/O operations</i> (greenlets etc.), but for processing intensive tasks, it is impossible to exploit a multicore processor with Python. And no multiprocessing is not a solution, as it does not allows to share memory between processes. Also remind that Python is often 4x slower than Java on a signle core...<p>#9: True but this looks like a strawman. Nobody ever said Python programmers are scarse.<p>#10: I am not having this debate again, but a strong type system is useful for big projects. I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s mandatory but it reduces development time.",1427204206

The bigger the project, the more places there are for runtime errors that a statically compiled language would have caught or at least has better tooling to find (syntax errors in an error path block that rarely gets hit, type errors, uncaught exceptions, missing methods, accidentally fat-fingering a variable name and instantiating a new variable). You end up leaning really heavily on tests that wouldn&#x27;t have to be written in other languages and documentation that would otherwise be statically enforced in many other languages.

9256372,comment,9256082,9256082,0,0,jerf,,,"This article overshoots. Yes, Python is slow, and yes, all four runtimes cited are slow. As I&#x27;ve said before, I no longer believe the idea that languages don&#x27;t have performance characteristics, only runtimes do, and as it happens, the decades-long efforts to speed up Python and their general failure to get much past 10-20x slower than C are a big part of why I believe that. NumPy being fast doesn&#x27;t make Python fast; it&#x27;s essentially a binding. A great binding that, if it meets your use case, means you can do great work in Python, but does nothing to help you if you don&#x27;t need that stuff.<p>As for PyPy&#x27;s &quot;faster than C&quot; performance, people <i>really really really</i> need to stop believing anything about a JIT running a single tight loop that exercises one f&#x27;ing line of code! Follow that link and tell me if your code even remotely resembles that code. In practice, PyPy is, I believe, &quot;faster than CPython&quot; with a <i>lot</i> of caveats still, but &quot;faster than CPython&quot; isn&#x27;t a very high bar.<p>(Similarly, though another topic, Javascript is not a &quot;fast language&quot;. People seem to believe this partially because of JIT demonstrations in which integers being summed in a tight loop runs at C speed. But this is <i>easy mode</i> for a JIT, the base level of functionality you expect from one, not proof that the whole language can be run at C speeds.)<p>There is no version of Python that will run you at anything like C or C++ or Java or Go or LuaJIT speeds on general code. It can&#x27;t; for one thing you have <i>no choice</i> but to write cache-incoherent code in Python, to say nothing of the numerous other problems preventing Python from going fast. (Copious hash lookups despite the various optimizations, excessive dynamicness requiring many things to be continuously looked up by the interpreter or verified by the JIT, etc.)<p>I&#x27;ve drilled down on this one, but there several other &quot;debunkings&quot; here that are equally questionable. Python does not have a &quot;great&quot; concurrency story... it has a collection of hacks of varying quality (some really quite good, though; gevent is <i>awesome</i>) that get your around various issues, at the cost of some other tradeoff. The definition of &quot;strongly typed&quot; that Python conforms to is almost useless, because everything is a &quot;strongly typed&quot; language by that definition. In practice, it&#x27;s a dynamically typed language, and yes, that can cause problems. Another collection of hacks are available to get around that, but they&#x27;re add-ons, which means the standard library and other libraries won&#x27;t use or support them. Yes, Python is a scripting language, it&#x27;s just that it turns out &quot;scripting languages&quot; are a great deal more powerful that was initially conceived.<p>Wow, I must hate Python, huh? Nope. It&#x27;s a <i>fantastic</i> language, certainly in my top 3, and still probably underutilized and underrespected despite its general acceptance. When I hear I get to work with it, I generally breath a sigh of relief! It is suitable for a wide variety of tasks and should certainly be in consideration for a wide variety of tasks you may have to solve.<p><i>But</i>, it is always <i>bad advocacy</i> to gloss over the problems a language has, and all languages have problems since no one language can solve all problems perfectly. If you are doing something really performance sensitive, stay away from Python. If you&#x27;ve got something highly concurrent, think twice... your problem needs to comfortably fit on one CPU using one of the existing solutions or there&#x27;s hardly any reason to prefer Python. (Yes, Python <i>can</i> sort of use more than one CPU but if you&#x27;re going to do that you&#x27;ll probably be happier elsewhere. &quot;Just throw lots of processors at the problem&quot; isn&#x27;t generally a good solution when you&#x27;re starting from a language that can easily be ~50-100x slower than the competition... that&#x27;s still an expensive answer, even today.) Yes, it is dynamically typed and there are situations where that is OK and situations where it is counterindicated. In the long term, you don&#x27;t help a language by trying to minimize the problems... you help by making it clear exactly what it is good for, when you should use it, and when you shouldn&#x27;t. Otherwise, you convince a hapless programmer to pick up your solution, pour a year or two into discovering it doesn&#x27;t actually do what you said it did, and now you&#x27;ve made an <i>enemy</i> for your language. Better for them to never pick it up because you truthfully told them it wasn&#x27;t suitable.<p>That said, though, be <i>sure</i> your task is performance sensitive before just writing Python off... modern machines are really hard to understand the performance of and most people&#x27;s intuitions are pretty bad nowadays. Dynamic typing has its problems, but so does static. Etc. etc. No easy answers, alas.",1427203629

In my mind, an A+ should be reserved for an SSL/TLS implementation that cannot reasonably be improved upon given the current state of the industry.<p>To improve your Key Exchange score you can bump your certificate from a 2048-bit key up to 4096-bit (giving you a score of 100).  That&#x27;s probably a good idea anyway as 2048 has been the minimum safe key size since 2010 [1], and I&#x27;d imagine that 4096 will become the new minimum over the next few years.<p>To improve your Cipher Suite score you can easily drop support for payload encryption with keys less than 256 bits in length.  You will risk not supporting IE 6 users, but that&#x27;s a fringe case these days (and there are many more issues with supporting IE 6 on top of that).<p>Making those adjustments, you should be able to get your scores to 100,95,100,100 which, in my opinion, is much more worthy of an A+.<p>There may be a few other tweaks you can make to improve items in the Protocol Details section, but I don&#x27;t know enough about the node.js/io.js system to be able to recommend a clear path for improvement there.<p>The only score that you really would have difficulty bumping to 100 is the Protocol Support which is limited by the fact that all versions of IE prior to 11 had TLS 1.1 and 1.2 disabled by default.

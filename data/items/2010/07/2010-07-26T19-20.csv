It is mostly a KV store with a metadata join, but it's +1.5 billion rows returning +10 random uncached rows in <100ms.<p>Originally we used MySQL, which revealed its true face at ~500 million rows. Queries that were <300ms suddenly turned into 2-3 minutes because the query planner decided it would be fun to do a full scan or somesuch. Migrating to PostgreSQL not only reduced the query time of the same queries by more than half but also allowed us to scale the number of rows pretty much linearly with a small constant.<p>Then I did some horizontal partitioning and things got really awesome.",1280174277

For example, if HW companies can do great customized chipsets, ala A4, for WP7 they may be able to get improved battery life.<p>Also, remember MS specifies minimum HW requirements, but vendors can go above and beyond (except in the case of screen resolution).  For example, there's nothing stopping one from adding front-facing cameras, with software supporting it.

The DMCA has a bunch of exceptions for things like ""interoperability"" and ""research"" that are somewhat vaguely defined, which someone who was subject to a DMCA suit could use as a defense. This rulemaking process carves out a subset of those where the Copyright Office has determined that the activity <i>definitely</i> falls under those exceptions. But unless I'm mistaken, I think it's possible to argue other uses as well--- but you'd have to argue in court why your use was primarily for interoperability purposes. The advantage of doing things that the Copyright Office already declared to fall under those exceptions is that you wouldn't have to argue that point at all, because the issue was already decided.",1280174022

Right now the way strains are rated is terrible and tells you nothing about what the effects are actually like. Usually the descriptions just say something like, ""uplifting and energetic"" or whatever. Meh. My criticisms would be:<p>1) Explain how the rating system works. It's not obvious just by looking at it that you only get five point to allocate within each category.<p>2) Consider bringing the rating system more in line with the academic research, specifically with the book On Being Stoned.<p><a href=""http://www.druglibrary.org/special/tart/tart8.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.druglibrary.org/special/tart/tart8.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.druglibrary.org/special/tart/tart11.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.druglibrary.org/special/tart/tart11.htm</a><p>There are several chapters worth of different effects, and since each strain is fairly consistent in its effects I think it makes sense to at least give users the chance to fill out a lengthier survey.<p>3) Bad design. Good design is supposed to remind you of something. This doesn't remind me of anything. Except maybe a generic web 2.0 looking site like OMGPOP. I'm not sure what the right look and feel is for a cannabis ratings guide, but I'm pretty sure this isn't yet. Maybe something that borrows inspiration from Zagats and Google Maps? You need a design that signals to a first time visitor that this is the authoritative site for this information, and this design doesn't send that signal at all.<p>4) If you want to start a marijuana-based web startup then you should make software for the dispensaries.

1549023,comment,1548321,1548321,0,0,jamwt,,,"While I think it's great that more and more developers are being exposed to building network applications using async I/O (which I guess is ""evented"" now) via Node.js, I think it's worthwhile to point out that the state of the art has moved well beyond these kind of callback frameworks.  The reason is simple: it sucks programming in callback patterns on serious, large projects.  You end up with lots of routines that are 6 or 7 callback chained together--and don't forget to attach error callbacks as well at each point.<p>In the Python world, for example, eventlet, gevent, and diesel (disclosure: my project) all use coroutines to achieve very high performance asynchronous I/O that's still written in a ""synchronous"" style.  And before that, CCP games has been using stackless python to do coroutine-based networking for the servers behind the very popular MMORPG eve online  (<a href=""http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/10044"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/10044</a>).<p>Even slicker, in languages like Erlang and Haskell (via forkIO + the select/epoll I/O manager), support for asynchronous networking using ""blocking-style"" code is a fundamental language/compiler/vm feature.  When you write <i>any</i> code in these languages, you're transparently taking advantage of the same scaling characteristics node.js and its ilk provide.<p>So, I'd humbly suggest to anyone getting serious about doing this kind of programming that they investigate some of these systems (which are usually built by weary callback-style async I/O veterans) and leapfrog the rest of their peers.  Consider Node.js a gateway drug.<p>Linkage:<p><a href=""http://eventlet.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eventlet.net/</a>

They did this with the expectation that you would in turn pay for the following generation.<p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that you should be forced to perpetuate the system. You didn't choose where you were born, and if you think the system in place there is wrong you should be free to leave.  But you've benefited from the generosity of others, and now by moving to a country where it's cheaper to do business precisely because it doesn't offer its people the same advantages that Germany does, you're ducking out of repaying that debt.

It's a vector tool, but the web is still a pixel medium.<p>For me: Photoshop for manipulating photos, Illustrator for illustration, Fireworks for web/application layouts (although it can handle some basic photo editing and illustrating, which makes it even better for layouts).",1280171524

At that point most people shift from ""maximize enjoyment"" mode, where paying more for something better is more rational, to ""minimize costs mode.""  If I'm going to spend 5 hours being uncomfortable whether I spend $300 or $500, what's the point in paying more?<p>I think there's a certain enjoyment threshold below which something becomes ""unpleasant,"" and moving from one state below that threshold to another state also below that threshold isn't as valuable as a similar state shift would be if the initial state happened to be above that threshold.",1280171479

Having two is even better when you have a choice on which one feels more comfortable to use and is more suited for your project. Having 25 libraries that do basically the same thing gives diminishing returns because the community is split over which one is better and easier to use, while the majority won't be full featured and with a larger number of bugs overall.<p>This is not necessarily a black and white scenario that holds true to everything, however.

It's also a bit unnerving because it's split between men and women because there are no clothes allowed and for me, I was alone with a very limited grasp of the language. People were really nice and mostly curious about me and how I knew about onsen's (seemed like a big secret to me at the time).<p>If/when I go back to Japan I would actually make it the entire reason for the trip; aka, travelling around from one onsen to the next.",1280170903

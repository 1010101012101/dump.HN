2063725,comment,2063083,2063405,0,0,sudont,,,">  <i>They think (incorrectly) that whatever they themselves ""like"" will also be liked by other people.</i><p>This stems from kindergarten, really. This is where we start telling children that everyone's aesthetic opinions are correct. When anybody complains, the standard answer is ""hey, that's his opinion, and it's just as valid as yours."" A designer is taught the basics of universal aesthetics, and this quote: “Don’t try to be original, just try to be good.”<p>However, there exist things such as the golden measure, which are inherently more attractive, measurably and proven, to humans. This is why gothic architecture seems so alien, and why their paintings are messed up... their definition of proper proportion was incorrect. They felt the human body was an ugly vessel for the soul, and that churches should reach to God. It took us a while to realize that neo-classical Greek architecture and sculpting was inherently correct, that things need to be based on Φ to be human.<p>Look at a Macbook Pro. It's beautiful. I know a few Windows developers who <i>HATE</i> the mac operating system, but run a MBP because the hardware is so nice, so good looking. This is in contrast to the personal preference of some fantasy lover who decks a computer out with skulls and blue lights. There is a human style that is universal, but often clouded by personal and cultural preferences. Our things are based on our proportions: the traditional musical scale is based on pitch segments of what the human voice is capable of. Because of this common design thread, there are solutions that are more inherently correct and pleasing than others. You don't ever hear an engineer complain about mathematical beauty.<p>The reason most people don't say anything about design? They don't have words for it, and without those words they can't understand a concept. I've taught friends about typography and they suddenly start to develop a design aesthetic, much like your photography skills. This is fairly similar to a culture with no concept of higher numbers: one, two, many.<p>Start here: <a href=""http://moma.org/explore/collection/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moma.org/explore/collection/index</a>",1294073694

Of course, on many normal, non-malicious patterns, the matcher is simply fast and memory efficient.<p>That matcher also supports matching text that is not contiguous in memory.

2063658,comment,2062134,2063344,0,0,kragen,,,"Yeah, I was thinking of the 30-60 year timescale. The higher P/Es you're talking about are either the result of suckers or the result of expectations of continued substantial growth over the next decade or three. The historical average is brought <i>up</i> by companies like Apple and Oracle.<p>Long-run stable P/Es could rise if the internal rate of return of the economy as a whole fell, so that a good safe investment was one that paid 2% instead of 4% after inflation. That could happen under circumstances like these:<p>- If the peak-oil doomers turned out to be right, and our economic growth actually does turn out to be contingent on continually increasing fossil-fuel consumption; or<p>- If much of what we think of today as ""profit"" was actually destructive extraction of natural resources (e.g. overfishing); or<p>- If some kind of sustained disaster makes profitability difficult (e.g. the aftermath of global thermonuclear war, widespread coastal flooding destroying coastal cities, widespread Farmville addiction, or the gradual collapse of the Westphalian state system in the face of decentralized guerrilla warfare); or<p>- If we shift to a less efficient way of allocating productive resources than transparent capital markets, to an even greater extent than currently (e.g. war and other forms of theft, taxation for the benefit of wealthy bankers, insider trading, central government planning for the benefit of the politically well-connected).<p>I consider these scenarios unlikely.<p>If, by contrast, we keep inventing and putting into practice ways to produce more and more value for less and less effort and natural resources, and knowhow becomes more easily accessible rather than less, then we can expect that the internal rate of return that stocks must compete with in order to get investment dollars will go <i>up</i>.  Which means long-run P/E ratios will go <i>down</i>.<p>To make this concrete, suppose that in 2029, you have US$20 000 to invest. (I'm speaking in 2011 dollars here to avoid talking about inflation.)<p>In 2029, Apple has settled down to a share price of $100 with annual earnings of about $10 per share (a P/E of 10:1), and no particular expectation that that is more likely to go either up or down in the next few years.  So you could buy 200 shares of Apple and get about $2000 a year out of it, with some risk that Intellectual Ventures Hummer Winblad will get greedy and sue Apple into bankruptcy two years from now.<p>Alternatively, you can buy solar panels and sell the power back to the grid at the going wholesale rate of $0.015/kWh. In 2029, silicon solar panels have finally been edged out of the market by quantum-dot solar panels, which have an energy payback time of 3 months in a sunny climate.  Like silicon solar panels, they're made out of some of the most abundant materials on the planet, and their fabrication is fully automatic, so essentially all of their cost is profit, the cost of the risk capital invested in their manufacture, and the energy dissipated in their manufacture.  The energy dissipated is $0.033 per average watt, $0.011 per peak watt, but because of the large investments involved and the rapid expansion of solar panel manufacturing, that's only 10% of the actual purchase price of $0.11 per peak watt.<p>So instead of buying the Apple stock, you can buy 180 peak kilowatts of solar panels, which will generate 60 kilowatts, averaged over day and night, winter and summer.  Instead of earning you $2000 per year, this will earn you $7900 per year, and your only risks are that energy prices fall further or someone steals your solar panels.<p>Since your objective in this investment is to make money, you buy the solar panels, as does everybody else.  People sell their Apple shares in order to carpet the Gobi with solar panels. Consequently Apple's share price falls.  Eventually it reaches US$25 per share, at which point its P/E is 2.5:1, and it's competitive with the solar panels again.<p>As long as there are investments available with rates of return similar to those I've postulated for solar panels above, shares will tend toward that 2.5:1 P/E ratio.  They aren't doing it now because there are only very limited investments available with such high rates of return: installing a more efficient furnace in your house, maybe, but how many houses do you have?  Solar panels, though, and thorium extraction from seawater, and automating custom manufacturing --- those are <i>scalable</i> investments.",1294072868

Simplicity should always be the end goal but this should not be at the expense of features!! There seems to be a certain mindset where people believe that minimal, or simple interface design is the 'easy' option. It is not, it's often the opposite. Good design ensures an end result always feels AND looks simple to use for the end user. The features added to a service should never be considered, or be resolved in a way where they could be described as 'clutter', as you label it. I'd consider that a fail if I looked at a new feature that way.

What folks are finding is that the bad neighborhoods are on the rise, at least when it comes to short, popular searches. Now it appears the screen scrapers are busy at work targeting tech questions. In the last couple of months, when I had a technical question I got total junk for an answer -- lists of questions that took me to landing pages, re-dos of Stack Overflow pages, and random questions that didn't even have answers.<p>I use Google extensively for search. About once a month or so, I'll be looking for something in a bad neighborhood. It's not a pleasant experience. It's a shame to see tech questions end up like this.<p>But the problem, as another poster pointed out, is that nothing is for free. You are either paying money, in which case you are the customer, or you are the product. There's no ""in-between"" In Google's business model you are the product.<p>I think the business model can continue for a good, long time, but there is always going to be cross-incentives between people who want free stuff and providers who have to pay money to provide you with stuff. Not everybody can be a wikipedia and raise money with pictures of Jimmy Wales. They are an outlier.<p>My conclusion is that these are browser problems. After all, it's none of my business what people put on the web, and aside from liking Google and wishing them well, I really don't have a dog in the fight for their struggle. In fact, it's better for me to have a dozen search companies all using different algorithms -- makes it harder to game the system.<p>So what I want is a browser. A browser that uses multiple search engines automatically and completely eliminates any ""fluff"" from rendered pages -- perhaps even combining various pages into much simpler displays.<p>I'd pay for that, and that would make me the customer. Then I would have whatever web experience I desired, instead of the one that I get for free.

All the actual encryption would be handled by the IP stack and offloaded to hardware, while the application-layer TLS bits would be used once at startup (and maybe subsequently if the lower layer re-keys) then get out of the way.<p>Key and cipher negotiation could easily be shoehorned into the three-way-handshake already used to establish connections.

With TCP you could even just use the sequence number as the counter, although this would be harder at the IP layer.<p>But yeah, none of this would have been available at the time.

2063518,comment,2062889,2063216,0,0,jerf,,,"Ah, you just have to do it differently. You can't approach an enterprise problem with ""real math""; real math is usually pretty brittle in practice, in the sense that the way the axiomatic systems tend to get set up you can ram the slightest deviation from them through to prove anything, thus breaking the system wide open. Practical programming does need to be more robust than that. Even Haskell requires unsafePerformIO and while end users should not use it, some important libraries certainly do. Even algorithms work tends to be not very useful.<p>On the other hand, the way in which you think of mathematical entities can be very important and useful, particularly in thinking of things in terms of constraints and preconditions and the resulting guarantees the code can make. Again, not in a flat-out ""code proof"" sense, but as a way of approaching the code. This has allowed me to write some surprisingly capable code in a multi-team setting by carefully considering the minimal requirements I can impose on the other teams to get a desired result, then making sure I enforce those requirements carefully (since I am in a language where I can't do it with a type system), and then on those basic promises build another layer of the system that is the thing I am actually working on. If I came at this with a hacky hacky chop chop approach it would <i>fail</i>... just as the previous effort did, ahem.<p>Also, in programming as in math, a thing <i>is</i> what it <i>does</i>, profoundly. This can take a long time to come to grips with. A typical programming entity ""is"" quite a bit more than your typical math entity, though, for better and for worse.<p>Preconditions, postconditions, and constraints also make great testing fodder, by which I mean, they make great <i>practical</i> testing fodder. Writing code in practice is a lot easier if you have some assurance that those things are actually true.<p>I don't necessarily even sit down and sketch this all out, again, because being too rigid causes your rigid assumptions to break, but this stuff is always in the back of my head, and it will get you quite far once you master it....<p>... and I say that in general. edw519 I wouldn't care to second guess how you're doing things at this point. :)",1294070853

I wouldn't trust it for anything critical, (which ""waking up on time"" isn't) but then again, I wouldn't trust any single alarm.<p>In response to the guy behind you: I did some googling for high-reliability alarm clocks, and didn't find anything relevant. Designing one would be amusing, in the standard vein of engineering humor. (Ha ha, isn't this horribly over-designed.) Redundant power supplies! Integral UPS! Three rad-hard microcontrollers which vote on the correct time! Two displays, in case a LED segment on one fails, and gives you the impression of the wrong time! Costs $5000, and weighs 40 pounds!",1294070542

Since I'm going in that direction, I decided to use a microframework to have the most control over the programming, so I went with Flask (this isn't specific to Flask, however).<p>After coding a bit, it feels like I'm always reinventing things that Django already has. I'm pretty sure that this is because I have years of development with Django under my belt, but the mere fact that I have to basically write my own framework is alarming.<p>I know that Django on GAE has a few problems (mainly that the ORM is not designed for it), but I hear that the django-nonrel people have done a good job porting it.<p>What are your experiences with microframeworks, on or off GAE? Has anyone used Django on GAE? Is it worth giving up on all the batteries that Django provides, and what do you gain?",1294070535

In order to make this seem absurd, Taubes never mentions the first 7 strips of bacon.<p>Whether or not I agree with (1) depends on how low we set the threshold for what matters. If we care about the difference between ""six pack"" and ""thin but no six pack"", we care about the first half strip of bacon. (Fun fact: bodybuilders and boxers do stress about 20 cals/day.) For the purposes of Taubes example (thin 50 year old vs obese 50 year old), mainstream nutrition and calorie counting says 20 extra calories doesn't matter.<p><i>When I said precision, I don't mean 20 cals leads to 40 pounds. I mean the precision of someone eating an average calorie count with a margin of error so small. Consider the other side of that - for me to have maintained my own weight for the last 20 years, I would have to have been extremely precise in my eating, which I'm sure I wasn't.</i><p>It's exceedingly unlikely that you maintained your weight with a margin of error of 2lbs - my <i>daily</i> variation can be as large as 6-7lbs. I'm also fairly ""stable"" in my weight - it never leaves [215,230] (unfortunately I'm a hard gainer).<p>Further, if you want to stay roughly stable in weight, the target is not your maintenance needs. If you instead target the maintenance needs of <i>a person of ideal weight</i> (rather than a person of your weight), you don't need much precision at all to avoid becoming overweight. If you are off by 100 cals, you might be 5lbs too heavy, but you won't get anywhere near 40lbs - your maintenance needs will increase and consume the excess.",1294070534

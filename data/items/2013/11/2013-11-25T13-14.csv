Many GIS products are licensed per country for this very reason.<p>- In the US, zip codes are the most terrible type of geography to use for any meaningful analysis, as they are constantly changing and do not actually have defined borders. Zip codes are basically just labels that get appended to street segments.<p>- If you look in the back of the ~200 page pdf that comes with most digital geographic data, you will find an appendix. 99% of the appendix is a section typically called &quot;disputed territories&quot;, and 99% of the disputed territories are China claiming to own another nation.

There is a HN blindness to this because it takes a programmer a couple months to get up to speed so managing Ruby programmers this way would be pretty idiotic, but for low skill jobs where actual training is about a day, getting rid of them before they get too expensive is a &quot;valid&quot; although inhumane management technique.<p>My gut level guess is something like they don&#x27;t pay benefits of any sort for the first 90 days, so management goals and bonuses are oriented around making people so uncomfortable that almost all of them are gone by 89 days.",1385387749

Fred came on board as Chief Architect, and focused on supporting the organisational move from traditional enterprise technology team to a nimbler, highly skilled organisation built around a strong culture of personal responsibility and trust.<p>I think all the other details in this write-up are not as important as this. The specific tech choice isn&#x27;t the driver, it is this cultural shift. This doesn&#x27;t mean the tech choice doesn&#x27;t matter though. In fact, I would argue that the most rapid way to build such a culture in your organization is to self-select for people who would do well in that environment. I hate painting people with too broad a brush, but my experience has been that choosing safe, established technologies as your stack will cause the sort of people who like safe, predictable work to show up for jobs. It can be hard (though certainly not impossible) to recruit the alpha geeks and the people with a more entrepreneurial perspective. There are plenty of super-talented people who have very pedestrian technologies as their preferred platforms. But if you&#x27;re looking to mix things up quickly and go for a more nontraditional environment, the shortcut to getting that is to choose tech that is beloved by people who primarily want to work in a nontraditional manner. The sort of person who dabbles with go or node in their spare time does it not because they expect that it&#x27;s going to be their meal ticket to a cushy job doing software development at a bank somewhere. They do it because they have got intrinsic motivation to learn new things and be on the cusp of the latest tech out of sheer enjoyment.",1385387217

I worked cruddy jobs while I was in school, and I didn&#x27;t mind running a floor buffing machine at 2am because I knew it was probably one of the worst jobs I&#x27;ll ever have, and its just for a little while.  I would imagine the emotions are quite a bit different if you fully realize a cruddy job is the best job you&#x27;ll ever get yet its still awful and there is utterly no chance of advancement (better off buying lotto tickets).  This is also reminiscent of my experiences in the .mil, where spending my whole life doing that kind of stuff would have been pretty awful, but doing it as a kid for fun was OK.",1385386947

I think it&#x27;s comparable to what Microsoft has shown on the Surface. So far it&#x27;s pretty static, which means instead of dragging pictures into zones to tag them I just select them by clicking on them and then open a dialog. Pretty easy to do, pretty useless for large amounts of images. Using the DOM and a framework everything is cut out to solve this problem.<p>Problem is, it is too slow and too rigid. I wanted to add selection by drawing a box, or even a polygon with a pen. To my understanding this is both possible in Canvas and WebGL, but neither allow me to use the DOM or frameworks build on top. There are frameworks which make the Canvas more accessible, but they are all targeted at making games and basically no interaction which is made easy with DOM + JS is implemented.<p>Is this a gap in the world of JS no one has yet filled? The only remotely active framework that promises more than just game development is KineticJS.

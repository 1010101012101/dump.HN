For example, some big accounting/finance firms only hire ""top MBAs"". No amount of garage-startup experience is going to get you in there; remember that not every educational/experiential endeavor can/should be viewed via the ""Is this good for a startup?"" lens.

4905363,comment,4902963,4903590,4,0,Spooky23,,,"If real estate development was a free market, and a true commodity, then I would agree with you. The problem is, it isn't either thing.<p>The tax rules associated with large construction projects, plus that fact that large-scale commercial real estate is a cartel in most US markets means that the actual impact in terms of units doesn't equate to the number of units built. That's one reason why you see economic behavior that doesn't make sense on the surface -- prime urban residental property left vacant or rented out as tenament housing and big commercial properties left vacant for years.<p>Generally speaking, today, new residential construction in urban areas is pushing affordability out to the periphery of the city, or the aging out ring of suburb outside of the city.<p>Another issue is that location matters, and we tend to stick to desirable places in a limited area. Few people want to uproot their kids from school every few years or move away from their families and social networks. So the fact that a 3 bedroom ranch in Minneapolis costs 60% less than a 1 bedroom apartment in Queens doesn't really matter.<p>I'd suggest you read the sections in Robert Caro's ""The Power Broker"" see how these kinds of shifts impacted millions of people in NYC during the 50s and 60s.",1355245151

The problem is that Kim Schmitz and his team did things, including paying contributors to upload copyrighted material, that forfeited their protections. Prosecutors didn't make this stuff up; the requirements for claiming service provider protections are right there in the law. The prosecution has Schmitz and associates <i>in their own words</i> conspiring to break the law; they left it all in plaintext email.<p>This is one of the most virulent misconceptions about copyright law on HN. The DMCA does not say that you are protected as long as you honor takedown notices. In addition to honoring them, you must not have any specific knowledge of infringing use of your service that you fail to act on. If any idiot can hit the front page of your site and see that it's used mostly for piracy, law enforcement will take an interest in you once you get big. If, during discovery, they find email messages showing you conspiring to keep copyrighted material on your site, they'll charge you criminally.",1355245067

If a suit by Northwestern to enforce the patent would be legitimate, why not a suit by anyone else who bought the patent?<p>The point is that ""using the property in your business"" is not a requirement for legitimately enforcing property rights when it comes to any other kind of property. The right to use property productively is part of the ""bundle of sticks"" that defines a property right, but so is the right to sue for infringement of that property. Splitting up those individual rights and selling them and buying them individually, these are all just part of how property rights work.<p>The whole point of treating inventions as property is to allow inventors, like Northwestern, to monetize their inventions in the same ways they might monetize a piece of land. They can build something on it, sell it to someone else to build something on it, or even sell it to someone who does nothing with it but sues people who trespass on it. Usually people don't do the latter with land, but the nature of land makes for very different enforcement than the intellectual property.<p>Again, this is completely orthogonal to what you might think the scope of patent rights should be. Maybe we shouldn't treat them as property. Maybe they should go into the public domain immediately. That's all plausible. But we do treat them as property, and lawsuits are just one of the ways of monetizing property.",1355244344

4905086,comment,4903247,4904095,1,0,afuchs,,,"The OP's article describes a Swedish school's overreaction to gender bias by forcing behaviour modification on students who display gender-conforming behaviour. This is an overreaction to gender bias issues both real and perceived. Ignoring the context presented by the article, emmapersky is advocating gender neutrality. They aren't advocating the forced minimization of gender differences; they want to end bias against those who display gender-variant behaviour.<p>Gender bias is present in our society along with the pressure to conform to gender stereotypes. Boys who play with dolls are often bullied by other boys and are socially rejected by their peers. Girls who don't dress the right way are bullied by other girls and are also socially rejected by their peers. In adult life, men who chose careers such as nursing are chastised for it by members of both genders. Women who chose professional careers are pressured forgo their careers to have children, again, by the members of both genders. To those who take gender-variant roles, this is a problem.<p>While there is a problem, some overreact to it trying to treat gender-conforming behaviour as a disease; as this example in the article:<p><pre><code>  Hunter College psychologist Virginia Valian, a strong\n  proponent of Swedish-style re-genderization, wrote in the\n  book Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women, ""We do not\n  accept biology as destiny ... We vaccinate, we inoculate,\n  we medicate... I propose we adopt the same attitude toward\n  biological sex differences.""\n</code></pre>\nThat is not a reasonable solution. Gender-variant behaviour should be tolerated instead of being discouraged. The article's conclusion agrees:<p><pre><code>  There was a time when a boy who displayed a persistent\n  aversion to trucks and rough play and a fixation on frilly\n  dolls or princess paraphernalia would have been considered\n  a candidate for behavior modification therapy. Today, most\n  experts encourage tolerance, understanding, and\n  acceptance: just leave him alone and let him play as he\n  wants. The Swedes should extend the same tolerant\n  understanding to the gender identity and preferences of\n  the vast majority of children.\n</code></pre>\nPostscript: Anyone engaged in the debate of gender bias and gender stereotypes should be aware of both their own and other's social biases[1].<p>[1] <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_decision_making#Social_biases&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_...</a>;",1355242341

4905083,comment,4893452,4900455,1,0,dalke,,,"This is getting too close to describing how making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs is meaningful.<p>The introduction is quite clear that the mathematics is understandable by other mathematicians. The commentary from the Encyclopedia Galactica (116th edition, published about 1020 years after Sheldon's death) describes ""Seldon found the field little more than a set of vague axioms; he left it a profound statistical science."" Gaal, by the end of a day of collaboration, was able to accept that its predictions were valid. It's hard to imagine that Seldon managed to hide the uncertainties in his work, given that others would be looking for precisely those uncertainties.<p>The justification in the series was that need drove development of micro atomic power units. Terminus is described as a metal-poor planet which needs to import just about everything. (Which then makes me wonder how there's enough minerals in the soil to provide the food needed for humans to survive. Do they even import the zinc needed to prevent zinc deficiency?)<p>But atomics weren't the only power source. Trantor uses only geothermal power because it's cheaper than atomics. So it isn't like there's a complete power monopoly. In addition, the personal shield would be quite the coup. Given ""the known probability of Imperial assassination"", there's a strong inventive for the Emperor and others to push for a personal shield, and a matching power source.<p>So you have the strange case where out of the million inhabited planets, only one retained atomic power and the rest fell into ""barbarism."" 200 years in the new era, fully 1/4 of the population was no longer under Imperial control, and yet all the rest of the people stopped understanding how nuclear power worked. That speaks to a very rote-based education system. But then how did the people of Terminus manage to not only remember it but advance on it?<p>It just doesn't make sense. Of course, in book it's all a fraud. The Second Foundation, full of psychics, and of course the robots, are working behind the scenes to keep everything on track. I think that's a cop-out, and I found it very hard to accept the later books in the series.<p>And of course in real life it's a SF version of the fall of the Roman Empire, and as that's the history that we (as Western readers) know best, the parallels feel comfortable. Had it been based on the Incan or Mongol empires, there would be a completely different sense of inevitability.",1355242316

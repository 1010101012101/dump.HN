Only the majority of them.<p>I believe I read that stores don&#x27;t encourage self-checkouts very much because having humans around significantly decreases shoplifting. This may be less necessary if we get better AIs for monitoring security cameras.<p>I&#x27;ve never read anything about self-driving cars being impossible in bad weather, only that no has done it yet. Machine vision systems are not as vulnerable to this btw and that has been improving in leaps and bounds over just the last 10 years.<p>Lawyers still searched through documents tediously before computers. It was probably even harder then, not easier.<p>It&#x27;s at least theoretically possible create a robot that can diagnose and prescribe treatments for a patient just like a doctor. All the video claimed is that they can do statistics and search the relevant research a lot better. Which is definitely true, and see IBM&#x27;s Watson.<p>Arguments about what &quot;creativity&quot; means are never useful or productive. But AI that generates music well already exists and is going to continuously get better.",1408161595

People with technical background or without technical background?<p>Let&#x27;s first restrict our scope to people with technical background and assume people already have a degree of understanding on how blockchain is used. Then if a developer tells you the README doesn&#x27;t convey the message clearly, take note of that and appreciate the feedback. Don&#x27;t say &quot;just trust me it works.&quot;<p>If this is to the general public, you better hire someone who can actually explain to user how it works from a high level giving analogy is always good.<p>In fact, you should never assume there are two groups of audience. This is not writing API documentation. A README should be really clear to user how to get started (understand what it does and how to start using it). Think about working with a manual. You can&#x27;t assume everyone know what certain nail is called by nickname. You need to write the actual name with an actual picture. Don&#x27;t assume.

Of course I will never know how Dropbox handles my files on their server securely, but at least I can understand when my file is transferred over HTTPS it&#x27;s encrypted in the communication and when they say they are over the cloud I know I can access it anywhere at anytime as long as I have an Internet access and the data center still exist.<p>And if I don&#x27;t understand what the software does how can I trust you to deploy this on my own term?

Just wasn&#x27;t ever interested. Didn&#x27;t know my sergeant from my brigadier.<p>The army took me seeing that I&#x27;m fit, for certain values of fit. Put me through boot-camp. That&#x27;s when I landed in military jail for the first time. I could take everything that was going on in there only with a dose of humour, but grinning 24/7 was apparently not acceptable behaviour. But that wasn&#x27;t what got me in jail.<p>There was one thing I could not take, absolutely. Still can&#x27;t. There wasn&#x27;t a moment to myself, I couldn&#x27;t ever get alone in there. I had to always be accounted for, from their point of view; but from mine I couldn&#x27;t find a place or the time to take a short meditation. I don&#x27;t know what I have, but I&#x27;ve been getting through it all my life with meditation, and once that wasn&#x27;t available I was heavily depressed. I thought of suicide, I talked of suicide, and that&#x27;s basically all I ever talked or thought about. While grinning at anything they had to say to me in return.<p>So I went home. Took my stuff and went out the gate.<p>Later came back and went to military jail for a sentence. Then for boot-camp number two, as I didn&#x27;t finish one.<p>But later when I did finish it on my second attempt, they didn&#x27;t want me anywhere near a base anymore. They wanted me out of base for most of the time. They way to achieve this in the army is to make you a driver. This way you&#x27;re driving around, not being in the base, problem solved.<p>If you read my previous comment, you know what the problem with that approach is. They didn&#x27;t. So I explained, repeatedly. Any time they&#x27;d let me see an officer that was in charge of that kind of thing, I&#x27;d explain that I can&#x27;t drive, won&#x27;t ever be able to, and not even torture can &quot;change my mind&quot;.<p>Either they have decided to test that last bit empirically, or just couldn&#x27;t wrap their heads around the idea of someone not being able to do something that &quot;any idiot could&quot;; but long story short I&#x27;ve done 7 months of prison time in three separate terms over the span of 1.5 years before they saw me as unfit for service and let me go, and be as I am.<p>That is to say, you&#x27;re not always in a position to find a workaround, if I may refer to your closing sentence.",1408160053

HTTPS relies on a centralised CA infrastructure, which is probably (indirectly) under the control of government anyway, so I don&#x27;t see how taking away the ability to MITM plain text connections will help; and governments would prefer that their exploits be done over HTTPS since a properly-forged certificate will look &quot;secure&quot;, and that makes the end-users more likely to blindly trust the authenticity of the content they download... it also means that firewalls and other systems designed to detect suspicious content in traffic (as much as they&#x27;re derided for being used for censorship-related purposes, ones under the control of the user can be beneficial) won&#x27;t catch the exploit either. I think that would be even worse.<p>HTTP causes some suspecion of the content, but HTTPS gives the impression of being secure, decreasing the level of suspicion while implicitly forcing the user to trust the CAs.<p>HTTPS with self-signed certificates that are exchanged in-person would probably provide the most secure authentication, but that doesn&#x27;t really scale.",1408158963

8185286,comment,8184463,8184740,1,0,comex,,,"Well, hold on - that&#x27;s oversimplifying.  Some developers do things like that, and some don&#x27;t.  Valve is an extreme example, but:<p>- They publish a free (as in beer) SDK and modding tools for Source, and allow people to submit mods to Steam - even if they use Valve IP, and charge users money for it (e.g. Aperture Tag).  (However, users have to have purchased the original game to run mods, and removing this limitation or accessing the Source source code requires a commercial license.)<p>- They have the Steam Workshop, which allows users to, depending on the game, submit assets for potential inclusion in Valve games (with revenue share), and upload custom maps for others to use directly.<p>- They have released specialized tools such as Source Filmmaker and the Portal 2 map maker to assist with user-generated content.<p>- And, of course, many of their flagship games were originally community mods: Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, DotA.<p>...Thus it&#x27;s hard to say Valve wants to &quot;mistreat the customer&quot; or doesn&#x27;t want users to create their own content.  Nor do they indulge that much in DRM.  Yet thus far, they have not released any free software.  Why?<p>I think it&#x27;s mainly a culture thing.  Free software games are essentially nonexistent.  In PC gaming there are plenty of small developers, and lately there&#x27;s a trend toward very early release and community engagement, all things associated with free software - but it&#x27;s all in a context where developers can and want to make money selling games, and source access is not expected.  This is nothing unusual, of course: in all of programming there are many, probably a majority, who are more likely to consider GPL a &quot;cancer&quot; preventing them from doing what they want than something to embrace.  (In mobile this is basically everyone.)  It&#x27;s just that the pockets of free software enthusiasm which exist in other subfields aren&#x27;t nearly as significant in gaming.  In such a context, GPL releases would just be a distraction from supporting users/indies in the way they want, and so we don&#x27;t see them.<p>I&#x27;m still holding out for a GPL release of Source 2, though...  And, as a point of hope: while the new Unreal Engine is not free software, its licensing and development model seems very much inspired by it, and to be designed to provide some of its benefits while allowing Epic to make money.",1408158781

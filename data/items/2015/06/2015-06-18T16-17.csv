9739973,comment,9739544,9739544,0,0,codegeek,,,"I bought a house 2 years ago. I bought it to &quot;live in it&quot; and not for &quot;investment&quot; (US East Coast for context).<p>The thing is that when you start buying houses/apartments/condos/townhomes to make money, that is when you <i>could</i> get into trouble.<p>Make no mistake though. Owning a home is very costly depending on the type of home and area. For example, my single family detached home costs me money for things like maintenance, repairs etc that come out of my pocket. Did I forget to mention &quot;Property Taxes&quot; ? In NJ, it can easily be over $1000 per month for a single family home worth 500K (yes it is not a typo. It is over $1000 <i>per</i> month). You are paying for all the schools and other stuff that you have access to.<p>So don&#x27;t buy a home just for financial reasons. Buy a home if :<p>- You want your &quot;own&quot; place and not worry about landlord bullshit (i hated my landlord charging me bogus cleaning costs once the lease was over. fuck that)<p>- You are not looking to use the house as an ATM or credit card. Try to refrain from Cash out refinance type of offers. Don&#x27;t get fooled into getting cash for another reset of your mortgage.<p>- You intend to live in the area hopefully for 5-7 years (ok things can go wrong but intention should be there)<p>- If something happens for the worse, you can still sell it (hint: don&#x27;t buy in an area where it is hard to sell)<p>- Very important: Put at least 20% down. There is a reason this is preferred. It gives you instant equity which means if the price fluctuates a bit (7-10%) down, you are still positive in case you had to sell due to unforeseen circumstances. I know it is the American dream to own a home but people trying to buy with 0 down or even 5% down are inviting trouble in today&#x27;s market at least. Try not to do that. Wait until you have the down payment.<p>Some more tips for rookie buyers:<p>Know the differences between buying say a condo vs a single family detached home. I personally don&#x27;t like condos or even townhomes because of their stricter community rules/HOA crap that they charge you for. I was looking at a condo once which said that they don&#x27;t allow outdoor bbqing unless you get permission. WTF. sorry, not for me. I want &quot;feedom&quot; to do things in my home. So for me, single family is the closest option. But for you it could be townhomes/condos for other reasons. So know the difference.",1434646685

You&#x27;ll be able to see them geek out a little bit and see that they really enjoyed getting to do it.<p>I&#x27;ve had this at several companies. I think I&#x27;ve always gotten past this litmus test in one of the interviews, be it on the phone, via Skype, or in person. The problem, for me personally, is the inevitable followup interview consisting of &quot;go to the board and scribble out a function that does X&quot;, and then of course &quot;after you&#x27;re done, I&#x27;ll add important details and I expect you to be able to modify the function to accommodate as if you were using a text editor&quot;.<p>I admit it, I fail at the &quot;get in front of the board&quot; problems. I&#x27;m downright terrible at them. I have no problem with the conversational interviews. I&#x27;m not bad at presenting tech to my peers at meetings and book clubs, but in an interview environment I&#x27;ll freeze up and, at best, come up with a very inefficient implementation. I hate it and it has probably cost me opportunities at places where the rest of the interview felt like it went great.<p>Yes I know what the Big O is, I know what the Big O of the optimal implementation would be. I can talk all about hashes, final, static, or whatever you think you&#x27;ll trip me up on. But when I&#x27;m up there writing code, every little mistake psyches me out more and more, especially I can&#x27;t just hit &quot;backspace&quot; to fix it.<p>At my previous job, after the phone interview they sent me a programming project to implement in a day or two. After submitting it, they had me go to an interview and talk about the solution with a group of engineers, followed by a short conversational interview. That project was my first time writing ruby and I got the position and have great recommendations since leaving the place.<p>Makes me wish that recommendations held more sway, or that more companies would do more of this &quot;here&#x27;s a task, send us the solution when you&#x27;re done with it&quot; type of thing. Dishonest candidates would easily be exposed when they&#x27;re forced to discuss the solution in depth.<p>Of course, upon walking out of the building, all the answers magically pop into my head...",1434646512

9739867,comment,9738254,9738254,0,0,bcantrill,,,"As someone who has dedicated their career to understanding and debugging software in production[1], it&#x27;s hard to not be depressed about this -- not only because it (emphatically) isn&#x27;t &quot;awesome&quot;, but also because of the failure to couch this in its proper context: this is -- at best -- a kludge to enable small programs to be debugged in development.  While this is fine at some level (debugging is, after all, a good thing), small programs in development aren&#x27;t where the most pernicious bugs are found; sophisticated tooling should (in my opinion) always focus on the production systems in which the nastiest, most undebuggable problems arise.<p>Note that this needn&#x27;t mean that the tools themselves run in production:  for example, Valgrind is incredibly useful because it finds really nasty, production-grade issues -- even if it is only meaningfully usable in development.  Similarly, postmortem debugging tooling is extraordinarily valuable for production problems -- and requires no tooling in the production environment itself.  We have developed such tooling for node.js[2], and found it to be invaluable.  There is nascent postmortem debugging support for Go[3], but there is much more to be done -- just hoping that some in the Go community see the value of debugging production problems!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Debugging-Production-Systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Debugging-Production-Syst...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/node-summit2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/node-summit2013</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.joyent.com/blog/mdb-support-for-go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyent.com/blog/mdb-support-for-go</a>",1434645998

It&#x27;s essentially code which tries to simulate the neurons in a brain.<p>Over the last few years, there have been some really cool results, like using neural networks to read people&#x27;s handwriting, or to figure what objects are in a picture.<p>To start your neural network, you give it a bunch of pictures of dogs, and tell it that those pictures contain dogs. Then you give it pictures of airplanes, and say those are airplanes, etc. Like a child learning for the first time, the neural network updates its neurons to recognize what makes up a dog or an airplane.<p>Afterwords, you can give it a picture and ask if the pic contains a dog or an airplane.<p>The problem is that WE DON&#x27;T NOW HOW IT KNOWS! It could be using the shape of a dog, or the color, or the distance between it&#x27;s legs. We don&#x27;t know! We just can&#x27;t see what the neurons are doing. Like a brain, we don&#x27;t quite know how it recognize things.<p>Google had a big neural network to figure out what&#x27;s in an image, and they wanted to know what it did. So, they gave the neural net a picture, but stopped the neural net at different points, before it could finish deciding. When, they stopped it, they asked it to &quot;enhance&quot; what is just recognized. Eg. if it just saw the outline of a dog, the net would return the picture with the outline a bit thicker. Or, if it saw the colors similar to a banana, it would return the picture with those colors looking more like a banana&#x27;s colors.<p>This seems like a simple idea, but it&#x27;s actually really complex, and really insightful!

9739731,comment,9737156,9738489,0,0,malkia,,,"I worked on the port of MGS to PC back in 1999-2000. Here is what I&#x27;ve learned:<p>- Models were not &quot;skinned&quot; as it was popular in the day. Some textures were covering only the front part of the body, others arms, etc. As such it was possible to use very little colors per texture (16) and use palettes (which is a very small &quot;texture&quot; in the graphics memory). If models were skinned they would&#x27;ve required all the colors used anywhere on the body, and would produce other unpleasant effects (different sampling frequency, especially on the shoulders, etc.) Konami&#x27;s character modeling is top-notch.<p>- Music/Sound - this was enignma for us. We were never given their internal sound mixer, but the popular metal gear tune was &quot;mod&quot;-like with very short samples - all of this + game effects was fitting in a 512kb audio buffer (adpcm).<p>- Game used overlays for the executable part. About 600kb were a main/shared/common part, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken 100kb or a bit more were swapped (the overlay). The main part would declare entry-points to be reached, and the &quot;swapped&quot; overlay were like many .so/.dylib/.dll files that knew about the main part.<p>- TCL-like language was used to script the game, the radio, traps/objects in the game, etc. Each character would have a &quot;main&quot; like function that accepted (int argc, const char argv[]) and handled the arguments from there (these were directly from the TCL scripts). Ah, the whole thing used &quot;C&quot; only.<p>- So 600kb+100kb, leaves you about 1.0mb for objects, &quot;scenerio&quot; files to be loaded, etc. Since our port was more or less &quot;wrap&quot; the PSX libs as PC, we didn&#x27;t have to change too much, just on the surface - a bit like patching here and there.<p>- The game used a tricky pointer hack, basically on the PSX accessing a pointer with the highest-24-bit set means read it from the CPU cache, otherwise not (or maybe the other way around). This was used for example to indicate whether the C4 bomb was planted on the ground, or on the wall instead of keeping a booblean/bit flag for it. Possibly was used for some more things. Since it was 24-bit, that meant 16mb.<p>To work on Windows we had to ensure that we don&#x27;t go above the 16mb (and the exe starts from 4MB), we also had all overlays for the game compiled-in rather than doing the swapping as the game did, but we had plenty of space even then to fit. It&#x27;s possible that we might&#x27;ve messed up some of the AI tweaks, but no one complained, and we were young and did not care. Then I had something to find all places where these pointers were used and mask them out when they had to be read, but kept the 24-bit highest bit in there (okay, it&#x27;s a bit like tagging I&#x27;ve learned much later when I did some Common Lisp).<p>- As we couldn&#x27;t do shit about having the original mod-music working, we relied on couple of then popular MGS web-sites and &quot;stole&quot; from them the whole music piece, and other things which came as an audio &quot;pre-rendered&quot; form, and then played them directly from our game. Ah... So embarrased!<p>- On my part I&#x27;m really proud that I was able to do a global-hack where I kept the fixed-point coordinates sub-pixel precision, so our PC port did not &quot;tremble&quot; or &quot;shake&quot; like others to come. Basically on the PSX when you draw a triangle, the &quot;chip&quot; makes all numbers integer pixels, and each vertex &quot;sticks&quot; to a concrete pixel - this makes &quot;shimmering&quot; like feature, and I was able to get around it.<p>- The other team-mates were able to get software/hardware renderring (directx I think 3, or was it 5?...). Konami used quite a lot of rendering trick that were not available back then. For example the camo-suit basically used the framebuffer as texture, from the location where the character was rendered - so it looked a bit like shimmering!<p>- Two lessons learned from it - We&#x27;ve put much better high-res textures for the eyes (hired someone from Texas to do it for us), when we got the idea rejected by Hideo himself (by the phone), he told us (through the interpretter) that the game during normal game-play did not have any eye-movement, so higher-res textures would look like crap, while with a blurry texture your own eyes won&#x27;t see it as a problem - it&#x27;s really sometimes LESS is better.<p>- Another was from my boss back then. We had to have a very strict frame-rate - I thnink 30fps otherwise some things were not properly emulated. On some older machines we had the fps going below 15fps, due to the actual renderering, not game code - and since he had experience, he simply said - we&#x27;ll just skip the drawing of frame then to gain some time. Now that seemed like thing that it should not work, but it did - and saved us from trying to do a non-constant frame-rate hacks.<p>- Another minor tidbid. The game reffered to it&#x27;s files/chunks/etc. by using a 16-bit CRC, since there were quite of lot of objects - almost 32000 overall, there would be collisions, but the way Konami solved it was by simply renaming an object, rather than changing the hash-function, or something else. It puzzled us why some soldiers were called charaB or chara4 without other numbers, but when I got afraid of hash-collision, and saw that there are none (for all objects in the game) it kind of explained.<p>- Who knows how many other treasures we did not discover. In all working on it, made me love the &quot;C&quot; language more than &quot;C++&quot; then. The code was only with japanese comments, and early on I wrote a very simple translator - using the offline Star Dictionary (I&#x27;ve downloaded from somewhere), while it was not much usable, apart from really weird to understand (at first) code or algorithm, it also uncovered things like &quot;CONTINEKU&quot; &quot;METARU GIRU SORIDU&quot; (Continue, Metal Gear Solid), and at first I was like... are these folks writing english with japanese symbols?<p>- They had a dedicated &quot;optimization&quot; programmer - he basically went through the code, have found the hot-spots and turned them into assembly (mainly model t-junction extrapolations, splitting the model in pieces to fit in the small 1kb fast-cache, and few others). Hopefully he kept the original &quot;C&quot; code, and it was easier for us to choose the right part here and there.",1434645093

It was to counter the assertion that desalination is impractical because it necessarily increases them.  The scope of this discussion was limited to addressing that assertion, not to list ways to reduce CO2 emissions in general.<p>Rainwater collection is not a substitute for desalination because in many years there is little or no rain.  The author&#x27;s principal position is that there is no drought because once every 10 or 20 years there is (or was) a wet one; of course, to conclude this he includes the extremely wet 2004 and excludes the extremely dry 2013-2015.  Even if we ignore his cherry-picking, that position is not a sensible one; it is equivalent to asserting that with an infinitely large reservoir, California would always have enough water regardless of the consumption rate.  The reality is that consumption exceeds the long-term average supply by a considerable margin and has increased due to population growth even as the likely future supply is shrinking.  Furthermore, large quantities of water cannot be stored forever; it evaporates, seeps into the ground, or both.  The wet years, rare even in the past and likely to be moreso in the future, don&#x27;t come often enough to keep reservoirs full.  There&#x27;s also the problem of the inland cities, where even historical average rainfall is far below 14 inches a year, which the author conveniently ignores.<p>Rainwater collection and recycling of treated sewage are therefore necessary but insufficient measures (at least in southern and inland California; they&#x27;re probably sufficient for places like Eureka).  In addition to those measures, additional sources will have to be found and/or large-scale reductions in consumption will be required.  Desalination is perhaps the only plausible means of increasing supply (all Western river systems are already critically oversubscribed), and while it is costly, it does come without the political problems of forcibly reducing consumption.  As such, I predict that solar-powered desalination will eventually become the central piece of the state&#x27;s response to its water shortage.  It does a good job of matching plentiful resources (solar energy, ocean water) to visible needs (more water for coastal cities).  It does not address the needs of agriculture, but nothing can.  The only policy options with respect to agriculture are in assigning the required curtailments.  For political reasons, they&#x27;ll probably also build more storage, but the practical benefits of that storage to agricultural users will be minimal as it will be empty or dead pool most of the time.<p>These aren&#x27;t things anyone wants to hear, but they&#x27;re reality.  The author, like many others, is whistling past the graveyard.  Anyone who believes that simple, inexpensive measures can address the problem is in denial of its true scope and scale.",1434644047

Not once have I made a typo when I wanted an arrow function.<p>Of course <i>any</i> syntax can be abused in such a way to create ugly code. But if I compare<p><pre><code>    [1, 2, 3].map( a => a * a );  // [1, 4, 9]
</code></pre>
to<p><pre><code>    [1, 2, 3].map(function(a) { return a * a; });

I prefer the former. It&#x27;s more concise, and strips off a lot of visual noise, and I think it&#x27;s more readable (the intent isn&#x27;t wrapped in lots of boilerplate).<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean one can&#x27;t write horrible code with the arrow form. Of course you can. Furthermore, it&#x27;s not necessarily something you should use all the time, because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> completely analogous to a normal `function` because it binds `this` lexically. Which means `function` isn&#x27;t going away any time soon, especially if you need to bind them dynamically.<p>In short: use the best (syntactic) tool for the job.

9259054,comment,9256152,9258731,0,0,bartkappenburg,,,"Thanks for your comment, and yes, I object to your qualification of a con-artist.<p>First, manipulation in my view is an unethical forced change of behaviour (buying something you don&#x27;t want). We don&#x27;t manipulate people with our tool (I&#x27;ll come back to that later).<p>Secondly, con-artists are people that mislead and manipulate other people to have a (personal) gain, either financially or otherwise.<p>So, imagine an online shop. That shop has some usps (best widgets in town, fast delivery) and some information on each product (number in stock, number of buys etc etc). That information is usually &#x27;embedded&#x27; on the site (frontpage, product details, checkout page). To communicate all those pros you would have to guess where in the user journey the customer has the need to read one of those perks (or you could just repeat them over and over again which hurts the user experience).<p>Our tool takes those usps and information and targets those at the right customer at the right time. You hate social proof? Fine, we won&#x27;t bother you with that. You need a confirmation about the trustworthiness of the store? Fine, here&#x27;s why the shop is to be trusted (reputation, expert in field etc etc)<p>We know what is important to you (qualifying) and communicate that. That&#x27;s not manipulation or a con-artist&#x27;s MO because it&#x27;s true and we don&#x27;t mislead you. We know, based on your data, what your needs are. (if a shop owner wants to communicate false claims, that&#x27;s fine, but in the long run people are not buying there anymore. See my other comment on this subject).<p>Persuasion is everywhere, whether you like it or not. We just try to make it more effective by removing all the random persuasion messages (which are sometimes screaming at you) and finding out what works for whom and when.",1427227155

9259035,comment,9253359,9253508,0,0,ndamiano,,,"We started our company out of the Stanford Biodesign fellowship and are part of the current YC batch. We are making an implantable medical device - the old school kind with no software involved.<p>Medical device innovation is broken. Companies developing devices like ours are taking 10 years and $100M to see revenue, and most people in the industry consider this time and cost inevitable. For that reason, investment in the space has plummeted. ROIs suck. The thing is though that it&#x27;s not inevitable. The space is ripe for smarter and more efficient ways to bring products to market. This process innovation is not coming from academia, nor will it ever. Academics just doesn&#x27;t think that way, and they&#x27;re categorically not good at commercialization. This new thinking is coming from independent startups that embrace a hacker mentality and reject conventional wisdom. As we all know, that&#x27;s very similar to the ethos of YC.<p>Stanford Biodesign has a stellar track record of producing medtech winners, and that&#x27;s because its process works. The advice we&#x27;ve heard from the YC partners in the program has aligned very well with the advice we heard from the top forward-thinking entrepreneurs in the industry at Biodesign. They get it. YC partners may not understand the intricacies of healthcare as well as industry veterans, but it doesn&#x27;t need to. They understand how to build a great company regardless of vertical. YC brings in top founders from industry, who already have the necessary expertise and connections, and encourages them to think big and think differently. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s not a winning formula. Yes, healthcare is different, but it&#x27;s similar to other typical YC verticals in more ways than you think.",1427227037

Not only survive, but once the dust settles they are the few left to soak up any new investments.<p>Boom/bust cycles can be thought of as a redistribution of bad investments, which often time results in the demise of fresh competitors or, at best, the assimilation of &quot;failed&quot; capital (human, tech, infrastructure) of those ventures into the companies which successfully navigate the transition at a very low cost.<p>The bubble that different parties speak about when talking about the tech world has to do not so much with the amount of money flowing into that sector as an aggregate, but the near-exponential growth in new companies and the unfathomable valuations of some of them which are hard to justify.",1427226635

There&#x27;s literally zero chance that all, most, or really even a significant <i>some</i> of them will be enough to earn their developers significant amount of money.<p>How many Windows developers make enough from their one-off piece of software that they can quit their job and work full time on it? Hardly any. How many Linux developers? An even smaller amount, closer to zero (you want to talk about a platform where people expect to get free-as-in-beer software, when was the last time you paid money for any non-enterprise Linux software?). Now look at the difference between a PC and an iPhone. On a PC, you can have meaningful, long-term engagements with software. I&#x27;ve put hundreds of hours into each Civilization and Elder Scrolls games, thousands of hours between the entire series of each. And iPhone games advertise a huge game at under 10 hours of gameplay. I spend $50 to play a game for 500 hours. If I want that kind of return from an iPhone game, even 99 cents is way too much to spend.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that the apps need to be more engaging. It&#x27;s just the platform doesn&#x27;t lend itself to that. It&#x27;s about small bits and bites and sporadic usage. And for that, apps are even massively <i>over</i>-priced. And you want to argue about discoverability? How is the discoverability on Windows? And the discoverability on Linux... on Debian the package is apache2, on RHEL it&#x27;s httpd. Same package. <i>That&#x27;s</i> poor discoverability.<p>I&#x27;ll go against the article: I&#x27;m not an Apple fanatic, I don&#x27;t own a Mac, I have an iPhone as one of the many phones I use, I don&#x27;t have an iPad, I&#x27;ve never published to the store, and I have no relationship with Apple. But is there anything wrong with the App Store? If there is, it&#x27;s in developer expectations. I&#x27;ve written Windows and Linux software and put it up for free on my website. You know how many views it gets, let alone downloads? Zero. I get around that lack of income by having a job and developing as a hobby, like most software (except, I guess, the App Store). The App Store is an incredible thing for developers, but many developers see it as nothing more than a gold mine that they can exploit, then get upset when they only make $100/mo, even though they put in all that effort. Effort doesn&#x27;t guarantee success <i>anywhere</i> in life.<p>If you feel Apple owes you anything, that&#x27;s your own damn fault. There has never been a better time to be an independent developer than there is right now.

It means Apple gets an army of developers producing software for Apple with zero health/unemployment/other benefits, no up-front advance payments, and a limited curation cost.<p>The risks are entirely on the developer side. There is no downside for Apple.<p>Secondly momentum creates the usual extreme power law, with most of the benefits going to a small minority of developers.<p>What makes an app sell is some random combination of luck, faddiness, and marketing muscle.<p>It certainly isn&#x27;t inherent quality or &quot;fit&quot;. In fact you seem to be using &quot;fit&quot; as a rationalisation for app successes, not as a useful description of the processes that make an app successful - some of which seem to random.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the bottom line: devs like to that puts on a stage routine about having the right stuff, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect it to do stuff right.<p>The point: the benefits of keeping devs onside and treating them with more respect would be immense, and probably economically incalculable.<p>Apple would have an instant army of fanboys/girls talking up the company to anyone who would listen. App quality would go way up to the point where iOS could potentially totally kill Android. App and hardware sales would increase further, and you&#x27;d get a classic virtuous cycle.<p>Unfortunately when you have a war chest heading towards $1tn you probably don&#x27;t feel any need to care about the little people, and &quot;eh - whatever&quot; is good enough for you.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean the opportunity wasn&#x27;t real, or that it hasn&#x27;t been squandered.<p>It was and it has.

Complexity theory is about finding algorithms which provably optimize some notion of efficiency. Any notion of efficiency. Complexity theory is not equivalent to using asymptotic notation to describe things. In particular, when you find an algorithm that has, say, O(n) worst-case runtime, then you know that the time-complexity of the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve is O(n). It could be better, like O(log n), and the goal of complexity theory is to do better or prove you can&#x27;t. You could also try to find the query complexity of a learning problem in terms of the accuracy desired, or the round complexity of a problem solved by MapReduce algorithms in terms of the number of processors and the size of the input.<p>> How does the algorithm perform in concurrent computing? Clearly we’d prefer an algorithm that can scale over processors to one that can’t ... Certainly there is a way to put this all together in theory, but I don’t know those details.<p>There are no details to know. Any time you have any parameter of any system which can grow (processors, input size, time, space, cache layers) you can describe <i>anything depending on that parameter</i> using asymptotic notation to get a rough estimate of its efficiency. This is not a question of complexity, just a question of how to express growth rates succinctly. Knowing how to reason about rough estimates is essential for engineers because they have to have some idea about why the thing they&#x27;re building will conform to specifications at least in principle before devoting the resources to measuring it precisely.<p>And to reiterate: none of this has anything to do with complexity theory except that in complexity theory we happen to use asymptotic notation very heavily.

9258764,comment,9256803,9257687,0,0,Trisell,,,"Lets dispel a few myths:<p>Fire has to have three things to burn, Fuel, Oxygen, and Heat. This is called the fire tetrahedron, and is the primary theory behind fire fighting. If you eliminate one, then the fire is unable to maintain a chemical reaction, and goes out.<p><i>With forest fires you&#x27;re constantly running out of water, and the only way to ship it the location it is needed is often multi-hour drives (which consume a lot of fuel).</i><p>Most forest fires are not fought with water, they use fuel reduction to control the fire and eventually starve it of fuel. This is why forest fires are multi-week, or even seasonal events, because you essentially have to dig a fuel free line around the entirety of a fire to starve it of fuel, so that it eventually burns it&#x27;s self out. On the largest of fires, it usually is a game of trying to drive the fire in the direction you want it to burn, and waiting for a weather event, such as a rain storm, to either put the fire out, or bed the fire down enough that you can put a line around it and contain it.<p><i>Now, yes, fires can reignite. However that is also true with water, water evaporates extremely quickly from an area that was on fire both because that area is extremely dry, because of the ambient heat, and also because it likely started out hot to begin with.</i><p>With water in direct firefighting you are removing one side of the fire tetrahedron, heat. In a small fire, say a house, you are able to use enough water, to overcome the number of BTUs that the fire is creating, via steam conversion. Water expands to steam at a ratio of 1:1700. In structure firefighting, you can put out a small room fire with a quick burst of water, say 20 - 30 gallons, and through steam conversion(because steam is still much cooler then fire) put the fire out. You will then have to follow up and cool of the remainder of the room.<p>In large urban fires, the use of water is less about putting the fire out, as much as controlling the expansion of the fire, and limiting it to the original building/location, and waiting for the fire to burn it&#x27;s self out. Even with 20 or 30 fire trucks pumping 1000s of gallons of water, large fires produce more heat then we are capable of dissipating, so we again wait for fuel to be starved, and the chemical reaction to reduce.<p><i>Fire retardants help keeping fires out, but they&#x27;re bad for the environment and are also hard to keep supplied in remote areas, and when you&#x27;re refilling directly from a river.</i><p>Most fire retardants that are used in active firefighting are 100% biodegradable. Almost all toxic(and even the ones that are still legal, have a diminishing lifespan as they have been banned from being further produced, see Halon fire extinguishers for an example.) have been removed, both for environmental, and firefighter safety.<p>The problem that I see with device, is that is does not have the capability to scale. To be able to remove 100% of the oxygen from an environment, even the small size that they are testing on, is not realistic. When you begin to get to large fires, you are talking about having to move millions of cubic feet of oxygen, and what are you replacing that air with? They are using this on a very small fire with very volatile fuel(rubbing alcohol). My guess would be that they are not only using sound waves, but that they are getting a certain amount of air movement that is also helping with extinguish, as they are also changing the fuel to air ratio that the fire needs to burn, thus putting the fire out.<p>There is billions of dollars spent each year to perfect fire extinguish, and I would believe that if it was as easy as pointing a sub woofer at a fire and putting it out, we would all have sub woofers in our ceilings, not water pipes and sprinklers.<p><i>Experience: I spent 10 years in the structural and wildland fire service as a volunteer where we had an average of 100 house fires a year, and 30 wildland fires a summer.</i>",1427224457

Its a pretty strong factor. Recognizing that it exists isn&#x27;t gross. You seem to have problems differentiating descriptive statements from positive value judgements on the thing described.<p>> See, that&#x27;s the problem I have with all of this. The fact that we seem to condone psychological manipulation in marketing as okay because it&#x27;s not outright lying and most of the time it&#x27;s not that bad<p>That has nothing to do with what I said. In fact, I disagree, it often is outright lying and often is quite bad. All I said was that the badness isn&#x27;t, in any respect, new, though the study of how it works may be.",1427223821
9258695,comment,9256082,9258032,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"I find the idea that optionals aren&#x27;t pragmatic pretty bizarre.  Of all the features that &quot;advanced&quot; type systems give you, optionals are some of the most straightforward.  I still haven&#x27;t heard a convincing argument for why they should not be in Go (e.g., someone pointed out that all types in Go have a default value, but there is a very obvious candidate for a default value for optionals--None; &quot;in practice these issues don&#x27;t come up&quot;--doesn&#x27;t that just mean people don&#x27;t <i>use</i> null much?  Why allow it to inhabit every type, then?).<p>Anyway, neither Dart nor Go is particularly &quot;close to the hardware&quot; as they both have fairly substantial runtimes.  We&#x27;re not talking about a macro assembler here, we&#x27;re talking about a typed programming language.  What the compiler does under the hood is largely irrelevant in any language that doesn&#x27;t make a distinction between register, stack, and heap allocation.",1427223815

Hell, the easiest way to get the latest etcd running is via docker (golang has a really slick base image for projects btw).<p>Dockerfiles tend to work much faster than vagrant does in terms of launching a new VM vs building/starting a derivative container.

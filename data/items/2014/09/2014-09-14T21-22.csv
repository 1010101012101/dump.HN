With HTTPS, the communication is private between the user and _a_ server. I believe only the NSA has accurate numbers, but I guess a whole lot of the servers users are talking to are the correct one.<p>Authentication comes _on top of that_ so we can predict this number with more accuracy. But you may not need to; maybe your conversation really is public, maybe you don&#x27;t care. The thing is that we actually _can_ make it so that everyone can be happy with that: those who expect a minimum of privacy and those who don&#x27;t.<p>We can provide encryption; it&#x27;s easy and cheap. It doesn&#x27;t mean the communication is 100% secure (it never is), but it means it&#x27;s fare better than what we have today. We must do it. Again, it doesn&#x27;t mean communications will be secure, and browsers should certainly not display unauthenticated encrypted communications with the reassuring green lock; it means they should show _all_ HTTP connections as completely insecure and unauthenticated HTTPS connections as mildly secure.<p>By the way, your model is called Trust On First Use or TOFU [0] and is already used in some crypto domains, most notably ssh.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dotdotike/Trust_Upon_First_Use"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dotdotike/Trust_Upon_Firs...</a>",1410731418

It seems to be roughly equivalent to an AWS m3.xlarge instance.  Trackpad is flush with the case, which prevents food crumbs & dirt from getting stuck in it like it did with the MBP.  Pretty rugged construction.  Haven&#x27;t had any reliability issues and I&#x27;ve had it a year or so.  Good display.  Has a numeric keypad and the cursor navigation keys, unlike the Mac.  Linux &quot;just works&quot;, since Ubuntu comes pre-installed with auto updates.

If by messy he means fairly straightforward code but not built for easy extension and lacking proper layout/architecture then a few days is enough.<p>On the other hand if by messy he means complex code implementing requirements in a non-obvious way then it could take much longer. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of code that uses multiple layers of indirection when a simple switch statement would suffice. Where code that looks like a simple mistake is actually implementing a critical requirement. Where you have to keep multiple heavily abstracted domain models in your head at once to understand the code because there is no clean separation.<p>It depends on how well you need to understand the code to be able to make changes. Reasonably well written code can be skimmed at speeds of up to 2500 lines of code an hour and only the core domain objects and algorithms need more intense study.<p>On the other hand if you have to understand the entire codebase in order to change it then 100 lines of code an hour is an upper limit.<p>So anywhere from half a day to two weeks depending on what you mean by messy.",1410730376

The book is full of proofs involving probability theory and computational complexity theory.  It&#x27;s also kind of dry; I had a hard time reading it.<p>My complexity and probability theory are both at kind of an elementary level, so I&#x27;m sure it will take me several more years of periodically reading this type of material to get a good grasp of what &quot;randomized algorithms&quot; really are.<p>However, like I said this type of material contains a bunch of complexity and/or probability theory, but Eliezer&#x27;s conclusion doesn&#x27;t really seem to be drawn from the same level of rigor that I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere (at least he didn&#x27;t publish his proofs here, did I miss something).  So I&#x27;m not sure how much I really want to trust his conclusion.<p>Also if his conclusion is correct in a way that provides useful derandomization algorithms (that is an algorithm to derandomize other algorithms), then why are the academics all talking about nondeterministic turing machines?  It seems like we could move past that (although I&#x27;m willing to accept that nondeterministic turing machines are an archaic idea from a bygone era that people continue to cling to because it gets them grant money, but I would like the proof of this so I can be certain it&#x27;s safe not to spend my time on it).<p>Finally, if his conclusion is correct, is it correct in a way that will allow me to get work done?  I guess my point is that I would rather not rely on intuition in order to derandomize my algorithms if I can use some sort of technique or series of techniques.  Additionally, it seems like understanding such a technique would also answer a lot of the questions I had about the nature of randomized algorithms in the first place, so if there&#x27;s anyone out there who knows about these things (or has a list of papers/books/websites) I would really appreciate if you step in and give us your two cents.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Randomized_Algorithms.html?id=QKVY4mDivBEC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/about/Randomized_Algorithms.ht...</a>",1410730141

Kind of a like a class in OO programming.<p>Just like Erlang has explicit processes and message sending primitives So it is pretty simple and concise at that level. In order to build large systems there is OTP (or e2) that embodies and abstracts away some common patterns/behaviours: gen_event, gen_server, gen_fsm, supervisors, logging, distribution between nodes etc.<p>I imagine over time go will acquire those kind of libraries (maybe it already has them?).<p>There is also an interesting duality between Erlang and Go. In one case there are explicit processes (identified by PIDs) + an anonymous (implicit) mailbox. Where go has anonymous goroutines but explicitly identifiably channels.  It seems they are duals. You can simulate one with another. And you can build concurrency patterns on top of them.<p>I personally prefer Erlang&#x27;s model to think about concurrency. There is an active entity -- a client request, a server, a socket handler, it has a an id/name, it can be monitored for liveliness, it can be halted, upgraded, killed, can send messages to it.  Somehow to me that makes it easier to map to concurrent problem domains. Channels can ultimately do the same things but it is harder for me to design using goroutines.",1410730127

They can be useful for quick prototypes. They do a competent basic job for in-house tools written by people who aren&#x27;t front-end developers and just need something that works.

8316235,comment,8305283,8315692,1,0,pedrocr,,,"> Also, quite likely using a fast compression algorithm like lzop on the file would make disk access faster and disk storage requirements lower.<p>>Using an online algorithm is the whole point, I&#x27;ve been saying that from the start. And I remember that Knuth wrote about them so I conclude that they exist for sort, and I quite expect that GNU sort(1) is already sorting big files efficiently (limited testing seems to confirm that, files several times the size of RAM sort just fine in the low single digit minute count).<p>The cp algorithm already solves this just fine and my proposed reimplementation on-disk solves the RAM usage problem. You&#x27;re trying to make a strictly worse algorithm work. It both requires more storage and is heavier than it needs to be (full sort vs just a map). What do you expect to gain from it?",1410728792

The first was the realisation at how unbelievably (dangerously) intelligent Osama bin Laden was in choosing to attack both the symbol of, and actual, base of US financial power.<p>The other was the absolutely I impressive resilience of the federal money men to ensure that this attack was ultimately unsuccessful in bringing down the US financial systems in a permanent basis.<p>I imagine that 17th September 2001 could have gone very badly when the markets opened. I think this must have been a close run thing.<p>One thing I also noted is that such a review is also a security risk in itself. To truly bring down the US financial sector you would now have the attack blue print from the resulting report. While things have moved on, it does give the enemies of the US a dangerous handbook of targets for success.<p>Anyway, I found this fascinating. Thanks for posting this.",1410728439

587638,comment,587032,587254,0,0,blurry,,,"A few months ago, I did the same course here in the US and I am sorry to report that I did not have a great experience.<p>For one, I was disappointed with the supposed difficulty or profundity of the course. Just like <i>miles</i> above, my fellow attendees, the teacher, the guru, and the friend who recommended the course to me in the first place, all described the experience in very dramatic terms (hell, heaven, profound impact, etc, etc). In reality, for 10 days, you don't do anything but sit in a dimly lit room for hours on end and concentrate on your breathing and other sensations. In between, you eat and sleep. That is <i>all</i>. Personally, I haven't found it especially challenging to shut up and focus for a few days. I also can't say that several days of highly-enhanced perception that followed the course had any profound long-term effect on my life. It was nice, but not more than that. (Those of you who do yoga probably know what I am talking about - those couple hours of feeling balanced, clear-headed and less ""ADD"" immediately following a yoga class).<p>Also, I felt that the course was misrepresented. What attracted me to this particular form of meditation was the promise of a 100% non-religious, 100% evidence-based practice. The website, the live teacher and the videotaped guru/founder S.N. Goenka stressed over and over the importance of <i>personally</i> and <i>physically</i> experiencing any insights. On the first day, we were told that we must simply observe any sensations that come with the breathing and not intellectualize the experience or give it any meaning other than <i>what is</i>. However the very next day, we were fed a whole bunch of hooey about the life of Buddha Gautama and the attendant reincarnation theory. The Buddha's tale was presented as a true story, and the reincarnation cycle was presented as the imperative to practice Vipassana mediation. The gist of it was, if you are good (i.e. you practice) you will eventually graduate to an enlightened status, but if you are bad (you don't practice, or waste your time with other meditation methods that may mean well but are silly because they focus on chanting or other false techniques) you will continue to suffer here on Earth. I really didn't appreciate the disconnect between the non-sectarian promise of the course and the reality of what the guru was telling us from his videotape each evening.<p>To be fair, I will add that the brainwashing is of spiritual rather than commercial nature and the course organizers do not want anything from you other than to ""get"" it. I would say that if you can set aside the negative aspects I mentioned above and you have 10 days to spare, it's a great way to reset your focus. Just don't buy it when they tell you that something incredible happens on the sixth day. They re-iterate over and over during the first 5 days that you must stick it out and something profound will happen on Day Six, but it's the same thing every day - meditate, eat, sleep, meditate, eat, sleep.",1241128623

587627,comment,587180,587180,0,0,jpedrosa,,,"I came up with my own technique for developing ""GUI"" without any fancier tool than standard programming languages and their frameworks.<p>I create a launcher called ""weboot"" that gets parameters like directory and URL resource to start on. It launches an http server process and sends a command to the browser via command-line (but could use other means) with a generated URL (because you don't want to be stuck on an already used port). Browser goes to: <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8066/some_resource"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8066/some_resource</a><p>Now you have HTML+JavaScript for the frontend and your preferred web framework and tools on the backend. It all costs just as much as you use, so don't launch Apache, just a small http server will do. ;-)<p>The secret comes next. The frontend needs to ping the backend every several seconds to keep it from shutting down on purpose. The reason is that after the user closes the browser or the tab, the server process has done its job and should close automatically. It all works very well on Linux. I have created a small calculator and a tetris game to test this already and I pompously called them widgets. ;-)<p>I also have my own ideas for creating an IRC client based on this technique as I have created several versions of IRC clients over the years and even though XChat works great for me on Linux so I don't have a real urge to do that again, it's a trivial exercise in the same way the tetris game was. When I get my bugs list under control I might give it a go again.<p>So, the JavaScript side loops with something like:<p>setInterval(function(){ new AjaxRequest('/ping'); }, 5000);<p>These values are all tunable. I started with a ping every 5 seconds and the server closes in 12 seconds (two pings + some extra time), but I pulled those numbers out of thin air and in 12 seconds I can even reopen a tab fast enough to avoid the server dieing in case of trouble. ;-)<p>I like Ruby rather than Python, and I have used GTK+ with Ruby for a while myself, but the GTK+ development in Ruby has been a little under trouble as it seems as if no one who is good enough at C and Ruby has it as a high priority on their list of things to maintain, with more and more things moving to the web and so on...<p>Also, even the development of GTK+ itself and Gnome in general seem to be under a little trouble as more developers seek greener pasture elsewhere and new blood is rarer to come by to replace them. Things like QT, Swing, SWT (Eclipse's UI toolkit?), and even Gtk# (Mono) are generally on another planet than low level C required by GTK+.<p>Good luck.",1241128328

Merely mining it kills three to four dozen people in the US directly every year, on average, since the 90s (and it was dramatically higher in the past).  I don't think I need to mention to HN that the production of nuclear power has killed zero people in that period.  The waste produced by the burning of coal dwarfs the waste that is generated per kWh...it's literally several orders of magnitude larger.  And the shortened lives of people breathing coal pollution certainly adds up to dramatically larger impact than that of nuclear waste.<p>Yes, coal pollution is ""safer"" the nuclear waste in equal amounts, but neither is clean, and nuclear waste (low-grade or otherwise) can be contained safely, while coal simply produces too much to store or convert to non-dangerous forms.<p>I talked to a Greenpeace activist a few weeks ago to try to understand how Greenpeace can <i>still</i> be anti-nuclear energy with all that we know about the costs of the alternatives.  Obviously, an on-the-street activist isn't necessarily representative of all of Greenpeace, but she did have a pamphlet about nuclear energy that she was very familiar with.  In short, there is no recognition in their materials that nuclear power and nuclear weapons are dramatically different (and so, ""no nukes!"" applied equally to weapons and energy in her mind, and she simply couldn't imagine that one could exist without the other).  There was also a deep-seated denial about coal and the realistic options for moving off of coal.  Her response was, ""We shouldn't compromise on clean energy, it's too important.  We need clean sources of energy, like solar and wind, to replace coal and nuclear power.""  Obviously, there's no reasoning with this sort of mentality.",1241125605

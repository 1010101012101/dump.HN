The NYRB feels a tad parochial (inward-looking) at times, its subject matter a tad more restricted than the TLS. But it&#x27;s great they got Zadie Smith to write a piece for the anniversary issue, I love her voice. Actually a bit ashamed to say I haven&#x27;t been keeping tabs on the both the TLS and the NYRB - I used to spend hours with stacks of them to pass the time and discover new pastures in uni - in a while.",1383992159

I deeply regret that the government made such an <i>announcement</i> with &quot;nothing&quot; to show.<p>Just imagine a startup making such an announcement on HN, to show only XLS documents, and calling it OpenData...
Well, that&#x27;s just what it looked like when that post made it to the front page of HN.<p>Recently, the government proudly announced an &quot;OpenData&quot; website about drugs... but it proved to be a website where documentation about drugs could be read online. It existed YEARS before, and it doesn&#x27;t become OpenData just because it&#x27;s hosted by the gov!
No raw data, no API: there will be no app which allows you to scan barcodes and tell you about conflicts between drugs, no app to prevent adverse effects depending on you health condition. No app I can imagine, no app you can imagine.
They just wasted our money for no added benefit.<p>I think they (France) do not understand what OpenData is.<p>Data does not become OpenData just because it&#x27;s accessible on the net. It&#x27;s OpenData if you can build something with it.<p>Think &quot;source code in PDF format on GitHub&quot; and you should agree that OpenSource and OpenData must be more than simply available online.",1383991928

(go (while true)
  (. js/console (log (<! clicks))))<p>And this yielded a compiler warning:
WARNING: Use of undeclared Var async-tut1.core/log at line 50 src/async_tut1/core.cljs<p>So there seems to be a problem with namespace resolution and the go macro?

6701241,comment,6618683,6618683,1,0,freedmanchair,,,"Hey Pallandt,<p>Apologies for the delayed reply.  Our Kickstarter launch has been nuts. The FreedMan Chair is a paradigm shift in sitting theory. Osteopathy in the Uk is a real medical science with a four-year full-time course and in the US the study results in Osteopaths being Doctors. I myself have been an osteopath for 26 years and have dedicated 18 years to the study of sitting ergonomics and chairs.  My Phd thesis at is &quot;We are not meant to sit&quot; and my PhD supervisor, an international authority on ergonomics and spinal research considers me one of the most knowledgable people in the world when it comes to sitting ergonomics.
I disagree about your idea that the best way to prevent back pain is to exercise. Sure exercise is great but there&#x27;s actually very little robust evidence to show the best way to do it to prevent low back pain.  This is a good paper to start with <a href=""http://www.backpaineurope.org/web/files/WG2_Guidelines.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.backpaineurope.org/web/files/WG2_Guidelines.pdf</a><p>To be honest I think The FreedMan Chair may well help you with your back problems. Someone could buy both a cheaper chair and an exercise bike too, but this seems a bit excessive.
I am working on a quadruple blinded randomised controlled trial of the chair, but this is a long and expensive process-we&#x27;ll get there. And, yes I&#x27;d agree that most of the claims other chairs make are nonsense.
Your bed and the chair you spend many hours sitting on should be the most expensive pieces of furniture you own.  You really do get what you pay for and this is the most sophisticated chair in the world...and considering that it&#x27;s reall not expensive.  I&#x27;ll get to cheaper versions but this is as cheap as we can get he first one.<p>This is a true, real-life disruptive technology.<p>I&#x27;ve dedicated 26 years of my life to looking after people and improving their lives. Sometimes people do things because they truly desire and believe they can make the world a better place.<p>Best wishes,<p>Simon",1383991774

The article pointed only to correlation. Such correlation doesn&#x27;t means causation, especially considering that the social context may be a direct result of inherent qualities (while inherent qualities may be only very indirect result of social context). This is why comparison with baseline where we _think_ inherent qualities play significant role is important.<p>If, for example, aristocracy like English lords started (or was significantly affected through such a process) as most successful fighters, and didn&#x27;t have significant gene mix with &quot;lower&quot; classes, when it would be very reasonably to suppose that their inherent qualities is somewhat different.",1383991365

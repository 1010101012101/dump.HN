Paradoxically, at the better resourced universities, the student has enough advisors and guidance that they&#x27;re often simply walked through their degree program without too much decision making on the student&#x27;s part.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of a friend of mine who went to a very nice private school and got her B.A., started her career and decided to go to school for her M.S. Except she went to the local state commuter university while she was working and simply couldn&#x27;t figure out how to navigate a system where the student was expected to figure out everything from their prerequesites to planning their class load and specialization - advisors were rare and hard to get a hold of.<p>She was simply overwhelmed by all this and really had lots of second thoughts about staying at the school. We talked about it and I asked her what he experience had been like at her undergrad. She said from day 1 she had basically always had an advisor of some sort to call upon to help her set her schedule and priorities, make sure degree requirements were being met, etc. And the advisor:student ratio was some ridiculously low number. I told her that at regular &#x27;ol state school, you have to buck up a bit and fend for yourself. It means you have to do extra work to figure things out, but you also can get more flexibility for your degree goals.<p>She ended up sticking it out, but I was kind of surprised at the struggle since I had just taken the lack of guidance for granted.",1407876512

I see:<p>> In a sense an axiom system is a way of giving constraints too: it doesn’t say that such-and-such an operator “is Nand”; it just says that the operator must satisfy certain constraints. And even for something like standard Peano arithmetic, we know from Gödel’s Theorem that we can never ultimately resolve the constraints–we can never nail down that the thing we denote by “+” in the axioms is the particular operation of ordinary integer addition. Of course, we can still prove plenty of theorems about “+”, and those are what we choose from for our report.<p>and:<p>> But there will inevitably be some limitations—resulting in fact from features of mathematics itself. For example, it won’t necessarily be easy to tell what theorem might apply to what, or even what theorems might be equivalent. Ultimately these are classic theoretically undecidable problems—and I suspect that they will often actually be difficult in practical cases too. And at the very least, all of them involve the same kind of basic process as automated theorem proving.<p>Are these what you mean?  Both of these seem to amount to, &quot;Sure, mathematicians <i>say</i> you can&#x27;t do it, but I hold out hope&quot;, an argument which is no more persuasive than one would expect to find from various circle-squarers.

8170022,comment,8168611,8169964,4,0,OrwellianChild,,,"I think it depends on the &quot;scummy, sabotage, and price-war tactics&quot; bit. If a well-funded Uber can out-spend and temporarily out-price Lyft into bankruptcy/acquisition, they might gain some leverage. That said, plenty of equilibria exist in other networked service-based markets. A good example would be UPS and FedEx, which provide remarkably similar service profiles to remarkably similar service areas.<p>The matchmaking part of the equation is low-cost on a per-transaction basis, and most of the risk and operational cost lies with the independent contractors (the drivers with their cars). This makes the services straightforward to run and scale, meaning there is no inherent reason why one or the other would be &quot;shut out&quot; of a market.<p>We may see this shake out one of multiple ways that could include the two operating at different levels of the market (Uber on limousines, Lyft on ride-share/cabs). There may also be additional tools/services from one of the companies that upsets the balance in a more sustainable way (e.g. facilitation of ride-shares, carpools, or other less ad-hoc trips like daily commutes). Lots of room for growth and expansion in this space.",1407875951

The yogurts are almost entirely &quot;no fat&quot;, which from a flavour perspective is awful; fat has been replaced with sugar, making it less healthy.

Gradually, but mostly four or so years ago, I decided I should learn some more, and started asking people and searching the net.<p>When I did this, I found learning about this to be a much more grueling process than it seems it should have been. In particular, I found some people (not all) who were more eager to belittle me for my ignorance than to simply to explain the problems that they have faced, or refer to me to some resource that would.<p>At the core I think that both of us agree: that it would be a very good thing if more people learned about racism, sexism, and related issues.

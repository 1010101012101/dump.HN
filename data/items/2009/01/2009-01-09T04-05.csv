Most people don't though, unless they are forced out, because of fear of the unknown or lack of a motivating factor.<p>Also, the distinction doesn't always have to be between management and workers. I would worry about the forward-looking health of the company if that dichotomy became a topic of conversation anywhere within. Employees are not stupid, and will realize when something besides the best future prospects of the company are motivating the cuts being made. Odds are there is a comparable amount of potential pruning to be done in the management ranks -- some people I've have read have argued even more potential. Not saying that is what is happening here, but it was just a thought that popped into my head while reading yours.<p>On the other hand, there is the perspective that, if cuts aren't made, the spirit of ""we're in this together"" doesn't matter so much anymore, because there is no more ""this"". It can be soul-crushing, but not as soul-crushing as shutting the whole company down instead.",1231477118

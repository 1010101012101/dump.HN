Finding simplified requirements is pretty difficult.<p>Your first link does indicate that the backlog for EB-3 category applications is 6-9 years.  So in that time you presumably must be working and wouldn't e.g. be able to start your own company (which is something I'd want to do by age 35), and you'd still be at the mercy of companies who know you're an emigrant so they can pay you less.  It doesn't look like you can apply for residency in the EB-2 category as a programmer unless a masters or above is a requirement for the job (i.e. Google is hiring you).<p>Overall the situation for older migrants is still not very good and while the US would be my first choice it still seems better to emigrate elsewhere or to wait until I'm more established and I qualify under a category with a much shorter backlog (after which it's another 5 years for naturalisation, whereas in other countries you're looking at 5-7 years TOTAL).<p>One serious potential problem:  apparently the old employer can revoke your I-140 (if you change companies) and you lose your priority date if that happens. [1]  Also all of this assume your sponsor is going to file the I-140 on your behalf.  What if they promise to do it and then don't?

First, the software (Convergence plugin and notary code) need to be stable. This is mainly the job for the project team, but they might need help. In my personal experience, the code works well; haven't checked recently to see how it performs for others. The Convergence plugin is a hack, so it probably has a few rough edges.<p>Second, the protocol and the code need to be independently reviewed. This hasn't happened as of yet, but I am sure will if the popularity of Convergence increases. I'd be willing to give it a go at some point.<p>Third, we need a good-enough infrastructure to start with. SSL Labs (which I run at Qualys) sponsors Convergence by providing 4 notary servers (2 in the US, 2 in Europe). These notaries are installed by default, so you could say that the infrastructure is decent (at the current level of usage).<p>Finally, we need to have the technology available in all major browsers, at the very least pre-installed and available as an option, but -- ideally -- fully integrated (""This looks like a self-signed certificate; please wait for a moment while we verify that you are not under an attack""). A big problem for adoption is that browsers are lacking APIs for this type of work.",1349005246

4592633,comment,4591002,4592501,2,0,tsotha,,,">In some respects they do: often government or insurers are left with costs. The insurers make their margin upstream of this, so there's low price pressure on the drug manufacturers.<p>But governments and insurers don't save money by saving your life.  They save money by letting you die before you get old.  That was the ironic thing about the tobacco settlements in the US - the states sued the federal government claiming damages for the extra care they had to provide to people who smoked, when those people would have cost the state more money if they'd lived a normal lifespan.<p>In some cases a new drug will save money by keeping some damaging disease from becoming a problem and pushing expensive treatments far into the future.  That's not the normal case, though.  I'm all for helping people live out their threescore and ten in good health, but on average it doesn't save anybody money.<p>>Also, demand for drugs is often inelastic, so people are more likely to make sacrifices here to pay for drugs. Which is fine in itself, but not when the high costs are the product of a cartel arrangement between government and industry.<p>Here again there has to be some way for the people doing development to recover their costs.  The patent system allows the drug company to charge more to every patient who takes a drug for twenty years.  Without it that would all have to be covered by tax money.  I like the patent system better, since it's biased toward charging people with lifestyle-related problems more money than people who take care of themselves.<p>Also, with the patent system companies will spend money on development for treatments that are within the realm of scientific possibility and not because advocates for that particular disease have more political clout.  How many billions were wasted in the ""war on cancer""?  Government just doesn't do this sort of thing very well.",1349004510

I was surprised to find, upon a close reading of the Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case,[1] that the Supreme Court held in that case that not only was an IQ test an illegal hiring requirement, in the circumstances of that case, but so was a high school diploma requirement. The usual headline description of that case mentions only the holding about the IQ tests, not the holding about school credentials. Either kind of requirement could be challenged by a rejected job applicant based on that Supreme Court precedent.<p>[1]<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a>",1382367212

As an employee, you get 6 weeks paid holiday, 5-8% of your salary in pension and you also get paid when you are ill. When you are contracting you get none of those things. A good rule of thumb is to deduct 20-25% of the contractor pay to reach comparable employee salary.<p>Still, 25% off 16K is 12K before tax.

Perhaps it&#x27;s time we reevaluated what college is supposed to be about.

I may post a follow-up based on the feedback I&#x27;ve received.<p>> Why not have the presentation be the specification, and we can just build the html to conform to the that specification instead<p>As I said, I don&#x27;t believe this is an appropriate approach for a medium which has no absolute, definitive interpretation. A website isn&#x27;t how it looks, because how it looks will differ depending on how you access it. The only absolute truth when talking about websites is the semantic purpose of the markup underlying it, because purpose is universal: a navigation element is a navigation element regardless of whether it&#x27;s being displayed on a TV, a desktop browser, a smartphone, or being read out by a screen reader.<p>> I imagine that&#x27;s just because you&#x27;d rather see better looking html than you would see better looking css.<p>I&#x27;m actually interested in both :)<p>> You have the semantic issues well thought out, however you are flat out declaring data semantics are more important than presentation semantics.<p>What are presentation semantics? I think this is a corruption of the concept of <i>semantics</i>. Semantics are what a thing is, or means, or does; not <i>how it is presented</i><p>> My CTO and designer (2 people I have a lot of respect for) were the people who eventually changed my mind on this. They said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why this button is blue, but it&#x27;s supposed to be green&quot;. Well it turns out it&#x27;s blue because it has the class blue on it. Instead of trying to figure out what selector was causing this button to be blue, all I had to do was remove the blue class and add the green class. It took 15 seconds.<p>Changing how you structure the CSS in your application based on the whims of people whose area of expertise isn&#x27;t CSS sounds like a nightmare scenario to me. If you&#x27;re bootstrapping with a small team I can understand wanting to have everyone being able to contribute, but you should also be able to recognise what the limitations of their skills are. In the example you give, I would be using my web developer tools / inspector etc. to find out the origin of the erroneous property. If you&#x27;re using a preprocessor there are source maps that can help with identifying how a rule was built. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t conclude it&#x27;s easier to use a presentational class name just so that my CTO could understand the code.",1382366348

Economics profs that are abusing their position to teach their personal policy preferences and conflating them with the science of economics are the kind of thing that gives economics, and the other social sciences, a bad name.<p>But, in any case, it is not <i>any kind of economic theory</i> (basic or otherwise), its a policy preference. Real economic theories deal with the behavior of economic systems, not preferences for how government should interact with them.<p>Obviously, real economic theories <i>combined with value assumptions</i> can inform policy preferences.<p>> I added my own comments on why we do tax capital gains<p>Which are also wrong, and seem to be an attempt to rationalize the crackpot &quot;theory&quot; from the class you TA&#x27;d with your misunderstanding of <i>how</i> capital gains are taxed (which seems to mistake the way <i>long-term</i> capital gains are taxed for how <i>all</i> capital gains are taxed.)<p>The real reason capital gains are taxed the way they are is because they viewed as income, so short-term capital gains (earned over a period of one year or less holding the asset) are taxed as normal income, and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate based on the observation that, in a system with progressive taxation on annual income, taxing income earned over a period longer than a year as normal income in the year the gains are realized would result in that income being overtaxed.<p>There&#x27;s also certainly a school of thought that capital gains should be taxed preferentially so as to encourage activities that produce capital income, from those who think that favoring those activities has desirable effects.  This seems to be far more common (among people in general, and economists in particular, than the crackpot &quot;capital gains aren&#x27;t income&quot; idea you taught), but, still, it isn&#x27;t an economic theory, its a political preference (and many notable economists disagree with it.)",1382366327

If so, why. If not, why?<p>* Why does the style guide for the site not specify this properly? (You have a style guide, right? Your CTO and designer did present you with an up-to-date, style guide, right?)<p>Asking these questions leads you to the semantic understanding of why buttons are supposed to exhibit specific characteristics. It&#x27;s the WHY that&#x27;s important, not the WHAT.<p>CSS excels when there&#x27;s a requirement for consistency in design, and there&#x27;s a style guide. When your requirements are a superficial &quot;this button must be green&quot; and you don&#x27;t stop to ask why, then you&#x27;ve already sacrificed the semantic aspects of the documents you are supposed to be vocal about.<p>Also, how difficult is it to find what stylerule is causing the button to be blue. Right click on the button, click &quot;Inspect this element in Firebug&quot;, in the CSS Inspector find the CSS rule that specifies the colour as blue. Look at the CSS selector itself - does it describe the semantic reason why the presentation is coloured blue? With that understanding of the semantic basis of the button being blue, you have an answer WHY the button is blue.<p>So now you need to understand why the button is supposed to be green. Get that explained to you, and now you have a good idea of the semantics you need to express, or reuse, a CSS rule that will cause the button to be rendered in Green.<p>This is where semantic class names win hands down, it tells you the WHY of styles. Without the WHY you don&#x27;t have a basis for explaining why the button is blue, and no clear inkling of why now it should be green.

6585773,comment,6564700,6568836,1,0,talmand,,,"Ah, so the only time to discuss a law is when it&#x27;s a bill before it is passed into a law. That&#x27;s interesting because I&#x27;m quite certain that is in no way how it works. Changes in laws are negotiated all the time. Sometimes willingly by Congress, sometimes forced to by the Supreme Court, and sometimes because the law itself was written to cause the occasional discussion about its own future. Sometimes a law is so badly written it just needs someone to stand up and say it is a bad law. There will be people will attack/defend the law to the last day simply because they have a vested interest in doing so. That&#x27;s politics.<p>But having the childish attitude of &quot;its the law of the land&quot; only works for one side as long as we&#x27;re talking about a law they support. As soon as the opposition pulls the same stunt then all of a sudden that&#x27;s not a proper defense of discussing problems with a law.<p>Now, to be clear, I did not support the stunt performed in the Senate. I understood the intention behind it but it was a lost cause before it even started. For one, no matter what happened the Republicans would get the blame for the shutdown because that&#x27;s always the outcome. The other reason being that the ACA was going forward despite what they would do. Notice how when the shutdown happened federal websites went down almost across the board? Notice how the ACA website was still up and running? Or it attempted to at least. Notice how they were arguing over funding the thing but it moved forward regardless? Interesting how they had to shut down parks that cost them next to nothing to run but could keep working on the ACA website that cost much more. That stunt in the Senate was a waste of time simply because it was going to go forward despite anything the Republicans did. The administration has already ignored rules, regulations, and laws in attempts to get it going, did anyone think that stupid stunt would somehow magically stop it?<p>As for the President&#x27;s &quot;I won&#x27;t negotiate&quot; while accusing the other side of not negotiating, which you seem to support this silly notion, was a mistake. Because one day the Republicans may gain control of the three branches of the government and make a &quot;law of the land&quot; that completely removes the ACA from the books. Will they be able to do so and the Democrats just sit idly by to do nothing? After all, when the Democrats have majority they behave as if the minority should sit down and shut up. &quot;We won&quot;, &quot;we have the majority&quot;. Those things work both ways. When the Democrats are the minority again, will they advise their members to do what they demanded of the previous minority? I don&#x27;t expect them to and, in a way, hope that they don&#x27;t. Regardless, we all know they will take that hypocritical stance. That is 110% politics.",1382365928

You are not measuring the skill you want with math problems, you are measuring a proxy.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;ve known plenty of smart math people that just never seemed to be able to program (well). I think they are different skill sets, certainly with plenty of overlap, but plenty of differences as well, and those differences matter. I laughed out loud at the &quot;variables, variables everywhere!&quot; answer in the OP - I&#x27;ve had to deal with so much code written that way. Some people, very smart people, just don&#x27;t &#x27;get&#x27; design in that way. I worked with a guy that used to run around the office, asking brain teasers, sharing tidbits of knowledge, but he couldn&#x27;t execute a basic project - couldn&#x27;t plan what to do, couldn&#x27;t do things in a rational order, couldn&#x27;t experiment and gather data, couldn&#x27;t incrementally design, develop, refactor, nor do a big-bang waterfall kind of design, and so on. He was not sorely missed when let go. Smart as a whip, and useless (for programming).<p>I&#x27;ve worked at several companies with staff mathematicians. Sooner or later they got their hands on a compiler. Oh my. No, let me do that. You tell me what is wrong with my Kalman filter, but I&#x27;ll take care of the implementation, thank you.<p>Its easy to kvetch at somebody else&#x27;s answer without offering an alternative (I do agree whiteboard progamming is disastrous). So, instead of asking math, why not ask them to write a simple routine, but then start asking real world problems about the code they would face - how would you make this API interface robust? What kind of documentation would you write. How would you handle errors? Is this code exception safe? Thread safe? How would you make it either/both of those. Suppose your problem size was n=100MM, how might you need to change this (say they have a data structure that loaded everything into memory)? Ask them some problems they will see in production - what is the network delay, or whatever your problem case is. You still get to see how they approach problems, but in the context of the actual decisions they will be making while programming for you.<p>Anyway, that is what I try to do. I am revising my thoughts even on that, because I find people flopping on the &#x27;code the simple problem (and, it is simple)&#x27; yet doing great on all the engineering questions, and doing fine if we hire them.",1382365779

As I&#x27;ve been working more with Ruby and Python over the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using and debugging more and more open source code. In the process, I&#x27;ve noticed how naming affects trying to work with and debug code in these languages. In general I&#x27;ve found it more difficult to jump in and figure out code written in ruby than python.<p>Part of this seems to be the grep-ability of identifiers. In the ruby community there seems to be more of a push towards constructing DSLs, which seems to cause developers to write more generic single word methods and variable names. Searching through a decent sized codebase tends to result in a lot of noise/reuse. In the python world, it seems that methods at least tend to be a little more verbose and more easily identifiable. Explicit imports in python do help quite a bit also.<p>Has anyone else noticed a similar pattern, or am I being biased here?",1382365236

I learned nothing of tech in either school, and I taught myself everything I know. (They wouldn&#x27;t let me take the classes I was already studying at home)<p>> And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don&#x27;t go on to Stem-related careers.<p>How many people actually get a career in what they got a degree? Probably half of the people I know do something different than what they studied in school.<p>--<p>This kind of article has me thinking more and more about assigned gender roles and societal expectations. A lot of people are really concerned with getting women into the tech industry. Years ago, people were probably really concerned with getting women into etiquette school, or getting them to learn a trade such as seamstress. How is our modern imposition of what a particular gender should do any different than the old impositions?<p>People claim to be pushing for these &quot;new&quot; gender roles as a way to fight inequality, or because women need help getting into the industry. But how necessary is it? For nerdy/geeky people who are really inspired and curious about the stuff, there is little stopping someone from learning online via tutorials and books geared towards beginners.<p>That said, I think there is an urgent need for more female-centric online help. The male-dominated chat, mailing lists and forums can be horrible for anyone to browse, though they&#x27;re particularly hostile towards women. But I don&#x27;t think this is an industry thing, I think this is a general cultural thing. Find American boys or men anonymously online and they&#x27;ll probably be doing some really horrible shit, a lot of it directed negatively towards women.<p>I think we all want a quick and easy fix, so we look at just the tech industry. We decide that we only want to fix our own little corner of the world and ignore the larger problem. But realistically, the lack of women in tech is probably a larger societal issue, and it won&#x27;t ever be resolved until you address the bigger picture.",1382365017

6585652,comment,6584628,6584628,4,0,NickLarsen,,,"Let me start by saying I am the most vocal person about semantic HTML at my company, but it really depends on your purpose, and I&#x27;m not sure you are realizing you are taking a hard line.  Also, I would have preferred you used the 90% of your words to give better examples of how to do things better than overstating how OOCSS and BEM are wrong.  Well developed solutions are always better than just explaining what&#x27;s wrong unless there is no solution and the existing proposals are wholly unsatisfactory.<p>Take a step back and realize that there is at least one more way of doing this.  Why not have the presentation be the specification, and we can just build the html to conform to the that specification instead (via the use of helpers and all other commonly accepted forms of duplication reduction).  Your post basically declares this Doing It Wrong, but I imagine that&#x27;s just because you&#x27;d rather see better looking html than you would see better looking css.<p>You have the semantic issues well thought out, however you are flat out declaring data semantics are more important than presentation semantics.  For most projects, the HTML is only used in a browser, and isn&#x27;t the source of truth for the application, i.e. it is inherently coupled with the presentation.  They might as well be one and the same because this is it&#x27;s only purpose in the world.  Leading from that, the only issue is maintainability, and here is where your ideas aren&#x27;t fully developed.<p>As will all separation of concerns, your solution (the one about breaking news) also adds a layer of misdirection.  Sure I don&#x27;t have to change the html to change the presentation, but now I have figure out where that part of the presentation is modified.  My CTO and designer (2 people I have a lot of respect for) were the people who eventually changed my mind on this.  They said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why this button is blue, but it&#x27;s supposed to be green&quot;.  Well it turns out it&#x27;s blue because it has the class blue on it.  Instead of trying to figure out what selector was causing this button to be blue, all I had to do was remove the blue class and add the green class.  It took 15 seconds.  It took probably 3 or 4 weeks for me to relent on this before I accepted, but it is much easier for everyone (think of the new hires as you pointed out!) if they don&#x27;t have to know tons of info about the domain, but just look for the offending element and make a simple change in place rather than have to unravel the css toolkit to find where my button was made blue instead of green.  Additionally, they know this change is only affecting this one element they were told to change.  On our team, that is better maintainability because that is how real changes are specified.  In your case, by the time this spec makes it&#x27;s way to the developer, it needs to have traveled through people who know that part of the web page is a breaking news container and translated from whatever the original complaint was or the developer will likely have another problem to figure out before he can even begin changing what will likely end up being a single css rule.<p>Loose coupling is simply about defining avenues of change, and it only improves maintainability when it enables making changes easier.  This has been extrapolated to mean &quot;does this have to change or not&quot;, which is over thinking it a bit.  In my example, I made a typical update by changing exactly one thing in exactly one place, without having to traverse any levels of misdirection.  Just figuring out how to make one thing not have to change doesn&#x27;t make it more maintainable.<p>When we&#x27;re talking about web pages, it&#x27;s also important to realize that we&#x27;re typically not changing just the presentation of static data; we&#x27;re adding and removing features to figure out what makes this page more useful.  The HTML is typically going to change anyway when we&#x27;re modifying the page, which again leans in favor of a common set of CSS selectors to build against (in terms of avenues of change).<p>As I said, I&#x27;m probably the most outspoken person at my office when it comes to semantic HTML, but it&#x27;s only when I&#x27;m describing actual data, i.e. the parts you read.  These parts tend to change very little and can be generated and stored in their already rendered state.  The parts that do change more often gain a lot from the benefits of OOCSS and BEM techniques.",1382364852

Then you&#x27;re allowed to turn off secure boot.<p>If they wanted it to be usable, they&#x27;d just offer me an option &#x27;boot once without secure boot&#x27; (and ask for the BIOS/EFI administrator password if set).<p>After this experience, my hypothesis is that the main purpose of &quot;secure boot&quot; is to discourage the user from installing anything non-default (aka Linux).",1382364637

I have a FingerWorks Touchstream LP that (while I don&#x27;t use it anymore) was performing the same exact gestures we all recognize as &quot;swipes&quot; on capacitive touchscreen phones/tablets.  As evidence I point you to the founder&#x27;s dissertation on the topic from 1999:  <a href=""http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~westerma/main.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~westerma/main.pdf</a><p>The only difference between how it worked on a Touchstream LP and a modern capacitive touchscreen is that the trouchscreen has a &quot;screen&quot;.  Other than that they&#x27;re absolutely identical.<p>Actually, the Touchstream LP had capabilities that exceed today&#x27;s capacitive touchscreens.  For example, it supports ten-finger chording and could recognize which finger was which.  So if I pressed my index and middle fingers (say, with both hands) in a certain region of the keyboard it would recognize that and send whatever pre-programmed sequence of keystrokes or mouse movements I wanted.<p>It was awesome technology!  It only had one (big) flaw though:  No tactile feedback.<p>You take it for granted but the &quot;click&quot; you feel when you press a key on your keyboard is very, very important to typing quickly and efficiently.  Without it you have to constantly ensure your hands & fingers in properly positioned.  This is why autocorrect is so important with software keyboards (if you&#x27;re tapping instead of swiping).  Without it--if you tried to type really quickly without thinking about what is actually being output from the IME--you&#x27;ll end up with typos all over the place.<p>Another thing we take for granted is the ability to &quot;feel&quot; a key as we press it.  On a capacitive touch surface there&#x27;s no way to do that without accidentally typing that key.  This is why I have high hopes for that technology that produces little bubbles on top of touchscreens on-demand to provide tactile feedback as to key locations.<p>So that is the reason why I eventually gave up on using the Touchstream LP.  While it was the greatest mousing device I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used HUNDREDS) it was not that great of a keyboard.  I&#x27;d be happy to use it day-to-day for typing up English words and sentences but it was just too error-prone to use in a bash shell or for programming.  Even with the &quot;programmer pad&quot; feature (which let you enter keys like braces, brackets, parens, etc using handy gestures) it still resulted in too many typing mistakes--even after training myself and using it regularly for a year.",1382364548

If you&#x27;re talking about the 100 Microsoft fans that upvote and comment all positive Microsoft stories on Reddit, HN and Verge - that doesn&#x27;t count. We&#x27;re talking about the market as a whole.<p>Also, even Microsoft themselves barely even promote the &quot;legacy app&quot; thing in their commercials. All they are showing is Metro. But if they think <i>Metro</i> is their tablets&#x27; competitive advantage, then why wouldn&#x27;t the consumer just get an iPad or Android tablet instead - and for a lot less?",1382364101

I know this is exactly what Lavabit did, but I feel Lavabit is an exception to the rule in this respect. I have no evidence either way, just my gut feeling.

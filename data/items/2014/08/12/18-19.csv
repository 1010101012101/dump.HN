8169500,comment,8168786,8169308,1,0,teamhappy,,,"&quot;There is no intrinsic reason why these numbers should not be proportional to society in the long run, that&#x27;s why we compare the ratios.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s true. Roughly proportional anyway. But there&#x27;s still gonna be minorities inside that group. I guess what I tried to say earlier is that making sure minoritie&#x27;s voices are heard is (IMHO) more important than making sure they&#x27;re represented proportionally to society. Simply because there&#x27;s always gonna be a minority.<p>&quot;[...] diversity as a thing in and of itself is at least good business. Especially in positions of power and decision-making.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t forget that huge groups like races, genders, etc. are incredibly diverse already. I guess a stereotypical example would be hiring a white man might diversify your staff more than hiring a black women if that man happens to be a vegan (or whatever). Or take the Fox News staff as an example if you like (they sure look diverse on mute). No argument on the second part though. Any representational entity (management, senate, etc.) should represent society accurately.<p>The rest of your post is a no-brainer. Talking to seemingly different people is always a good idea :)",1407869983

For example, a poll from just a couple of years ago reported that one in four women reports workplace sexual harassment[1].<p>It&#x27;d be much less worse if this was a tech industry problem only. The sad reality is that we&#x27;re knee-deep in shitty behavior.<p>And I want to stress, since some seem people to take the opposite of the charitable principle when reading posts, that this does not in any way excuse the tech industry.

Which means our economy is not as productive as it could be and we&#x27;re missing out on the increased opportunity for possible break throughs in software development and other related fields with similar bias.<p>It&#x27;s clearly a problem.

By backporting electric propulsion onto an existing SUV platform. Yeah, this is exactly the moment where this particular piece of journalistic spin comes crashing down.<p>The RAV4 EV was sold only in California precisely because it was a compliance car. Toyota simply decided it was cheaper to leverage their existing investment into Tesla to produce an EV on the cheap that could get them the required environmental credits so they could continue to sell their actual vehicles without having to buy the credits at a (at the time) large cost from other manufacturers. It was a simple localized business decision, not some grand strategy.<p>Of course Musk doesn&#x27;t just ridicule fuel cells, he affectionately calls them &quot;fool cells&quot;. As someone who builds his businesses by reasoning from first principles, he justifiably doesn&#x27;t understand the idea of swapping a 20% efficient (if you&#x27;re very lucky) combustion engine with a 10% efficient, experimental fuel cell when you could instead use a dead simple, clean and 80%+ efficient electric motor.",1407869699

Maybe it&#x27;s because having wealth melts ones brain, or maybe a certain level of sociopathy is advantageous in accumulating wealth. However the cause-and-effect works out, I struggle to imagine a person who exhibits such behaviors being fixable through sound reasoning.<p>The battle to get scummy dudes to behave appropriately feels in some ways like the battle to get thieves not to steal. You can tell a thief not to steal, you can describe to them how a victim feels when their house is broken into, but it just doesn&#x27;t register. A certain subset of the population lacks the empathy to respond to such appeals.<p>If the thieving analogy holds, the only way to fix someone like the masseuse would be to threaten punishment, but good luck creating/enforcing that.",1407869282

8169237,comment,8169102,8169102,11,0,chollida1,,,"Here is a very popular Quora question that details alot of the reasons why software estimates are wrong:<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Engineering-Management/Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3/answer/Michael-Wolfe?srid=u8eL&share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Engineering-Management/Why-are-software...</a><p>When I look back on my career the patterns that lead to good development were:<p>1) small team sizes, I&#x27;m a big believer that if version 1 of your product is developed by more than 4 people, its in trouble:)  Small, super focused, and highly talented teams make the best version 1 products in my opinion,  probably related to why some start ups can be more agile.<p>2) Everyone on the team has domain experience, ie its not the first time a product has been written.  This is slightly at odds with the &quot;second system syndrome&quot;.  At my current company, when we wrote our algo platform, each member had done this before so we knew from a data, networking, machine learning, and trader&#x27;s perspective what we wanted to get done.  There was very little flailing around trying to learn the domain( ie no learning what ml techniques to use, how to connect to exchanges via FIX, no learning what a pairs trade was, etc).<p>3) 1, and only 1 person in charge of the vision.  This might be obvious but debates, even when they are well intended, seem to slow things down.  Having one person dictate what the next version will have seems to make things much easier.  This is especially obvious in my current field of finance.  Its very easy to spot the products developed by engineers  for traders, vs the products developed by traders for traders,  The former have lots of features that no one wants  but they look pretty and the later, look ugly but make money:)<p><i></i>META NOTE TO ANYONE DEVELOPING A TRADING SYSTEM<i></i> No one cares what it looks like.  I&#x27;ll say that again, no one cares what it looks like.  The Bloomberg terminal is the ugliest thing on the planet and they mint money.  Function over fashion, always.  I&#x27;d go as far as to state that a small team developing a trading system having a designer is viewed in the same light as a small team having an mba.  That person might add value, but you&#x27;ll need to justify why you&#x27;re there instead of another engineer.<p>I think alot of not shipping can be tied to these three things, too large of a team, not knowing what the final product will be doing and hence alot of experimentation and wrong turns and competing visions, or a lack of vision of what you are building.",1407867401

Statistically, with even-odd tickets the net value of the ticket is always less than the ticket cost -- meaning statistically you loose money (ex: a $2 ticket, on average, has a return of $1.50).

7980040,comment,7977062,7979669,3,0,voyou,,,"I think the main difficulty in converting your example to a functional style is how to express the idea of a for loop which builds up a result as it goes along, without using a mutable variable to store this result. Here&#x27;s an attempt to explain how that the ideas in the parent are helpful in solving that problem.<p>You can think of the body of a for loop in python as the body of a function. In that case, a for loop is like the built-in map function, which applies that function to every element of the list. So convert your for loop into:<p><pre><code>  def body(email):\n    domain = email.split(&quot;@&quot;)[1]\n    if domain not in domains:\n        domains.append(domain)\n</code></pre>\nAnd instead of a for loop we can use the standard function, &#x27;map&#x27;.<p><pre><code>  domains = []\n  map(body, emails)\n</code></pre>\nNow, obviously the data here isn&#x27;t immutable. But what if, instead of changing &#x27;domains&#x27; every time the function is called, we passed in the current value of &#x27;domains&#x27;, and returned a changed value, like so:<p><pre><code>  def body(domains, email):\n    domain = email.split(&quot;@&quot;)[1]\n    if domain not in domains:\n        return domains + [domain]\n    else:\n      return domains\n</code></pre>\nThen, we could apply this function to each element of the list in turn, passing the current list of domains at each stage to the body. This is the standard function &#x27;reduce&#x27; in Python (which the parent calls by its other common name, &#x27;fold&#x27;):<p><pre><code>  domains = reduce(body, emails, [])\n   </code></pre>\nYou could think of &#x27;reduce&#x27; in python being implemented like:<p><pre><code>  def reduce(func, l, currentResult):\n    for item in list:\n      currentResult = func(currentResult, item)\n    return currentResult\n    </code></pre>\nOr, it could also be implemented recursively, which means it wouldn&#x27;t need to use mutation internally:<p><pre><code>  def reduce(func, l, currentValue):\n    if len(l) == 0:\n      return currentValue\n    else:\n      return reduce(func, l[1:], func(currentValue, l[0]))\n      </code></pre>\nMany for loops that build up a result can be expressed instead using &#x27;reduce&#x27;, so reduce is one of the most important building blocks of functional programming.",1404338325

It just doesn&#x27;t have the highest priority for us at the moment. We happily support any community effort to create additional build script engines.&quot;<p>I have looked at the Gradle source code and Groovy seems to be tightly entangled in it, and it would be difficult to get Gradle to use another DSL language. I&#x27;m also doubtful about what they say about happily supporting community effort to create other script engines. Based on my previous experience with the people behind Groovy, not only with regards to the Groovy++ fiasco of mid- to late-2011 but many times before, that line could easily mean &quot;We&#x27;re happy to hear about any community effort to create additional build script engines so we can scuttle your attempt before it gets very far.&quot;<p>> The simplicity of its syntax vs scala is a great point for Groovy though<p>Did you say Groovy&#x27;s syntax is simple? The Gradle DSL is just a tiny subset of Groovy&#x27;s grammar, see [1]. It&#x27;s also still stuck on Antlr 2 because no-one wants to try upgrading it to Antlr 4. Scala was designed so its grammar would be light and the functionality residing in the libraries.<p>[1] <a href=""http://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/eclipse/trunk/base/org.codehaus.groovy18/src/org/codehaus/groovy/antlr/groovy.g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/eclipse/trunk/base/org.codeha...</a>",1404338270

7979976,comment,7977188,7977188,12,0,anondog,,,"> Did you get &quot;never have to work again rich&quot; through software?<p>It feels pretty stupid to reply to this as a &quot;no&quot;, but to offset the incredibly depressing stories of random luck success, I figured I&#x27;d go ahead with it anyway.<p>No, I&#x27;m not rich. I&#x27;m 33 and dead broke, actually.<p>> How did you do it?<p>I started my first company (a video-related SaaS B2B product) at age 22 and it should have been a home run. The idea and timing were perfect and I found product-market fit almost immediately, cold-calling my way to paying customers 10 months after quitting my previous job.<p>But I fucked it up. I was too young. My engineering was shitty (wasted all my time putting out fires), but more damningly, I tried to grow the business organically. I&#x27;d never been exposed to &quot;real&quot; entrepreneurship before and didn&#x27;t know anything about venture funding. By the time I realized I needed to raise money (and actually going as far as signing a $1M+ term sheet with a group of shitty investors), it was already too late.<p>The old guard companies in the space I set out to bankrupt did, indeed, go bankrupt, but it was another startup with the same idea and technology as mine that put the screws to them. While I was trying to turn a profit and make payroll, these other startups just passed me by like I was standing still.<p>>What did it feel like when you first realised it was going to be true that you would never have to work again if you didn&#x27;t want to?<p>Re-interpreted as &quot;what did it feel like when success slipped through your fingers?&quot;<p>The business was doomed by 2006, but I &quot;stuck with it&quot; (following bad advice) and pivoted (more bad advice) until 2010 when I finally gave up. I wasn&#x27;t exposed to the concept of failing fast until later.<p>There was no real moment in time I knew the dream was over, but I fell into a deep depression. Thinking funding was imminent, I&#x27;d borrowed money and found myself $75k in debt after all the work and sacrifice.<p>I finally pulled myself out of the depression and was able to pay back <i>most</i> of my debt within 2 years of being in the &quot;working world&quot;.<p>> How old were you?<p>Company started at 22, on life support by 27, ended at 30. 2 jobs and 2-3 more startup attempts since then (one was a pivot, really). Now I&#x27;m 34.<p>> What was it specifically that made the cash that ended up in your pocket?<p>Like I said, I found product-market fit. Had I executed properly, as my competitors did, I&#x27;d be a multi-millionaire today.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to start 3 more companies since then, each better engineered and executed than the last, but none of them found the beginner&#x27;s luck &quot;fit&quot; of the first.<p>What was different about the first? I experienced a pain point first hand in an obscure occupation. I don&#x27;t want to get into specifics, but my first job out of college was as a peon in a non-tech industry. I saw a glaring inefficiency in one of the business processes and knew I could fix it with software.<p>Of my 3 product/usiness attempts since then, 2 solved problems I perceived from outside an industry that weren&#x27;t really that problematic after all and 1 was/is a consumer product. For the consumer product, the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve is really a problem, but it&#x27;s visible to many, many more people.<p>When you have a unique vantage point on an obscure problem, your chances of being the guy to solve it are much better.<p>> Do you feel happy in your life?<p>No. It gets really dark sometimes.<p>When I was running my first company, I was energetic and blissfully self-confident. Now I&#x27;m a heap of bitter frustration and anxiety with crippling sleep problems.<p>After I finally gave up pivoting and &quot;persevering&quot; on that first business, I had a 2-year &quot;working world&quot; tenure that was so painful I can&#x27;t even talk about it under an anon account.<p>Entrepreneurship courses through my veins and I can&#x27;t turn it off. But I&#x27;ve gone through my Rolodex of acquaintances a thousand times and can&#x27;t find a viable co-founder for a new business. No cofounder = no accelerator = constantly stuck in neutral. The thought of going back to a cube job makes me break out into a sweat -- literally. (Echoing an above poster.)<p>All I can do at this point is try to start new businesses on my own and get traction like I did the first time. There is no other viable path for me.<p>TL;DR I was a 22-year-old wunderkind whose company crashed, career melted and am now a 34-year-old has-been.<p>---------<p>Epilogue: A friend of mine went to a state university and applied to his dream job at Microsoft upon graduating. He got rejected and ended up taking a position at his backup, Google... in 2002. Made a boatload (but not retirement money) in the IPO, was heavily recruited by the most hyped startup of the late 2000s (he admitted it was only because of the Google name), and is now an angel investor.<p>Life is fucked up and random, my friends.

I recall this &quot;playing to win&quot; essay, talking about Street Fighter.  (If characters punching each other to unconsciousness is not violent, I don&#x27;t know what is.)<p>In fighting games, competitive players tend to concentrate on the structure <i>behind</i> punches and suffering.  They see a game of anticipation, dexterity, and timing.  They talk about hit boxes, priorities, frame advantage…  Those players would probably enjoy an abstract version of those fighting games.<p>Hmm… we could even test that: could we make a game that have a similar structure to Mortal Kombat, only it doesn&#x27;t even look like 2 characters punching each other to death?",1404337236

7979914,comment,7978599,7979517,3,0,chipsy,,,"I think the key is in whether these languages get the backing of a Big Institution. Tech people are simultaneously sensitive and oblivious to the political nature of what technologies interest them: For example, all the coverage of Swift is because Apple is backing it. All the coverage of Go is because it has some famous people behind it plus the tacit support of Google. All the coverage of Rust is because it&#x27;s backed by Mozilla. But when asked directly about their interest most coders will proclaim that it&#x27;s simply because the technology in these things is better, even though there were plenty of languages that had similar features and implementation quality beforehand. Nobody - especially not people caught within the politics of their own company - has the time or depth of experience to be completely confident about what they would need from a new language and why, so social signalling and appeal to authority tends to rule the day: &quot;No one ever got fired for buying IBM.&quot; And so, intentionally or no, people come out of the woodwork to position themselves as early adopters of the &quot;next IBM.&quot;<p>That said, in the long run I think the APIs and tooling experience matters. Free Pascal basically hangs on because Delphi did so well as a third-party environment, even though it was always marginalized on Windows for not being a Microsoft-anointed language. But the Delphi experience was related to the era of the Windows desktop application, and when the market&#x27;s interest moved away from that the magic was kind of lost. Ada likewise has hung on because it has that gov/mil influence behind it - and its ecosystem is still mostly centered around commercial development environments.",1404337076

Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed?&quot;</i> [1]<p>Mistakes are human and they happen. It should be the responsibility of our nation&#x27;s immigration officials to help people through the inevitable difficulties and mistakes that happen in a system as complex and Byzantine as our immigration system.

As such, the default suspicion of any non-citizen and &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; attitude the OP describes is not surprising.<p>Even if whatever mistake she made is a critical one that should prevent her entry into the US until it is resolved, I cannot see any justification for deporting her and forbidding her from reentering for 18 months.<p>When people try to live and work as productive and positive individuals in the US and our legal system actively treats them in a hostile and suspicious manner, justifying it by a minor clerical mistake [2], we have a duty as citizens to recognize the real problem and work to correct it.<p>I find it ironic that in an earlier age we (as a country) ridiculed the &quot;papers please&quot; culture of Soviet Russia and assumed that we (as freedom loving Americans) could never become such a country.<p>[1] Federalist #62<p>[2] A visa is a piece of paperwork.

You have to explain that Time is implicit in the code, and that an equal sign works by making the thing on the left equal to what the thing on the right was just before this line.

They&#x27;re not ignorant of how they use it--they use their privacy settings to hide posts from the public.<p>However Facebook&#x27;s ToS says [0] Facebook may use any information you share with them &quot;to protect Facebook&#x27;s or others&#x27; rights or property&quot;.  So hypothetically, if Facebook felt some policy of a presidential candidate threatened &quot;Facebook&#x27;s rights&quot;, they would be in the clear, legally speaking, to publish those photos of you smoking a joint at 18.<p>So what is the difference exactly between Facebook publishing a photo of a joint and an old Guardian article?  They are both expressions of speech.  They are both things that the public arguably has a right to know.  They are both cases where there is no legal impediment to the speech--other than, in your words, the &quot;right to censor criticism or true facts about yourself.&quot;  On what basis can we say one is allowed and not the other?  I cannot generate a reason for analyzing these situations differently, although I very much want to.  I suggest we have to either allow both, or forbid both.<p>This analysis would suggest that free speech and privacy have a very fundamental conflict--that the gain of one comes at the expense of the other.  Increasingly, the right to privacy is really the right to prevent others from publishing information about you that they lawfully and ordinarily collect.  I grow increasingly doubtful that we can achieve both outcomes--I think at some point we will have to choose sides.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#howweuse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#howweuse</a>",1404335663

I&#x27;m also not trying to encourage unchecked language proliferation; you can get by with one language for applications, one language for scripting, and, if necessary, one language for all the lower-level stuff.",1404334907

Beyond that, if we&#x27;re talking about writing user space type applications, can someone point to some that need something particularly C like?  There is a whole ton of C code that could easily be done in C, Rust, or go with relatively little downside.  Not too many weeks ago someone posted linux coreutils in Rust and someone else posted coreutils in go.  I&#x27;d be hard pressed to make the case for C over either of those,  perhaps raw cycles performance is incrementally better.",1404334889

So, rather than evolving a CS curriculum, another option would be to introduce parallel software engineering programs. Honestly though, for a professional developer who sees this as a career, I&#x27;d argue you are better off doing CS at the undergrad level, then pursuing something like a Masters in Software Engineering. CS at the undergrad level gives everyone the foundation they need, regardless of what the pursue professionally after that.",1404334831

6112483,comment,6111718,6112315,3,0,Joeri,,,"My opinion is that if you&#x27;re going the rdbms route, you should keep everything on a single instance (mirrored to a hot backup ofcourse). As soon as you start managing a menagerie of servers with intricate programming logic to shuffle data back and forth, the nosql solutions will be a better fit. So, for any rdbms i would advise using it where it can handle the load on one instance, or possibly a few with a very simplistic sharding model (e.g. we never shard the schema, but we do host different customers on different oracle instances, without any data shared across customers).<p>I haven&#x27;t worked enough with postgres to know what loads it can handle, but i&#x27;m sure there are plenty of cases where a single instance is just fine.",1374922650

But how will you know what repairs are required (do you ask the <i>roofer</i> if this is a patch job, or if a new roof is needed)?  How do you know what a given repair or renovation should reasonably cost?  How do you find trustworthy contractors?  The ones everyone recommends will be busy through next year, more or less, and the unknowns are exactly that.<p>What tasks can you reasonably do yourself (without experience) as opposed to hiring someone?  I.e., shower grout, replacing a light fixture, installing a dishwasher/stove, installing shelving, replacing a door lock, putting weather stripping around windows, small painting jobs, etc..<p>My wife & I had a few years with significantly lower income.  If we had been renting, we would have rented a cheaper place for those years.  But we own a house -- so we basically just spent a few years unable to afford to maintain it properly.<p>More recently, we now have kids and have been thinking of leaving the area entirely -- moving to a different city, or possibly leaving the country.<p>But to sell or rent the house, we should finish renovation/repairs first.  And the selling market isn&#x27;t great now, but becoming a landlord -- especially remotely -- would require a whole new set of skills.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a hell of a lot (mostly through error) over these years, but these are not all skills I have wanted to learn, or how I&#x27;ve wanted to spend my time; the fact of buying the house forced an awful lot of experiences after it.<p>If you rent, you pay someone else to handle all that.  If they do a poor job, you look for a better place (and it&#x27;s not fun to find a new place and move, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal).",1374922338

Most things I did made between $5k-$10k / month and so sold for a nice amount. With that money I bought a house.

6112403,comment,6112174,6112378,2,0,mrbuzer,,,"We can talk about the psychological factors or we can simply tell it the way it is which is that economic growth increases the need for energy. Most production of energy and production of things cause by-products that are not a natural part of the system, in another words pollution. Pollution interferes with the natural functioning of the system. If we did not need to support such a large population or economic growth we would not be creating all this pollution. Therefore we could as a species inhabit the planet much longer (there are obviously natural sources of pollution that work on much longer time scales). Because we don&#x27;t act responsibly and instead of taming our psychology we have let it loose on the world in the name of economic growth (and power of the current ruling elite) we will as a matter of course cause more and more pollution which will at some point start reducing the carrying capacity of the planet which will lead to smaller and smaller population until our species goes extinct. That&#x27;s the natural course of humanity. Many people believe that more technology will save us, but is life really worth living being hooked up to a respirator with a miserable polluted planet barely capable of supporting life? Many people in the third world seem to think so, they keep producing even more misery.",1374919715

If indeed the CO2 levels being produced are more than consumption then where are the plants getting their energy from? And don&#x27;t say animals, because if that was the case then the animals would have to be eating more and more of the forests. The only case I can see is wide scale felling, but then wide scale felling is not a case of plants producing more CO2.<p>CO2 levels are a problem, but this short description of this report seems to be muddying the waters not making them more clear.",1374919441

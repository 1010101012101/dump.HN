312094,comment,305987,306208,0,0,jbasdf,,,"We're currently working on building a community around Luvfoo.  So far we have a few guys from around the world helping us out.  I estimate that we are about a month away from having something that is easy for 3rd parties to deploy.  Right now the project is centered around Teachers Without Borders as they are providing funding for the project.  However, there is a need to make it easy to deploy the same system for other groups and so that is a focus.  Now to be fair I have met the guys behind Elgg.  Both of them are very smart and great guys.  I think that project is still in development.  Wordpress is working on a social networking project called buddypress which looks very promising.  If you want something fast it is hard to beat Ning (but it is a hosted service).  In the Rails world Acts as Community looks like a great project.  Best of luck in your choice.  There is a lot of really great open source software out there.",1222145953

312085,comment,311767,311767,0,0,harshavr,,,"On the whole macro debate, whatever one thinks the default behavior should be with respect to variable capture, the syntax-case macro system in scheme works on a representation of program code which is at a higher resolution than what lisp macros works on.<p>The macro can find out for instance, if an identifier used in its input is a free-variable, or if two identifiers share the same binding.
 Hence, it is possible to write a relatively short program to define defmacro in terms of define-syntax & syntax-case, but not the other way round.  (a pretty short implementation & most of it is error checking -  <a href=""http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/trunk/collects/mzlib/defmacro.ss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/trunk/collects/mzlib/defmacro....</a>)<p>This also strikes me as a inconsistency in arc(albeit easily correctable), as it goes against the rule of not imposing restrictions on the user, by default. Even, if the default macro interface is something simple, the user should be able to write macros which work with syntax at a higher resolution if needed.<p>Also, if you use the most popular distribution, PLT scheme, you have all of reader macros, native hash tables, keyword arguments, a package repository. There is a really nice module system, along with other neat stuff like contracts, lazy modules, frp & of course the continuation based web-server.  For OOP, there is Swindle, an analog of CLOS(not having used it, i don't know if it's just as good).<p>After R6Rs, there is a common module system and standard libraries for hash-tables even in the scheme spec.<p>The main flaw, it seems, is the relative lack of libraries as compared to other mainstream languages.
In particular, what i miss is something like wxPython for scheme.<p>EDIT : turns out i spoke too soon, defmacro does have an environment object(<a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_aad.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_aad...</a>) as a parameter, so it has some access to lexical info of its input form. To implement define-syntax, one would also need some way to output a syntax object and not just a s-expr. Couldn't find any defmacro  implementation of define-syntax on the net.",1222145402

312080,comment,311122,311937,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Sorry about the unwarranted criticism. I think that one annoyance was that the titles presented programming in a way that someone would present video game cheat codes or easter eggs, when they were (of course) nothing of the sort. I realize that those were the original titles and you can't really be blamed for that; it is a reflection of the current population of stackoverflow, though, and is one example of why I don't exactly rate its submissions highly.<p>I am also sorry that I made a false assumption about the reason for the submissions, especially since that is what bothered me the most. I had assumed that you were a ""loyal"" member of stackoverflow and were trying to encourage us to join in on the discussion over there, which seems somewhat counterproductive as far as the community here is concerned. Coupled with the numerous stackoverflow comments I've seen to the effect of, ""If something is wrong, why don't you go fix it?"" (also not your fault), it just touched a nerve I guess.<p>I applaud your efforts to improve the community and to help shift it away from its recent politics/economics trend. As you can see from the link you gave, I submitted an article today, too, so I am in the same boat that you are (in terms of trying to improve the HN community). I am not much of a blog reader and don't often have much of value to submit, but since I did today and I had improving HN on my mind, I was glad to have something to contribute. I am certainly grateful for members like you who get the ball rolling with many good contributions, I just get disappointed when I feel that the community is overvaluing a submission without a lot of substance. (For example, I liked your ""PHP vs. Lisp?"" submission, however slanted it was, better than the stackoverflow ones.)<p>Also, I realize that your link was mostly a swipe at my lack of submissions, but that does not mean that I am not an active, contributing member. Nearly all of my 800+ karma has come from commenting, and I feel that buried in there are some gems with useful personal experiences, educated opinions, etc. In addition to that, I spend a decent amount of time lurking... reading submissions and voting them up if I feel they are ""Hacker News""-worthy, reading countless comments and voting up/down based on my opinion of their value to me and to the community as a whole, and heading over to the ""new"" page when I have some time to kill.<p>Surely there is something to be said for members who contribute not as a primary filter (initial submitter) but as a secondary filter (up/down-voter who reads and votes on the submissions and comments) or as a commentator, adding insights to the discussion provoked by the article. After all, many of us are here at Hacker News for not only the low signal-to-noise ratio but also the unparalleled quality of discussion, and there are many non-submitting members who are doing this work behind the scenes without a lot of recognition.",1222145177

That's between 2 and 3 dollars a meal, which is about right for something made from farmers market grade ingredients.<p>However, for 100 dollars I could probably order out to a set of restaurants to eat for a week. (5 orders of 2 dishes each, should be 20 per an order. That leaves me with 10 restaurant meals which would be about as much food as 12-15 meals from his cook, I suspect).

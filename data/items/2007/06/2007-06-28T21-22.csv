I was happy to put up with the taste difference thinking I'd get used to it.  However, by the end of the week I realised my consumption had more than doubled and concluded it was because I was in search of the caffeine so reverted.  (I do tend to open a can and sip it over a couple of hours normally.)",1183067761

31478,comment,31378,31412,0,0,ralph,,,"You could be right about the palette.  Mine's pretty poor in terms of being a <i>bon viveur</i> but I was one of those annoyingly fussy eaters as a kid.  However, perhaps more relevant is that I've lived in a household for some years where one member is sensitive to various airborne chemicals.  Consequently, the house is kept relatively free of them, e.g. few new items, or new items are off-gassed for a while before moving into the main living areas.<p>Sounds crackpot, I know, but the end result has been to make me detect these now unusual items, e.g. if a newspaper is somewhere in this area of the house.  I guess my tolerence levels have come down as my exposure has dropped.  There's an awful lot of crap floating around these days.  Perhaps that's why country folk visiting the city can take a dislike;  ""All the noise and commotion gave me a headache"".  Or what they breathed in?<p>Good idea to give up drinking the stuff.  I'd like to but find it hard to drop the caffeine first thing in the morning.  Coffee's too much of a kick and more of a slippery slope.",1183067516

31473,comment,31457,31457,0,0,enriketuned,,,"A monologue between me and G. <p>Yes I agree you do some cool stuff, and I applaude you for what you have achieved, but you really start to get on my nerves. The reason I am posting this here is: I had such high hopes for you to be a different kind of corporation. - to be able to make the transition from cool startup to cool company. - not to be evil ;-). That's not how I see you now.<p>First of all, how and why does a company that was started by two guys without a PhD so strongly favorise PhDs when it comes to the recruitement for all research and other ""cool"" positions. I am halfway through on my own PhD in CS, and  honestly I just don't see your point. I mean a PhD is not a magical transformation into a creativity boasting super- hack-thing. Au contraire, I wonder how you are able to keep your engine running with so many PhDs around. There is some truth to the stereotype of the slightly mad and sometimes overly complicated CS academic person. I experience that daily. And then statements like: ""We want to hire people who are smarter than those already working for us"". Just hire people that have amazing skills, are cool, and enthusiastic. That's what you were built on. Please don't just look at GPA and titles.<p>Second and that applies not only to you but to all search engine companies, please stop giving us the impression that you know what's going on with your algorithm. Come on there are billions of documents on the Web - and you have an algorithm that ranks those according to millions of different queries. So please tell me - how do you figure out if your algorithm is doing it's job? How? It's all educated guessing. Nothing more. <p>Third, please G get over it with the ""Do not be evil thing"". AOL might have had an employee unfortunately release a dataset, but at least they allow you to delete all your personal data. While you do not, and boast about   anonymizing our data after several years. And yes you censor in China, and I also remember the story about your employee who you fired for blogging that you are actually not as cool as he imagined you. Yahoo and MS do stuff like this too, but at least they don't pretend to be saints.<p>And fourth. Please your marketing hype about being different, being still like a startup - you overplay it. You going green, and the sudden popularity of that - a mere coincidence? And yes - sue microsoft for being monopolistic - but at the same time acquire doubleclick and argue it's ok?<p>Ah, dear G. it might just be that I worked too much and yes I only slept 6 hours in the last three days. Dear G. above all - just stop pretending to be something else.

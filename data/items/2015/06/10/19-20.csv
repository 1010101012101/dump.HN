However, the concept of version control is incredibly powerful—anyone who utilizes it has a huge advantage in productivity. Perhaps O&#x27;Reilly would be better off providing a more simplified system (perhaps even a simple GUI on top of git, offering a small subset of functionality), but I can see why they insist on a VCS-based workflow.",1433966383

But I was a bit annoyed by little things that I think are inexact:<p>- the &quot;one-process-per-request&quot; meme along the post applies only to some ruby app servers (there are event loop and threaded models too, think thin, puma, passenger in some modes) and I guess reading between the lines that it&#x27;s mostly a problem of thread-safety and async support, because of the gems Parse used to have, right? I&#x27;m sure that limits options at some point anyway, but the statement is misleading and not really explained, I&#x27;d love to hear more details<p>- I don&#x27;t understand how the comments in the little Go file snippet applies in any way to &quot;ruby&quot; ; it may be rails caching mechanisms, or a specific gem, but I have a hard time mapping those very specific details to something intristic to ruby, it seems more like grumpy ruby bashing, like you&#x27;d have done php bashing 5 years ago<p>As all rewrite stories, I think there&#x27;s a part of envy/excitement over the new cool tech you want to use (and that&#x27;s fair! pleasure give you huge productivity boosts), and also a part of success related to the fact you <i>know</i> the kind of things you failed in the first version, so you won&#x27;t make the same mistakes the 2nd time.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear finer details on those points!

This writes <val> to program slot BAK and adds one to BAK. Each node starts with its program memory full of PROGRAM ANY and starts with BAK=0. To program a node, simply send the program to it, one word at a time. When the program counter wraps round, your program runs.<p>To initialise the network, have a serial EPROM connected to a fake I/O node. After startup, the contents of the ROM gets sent, one word at a time, on the I/O node&#x27;s port. This programs the node it&#x27;s attached to, which starts running; this then forwards messages on to the next node, which gets initialised and starts running, etc. That way you&#x27;d fill the network with message-forwarding programs. Once done, each node starting at the most remote would be overwritten with your real program, and once the root node gets overwritten initialisation is complete.",1433966030

One is helping people cook and get comfortable and have fun with that, and the other is based on the new food science of temperature. This is most commonly known today as sous vide and implemented with an immersion circulator. The food quality really is 10x better, for example you can keep meat proteins below the temperature they seize up and push out moisture, and the experience is something you can&#x27;t go back to normal cooking from. Because the food doesn&#x27;t overcook* you have an hour of flexibility, if you love cooking you can use this to try more complex sides and time it right. If you&#x27;re busy, you can stay calm when your spouse is 30 minutes late. It&#x27;s like when the DVR came around and you could pause live TV, and no one could go back. Cinder takes advantage of precision temperature cooking to let you do these things, and unlocks other kinds of unattended cooking. You can set onions to a caramelization temperature and walk away, yes you could replicate that yourself if you wanted to hover and stir for 30 minutes, but this is like delegating to a sous chef.<p>*This is a slight simplification. Food will break down and turn mushy, but nearly everything has an expanded range for being done. Which means ending the tyranny of the clock.",1433965575

Climate science is a diverse and huge field with many research areas that existed long before our awareness of climate change, and researchers&#x27; careers do not depend on the current climate change consensus- it&#x27;s not like every university would simply fire their Earth Sciences department, or the NSF would stop funding Earth Science grants, if the climate was not warming. Additionally, you don&#x27;t seem to understand how the grant process works- grants are awarded before results are obtained, chosen by committees of scientists, and a majority of climate science grants do not even write proposals concerned with future predictions. Finally, the irony is of course, the handful of denialist scientists are the only people who have been explicitly (and universally) linked to outside conflict of interest funding in their work.<p>Al Gore did not &quot;help invent&quot; any part of climate science, he merely brought popular attention to the issue.<p>Your failure boils down to the following: you have no perspective of the magnitude, operations, or workings of the scientific community.

I strongly support both technological (nuclear and solar/storage) and political (carbon tax/tariff) approaches to ACC, but as a computational physicist I can&#x27;t deny that climate models being predictively accurate--especially at the scale of these predictions--would be close to miraculous.<p>This is not a political position, it is an expert&#x27;s evaluation after having looked at the code and documentation for some of the better models. You simply can&#x27;t parameterize away as much of the physics as they do, or impose conservation conditions by hand the way they do, and expect a long-term integration to produce anything but the crudest approximation to reality.<p>System-wide averages are likely accurate in terms of scale. That is, global heat content is increasing at the order of 1 W/m<i></i>2, probably not 0.1E-2 W/m<i></i>2 and certainly not 10 W/m<i></i>2. This is important, because 1 W/m<i></i>2 is consistent with observtions and likely problematic in terms of local climate. The global economy is heavily optimized to the current climate, and even relatively modest changes would turn trillions of dollars of investment into malinvestment. This is a bad thing, if you care about global capitalism.<p>Climate scientists are not computational physicists. They have not spent most of their careers modelling systems that are ultimately subject to laboratory testing, and as such they have not seen their best laid plans gang aft agley.<p>I have long wondered how much of the hubris in climate prediction was coming from the policy level and how much was coming from the scientists themselves. This release suggests that it really is coming from the scientists, and that&#x27;s unfortunate. Twenty years from now most of these predictions will prove to be false. That falsity will be in all directions: some will have temperatures or rainfalls far too low, some far too high. And the enemies of science will use that to further attack us.<p>Unfortunately, when I stand up and say this, I get attacked as an enemy of science by people who think they love science, but who are actually drawn to it simply as a useful stick with which to beat their political opponents.",1433964890

MD5 is by far the fastest of the common hashes, at least 20% faster than SHA1 for example.<p>The Venn diagram is you&#x27;ve got popular fast hashes, of which md5 is arguably the best, and in fast hashes, you&#x27;ve got cryptographically secure fast hashes, of which md5 most certainly is no longer a member.  Its awesome for everything non-crypto non-secure non-over the internet.<p>Last weekend I had to burn a legacy DVD and I compared the md5sum of the image to the md5sum of the burned DVD, thankfully they matched.  As much as I distrust legacy media, there probably isn&#x27;t a sentient opponent in the burner, although I&#x27;ve occasionally sworn otherwise, and the most likely failure mode would have been simple truncation or buffer dropouts, so sheer speed was the priority.  The hashes obviously matched, it was a good burn.<p>I&#x27;ve also used them as checksums for engineering data files.  Everything on the planet from AS400s to MySQL databases can calculate md5, which is convenient for cross platform interchange type stuff.  Heres a data blob and its md5, does your hash calculation match?  Oh it does, how nice to know you have perfect data integrity, here have the next one.  On the internet I wouldn&#x27;t trust the opfor with md5, but I can trust my own coworkers and my own engineering machinery not to try and attack me (well, probably).<p>That means until the end of time you&#x27;ll unfortunately have people discover md5 is available for non-crypto use, then try to use it to hash passwords or DRM executables or something, which is not so wise.  Or for a downgrade attack, they misdesign their crypto system to allow any hash installed on the machine as the hash type and not blacklist md5 and sha1 and maybe more.<p>What will die out is hashes like SHA1.  Why use something almost as dangerous as md5 for crypto, thats slower than md5, and not as widespread as md5?  Bye bye sha1!",1433964367

The four problems they called out:<p>1) Scaling<p>2) Crontab editing<p>3) Job status<p>4) Job restarting.<p>In my experience, the scaling issue is solved by having multiple machines which can run jobs. Assuming that the job doesn&#x27;t have to be tied to a particular machine (DB backups have to be on the machine with the database of course, but a log gathering and analyzing job can run on any machine with network connectivity. They seem to have done that part by creating a new class of machine called a &#x27;taskworker&#x27;. Presumably they could distribute their crontabs to all of those machines and have a limiter that says &quot;don&#x27;t run if you&#x27;re IP is divisible by 2 or 3 or 4 or what ever scaling factor. More on this in a bit.<p>And that brings the editing question of cron tabs up, which is abhorrent with a text editor but pretty trivial with any number of &#x27;helper&#x27; apps.<p>Then 3, and 4, of status and restarting. Which I have always &quot;wrapped&quot; cron jobs in a simple unified shell script that logged their start, accepted progress outputs, and then provided status, without generating output to stdout so as to avoid needless emails. You only get email is the wrapper breaks, which is a big deal for ops to deal with right away.<p>Additionally the wrapper can work with distribution since you can provide it &#x27;rule&#x27; based run/don&#x27;t run heuristics (like if this machine has the resources for this job yes/no, is it the &#x27;nth&#x27; machine (if distributing across n machines) etc.<p>So for me the typical cron &quot;deployment&quot; is a wrapper for the deployment that encapsulates the various policies (distribution, frequency, etc) a crontab that is compiled and validated from a more human friendly input, and then a script that runs on the syslog host which collects running/status/state statistics from things the the wrapper sends to syslog. \nI would hope that others are cognizant of how flexible cron can be and how that is more feature than curse for the most part.",1433963945

Leaking was downright easy, and getting caught was not certain.<p>I took recently a look at different products meant for file access auditing, to solve the part &quot;audit all information usage&quot; in cases where the information systems can not be adapted (COTS). There seems to be a surprisingly large amount of products with different feature sets and value propositions. Some of which have pretty steep prices and highly evolved features.<p>I got the inspiration to develop my own very simple tool, just for learning new skills and for the heck of it. A few hours of wading through MSDN, nerve wrecking C/C++ programming, tuning and it&#x27;s ready. Quality is a bit so-so (there might be at least memory leaks, although I attempted to catch them) and I had no accurate specifications, but here it is...<p>With this application all file accesses (creation of low level handles) cause an event that is logged at centralized log management system. I did not implement hashing the files or gathering them, because it probably has a direct impact on the performance of a desktop, but it would be trivial to add as a feature.<p>After the information is in the centralized log management system, it is relatively easy to generate for instance weekly report of all the file accesses of users. In AD environments one could fetch information about managers, push the data through a good PDF template, and email the reports. As outcome the managers would get weekly reports of what their underlings have accessed.<p>When the awareness of the previous would spread, that would raise the bar to even attempt anything in the higher security environments. The impact on the overall security in the long rould would be more significant than the actual technical feature. The information security tools work best when they have a psychological impact. Absurd but true. It&#x27;s not always the best to crank some technical bolt all the way.<p>On the other hand, some privacy should be guaranteed to the users by limiting the tool. At least in lower security environments this might come across, because employees probably nowadays have limited rights to use employer&#x27;s computers for their own matters, for instance accessing banking services while on lunch break.<p>I would appreciate comments, code review, bug and feature reports, etc!",1433963483

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s written in PHP, Ruby, or [language of the year] [0]. But if you let the programmers go wild, many of them have a tendency to pick the hottest thing just because [some reason that has no advantage from business POV].

This way you don&#x27;t need a temporary list<p><pre><code>    for (int i = names.size()-1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        String name = names.get(i);\n        if (name.startsWith(&quot;B&quot;)) names.remove(i);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAdmittedly, needing to use an explicit index counter is not as nice (and more prone to errors) as using the other for syntax. But one could imagine a language with e.g. macros that made the backwards-looping syntax more intuitive (I assume a single-threaded situation and an ArrayList).<p>Your general point still stands though.",1433963026

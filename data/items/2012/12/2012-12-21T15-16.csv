<i>The High Storage Eight Extra Large (hs1.8xlarge) instances are a great fit for applications that require high storage depth and high sequential I/O performance. Each instance includes 117 GiB of RAM, 16 virtual cores (providing 35 ECU of compute performance), and 48 TB of instance storage across 24 hard disk drives capable of delivering up to 2.4 GB per second of I/O performance.</i><p><i>This instance family is designed for data-intensive applications that require high storage density and high sequential I/O -- data warehousing, log processing, and seismic analysis (to name a few). We know that these applications can generate or consume tremendous amounts of data and that you want to be able to run them on EC2.
The storage on this instance family is local, and has a lifetime equal to that of the instance. You should think of these instances as building blocks that you can use to build a complete storage system. You should build a degree of redundancy into your storage architecture (e.g. RAID 1, 5, or 6) and you should use a fault-tolerant file system like HDFS or Gluster. Of course, you should also back up your data to Amazon S3 for increased durability.</i>

Just relying on ORM level validations is like saying ""hey I'm doing error checking in my javascript code and therefore checking for errors on the server side is redundant and unnecessary"". It's not, DB level ""redundant checking"" is worth it. All it takes is for one guy to ""just quickly try something"" in the db by trying to manipulate it directly without the ORM layer to have your db end up in an inconsistent state. ORMs have their own conventions on how they handle validations which maynot be completely obvious to a new developer on your team who is not familiar with it, whereas everyone understands how db level constraints operate. I'd rather put a few lines of extra code at the db level to make sure the data is safe than risk having the db end up in an inconsistent state, you are not only doing this for the customer but also for yourself. You don't want to be the developer who has to go in and figure out why certain queries are not returning the correct results after your db is in an inconsistent state.",1356104373

After that, banning semiautomatic rifles and handguns, but this would require constitutional changes.  Armed security at schools would be another approach (being endorsed by Senator Boxer).<p>For Aurora, mental health bars, possibly waiting periods, and possibly preempting local gun free zones would be the specific policy remedy with the least cost; banning semiautomatic pistols and handguns would be the intrusive but effective solution (via constitutional amendment).<p>For spree killings in general, the low hanging fruit is consensual agreement by the media to not dramatize the killers -- don't ever mention their names, similar to how suicide bombers are handled in Israel.  It's not the media/video games/etc. in general, it is specifically how the media treat these incidents.<p>If they want to deal with statistically prevalent gun violence, they should focus on handguns (80-90%) and the drug war.  Rifles and shotguns are essentially irrelevant to that.  Domestic violence is another issue, and there have been really strong changes in the past 10 years to address that (confiscating guns over even misdemeanor DV convictions, unless you're the Sheriff of San Francisco.)<p>Suicide is the other big issue around gun deaths, which I'm not sure you can really address through regulation, but better mental health access would probably be the best solution.<p>There should be a discussion of what the aims of legislation are (reducing gun crime overall, reducing specific types of crime), and then pick and promote measures which will actually accomplish those.<p>As far as I can tell, this was just a bunch of things a few mayors (Bloomberg, specifically) already wanted (interstate transport, 100% background check for all sales), and then the magazine ban randomly thrown in.<p>There is some really low hanging fruit which virtually everyone would support (100% checks on all transfers, mental health bars for getting guns, enhanced penalties for crimes at the federal level involving guns, and per-state changes to gun crime laws).",1356103522

He'll possibly want a title once he learns that you have one. That's fine. Make sure the founders are willing to make him VP as well, so you're equals.

So if that is the case, you might not be able to convince the management. Sure, your points are valid and I have the same frustration at work many times but understand that management doesn't care about proper unit testing etc. unless it impacts the business. As someone else pointed out, if you have critical production bugs frequently causing loss (specifically monetary), then you have a solid case to argue to change the process.<p>Not to say that you should just suck it up. I think it is worth to try and do things the best way but just keep in mind that you should not expect management to just do it because it is the right way to do it. So keep expectations low but keep trying as well.",1356102688

PhET is founded and chaired by Nobel prize winning physicist Carl Wieman.<p>These are high quality research based sims, unfortunately they are coded as Java applets and flash, this makes their use somewhat limited on the modern web.<p>I imagine there are hundreds of decent-to-great hackers on HN who should be able to at least code one of these Sims using HTML5 technology, hopefully I am not wrong:)<p>Consider this a holiday gift to all the kids who will be drawn into science by these sims. Instead of a kickstarter for money, this is a kickstarter for your time and knowledge.<p>If you are interested, please contact John.Blanco at colorado.edu, he's a dev on the project.
Put as subject: Interested in donating coding time.<p>So far here are some preliminary ports they've, this should give a hint of what they want, basically it should play nice with touch devices:<p>http://bit.ly/RHHxrf<p>http://bit.ly/ULa0J3<p>http://bit.ly/U1lFTd<p>http://bit.ly/Tbulb1<p>http://bit.ly/VV1bM0<p><i></i>FULL Disclosure<i></i><p>I am the founder/dev of APPYnotebook (www.appynotebook.com), an open source LMS with an emphasis on integrating these types of Apps/Sims directly into learning activities such as homework,labs and quizzes.<p>I do plan on porting the HTML5 version of these sims into APPYnotebook, but all ports will retain the same open source license as PhET and free to use.<p>An example of this type of integration would be to take this sim that is standalone http://bit.ly/RHHxrf, 
then integrate it into APPYnotebook to look like this: http://bit.ly/UUJXiX .<p>The advantage being that a student could now save state of the sim, do a writeup related to it, capture the results directly for assignment submission or print to PDF.",1356102089

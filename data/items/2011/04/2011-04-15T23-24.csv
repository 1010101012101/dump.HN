2452697,comment,2450030,2452304,5,0,trevelyan,,,"Perfect example. The Google IME was nowhere near the first of its kind; it just became popular with non-native speakers because Google didn't cram in advertising like its Chinese predecessors and made it free. The algorithms involved are technically simple and the basic data structures are multigrams indexed as a binary tree or HMMs.<p>The fact that developers had to steal data to do it instead of rolling their own corpus is a perfect example of the sort of chronic failure I'm talking about. Another is the fact they licensed Kingsoft materials (built off Linguistic Data Consortium data) instead of developing their own. Why outsource data development when you can hire people for under $2k per month to just do it for you?<p>The English language media typically focuses on Google's genuine political problems because it wants to use the company as an indicator for the state of US-China relations. So people slam Baidu (an innovative company!) as a copycat and no-one remarks on the way Google's behavior suggests no serious effort or willingness to tackle the non-trivial or data-intensive problems that crop up in the semantic analysis of Chinese text. It is possible Google was doing really innovative stuff that I haven't heard about, but the fact that Mountain View made the decision to pull out of the country without even informing its China office is yet another data point suggesting the China office wasn't doing anything terribly worthwhile. Google shut house the way you'd fire an unproductive staff member.<p>At a minimum, this lack of execution and/or attention to competing through innovation is embarrassing. Not for the main office which is focusing on language agnostic technologies. But it is bad for Google China and I would even go so far as to call it borderline incompetent. You can bet the parent company is heavily invested in semantic search in English, and Chinese is arguably a more important language for text analysis and retrieval in the 21st century.",1302911652

Implicit in the Lisp Curse is the distinction between the Lisp language and its users.  Furthermore, later in that essay, I wrote:<p><i>One result of these secondary and tertiary effects is that, even if Lisp is the most expressive language ever, such that it is theoretically impossible to make a more expressive language, Lispers will still have things to learn from other programming languages. The Smalltalk guys taught everyone -- including Lisp hackers -- a thing or two about object oriented programming. The Clean programming language and the Mozart/Oz combo may have a few surprises of their own.</i><p>Note the use of the words ""even if"" in that first sentence.  That means that I'm open to the idea of there being a more expressive programming language than Lisp.  Especially after taking a look at languages such as Clean and Mozart/Oz (which I learned about by reading Hacker News).  And if such a programming language doesn't exist, then (as I wrote in that paragraph) Lispers would still have to have a measure of humility.<p>Remember that the essay focuses on expressive power, but no one claims that that is the only thing that matters in a language.  I did not imply that much.  Paul Graham has noted that libraries are probably more important than the base language, nowadays.  I took pains to point out that Lisp hackers aren't innocent.

2452571,comment,2450972,2450972,1,0,presto8,,,"The title is a  bit misleading. The passphrase ""this is fun"" may be 10 time harder to brute-force than ""J4fS!2"", but both are hard enough that nobody would bother trying to brute force attack them. So they both are equally acceptable. I personally would rather type ""J4fS!2"", and here's why:<p>We use PGP Whole Disk Encryption at my company. The passphrase strength requirements are quite strict. It took me about two dozen attempts before I found a password that it would accept. The password was something along the lines of what the article is proposing, five short English words arranged in a sentence (about 25 characters long). This was acceptable to PGP because the software prefers longer passphrases with less entropy per character over short passphrases.<p>The problem is that it's quite hard to type this long passphrase in when all you can see on the screen is stars or dots. The longer a passphrase is, the higher chance there is of introducing a typo. A shorter passphrase, mixed case and with symbols, is, at least for a programmer, easier to type, especially with muscle memory.<p>In the case of PGP Whole Disk Encryption, they obviously realized this since you can press the tab key to enable showing the password in plaintext as you type it. I always do this because it increases the success rate of my password acceptance quite a bit.<p>On an unrelated note, it seems that a far bigger security risk on the Internet is the use of the same password on multiple web sites. If you use ""this is cool"" on ten different sites, then you are opening yourself up to serious vulnerability if one of the sites is compromised. Using a hash of a common password with the domain name provides a lot more security, but the simple implementations available today produce passwords that are short with mixed case and symbols versus long strings of words. But since the only sane way to use this approach is with a password manager, extension, or bookmarklet anyway, this doesn't seem to be a major limitation.<p>But having to create and remember short three to five word passphrases for dozens of web sites would be a daunting challenge!",1302909308

The RA spent more time debugging the (then very immature) Java than he did debugging Page's code so he rewrote it in Python.<p>Once they started getting traffic, the Python script that the RA had written couldn't stand up anymore, so they hired engineers to fix it again, who did so by rewriting it in C++.<p>Page's choice of Java originally was probably a faddish choice, given that Java was being hyped into the stratosphere by Sun at the time, even though neither the language nor its implementation were ready for prime time. The RA's choice of python was more reasonable, but Python was a highly esoteric research language at the point and did not have the ecosystem around it yet for writing scalable production code.",1302909110

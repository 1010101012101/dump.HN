6378515,comment,6377995,6378406,0,0,throwawayyyz,,,"My point was that some people don&#x27;t have a sense for proportions. I don&#x27;t vaccinate my own kids. However, in the grand scheme of things, I think that most parents who vaccinate do more harm and put more people at risk, including their own, than my wife and I.<p>My kids are breast-fed. That means they have a stronger immune system and spread less disease. Kids who are fed formula contract more diseases and are therefore putting infants at risk of developing complications of flu, for example.<p>We don&#x27;t drink. Alcohol-impaired drivers kill 30 people every day in the US. More than 10,000 people die every year because alcohol is legal.<p>I don&#x27;t smoke. Cigarettes kill 450,000 smokers. As an added bonus, thanks to tobacco being legal and easily accessible, 50,000 people die just because of secondhand smoke exposure.<p>My wife doesn&#x27;t smoke either. 2,000 babies die from SIDS in the US every year. Maternal smoking is the strongest risk factor leading to SIDS. Again, thank the tobacco companies.<p>My kids don&#x27;t eat junk. They know not to touch soft drinks. Parents fill up their shopping carts with nasty candy and Coca Cola and so 17% of children and adolescents in the US are now obese. Oh, but wait, they vaccinated. Very responsible parents. Thousands of children die every year from obesity-related complications, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. But hey, at least they didn&#x27;t have polio.<p>Measles is a concern because 50 kids had to be hospitalized last year for treatment? Big fucking deal. Really, big fucking deal. 150,000 and 300,000 annual cases of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children up to 18 months of age are attributable to secondhand smoke exposure. Between 7,500 and 15,000 result in hospitalization . Some of them die. Far more damage just from this societal fuckup of legalizing tobacco than any anti-vac parents will ever do.<p>I really respect and enjoy what folks on HackerNews have to say and this place is filled with very smart people. But when it comes to vaccines, personal health, pharmaceuticals and mega-corp-funded so-called science submissions here, I wonder what it is about tech folks that make them so brain washed.",1379044758

I&#x27;d still be a licensed driver and in the seat ready to take over with 3-5 seconds notice.<p>If I can have that by 2020 in a car like the Model S AWD, I&#x27;d be quite happy.<p>The next big jump in functionality for me would be pretty far -- a car which can operate genuinely autonomously, so I can get out and it doesn&#x27;t require me to find a parking spot.  I imagine doing that in an urban environment will be the last thing a self-driving car is technically or legally able to do.<p>Something which can self-drive for 30 minutes to drive from SF to PA doesn&#x27;t get me a huge amount.  It&#x27;d be nice to be able to use a tablet or something instead of driving, but it would be a lot cheaper/easier to just make a halfway decent audio-only (and maybe trivial HUD and chording keyboard) computer for the car, rather than self-driving tech.  <i>that</i> we could have done 15 years ago; self driving probably wasn&#x27;t feasible until 5-10 years ago.",1379044734

Perhaps you can use Analysis & Design tasks not to estimate the actual work, but further research tasks necessary to get to a more solid answer. Setting the expectation that all issues can be analyze and designed in 6 hours seems arbitrary.<p>Many times the Analysis and Design of a solution encompasses trying things out and actually experimenting with changes. By the time you&#x27;re done with Analysis and Design you&#x27;ve virtually implemented the solution. Of course there is the documentation and reviews that you could also estimate separately.<p>This is a classic human problem - we suck at estimation. And if some pointy haired boss is demanding perfect estimates, you should give him or her good estimates for the next piece of work you can predict rather than the finished task.",1379041520

And Putin never made the direct claim that he was doing it better than America, merely expressing how the states need to get off the high horse. Of course Russia has issues.

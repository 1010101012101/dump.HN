Maybe 2-3 weeks/month, before a video goes behind paywall.<p>The monthly fees are kinda a downer though, until you think about it. Those people who want to watch all interviews, are better off paying a monthly fee, instead of being nickle and dimed to death with per video fees.<p>The whole idea here isn't to charge people, but to get more participation out of your audience. This way more people will watch people live/right away. And will be much more likely to discuss it in real time...creating more buzz about the interviews. Which should lead to even better guests.<p>+ think about it...the reason you are complaining that he is starting to charge...is because you realize just how valuable the content is.

1141229,comment,1140486,1140845,0,0,_delirium,,,"It's not clear to me that medicine actually has ""more capability"" than a decade ago in the same way that computers are today objectively faster. Studies attempting to show improvement in outcomes due to improvements in medicine tend to be inconclusive or negative for most areas, though there've been improvements in a few narrow ones (like HIV prognosis). For most diseases, though, your probabilities basically haven't budged in the past 20 years.<p>In any case, I see the analogy as pushing the opposite viewpoint: in computers I get more capability for <i>less</i> money than a decade ago. I used to have to spend $2000 for a decent laptop, but now I spend $700. Why can't I get better medicine than a decade ago for >50% discount? Does the medical field not make technological advances in the same way as computing, that make existing technology get cheaper over time?",1266785859

The sudden-death nature of a microtimebox like 25/5 and 48/12 is what forces you to eliminate the unnecessary. A person can stay in the flow and do lots of unimportant things beautifully. A timebox often means you make choices and then you keep going, staying in the present. Second-guessing is another form of distraction, as much as falling under Sunk Cost Fallacy.<p>Another important note: it isn't so much that you avoid distractions as much as you stay in the present moment.

Your attention is no longer on the task at hand and your mental energy pours into that self-awarenes. If you let the observation pass you by as a ephemeral phenomena, living and dying naturally, you flow with the self-awareness of flow.<p>Allowing the distractions to flow past you while you stay focused on the task at hand is what gives the optimal results. Trying to completely numb yourself to distractions won't work a well. That's why there's something in the Pomodoro technique where you make a hash tick and write down what you want to do later; it flushes that thought out of the queue. It also keeps your peripheral awareness opened up so that your right-brain-side can explore alternate avenues and come up with innovative, and occasionally creative solutions. If you stay focused strictly by blocking everything else out, you gain tunnel vision. In that state, a person crushes obstacles by banging his head against it enough times.

It could also be that the administration has a more belligerent and inept political team than Clinton's administration did. Or a combination. Or something else. Remember that as the party in power, the administration's role (under the divide-and-conquer strategy) is to be accommodating and generous. Intimidating the minority party -- even if they deserve the bashing -- is just going to solidify their position and make the problem worse.<p>Hey. Just my opinion.

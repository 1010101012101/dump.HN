You sit with your legs underneath you instead of in front of you, which puts your back at a much more natural angle (much like standing, actually) than a standard office chair.  They're cheap (mine was $75) and very compact, so you can augment them with a ""normaller"" chair.  Long hours in a kneeling chair can strain certain muscles (the small of my back gets a little tight), so I do recommend using a standard chair about %20 of the time.<p>I alternate between a cheap office chair and a cheap kneeling chair (something like this - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Boss-Office-Products-Ergonomic-Kneeling/product-reviews/B00429Q38I/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Boss-Office-Products-Ergonomic-Kneelin...</a>), switching if I feel any twinge of discomfort, and my back and neck feel great.",1315987123

As soon as a feature has got released to all users of a software, you won't be able to disable it without some users becoming really dissatisfied.<p>The solution is not to release a new feature to all users.<p>Before even thinking about releasing a new feature, first ask yourself:<p>What is the goal of this new feature?<p>The answer to that question is your hypothesis, you need to try to answer by experimenting.  \nThat is, perform an A/B-test:<p>Launch the feature to a subset of your users and check if it achieves its goal.\nThis goal must of course be measurable and ideally there are KPIs that you can use to check the success or failure of your experiment.<p>When the experiment is successful you deploy the feature for all users.\nIf the experiment fails, you remove it for the subset of users and the rest will never know about it.<p>This also helps the codebase to stay clean, features not making it into the product, is code not making it into your codebase, which means less code to maintain, less complexity.",1315987115

It requires a few compromises.<p>If you're feeding input into a non-deterministic game the character won't be exactly where they were last time, etc. You could keep track of the movement offset and see if it's within an acceptable range, or you could check the character's speed at two times and make sure they're accelerating properly, etc. Design a test level to highlight the potential problems (weird ground polys, whatever) and write an in-game script to test the behavior.<p>I think I could even script visual checks - mostly. You'd make, for example, a level prone to Z-buffering errors, where the colors were chosen to make it obvious - like a red wall showing through a white one. Save a stream of screenshots and compare them. Trivially, check for red. More complex, and perhaps better, check for high-contrast areas. It wouldn't tell you if the picture looked good overall but it'd be fairly good at finding instances of that one bug.<p>And for unit tests, don't be so quick to write such a good test that throwing it away is painful when you want to refactor the code.",1315986975

This tool lets you store things that you are going to do in the <i>near</i> future. And the rest... lets deal with it when we get there.\nI think if you can't remember it a month from now, it probably not important.<p>In any real project you can never deal with all the bugs and reports. so you usually deal with the most serious ones and the ones that get reported most often. the important ones go on todo right away, and the often reported ones do not need another place for them. people will keep reporting until you deal ;)<p>so this tool is effectively lets you plan your activities in the short and medium term. once you get to the 'next year' you will have other priorities and new things to do. there is no need to plan it now.<p>Im definitely going to try it.

Sure, it's a bit cumbersome to write, but nobody says you <i>have</i> to use it for everything. It plays well enough with shell scripts that you can leave the heavy lifting to another language and use AppleScript as a bridge between the command line and the UI. Me and a friend once wrote a bot in Python to control various music players from IRC. The bot uses AppleScript to talk to iTunes on OS X, and GObject introspection (or whatever they use on GNOME these days; I have little experience with desktop Linux) to talk to Rhythmbox.

Nobody is stopped from working if they&#x27;re movitated to do so, but we generally discourage each other from working overtime unnecessarily. I personally work 32-hour weeks regularly and still contribute meaningfully.<p>And then, I go backpacking or bike-riding or something that tends to be demanding physically and relaxing mentally—I find it helps me keep a healthy balance.

E.g., if a resource request is in progress, then a second request to the same resource simply uses the output of the first (which is a problem if it&#x27;s stateful output for the user).<p>After reading most of the JavaFX and WebKit codebases I realized that isolation is not possible without recompiling a modified WebKit. So then I set about figuring out how to isolate Java code. But most solutions are half-baked, are only academic research projects, or require a special JVM.<p>However, if you load JavaFX along with native libs into a classloader for each browser instance, then they&#x27;re effectively isolated. The downside is that objects of the same class have completely different un-castable types if they&#x27;re from different classloaders.<p>So then I needed to use reflection to lookup classnames at runtime and resolve them dynamically.<p>Anyhow, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ovxVHW9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ovxVHW9.png</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/MachinePublishers/jBrowserDriver"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MachinePublishers/jBrowserDriver</a>",1423366975

Sure. But the provided example isn&#x27;t one of those cases.<p>It favors replacement. Consider it taken to a logical extreme - every item is throwaway. That&#x27;s not what most people would consider repairable, and yet, under your definition of repairability, it&#x27;s the most repairable system there is (as anything can be &quot;repaired&quot; with one swap). So I disagree with your definition.<p>I disagree with your assertion that &quot;in terms of the life-cycle of any mechanical system, repairability and reliability asymptotically become synonyms&quot;. My parent&#x27;s current car is a whole lot more reliable than the clunker they used to had - but on the flip side it&#x27;s a whole lot less repairable. In other words, it takes longer to break, but when it does it&#x27;s a whole lot harder (and more expensive) to return to a working state.<p>And I agree regarding printer cartridges - the current system is insane.

Should they immerse them in English-only courses (good for English-learning, bad for 'everything else'-learning and putting them at a disadvantage) or should they start in Spanish and slowly transition them to English-only courses?  It was an interesting discussion, but was (understandably) framed around the idea that the children were part of a growing problem which badly needed a solution.<p>Simultaneously, I (a native English speaker) was sitting in a required high school Spanish course (two years), which was progressing at turtle-like speeds and effectively useless unless you were in AP Spanish.<p>For the life of me I can't understand how these two 'problems' can exist in a school system and administrators can't put two and two together.

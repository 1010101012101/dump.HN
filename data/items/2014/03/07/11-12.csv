Generally speaking, makes sense: we breath O2 and release CO2. When preparing to sleep the O2 quantity will be diminished considerably in the room. So it&#x27;s better to allow as much, as possibly bigger % of O2 in the room.<p>But other than that, I know just know that patients with COPD and sleep deprivation disorders use oxygen therapy to get better. How exactly it works, I don&#x27;t know though nor I can be 100% that enhances cognitive awareness.<p>ps. Air quality is usually associated with room temperature.

7359706,comment,7359454,7359638,30,0,bananas,,,"One of the core aspects of XML that is really important is that no typing is inferred by the structure of the file unlike JSON. JSON is by nature tied to the JavaScript type system which is sparse and inaccurate. For example, if you look at the following:<p><pre><code>   { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;: 1e999 }\n</code></pre>\nAh crap! Deserializer blew (in most cases silently converting the number to null)<p><pre><code>   <person>\n      <name>bob</name>\n      <salary>1e999</salary>\n   </person>\n\n</code></pre>\nNo problem. The consumer can throw that at their big decimal deserialiser.<p>And the following is <i>not</i> acceptable as it breaks the semantics of JSON and requires a secondary deserialisation step as strings ain&#x27;t numbers...<p><pre><code>   { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;: &quot;1e999&quot; }\n</code></pre>\nJSON is a popular format but it&#x27;s awful.",1394192821

Part of this is a problem with popular libraries rather than inherent to the format, but we judge a thing by its ecosystem rather than in isolation. So: namespaces are a pain, making it much harder than it should be to just make my xpath work. DTDs are annoying, especially when a production system breaks because a remote server that was hosting a DTD goes down so now your parser refuses to load a file. User-defined entities seem pointless, and though most parsers can handle the billion laughs these days it wasn&#x27;t always so. The handling of text nodes is confusing; whitespace is irrelevant except when it isn&#x27;t. Specifying the encoding inside the document itself seems wrong, and supporting multiple encodings at all causes trouble (e.g. sometimes it&#x27;s simply impossible to include one document in another inline).<p>Is XML schema really so much better than e.g. JSON schema?<p>To me it feels like there&#x27;s an impedance mismatch between the kind of structures XML lends itself to and the kind of structures programs are good at dealing with.

Like a digital media player, for example, which tries to keep the HD spinning. It&#x27;s a noise that you won&#x27;t listen or pay attention to during the day, but at 2 A.M. your brain listens and process the noise.<p>The brain is an incredible <i>machine</i>. It tries to isolate all the <i>known</i> noises. So you have a phenomenon where people fall asleep while the <i>usual noises</i> can be captured by the ear, but when a <i>new noise</i> - as in unidentified - jumps in, you suddenly wake up.<p>If you can keep all these noises to a minimum, by switching off (not off mode, really off) such devices, will enhance your sleep quality. Keeps the brain less busy.<p>Also note that digital devices (especially routers and digital players) raise the room temperature by at least a couple of Celsius degrees, sometimes more[1]. Ideally, no working device should be on the bedroom while you&#x27;re sleeping.<p>[1] I had a Dreambox-500 PVR in my bedroom.

7359573,comment,7352372,7358262,1,0,joostdevries,,,"I was wondering about the persistent negativity about Scala since it runs counter to my own very positive experiences with Scala and Play. For me it hits just the sweet spot between monadic goodness and getting stuff done in the JVM eco system.<p>For Scala 2.11 I&#x27;m excited about the focus on performance of map and flatmap in List. Those are my bread and butter at the moment. It&#x27;s amazing how intuïtive that becomes once you use it everyday for dealing with futures, collections etc and you forget about the mathematical monad etc underpinnings for a moment.<p>I hope that splitting xml parsing off into a module will reinvigorate xml support that&#x27;s highly performant and easy to use. Of course json is all the hotness. But there&#x27;s a lot of xml services out there to be used. So that&#x27;s a core tool for a lot of applications.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to try out the compiler/sbt speed improvements in sbt 13.2. \nI seem to recall that there are talks on unifying the compilation of sbt and the IDE. That&#x27;s something I look forward to since I tend to use the ~ continuous run/test/compile options of sbt and then having another compilation going on at the same time within my IDE seems wasteful.<p>I do hope that the Eclipse Scala IDE gets enough love and will continue to improve. A lot of companies in the Java space got used to free IDEs. (I know that&#x27;s penny wise) So having a good free IDE is a strong enabler for grass roots Scala adoption.<p>Together with the super support for JS MVC applications that&#x27;s coming up in Play 2.3 I&#x27;m looking forward to putting this to use.",1394190135

It is the product of itself only, so it can be represented as a set of factors like {5}.  1 is the product of nothing, and would be represented as the set of factors {}.<p>Multiplication, obviously, just combines the factors of the multiplicands. 6 (= {2,3}) times 2 (= {2}) equals {2,2,3}, 12.

Anything west, it evaluates to true as long as it is set and there is a timezone offset.  This is because once you are at a negative offset, you subtract and get a higher number so it will never evaluate to false with a negative offset.<p>Basically this current behavior is useless for anything I can imagine.  You can&#x27;t use it to check for midnight UTC.  You can&#x27;t use it to check for whether it is set.  You can probably use to check for midnight with no timezone but add a timezone and now your handling is messy.<p>This is why contracts need to be sanely written from a code contract point ahead of time.

An object passing by or colliding with the ""proto-moon"" could easily deflect it from its crash course.  Whether that's probable given the evidence is a different question, but mathematically it absolutely is possible.<p>And that's even assuming that the ""mass"" is more or less solid - if it were ejected from a violent impact it's more likely that it would be more of a cloud of debris, in which case things get even more complex.  So many ""bodies"" are involved that it becomes more of a fluid dynamics problem than an orbital mechanics one.  The individual particles in the cloud interact with each other gravitationally, deflecting each other from their ""return-to-sender"" orbit.  Parts of the cloud would fall to earth, parts would escape to space, and parts would stay in orbit to become a ring system or (as is hypothesized) one or more moons.<p>The theorized situation isn't so much like skipping a stone across the earth as totally vaporizing a big chunk of both the earth and the planet that hit it, and a fairly small part of the resulting cloud (about half according to some models) of debris managing to end up in orbit and eventually collapsing into a single body (the moon).",1333370920

E.g. when I'm searching for ""Ruby"", it gives me the homepage of the programming language as the first result and most other results are about this language too. When my wife searches the same thing, it gives her the Wikipedia page on rubbies, some stuff about Ruby's Diner, 1 or 2 YouTube videos, etc...<p>Of course I've noticed that this user-profiling is pretty dumb currently, but it's getting better. And skipping over privacy issues and the death of the long-tail, this is in fact what most people want and I also think that normal users do not care about the loss of privacy, unless they've been bitten by the side effects.<p>Then Google's own crawler can hardly be matched. Consider how web interfaces these days are more and more reliable on JavaScript. It's easy to run a headless browser and render a JavaScript-enhanced page from a script, but it's hard to scale that to hundreds of millions of web pages and workaround all the idiotic things that people do with JavaScript. Also couple that with the need to serve fresh news to people that want it, so the crawler has to be smart enough / fast enough for near real-time consumption.<p>Then Google's other services are complementing their search, stuff like Google Places or Google Maps. Personally I hate when such results are cluttering my view, but when searching for places (e.g. restaurants, kindergartens), people are happy to get such results straight on the first page. And btw, I don't know how they do search by voice recognition on Android, but it's a no-brainer to improve the voice recognition based on global trends or even on the user's profile - the point being that there's a lot they can do with the data and infrastructure they have that's out of reach for small startups.<p>Personally I liked the old Google better, but it's going to take a lot more than improved privacy to eat their launch.",1333370248

Back then I was working for some company as a graphics designer -- I had been there for about 1 year (fresh out of school) -- building the layouts for their countless websites. Back then the whole internet industry was about to collapse and I could see the proverbial axe dangling over me come the end of my year contract.<p>A coworker of mine was responsible for the programming. Mostly perl and php. I had never touched a line of code. Not even HTML. I was doing everything a-la WYSIWYG. The mere thought of having to write code made me cringe but it was obvious that I had to adapt if I wanted to keep receiving pay checks. So I set out to teach myself everything I could about programming in the boss' time.<p>I scoured the internet and read every bit I could find. I started out with BlitzBasic[1] and C# (It was in beta back then). To my complete astonishment, I actually /really/ loved every bit of it. Since then I quit my job and went home to become a halfway decent programmer. I was adamant that this would be my new career path. And I succeeded!<p>Around 2008/2009, C# was into its 3rd iteration if memory serves. I had left Blitzbasic behind a long time ago. I was still enjoying every minute I could spend typing code. However, C# had some traits that really started to rub me the wrong way. The 'everything is an object' OOP mentality, coupled with the pretentious and obtuse habit of corporations to not give a shit about skills unless you can recite all design patterns by heart, really made me lose faith in the whole programming thing.<p>Fortunately, that's when Go[2] came into view and it allowed me to fall in love with programming all over again. I've never looked back to C# since that day. In the meantime, I've also picked up C, Scheme, Forth, Factor and a host of other languages I love working with.<p>I am very much a D.S.L. kind of guy but Go is definitely my primary go-to guy for most stuff.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.blitzbasic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blitzbasic.com</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://golang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org</a>",1333369741

Mine is just 1 of many viewpoints.</i><p>It's complicated:<p>1) Grouping all designers together and assuming we're all good at design, graphics, ui, ux, and info architecture is like grouping all programmers together and assuming they're all good at php, C++, java, ruby, mysql, oracle, javascript, visual basic, python, and perl. See what I mean. When you want a designer, you need to understand WHICH type of designer do you want. The same way you need to know what kind of programmer you need. In many elements of design such as Typography, layout, logos, branding, color, information architecture, visual graphics, user experience, and interface design. Finding a designer that does ALL of these well is extremely difficult. And it may not be a good idea to hire them either. Would you want to hire someone that has a little experience in every commonly used programming language or someone who specializes very well in just 2?<p>(All designers have a few necessary overlapping skills and often can work together very well and smoothly if they stay out of each other's way)<p>- UX Designer - In charge of what the user ""FEELS"" and what the user will get out of the site. Sets up user experience guidelines, helps create, pull, or finalize all features, user stories, usability studies, navigation maps, wire-frames, prototypes, persona storyboards. If the UX designers does their job wrong the user can ""feel"" confused about the site or doubt its legitimacy or ability to solve the user's problem and within 5 seconds leave, never to return. So emotion and feeling is extremely important. The UX designer crafts the foundation of the site based on predicting what the target audience wants and how they expect the site to help them achieve it.<p>- UI Designer - In charge of ""HOW"" the user interacts with the site. Sets up user interface guidelines, eye flows, layouts, button and input controls, control over all visual elements and what they do and how they interact with the user and a lot of overlapping responsibilities with the UX designer.<p>- Graphics Designer - In charge of what the user ""SEES"". Branding, logos, company colors, typography and custom fonts, sets up color & visual guidelines (buttons, logos, etc...), frequently works with photos and vector illustrations, often photographers.<p>See how different designers can be? In general you want to start with the UX guy, then the UI and Graphics Designer. You can have all 3 in the room but I personally believe the UX designer should ALWAYS be the first in.<p>2) Chasing the mythical designer + coder + know-it-all. Some of us can do design very well and a bit of front end coding. Design (visual) and programming (logical + mathematical) are so different. All the good programmers I've seen are terrible with visual design and all the great graphics designers I know are bad programmers. This is for a reason. It's very rare that someone has acquired both talents.<p>3) Don't make your designer do ALL of your front end coding. Because that just wastes everyone's time and assumes your designer is an efficient javascrip / jquery / css + xhtml coder. I personally love to start with css+xhtml THEN photoshop if needed. But as soon as I hit heavy javascript coding I start sinking. I would love to be able to get my design done and pass it on to someone who can code up the javascript quicker and better than I can. In a startup environment where speed and iteration are crucial this is really important. Everyone specializes in something and does that something very well and very quickly. Rather than having only a few people try to do everything they're not good at and end up doing a mediocre job that took three times as long as it should have.<p>4) Your broad requirements make us feel insecure. I'm a user interface + user experience + information architecture type of designer. Color, graphics, logos, custom fonts are NOT my strength and I cannot in any way compete with graphics artists who specialize in areas. I can do front end coding but only to an extent. I can make really easy to use sites but I can't give them that color + icons + logo + custom fonts + graphics themeing that a graphics artist can. Likewise the web is showered with websites made by graphics artists who aren't good at ux + ui + info architecture. These websites look pretty, have great icons, colors, & buttons but the layouts and site architecture are horrendous which leads to the user experience being horrendous as well. So when you ask for a designer that can ""make everything pretty"" I immediately skip the job offer because I don't want to disappoint you. When a visual designer sees the job opening they'll send you their portfolio of pretty websites that have improper eye flow, and terrible ux and you'll decline hiring them. Had you taken out that ""graphics designer"" must-have-requirement I would have gladly spent hours chatting with you in person (never online) on the direction you can take.<p>5) Hire me (UX + UI + Info Architecture) BEFORE you've hired a general graphics designer (icons + colors + logo + custom fonts). Otherwise It's useless. It's like hiring a painter before you've got your drywall put up.<p>Long Story Short, many startups don't know what kind of designer they need. If they hire a UX+UI designer they need to do that at the very beginning, then after they've got their beta product/service tried and tested they should go for a really nice graphics designer to help them with branding and look and feel. If you do it the other way around you just end up wasting time, and cause a lot of frustration for both designers because they have to RE-do all their work when ironing out design conflicts.<p>A UX designer is someone that you need to hire at the very beginning. You would sit down with them for Hours and hours over the course of MANY days (so pick someone you can stand) with huge sheets of paper and will start drafting out what it is the site MUST do and what it must NOT do. Finalize requirements and features, list content required, intents, user stories, and a million other things. There will be a lot of compromises having to be made, and there will be a lot of back and forth decision making. You will talk with your UX designer more than any of the others.<p>A UI designer is focused on the users, not you. They'll be off doing usability and predictability studies and designing the interface that the users will be using to solve the problems that the UX designer outlined.<p>A Graphics Designer can telecommute more, and can be left alone, send you mockups and seek feedback and a/b testing from users. They'll take everything from the UX and UI designer and add emotional appeal using color, lines, graphics, imagery, and photography, typography, logos, & icons.<p>All 3 are very important. If just ->1<- of these designers does their job wrong your website will be off (which may or may not hurt you). Look at craigslist, it's visual design is horrendous but it's ease of use thanks to a decent UI made up for it. Unforunately there's lots of spam and other problems that is killing' it's user experience.",1333369709

Though requests makes short work of common things, I think it actually abstracts some HTTP details more so than WebOb in a way that leaves the user less informed about what's going on in the HTTP, Basic Auth for example. Which makes it it's own protocol, just like WSGI. WSGI in my experience makes light work of implementing HTTP IMO, it's fairly easy to read the part of the HTTP spec you need to handle and then make that work in WSGI, I'm not so sure requests could make that any easier without intervention from the library authors.<p>I think there's still a place for requests, but I don't see it as becoming the standard way to build HTTP Requests and handle HTTP Responses.

In the other, the HR representative herself doesn't have a degree.<p>I've had two employers who were interested in me, turn me down because of the degree. They said they could not hire me because the job description said a degree was required, and they cannot NOT discriminate against me on that -- apparently degree requirements are a way to legally get rid of undesireable applicants without it looking like racial or age discrimination. If they dropped the degree requirement they would get more applicants and it would be harder for them to decide who's best, as well as open them up to (in their view) more discrimination lawsuits. So they use the degree as a legal form of discrimination provided no exceptions are made to it.<p>Of course the effect of degree requirements, including degree requirements for foreign immigrants, has been degree inflation -- a Ph.D. today is worth what a MS was 30 years ago.<p>I have thought about getting a degree by examination, e.g., CLEP, or trying to get an honorary degree (I have professor friends), but I refuse to go back to undergraduate classrooms with lecture, homework and exam style learning.

NVIDIA has done some direct hardware address implementations where you can bypass most of the OpenGL overhead, and other ways to bypass some of the hidden state of OpenGL. Those things are good and useful, but what I most want to see is direct surfacing of the memory. It’s all memory there at some point, and the worst thing that kills Rage on the PC is texture updates. Where on the consoles we just say “we are going to update this one pixel here,” we just store it there as a pointer. On the PC it has to go through the massive texture update routine, and it takes tens of thousands of times [longer] if you just want to update one little piece. You start to advertise that overhead when you start to update larger blocks of textures, and AMD actually went and implemented a multi-texture update specifically for id Tech 5 so you can bash up and eliminate some of the overhead by saying “I need to update these 50 small things here,” but still it’s very inefficient. So I’m hoping that as we look forward, especially with Intel integrated graphics [where] it is the main memory, there is no reason we shouldn't be looking at that. With AMD and NVIDIA there's still issues of different memory banking arrangements and complicated things that they hide in their drivers, but we are moving towards integrated memory on a lot of things. I hope we wind up being able to say ""give me a pointer, give me a pitch, give me a swizzle format,"" and let me do things managing it with fences myself and we'll be able to do a better job.<p><a href=""http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Editorial/John-Carmack-Interview-GPU-Race-Intel-Graphics-Ray-Tracing-Voxels-and-more/Intervi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Editorial/John-Carmack-Intervie...</a>",1333369099

The whole mentality in the OS X developer world glows of such a strong focus on usability and UI design, while, for some reason I cannot understand, the Windows and Linux world is mostly the diametrical opposite. This was the first thing that I noticed when I moved over to OS X; the difference was incredibly clear, and it struck with great impact.

I get the feeling Duck Duck Go has the same level of developer good will behind it.<p>As I see it, Google's business model is so wrapped up in profiling and tracking that it will be difficult for them respond to Duck Duck Go if it gains any traction.

However, as you pointed out, Jane Street appears to be highly successful with OCaml (although they don't report their earnings), and several well-known FOSS projects like darcs and xmonad are written in Haskell.<p>Edit: Also, Ruby and Python are probably as well suited to functional programming as Scala is, outside of Scala's parallelization models that we tend to associate with functional programming.

9354,comment,9171,9254,0,0,timg,,,"Not all ideas, no matter how world-changing, can be turned into a full company with just one founder and roughly zero cash. For young founders, 15k, partners and a basic support system can make a world of a difference.<p>edit: The real deciding factor for me though will be his equity equation.",1175802399
9353,comment,8863,9324,0,0,dhouston,,,"couple of clarifications :)<p>1) i have other people working with me on this. i did prototype it alone, but i don't intend to be a single founder. i won't belabor it here, but it's really a good idea to get other people on board and the reasons yc and everyone have for not encouraging single founders are valid. your odds are much worse, and playing superman gets old after a while when you're trying to do everything -- and it's more fun to have more people involved and excited about the idea anyway.<p>2) re: applying: i am applying for this round, but actually didn't apply for funding for the last wfp. however, i did apply 2 years ago (with a cofounder) with another idea and wasn't selected.",1175802175

9349,comment,9348,9348,0,0,zaidf,,,"I know sitting in the apartment coding all day, eating cookies while watching the Daily Show sounds like a dream moment. But it was one of the first lessons I learned when I entered college: it doesn't work for me.<p>I like to take each morning as a new work day--shower, hit the library, make calls, hit a class or two, continue work on start-up. <p>I'm assuming YComb doesn't provide office space. So I'm curious if there have been YC companies that came together to get some space to create a collective work environment away from their apartment?",1175801332

9346,comment,3788,3788,0,0,rebecca_d,,,"Video online advertising is a small segment of total online advertising but has one of the rosiest futures. $378 million for 2006 which will rise to $1.3 billion in 2011. I will bet the ranch I don't have (not much of a bet, is it?) that this $1.3 billion will look like a laughably small estimate by 2011. Another market to watch is the local online ad market, which grew a remarkable 32% in 2006 to total 7.7 billion. It is supposed to double by 2021. \n'In five years, local online video advertising will surpass $5 billion, representing more than one-third of all local online advertising. Where will most of that money go? Not to the purveyors of traditional ""word from our sponsor"" commercials, but to those who can offer long-form video information that their Web site visitors actually choose to see.""\nBorrell Associates, Local Online Video forecast ",1175800373

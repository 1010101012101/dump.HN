Know a few who dropped hundreds on this title.<p>Putting out &quot;gold plated mechs&quot; for five hundred bucks basically sealed the deal for a large portion of the player base. Also, they took up the trick of having sales for items to be delivered three to six months out. That lets them avoid the charge back period on credit cards, so if they are really late or never deliver there is no recourse.<p>Combine that with forever missing deadlines on key features; namely giving the game a long term point other than endless death matches; and its not a great place to be.<p>The even co-opted an early friendly site to where the postings by that sites presenters are routinely shouted down on reddit.<p>It gave fans of the genre very nice looking mechs but deliver a multi player version of MechWarrior 2 many wanted.",1403780129

London routinely ranks number one in the world in customer and tourist satisfaction for taxis.  As someone who lives here, i think Uber has its place, but the taxi system is akin to a public good that needs regulation.  The barriers to entry and designed to prevent abuse to the privileges that come with being licensed taxi. As a rider, the most important privileges to me are the ability to use bus lanes, and that i can hail a cab anywhere, anytime, knowing that the vehicle and driver will be safe.  Without regulation, its impossible to obtain that standard.<p>It would be much more helpful to start with an informed and complete view of the situation (which varies in every city), than build a straw man from which the author argues for a complete reform in governance and regulation in all marketplaces(really? thats the point here?)",1403779654

Spend the effort to educate users about privacy and tracking and build easy to use software options, rather than investing time in standards that don&#x27;t get adopted and are based on trust.<p>The voluntary standards were never going to work since the interests of the parties involved are diametrically opposed. The voluntary systems only work for the ad companies if a very small number of users take up the option and if privacy remains a niche issue. As soon as developers looked to apply DNT broadly, they baulked.<p>Trust is also an issue. Facebook previously said that although their share buttons are hosted on the same domain as facebook.com, meaning cookies are sent - that they are not storing or tracking user web browsing data. They now <i>are</i> using that data, and very little was made of the reversal.<p>The same reversal or business changes could turn on DNT in the same way. With DNT the sites still receive the cookies and can still store the data. They are able to comply with DNT for a period and then later reverse their position and still use the old data for targeting (and a DNT header is one more data bit that says a lot about a user).<p>There are now a number of competing opt out standards. None of them really work and they each have problems, but companies need to be able to say they let users opt out whenever they announce a new tech that encroaches further into our lives (Facebook use aboutads, the NAI has their own, Google has its own, most of the aggregators have their own, there are other efforts to sync opt-out).<p>The solution is to cut the problem off at the head and solve it with software. Browsers and that are easy to use in terms of specifying who you trust (like installing an app) and that don&#x27;t ever make third-party requests by default. Now that the pretense of negotiating a solution has been dropped, effort can go into developing better software control for users and tech solutions - since none of the current offerings are perfect (which is excusable).",1403779269

7948896,comment,7948688,7948688,3,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t think the author has read the Ariane crash report, which says:<p>> Although the source of the Operand Error has been identified, this in itself did not cause the mission to fail. The specification of the exception-handling mechanism also contributed to the failure. In the event of any kind of exception, the system specification stated that: the failure should be indicated on the databus, the failure context should be stored in an EEPROM memory (which was recovered and read out for Ariane 501), and finally, the SRI processor should be shut down.<p>> It was the decision to cease the processor operation which finally proved fatal. Restart is not feasible since attitude is too difficult to re-calculate after a processor shutdown; therefore the Inertial Reference System becomes useless. The reason behind this drastic action lies in the culture within the Ariane programme of only addressing random hardware failures. From this point of view exception - or error - handling mechanisms are designed for a random hardware failure which can quite rationally be handled by a backup system.<p>> ... An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the SRI was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. The Board has reason to believe that this view is also accepted in other areas of Ariane 5 software design. The Board is in favour of the opposite view, that software should be assumed to be faulty until applying the currently accepted best practice methods can demonstrate that it is correct.<p>There were also questions about why the code was even still in operation. The functionality was useful under Ariane 4 but not Ariane 5, the code &quot;serves no purpose&quot; after launch, analysis was done to check some variables for overflow but not all variables, and the component&#x27;s functional requirements weren&#x27;t updated to reflect the new launch trajectory data.<p>To say it&#x27;s only because of an exception during type conversion ignores the whole, very important context, which says that the exception wasn&#x27;t the real problem.",1403778836

The fact that they are signed for two years instead of one is handy too.<p>I&#x27;ve recently signed up for that to get some wildcard+multiname certs mainly for convenience (not having to sign a new cert for every tld/sub-domain combination), and not have s wildcard cert for my vanity domain and one for all the names associated with a project that I&#x27;m trying to work on (<i>.domain.net, </i>.domain.com, <i>.domain.co.uk, </i>.domain.uk all in one certificate). Remember before considering this though: there is some extra security in having separate certificates for everything instead of a huge wildcard-for-all arrangement. If you PK for a combined wildcard certificate leaks from any one location any security problems that causes affects every location you have that one certificate in use, so I am trading off a convenience gain against taking a little extra risk.",1403776987

I find it gives you much better control over what gets blocked, and it properly blocks what you have told it to, not just hide them.<p>I have it set up in quite a restrictive way so by default a site level scope is created and only image/css is allowed. It means I have to take anywhere from a couple of seconds to a few minutes to enable things a site needs to function, but I much prefer that to having tracking cookies, social media buttons, obnoxious adverts etc.<p>Also the Adblock site claims you can also block a few annoyances specific to Facebook[0]. Is that actually the case? I thought Adblock just used element hiding.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://facebook.adblockplus.me/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.adblockplus.me/en/</a>",1403776829

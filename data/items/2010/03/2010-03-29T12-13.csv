Let's suppose there's a HakyllAction monad. The >>= signature would be:<p><pre><code>  HakyllAction a -> (a -> HakyllAction b) -> HakyllAction b
</code></pre>
If we implement this operator, we get a value `HakyllAction a` and a function `a -> HakyllAction b`. We can look at the dependencies of the value, but we don't have access to the dependencies of the `a -> HakyllAction b`. If we want that, we need to apply it to the first value.<p>This goes against the idea of dependency handling -- we want to know the dependencies first, and then only execute the function if needed.<p>Hope this helps.",1269864808

In addition, everything they publish is supposed to be against the wishes of some national government somewhere.<p>Nope. Once they gave up neutrality, they're not a publishing channel.

That said, there are a small number of elite traders out there that make these types of returns and are fully content not growing their account infinitely.<p>Also, as your account gets larger, trading it for the same types of returns becomes more and more difficult just because of the position sizes you have to take.  This reason alone is why the little guy still has a built in advantage over institutional traders who have to move around very large amounts of money to be worth it.<p>I don't know if these guys are charlatans or not, but there are guys and gals doing similar things making similar returns consistently.",1269864425

What makes it a little different however, is all of the exercises are graphed on 1 chart, so you can see correlations between increasing weights etc. I might also add body weight as a base line measurement as well as more charts showing other stats (average monthly increases etc.).<p>URL: http://liftrr.com<p>I'd appreciate any comments/suggestions etc.<p>Thanks!<p>-Elliot",1269864304

(It is already known to suicide researchers that seasonal variation in daylight length is a strong risk factor for suicide, resulting in seasonal variation in suicide rates.) The way to check this conclusion would be to look at other countries (or states in the United States) where policies on daylight saving time have changed over the years. This is not an ideally controlled experiment,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>but suicide data are gathered by a standard World Health Organization methodology all over the world,<p><a href=""http://www.who.int/topics/suicide/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/topics/suicide/en/</a><p>and when other national policies change in a country, or differ between countries, it can be useful to look at whether or not those policy differences make a difference in suicide rates. Sleep regulation is well known to be an effective treatment for mood disorders, so this is a plausible correlation to look at to see if there may be a causal relationship between the policy and the medical outcome.",1269864228

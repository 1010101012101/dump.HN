Then I realize the MDN article actually explained proxies and what they&#x27;re designed for way better than this article (they&#x27;re meant as a functional hook when manipulating properties on an object).

The flip side is that the copyright may be purchased &#x27;into the public domain&#x27; by simply paying the full amount of the copyright to the owner of the copyright. (The owner has no right of refusal; however, they may increase the value of the copyright by paying the difference in taxes.)<p>For patents, have the tax be $300 for each year of the age of the patent.

It could be the same object, or a freshly-allocated object, or an object that exists already. The index operator could be on a list, dictionary, or custom class with, again, arbitrarily complex code. All of that code could even be written in pure C for all I know! That single line of code could be a rats nest of a thousand lines of Python, or C, or both. And that&#x27;s not even getting started with the possibility of metaprogramming or creating new classes by wrapping an existing class at runtime.<p>Saying that the snippet is obviously not using method calls is naive.

When the data is on a remote system, you&#x27;re probably talking about 1000000 ns.<p>To combat latency, maybe the best way is not to send the request in the first place? Maybe you can ensure nodes referring to a remote system are duplicated to some extent on multiple remote systems. It could help performance -- or hurt it more, like when you need to modify the nodes.<p>Maybe you should have counters on nodes with connections to nodes on remote systems.

The reduced risk of you getting prostate cancer is as far as I understand it FAR outweighed by the likelihood that at some point you will have liver issues to deal with.  Also, I am on TRT and this is somewhat anecdotal (although many &#x27;bodybuilder&#x27; types that use testosterone support this)  I have noticed the effects on skin mood and hair are stongly related to estrogen, prolactin, and progesterone levels (meaning they should be in the normal range for male or female depending on what your goal is wrt testosterone).  I also agree with the commenter  somewhere on here that mentioned he feels the &#x27;roid-rage&#x27; when he is low.  Also anecdotal but generally agreed upon by the community is that the mood swings come from actual &#x27;swings&#x27; of testosterone (and bad moods are when you are low, they should call it roid-affection instead).  FDA approved esthers in the US (for injection) do not allow precise daily control to mimic the natural cycle, so there can be some very minor mood changes throughout the week (my dr is open minded and lets me pin the cypionate twice weekly) but I would honestly suggest that your friend had some placebo effect goin on there.  As for his &#x27;back-ne&#x27;, I would check my prolactin levels if I had bad acne on my back (sometimes I do get it, and the levels are always slightly elevated... what to do about it is another story).<p>Anyway, all due respect of course and I have much admiration of anyone who goes through such great lengths to &#x27;be themselves&#x27; but please do make sure you are educated on the risks and minimizing them (I remember hearing it mentioned that the patches of estrogen are much easier on the liver than injections but that was from a tv show I think so take it with a grain of salt)  I do believe that you are correct in saying >A significant portion of the benefits are from the estrogen, I just don&#x27;t think you realize how much.  As someone who lost a fair portion of my natural production almost instantly I can say with confidence that even if one were considering to transition to the fairer sex, losing your test without boosting the estrogen has pretty much NO positives except perhaps the reduced prostate cancer risk.",1423143445

The reason is that floating point instructions are executed on a separate unit (the FPU), with a separate decoder.<p>This is not true. On modern Intel CPUs, FP instructions are decoded by the same decoders as all other instructions. As for the rest of the pipeline, the whole point of picking a microcoded instruction is that microcode can emit any ops.<p>> It would make more sense to encode the backdoor on an illegal opcode, i.e. an opcode that under normal conditions would generate a UD# exception, but with the correct values in the registers it would trigger some undocumented behavior.<p>This would only be exploitable through native code, and if suspicions arose, it would be detectable and it would be possible to extract the magic instruction from it.<p>A much better vector is a microcoded slow operation with lots of input bits, and that gets emitted by javascript jits.<p>> Another question is how to hide this backdoor in the microcode. Presumably, at some point someone might stumble upon the backdoor and ask around about it. If the backdoor depends on some &quot;magic values&quot;, it would be relatively easy to spot just by looking at the microcode.<p>Microcode for modern CPUs is signed and encoded in some manner (encrypted?).

And don&#x27;t leak information through other side channels either, like memory cache. Mitigation for side channel attacks is the reason why established SSL/TLS libraries are slower than optimal.<p>From the linked page:<p>> TLS Blacklist<p>> To prevent padding oracle and other timing side-channel attacks, the HeavyThing library employs a TLS blacklist feature. When a decryption error occurs, by default the offending source IP address is added to a blacklist such that no further connections will be accepted for a period of a full 24 hours. Please note that the blacklist is not shared or synchronized between multiple rwasa processes, so what this really means is that -cpu worth of connections will be accepted at most per 24 hour period. Even if this setting is disabled, special care is taken such that no timing information is leaked during MAC failures. During the course of normal operations, decrypt errors do not (and should not) occur so if everyone plays nice with rwasa this setting goes largely unnoticed. It is our opinion that this strategy of automatically blacklisting clients who are tampering is an effective server-side mitigation technique.<p>They try to deal with timing attacks using <i>IP address blacklisting</i>. This piece of software is unlikely to be secure, if that&#x27;s all of the timing channel mitigation they&#x27;ve done! <i>&quot;... special care is taken such that no timing information is leaked during MAC failures.&quot;</i> suggests they&#x27;re doing &quot;something&quot;.<p>There are also other side channel attacks. Like cache timing related attacks when in a shared or virtualized environments. In this scenario, attacker&#x27;s code would be running on same physical server and deducing private keys out of side channel leaks.<p>The best way is to have algorithms that perform constant work and take constant time for public key cryptography. Even if it costs performance. Unless you want to leak your keys in unexpected ways.",1423142211

When it was created, the design docs said Java was a <i>simple, interpreted language with distributed objects</i> and the target hardware was set top boxes. When Java unexpectedly took off, I suspect Sun weren&#x27;t quite sure which ingredients were key to that success but fixated on &quot;simple&quot;. They unlocked a huge market that was unserved at the time: companies that needed a much simpler C++. So that wasn&#x27;t unreasonable. They then spent many years trying to handle customer requests for ever more runtime speed, whilst simultaneously not making Java as complex as C++. Hence the focus on super whizzy optimisations inside HotSpot ... many of which are just undoing performance hits introduced by the simplicity of the Java language.<p>Value types increase the complexity of the language, no doubt about it. Heck, even having a difference between int and Integer increases complexity. When value types come out, I expect much rejoicing from people who need more runtime speed, and a whole lot of confused questions on Stack Overflow from people who aren&#x27;t totally sure about the difference between a value type and a regular class.<p>I also expect to come across codebases where classes were turned into value types more or less at random, or where the style code forbids value types entirely, etc. Java sort of has this problem already where weaker programmers who are using threads just slap synchronized keywords on every method  until the crashes stop. Then HotSpot goes in and tries to figure out if the locks are actually needed or not and removes them at runtime.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m  A++++ in favour of having value types on the JVM and in Java.

For years we could just throw more hardware at a problem, and now performance curves are starting to flatten out.

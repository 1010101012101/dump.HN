Oh and thinking about this some more, a really good input method would be voice-to-text services such as jott. Frankly, I can't imagine you can go too wrong having a lot of variety in input methods. From looking at sites that have done this right (eg. toodledo - check out the input methods they support, their syntax has some similarities to yours), the secret seems to be to have a robust mature API into your system, and then people will be motivated to provide the gateways with their favourite applications even if you don't.<p>Feel free to ping me when you have more to test-drive, my e-mail address is in my profile.",1245401766

But I've also seen success by what you would consider non-social types, the sort that go into a hole, work their tookus off, emerge with something valuable, then sell it through non-social methods like online and mail order.<p>The strongest entrepreneurships I've seen combine different people with complementary skills.",1245400730

From Matt's article I also gather that he sees any formal ""plan"", i.e. a set of steps and activities put together in advance, as something to restricting and necessary.

I liked the fact that I could try without signing up. I liked the fact that it is simple. I liked the popup offer of a super-brief tutorial.<p>So the idea is that you can sms/twitter/email your entries to this thing? If so sure, it could be useful. Personally I use neither twitter nor facebook (yes yes I know, who let Miss Daisy in here) so I would be interested in direct web entry, email and SMS.<p>Basically there are two kinds of personal finance applications that I would consider. My first preference would be for something quite sophisticated like wesabe.com which ideally automatically gets your transactions from your bank and so all you need is to categorise and analyse.<p>But, my bank lives somewhere between the dark and middle ages, and I can not automatically export to wesabe. While they do try their best to allow manual import, I find that is too much hassle especially for a task I would be avoiding anyway. So, the next best thing is something that makes manual entry as-you-go super simple, and I think you have done a good job at that. I would consider your site, even more if there was a syncing iphone app client for browsing the results and inputting data yet another way.<p>Little nitpicks - I did see ""please wait"" more than I would normally like to, and the calendar popup does not share the look and feel of the rest of the design.",1245398872

I have no problem with AT&T charging for the equipment itself but if they advertise ""unlimited data"" than you should get ""unlimited data"" regardless of what screen it's on.<p>Don't get me wrong, I see their side of it.  If people can tether they'll use more bandwidth which will cost AT&T more.  So they want to charge more.  I get the business reasons on their side.<p>But last I checked it was still a crime to advertise fradulently and that's what I consider their ""unlimited data"" plan to be.

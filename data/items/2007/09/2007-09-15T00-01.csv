54776,comment,54732,54775,0,0,rms,,,"The two people that handled his IPO were a pump and dump firm. They are being prosecuted and they are testifying against everyone they know to try and save themselves. They claim that Steve Madden knew that his IPO was being manipulated and that he was guaranteed profit, even if the stock tanked. Steve Madden says he thought it was all legit.<p>It seems like Steve Madden, at the very least, unknowingly enabled these criminals, but it sounds like he will get off because the two testifying against him are incredibly unreliable witnesses.<p>EDIT: Didn't check the date. He pled guilty and went to jail.",1189817550

He made something himself with almost no money
2. He borrowed enough to make some to sell
3. He sold them himself
4. People liked his product
5. He went on to expand and make more shoe products.
6. His company became large and successful<p>Only the bad part<p>7. His past actions came back to screw up his present success.<p><p>",1189816302

For this on the Mac you can use things like SnapzPro and MousePose (take a look at the Firebug screencast).<p>I'm not aware of any companies to use for a full production video. As far as tools go you can probably use any decent camcorder, a tripod (handheld video doesn't look very professional) and some video capture software. There are plenty of options depending on your platform. Once you shoot your video however it should be very easy to outsource the editing if you're not comfortable with it. You can usually find talented individuals in other countries willing to do this cheaply (ask for samples, etc).",1189816141

Why don't they just tell you on page one what his friends did to screw him over? Instead they describe the blue sky and the birds chirping and what the guy had for lunch. ",1189815824
54770,comment,54760,54760,0,0,omnipath,,,"That is not a very good idea. If money given by government is tied to test scores, schools have more incentive to let students cheat than otherwise, for the high scores. You'd be trying to sell them something that at the very least, lowers overall test score averages.",1189815785
54769,comment,54727,54727,0,0,Tichy,,,"Both suggestions fail, because spam is usually sent from hijacked computers. Nothing to prevent the hijacker from hijacking the ""credit card"" and the authentication, too.<p>Also, I don't think it is true that the ""undeliverable"" type of spam had it's origin on the recipients computer. Spammers just put the email address into the sender field, it doesn't imply a compromised  PC.",1189815488

54767,comment,54765,54765,0,0,dhkim36,,,"Me again. Elaborating on my question:<p>I'm thinking about 2 video types: 1) purely screen capture video demo to showcase software OR 2) a full-featured video with people, dialogue, transitions, etc--basically a full production demo.<p>I'm leaning towards option 2. In that case, if I were to do it myself, what are some high-quality software programs that I could use? If I'm looking for professional help, what companies or services would you be able to recommend.<p>In terms of quality, I'm looking to do something pro like Salesforce.com's video demos: <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/products/democ.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salesforce.com/products/democ..</a>.",1189815134

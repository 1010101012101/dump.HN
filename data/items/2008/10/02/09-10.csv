321580,comment,321558,321558,0,0,astrec,,,"Since you've started with Python why not stick with it?<p>Python and Ruby have way more in common than the good natured ribbing the two communities give each other might suggest. Besides which, Java/Python is a very employable combination.<p>Once you've gone a bit further with Python why not try some ruby, then lisp/erlang/ocaml etc. etc. etc.",1222940939

321576,comment,321558,321570,0,0,jwilliams,,,"I can't back up your experience, but it sounds reasonable.<p>That suggests that Python is more orthogonal to Java than Ruby is (er, before I trigger a deep language discussion, I mean much more generally - in terms of application, libraries, userbase, available documentation, examples, etc) - again, it's not something I have hard analysis on, but something I can probably believe anecdotally...<p>So if you're looking for a ""partner"" language, then all that would suggest that Python might be a good option (i.e. less overlap == more complimentary).<p>... That's some pretty rough logic, but maybe something to start with.",1222939700

321570,comment,321558,321561,0,0,litewulf,,,"Every person I know that knows Ruby knows Python while the inverse is not true. Despite liking Ruby, I suggest trying out Python for the larger user base.<p>That being said, one thing that you may prefer about Ruby is that its both more OO than Python (you do len(array) in Python and not say array.size) and more functional, so it may be more consistent with your knowledge of Java while exposing you to all the joy of functional programming.<p>While I'm blabbering, I also suggest you consider learning as many weird languages as you can. I think its usually kind of informative. (I suggest running through a tutorial where you build something in that language so you have a feel for where its strong and weak, and then if you feel extra motivated, coding something up in it.)",1222938840

On the contrary farm out as much work as possible on the client instead of doing it at the server, like sorting tables and stuff. Things like javascript tabs are also worth lot in terms of performance, serve one page that contains the content of 10 pages = less requests to the server.<p>eAccelerator = old skool, why not APC which is the php opcode cache favoured by Rasmus Lerdorf?<p>Why no advice on using a cache in apache or in front of apache to serve static stuff directly from memory?",1222938424

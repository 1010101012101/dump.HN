Their home, their business, their employees, and potentially the rights to any revenues, IP, or equity in the company <i>they</i> founded.

1149078,comment,1148458,1148458,0,0,jonbishop,,,"I am a former Yelp Account Executive; I was one of the people that would call these businesses. I have both positive and negative feelings about Yelp. It was a short stint (November 07 to March 08) because I wasn't very good at the job as I hated the work (though the company itself is fantastic) and didn't believe in the product we were selling.<p>Account Executives (and pretty sure everyone in the sales division all the way up to the VP of Sales) had no direct way of removing reviews (and I strongly believe this has not changed). When I was there, the only way for an Account Executive to have a review removed was to email customer service and provide a solid explanation as to why it violated the review guidelines. And I can tell you that many times it wasn't easy; customer service had strict guidelines to follow and I (and my friends) had plenty of arguments that went nowhere. Theoretically, an Account executive could make friends with a customer service rep or someone on the development team and try to persuade them to remove a review, but this is highly unlikely because if found out, everyone involved would be fired (so there's a huge risk) and I can tell you from personal experience, removing a few reviews is not going to make or break a sale (so it's not worth the risk).<p>While it was a (sometimes extremely) frustrating process, I feel it speaks to how the executives of Yelp really do believe in the integrity of their review guidelines.<p>As for reviews being deleted, I can tell you that in many of those instances, the review has been put in a ""purgatory"" where the system waits until it receives a signal that the review is not actually spam to let it surface back up to users. This happens to both positive and negative reviews; there is no scam going on here to hide negative reviews for businesses that pay and positive reviews for businesses that don't.<p>Why isn't Yelp more transparent about this process and their algorithm? For the same reason Google isn't transparent about their algorithm - to prevent gaming the system.<p>With the frequently repeated story of business owners being told that their negative reviews will be removed, I believe it comes down to a misunderstanding of the sales pitch (the majority of the time). One of the key points of the sales pitch involved moving a positive review to the top of the review order where a positive review would stay for the duration of the contract. This was especially effective for completing a sale if there was a negative review on top (""the first review your customers see will always be a positive one""). So if a business became a Yelp advertiser, the review order would change, but only with that one review that was moved to the very top. No reviews were deleted or otherwise manipulated.<p>Why do I believe it's a misunderstanding on the business owner's part far more often than a mistaken or even purposeful effort by the Account Executive? For one, Yelp is pretty damn serious about their rep and will fire anyone caught doing this on purpose right away. Also, Yelp's training was good when I was there and has become phenomenal since I left so I don't see many mistakes happening. Finally, and I'm not going to butter this up, there are a LOT of business owners out there who don't understand the web and plenty who are just plain dumb (Just because you own a business, doesn't mean you should). the majority of businesses we called are one off restaurants/bars (just look at the majority of restaurant websites), little retail stores or one man service shops.<p>Yelp is about the customer first and businesses second; because of this, there are always going to be business owners who feel screwed. With all that said, though, I feel that this latest lawsuit speaks to a huge problem that is only going to get bigger for Yelp as it gets closer to an IPO unless they significantly change their business pitch.",1267044575

The question is just how efficient, if it's as efficient as the large centralized power plants we now build then we don't have to waste money on building and maintaining power transmission lines.<p>If I remember my thermodynamics correctly, the efficiency of a heat engine is constrained by the internal temperature of the engine. The higher the internal temperature, the more efficient the engine can be. This is the basic reason why we build as large power plants as transmission loss allows. With a smaller plant, the engine temperature is much lower for practical reasons, hence the loss in efficiency. (Many other economies of scale reasons.)<p>So if this device can really beat the efficiency of our current centralized natural gas burning plants, then this is revolutionary.

You stated:<p>""This is a bill that proposes to give US venture capitalists the overt ability to terminate the residency status of founders and their families.""<p>True in the sense that if the sponsored entrepreneur was unable to fulfill the job creation, capital investment, and revenue generation terms, then they technically were unable to create a successful enterprise.  Any foreign 'entrepreneur' worth his salt should and must know of this requirement and in the awareness of it, must have prepared himself and his family for the consequences.<p>As for part (A) ""...the qualified venture capitalist or qualified super angel investor who sponsored the entrepreneur failed to meet the investment requirements...""<p>I think this refers to the initial requirements that needed to have been met before the foreign entrepreneur is approved for residency.  It could be that the VC committed to the investment (That IS a bitambiguous, but from experience, immigration officials will approve an application and give you a chance to fulfill a financial commitment some time after the sponsored entrepreneur has arrived, provided they are satisfied with whatever guarantee docs you've filed with them.) but was unable to fulfill it, so Homeland Security will start the process of terminating the permanent residency status of the sponsored entrepreneur.<p>Can this be twisted around by an 'evil' VC?  I believe any system CAN be abused around given enough motivation.  In this case, if I were an evil VC who convinced Mr. Chatroulette founder from Russia to come to America to blow his idea up 1000x through me, I'd bring him in, dupe him into signing his life away in a 'partnership', promise Homeland Security that I will fulfill my financial commitments, squeeze everything I can from this naive new sponsored entrepreneur in the 6mos-1yr that Homeland Security will take to enforce my commitment, then not pay up.  Back to Russia goes 'sponsored entrepreneur' and his concept/resources stay here in the US.<p>Bottom line for all parties, due diligence.  I believe the bill is being put forward in good faith.  I believe that they believe it can create jobs.  I believe that it is possible it can.<p>But all things considered, I'd rather concentrate resources on finding the cream of the crop in the US and helping THEM.",1267044249

Even if that isn't true, the fact that it's kind of hard to tell why Yelp is displaying things the way it does feeds that sort of perception.",1267042093

There might be some metaphysical facts you can prove by argument, but I doubt it.<p>You could even argue that metaphysical statements are meaningless, though you run into problems going too far that way as well.",1267042036
1148934,comment,1148458,1148805,0,0,jeff18,,,"That's not exactly my point.<p>Yelp has many <i>easy</i> opportunities to be a shady company and raise its profit margins in ways that are 100% invisible.  For example, they could claim that an ad impression got twice as many views as it actually did and there would be no way to call them on it other than a few internal potential whistleblowers.<p>However, running a blatant extortion scheme where there is inherently a huge paper trail is not one of those things.  Any one of the millions of businesses could become a whistleblower simply by posting an email to Hacker News, and Yelp would go from a near billion dollar company to a fraction of that.<p>It saddens me that if someone accused my startup of doing something absolutely atrocious, illegal, and irrational, instead of giving me the benefit of the doubt, it looks like Hacker News would actually say ""where there's smoke there's fire"" and start to rationalize how I am likely guilty given zero evidence.",1267042030

They certainly appear feckless after posting such a strongly worded public statement, and then doing nothing for weeks.<p>I bet the founders are stewing and angry, and the money people are talking about how half a billion dollars a year is a lot of money to give up, particularly considering that number is likely to rise rapidly for years.<p>If I were a Google shareholder, I would want Google in China. As a Google user and believer in democracy, I want them out. Google can't make everyone happy.",1267042005

(SEOBook is the other half.)<p>Most of the HN crowd probably already knows about most stuff I read, considering y'all introduce me to so much of it.  Nothing really jumps out aside from those sites.  Besides, at the end of the day I actually have to do stuff rather than just reading and commenting about it. :)<p>Oh, one thing: Slideshare.  If you get interested in any sort of technical topic, and you don't have infinite budget to attend conferences where people drop their secrets about it, go to Slideshare and view the slides instead.  I've learned so much there is is incredible: everything the YSlow guys have said about front-end performance is solid gold, the recent Startup Lessons Learned conference was a veritable bonanza of good information (expect me to steal more ideas from it), etc etc etc.",1272675590

1309895,comment,1307909,1308139,0,0,strlen,,,"I would very much like a very simple, basic, tail recursion to be available in Java. Not tail call elimination in the same way as is specified by Scheme. It doesn't even require the a JVM change, it can be done by the compiler: Scala does this. You could use an annotation (@Tailrecursive) to verify that it happens (or error out).<p>C does this with ""-O2"" (factorial is a bad example, unfortunately as there are algorithms that are much more naturally defined in terms of tail recursion):<p><pre><code>  long factorial_helper(int n, int acc)\n  {\n      if (n==1)\n          return acc;\n\n      return factorial_helper(n - 1, n * acc);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nbecomes:<p><pre><code>  factorial_helper:\n  .LFB16:\n      jmp .L8\n      .p2align 4,,7\n  .L6:\n      imull   %edi, %esi\n      subl    $1, %edi\n  .L8:\n      cmpl    $1, %edi\n      jne .L6\n      movslq  %esi,%rax\n      ret\n</code></pre>\nLooks very similar to what my own assembly would look like. Now with -O4 the assembly becomes completely unrecognizable (which is why higher level languages may be faster than lower level ones).<p>Continuations would be another improvement possible at language rather than VM level, with same effect (allowing efficient <i>and</i> elegant implementation of some algorithms).",1272675484

I see your point of view regarding Posterous and I can respect it although I disagree.<p>IANAL, but I think the only reason that a website offers terms of service (beyond any minimum legal requirements they must live up to whether they like it or not) is to give the appearance that they’re nice guys that care about their users. That makes users feel good; it’s a PR decision. But the business doesn’t have any obligation to make its users feel all fuzzy inside about the service. It’s just that it’s usually in the best interests of the business to do so, to the most reasonable degree possible.<p>And it’s good that business don’t have this obligation, because users can be stingy and irrational.

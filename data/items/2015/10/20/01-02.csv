Think of a drug that has a well known mechanism of action like beta blockers (they block the beta form of the adrenergic receptor).  Go one step further and find a beta-1 antagonist like atenolol.<p>Now look at the binding constant across other receptors.  The selectivity can be relatively small!  A beta blocker will often bind with relatively high affinity to another 5 or 10 receptors!",1445306394

Large C++ projects take minutes to compile even on the fastest machines available. Plus, you&#x27;d need to buy one for every developer.<p>> <i>when you have a 2000-line Go project, in language X you&#x27;d be able to cut 500 lines from each half of it considering each half in isolation - and then you&#x27;d be able to cut some more because of things that were common between the two halves - so you&#x27;d end up with just 750 lines of language X.</i><p>While this is true in theory, in practice I think the effect is not quite as large. As the project grows, developers take ownership of certain parts of the code and become ignorant of other parts. This is the whole point of abstraction. Under these conditions it will take a heavy investment of time and effort to find and replace the things in common between the two halves. So you might cut 250 lines in common between two 1000-line halves, but you&#x27;re not going to cut 25,000 lines in common between two 100,000-line halves without a serious amount of work.<p>I think Go&#x27;s design shows awareness of this effect. The Go literature does not preach the battle against code duplication as strongly as, say, Java. The goal is to make it easy to understand the other team&#x27;s 100,000 lines, even if that comes at the expense of some code duplication.<p>Note: I am not a Go programmer, but I do think that optimizing for ``code entropy&#x27;&#x27; (lack of duplicated code) over all else is a mistake.",1445306295

For much use, that&#x27;s as much connectivity as I need, though the ability to access a <i>very</i> small set of tools while in motion (mostly transit/navigation related) would be useful.

10416970,comment,10410900,10415151,0,0,xavils,,,"Thanks for the concern. The logic behind the scenes goes like this:<p>- You pay 20K for a house.<p>- You owe 80K + 80K * 2.5% * 40 years. That&#x27;s your total debt.<p>- If you want to cancel the mortgage, you must pay 80K, and your net worth will go up because you do not have the 40 year mortgage anymore (even if you just paid 80K).<p>- If you buy and sell one year after, the same happens with mortgage towards your net worth. In terms of savings, during 1 year you will get approx 600 * 12 rent, -350 * 12 mortgage. That&#x27;s 3K more. Then your remaining savings will go up 1% (as savings account return) which is around 200. Last, Since it&#x27;s a boom in the economic cycle, while your debt will have diminished, the value of your house will have increased. So basically you sell the house for more, owe less and that is the result.<p>This situation is what makes the world go crazy over real estate, become overbought and then, BOOM.

10416964,comment,10414375,10416426,0,0,dfox,,,"Actually, the card number is signed by issuer&#x27;s certificate for exactly this reason. The same signed datastructure can also contain card&#x27;s own public key(s) when needed by the used EMV implementation. There can be signing key that is used when card generates signed data files internally (I&#x27;ll admit that I have no idea what that is good for) and second RSA encryption public key that is used for some card holder authentication mechanisms (eg. for encrypting PIN sent over cable from PIN pad to the actual terminal).<p>One important point in this is that nothing from this PKI mechanism is involved when the card generates the final transaction signature (called &quot;Transaction Certificate&quot; by EMV). Standard does not specify mandatory algorithm for that and also such algorithm necessarily has to be some kind of truncated symmetric MAC, as the resulting value has to fit into 32 bits (and ideally contain only BCD nibbles). There are some recommendations about what algorithms can be used for that in the standard also with recommendations about key management for the symmetric part.<p>The MitM essentially has no idea about EMV whatsoever and only traps one command and returns fixed OK response. Due to way how the card holder verification process works this results in terminal thinking that the entered pin was correct, while card thinks that no PIN was required for transaction (the idea there is that terminal and card calculates what verification methods they deem sufficient depending on various parameters of transaction and their internal state). While these two states are obviously different, they are encoded by same binary pattern in transaction flags (there is bit that means &quot;verification failed&quot; and nothing that encodes whether the verification was attempted or even what method was selected) and thus the terminal&#x27;s view of transaction matches the signature generated by card.<p>Interesting point in this is that the card usually allows the transaction even without the verification succeeding. Idea behind this is that the transaction can be downgraded to card+signature by the terminal for various reasons (standard specifies list of some reason codes that contains reasonable things like &quot;hardware problem with keyboard&quot; but also &quot;cardholder does not know the PIN&quot;).<p>In it&#x27;s entirety the protocol is designed not to be absolutely secure, but to be efficient, reliable and provide usable audit trail for later review that is usable to unequivocally assign blame for disputed transactions. Essentially only problems with EMV from security standpoint come from complexity that is motivated by the reliability and backward compatibility requirements.<p>By the way there are certainly better workarounds for this vulnerability that testing whether card with no selected application responds to pin verification command that can be implemented on the card side, but they reduce reliability (eg. disallowing offline PIN verification, disallowing transactions without cardholder verification...). On the other hand these workarounds really solve the issue, while testing from protocol peculiarities by the terminal can be worked around by the attacker by implementing better MitM chip that tracks state of the original chip.<p>Arm&#x27;s race between phone companies and phreakers who emulated payphone EPROM chipcards that involved things like the phone measuring various impedances of the card pins and finally ended with deprecating the whole thing (either by migrating to true smartcards or by simply discontinuing the cards, or even payphones) should be enough to convince anyone that authenticating devices by means of implementation details only slows the attacker down.",1445305664

If companies are not going to be thoughtful about interviewing, candidates can either reject those companies, or prepare for those interviews. My belief is that if more candidates are professionally prepared with those closed-ended questions, this will eventually force companies to be more thoughtful.<p>[Us: <a href=""http://interviewkickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://interviewkickstart.com</a>]",1445303909

Sure it&#x27;s a much smaller country with only about 25 banks (about six banks have most of the accounts).  The key here is that every account number has the same format and is unique across the country, and the banks co-operate to make transfers easy.  Paper checks are so rare you can shop for weeks and never see anybody pull out a checkbook.  A debit card system (EFTPOS) was live in the 90s and all of the big consumer banks supported it; soon most shops supported it too. If you are using the web, paying somebody in a different bank is as easy as if they were at your bank.  If you pay somebody at the same bank as you the money transfer is nearly instant; if they are at a different bank it may take 1-2 days.<p>It&#x27;s not fair to compare a country of 318 million with a country of 4.5 million, but a little co-operation between the big players might be a good start.  New Zealand&#x27;s banking co-ordination was the result of an industry consortium, not a government agency.",1445303789

The official docs for the discovery board don&#x27;t give you crucial information about jumper settings, and I ended up having to download some bloated Windows tool from STM just to output a suitable .ld script for the STM32F030K6.

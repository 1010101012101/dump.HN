With DVCS the change control authority can avoid having to interrupt development workflow as much, which is a good thing.",1227635870

376558,comment,376168,376404,0,0,timr,,,"I don't agree with you that branches are unimportant, but I do agree that the emphasis on branching was a bit of a red herring.<p>Apparently a lot of Git users haven't heard, but you can branch in Subversion, too.  That's why ""svn merge"" exists -- it's a core feature!  Yes, you have to remember the branch point and change directories to do it (and I grant that this is slightly annoying), but in my experience, the results are equivalent.  You still have to resolve conflicts at about the same rate as with any other revision-control system.  And the annoyance that Git saves you (by remembering the branch point and saving a 'cd'), is <i>more</i> than offset by the extra complexity of multiple masters, obtuse commands, non-local branches, and the oddball, multi-stage commit process.<p>To me, the extra complexity of Git is only justified when you're working on a project that has multiple, far-flung contributors who frequently work offline.  Otherwise, to extend the author's metaphor, using Git is a lot like having a good set of work pants -- but wet, with sand in the crotch.",1227634782

376556,comment,376486,376486,0,0,Brushfire,,,"I still cant figure out why we are bailing out financial companies instead of bailing out consumers directly. I realize Obama is going to do some sort of tax rebate again, but it seems like it would be more straightforward to take all of this money and use it to pay off American taxpayers credit cards, mortgages, student loans, etc. And it could be done in a fair way, capping the payments at the amount of taxes you paid in the last couple years, and capping payments for people above 100k income or something.<p>This would solve the financial problems of the companies because, ideally, less consumers would be defaulting on loans and would continue their normal business. On the other hand, leaving consumers out of this whole deal doesn't help the taxpayers and continues to burden them to pay both debts and higher taxes.<p>I'm no economist, but knowing that I'll be paying for these bailouts later on regardless (through taxes), I'd rather skip the filtering through a few handfuls of failing companies and just go straight to the source. If there is some solid reasoning for this, I'd love to read about it. Everything I've read seems to just assume that bailing out the corporations is the only way, but doesnt really provide any critical discussion of why.<p>Brian",1227634680

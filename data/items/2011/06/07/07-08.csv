The point I was making is that that's the only point of vulnerability, there is no way to gain access to every private key from some central point.<p>For example, let's say you collected a large amount of https traffic by listening in on wifi hotspots or such like, then you attacked a certificate authority and managed to gain access to everything they have. This would be very bad, but you wouldn't be able to decrypt the traffic you'd recorded because you still wouldn't have each of the private keys used. That's very different from the problem of RSA tokens. Gaining access to RSA's servers resulted in compromising every token. Decentralization is often key to security.",1307432793

So I'm glad features are not the only thing being added with this release.<p>With respect to the Vim vs PyCharm Discussion. I think Vim is great. It's fast, light, and you can customize the hell of it (if you're patient). With that said PyCharm is also great. After you start it up, it is also fast, and you can also do a whole bunch of customizations. At the end of the day, I'm gonna use the tool that is going make me more productive. For me that tool is PyCharm. Now I know some of you are just as productive on Vim, and more power to you guys. However, I would say it would be reasonable to assume that most of the population (of programmers that is) would be more productive through the extensive set of tools that have been so thoughtfully implemented into PyCharm. So my advice is to use the app that makes you crank out good clean code the fastest. I also recommend for everyone to at least give PyCharm a test drive by using the trial, specially if you are a Django developer.",1307432197

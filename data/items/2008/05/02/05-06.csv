179258,comment,178655,179097,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"In investment banking, you usually work on a small team of 3-6 people. The work day is very different depending on whether your team is currently working on a deal or is between deals and pitching clients.<p>If your team is on a deal, then there could be honest-to-goodness work keeping your team busy for 100 hours a week. Tasks include preparing the materials used to market your client to potential investors (including financial models, presentations, and dense official offering documents), managing and attending meetings with investors or the Board, running down data requests, and diverse other things.<p>Most of the bullshit work comes in when a team is between deals. During this period, the senior members spend a lot of time working their connections at potential clients while the junior members prepare ""pitches"" - presentations designed to convince a company to do a deal. Junior employees are expected to be at the office when their superiors arrive and stay at the office when their superiors leave. When I was working, I might start a typical day by finishing up a request from the day before, then have absolutely nothing to do for 4 or 5 hours, and then receive and turn around assignments from sometime in the afternoon until the evening. The boss would make his last calls around 7PM, which is when I would get my last batch of work for the day. I would work on that for anywhere between one to thirteen hours and then head home (or not, if it was 13 hours).<p>The culture at an investment bank is very unforgiving. An employee must be a competent worker to survive, but he must also be sure to keep up appearances. Half of an employee's pay is paid in an annual bonus, which is determined by a mixture of objective and subjective factors. It is not enough to be a good worker, an employee must also make sure he looks like a good worker - which entails being seen in the office a lot. The time of a junior employee is not considered valuable, since they are well overpaid compared to their peers their bosses feel like they should be willing to take unlimited shit without bitching. Managing Directors think nothing of asking an Analyst to do something on Sunday when it pops into their minds, even if the work could easily wait until Monday morning. An MD will also have no qualms about asking an Analyst to start on something at 7PM when he could have told him about it hours earlier. You have never seen so many bitter 23 year-olds as you can find at an I-Banking office.<p>In exchange for most of your life, an entry-level employee is usually compensated well for someone just out of college. I'd estimate the mean analyst on the street earns $120K in an average year. I wasn't on the street, but I'm not working right now thanks to my savings from my days as an I-Banker. If I could do it again, I probably wouldn't. I like where I am but those were a bleak, desolate 2 years and the angina hasn't completely faded away yet.",1209707635

179250,comment,179062,179204,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been surprised to note that a large number of people I've met with bad ideas are following them because they lack the ambition or the ability to execute on their better ideas.  So they go after a market that's too small to be worth addressing, because they can see how to get there, without realizing that <i>no one</i> knows exactly how to approach the huge markets.  The only difference is that they're willing to try.<p>Of course, I've also met people who actually are going after big ideas that are bad because they are too big for a startup.  Things that change the shape of the world...it takes a whole market to do that.  So, maybe I'm just making up generalizations just like everybody else.<p>But the point about ""Which would you rather build, your own ideas or someone elses?"" is the most important.  Every time a ""business"" or ""ideas"" or ""product"" guy starts talking about his awesome idea, and he just needs someone to implement it, he's showing himself to be so self-involved as to be intolerable to work with for most hackers--every hacker he talks to has his own ""good"" ideas, but the ""idea"" guy thinks he's got a monopoly.<p>That's all the article is saying, and I've been around startups long enough to know that it's generally true.",1209706589

Instead you focus on using the application and for all you know it's BSD or Linux or whatever under the hood but you're managing it via a web interface so you don't care.<p>to your 2nd question- JumpBoxes support the major virtualization technologies right now: VMware, Parallels, Xen, Virtual Iron, MS Virtual PC and Virtual Server. They'll also run on KVM, Qemu and Virtual Box though we don't officially support those.<p>I'm glad you dig what we're doing.  If you try one out and really like it I would welcome any suggestions you have on how to better spread the word. We have this weird challenge where the people who use it rave about how great it is. We're not at a loss for a killer product- we're challenged in how we spread awareness of its existence.<p>thanks again<p>sean",1209704815

When they were together at the premiere of City Lights, a crowd rushed their car to get a better look.<p>A confused Einstein asked, ""What does it all mean?""<p>Chaplin replied, ""Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.""",1198071968

Surely, it would have been beneficial to hang one of the people instrumental in developing the atomic bomb for exposing flaws in the security at Los Alamos.",1198069804
91121,comment,91005,91005,0,0,pchristensen,,,"For each name you want to try, follow these guidelines:\n1) say it out loud to ten people and ask them to spell it<p>2) keep talking to them for about a minute, then ask them if they remember it<p>3) write it down for ten people and ask them to pronounce it<p>If you get less than 90% right on #1 or 3, your name will get lost in translation and people won't be able to find it even if they want to (or, you'll have to make a lot more impressions before people start remembering you).  If you get bad results (probably won't be as high because of peoples' memories) on #2, your name it probably to long to remember or not differentiated enough. <p>Rules to Remember:<p>1) Easy to spell correctly if heard<p>2) Easy to say if read<p>3) short = easy<p>4) real words = easy (but usually conflicts with #3 because of availability)<p>5) Don't be blatantly about your business, but related and give hints (Xobni and Auctomatic are good examples of doing this right - much better than emailsocialnetwork.com or auctiontools.com)<p>6) Getting a domain name that doesn't follow these should be considered a marketing expense, because you'll have to make more impressions in order to get planted in people's consciousness.<p>\nHere's my take on some YC company names<p>Loopt - probably lost some people who thought it was looped, but only 5 letters and one syllable so it's easy<p>Weebly - weird word but hard to get wrong, good name<p>Xobni - like Loopt, probably lost some people looking for Zobny, Zobni, but the ""inbox"" thing makes it easy to remember<p>Wufoo - probably the hardest one (on this list) to get right, but being short is a virtue<p>Auctomatic, octopart - longer names that are made of real words are easier to remember and spell",1198069538

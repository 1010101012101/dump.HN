4615321,comment,4613900,4614988,3,0,gecko,,,"Okay; I get why we're having different experiences.<p>When I'm writing managed code that needs to work heavily with COM, I write it in C++ using ATL, and expose that a level higher for calling from .NET.  This avoids 90% of the issues you're hitting, while making it trivial to use COM from .NET (or, for that matter, any other non-C++ language).<p>The good news is that WinRT does legitimately solve most issues managed languages have.  To me, far more importantly than WinRT's ability to export full-blown classes, is its ability to export much, much richer metadata, providing a straightforward way to work with WinRT objects from any language that can process the new metadata format.  No more secret enums in header files, no more HRESULT insanity (HRESULTs are transparently mapped to exceptions).  Just clean, cross-language calling.  We've finally realized the original promise of COM.<p>Of course, that goal was met by ""cheating.""  In my opinion, Microsoft achieved their goal merely by pushing the abstraction layer further into C++.  In practice, I think that's an overall win--it certainly makes most of your points about using COM from managed languages moot--but it also means that your ""native"" libraries are going to be significantly more WinRT-specific.  Or, if you prefer: instead of writing an ATL jacket to make the COM interface clean for .NET, I'll instead write a WinRT jacket to make a C++11 library clean for .NET.<p>The more things change...",1349401711

How can they do that?</i><p>A writedown (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-off#Writedown"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-off#Writedown</a>) means that they are revising the previously announced value of an asset they own downwards. It means the actual value of the asset has turned out to be less than they thought. It's important to investors because the value of company stock is based in part on the value of the company's assets, so if one of those assets turns out to be a lemon, the value of the company overall is less than it was, which can drive the stock down.<p><i>how does this influence/affect the guys that came with the acquisition?</i><p>The article says that the last $30 million of the acquisition price was structured as an ""earn-out,"" meaning that to get it the OMGPOP unit would have to have met certain mutually agreed-upon performance benchmarks. If the value of OMGPOP today is that much less than it was six months ago, it's unlikely they've hit those marks, so that payment probably won't happen.<p>For rank-and-file employees who didn't have an ownership stake in OMGPOP, there's less impact except insofar as it shows OMGPOP not performing, which increases the chance of Zynga dumping the unit, shaking up staff, bringing in new managers, etc.",1349401339

'' : ' fizz') + (i % 5 ? '' : ' buzz') || ' ' + i; }).slice(1).join().slice(1); }<p>185 characters<p>Edit: If I move from a general solution to only 1-100 and remove spaces and semicolons:<p>new Array(101).join().split(',').map(function(j, i){return (i%3?'':' fizz')+(i%5?'':' buzz')||' '+i}).slice(1).join().slice(1)<p>Down to 126, but a lot of that is related to precision with the whitespace and handling a JS quirk with map on undefined values; without the extra joins/split/slices, it goes down to 83 characters (but also doesn't work).",1349398942

4615220,comment,4614287,4614871,3,0,wwweston,,,"> lets not have to go over this again<p>Well, since you've clearly been over this more carefully than most of us, maybe you could be troubled just a bit to elaborate on these questions one more time:<p>* Is it clear that the kind of data that craigslist published can in fact be ""owned""? Because no matter what their terms claim, the legal analyses I've read aren't positively conclusive.<p>* Why is what Padmapper did any different than a search engine? Contrary to some assertions, PadMapper was <i>not</i> republishing listings wholesale -- they published digests (making the ownership issue even less tenable) along with hyperlinks, which sounds a lot like a search engine to me (pretty much what they are). Or even a typical anchor tag itself: the contents of such a tag are generally a digest, the attribute presents the hypertext.<p>* If you agree these activities are something people shouldn't be able to do without permission, are you fine with a web where search indexing or even linking is essentially by agreement only?  This is not an academic question, btw -- there have been lawsuits over linking: <a href=""http://www.salon.com/1999/08/12/deep_links/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/1999/08/12/deep_links/</a>",1349398910

I regularly see about .025-0.5% of Kindle's purchased via my affiliate link being returned.<p>My numbers only represent about a month's activity, but if the numbers are anywhere close to what this article suggesting I would have expected to see at least ONE return out of 44.

3308433,comment,3308128,3308128,3,0,LeafStorm,,,"Let's think about this for a second.<p>The Abrahamic religions (which are the ones that the author is skewering here) teach that all humans are made in the image of God. This implies that (a) human life has inherent value, and (b) humans have a moral responsibility to God. This means that people have a reason - really, an obligation - to be compassionate towards each other.<p>On the other hand, an atheistic worldview backed by determinism implies that (a) humans have no more intrinsic value than a tree, and therefore (b) humans don't have a moral responsibility to anyone. This means that there is no real reason for people to be compassionate to others.<p>So, religious people with a proper understanding of their religion's doctrines should be far more compassionate than equivalent atheists. The fact that we don't see that compassion borne out can be attributed to three factors:<p>First, there are unfortunately many religious people who have bought into the ""Gospel of Ben"" - ""God helps those who helps themselves."" This isn't actually anywhere in the Bible, Ben Franklin made it up. And unfortunately this is something that appeals a lot to politicians.<p>Second, many religious people believe that charity should be handled by church, and not by the state. They also believe in separation of church and state and the limitation of state power, which were actually principles developed by Christians. The author is committing a fallacy in assuming that all charity must be state charity.<p>And third, many ""organic atheists"" are still operating based on their conscience, which the atheistic worldview does not actually have room for. There cannot be a supernatural conscience if there is no supernatural, and evolution has no solid way to explain the development of a moral system that goes <i>against</i> survival.",1322938326

You seem to have exactly zero clue about the origins of copyright. Since I've explained this countless times here already, let me just quote myself from an older comment of mine:<p><i>The fact is, copyright was never meant for creators. It was invented by distributors for distributors. The first copyright law was a censorship law to limit the amount of books printed when the printing press was was getting widely available in England that gave a total monopoly on publishing to a guild of publishers, without even attributing a book to the original author, but instead to the guild member who registered the book, attaining its newly invented ""copyright"".</i><p>So no, copyright was never meant to ""make it possible for an artists to make a living"".<p><i>>Copyright is the only proven way of producing an abundance of art CREATED FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC.</i><p>Proven? Your throwing around fallacies here. There's nothing proven about this, it's quite the opposite already. Unlimited sharing has enabled the creation of more art than ever before.<p><i>>I think it should be possible for a writer, musician or developer to make money from ACTUAL creative work</i><p>If he or she can find a way to make money from it, sure why not. The point is, you cannot make that money with distribution anymore. That's a reality and there's nothing you can do about it.<p><i>>Do we really want a system which rewards the creation of tangible products like tables and haircuts, but not the creation of ideas? In the 21. century? Seriously?</i><p>Again your throwing completely unrelated things together.<p>- A table is indeed a tangible good. You make one, then you can sell it, and have to make another.<p>- A haircut is not a tangible good, it's a service. The hairdresser gets paid for the work he/she has done.<p>- The creation of art isn't a tangible good either. It's best likened to a service, except many people do it proactively instead of waiting for someone to pay them to create art.<p>Yes, we as a society should find ways to reward the creation of art. Copyright <i>is not, and never was, the solution.</i><p><i>>Environmental regulations also create artificial scarcity.</i><p>Except there already <i>is</i> scarcity in nature. If there would be an infinite amount of fish, it would make no sense to regulate catching. Huge abundance != no scarcity. With reproducible art, there is truly no scarcity.",1322937283

The point of essay writing, or doing quadratics or reading about the Civil War isn't about getting a good grade, it's about learning something new, retaining that new information and applying it to future learning. The method of grading and class structures (in that a D-level student starts another year/semester with a clean slate along with all the A-level students from the previous year/semester, despite their obvious deficiencies) is insane when you think about how people actually learn. Grades are a way to motivate through fear of failing, not through interest in a subject. Failure is a natural part of learning and I think people know intuitively when what they're doing isn't working correctly.<p>But then, I'm a fan of the Montessori method, which focuses far more on process and progress than it does specific outcomes at predefined times. It's hard to translate that method to University, which uses the traditional method of grading. The want of grades has actually caused some Montessori schools to include them superficially to appease parents.",1322936179

What isn't evenly distributed are political, economic and cultural systems which encourage highly talented people to build new technologies and companies. The United States has been particularly good at producing this outcome - many would argue that's been the relative apogee among nations/cultures. Personally, I believe that on a per capita basis, it becomes hard to demonstrate that the U.S. is any more innovative than nations like Japan, Germany and Korea.<p>This is not intended to be nationalistic. We simply seem to have become optimized for this outcome. Other outcomes - economic equality, social welfare, work/life balance, overall happiness,  (arguably -  it's a slippery concept after all) are not emphasized as much.

You'd be saying that making money from other peoples work is wrong/illegal, but at the same time <i>saving</i> money by copying without permission is right/legal. In both cases one party is extracting value from the work of another, against their wishes. Seems that the copyright system we have now where the creator is the 'owner'  of the intellectual property and sets the conditions for its disposal has a much stronger foundation.<p>At any rate, surely you'd have to agree that if we changed copyright laws, it would only apply to work created from that point onwards. You couldn't reasonably shift the goalposts for works already published under the guarantee of copyright protection - that would be like raising income tax then applying it retrospectively.<p>So what it seems to me is that people want to have their cake and eat it. They want free access to the works of a copyright funded/enabled culture, but they'd rather not be left with the lacklustre non-protected output.<p>At any rate, let me rephrase my question. Would taking a picture of the print an artist was trying to sell you and then making a copy strike you as a <i>decent</i> thing to do?

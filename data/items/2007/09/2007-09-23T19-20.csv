Perhaps I'm the kind that learns most through failure, but now, the resonance is so much more powerful.<p>While this knowledge would be extremely beneficial for any student of <i>any</i> age, I think the primary difficulty would be in actually feeling the message, as opposed to understanding it. Everybody knows ""practice makes ___,"" but few people act it. The ultimate challenge would be to convey that feeling. Something I'm very interested in :)",1190577315

""Social network"" can mean either a site that lets people socialize with each other or one's actual relationships with other people. It's usually used to mean the former.  ""Social graph"" is used to mean only the latter.<p>""Social networks"" are the application. The ""social graph"" is the data.",1190576802
58596,comment,58558,58558,0,0,tel,,,"I'm no expert, but I'd suggest two things. <p>First, while learning recognize the tricky learning curve and keep poking at complex material as you learn. Macros especially feel dense and frivolous before you see them in action. I'd suggest <i>On Lisp</i> both for being full of excellent examples and free. If you're looking at Scheme, then keep SICP by you at all times.<p>Secondly, more so than in other languages, code to learn. Lisp's parentheses are a turn off to everyone until they reach some critical mass of application and understanding. <p>Learning Lisp reminds me of learning Chinese: the very medium you write with is vastly different from the norm and rather complex, but as you get into it you learn that there is a whole lot of sense to it.",1190576626

Has the view towards the book by the science community changed much in the years since? I'm not a physicist, but have always been interested in Wolfram's work out of curiosity from a comp sci perspective.",1190575881

A few comments on the Haskell:<p>- Line 16 isn't necessary; that if/then/else is handled by the previous case.<p>- You can change line 16 to ""dpll s@(SolverState f r) ="". This both pattern matches the argument (so binds f and r), and binds the whole argument to s. This allows you to remove lines 26 and 27.<p>- Line 22 can be written as ""let n = negate l"".

In the morning do you just cover up, dress appropriately or love fashion? There are businesses placed at many points in Maslow's hierarchy. Software is going to be completely omnipresent and there will be fewer exciting startups tackling problems at the bottom of the pyramid. Look at the facebook valuation.

It's considerably harder to get a designer to create a work to sell on a marketplace that isn't even launched yet or validated by buyers. However, I've made a couple sales (literally, 2) and hopefully I will get more, enough to attract the sellers.<p>I have emailed a few handpicked designers already so I will see what the response is. :)",1328994615

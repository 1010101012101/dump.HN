Their ecosystem is about as far from a competitive market as you can imagine.<p>Their hiring practices might seem illogical, but I would disagree. They're just not hiring for what you think they are. It's fundamentally about hiring people who have a lot of cultural capital coupled with a work ethic and an above-average-but-not-spectacular amount of intelligence. This has only a weak correlation at best with ability to allocate capital, manage, or ""consult."" (Those latter skills are genuinely rare, valuable, and hard to identify anyways, so they're increasingly being replaced by organizational and technical solutions.)<p>Why that group of people? The types of organizations we're talking about are successful because they have secured a privileged place in the network of our economic and political economies. Their target hiring group is people who are consciously or subconsciously supportive of that existing network and will be effective at using and extending it.<p>So, if you had to name a group of people who are generally content with the status quo, familiar with the world of the rich and powerful, hard-working, and smart-enough, who would you go for?

3263641,comment,3262737,3263338,3,0,ugh,,,"Thats nice but also the one negative point about Apple Stores. They are usually packed and many people want to buy something, too many to really handle without a line  yet there isnt one place where a line could form, which tends to lead to confusion. People who are completely new to Apple Stores might moreover not immediately know where to pay what they want to buy.<p>When I visited the Apple Store in Munich for the first time I wanted to buy a 15 gift card but every Apple employee was busy and I couldnt really find a place where I thought I would be able to pay. It seemed like too much of a hassle and that gift card wasnt important enough for me. I wasnt really trying very hard to buy something but I think this shows that packed Apple Stores arent a very friendly place for small impulse purchases.<p>By the way, in the Munich Apple Store they sort of do have a semi-permanent setup on the right at the back of the store. I think a lot more people in Germany still pay cash (I payed my iPad cash  dont ask.) so their nifty cash registers (which are hidden under the tables) are needed more often (they are also not mobile) and there are more or less permanently Apple employees there. If a line forms they will tell you that you can pay everywhere but that doesnt really help a whole lot when every single employee is busy.<p>I think what Apple is doing works extremely well for Stores that arent packed  but if they are it seems to break down a bit.

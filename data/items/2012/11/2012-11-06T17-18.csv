Why should I have a goal in mind when I create? Why should I have deadlines? Why should I sprint? What's the hurry, anyway?<p>When I started writing a 68000 emulator, I did so because it posed an interesting challenge. When I finally got it to the point where I could plug it into MAME and play Rastan Saga on it, I was thrilled. When I got its speed to the point where it rivaled the existing assembler core, I was stoked. And then eventually it reached a point of accuracy and performance that it supplanted the old core and became the standard 68k core in most emulators in use today. Did I have a plan? Not really, other than to try my hand at emulation. Did I have deadlines? Hell no. Did I have metrics? Well, if accuracy and speed counts, then sure. Did I make any money off it? Nope. And you know what? I don't care. I created something of beauty using the skills available to me at the time.<p>That was over 10 years ago.

I think Agile works best when you have a clear understanding of what you're trying to do. If a design strategy hasn't discovered this in Sprint 0 then I think there will be ongoing problems.<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that the whole nature of Agile is that at the end of a sprint you've got some self-contained feature working. I don't think their is anything in the agile philosophy saying that what you have in sprint n will continue to exist in spring n+10. Like code you may refactor as more information comes in. As designers we need to accept that when designing in Agile that what we do 2 weeks ago may not exist tomorrow.<p>I think as designers that's a hard thing to do because we don't like 'waste', we want to avoid re-work and we also like to design the best solution with ALL the information we can get, but doing so requires a lot of upfront thinking and is just taking us back to waterfall.",1352224087

Non-shitty drivers and config interface.<p>I recently switched from 7 to Kubuntu full-time on my primary desktop.  So far the only severe problem I have run into is that when I activate the nVidia drivers, my display becomes retarded.  If I dare to go into the terrible nVidia configuration app, it insists that both my monitors (a 1920x1200 24"" and a 1680x1050 20"") run at 1024x768.  Now, it's not that the drivers can't figure out my displays resolution.  It clearly states the correct resolution for both monitors in several locations.  It's just when it comes to the X Server Display Configuration, it decided to go full retard.  Now, just activating the drivers and not touching the config results in a display that AAALLLMMOOOSSSSTTT works.  Except for the fact that it assumes my smaller monitor is to the right of my larger one, when the truth is the other way around.  And, of course, I can't simply change that setup because that would require going into the configuration app... which will force my resolution down to 1991 levels should I be unwise enough to try to actually use it.<p>I THINK this is caused by the fact that my larger monitor runs at 75Hz while the smaller is 60Hz.  But I'm not sure.  I refuse to plumb the intestinal depths of xorg.conf, most especially because when I install Ubuntu, ITS display configuration works perfectly.  Of course, after installing nVidias drivers it goes out of its way to fuck up Ubuntus display configuration app too.  It certainly seems aggressively determined to make my experience as difficult as possible.",1352222372

I'm not sure what I want to win exactly, either a pat on the back from friends, an e-pat from imaginary friends on the internet, a double take when I tell someone what I did. I'm investing right now in my life, I'm 22 (23 in a week!) and I have no responsibilities. I'm unemployed (haven't looked for jobs, as I don't want to have a boss ever again). I'm investing my time (as I have no money) which is something that cannot always happen. I'm stretching the boundaries of my brain to do the things it can when no one tells me what to do (I like to think of it as wandering in a forest without a compass. It's lonely - none of my friends are thinking about the same problems I am at the depth that I'm thinking about them, but very rewarding. I'm investing to learn things that I will be unable to when I have money.<p>I like to be ignorant as to how hard a challenge is. I watched an episode of numbers last year about prime numbers (not a computer scientist so I did not know many of the complexity things and ways of finding primes, just a lowly self-taught programmer), and boom, off to the races to solve the primes. I never once slowed down enough to say hey... people have been doing this for a long time... just me and a friend trying to be naive and find a route no one found before. I think that's what gives me a lot of momentum, not putting things into perspective, and gives me motivation to keep working. It's awesome to run the show, to stop working when I get bored, to see and understand the smallest to the biggest details in what you're doing. To know the rationale behind all the decisions. Even if they're small ones, and there's only 100 decisions to make, being able to say ""This is why I did that."" and give a specific, personal, reason i awesome, rather than making excuses or attributions for why something did or did not happen.",1352221593

Most of us aren't programmers who need Visual Studio, or to run servers.  So while they may not be getting rid of the desktop (and I don't think they are), it will become less relevant.  I'd wager the majority of Windows licenses sold in five years will be WOA.  The main thing holding ""classic"" Windows in place is familiarity, and as you said, games.  I think Microsoft looks at the Xbox as hardcore gaming and the PC as ""casual"", but frankly when it comes to Microsoft and gaming I don't pretend to understand their actions any more.  I just hope they realize it's one of the platforms largest selling features over competitors.<p>>The author is suggesting that there is a grand conspiracy at Microsoft to lock all 3rd parties out of Windows eventually unless they go through the App Store, and to restrict all Windows versions to Metro mode.<p>You know, I kind of agree.  I don't think there is proof other than ""it's the logical thing for a company to do"".<p>>I'd like some proof to this because it just does not make sense.<p>30% from all software sold is a pretty good reason in my mind.  Microsoft has Apple envy, and for good reason.  Apple is filling swimming pools with dollars right now.  Microsoft already has the market share, in both home and enterprise - I have no doubt they want to take advantage of that.  If they could move those users to a ""faster, safer, easier"" interface where suddenly MS makes a cut of all profit - well, that's a really smart thing for them to do.<p>There's a subtle detail in Windows 8 that makes me look at it this way.  It's the way that the desktop is displayed as an app, like it's there for legacy support.  You don't boot to the desktop, you boot to Metro, your new interface.",1352221223

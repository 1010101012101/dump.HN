However, it is also true that having the right side effects is extremely important - so important that a program with the wrong side effects can easily be worse than no program at all. From that perspective, a focus on minimizing, containing and controlling side effects is very valuable. And an aversion to side effects is a good way to sharpen your focus on that.",1334768280

3858914,comment,3857698,3858073,0,0,billpatrianakos,,,"You're right but I don't think it's a matter of money. It's convenience. Microsoft seems to be going out of their way to keep users of their older products in the dark ages. The other major OS players (Apple and Linux distros) seem to be able to upgrade users of their older products when it comes to things like SNI. I mean, unless I'm seriously misinformed it shouldn't be a big deal to offer users of XP support for SNI and generally allow them to access upgrades that are in the same kind of class (for lack of a better word) as SNI. That kind of upgrade is very different than giving users the kind of OS upgrades that bring better performance or new UI's, various little wizards to help them connect to wifi, etc. The latter type of upgrade is why an average user upgrades a system, not because of under-the-hood stuff like SNI so giving it to them when they're still such a large portion of MS users isn't going to discourage them from upgrading to Win7 or whatever new thing they come out with.<p>I've been able to upgrade my Mac for about four years now from Leopard to Snow Leopard to Lion without a hitch. If I were using XP I'd probably have to buy new hardware with every upgrade and that's what's stopping people. It's not the money but the inconvenience that stops people. If their XP is doing the bare minimum of what they need it for then they're not going to upgrade to Win7 even if they know about the new ways it makes their life more convenient and how much prettier it is. They don't want to transfer their old important files from one drive to another. That's scary for the average person no matter how easy Microsoft advertises it to be.<p>It feels like Microsoft makes decisions with a heavier focus on marketing than real technical improvements, innovations, or user experience. I mean they make a good product (it's not my cup of tea but I'm not a bigot about it) but they're still operating like they have no competition and it's really screwing with people like us who are trying to move things forward.",1334768104

I can't say that a fan of hip hop music would consider Kurupt to just be the answer of a trivia question. If you are a hip hop fan Tupac's death is more along the lines of Bob Marley, not Elvis. People chose sides during that stupid time in hip hop but mostly everyone who was a real fan in that era respect both Biggies and Tupacs music now that all of the smoke has cleared.<p>While I agree that after death, Tupac image has been ""manipulated"", but it is the fans doing it more than anyone else. They remember their version of 2Pac and casually dismiss his life contradictions. 2Pac made a lot stupid decisions but also had moments of genius. He was the image of youth rebelliousness but too often crossed the cavern of casual disregard of others. That is a thin line and at times he walked it poorly. And now that I am ten years older than when he died I can see why. At 25 years old you do a lot of dumb shit.<p>I think a lot of fans reacted as they did to that hologram because 2Pac has never really had a proper public memorial. Biggie had the big MTV awards spectacle with Puff, a gospel chorus, and Sting. He had big budget movies made of his life, tribute albums and a whole host of other tributes. Basically a lot of chances for his fan to mourn his passing while also celebrating his life. 2Pac has had a couple of tribute albums and a few really low budget documentaries. Nowhere near even especially considering how even they were in stature in both the hip hop and the music community as a whole.<p>Even though I was aware of the tech behind the ""hologram"" and hated a lot of what 2Pac became towards the end of his life I was still amped up and moved by the show. I wouldn't want to see it again because then I would feel his image really was being exploited. But as a DJ and fan of hip hop for about 29 years, I was glad to see it.",1334767953

(Yes, DHS is a monster, everyone knows that; we should definitely slay it).<p>People who have worked on the intrusion detection problem in computer systems are well familiar with the Base Rate Fallacy (what this article appears to be talking about when it mentions the ""false positive fallacy""). To anyone who has actually monitored a deployed IDS, the base rate problem is a killer. <i>Most of the events generated by systems like this  are mathematically certain to be bogus</i>.<p>So it's great to see an Atlantic article trying to tackle the numeracy issue here: DHS policymakers looking for research funding are bragging about a terrorist detection system with a 70% accuracy rate, and 70% sounds great when you leave out the base rate of terrorism.<p>On the other hand: of the LEO functions of DHS, most of them fall into one of two categories:<p>* Departments that already have total discretion to ignore civil liberties, like Customs: it's hard to imagine any new program making Customs more intrusive, because Customs operates under the border search rule (since at least 1976, Customs can set up any search program it wants to protect the integrity of the US border).<p>* Departments that operate under administrative search regimes, like TSA, where ""behavioral monitoring"" is if anything <i>less</i> Orwellian than the systems already in place.<p>DHS research projects do not automatically imply that local and state police will be deploying ""behavioral"" technology to ""pre-crime"" people.

For instance when the government buys Humvees for the army they pay a Firm fixed amount per vehicle because the contractor knows exactly how much one should cost and charges more than that to the government.<p>For a brand new stealth fighter though, there are a lot of unknowns and a lot of development to do before they can build the first plane. The contractor can say ""We think we can do all the necessary research for this with 100 people over 3 years plus $2 billion in additional costs for materials and to contract out the construction of new factories etc. All that added up would be $5 billion (plus $100 million per additional month beyond 3 years) and we expect a 15% return in profit on this development.""

If they were to bid it as a firm fixed price contract they would just say ""we want $3 billion per plane for the rest of time"" and the government would likely overpay comparatively.

One downside however, is you get what the private developer wants - so they're ending up with a train station at Orlando airport instead of downtown Orlando where it should be. Government is uniquely incentivised to do that right because they gain from increasing property values near where the train will go. Unfortunately local developers won't be so nice as to pony up more for that kind of thing even though they will reap disproportionate rewards. Another example - here in Reno, we're trying to build Bus Rapid Transit through a main corridor that is undergoing a pretty great revitalization. People in NV are especially not cool with traditional way for raising taxes for this kind of project (a la 1 cent sales tax just for BRT/streetcar).<p>It begs to ask, if the developers nearby are going to gain so much, why aren't they building it themselves? Too many groups that won't take risk... I mean probably 1,000 people who own buildings there will benefit disproportionately... you are never going to get them together to pony up for a streetcar. But the proof is there... look at Portland for a US example... also Seattle and SF and San Diego. Its just easier to get the government to do it. They should put a local surcharge on property values. Its only fair. However, they will f- this project up I'm sure... just like NASA spent a kabillion extra dollars just to build certain parts in certain senator's home states... and my other local train is going to have a snack bar so the Sonoma County housewives that will never ride the train can get a snack; instead of more seats and bike space.",1334767102

3858789,comment,3857966,3858117,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"> That is, most economic discussions are based on terms that aren't meaningful in any practical way. I see a lot of economists poking at the metrics with their pencils and talking theory while waving their arms around wildly.<p>Actually, the problem is that people infer terms to mean things that they don't mean, oftentimes because the terminology is (regrettably) overloaded, even when the technical meaning is very precise and limited. Understandably, people interpret these terms literally, which sometimes leads to conclusions that seem paradoxical or impractical[1].<p>Remember that economics is really just the study of choices: choices in the small (microeconomics) or choices in the large (macroeconomics).  Choices <i>may</i> involve money, but money is not inherent in economics - it just so happens that there are many advantages to a monetary system, which is why most economies develop some form of currency, and which is also why many (but not all!) economists deal with money. Even though it uses similar terminology, macroeconomics is fundamentally different[2] from microeconomics at its core. One is the study of individual decisions on a small scale, and the other is the study of the non-random patterns of many independent decisions.<p>GDP is not the <i>perfect</i> measure of what it's meant to gauge (macroeconomic economic 'health', which is itself a problematic term). GDP systematically overestimates the health of oil-backed economies with huge wealth disparities, for example. That said, there's no metric that's much better for the general case - all have similar systematic flaws in some way.<p>Furthermore, GDP has the advantage that it's completely unambiguously defined. That doesn't mean it can be <i>measured</i> perfectly, but having an unambiguous definition is a key step. When you start talking about these contrived indices (the 'happiness' index, the 'corruption' index, etc.), you get the problem that there's little underlying justification for the way that the model is constructed, so even if the end results are useful for a particular domain-specific application, they don't generalize well. GDP, on the other hand, can be derived quite easily from first principles, so it generalizes very nicely. Furthermore, GDP happens to correlate very well with most things that we would classify as 'good' (quality of life, corruption, happiness, etc.), so it's a nice proxy for these intangible 'goods' (no pun intended), which are more difficult to measure precisely.<p>So back to your question: maybe the measurements themselves are rigged - that just gets at the question of who is actually doing the analysis. But the construction of the model is no more 'rigged' than any other model. You just have to be careful to know that, like all models, its application is still very limited, even if it's one that we happen to use quite frequently.<p>As George Box says, 'All models are wrong, but some models are useful'. GDP is 'wrong', but it also happens to be by far the most useful way of describing the patterns choices on a large scale.<p>[1] This is by no means specific to economics: it happens in statistics as well, and (to a lesser extent) in computer science.<p>[2] That is to say, they aren't mutually exclusive, but they are based on completely separate assumptions, so principles from the small do not <i>necessarily</i> carry over into the large scale.",1334766802

That is, to say, that the industry has matured to a point in which a significant portion of industry programmers are getting excited about some of the more abstract concepts brought to us through functional programming.<p>Few people will argue that the concepts underlying FP don't take some time to internalize, but the number and quality of FP learning resources is increasing at an incredible rate.  This, alone, makes me skeptical of the author's points  people are going out of their way to create accessible learning resources so that they might share something they find to be useful/interesting.

More importantly, you will experience all three scenarios at different times throughout your career.<p>In regards to the general relationship I keep with my employees, I personally execute and support the ""did the shit that needed to get done, get done"" approach.  Not sweating when someone logged on for the day, when they logged off, where they worked from, did they have beer during the day (my preferred answer is YES).

Many people sent comments. There were three kinds:<p>1) People who were frustrated because they wanted to use Meteor for a project, but couldn't tell if it was allowed or how much it would cost.<p>2) Detailed analyses of legal, strategic, and technological implications of every possible choice we could make. This was AWESOME and was incredibly helpful. Some of the people who wrote in are smarter and better informed than any license attorney I've ever talked to.<p>3) ""You suck, you really screwed this up, you are bad people."" These comments weren't as helpful, but we're still glad to have them.<p>I really apologize to everyone who was frustrated. We thought it was going to be months before anyone was interested enough in Meteor to care about the license. Clearly that was wrong.<p>Licensing is tricky. We're working hard to fix the problem. ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON, we will announce the options for using Meteor in closed-source, commercial software. I think nearly everyone will be happy with the solution. We'll post the announcement on Hacker News, and we'll also send an email to the list.

It turns out the only factor that significantly affects adult income is IQ. Earned income is almost totally uncorrelated with race, skin color, culture, family wealth, family social rank, location of residence, school system, characteristics of siblings, and so forth. IQ also strongly predicts criminality.<p>Studies of twins separated at birth show huge IQ correlations between identical twins, but IQ correlations between fraternal twins are no greater than for sibling pairs from different pregnancies.

Honestly, I like FP extremists better than their OOP cargo-cult counterparts, who have the same smugness but are usually better, in most companies, at getting managerial blessing. In many companies, OOP acolytes glow in the managerial sun like Dudley Dursley, despite the general crappitude of their ideas.<p>""Functional programming"" in the real world isn't about dogmatically eliminating mutable state. It's about <i>managing</i> it. It's about <i>modularity</i>. It's not far from the original vision behind OOP-- before it got taken away by the wrong crowd-- which was that when complexity is inevitable, it should be encapsulated behind simpler interfaces. For example, SQL is append-only (as functional as one can get over a growing knowledge base) if you never use DELETE or UPDATE. The inner guts of SQL are not ""purely functional""-- caching and indexing cause internal state changes, for performance reasons-- but the interface is.<p>I don't even know what endofunctors are. If it's relevant to my job, I'll learn about them, but I care more about writing good software than reciting category-theory arcana. I'm sure it's important (especially as an inspiration for design) for some people, but you don't need to know them to do functional programming. Not even close. And I was already a productive functional programmer (in Ocaml and Lisp) before I even knew what <i>monads</i> were.",1334765926

3858606,comment,3852342,3854418,1,0,sllrpr,,,"> First, let's show that I can write a job that can produce more data that it inputs. I have a map of user to score, and want to compute pair wise summed scores for every user pair. This is clearly O(n^2) outputs. Computing pair wise scores is a common algorithm for recommender systems (I realize in practice you generally do not compute the entire space because it will be too slow. However your output will be closer to n^2 than n, ie, it will be much larger than your input.)<p>But that's exactly it - you admit yourself that this is a contrived example!  For all but trivial numbers of users N^2 storage requirements would be impractical for any system, no programmer in their right mind would take such an approach.<p>And this is the point that you seem to be missing: the question is not whether you can come up with some contrived scenario where there is vastly more intermediate data than input data, but when you can come up with a realistic practical example - and apparently you cannot.<p>> A simpler example is ""I want to compute aggregations on all the fields my log file.""<p>In this case the amount of intermediate data is no greater than the amount of output data.<p>> But again, the point you keep missing and conveniently ignore when you quote my posts is that the point of map reduce on Aws is not about data locality (obviously) but about downstream flexibility. I can run 100 jobs, in parallel, on 10k machines, and output much more data than I input, without running a cluster of my own and I get to pay by the hour. I am isolated from other devs and spin the machines down when finished.<p>These are benefits of EC2, not of map-reduce.  The critique was specific to map-reduce, not of the entire principle of on-demand computing.<p>> If you buy the argument that this is a useful feature (as any EMR customer would attest too)<p>Strawman.  You're attempting to conflate the general benefits of on-demand computing with the specific benefits of EMR.  The author was criticizing EMR in particular, not the entire principle of on-demand computing.<p>> than this too is a separate more pragmatic reason why the author has no idea what he is taking about when he says all EMR customers are a cargo cult.<p>And yet you still haven't been able to cite any realistic, non-contrived examples of where EMR is the appropriate tool for the job.",1334765017

They are not obligated - and won't - provide care to sustain your life.<p>Suppose you have cancer.  An operation costs $100,000.  If you get it within six weeks, you live, otherwise, it metastasizes and you die.  If you haven't got the $100K in the U.S., they won't operate, and are under no obligation to do so.  It's not an emergent condition.<p>Now, 16 weeks later when you're dying, they'll put you in a hospital bed, give you oxygen and morphine, and try to ease you into death - regardless of your ability to pay (though they'll try to get paid from your assets and your family, of course).

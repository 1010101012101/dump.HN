The nice thing about a pair is the way it naturally lends itself to iterative processing: There's the CAR and the CDR, the first and the rest.

Lisps--and even Scheme, which is often incorrectly taken to have as a design goal to be minimalistic to the point of consisting of axiomatic primitives--do not deal in pedantic adherence to theory. Limiting lambdas to a single argument is pointless whereas a cell happens to be minimal yet extremely useful in practice.<p>Other have written lisps atop vectors as the primitive data type.

I've booted my iPad only a few times in the past 3 months.  The rest of the time, it's been in standby mode, and it ""comes up"" pretty much instantly.  It is high contrast/high resolution.  If it's not high contrast/high resolution enough, this is bound to improve.  I've never had a problem with viewing angle or in dim light.  Bright light visibility should improve.  Random access has been good for me, including the use case of using programming books for reference.  There is visual feedback, and I haven't missed tactile feedback.  There are ways to annotate PDFs on the iPad.  The iPad requires no batteries, and the maintenance has been limited to syncing and updating OS software.<p>So, to meet your requirements, the next iPad just has to:<p><pre><code>    - be viewable in bright light\n    - incorporate tactile feedback (or equivalent)\n</code></pre>\nPerhaps improve in these ways:<p><pre><code>    - increased display resolution\n    - reduced maintenance\n    - better annotation</code></pre>",1305557793

It's very hard to explain, Borges explained it best when he said that he hopes ""Heaven is a library"".<p>Second, and I saw that you wrote about that in your blog post, books do indeed ""represent things, places, times, events or ideas to certain people"". I know it happens to me very often to just sit in my couch and look through the titles of the books I've accumulated in my personal library. Half of them I haven't even read, but just reading their titles gives you a special feeling.<p>Last and not least, I still continue to believe that my interest in reading was very much nurtured by me growing in a small apartment filled up with the books that my dad had bought.

It is also the only place I have ever been mugged - twice! - despite having frequently traveled to much more dangerous places.  The second mugger even took my clothing at gunpoint.  And the muggings occurred within 80 feet of the St. Louis Arch and several cops.  Don't go near the Arch around dusk.

2552513,comment,2552180,2552454,1,0,fexl,,,"Although Fexl does have built-in functions for long int and double float values, it is possible to do without them.<p>There are a couple of ways to define integers as pure functions.  One is unary notation, which is equivalent to the ""3"" example you cite above.  So you'd have these two constructors:<p><pre><code>  \zero = (   \zero\succ zero)\n  \succ = (\N \zero\succ succ N)\n</code></pre>\nAnd then the ""add"" would be:<p><pre><code>  \add == (\x\y x y \n succ (add n y))\n</code></pre>\nOr, using the ';' (right-pivot) to avoid nesting on the right (though sometimes that can be too clever by half):<p><pre><code>  \add == (\x\y x y \n succ; add n y)\n</code></pre>\nThat works fine for some applications.  But you can use binary notation as well, defining an integer as a list of bits, with the lowest-order bit first.  Then the ""add"" function becomes:<p><pre><code>  \add == (\x\y x y \bx\nx y x \by\ny\n     \sum=(add nx ny)\n     bx\n        (by (cons F (inc sum)) (cons T sum))\n        (cons by sum))\n</code></pre>\nWhere inc is:<p><pre><code>  \inc == (\x x (cons T null) \b\n\n     b (cons F (inc n)) (cons T n))\n</code></pre>\nI think I transcribed that right, but I haven't tested it in a while.  It's all surprisingly fast -- I was actually doing long division of 100 digit numbers years ago in reasonable time in this notation, including the conversion to decimal notation by repeated division by 10.<p>One of these days I need to link a big number library into Fexl, but it hasn't been a priority for me.  (Actually I need to think seriously about dynamically linked libraries, with linkage control done in Fexl itself.  This can be sandboxed for secure applications, of course.)<p>Oh and here's my old division function, which again I haven't tested in a while, so no warranties expressed or implied:<p><pre><code>  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  # (nat:div x y) divides x by y.  It yields a pair <q,r>, where q is the\n  # quotient and r is the remainder.\n  #\n  # The result satisfies the equation x = q*y + r,  0 <= r < y.\n  #\n  # NOTE:  If you divide by zero, the function yields the pair <0,0>.\n  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nat:div==(\x\y\:\n      x (: null null) \bx\nx\n      y (: null null) \by\ny\n      by\n      (\n          # divide by odd - recur on x only\n          nat:div nx y \q\r\n              \r=(bx nat:2x1 nat:2x r)\n              \d=(nat:sub r y)\n              int:ge0 d\n                  (: (nat:2x1 q) (int:abs d))\n                  (: (nat:2x q) r)\n      )\n      (\n          # divide by even - recur on x and y\n          nat:div nx ny \q\r\n              : q (bx nat:2x1 nat:2x r)\n      )\n  )</code></pre>",1305554534

Like its integration with the other Google services. For instance I love that my whole contacts list is backed-up in Google Apps. And the Gmail app on Android is the best Gmail app available on mobile phones.<p>It's a pity that I'll have to wait for an Android 4 upgrade for my Galaxy S. I blame Samsung for this as I buy from them for the hardware (which is awesome), not for their shitty ""additions"" to Android. This is why my next phone I buy will be a Nexus, or whatever Google's next blessed phone will be called.",1331107178

3674709,comment,3672815,3674406,1,0,learc83,,,">You can't say that prices are high for corporate legal services because supply is restricted<p>I'm not saying that. I agree with you that there is a surplus of corporate lawyers, and so deregulation wouldn't really reduce the price in that sector.<p>Even if there were cheap lawyers who learned through apprenticeship instead of law school, large companies still wouldn't hire them.<p>I'm talking about prices being driven up in other areas, where law school grads with insane debt don't want to work.<p>I know several law school grads who couldn't find the kind of high paying job they were looking for. However, since they had so much debt they ended up taking non legal jobs (one is a project manager, the other an entrepreneur), instead of moving into another lower paid area of the law.<p>Because of high education costs (and the requirement that lawyers posses a graduate degree, which means most of them are going to be at least 25 by the time they can start practicing, plus the psychological factors involved in having spent 7 years in school), there is a minimum price below which most lawyers will not work, and will seek other opportunities.",1331106536

3674643,comment,3674256,3674283,6,0,commieneko,,,"The paintings for the first movie were pre-production visualizations done well in advance of filming. In fact, well in advance of the story.  In the painting of Luke on the cliff looking down on Mos Eisley, you may notice that ""he"" seems a bit wide hipped. That's because at the time this painting was done, the ""Luke"" character was a girl.<p>If I remember correctly, most of the paintings for the other movies were done mainly as marketing and promotional items, for books, posters, and art sets.  I don't think he was as involved with the rest of the original trilogy as with the first.  By then Lucas had a whole army of artists working for him.<p>The original trilogy owes most of its look and feel to McQuarrie.<p>I always liked the original set of paintings, where things looked different and strange.  I actually saw many of them <i>before</i> the movie came out, as they were used to promote the film in science fiction fan magazines. (The first movie came out between my junior and senior years of high school.) The later paintings are much more ""on model"" than the original, exploratory paintings, and not as fanciful.<p>My cousin was a film critic at the time, and somewhere my brother has a press kit that my cousin gave to him that included a lot of goodies, including a very nice, oversized black portfolio of the original set of paintings. I wouldn't be surprised to find it's worth something these days, but my brother and I spent <i>hours</i> pouring over those paintings, and enjoying every detail.<p>It's one of things that got us involved in the special effects industry years later. So I feel I own Mr. McQuarrie quite a bit.",1331104862

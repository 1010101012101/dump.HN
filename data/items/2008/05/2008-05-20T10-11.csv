No questions, please.<p>More seriously, I'm not confident of everything they discuss here, and I think they are cherrypicking.<p>Upvoted because some of it is useful, however. For instance, hurricane number/intensity vs time (Katrina wasn't caused by global warming folks) and computer model uncertainty (they are crap). It's well worth a skeptical read.",1211280014

The fact that it's <i>hard</i> to get info about these people and what they need means that market is yours if you do the leg-work (or phone-work).",1211279741

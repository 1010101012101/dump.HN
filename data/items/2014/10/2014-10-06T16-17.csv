8416906,comment,8414944,8415192,1,0,Houshalter,,,"This position makes no economic sense. Consumers are the end goal of an economy. Workers are just a means to meet consumer demand. Eventually, through automation, we may not even need any workers at all. You can artificially raise wages up to a certain point, but it&#x27;s not at all clear that this is good for the economy as a whole. E.g. unemployment for workers whose labor isn&#x27;t worth that much, higher prices for consumers, etc.<p>A better alternative is something like a basic income. Something that helps all people, not just people who have jobs with high demand. And is payed for by taxing the entire economy, not just businesses that coincidentally employ a lot of workers (or indirectly, their consumers.)",1412614753

This is discriminatory against some personality types.<p>In the balance between using verbally abusive language to more effectively communicate error and not doing that, I believe there&#x27;s no question: verbal abuse is wrong, and should be avoided, and not defended.

From what I&#x27;ve seen, as soon as an enterprise contract is big enough to involve a tender, bidding round and separate purchasing department, agile is impossible. Being agile actually works against you, since regular demo&#x27;s will bring up more opportunities to point out how you aren&#x27;t sticking to the letter of the contract, flexible scope means adding scope and never reducing it, and grooming as you go along means uncovering big requirements which are sort-of-kind-of in the contract halfway through a big project that&#x27;s already late. And those are the easy projects compared to government contracts.<p>I keep wondering how you&#x27;re supposed to negotiate the typical big enterprise contract so you&#x27;re allowed to be agile while executing it.

But that concern is nothing but smoke and mirrors. To invoke &quot;political correctness&quot; is really to be concerned about loss of power and privilege. It is about disappointment that some &quot;ism&quot; that was ingrained in our society, so much that citizens of privilege could express the bias through word and deed without fear of reprisal, has been shaken loose. Charging &quot;political correctness&quot; generally means this: &quot;I am comfortable with my privilege. I don&#x27;t want to have to question it. I don&#x27;t want to have to think before I speak or act.

8416769,comment,8416283,8416592,1,0,jawns,,,"I am a former editor (newspapers and magazines) and now work in tech.  No reputable media outlet that I know of would permit prior review -- that is, allowing a source to see a story before it&#x27;s published.  And indeed, doing so could get a reporter in very hot water, if not fired.<p>So how do reporters, editors, and media outlets make sure that they get their facts right?  By doing some of the things suggested -- confirming statements of fact, asking for clarification, and sometimes repeating back a short quote to make sure they haven&#x27;t misheard anything.<p>But to allow a source to read the whole thing before publication goes way beyond confirming statements of fact.<p>At the first magazine I worked at, I had the liberty of being able to call up sources as I was working on a piece.  I would typically pick out any statements of fact that they had made during our interviews and restate the fact, asking them to confirm each statement.<p>There are typically two kinds of objections, and you don&#x27;t hear either of them very frequently.  One is &quot;that&#x27;s factually inaccurate.&quot;  Those are the easiest to clear up.  The other is, &quot;I never said that!&quot;  That&#x27;s generally not an objection to a statement of fact; it&#x27;s an objection to a statement of opinion that the person regrets making, or a lie that they have been caught in.  I can remember one time that I had a disputed quote on a cassette recorder; we ran with it.  Another time, I had only my handwritten notes, and we decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk.<p>As for this particular blog post, anytime I hear someone accuse a scribe of slandering them or a television/radio reporter of libeling them, I take their accusation with a grain of salt.  If you don&#x27;t know the difference between slander and libel, you probably don&#x27;t know what constitutes either.",1412613367

While all companies do internal dev and iterate a few times, it feel like Apple will keep something internal and iterate on something longer than others. The result is a product that feel more developed. It is often said that Microsoft needs 3 public releases to make some good (i.e. Windows 3.x was the first reasonable and &quot;good&quot; GUI). Apple hides those first 2 internally.<p>Go back and watch the iPhone launch video. Try and remember how crappy phones were in 2007. There are a lot of things the iPhone famously didn&#x27;t have.

For example Jack Welch, the famous CEO of GE, held a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. I don&#x27;t know of evidence that STEM degrees hold people back, even working outside the sciences.<p>2) We don&#x27;t know, in advance, who the next Einstein is going to be. Giving as many children as possible the chance to make great discoveries is just good odds.<p>The chances are that most STEM graduates will not even be a full professor, let alone the next Einstein. But that is largely true of any degree we can imagine. Most English majors will not be a successful novelist or critic. Most business graduates will not run a company. Most history graduates will not become a full professor. Etc.<p>There is a shortage of leadership positions in any field, and a full professor with research funding is a leadership position. I think the most important question is whether the absolute best STEM graduates achieve these positions; that&#x27;s best for society overall. If the postdoc crisis keeps the most promising new researchers from pursuing new knowledge, that&#x27;s bad.<p>But it&#x27;s not a volume problem. For the volume of STEM grads, the question is whether they can achieve at least a middle-class career and lifestyle. That might be in the sciences, but it might not.

Universities charge massive overhead on grants which they use to support non-research related endeavors, place low ceilings on salaries, force investigators to do ancillary tasks like teaching, and don&#x27;t promise tenure track positions.<p>There is no reason why someone couldn&#x27;t create a for profit center which charged half the standard overhead on NIH grants making them very appealing, uncapped salaries, allowed investigators to own IP / arrange for favorable splits in a TLO model, and offered PI status to post docs if they could bring their own grants / industry money. Post docs would have a harder time staffing labs with grad students in this model, but they could get an affiliation with another university or simply hire students with BS&#x27;s and pay them competitive rates.",1412611233

I am quite confident with it, but as far as I know few others used it. At that time, I used pykov with networks of around 100k nodes and 500k links. Only recently I replaced pysparse with scipy sparse solvers. Entire methods are comment out because they are heuristics that do not belong to the standard Markov Theory, and they can be removed.",1412611208

Most of the ones he did find had already been hit by someone using a perl script that made them join an irc channel that was being used as CnC. He also joined it and monitored it.

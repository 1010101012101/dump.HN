For instance, he never says why Chu was wrong to have talked about the possible threat of global warming to California agriculture, he just throws it out there and rhetorically rolls his eyes.  The battle lines are already drawn, and this article is just another volley, easily as political as what it purports to be criticizing.<p>This article has the same feel as one advocating for intelligent design:  argument by incredulity (a billion people dead from climate change, really complex organisms arising from evolution, each just so unfathomable they simply can't be true), a professed rejection of the extremists the author might get lumped in with (id isn't creationism, focusing on capture isn't the same as denying global warming), even though the end policy effect is basically the same as if the extremist's views were adopted (don't teach evolution as fact, don't take real action against global warming).<p>And really, saying that ""Science advisers should stay clear instead of being part of the rabble"", what does that even mean?

E.g. nominal vs structural, compile-time vs run-time, dynamic vs static, polynomial (HM) vs exponential (cartesian), sound vs unsound. Please get yourself accustomed to the type literature, or invent your own glossary, as perl usually does when it has no idea about prior art. In this case it has.<p>From the implementation POV tags are indices into types and used with primitives as tags, hence the name, reserved &quot;bits&quot;, e.g. with 30bit intnums or the many free NaN tagging bits in doubles or normal class slots with multiword objects. They are carried along the lifetime of the variable, hence add critical run-time safety and inherent slowness.",1424804384

Physical security is very easily understood by most if not all users.<p>I am not so convinced about the necessity of periodic updates; firmware is, by definition supposed to change far less often than software; it&#x27;s firm, not soft. For example, motherboard BIOSes were basically almost never updated until manufacturers started using flash instead of EPROMs, and bugs were relatively rare.

- We provide a free community edition of CitusDB for added functionality (e.g. massively parallel analytic queries, distributed joins)
- For enterprises, we provide a sitewide, unlimited license of CitusDB Enterprise. For smaller projects there, we provide support and a per-node license. 
- For start-ups, we provide a flat rate of CitusDB Enterprise irrespective of your data volume.<p>The right approach depends on the company and the use-case. Either way, and given the quick time-to-deployment, any of the approaches should end up as a major cost saver.",1424803699

There are plenty of safer alternatives, though, so there&#x27;s not much point in writing software that way unless you&#x27;re actually trying to create a race.<p>MVars can deadlock, but you can&#x27;t accidentally mutate/read a value without taking the lock (unless you use IORefs in conjunction with MVars).<p>STM handles races by detecting them and re-starting a transaction if a race occurs, so races aren&#x27;t possible.  (Accessing IORefs is disallowed by the type system inside an STM transaction, so you&#x27;re safe there.)  STM also isn&#x27;t susceptible to deadlocks, so it&#x27;s generally the safest option if you need non-deterministic threading, and invoking transactions from the IO monad fits with the structure of your program.<p>There&#x27;s also par/seq, strategies, and the Par monad which are great for parallel computation and aren&#x27;t prone to races or deadlocks.  They can be called from anywhere in a Haskell program and are deterministic -- they&#x27;re guaranteed to always return the same result when given the same inputs.  Results cannot depend on the order in which threads are scheduled.<p>tl;dr: don&#x27;t use IORefs and you should be fine",1424803634

- public transportation is not that good (especially in winter) and quite expensive relative to the avg. salary (about 80€ if you live in the AB zones, 100€ for ABC).
- high taxes, though this is a common problem in Germany.
- food is cheap, but not cheaper than in other German cities with better avg. salaries.

I put my ease of getting into programming down to..
1. I am just a natural. I&#x27;m very logical and think in terms of structure and organisation by nature.
2. I grew up with a C64 and then a series of pc&#x27;s, from a 286 running DOS onwards, in my home.<p>Though I <i>never</i> did any programming on them, I just played games on them. Though back then getting games working was all command-line and editing autoexec.bat and so on.

Architectural design is often about organising lots of competing elements into a structure or framework that makes sense.

When reading for academic purposes (including novels for say English majors), the pattern of reading is often non-linear. People may read through it once or more times, but the majority of the time is spent skipping around, constantly flipping back and forth trying to find the relevant passages for reference. Personally, this type of reading is a very visual experience for me, I remember where a certain equation or figure was on the page and can quickly flip to it even if I don&#x27;t remember the exact contents. Something that is not possible in the same way digitally.<p>On the other hand, I would guess that when most people read novels recreationally, they are reading in a linear fashion. There is a much smaller need for readers to constantly be flipping to different sections of the book while reading a novel.<p>There is also the issue of where people read. For textbooks, it is pretty easy to set a large book down on a table or desk at home, in a dorm room, or in a library. It is much harder to do so if you read primarily on a train or bus during rush hour or at a bus stop.",1424802115

That&#x27;s a hard argument to make. It seems to me that you&#x27;re arguing that the failure of others to share your consumption preferences means that there&#x27;s insufficient market pressure to on suppliers to deliver content in a way that suits you.<p>I like the idea of e-books but in practice I loathe reading them. That&#x27;s inconvenient, because we have a lot of books and I read fast, so moving house means dealing with several hundred pounds of printed matter and wrangling bookshelves. But the textural substrate of the physical book is far mroe appealing to me than any e-reader, not to mention being able to pencil notes on the margin or the creative pleasures of discovering epehemera of prior readers in used books, from personal ntoes to airline tickets. Likewise, DVD or blu-rays often deliver better viewing quality than streaming alternatives (although I use Netflix streaming regularly), and more importantly they often contain valuable extras - at least I find them valuable, because I work in film so things like interviews or director commentaries can have significant professional utility. Downside is having the wrangle the physical disks and annoying publisher lead-ins/piracy warnings and so on.<p>As for photos, I have thousands of digital ones as I shoot a lot, but ones I really like get printed and I also still shoot things on film because film grain color etc/ is so aesthetically pleasing. Film sets are generally digital these days, and that means shooting a bland, low-contrast image in order to maximize dynamic range and treat the footage with an appropriate &#x27;look&#x27; in post. Economically this makes a great deal of sense and I love the possibilities it opens up, but I also enjoy shooting blind on junk cameras (even a hand cranked one) to see what I&#x27;ll get. Digital is a great complement to working with or viewing physical media, but it need not and probably should not become a substitute. I have photos and artwork of mine hanging on the wall that I originated digitally, but I also enjoy brushes and paint; I do most of my writing at a keyboard but I carry notepaper and pencil everywhere because I <i>enjoy</i> writing things by hand, and because switching between different media is often a good way to escape creative blockages.",1424802072

Many books have been preserved for <i>generations</i>. People have trouble finding files from couple years ago.<p>- Format-agnostic. Remember about all the dead floppy drives and outdated formats, such as VHS and ZipDrive.)<p>- Great decoration, conversation starter and a kind of personal statement.<p>- As ridiculous as it may sound, I can visually &quot;scan&quot; a paper book faster than I can scan a file on the screen. This often is much more useful than search because I rarely remember the exact wording of things I need to find.<p>- Personally, I remember when and where I bought most of the physical books. Seeing them on a shelf serves as a great reminder. You are less likely to forget about physical book, than about a file. Before you proclaim this a silly point, take a look at your Steam/GOG &quot;library&quot;. Do you even remember what&#x27;s there? Do you remember how and when you bought it?

For example, dd-wrt/OpenWRT would become impossible, and even &quot;open source&quot; firmware would be basically meaningless since no one could use your changes.<p>One way around this might be to have the device accept two keys – a manufacturer key that is common to every device, and then a user key that is unique to the individual device and whose private key is provided to the user. This would add to cost and complexity, though.<p>Alternatively, provide some physical means (a jumper, e.g.) by which firmware verification can be temporarily disabled. The downside of this option is that you can&#x27;t do automated firmware upgrades any more, which makes it more likely you have vulnerable devices in the field for long periods of time.<p>There seems to be a fundamental tension between allowing users control and keeping them safe, which Alex Stamos recently termed &quot;security paternalism&quot;.

This means questions that go like:<p>If it was a conspiracy, it must have been carried out by some group. Who was that group?
What are the goals of that group?
Why did that group decide that the proposed plan was the best way to use their limited resources to achieve their goal, as opposed to some other plan?<p>I suppose the group here would be Putin and/or some group of Russian nationalists, and the goal would be to get the Ukrainian conflict out of the news.<p>Then the plan would involve a highly elaborate scheme of secretly designing sophisticated equipment, performing careful analysis, and smuggling highly-trained personnel onto a flight for the purpose of secretly diverting it to an obscure airfield. Then you&#x27;d have to execute all of the passengers who weren&#x27;t in on it and dispose of their bodies and the plane somewhere where they won&#x27;t be found for a long time, and make sure that none of the people who were in on it ever talk about it. And if you screw any of that up at any point, then you get the opposite of what your goal was - massive media attention of what a world-class asshole you are.<p>But if the goal is to disappear the flight for news coverage, why bother with all of that when 1% of the effort and even less risk would get it to crash somewhere in the Indian ocean, where it would likely never be found?<p>Why bother with any of it at all? Aren&#x27;t there lots of much simpler ways to distract the news media? Does anybody in Russia even care that much what the Western media thinks?<p>Another thing - what about China? As far as I know, the US and Europe are currently unhappy at Russian interference in the Ukraine, but China don&#x27;t seem to care much. There were a lot of Chinese nationals on that flight, though, and I bet China would be very unhappy indeed if it was ever discovered that they were killed by Russia in a ham-fisted attempt to distract the Western media. Possibly enough to lead to a change in the Chinese position on the conflict, including diplomatic, economic, and maybe military support for the Western position. Why would Russia take that risk, when there must be far simpler options out there?<p>I find that a lot of conspiracy theories fall apart under this type of analysis, without even paying much attention to the technical details.

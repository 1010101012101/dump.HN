I read a book (may have been a history of the Kokoda Trail) which discussed the Japanese soldiers reaction to being captured. The expectation was to be executed or tortured. Once it became clear this wasn&#x27;t going to happen, full cooperation usually occurred as the culture and loss signified the defeat by a superior leader and force, and allegiances shifted.

This method works, but only when there&#x27;s a huge pressure on the student to drill...something that the U.S. system just isn&#x27;t structurally built to supply in the ways that East Asian systems are.<p>My wife grew up in South Korea and came out of High School knowing the level of calculus I wouldn&#x27;t even touch until the last semester of my Sophomore year in College in a STEM program. Her 10th grade math textbook looked like an advanced version of my University Calculus course.<p>The problem I had, and the original question has is that there&#x27;s just no connection made for the student in the U.S. system from math class to <i>anything</i> remotely useful. Abstract statements like &quot;engineers need math&quot; just simply doesn&#x27;t mean anything to a bored out of their mind 7th grader. They have to actually use math to solve something they could solve with basic arithmetic and a calculator. Something with a reward at the end other than yet more notebooks full of drilled exercises: some flashing lights on a digital circuit, winning the pot at blackjack, launching a water balloon at a target, whatever.<p>But modern math education doesn&#x27;t just fail in making it boring, it makes math scary. Calculus becomes this &quot;special&quot; course only the tip-top AP students take...if your High School even offers it (those special students might even have to go take it at a local college). Basic calculus isn&#x27;t really all that hard to learn the mechanics of. It shouldn&#x27;t be treated as special. Just &quot;yet more rules for algebra&quot;. Even Math teachers would talk about trigonometry in hushed tones.<p>Modern Math education doesn&#x27;t even show student how to apply math to critical reasoning skills. Something even students who go on to the most liberal of liberal arts can benefit from.<p>Importantly, I don&#x27;t think anything I could have learned in K-12 mathematics remotely prepared me for the kinds of upper-level mathematics I eventually became exposed to at University. K-12 math prepared me to be a carpenter or a cashier, but it should have left me at a jump off point to be a scientist, or a philosopher, an engineer or a physicist, or at the very least given me a small glimpse into those worlds, because I sure as heck got a glimpse into 17th Century Japanese poetry styles, Shakespearean Theater, Classical Orchestra performance, being a member of Congress, and other career paths I wasn&#x27;t interested in pursuing.<p>I made some suggestions here <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5858652"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5858652</a>",1370910902

Accounting for that in public policy is keeping things in perspective.&quot;</i><p>My argument was very much not &quot;there are more deaths by X than terrorism, ergo we need to deal more with X&quot;.  However, I think most people are not at all aware of the staggering difference in the levels of risk they bear from various sources, and pointing out the radical differences helps to keep things in perspective.  A narrow counting of the dead is absolutely <i>not</i> the only correct perspective.  At the same time, telling people they need to worry more because other people will be worried is only making matters worse.  Better that they refuse to be terrorized (<a href=""http://www.schneier.com/essay-124.html);"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/essay-124.html);</a> that they recognize that by bearing in mind the actual relative threats they can <i>legitimately</i> feel safer.<p><i>&quot;Also, if you want to be hyper-rational about this: the NSA program probably has incredible bang-for-buck. If it costs $500 million a year, it only has to prevent a 9/11-scale event once or twice a century to justify itself.&quot;</i><p>That is not what rational means.<p><i>&quot;Also, if we&#x27;re &quot;keeping things in perspective&quot; why do you compare lives as if each one has equal value? One WTC worker was probably worth several times as much, in terms of GDP, as the average person who dies of heart disease. 3,000 people dying in Manhattan&#x27;s financial district == 15,000 people dying in a Kansas City tornado... Obviously I&#x27;m being glib with this line of argument. You can&#x27;t callously compare the two situations in the interest of &quot;keeping things in perspective.&quot; So to can you not compare people dying in a terrorist attack to people dying of heart disease.&quot;</i><p>There are so many things wrong with this.<p>First, you pick a metric that is most emphatically <i>not</i> just counting lives, find it ick, and conclude that you can&#x27;t just count lives.  Which isn&#x27;t really here nor there - my intent with number of lives was never to be precise but to give a sense of scale; adjust according to whatever perceived value you place on the respective lives.<p>More importantly, you&#x27;re making an emotional appeal that is frankly absurd: yes, comparing certain things can seem crass, but resources we&#x27;re spending on &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; aren&#x27;t being put to other use and liberties we&#x27;re giving up for &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; are enabling abuses (now or down the line), and we need to make comparisons if we&#x27;re going to make any decisions.

An enormous and dedicated user base? Users who expect high quality UX and are willing to pay for apps that provide it?<p>edit: Wait, I forgot a few: a very limited number of hardware platforms to target? The ability to target at most, two OS revisions and cover the vast majority of users?<p>It is, in many ways, an easier platform to build high quality software for. On top of that, the users there give a damn about the quality of the software (and not some ephemeral quality like &quot;openness&quot;).<p>> Develop for open systems instead. They will win in the end.<p>&quot;In the end&quot; is awfully open ended, and really there&#x27;s very little to demonstrate that open systems always win in the end. Exceedingly closed systems sometimes fail fast due to lack of adoption, but that doesn&#x27;t really hold in this case. Apple consistently releases hardware and software that, despite being closed, many users perceive as &quot;best-in-class&quot; (it does not matter whether you agree that they are -- the fact remains that <i>many</i> users believe that to be the case). Developers back that up by building best-in-class software for the closed platform because some of them also believe it to be best-in-class. As long as you&#x27;ve got that feedback cycle in place, I don&#x27;t believe a case can be made for openness even being a substantial factor in the shape of the market.",1370910209
5858652,comment,5854940,5854940,3,0,bane,,,"I was a very &quot;challenged&quot; math student in k-12. By 9th grade my experience had been so poor that it turned into a virtual phobia and I simply zoned out of the subject, scraping by with whatever remedial maths I could take until graduation. I was <i>torture</i>.<p>After High school I took a break for a few years before going to college for real. Once I had it in my mind to go to college, I signed up at my local community college and retook all of my high school maths. When I made it to Calculus I started signing up for other classes. I drilled, drilled, drilled the problems in every subject until my hands ached from writing. Slowly some patterns emerged and I started understanding more fundamental concepts about math, started to think symbolically. Working problems became an exercise in very careful symbol manipulation and not just arithmetic on steroids. It trained me in the kind of very careful mental discipline needed for a STEM degree.<p>I never really used much of the math I learned while studying Computer Science (outside of a couple small subjects), but that discipline, the intolerance for errors, and solving problems <i>did</i> have a huge impact. I also use very little of those maths in my day-to-day, but it&#x27;s definitely left me with a rigor I bring to the job.<p>It turns out that what I really enjoyed was logic and set theory that you just have to learn when you start out in CS. I <i>wish</i> that I had learned that first instead of arithmetic tables or pointless long division. I use logic and set theory all the time in critical thinking and daily reasoning...it&#x27;s so useful that it&#x27;s practically automatic and subconscious at this point.<p>I think the real problem, and the one the original question is pointing out is, math doesn&#x27;t mean <i>anything</i> to a youngster. There&#x27;s literally no application for it in their life beyond very simple addition and subtraction, skills usually learned by 3rd or 4th grade. After that it&#x27;s years and years of absolutely pointless busy work (to them). I also think Maths education should include more reading and math history.<p>Here&#x27;s an alternative k-12 maths education route that I think I would have taken to much more readily, since I could have started to apply it as a reasoning and critical thinking skill immediately:<p>- K, True and False, Counting numbers - reinforces concepts of True and False they&#x27;re already learning, teaches necessary basic numeracy (even Kindergarden aged kids get why counting is important)<p>- 1st and 2nd grade, T and F, AND, OR and NOT. More counting numbers, to 1000 and by 5s and 10s.<p>- 3rd grade, More complex boolean equations, basic boolean algebra, truth tables, implies -> operator. Negative numbers, count from -100,000 to 100,000 by 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 100s, 500s and 1000s.<p>- 4th grade, more complex boolean algebra, binary arithmetic (using +, -, * etc., it&#x27;s the same thing but with new symbols!) Simple, boolean word problems (teach rational reasoning! [1]), boolean laws (commutative, Associative, etc.). Basic Set Theory.<p>[1] - The moon is in the sky and the moon is made of cheese. Is this statemen true or false?<p>- 5th grade, More Set Theory, boolean equivalency (T /\ F = F == F /\ (T \/ F)), base 10 arithmetic, more boolean word problems, set theory word problems, critical thinking and reasoning. Read simple articles and determine if they are true or false. Basic prepositional calculus.<p>- 6th grade, various elements of digital circuit design (diagramming, equivalency, etc.), more base 10 arithmetic, more set theory, more binary math, half and full adder truth tables and diagrams, algebra<p>- 7th grade, more basic algebra, fractions, decimals, digital circuit labs (woah, application!, make a binary counter, and maybe a half and full adder) maybe Karnaugh maps, more critical reading, deeper set theory (Jaccard coefficients), base conversion<p>- 8th grade, geometry, functions, more complex circuits, non-binary logic and reasoning, basic statistics, maybe basic probability, logical fallacies,<p>- 9th grade, more geometry and functions, more complex probability and stats (non-calculus), deeper logic and reasoning topics, inductive and deductive arguments, basic proofs, etc., end of year logic project, intro to abstract mathematics, predicate logic<p>- 10th grade, basic calculus, basic trig, more proofs and techniques, complex inductive and deductive reasoning, complex set theory, end of year logic project, more abstract mathematics, simple physics equations and labs!<p>- 11th grade, more calculus, more Prob&Stats, vector algebra intro, mid-year and end of year logic project, more proofs, more abstract mathematics, physics equations and labs!<p>- 12th grade, discrete math, vector algebra & calc, imaginary numbers, abstract mathematics topics, etc. simple calculus physics and labs!<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that most children can learn the mechanics of basic calculus pretty simply. If you can do algebra, you can do basic calculus. You might not understand the immediate application, but physics and physics labs can be incredibly fun, calculate everything out and run an experiment.<p>I think logic should be taught before regular math because quite simply, the student isn&#x27;t getting hung up on all these <i>values</i> and can focus on learning what an operation is. Young children also are learning topics like &quot;truth and lies&quot; anyways and this helps reinforce this and will come more easily to them.<p>Digital circuit breadboarding is fun and gives a nice application for logic, it will engage tactile learners who tend to struggle with math subjects.<p>Reading and critical thinking discussions should be <i>central</i> in the curriculum. It reinforces the need to read, teaches rational thought and gives application to the logic. The scientific method is covered as an application of math in simple physics labs.<p>Also, by not focusing an entire year on a single subject (say a year on Geometry), the student can flex as some topics will come more naturally than others. So if they&#x27;re great at probability, but terrible at geometry, they&#x27;ll get the slack in the year to get up to speed on their geometry.<p>Side benefits, a better understanding of critical thinking skills and rational thought, the fact that there are different kinds of number systems, a good transition from math into physics (and science), hands on with computer stuff, they&#x27;ll be set up to understand things like bayes theory and proofs, it doesn&#x27;t treat relatively simple subjects as &quot;scary things only math priests do&quot; like calculus, word problems and logic go hand in hand, it eases them into word problems and base 10 math as a matter of course instead of as a &quot;special&quot; subject. Geometry just becomes another piece of the puzzle instead of a different course, leading nicely into calculus. Probability and stats open up lots of possibilities for practical labs and long term assignments and non-binary logical reasoning. etc. etc.<p>At every grade, there&#x27;s some way of spinning some of the subjects out into a practical, hands on lab...teach and reinforcing the <i>applicability</i> of math. Which of course is the entire problem all along. Reading assignments will bring along kids who are readers, I found math history unbelievably fascinating, you can go from ancient history to the computer age easily.<p>It shows future STEM jobs as part of the course work.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some topics and in real-life things might be shuffled around a bit, but I think I&#x27;m getting the basic gist across. There was no reason for me to struggle in school except that I could understand the application, and all of the adults around me seemed to get along fine with a calculator and basic arithmetic. But with this kind of curriculum, I would have been aware of a few dozen possible career paths in STEM (and elsewhere) that I never even conceived of. It would have kept me interested and focused.",1370910207

&quot;Remember Reflections on Trusting Trust, the classic paper describing how to hide a nearly undetectable backdoor inside the C compiler? Here&#x27;s an interesting piece about how to hide a nearly undetectable backdoor inside hardware. The post describes how to install a backdoor in the expansion ROM of a PCI card, which during the boot process patches the BIOS to patch grub to patch the kernel to give the controller remote root access. Because the backdoor is actually housed in the hardware, even if the victim reinstalls the operating system from a CD, they won&#x27;t clear out the backdoor. I wonder whether China, with its dominant position in the computer hardware assembly business, has already used this technique for espionage. This perhaps explains why the NSA has its own chip fabrication plant.&quot;",1370909647

The law the excerpt refers to is CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act), which was passed in the 1990s:<p>&quot;The law, as interpreted by the FBI, requires all companies providing telecommunications services in
the United States to install remote control ports on their routers which allow law enforcement, acting
autonomously and remotely (though theoretically only on a warrant) to easily extract any conversation in its entirety, up to 1% of the hubs total traffic simultaneously. This capability must have been
implemented by 1998, unless a waver until 10/24/2000 was granted.
Given a large installed base of equipment, there was a controversial element of cost involved. The FBI
played down the cost, asking congress to allocate $500 million. The FBI admits now that the cost
may be 4-8 times that high. Industry estimates the cost at $10 Billion.
Congress was convinced to allocate the original FBI estimate out of tax revenues, meaning the cost of
implementation is borne by taxpayers. The difference in implementation cost is borne by customers
of communication services.&quot;<p>Imagine how far things have come in the past 15 or so years.<p>To imagine that the US has anything less than the full capability to record and data-mine practically every electronically mediated communication is naive.",1370909037

Is this a bad thing? Many people will say that they should pitch it on its own merits. The thing is human communication is all about reducing an idea to concepts the listener already understands. I used to work on a startup that was an online freelancer marketplace based around social connections. I could also describe it as &quot;eLance meets Linkedin&quot;. The latter gets the idea across even though it&#x27;s not a <i>perfect</i> description. Doesn&#x27;t matter. If I&#x27;m dealing with someone who hears a lot of startup ideas, or has a low attention span (eg the typical investor), brevity trumps accuracy.<p>2. What about startups that use the &quot;X for Y&quot; template to <i>generate</i> business ideas? This might seem a bit more questionable. But if a certain model worked for one industry, why can&#x27;t it be adapted for another? Uber&#x27;s model of combining the best features of a marketplace and a high quality service firm worked well for taxis. Could it work for other markets? onefinestay is Uber meets AirBNB. Exec is  Uber meets TaskRabbit. You get the idea.

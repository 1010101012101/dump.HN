7691709,comment,7691354,7691354,1,0,travisb,,,"There&#x27;s a large number of dead projects in the distributed bug tracking field. There&#x27;s a few live ones as well. See <a href=""http://travisbrown.ca/blog.html#TooMuchAboutDistributedBugTracking2013-04-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travisbrown.ca/blog.html#TooMuchAboutDistributedBugTr...</a> for my summary of the situation.<p>I think distributed bug tracking hasn&#x27;t caught on in the same way distributed version control has because while distributed version control depends only on how individual programmers work, distributed bug tracking depends on the organization of the entire project.<p>If you look at companies which develop software there are obvious workflow advantages to a DVCS, but it&#x27;s still a centralized management structure which demands uniform visibility and control over the work the employees are doing. This is a case which argues against distributed bug tracking done in the same fashion as a DVCS, though just like a DVCS it can be used in a centralized manner which merely makes bug tracking faster for the developer.<p>If you look at open source projects many of them might have a bug tracker, but it&#x27;s mostly a place where user bugs go to die. Much more typical with herding the volunteers cats is that the mailing list is the prime place to try to win developers over to fix your bug. If you don&#x27;t succeed then you can try again later, but it might just be that the developers decided that your issue isn&#x27;t worth solving. In such organizations a bug tracker won&#x27;t get used anyway, so why bother figuring out distributed bug tracking?<p>Distributed bug tracking is a good fit with small projects because it reduces the necessary infrastructure. It can be made to work in other project types, but it&#x27;s less obviously a win there.",1399139804

7691704,comment,7690261,7690717,1,0,zo1,,,"Well, I guess that depends on our definition of environment. It&#x27;s clearly vague, and the lines are completely blurred.<p>So yes, I&#x27;d agree with you, there is no one that is currently interested in the stewardship of the &quot;environment&quot; except for principled individuals that believe it should be taken care of. There are plenty of examples where people own pieces of land, and they take very good care of it (and sometimes opposite). I grew up in a country where most low-mid and middle class individuals owned sizable plots of land. They spent quite a fair bit of time and money tending to their plots because it was theirs and represented value to them. Even more so for commercial versions of such ownership; particularly forestry enterprises.<p>This is the case that free-market individuals make for the environment. Which is a concept that a lot of state-centered individuals find flawed in free-market thinking. Precisely because the definitions of &quot;environment&quot; differ. To state-centered individuals, the &quot;environment&quot; is something non-concrete, over-arching and pretty much difficult to delineate from the rest of the land. The opposite of that is where someone considers land to be theirs, for their exclusive use, and will thus develop it and maintain is value. If that value is due to the scenery, then it will be preserved.",1399139713

7691702,comment,7689579,7690732,2,0,rsaarelm,,,"In this case the worst case would be very fast development of dangerous AI, and I&#x27;m not sure the 100 years is anywhere close to the lower bound. Low-end estimates for the computation power needed to run something equivalent to full human cognition are around 1 petaflop [1]. Google&#x27;s total computing power in 2012 was estimated at 40 petaflops [2]. Of course it&#x27;s split wide to a wide network of computers, but the human brain we&#x27;re looking for comparison looks like a pretty parallelizable design. So we seem to already be at point where it might just be the lack of very clever programming that keeps us from getting a weakly superhuman AI running in the Google internals.<p>It looks like we&#x27;ve got ways to go there though, current programs don&#x27;t seem to even begin to act anything like an adult human. So if the problem was to engineer an out of the box adult human level AI, we might again assume that there&#x27;s obviously decades of work left to do before anything interesting can be developed. The problem now is that that&#x27;s not how humans work. Humans start out as babies and learn their way up to adult cleverness. I can tell that an AI is nowhere near having an adult human intelligence out of the box, but I&#x27;m far less sure how to tell that an AI is nowhere near being able to start a learning process that makes it develop from something resembling a useless human baby towards something resembling an adult human in capabilities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+JamesPearn/posts/gTFgij36o6u"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+JamesPearn/posts/gTFgij36o6u</a>",1399139651

They had no choice but to rely entirely on Google’s vision and internal developers.</i><p>This is usually among the top criticisms of G+. I think it has a fair point. But a quick search says the first API announcement was on Step 15, 2011, about three months after G+&#x27;s initial launch. But the main problem could have been that the G+ API is not very powerful (disclaimer: I have never used the API), based on this: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/dont-expect-a-full-readwrite-google-api-anytime-soon-google-doesnt-want-to-disrupt-something-magical/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/dont-expect-a-full-readwrit...</a><p><i>But what Google actually built was a fancier Reddit</i><p>The word <i>fancier</i> is overrated. I rarely go to Reddit, but HN&#x27;s appearance is similar to Reddit&#x27;s. Simple layout fills with a table of rows of topics. G+ is like Facebook&#x27;s newsfeed in a photo gallery style which is actually ugly and unfriendly (the ordering is such an awkward thing to adopt to). Humans, well, at least I, don&#x27;t like G+&#x27;s feed layout.<p><i>Google hastily re-routed all its services through the Google+.</i><p>This is true. Most people have heard enough Youtube comedian and tumblr bloggers complaining about the whole G+ integration. I hate the fact that I would post Youtube comments to my public G+ when the two were first annexed.<p><i>That’s why I think the company should open source the code and seed it with cash and several developers. Give it the freedom that loyal power users deserve. It could become the next Mozilla (Firefox). And Google can still benefit from the data it generates.</i><p>I am not sure if he is serious about open sourcing G+ or G+ API or what? There is no way you can ever open source G+ because G+ is not a single software that you can <i>git/hg clone</i> down to your desktop and then start compiling like you can do with Firefox. G+ is not built with celery, ruby on rails. The stack is so complex. Unless he&#x27;s promoting Richard Stallman (RMS)&#x27;s idea that we should just have an open platform where ever can log into Google&#x27;s server and start hacking (anaology to his mention of someone logging into his computer and start checking out his mail directory). That would be nice if I can use the API to build &quot;Extensions&quot; and anyone who sees my page can actually make use of it.<p>Flexible layout is actually problematic for some people. Remember the days of Xanga, MySpace and today&#x27;s Tumblr? You can layout your entire page yourself, but because everyone has some insanely different like/taste of layout, some profiles have the most accessible layout (missing back-forth arrows, or font too small, etc). Facebook allowed some minimal customization in the past (changing the order of how your sidebar will look like to you and visitors).<p>My rants:<p>1. Simple, please<p>Google needs to make G+ simple. I don&#x27;t want a fancier look. I want a dead simple newsfeed. Facebook&#x27;s newsfeed is not very bad to be honest. It may have some spams and sponsored ads, but afterall, the feed is linear and easy to scroll and stop reading.<p>I always tell people that I hate using G+ because G+ settings are so complicated. Stop making things so complicated.<p>2. Don&#x27;t let strangers follow me!<p>Why would you even allow strangers to &quot;add me to their circle&quot; and start watching me when I don&#x27;t watch them to follow me? Most of these strangers are not even real people.<p>3. G+ notification is annoying and yet not working all the time<p>The notification is so buggy. I would miss invites and I won&#x27;t see the missing notifications. In fact, the integration with Gmail is so lame that if someone left me a message or I missed a hangout I will not receive any notification at all from Gmail&#x27;s interface. I would have to click on the &quot;Chats&quot; mail folder on Gmail to find out missed conversation.",1399139597

7691686,comment,7686039,7687524,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"My read is that the &quot;supply chains&quot; arguments are largely incorrect.  The scale of operations of the 100kgal/day site would vastly exceed the available onboard space available within any existing warship -- you&#x27;d need a floating platform of some sort dedicated to the task.  Since the proposal presumes use of a carrier&#x27;s own nuclear plant to supply power for the operation, the carrier would be physically tethered to the fuel synthesis platform.<p>Carrier operations require operating at near flank (top) speed for takeoffs and landings.  You couldn&#x27;t fight and fuel at the same time.  Even task-switching between modes would be at best cumbersome.<p>The US NRL&#x27;s own research materials propose a fixed-site pilot, perhaps powered by OTEC (ocean thermal energy conversion) as a renewable energy source (this provides constant 24/7 power based on sea temperature gradients from sites such as the Hawaiian Islands with proximate shallow and deep-water zones at large temperature differential).  Similarly <i>any</i> electrical power source, most conceivably renewable solar or wind, or nuclear, could be used for fuel synthesis.  My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that supplying the equivalent of present-day US petroleum consumption would be plausible.  It would require a few thousand km^2 of solar capacity, a roughly 10m tall by 4.5m square processing plant, and capital of roughly $8 trillion (based on USNRL&#x27;s estimates) for synthesis and likely 1-2x that for the solar capacity.<p>In either case, you&#x27;d still have tankers and tenders transporting fuel, what you&#x27;d eliminate is the specific reliance on routes from existing petroleum extraction and refining sites.<p>Overall efficiency should be <i>vastly</i> better than the levels discussed here.  Limiting point seems to be hydrogen electrolysis, which is 60% efficient (in terms of hydrogen energy potential) based on existing operational data.  The Fischer-Tropsch reaction is pretty low in energy demand, or net positive.  There are _vast_ volumes of seawater which would have to be processed, and pumping of that could be a significant energy cost (or perhaps tidal flows and some clever one-way-flow solid-state valves could be used to accomplish this:  <a href=""http://makezine.com/2012/01/05/the-tesla-valve-one-way-flow-with-no-moving-parts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://makezine.com/2012/01/05/the-tesla-valve-one-way-flow-...</a>).<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me what the <i>actual</i> efficiency of the USNRL&#x27;s method would be, though it seems clear that 60% net energy recovery is a theoretical maximum.

But if there is only a 1 or 2 meter head, it takes a huge water current to make more than a few MW.<p>I’ve also seen these snake-like creations that are big floating drums with hydraulics between them, that bend with the waves.  So the head is about the same, but the period is a few seconds instead of a day, so a lower current is needed.  However, the amount of current they capture is so small compared to a dam that they only generate on the order of a few kW.<p>The idea of using a large float is certainly compelling.  Off the top of my head, maybe it could work similarly to having a bag at the bottom of the ocean with a pipe connected to an artificial floating island on the surface.  It would pull on the bag as the tide rises to inhale air into the bag, and then let it exhale as the tide falls.  A turbine in the tube would generate electricity in both directions.  Water weighs 1000 kg per cubic meter (62.5 pounds per cubic foot), so if we use the dam formula for 1 cubic meter and +/- 1 meter of tide, the float would travel 1 m up, 1 m back down, then 1 m down and 1 m back up, for a total distance of 4 meters every 24 hours.  So I think we can use the dam formula:<p>power P = phrgk<p>density p = 1000<p>height h = 4<p>flow rate = volume/time = r = 1/(60 * 60 * 24) = 1.16e-5<p>gravity g = 9.8<p>efficiency k = .6<p>so:<p>P = 1000 * 4 * 1.16e-5 * 9.8 * .6 = 0.27 W/m3<p>As a sanity check, the amount of energy required to raise 1000 kg of water 4 meters is:<p>E = mgh = 1000 * 9.8 * 4 = 39200 J<p>So power is energy over time, so:<p>P = E/t = 39200/(60 * 60 * 24) = 0.45 W/m3<p>So at 60% efficiency, power = 0.27 W/m3<p>This is one of the reasons why the head is so important, because it takes remarkably little energy to raise a ton of water, literally.<p>So if we want a 1 MW plant, we’d need a float about 3.7 million cubic meters, which would be a sphere with a radius of about 100 meters by V = (4 * pi * r^3)/3, or about 600 feet across.  It would also need a bag of similar volume anchored to the bottom of the ocean.<p>Since the pressure is reversed for the bottom balloon, it would take on the shape of a tetrahedron, so would need strong anchors holding 3 corners to the ocean floor, with one of the corners connected to the float by a tube.  The 3 edges touching the floor would need to be sealed against water leaking in.  A bit of an engineering feat..<p>To make it worth our while, we’d probably want a float 1000 times bigger, or 6000 feet across to generate 1 GW.  I have a little trouble picturing a mile wide float, its surface area would be:<p>Area = 4 * pi * r^2 = 4 * pi * 1000^2 = 12.6 million square meters<p>Although this doesn’t seem that bad, even at a cost of $10 per square meter.<p>Now that I write this, maybe a better alternative to the bottom bag would be a steel cable connected by a pulley to the ocean floor, that comes up on land and moves a meter or two forward and back each day.  It could either be connected to a hydraulic system with a thin (high flow rate) tube, or perhaps a high gear reduction transmission that converts the motion to say, 60 Hz or something.<p>Unfortunately we’re talking 4 trillion kg of tension (4 billion m3 * 1000 kg per m) for a 1 GW plant, and a steel cable to carry that tension is infeasible, at 7500 kg per square cm (75 million kg per square m) of cross sectional area, which I calculated from the 11.5 mm cable which works out to a 1 cm2 cross section at 16540 lb (7500 kg):<p><a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-rope-strength-d_1518.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-rope-strength-d_1518....</a><p>So when it’s all said and done, it’s possible to build the float but I don’t know how the power could be extracted practically.",1399139395

If thats your standard for success, then every path likely leads to failure because no path reliably leads to that kind of success. Some paths are more likely than others, but none are very likely for the <i>average</i> person.<p>Part of the reason for flat-ish career trajectory is that programmers earn more at the start than most. Some professions have more of a premium on seniority and experience than others. Senior doctors and lawyers for a combination of the above 2 reasons probably have steeper salary growth than programmers. That said, good 10+ yrs programmers do earn pretty damn well. 10 years as a doctor or lawyer and you&#x27;re still considered a youngin.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re the CEO, you aren&#x27;t a programmer.

7691622,comment,7691332,7691332,9,0,jw2013,,,"No offense to the author, but what a terribly written article full of logic holes. For example:<p>&#x27;Our parent company&#x27;s former CEO started off as a programmer 25 years ago, switched to manager; in 15 years he went all the way to being CEO of a $4B company. After 10 years he retired recently with mansions and cars and no worries. Meanwhile I work with people who started around the same time and who are still senior software engineers.&#x27;<p>So the author just picks one person that happens to be the CEO evetually? What about the rest majority of managerial forks? They probably are stuck in corporate ladder and even may be fired already. The chance of a person working on a corporate managerial job evetually becomes a CEO is likely no higher than a tech person eventually becomes a CTO. So why just pick one CEO person to illustrate managerial role is more promosing than tech role? Comparing the max value of a group to the average of another group is unfair.<p>Also, I program because I love programming. Even if you gave me one billion dollar making me manage people for the rest of my life instead of writing code, I would still turn it down.  If doing the thing I love is dead end, then I beg a different definition of dead end. Okay, just use author&#x27;s definition of dead end as slight chance of moving up, but I just don&#x27;t care as long as I love the job I am doing.<p>__<p>An interesting side note is programming as a hobby. But I would still rather programming both at work and a spare time, as long as the day job I do making me happy.",1399138675

Some are simple terminology changes, like using &quot;fork&quot; instead of &quot;clone&quot;. Some are more intrusive, like tying the pull request mechanism to the GitHub review tool.<p>Secondly, GitHub terms only let you have one unpaid account. If I want to maintain some personal repos, but also some with one of my professional hats on, it costs me money. If I want to keep my work on a major project separate to a few sidelines, it costs me money.<p>Thirdly, GitHub is an on-line service, and like anything else in the cloud, that means it comes with unknown security, privacy and reliability implications. For a big open source project, that might or might not be a problem, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would expect me to host my own projects there instead of, I don&#x27;t know, in a Git repository on a server at home or at work, or something crazy like that.<p>So no, sorry, I won&#x27;t fork you on GitHub. Nor will I contribute a patch via a pull request. Nor will I raise my helpful bug report on your project if you require me to submit it via GitHub. And I guess I&#x27;m lucky that I don&#x27;t apply for jobs as an employee any more, because I am able to show approximately none of the best professional quality code I write without violating confidentiality agreements, and certainly none of it is in a GitHub repo for public inspection.<p>I am happy to support open source projects when I have a bit of time free, and I&#x27;m happy to demonstrate my credentials and abilities to prospective clients, but GitHub is a hoop that is rarely worth jumping through IME.",1399138415

Please find my comments below:<p>Point 1:<p>For your example of quitting school, you are making the assumption that the tech industry has the same welcoming environment as academia for women. I can tell you that is wrong.<p>The same argument can be applied to your second example. At most jobs (not startups) there are harassment policies in place so I know who to complain to if my manager makes a move on me. At hackathons, these policies are not always in place. At the time, I didn&#x27;t know I could complain against that man. I also wrote this blog post for my friends and they know the whole story. I apologize for not writing it, I will go back and edit my post. The man that made that comment is an angel investor in Boston and NYC. He has invested in some of my friends&#x27; startups. I was mortified that he treated me in that way and I was afraid that if I said anything I would be ostracized and have my career ruined if I said anything. My friends showed me this wasn&#x27;t true.<p>Point 2:<p>Most women don&#x27;t know they can have that as a career option. There are women who are working towards this vision, and we need help from experienced men to help us succeed.<p>I disagree with Paul Graham&#x27;s statement. There is no official language in the U.S. and French is actually the language of business. English is not my first language, and though I do not have an accent, I am perceived to have one because I pronounce my name the correct way. We need to stop putting our own perceptions on each other and work together to make an industry that works for all.<p>I am not whining, I am talking about my experiences and this is the only way for us to learn about each other. Silencing those of us who are unhappy is not the answer. Give us the space to contribute just as much as our white and/or male counterparts have.<p>On Safety<p>At a club I can say something and that man is taken away by security. That is not always the case in the tech industry and that needs to change so we feel safe. I do not attend conferences for the entertainment of the men around me. I&#x27;m here to learn just like they are. I&#x27;m sure you get hit on by men, but are you afraid to say no because they may rape you and that is worse than just being okay with it? Do people call you a bitch or a tease when you say no? Though I could be wrong, I doubt that you have the same fears I do in the same situations.<p>Point 3<p>This is how we get inspired and this is how we fight. It has taken me almost 2.5 years to have the courage to speak about my experiences. I do realize now that my post could be seen as very negative towards men and I apologize for that. I&#x27;m going to work on a more positive post soon :)",1399138001

Haskell is great for not only what features the language has but also what features the language does not have. It&#x27;s practically impossible to shoot yourself in the foot with it.<p>Assuming widespread adoption was a goal, I think Haskell could stand to learn from the Rust community. They could force you to explicitly declare when you want to write unsafe code. Rust does something like this with pointers. You need to go out of your way to use an unsafe pointer, but you can do so in the name of expediency.<p>I would love it if more language chose to gently coerce me into writing better code than one that doesn&#x27;t allow me to write bad code.

One person I knew made it to that level (after some 20-30 years experience) and still programmed every day.<p>Edit: that said, I don&#x27;t consider it a dead end job if you have to switch out of programming to keep advancing because often to become an engineering manager at companies they want you to have programming experience.

7691508,comment,7690897,7691319,2,0,jervisfm,,,"> b) how to disrupt github?<p>There are certainly areas that github could use some improvement. One of the basic features that I see as currently missing is actual side-by-side Diffs like those available in Chromium Code Reviews[1]. This makes it so much easier to review code changes and thus improves the experience of collaboratively working on a project. The Github folks are smart people, so I&#x27;m sure they know this and yet years after launch this is still not available in Github while they continue adding things like improved map diffs [2] which while nice features on their own, it only serves to show that a good code diff experience is not as important to them now.<p>Secondly, I find Github search to be lacking in terms of fulfilling its potential. It seems we all agree that Github is the number one place most people put their public code on. This is great, we have one central public repository. And yet searching for, finding and discovering good code on Github is not as easy as it should be. I argue that it should be easy to find solutions to programming problems that others have already tackled. Imagine being able to type &quot;compute sha256, c++&quot; and seeing relevant code snippets right there.  I am not saying this is an easy problem to solve, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worthwhile one to try. Who knows, may be someone will build an awesome code search engine on top of github.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://codereview.chromium.org/261573002/diff/60001/google_apis/gcm/engine/checkin_request.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codereview.chromium.org/261573002/diff/60001/google_...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps</a>",1399137156

Assuming that you don&#x27;t want to use simply a translation table, and you really need different code for each element from the enum, you would first create an interface:<p>public interface ILanguage {<p>String convert(int num);<p>}<p>Then you would subclass for each language:<p>public class SpanishLanguage implements ILanguage {<p><pre><code>  public String convert(int num) {\n\n    String ret;\n\n    switch (num) {\n\n      case 0: ret=&quot;cero&quot;;break;\n\n      case 1: ret=&quot;uno&quot;;break;\n\n      default: ret=&quot;~~~&quot;;\n\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n\n  }\n</code></pre>\n}<p>And the same for English, German or whatever you want. Yes, it gets too verbose, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;d prefer just a translation table... in any case, you can abstract common code for languages that only implement translation for 1, 2 and others, and create more complex subclasses for different behaviours. But I digress...<p>Now that you have the interface, you would declare the enum as follows:<p>public enum Language {<p><pre><code>  SPANISH(new SpanishLanguage()), ENGLISH(new EnglishLanguage()), GERMAN(new GermanLanguage());\n\n  // This is a member instance.\n\n  private ILanguage translationImpl;\n\n  // And this is the one and only constructor.\n\n  public Language(ILanguage translationImpl) {\n\n    this.translationImpl=translationImpl;\n\n  }\n\n  public String convert(int number) {\n\n    return translationImpl.convert(number);\n\n  }\n</code></pre>\n}<p>If you do this, you <i>need</i> to supply the implementation of the language to the constructor, otherwise your code fails to compile. So you can&#x27;t add FRENCH or JAPANESE after GERMAN(new GermanLanguage()); you need FRENCH(new FrenchLanguage()), JAPANESE(new JapaneseLanguage()) and so on.

It was ~$1k, but for several reasons I thought it was a good buy. The cashier made a big deal about it when I went through the checkout line, laughing loudly at my stupidity for purchasing such an expensive model and actually exhorting the cashier in the next lane to do the same. Didn&#x27;t I know that I could have got a washing machine for $300 or less? I was really embarrassed; I&#x27;ve never bought another appliance in-store.<p>I&#x27;m still using the washing machine.

Typically 700 microns there have been examples of working wafers as thin as 5 microns. If you stack 5 micron silicon you can put 100 chips in the same place you put 1 before, assuming you can figure out how to talk between them. Thru-silicon-vias (TSV) is the current poster child but there are better alternatives coming. Should be interesting when that comes to market.",1399136485

The more iops, the less space and the less cost.  I&#x27;d say Netflix is always optimizing for both.<p>The right question to ask is what is the break-even point between space and cost where these drives make sense, and that would depend mostly on how popular the most popular content is.  If everyone were watching the same few things, but enough that it can&#x27;t just all fit in RAM, it would make a lot of sense to have a lot of these drives.

For good drives, x is 1.  For really good SLC NAND based drives x could be as much as 10, but they are very expensive.  For cheap consumer drives x could be 1/10.  Based on vendor sales meetings, the aggressively large drives also have low write endurance (but then they say they are not optimized for heavy writes).<p>Better drives should have a built-in write counter so you can track the remaining life.<p>Another interesting parameter is their power-off &quot;data retention&quot; time.

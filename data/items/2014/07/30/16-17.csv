8109415,comment,8109083,8109083,1,0,courtf,,,"A billion dollars for a one engineer social media company? Certainly possible, but then you&#x27;d have to ask yourself what you are paying for. Perhaps it&#x27;s not just (or even mostly) the engineering; in which case I&#x27;d say the author slightly misses the mark here.<p>This is certainly not to say that I believe more engineers/engineering == better product or more value, far from it.  Only that devaluation of skill and experience suggests that the problem being addressed might not be primarily focused on engineering tasks. And that perhaps the gargantuan sums we see being paid for some small collection of companies are calculated somewhat differently than we might be used to.<p>Even if I&#x27;m wrong about that, heralding the death of the highly skilled engineer is more than a little premature either way.  I tend to think that problems will continue to present themselves to challenge our best tools, regardless of how much engineer quality of life improves.  If that&#x27;s not happening in social media (which I highly, highly doubt), then that can probably be considered a separate issue entirely.",1406739572
8109414,comment,8109083,8109083,6,0,sergiosgc,,,"The article makes the error of assuming that a 10x engineer is 10x because he has arcane knowledge about the intricacies of low level programming. This may be true for some layers of development. In my experience, for application programming, this isn&#x27;t the &quot;10x skill&quot;.<p>10x engineers are the guys that can grasp the complexities of large systems, enabling them to change them with minimal effort. When prompted with the need to implement a new use case, they understand the whole system or most of the system and thus they can plot the minimal change path to achieve the new functionality. They don&#x27;t code faster. They code less, leveraging work that is already done.<p>If you have fewer engineers working on a system, because of better abstraction layers, then you only need the 10x guys. These are the ones that can drive the powerful machines.<p>What we are witnessing isn&#x27;t the demise of the 10x engineer. It&#x27;s the demise of the code monkey.",1406739567

This is very silly reasoning and it ignores history.<p>Transported back in time, he could say the same thing watching the small, passionate computer shops of the 1970s becoming huge organizations as customer money and investment capital flow in, as more engineers are hired, as efficiencies and industry-wide standardization set in. He could say that the emergence of low-skill labor in the mature industry was the end of engineering, that there was nothing more to do.<p>But there will always be a new layer to this game. Once the previous layer has walked its arc from hobbyist to small shops to huge industries and maturity, there emerges a ragtag group that takes advantage of the new environment.<p>Gerstenzang does identify and appreciate this crucial factor, he just seems to view it as an endpoint and not a beginning.<p>Of course, an AI that can do real, human-level engineering might throw my own entire line of reasoning out of the window.",1406739561

It allowed you to download Snaps and send pictures from your Gallery, pretty much the only features people would want to add to Snapchat.<p>Powered it with an IAP to add &#x27;My Story&#x27; support and small banner ads at the bottom of the screen.  The app got about 2,500-3,500 downloads a day up to a total of 165,000 downloads.  When searching for &#x27;Snapchat&#x27; on Google play it was the 2nd or 3rd result.  IAP brought in about $25 a day (after 30% removed) and the ads peaked at about $70 a day, so total was between $90 and $100 a day when things were good.<p>Didn&#x27;t last long though, took a while to get to that daily amount and Google/Snapchat removed it from the store after the 3rd month of availability.

Software development is now more accessible to more people because of all these frameworks and tools.

8109394,comment,8109002,8109266,7,0,_delirium,,,"They also are legally required to collect donor information for donations above $1,000 [1]. Mostly this is to ensure that nonprofits aren&#x27;t playing weird games with funneling money around, e.g. being registered as a 501(c)(3) charity but actually being funded mainly by one person who also controls the board/spending.<p>Maybe they can rework the donation flow so it allows anonymous donations below that limit? But if that has the effect of making large donations seem different/weird/complicated, it might be counterproductive: you have to get a <i>lot</i> of extra $5 donations to make up for a single lost $10,000 donation. I&#x27;m no UI/flow expert though so maybe there&#x27;s a good way of doing it. There are basically three cases that would need to be worked in: 1) above $1,000, information is mandatory; 2) between $250 and $1,000, information is not mandatory but must be entered if the donor is American and wants a receipt that would enable them to deduct it; 3) below $250, receipts aren&#x27;t necessary for tax deduction so donor information isn&#x27;t needed at all.<p>[1] More precisely, they&#x27;re required to report all donors who gave more than $5,000 cumulatively in a given year (or possibly a higher threshold for very large organizations), which requires keeping a running sum of per-donor totals. Except that as a concession to ease of recordkeeping, individual donations below $1,000 do not need to be included in the total, and therefore I believe (?) could be accepted anonymously. Or so I read the IRS&#x27;s guidelines, but IANACPA; see Form 990 Schedule B or your local accountant specializing in nonprofit law for details.",1406739410

And there would be a marketplace of components built by more experienced developers.<p>So 5 years ago I started my first open source platform, <a href=""http://phponpie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phponpie.com</a><p>Since then it&#x27;s come a long way, and it turned into a real platform: <a href=""http://platform.qbix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.qbix.com</a><p>Like mobile apps, social apps require an operating system that solves common problems in a standard way:<p><pre><code>  * User signup and secure auth, login\n  * Should work with emails, mobile #, facebook\n  * Accessible from desktop, tablets, mobile\n  * Contacts integration / friendlists\n  * Real time collaboration from any device\n  * Offline notifications via fb, sms, app notifications etc.\n  * Access control and privacy - as expressive as possible\n  * Native apps on iPhone and iOS via Cordova\n  * Invitations and one-click account creation\n  * Encourage best practices for scaling, web standards etc.\n  * Installer to upgrade apps and plugin versions cleanly\n</code></pre>\netc etc.<p>All that stuff should have standard solutions which you can override. The apps and plugins should all interoperate.<p>And finally, since I really care about decentralization, it would be cool if this whole operating system could be as decentralized as Wordpress is for blogs, as opposed to say facebook. That would also solve all the scaling problems that facebook and other centralized social networks have.<p>That last part - decentralizing the social network - took the most effort, as I had to solve problems of security, identity, privacy, as well as app and plugin versioning and signing across a distributed network. Just like iOS is for mobile apps, and Bitcoin is for distributed contract apps, the Q Platform is if you want a social layer for your app, from user accounts to everything else, without having to write it from scratch.<p>Yeah, so that&#x27;s what I built.

All the examples are just different ways of making an HTTP request, whether through the curl command or a full-blown language.  Hitting this API has only one requirement: something capable of making HTTP requests.<p>Running the script directly requires a correctly-configured environment for each scripting language you want to support on each device.  If a script has additional dependencies or libraries, those must also be installed locally if you want to run the script locally.  By putting the script behind an HTTP API, it just needs to be correctly configured once on a single device (the API server), and then the requirement for using the script on all other devices is just plain old HTTP.<p>Suppose you have five different scripts each written in a different language (because languages have their own strengths and weaknesses).  And suppose you need to run all of these scripts on three completely different devices (say, a phone, a laptop, and an Arduino).  If you want to run the scripts directly on each device, then you need to set up 5*3=15 runtime environments and make sure they all function correctly (and don&#x27;t break with updates).  To save effort, it might make sense to put these scripts behind an HTTP API, and then just use simple HTTP requests from each device to access all scripts in a uniform manner.  Note that in reality, you&#x27;ll probably want to be targeting much more than three devices, so the savings can stack up quickly.",1406736891

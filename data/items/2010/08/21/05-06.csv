DuckDuckGo?<p>If google published the definitive spec of their algorithm (i.e. source code to their search engine), would you read hundreds of thousands lines of code? Would you be able to comprehend it? Would you re-read it every week to make sure that hundreds of commits made by google engineers didn't change it in a way you don't like?<p>It's preposterous to think that you could comprehend their algorithm in a way that allows you to make an informed decision about whether to use or not. Let's assume you understand it and don't like how it works, what you gonna do? Use Bing?<p>You don't need reassurance that Google's algorithm is aligned with your interests. It isn't. Neither is Bing's algorithm or anyone else's. BMW doesn't make cars that are aligned with your interests. Apple doesn't make phones that are aligned with your interests. They all make products that are aligned with their interest to make money, they put them in the market and you decided with your money whether you think they serve you or not. That system works pretty well.<p>You have a choice to use any web search engine you like. You can decide whether you like their results or not by making queries and inspecting the results. You are free to create a competing search engine. Those are your rights.<p>You don't have a right to require google to disclose how their products work. There's a name for it: trade secret. It's protected by law and it's google's right to keep it to themselves.",1282370360

1622333,comment,1621965,1622063,0,0,korch,,,"A possible contributing factor just popped into my head, and only applies to a small subset of the tech industry. I know from experience that big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and undoubtedly many others, all have significant numbers of workers who are non-exempt contractors(i.e. not direct employees). I don't know how much labor laws vary from state to state, but in WA they are legally bared from employing these special contractors for longer than 11 months. After 11 months they have to convert them to direct employees. So in order to shirk the law and evade paying equal benefits, salaries, options, and corporate taxes, these companies dismiss those contractors for 30 days, then re-hire them. At least in Washington state, this is a standard practice for the past decade or so. There are many loop holes and exceptions, so I'm not even sure of the extent to which this contractor law is applicable.<p>At Microsoft or Amazon, at least a few years ago when I saw the HR numbers, at any given time, ~20% of the total pool of workers can be temp contractors, so that is a sizable numbers of workers coming and going each December, at least on paper, even if those workers stay on as contractors for many years. (As an aside, I've always wondered why this doesn't generate the same amount of bad PR as the entire video game industry, especially the ""EA slave-ship"").<p>I don't have nearly as much direct experience outside of the software industry, but I imagine other industries are doing likewise and on a far broader scale.<p>Extending this employment pattern to the whole economy, it might explain a big percentage of these mysterious to pin-down ""seasonal workers."" Or perhaps the labor statistics are just being fudged across the board(thanks US BLS!), from the top down, to try to keep a lid on the worsening unemployment and underemployment situation. I suspect it's a lot of both.<p>Since the 70's America has been hemorrhaging ""real jobs""—i.e. non-service-sector jobs that actually pay an inflation adjusted living wage. Those of us fortunate enough to win the career lottery by going into tech have been quite shielded from the backdrop of the economic decline, and the mass exporting of (manufacturing mostly?) jobs to overseas.",1282368917

You should be talking to them anyways to get their feedback on the idea behind your product.<p>If you must use beta users as a metric, be very conservative and realize that most of those signed up will probably not even use the beta, let alone buy the product (this varies by industry and product of course, among many other factors). In your case, you might think 1 in 100 signups will become customers, or 1 in 1000, or 1 in 10.

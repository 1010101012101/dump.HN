Its all about context.<p>It &quot;works&quot;, but I&#x27;ve never found those adverts convincing. People don&#x27;t eat at a restaurant every day, and the food from a restaurant will be better than whatever M&S is offering.<p>It&#x27;s best not to try and trick your customers into spending more money for an inferior product. It tends to backfire over the long term.",1404827975

8004514,comment,8004092,8004092,5,0,wavegeek,,,"I suspect this may be derived from the book &quot;Daily Rituals&quot; which analysed a number of eminent people. I did an analysis from the book and my conclusions were:<p>I divided the people in the book &quot;Daily Rituals&quot; into eminent and not-so-eminent based on whether I could recall much about what they did.<p>I found that eminent people almost all had a strong daily routine. Eg Hemingway would start writing at 6:30am regardless of how hung-over he was (possibly the reason for his view that &quot;all first drafts are rubbish&quot;). <p>Also they were very inclined to let nothing get in the way of their work. See below for some examples.<p>Quite a few took stimulants including tea coffee nicotine and even amphetamines in several cases. Eminent people were also more likely to take regular walks. Both the eminent and less eminent people had a pretty strong tendency to get working in the morning. The eminent people were  also more likely to have regular systematic social relaxation activities.<p>Proust took caffeine tablets and then took strong sleeping tablets to get to sleep. Perhaps he could have saved himself some money and put himself to sleep by reading his books.<p>I only had 13 non-eminent people as I got bored reading about people I had not heard of so the results for them are probably rather rubbery.<p>At the end I have extracts of the agreement of Einstein with his wife, and a report of Richard Feynman&#x27;s (Nobel physicist) divorce case as illustrations of &quot;hard core&quot; commitment/obsession to their work.<p>Einstein Agreement with wife (relevant extracts)<p>A.

His ex-wife reportedly testified that on several occasions when she unwittingly disturbed either his calculus or his drums he flew into a violent rage, during which time he attacked her, threw pieces of bric-a-brac about and smashed the furniture.",1404827874

A lot of people use marketing and promotion interchangeably. Promotion is just a part of your marketing strategy.<p>Marketing is the science of bring a product to market. A good marketing plan includes (among other things) initial market research, analysis of the marketplace (the dynamic relationship between companies, products, segments, distribution channels and consumers), finding a product-market fit (defining product design and specifications based on the market analysis and your short,mid and long-term goals), pricing strategy, and finally - promotion strategy.<p>There are some great (and free) MOOCs on marketing strategy on coursera. I recommend &quot;Competitive strategy&quot; and &quot;Advanaced competitive strategy&quot; by Tobias Kretschmer, if you are not looking to change the world with this great new app you and your friend are hacking together. Checking out &quot;Introduction to marketing&quot; is good if you want a checklist for consumer-driven philosophy. A rule of thumb when taking MOOCs is to use the videos simply as general pointers.

Switching from one piece of software to another has a fixed cost, but switching to software that makes you more productive will help offset that cost.<p>I agree on OO. The risk in my eyes here is that OSS (desktop) software is almost invariably less productive than proprietary software for some reason. Switching that way can make sense if you save a lot on licenses, administration etc., but if you have to pay once for a switch AND then pay continuously by using less productive software you are taking a much higher risk. It may give a warm fluffy feeling to be using open standards, but the problem is that the only standard that exists is a de-facto proprietary standard set by Microsoft. It may be noble to try to change that, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to spend tax money being the first major city to do so.",1404827531

Anywho, aside from that I can tell you that the vast majority of bugs I introduce into my Python code (or other languages) are caught by GHC - these are bugs that purely have to do with my inability to remember what something is or is doing, or fear of refactoring something, or some tangled mess of types that are harder to reason about in Python because they&#x27;re in my head instead of encoded in Haskell.<p>I&#x27;ve discovered that <i>when I&#x27;ve been able to compile</i> my Haskell programs the bugs I find in them are usually business logic bugs now. Occasionally I&#x27;ll make use of QuickCheck / HUnit for automated property testing and unit testing, and that will help catch those business logic bugs.<p>Very subjective and anecdotal but I can promise you that the experience is very real.<p><i>> In isolation, that&#x27;s a bit hand wavy IMO.</i><p>Sure, but if you take into account Haskell&#x27;s denotational semantics vs. other language&#x27;s <i>operational semantics</i> it should be pretty clear that Haskell inherits Mathematic&#x27;s idiom for succinct expression. That idiom also informed the language designers when building Haskell&#x27;s grammar and syntax, it&#x27;s very flexible and abstract - both in the essence of the language (it&#x27;s semantics) and its modality.<p>When reading idiomatic Haskell, there&#x27;s a lot of information packed into a line, conceptually and syntactically.<p><i>> This is something I hear quite often from the Haskell community...</i><p>Sure, it probably borders on it, but in many ways other language communities commit the bandwagon fallacy (Go is one) - so I think you can poke holes all over the place. The fact though that proof proving systems and dependently typed languages like Agda and Idris (which are the future and I think will supplant Haskell unless Haskell can evolve) are being written in Haskell which speaks to the level of intellect and forward thinking in the community.",1404826797

8004349,comment,8002188,8002370,12,0,GreaterFool,,,"Another Haskeller here. I strongly recommend you take a second look at OCaml. I think it has some fantastic features that Haskell doesn&#x27;t:<p>Modules. They are great for solving major code organisation problems and I really hope Haskell will get a module system soon (&quot;Backpack&quot; paper). Type classes are great for things like Monad and Num since you are likely to use many different Monads or Nums in the same chunk of code. But consider what happens if you want to support both ByteString and Text in your library (let&#x27;s say a parser library). You may end up with a type class constraint like ListLike and your code will be littered with &#x27;ListLike .. =>&#x27;. But when you&#x27;re parsing some data later on it will be either ByteString or Text. So I&#x27;d fix my choice of ListLike at module instantiation time and make the constraint go away. If I need both (e.g. I&#x27;m reading some data from a socket and some of it is Text and some of it is ByteString) then I&#x27;m just going to instantiate two modules, one for each. To me this is a much cleaner solution.<p>Named/optional function parameters. They solve a bunch of minor but incredibly annoying problems. A simple example: <i>for</i> (aka <i>flip map</i>); It is not in Prelude and whenever it comes up there are plenty of people who are opposed for one reason or another. In OCaml (Core library) it doesn&#x27;t matter because map takes the function by named parameter so <i>List.map ~f:(fun x -> x + 1) [1;2;3]</i> works fine and so does <i>List.map [1;2;3] (fun x -> moderately long, perhaps few lines long function)</i>. Both cases are important for readability. Another example: in Haskell I&#x27;ve been working with APIs where functions have 20+ positional parameters (yeah, it&#x27;s terrible design but that&#x27;s out of my hands). If they were named and some of them optional (most of them really are optional) then the code would be a fraction of what it is.<p>OCaml is quick to compile. I&#x27;ve been looking at Eliom web framework recently and rebuilding a website takes seconds; compare that to yesod which takes forever and spins all the cores on my laptop which eats my battery in no time.<p>OCaml code tends to be quite straightforward: from my experience it is longer than Haskell equivalent, uses less abstractions but at the same time it is conceptually simple.<p>Typed printf.

Of course, none of that argues against the conclusion that $99 gives them more revenue than $9.99.",1404825202

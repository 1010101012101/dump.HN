What standards of evidence would it want, to conclude that a company was not secretly assisting in surveillance?<p>&quot;Yes, they might look like a well adjusted person, but so did <person that was secretly a serial killer>! So maybe they are one!&quot; Is not sufficient to conclude that a random, seemingly well adjusted person is likely to be a serial killer. Thats not really quite whats going on here, but it seems possible that it isn&#x27;t /entirely/ unlike it?<p>This seems to be sort of a wink-nudge thing accusing greenwald of being a pawn of the govt, and I don&#x27;t think it provides sufficient evidence to justify making that accusation.<p>Even if Greenwald&#x27;s claim about what the prime motivations of the nsa et all are is false, that would not necessarily mean that it is deceptive.<p>And then it ends with a &quot;oh he probably wont respond to this because he is a TOOL OF THE POWERS THAT BE&quot; type thing.<p>I do wonder if some of the points it makes at the beginning might be good, but I got a sort of, feel from it, reminiscent of either tabloids or , well, I hesitate to use the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, because a prediction that there is a conspiracy about something is not necessarily incorrect or unjustified. So, I don&#x27;t mean &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; in the literal sense, but in the figurative sense of, /relatively unjustified/ idea of a group being involved in a bad conspiracy.",1448949497

And that function is the development, production and distribution of goods and services.<p>But they have to operate within a framework of rules which ensure (to some extent) they fulfill these functions without impacting society negatively (excessively so at least) and that their net benefit to society is a plus. These rules change from time to time.<p>There isn&#x27;t a reason that long term externalized costs should be allowed to be pushed onto society as a whole in the interests of these entities realizing short term profits. That happens far too often and will be the death of capitalism as we know it if left unchecked. We as a society should demand better. Unfortunately, government all too often isn&#x27;t the solution to the problem and the cures it provides are sometimes worse than what was attempting to be cured.

10653859,comment,10644381,10653250,0,0,fenomas,,,"> boils down to asking &quot;how do I think the person chose?&quot;<p>I agree, but the operative word is &quot;think&quot;. We can&#x27;t talk about how the opponent chose, only about the player&#x27;s expectations of how they chose. And talking about how evidence affects expectations is the problem Bayes exists to solve, is my reasoning.<p>For your second point, that sounds right but assuming a well-formed high-entropy distribution seems like a very arbitrary thing to do. The player might very naturally, say, consider round numbers more or less likely, or at any rate believe that $50 is a more likely value than $50.01, etc, right?<p>And actually, this point highlights why I think this should be considered as a Bayesian problem. In frequentist terms, one talks about the opponent choosing numbers from some distribution, then the player choosing a strategy based on their expectations about the distribution, then they open their envelope and apply the strategy. If nothing else this approach greatly obscures the most important feature of the puzzle, which is that the player gains new information when they open their envelope. More, it seems somewhat bonkers when considered - if the player chooses a switch value of $10, then opens their envelope and finds $50,000, should they really just apply the strategy they chose based on expectations they now know to have been wildly incorrect? Effectively the player winds up deciding whether to switch based on the fact that they thought $10 was more likely than $20, when one would expect them to reconsider their expectations that they now know to have been wildly off-base.<p>In contrast, the Bayesian version is straightforward, and we can completely describe the player&#x27;s strategy without making any assumptions on how it&#x27;s formed. Specifically, suppose the player starts off with some expectation P(T) that that the total value of both envelopes would be T. Then they open their envelope, find a value of x, and <i>and update their expectations</i>. Then, their strategy depends solely on the ratio between P(1.5x) and P(3x). And we can say all this without even considering whether P is continuous/discrete/etc, or what factors it&#x27;s based on. All we assume is that it&#x27;s defined at the two points that are relevant to a given instance of the puzzle - i.e. that the player can form some expectation of how likely one value is compared to twice as much.<p>I fear I can&#x27;t describe this very well, but does that make any sense?",1448949141

The FBI of course has endless opportunities of plausible deniability, starting with &quot;rogue contractor&quot;.<p>It all boils down to incentives: what exactly do you have to win from disclosing? What is the chance that people will believe you given that you have no evidence? And what would you even expect your audience to do about it?

On the other hand, he is the person most likely to bring Parrot back around to being a good backend for Perl 6, so it has that going for it.<p>Currently no implementation of Perl 6 targets Parrot. Rakudo used to (indeed, was born on Parrot), but suspended support for Parrot in connection with the push to get Rakudo-on-MoarVM up to 6.0.0 quality by Christmas. The Rakudo team were careful not to say they were writing Parrot off, but they also gave no particular criteria for when they would unsuspend it.<p>(I in no way speak for Rakudo or anyone else, but I suspect the implicit criteria for unsuspension are three: Parrot must demonstrate, in code, that being a good backend for Perl 6 is a higher priority than being a good backend for entirely hypothetical other clients; it must undertake, survive, and complete a major decrufting if not re-architecting; and of course, it must be more interesting, for enough people, to target Parrot than to hack Perl 6 on Moar, JVM, JS, Mono, the perl5 VM, p2, WebAssembly, native code, the Factor VM, or whatever else.)<p>There are also those who view MoarVM as the new Parrot -- Parrot as it would have been if its implementation hadn&#x27;t started until it was clear what Perl 6 would really need under it.

However, the pervasive and distributed nature of information gathering and dissemination in the Internet age opens that abstraction up to people in a way that simply wasn&#x27;t possible when all media was &quot;black boxes&quot; (television, radio, newspaper, etc.) Media now encompasses people uploading footage to Youtube from their phones in the middle of a war zone.<p>The premise of Baudrillard&#x27;s argument as I understand it - that the model of reality created by media is useless fiction and propaganda, which must, one assumes, be rejected out of hand as postmodernists seem to want to do - has possibly become more tenuous over time. Although some would (and do) assert that the fabrication of reality by corporate and government interests has only exploded exponentially and become even more pervasive, and that the appearance of fine-grained truth presented by social media is, itself, only a more elaborate set of lies.<p>This phenomenon, by which reality is described through abstractions and attempts at narrative, is everywhere - and it&#x27;s arguably unavoidable, given that the very nature of human consciousness is a post-hoc hallucination generated by the unreliable narrator that is the brain. Should science dismiss all of its theories as incredulous nonsense because its models are falsifiable? Of course not, because even imperfect models can be useful. What exactly are we to be left with, if we must reject abstraction? We cannot reject it, we are it.<p>It is likely true, however, that for many people the rest of the world exists primarily in the form of a set of packaged narratives or curated experiences presented on an electronic screen or a device. There is also possibly a discussion worth having on the ever-shifting definitions of &quot;war&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; and just and unjust conflict in the modern age, because to an extent, the arbiters of these definitions exist as ghosts in the machine.<p>Unfortunately, I had to wade through the cesspool of comments in the linked article and the Wikipedia page on Jean Beaudrillard to even get a superficial idea of what it was even talking about.

Apart from performance cost, the most important is IMHO understandability. If you don&#x27;t have explicit types across module boundaries, it can easily become hard to decide just what a type is supposed to be, e.g. if your code doesn&#x27;t compile, but the compiler cannot tell you which part of it is wrong, because all the types are inferred.

Same if some new library version changes type inference patterns, your code might suddenly break in surprising and hard to understand ways.<p>I think TypeScript&#x27;s (& Go&#x27;s) choice of local type inference is a good mix of less boilerplate and good understandability, together with gradual typing via `any`.",1448947560

Multi-day periods where I didn&#x27;t have a conversation with another person. Honestly, there were times I felt bad about it, but most of the time I was alone - but not lonely.<p>Currently I have a pretty active social life - I rarely eat alone, I have a wide circle of friends and date fairly actively (I am still single though :/). I think the best way to break out is to make a habit of trying to do things you haven&#x27;t done before. Whether it&#x27;s some athletic pursuit (tennis, rock climbing, etc.) or maybe getting involved in your community (volunteering, religious groups), modern society offers plenty of venues for meeting people. You say you&#x27;re in college so for you it might be as simple as joining a club.<p>Now even though I have ample opportunity to be around other people, I still choose to be alone some times. After a day spent with a group I usually need an hour or so alone to &quot;recharge&quot; - I guess I&#x27;m just naturally introverted.<p>Finally, allow me quote the following poem by Walt Whitman.<p><pre><code>  To You.\n\n  STRANGER! if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak to me, \n  why should you not speak to me?	 \n  \n  And why should I not speak to you?</code></pre>",1448946140

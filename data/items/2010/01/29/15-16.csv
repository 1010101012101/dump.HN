He wrote: <i>Perhaps the iPad signals an end to the “hacker era” of digital history.</i> I disagreed with the sentiment. So, not killing programming, but killing the hacker era.<p><i>On Hacker News, you call people who love to tinker with computers obsessive and label what they do ""fucking around"" and ""non meaningful"" (as judged by your Omniscient Wisdom?) and still claim not to be trolling?</i><p>I'm in the community because I think people here know what they're talking about, not because I agree with their life views. In a past life (by which I mean last year) I got engulfed in a huge and marvelous debate here over that. I don't like the hacker mindset here and I think the entrepreneurial one we see here is sadly limited in scope. A lot of the things HN really enjoys I find a little disturbing and sad.<p>I'm not pretending my opinion is Omniscient Wisdom. Your saying it makes the both of us looks silly. I don't come from quite the background a lot of this community does, and my worldviews are slightly different, but I don't lash out at people that disagree with me — unless it's a debate happening about something I wrote, in which case I maintain the tone I started in the article to help and elucidate things.<p>If we want to make this a discussion of the worldview in question, and of exactly what I believe about what, then by all means we can have that, but the fact that your attitude's more snark than it is polite engagement suggested to me that you're more into shooting me down under false pretenses.",1264780567

1086695,comment,1086484,1086484,0,0,chime,,,"In 2001, I bought my first LCD, a 19"" Princeton Graphics monitor for $1200. In 2004, I bought two Dell 19"" for $600 each to replace the original LCD. In 2007, three Dell 19"" LCDs for $400 each to replace the two Dells. Now, I can buy six 23"" LCDs for approx. $200 each for a total cost of about $1200. It's funny how the number of monitors continues to increase while the total nominal investment remains constant.<p>I had been talking on and on for years about getting a 6-LCD setup and I'd even predetermined what I'd do with each LCD in a 3x2 layout (top1: IM/Chat, 2: Graphics Editor, 3: Putty/Shell, bottom 4: FTP/Explorer, 5: Text Editor, 6: Browsers). My techie friends laughed at me but at a resolution of about 2048x1152/LCD, I would have ample resolution for just about everything and I wouldn't have to alt-tab at all. My productivity in web-dev would absolutely sky-rocket. And since could rig my own stand instead of buying a $600 one, I could get my dream-setup for about $1500. I had built my workstation in 2007 to easily handle 6 DVI ports when the time was right. Now all I needed was an excuse to splurge.<p>Last month, two of my Dell 19"" died, leaving me with just one monitor. My wife joked that I needed new monitors because she didn't wanna be married to some one-LCD guy. She practically kicked me out of bed and told me to find my 6-LCD X-Mas gift. I spent three hours surfing Newegg, Dell Outlet etc. and finally found my dream setup. Right before I clicked 'Place Order' I yelled out ""Honey if I click this button, I'm never leaving my computer room."" I don't think she heard me but I clearly did and for some weird reason I didn't like it. I cleared my cart and started looking for a laptop instead.<p>I've always been anti-laptops because come on, how can you even compare a 3 or 6-LCD setup to a laptop with a tiny screen, tiny keyboard, and crappy batteries. However, something went off in my head at that point and I realized I didn't want my perfect 6-LCD setup even though it was right there in front of me. I have wanted 6-LCDs every single day for the past decade - ever since I started making web-apps. But it was when I yelled that I don't want to leave my room that I realized that I actually do want to leave my room. Now I take my laptop with me everywhere I go and program whenever/wherever I want to. It's a very big change for me and my productivity has definitely taken a hit. However, my desire to code has risen and that is important. Who cares if I'm capable of being highly productive if I don't feel like it most of the time? I guess the take-home lesson here is that it is not the specs but the environment and experience the setup fosters. I still might buy my 6-LCDs someday, if I ever have a crazy do-or-die startup idea, but for now, I'm just happier with a laptop.",1264780443

As the author argues in the article, most of the functions of universities can be covered more efficiently and more cheaply online. For example, lectures are obsolete.

Currently, every university has its own set of lecturers, even for basic things.<p>It used to be that Higher Education was not something that everyone did.

My blog is written for the potpourri audience of artists and literati and young adults that enjoy long essays written about random subjects. It's not a coding blog, so even when I write about subjects that interest people here I'm not writing it in a way that'll appeal to readers here. This article was submitted three times; the first time I asked that it be killed and the submitter graciously killed it for me. This is not of a tone appropriate for Hacker News.<p>But that does not make it a troll post. I wrote a post last month describing fictional Listerine commercials.

First of all, it gives you a visual indication on the icon of every currently running app, including the Apple ones that are always running like Phone, Mail, Safari, and iPod.

Third, it passes the number one use case very handily:  I can listen to Pandora while surfing in Safari seamlessly, and it almost makes my iPhone seem like a functional computer.<p>iPhone 3GS with backgrounder is seriously a powerful device, and lets me have an insight into how powerful the iPad will be.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fanboy.

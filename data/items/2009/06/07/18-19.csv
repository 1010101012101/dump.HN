I notice Google leads by a significant margin. Is Bing looking better than it really is? Who knows, but while I don't plan to switch away from Google, Bing is OK by me - the quality of results are pretty good and its fast. Yahoo not so much (and I got no Yahoo results to my tests at this site) but I'd given up on Yahoo search before Google came along.<p>You assume it's a one-off search and that the users are simply licking randomly on whatever they see that's immediately interesting. I see no justification for this assumption. Personally, I did what I did with any new search engine: perform 10 searches on topics ranging from topical to deeply obscure, and look at the first 5 results for each search to evaluate the quality of both the returned sites and the text clips for each.<p>If this was the subject of a paper submitted to the journal of information processing, you'd have a valid point.

646159,comment,645178,645510,0,0,anatoly,,,"I used to be obsessed with finding out what kind of real thoughts, really important ideas postmodernism, poststructuralism etc. had to offer. I read a lot of ""French theory"" and secondary literature - not enough to have a really thorough grounding, but enough, I think, to be able to form my own judgements. Even though I can't remember most of it anymore, I don't think it was a waste of time. If you're not trying, maybe not daily but constantly, to test your own worldview for emergent dogmatism, you're doing it wrong. It's always worth it to kick something outside the borders of your worldview and see if it kicks back, although not every something is an equally worthy candidate.<p>Having read a bunch of original monographs and articles, a a stack of scathing critiques and even more scathing countercritiques, having went through two graduate seminars on Derrida and postmodernism (not for credit - I was studying math at the time), luckily with a professor who welcomed criticism, here's what my very personal opinion comes down to:<p>1. Most of it is bunk. There's just no escaping it. However, that's not necessarily a strong point against it, because see Sturgeon's Law.<p>2. Occassionally, some of it contains real insight, thoughts of depth and value; unfortunately, you have to work really hard to get to them, as they're shrouded by murkiness and vagueness to a degree that's quite astonishing. The thing is, postmodernists will tell you (and, in so many words, so will the primary texts) that this vagueness and murkiness is necessary; that there's no way to approach the deep thoughts except by deconstructing language and thought themselves. Well, I ain't buying that (I've tried very hard to buy that, it just won't get bought). In all cases where I actually reached something I thought was valuable, all the junk on the way only hindered, never helped - the horrible jargon, the bureaucratic sentences, the nonsensical code-words, the weak and unstable pulse of the argument. I remain convinced that none of this is necessary, and it's there simply because the culture encourages bad writing, in which it's easier to hide pure bunk (see 1.).<p>I offer Derrida as an example of a postmodern (well, poststructuralist) author who has Something To Say. In particular, after some wrangling and exasperation, I grew to appreciate his Dissemination, especially the first part, Plato's Pharmacy, which offers some brilliant observations on Phaedrus and the nature of writing (again, if you can plough your way through to them, etc.). I recommend this. I've never read his more famous Of Grammatology, and not sure I will now.<p>3. The quality of writing varies wildly from one author to another, even if we restrict to the most famous ones. Lacan is bullshit, pure and simple. Don't waste your time on him. Foucault seems to have been a shoddy scholar whose theories fall apart when you look at the evidence closer. Baudrillard I've come to regard as a sort of a gifted stand-up artist with an ear for impressive aphorism.<p>With all the occassional good stuff I found while reading postmodernist literature and arguing with friends about it, I couldn't possibly ""follow"" it in any meaningful way because of these (again, my personal opinion, etc.) flaws:<p>a) culture that accepts and encourages texts of very poor quality. This is more damning than 1. above; this <i>makes sure</i> the shit rises to the top. Most of writing is so obscure that it's not possible to refute it: there's nothing solid to get hold of to refute. Behind this obscurity is a huge amount of parroting, bad thinking and simply nonsense, and nothing in the intellectual postmodenist life encourages you to try to separate the wheat from the chaff; in fact, you're the enemy if you think wheat and chaff can possibly be separated, or even exist in any objective way. Think of the Bogdanov affair others recalled in comments here. In Sokal, outsiders (a physicist, other scientists, journalists) criticized  the ""postmodernists"", who counter-attacked in the ""culture wars"". In Bogdanov, physicists and mathematicians themselves attacked the apparently nonsensical work, and the debate was between scientists. There's a huge difference here.<p>b) the double standards that pervade all texts and thought. Postmodern authors almost never scrutinize their own assumptions as critically as they scrutinize, say, the assumptions of modernists. It gets ridiculous after a while, because you find it hard to believe that someone can, say, claim that all ideologies are equally suspect and we must denounce the very possibility of knowledge itself if we are to get to the bottom of it all; and then in the next paragraph prostrate themselves dogmatically before some other thinker and quote their claims with all the reverence of Gospel truth, obviously bearing universally validity. You keep thinking, wait, it must be a joke, but the punchline never comes. Another way in which this annoyed me was how inevitably almost all those guys were ideologically extreme leftists, usually Marxists. It's not even the ideology itself that irked me the most, it's how unimaginable it was to see anything else, how dogmatically it pervaded everything, and never got a fraction of critical attention that was lavishly spent on, say, the idea of objective truth, or the simulacra in modern capitalist society. These are just two most obvious examples, but really, the amount of double standard going on, the lack of reflection at one's own thoughts is very irritating. At the end, I couldn't accept it even as a worthy way of exploring the world that's simply alien to me. I couldn't escape the conclusion that almost all of it was junk, sometimes very attractive intellectually - and therefore dangerous - junk; with some surprising exceptions, like some of Derrida I talked of above, which don't, after all, change the overall picture.",1244400015

This isn't a purely academic exercise as I'm planning on launching a startup in the next couple months and this is an issue I have to grapple with. Rather than speaking in generalities I'll layout an example.  Say you are Pandora and you are building the first music recommendation engine or you are Farecast and building the first prediction model for airline tickets. These companies spent years developing their predictive technologies and they are assuredly extremely comprehensive and robust.  However, say they gave themselves a 2 month deadline and released a service which they strove to improve over time.  Their service was not nearly as prescient as it could be if they took 3-4 years to develop it. Still, there was some data analysis that went into the service and Pandora and Farecast could advertise that fact on the website and indicate that the results will get better over time.<p>How many users would these services have lost?  Some users will be dissatisfied with the services so they would lose potential customers. Also, another competitor could see that they could do better and launch their own service, diluting the market share for these comapnies. But these companies sacrificed revenue by not releasing their service until it was very strong. Also, there are other companies that took years of work and flopped miserably upon release. Farecast and Pandora faced the risk of joining that unenviable pool.<p>It's hard to argue that Farecast and Pandora went down the wrong path since they were super-successful startups. But if I'm not mistaken, both started in academia so they have a higher standard to live up to in terms of rigor. Most startups are under the pressure to launch something quickly.

The 'intellectual pollution' consists of exactly one supposed change in the way we raise our children: following our intuition instead of some guidebook.

Derrida uses the term ‘realism’ to denote the paradigm, and subsequent futility, of postcultural truth. In a sense, subdialectic textual theory holds that the task of the writer is significant form.<p>“Society is part of the paradigm of narrativity,” says Debord; however, according to Dietrich[9] , it is not so much society that is part of the paradigm of narrativity, but rather the genre, and some would say the dialectic, of society. Foucault uses the term ‘realism’ to denote the role of the poet as artist. However, Parry[10] states that we have to choose between dialectic objectivism and precapitalist deappropriation.<p>Any number of situationisms concerning capitalist discourse may be discovered. But the example of subdialectic textual theory intrinsic to Joyce’s Dubliners is also evident in Ulysses, although in a more mythopoetical sense.<p>Lacan uses the term ‘capitalist discourse’ to denote the common ground between reality and sexual identity. Thus, Lyotard’s essay on subdialectic textual theory implies that the law is capable of truth.<p>Baudrillard promotes the use of textual narrative to deconstruct hierarchy. In a sense, several materialisms concerning the futility, and eventually the paradigm, of subdialectic culture exist.<p>The characteristic theme of the works of Joyce is the role of the reader as observer. However, in Finnegan’s Wake, Joyce deconstructs realism; in Ulysses, although, he analyses capitalist discourse.",1244398770

The author was born in 1964 (source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Deresiewicz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Deresiewicz</a>), which makes him the same age as me.  Thus we probably attended Yale as undergraduates at the same time.  Yet I recognize absolutely none of the dynamics that he describes.  It is never quite clear what he is narrating from his own remembered student experience versus what he is surmising from observing Lit students around him.<p>Now, I didn't attend an elite prep school (quite the converse), nor did I remain in the academy after graduating (no loss for the academy, given my GPA...).  So perhaps I received a subtherapeutic dose of whatever has saddled him with such despair.  But I have no problem communicating with my fellow rural firefighters, a merry mix of garbagemen, carpenters, surveyors, innkeepers, pastors, snowplow repairmen, and the occasional stray programmer.  I can take commands from an irrigation pipe salesman or a backhoe operator.  They can do things I can't do, while I can do things they can't do; there is mutual respect.  Occasionally they tease me for employing a sixty-four dollar word when a ninety-eight cent word would do, but we maintain communication, and we value our differences.<p>Certainly, my experience as as member of the pampered elite must have been very different from his.

And both the children of white-collar and blue-collar workers are largely ending up in the latter economy.

3366151,comment,3365742,3366106,2,0,necro,,,"I think we're getting at the same thing. The time example is used as a comparative generalization that there is a need to focus and understand the fundamentals.  The point being that given some period of time, if an average individual chooses to learn 10 languages at once, they probably wont master the fundamentals, compared to mastering those in one language.  Of course there is the side case that comparing different languages and their patterns will actually be even more valuable in overall understanding, I would have to side that one first needs a deep enough understanding for that to be an advantage.",1324191300

Intellectual ""property"" has few of the attributes of property; concepts rooted in exclusive use of something don't work well for things that are intrinsically not limited to single users.<p>What you really seem to have a problem with, though, is your inability to separate mechanisms from goals. The <i>goal</i> of copyright is to incentivize production. The <i>mechanism</i> is government-enforced monopolies over intangible things which, for legal purposes, are treated as property.<p>The main problem is that the mechanism is breaking down because citizens are becoming more powerful. They have access to technology that permits copying and distribution. This makes cultural IP less property-like, and more language-like.<p>The correct response to this is not to make the mechanism more powerful, especially not a response that actively increases the (necessary) tyranny of government over citizenry. The correct response is to create a different mechanism for incentivizing creative work, one that is robust in the face of increasing citizen sovereignty.<p>I mentioned in another comment here a tax redistributed based on popularity, as measured by fingerprinting playback. That's just one idea.<p>But when you say that I, or people like me, support theft or stealing, or suggest that artists shouldn't get paid, you're simply wrong; worse, you're deeply misguided in what you're attacking.

If you consume the good and do not recompense, then you are depriving the artist of their means of making a living, which takes away their ability to make more art.",1324188829

Whether or not IP exists, society at large needs to mostly agree one way or another, or a lot of people will put a lot of effort into something they wouldn't otherwise, and they won't be reimbursed in the way that convinced them to put in the effort in the first place.",1324188639

I feel like I've accomplished a lot in terms of having a very full home life and a very interesting project, but I still feel a lack in terms of having things ""solved""--Stormpulse is just now finding its legs and I'm nowhere near being the father or husband I hope to become.

Given the way the whole TC/FG thing came off and exploded I am not too surprised about them going dark. One of the quotes Scott McNealy made at Sun has stuck with me over the years, he said ""Running a company is like running a gauntlet of windows that are slamming shut. Trip just once, and the window can slam shut before you pass it."" That really resonated with me and Sun lived with the mindset that tripping was death. The tablet market has had some early folks in it, but they have not been able to use their small size to run faster than the big guys. And Apple of course threw everyone a curve ball.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alwaysinnovating.com/home/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alwaysinnovating.com/home/index.htm</a>",1324188492

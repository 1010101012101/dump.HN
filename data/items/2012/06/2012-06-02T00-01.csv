4056575,comment,4050988,4051611,1,0,evincarofautumn,,,"As mappu mentioned, I was inadvertently paraphrasing Alexander Stepanov, who said it better than I can:<p>I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interestingsaying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.<p>Most of my work has been in game dev and languages, so I may be biased, but the problems I encounter tend to be about 90% dataflow, constraint satisfaction, events, and logic programming, and 10% sequential/imperative code to string it all together. OOP (again, in the Java sense) <i>can</i> model the non-sequential parts, but its just sort of awkward and unpleasant.<p>I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebrasfamilies of interfaces that span multiple types.<p>I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axiomsyou start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms. Only when you understand them well, can you come up with an interface that will let them work.<p>You cant come up with an interface until you know that it actually corresponds to anything. The defining feature of OOP is also its greatest weakness: that it bakes interfaces into datatypes. Modularity is crippled and change is prohibitively difficult, resulting in extensive workarounds (and a proliferation of design patterns).<p>But ultimately, programming is about what you create with it. We can argue about languages and paradigms all day, or we can just make cool stuff however works best for us.",1338598710

In java case that's callback friction (brievity matters to me), the heavy burden of types on variables versus values, a verbose and inarticulate typing system, and like C/C++ and many Algol derivatives a complete paucity of expressive Literals for expressing all data types that can be modelled by the type system.",1338598295

A single act may be consistent with many different interpretations, and the United States could easily be blamed if one of their allies committed some heinous act and justified it using a doctrine they extrapolated from Stuxnet and other acts condoned or committed by the United States.<p>As an analogous example, parents, knowing that many people think in crude categories such as ""drugs"" and ""illegal,"" would not simply pot in front of their children without explanation.  They would not want to discover later that their kids were doing meth or shoplifting and hear, ""What are you angry about?  You smoked illegal drugs right in front of me.  How is this different?""

Don't get me wrong, there's going to be delay as the PHBs get themselves wrapped around what an API even <i>is</i>, but they'll have the directive routed to their CIOs before that, and they will understand the requirement, and how impossible it is.<p>The biggest issue is that the data isn't really owned by the government entities.  I mean, the data is theirs, but it's locked up in their vendor provided tools, and/or their custom, built-by-vendor products.  If they're using Oracle AquaLogic (or whatever it is now) to host the majority of their portal content, they're dependent on Oracle to either come in and show them how to implement the feature (which is a significant service dollar cost) or they're going to have to wait until Oracle builds the ability for API exposure into the product if it doesn't exist yet.<p>If they've got custom-built portals, they'll need to consult with the vendors who wrote them or maintain them now and get them to add that in.  That means that they'll have to modify the contract originally bid for the project, which is going to eat up a couple months of the timeline alone.  Then they'll have to figure out what sort of things actually make it into the API, how to segment sensitive data reliably, get it through ISSO testing, etc.  It's almost impossible for a project of any significance.<p>On top of that, they'll have to do it with a budget they don't have, and with resources allocated elsewhere.

4056514,comment,4055256,4055256,11,0,newbusox,,,"I am a lawyer, and I have, in my own startup, contended with a company attempting to sue me/my startup for allegedly infringing on their trademark.<p>I'm sympathetic to your cause, but playing with intellectual property issues is serious stuff and the reality of the situation is that better-funded players will not infrequently attempt to bully you into getting what they want, as appears to have occurred here. Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but you should have consulted an attorney immediately on receiving a cease-and-desist letter, even if you thought that their claim was entirely frivolous (which, given the facts presented here, is hard to say). Had this occurred, you almost certainly would either not be in this situation, or saved yourself a ton of trouble.<p>Given that you did not and this situation has evolved to what it is, your only choice is to retain an attorney if youd like to continue operate the app and not pay whatever damages they alleged. And, frankly, you're in a poor position because, since the court has already entered a default judgment against you, you will have to show cause as to why the court should set aside this judgment, which will require more time and effort than if you have initially opposed the lawsuit, even if what you say regarding a piece of the document missing is true.<p>If you do retain an attorney and fight this, realize that, if you lose, the opposing side might be able to recoup the entirety of their attorney's fees (which would be very expensive for you, particularly in the unlikely event you went to trial or the like, and it appears that they have already alleged this right now), and, possibly, your profits (depending on a number of factors). That's very serious stuff.<p>I wish I could give more direct advice, and I strongly agree with commenters here in other posts lamenting how elitist law is and so on, but you have absolutely no alternative but to retain an attorney. I don't know where you live and where this litigation is taking place, but there are tons of lawyer referral services out there (your local county bar will have such a service, you can find out on their website), and you can speak to various attorneys who might understand your financial situation and be able to work with whatever budget you have. Just because an attorney says that they charged $X does not mean that you cant find another, competent attorney, who might charge less.  If I were in your position, and wanted to fight this, I would spend my time either finding/raising money, or talking to attorneys about how you can structure a fee schedule that would work with your finances (lawyers are open to negotiating: you can say ""I can only pay you this or that"" or ""I can pay you this or that in the future""see what they say and how flexible they will be). I am skeptical that someone would take your case pro bono.<p>As a general piece of advice based on personal experience to others: don't ignore intellectual property issues. Getting a trademark is not particularly expensive (and, unlike this situation, something that you can, actually, do without consulting an attorney, or at least for little $ should you need to consult an attorney) and can save you headaches in the future. If you receive a cease and desist-type letter, take it seriously, regardless of how frivolous you think their claim is. If whoever sent you the letter went to the trouble to have their lawyer draft a letter to you--which means that they probably paid the lawyer a non-insignificant fee to do that--they are certainly taking it seriously, and so should you. Even well-funded companies don't throw money away to, of all people, lawyers, unless they think they can get something they want from you, and/or they think they actually have a meritorious claim. Do not attempt to respond to the cease and desist letter, unless you have experience in how to do this. If you want to avoid paying an enormously onerous legal fee, you can try your hand at drafting a responsebut absolutely get a lawyer to look at it prior to sending it. This may be more affordable than you think (~1-2 hour of work, or the like, for a lawyer). If you're worrying that you may be infringing someone else's trademark, or someone will try to sue you in the future (as apparently happened here), you can get a declaratory judgment (for a fee) from a court stating that you're not infringing-again, something to talk to a lawyer about.",1338596687

292640,comment,292351,292474,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yep. I've said the same thing before: 1password for the Mac. You pay $35, once, and suddenly every site on the web supports auto-filling of gigantic automatically-generated strong passwords. You can stash your non-Web passwords in its lockbox, too.<p>There are occasional glitches and annoyances (my pet peeve is that so many of the sites in the world don't actually support long passwords containing symbols). But you can fix the problems, because it's pretty obvious what 1password is doing and the whole thing is right there on your machine.<p>I'm sure there are similar programs for Windows, though I can't recommend one.",1220360124

In web terms, five years is practically as far away as the heat death of the universe.<p>When we're trying to be polite, we geeks adopt the legendary phrasing techniques of the Japanese: We almost never use the word <i>no</i>.

However if you market is the ""movers and shakers"" then you are going to care a lot more about FireFox, Safari and IE8 right now - and will be looking to Google's Chrome to join in and take a share.",1220359520

Do you have anything worthwhile to add about how Chrome could become another closed system?",1220359318

292632,comment,292351,292351,0,0,compay,,,"I spent most of yesterday implementing openid on a site I'm developing.<p>The problem is not the underlying mechanism but rather the way it's been presented on most sites. Remembering an openid url is counterintuitive for most people - you have to explain too much to all but the most technical users in order for them to know what's going on.<p>But now there has been some progress: Yahoo became an openid provider a while back, and they allow you to log in with their openid by simply entering ""Yahoo.com,"" you don't even have to remember your openid URL.<p>I also used JanRain's ID Selector Javascript widget to make the signup form a little more intuitive:<p><a href=""http://www.idselector.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idselector.com/</a><p>So really I think openid is getting much better as it matures and its developer community tweaks it and the tools around it. If Google and Microsoft fully get on board (which they are promising) I think it will see pretty widespread adoption.",1220358974

We should be able to make it no matter what the economy is doing.Our success should not depend on macro conditions.  But I would guess the better our macro view, the better we can pick areas that we might want to explore further at the startup level.<p>Not sure. Perhaps macro conditions don't matter at all.

I currently have space on 6 different hosts and i'm wondering if there is any practical way to use them all effectively. They only thing i can come up with is to be redirected to a server that is currently up. Right now I simply have everything mirrored on all the hosts ready to switch DNS if something were to happen. This however doesn't solve much and takes a bit more work with dynamic sites. It would be nice ot hear what others are doing to ensure great uptime.",1220357581

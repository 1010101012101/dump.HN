2671862,comment,2670876,2671699,1,0,hugh3,,,"<i>Personally, I think history is best taught when it has a narrative. Hence, textbooks are not good at teaching history</i><p>I disagree. Teaching history as a narrative is the most dangerous thing you can do with history, because there's always the temptation to shoehorn it into a narrative. Good guys vs bad guys. Heroes and villains. Plucky underdogs vs arrogant empires. The human mind is stupid, and there's only a certain number of narratives which ""feel"" right to us, and the moment you start reducing reality in its vast complexity so it sounds like a good story, you've lost most of what was going on.<p>For example, what you just said:<p><i>What Halberstam makes abundantly clear is how dangerous what they were doing was. Simply, they could have been killed. Some of them very nearly were. And there were people killed, but they obviously weren't around for Halberstam to interview. The corollary to that is he drives home how naked some of the violence against the protestors was.</i><p>What about the violence committed <i>by</i> the protestors? Were there no evil acts committed by folks on the ""good"" side of this conflict? I assume there were (there always are) but these get left behind in the search of the simplified one-liner version of the ""Civil Rights struggle"" narrative.<p>History as narrative is more entertaining than real history, but it's also a lot less accurate. You might as well just watch Star Wars.",1308516538

Reddit is another oft-quoted ""horrible"" design. Yahoo, msn also. It almost seems as if all the most popular sites on the planet are ""horribly designed"". Almost by definition this can't be true.<p>Personally I find both HN and SO great in terms of design. They're extremely easy to navigate, functionality and calls-to-action are clear and obvious. Data is presented in a meaningful and easy-to-read uncluttered manor. I'm not a design student (by any stretch of the imagination) but for the life of me I wouldn't be able to begin to guess what's so bad about either of these sites, unless it's the lack of super-whizzy glossy css3/js/ajax/flash magic that's the problem.

Its actually so good, that I never (well - almost never) bothered to look for anything else. All my questions were answered by the official documentation.</i><p>I have a different opinion. The Django docs are good, but not great. Here's how I see them right now:<p><pre><code>    - Combination of overview, how-to, and API reference.\n</code></pre>\nInstead, I'd like to see it split up like so:<p><pre><code>    - Overview section.\n    - How-To section.\n    - API reference.\n</code></pre>\nThe overview section should cover general concepts. ""This is what a View is, how it relates to URLConf, etc..."".<p>The how-to section should show you how to do certain things. ""Here's example code of how you can configure settings.py, how to handle an HTTPRequest in a view function, etc..."".<p>The API reference, just a list of Django objects (showing inheritance), their attributes, functions, and parameters.

2671820,comment,2669734,2670870,1,0,autotelicum,,,"Well, I did not say that I really wanted to support other formats. Here are my reasons:<p>JavaScript has always possessed an inner, lisp-like beauty. CoffeeScript allows that beauty to shine through the surface of the syntax. I have tried in Smooth CoffeeScript to let the visual design reflect that in the way the code and text is presented.<p>I mentioned that I have tried converters and realized what the problems are (beyond lacking support for hyphenation, kerning and ligatures). The book's text is interspersed with code in a fixed width font. Line breaks and hyphenation marks has to be avoided as much as possible in inline code, because they can be highly confusing - does it mean a minus there or what? Then comes CoffeeScript's whitespace awareness, that means that code blocks have to be scaled, it is very confusing to use word wrapping. I have had to hand manage the typesetting by sometimes tweaking the code text, the font sizes or rewriting sentences to avoid formatting issues.<p>All my devices are capable of presenting pdf quite well, so I have also not felt the need to produce other formats. I checked at <a href=""http://ebook-reader-review.toptenreviews.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebook-reader-review.toptenreviews.com/</a> and it seems all ebook readers have some support for pdf.<p>If the reason for other formats is to avoid Adobe, then on the Mac there is a built-in preview utility with excellent pdf support. On Windows Google Chrome has its own pdf support built-in. With this book Chrome does say that there is something it could not render correctly, but I have not been able to find what that something might be. It looks good to me.<p>Creating the book in pdf has been quite labour intensive - maybe due to my lack of experience in this kind of work - so the prospect of repeating that a couple of times for HTML and EPUB does not appeal much to me. If someone else feels strongly enough about this to dedicate their time and energy to it - and uses freely available tools to do it - then I will be happy to host the result on the project site.",1308515669

So obviously, I think it's pretty damn cool that someone ported his book to CoffeeScript (albeit with modified examples). The inclusion of Underscore.js as a standard library is, I think, also quite sensible.<p>Of course, there's a fundamental philosophical difference between my book and Smooth CoffeeScript, which is highlighted on the book's front page:<p>> Why no JavaScript? Because it is difficult enough to learn one programming language at a time. This book does not assume knowledge of JavaScript or another language.<p>I, on the other hand, think that it's important to understand JavaScript in order to work with CoffeeScript, and that CoffeeScript is not well-suited to being a first programming language. The situation will improve as tools for debugging CoffeeScript become available, but even then, it's unlikely that you'll use CoffeeScript for a real project without reading documentation (and code) for libraries written in JavaScript.<p>But hey, I'm happy to see anything that gets more people hooked on CoffeeScript. :)",1308515365

This is a valid reason.<p>2. They offer easier concurrency than most alternatives. It's straightforward (though not quite easy, unless you have transactional memory) to make a lock-free concurrent skip list. Try that with a heap or a red-black tree, and you'll quickly run into all sorts of memory conflicts and crazy-complicated locking. The fact that a skip list only provides probabilistic logarithmic time bounds really makes coordination between threads easier.<p>(Note that it's possible to do some similar stuff with modified versions of other data structures. For example, you can make a good concurrent dictionary by taking a red-black tree, relaxing the invariants, and adding a periodic rebalancing thread to run in the background. But that's a topic too long to fit into this post.)",1308514086

What Halberstam makes abundantly clear is how <i>dangerous</i> what they were doing was. Simply, they could have been killed. Some of them very nearly were. And there were people killed, but they obviously weren't around for Halberstam to interview. The corollary to that is he drives home how naked some of the violence against the protestors was.<p>Something I took away is how sanitized the teaching of the civil rights movement has become. By doing that, we diminish what those young people actually did, and we conveniently forget how cruel humans can be.<p>Personally, I think history is best taught when it has a narrative. Hence, textbooks are not good at teaching history. Books with a focused topic - which hopefully implies a focused narrative - are much more compelling.

However, I really have a hard time coming to the same conclusions regarding the cause of the problem, and solutions that he seems to present. Overall Postman ends up coming across as a whiny evangelical who seem to conclude that the prudish victorian era was the height of society, discourse, and learning, that we should all strive to recreate. I feel that for someone who claims to have drawn on the ideas of McLuhan, he rather seems to have missed McLuhan's main points.  If Postman had observed McLuhan's message more closely he might have seen that the only way around the issues with TV and modern media are to embrace it and actively take time out in public education to demonstrate exactly what it is, why it captivates us so much, and what tricks are used in the media to try to deceive us. I still believe that is our only hope for overcoming the issues American society faces with satiating itself with media and gossip.<p></i>Even though the tactics in place are changing, thanks to the BNW approach to appeasing society, the majority seem to be blind to the 1984 tactics that are being setup around us.",1291949370

1990368,comment,1984841,1985658,0,0,chunkbot,,,"These are hard problems to solve, even approximately, and nothing we're doing is original. Like quantitative finance, a lot of the original research comes from outside the field (ie. ""quasi-clique detection in protein-protein interaction networks""). For those that are interested, there's a lot of information in recent public or easily-available research papers. A weekend spent programming a good idea from a paper is well worth it.<p>For better or worse, we don't use any graph-specific heuristics beyond general assumptions of the graph's structure (which may or may not be correct, but that's another story...).  We're dealing with a massive sparse graph whose vertex set, but not edge set, fits in memory (RAM). Embarrassingly, the edges are stored in a database in MySQL; we might be running the world's largest graph on MySQL, but I think we get better performance from MySQL than we could from any other products. Needless to say, we're not using <i>anything</i> relational. Like a lot of graphs (the Web, social networks, etc.), the number of edges is several orders of magnitude larger than the size of the vertex set, so we plan accordingly.<p>Perhaps my use of the term ""partition"" above is incorrect; these aren't perfect partitions (they don't exist, except in theory), but are what's known as ""quasi-cliques"" (the field of graph theory is rife with jargon).<p>We're happy with what we've come up with; contrary to most, the limits we face are mostly due to limited storage capacity rather than limited computation time or network capacity, which is essential for handling growth.<p>Sorry if all of this has been too general; there's not too much I can say specifically without revealing our ""secret sauce"". :D",1291949281

Sure, the basics of use are the same, and someone who used an ancient emacs version could pickup using a modern version reasonably easily, but syntax highlighting, auto-completion, X and GUI support, windowing, multi-file editing, etc. have been added over the years (and that's just stuff I know of, off the top of my head, and I don't even use emacs). The emacs distribution has grown by several orders of magnitude in size since those TOPS-10 and ITS implementations.<p>My point is that Emacs is every bit the editor that Visual Studio editor is, and contains pretty much all the same features, and a lot that Visual Studio will never have. And, more importantly, the most productive developers I've ever known used either emacs or vim...I can't think of a single <i>great</i> developer that uses Visual Studio (I'm sure they exist, but I've yet to meet one). It's just idiotic to claim that emacs is an ineffective tool when the evidence is so strong that it is extremely effective for millions of developers.",1291949098

1990329,comment,1989962,1990182,0,0,anonymo,,,"""As his famed opponent Arthur Wellesley (Wellington) said after defeating Napoleon the final time: ""They came on in the same old way and we defeated them in the same old way.""""<p>Cute, except that Waterloo was Wellington's one and only victory over Bonaparte. It was the only time they met on the battle field, and even then, Michel Ney made most of the tactical decisions (and mistakes) on that day.<p>Remembering Napoleon for Waterloo rather than Austerlitz, Ulm and Jena would be like remembering Hannibal for Zama. The fact that his name has become synonymous with his unremarkable defeat on that day, and that Wellington, a reactionary, anti-democratic, ennobled aristocrat, is somehow looked upon with favor in this country (America), even more so than his adversary who was an ally of America, who doubled the size of our country with the Louisiana Purchase and who actually planned on settling here after his second abdication, is a testament to the lasting power of the British anti-Bonapartist propaganda industry. More books were written about Napoleon in the 19th century than about any other man, living or dead, and most English languages books on him were written by Brits, and most of those books vilified him as the Corsican Ogre, the Great Usurper and so on. Were it not for this cottage industry that sprang up during the Napoleonic Era and lingered long after, most Americans would probably still have a favorable view of Napoleon as they did during his lifetime.",1291948554

Remember, <i>those who don't have</i> are the ~50% of the population who don't go to postsecondary education.<p>(And don't try to claim that this is because they can't afford the associated costs; studies have repeatedly found that the costs of higher education are a very very minor factor in determining students' postsecondary attendance.  The largest determining factor, by far, is the educational qualifications of students' parents.)",1291946981

He can wax poetic about new iOS features and iOS brilliance, singing to his choir, but he has no perspective or relevance to preach about Android. His overwhelming bias (and years or snark) has eliminated his ability to play the voice for any other platform.<p>No one should take that as anti-Gruber. It isn't. It's just that Gruber made his ""iOS or nothing"" bed over the past couple of years, leaving him looking a bit clownish when he tries to play peacemaker.",1291946762

Not flying on a given trip doesn't reduce the amount of CO2 because the plane will fly anyway and either the weight reduction difference will be negligible in terms of CO2 or they'll just take more freight.<p>Then the counter argument to that is that if enough people don't fly the airplane won't fly at all...

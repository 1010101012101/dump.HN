3521426,comment,3521309,3521388,9,0,apsurd,,,"(I maintain jekyllboostrap)\nTwo main differences:<p>1) The core implementation difference is that Octopress is customized through Jekyll plugins whereas JB is customized through native liquid code.<p>2) JB's purpose is to build a standardized API for Jekyll Blogs. Octopress has no such api.<p>1) Has a few consequences. Since GitHub Pages does not run any plugins, Octopress basically pre-processes your website and then pushes the final rendered pages to GitHub for hosting. JB is able to just push your change itself and GitHub takes care of the Jekyll processing. \nThis has a couple advantages. Firstly your codebase is cleaner (I'm a developer and that mattered to me =x) and secondly for larger blogs (imagine 1k posts) you are basically letting GitHub do all the work rather than preprocessing it yourself.<p>TBH the plugin thing has become something of a debate with me. I originally _challenged_ myself to not use plugins because I just wanted to make a damned blog, I didn't see why Liquid needed to be so damned difficult. So I'd thought I'd save other people the hassle of figuring out liquid. But I can see how people don't mind hosting a pre-processed website if it means getting what they want.<p>2) \nThe plugin problem highlights the need for a stadardized api. It's very easy to use plugins to do everything you want for your blog. But your work doesn't benefit the larger community because there is not an established integration point for plugins. Jekyll is like 4 years old and there are a ton of plugins but nobody cares because its <i>still</i> too hard to get up and running. You need to read the docs for <i>every single plugin</i> to integrate it. Jekyll community is segmented exactly because of plugins imo.<p>With JB my (technical) goal is to build a common API for Jekyll-based blogs. An api for themes will mean plug-n-play theming. An api for javascript will mean badass javascript plugins that <i>drop in</i>. Ideally I'd like to make community support (js widget that allows people to follow, like, vote, explore, blogs etc).<p>Octopress supports nor advocates no such api. It has a (very nice) theme but no theme API so you can't just install a theme.<p>Honestly I think Octopress is a lot more fine-tuned <i>at this point</i>. But I'm trusting that once the APIs are solidified, you will see a larger community developed around the JB framework which collectively means everyone's experience will only improve.<p>I'd say stick with Octopress if you are comfortable customizing it to fit your needs. Go with JB if your main goal is to run a technical blog and (eventually) benefit from ""JB community"" improvements, themes, js plugins, etc.<p>Btw Brandon Mathis (<a href=""https://github.com/imathis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/imathis</a>) has given me great advice on how he promoted octopress and made it into what it is today so I definitely take inspiration and respect his work =).",1327728985

If you pay $555 now, you'll get decent service.<p>Furthermore, I think you might have a skewed sense of what a fair price is to fly 2,500 miles. A flight from Lisbon to Moscow (about the same distance) is more expensive than a flight from LA to NYC. It is a long way and expensive to operate planes. Last minute tickets and upper class tickets subsidize ""cheap"" fares. If you want to convert an airline over to fixed price tickets, the ticket price would likely be considerably higher than what you deem ""fair.""<p>Finally, the way cities are built in the US does not lend themselves to public transit. NYC has decent transit because the population density is so high as to make it the only viable option. There are no other cities in the US like that with the exception of maybe San Francisco which has a significantly smaller population. In Europe, many cities are high density and have good mass transit. Unless we encourage density, we're unlikely to see good urban mass transit since most people would rather drive all things being equal.",1327727970

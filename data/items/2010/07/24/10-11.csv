The IP?<p>Make a spreadsheet showing your projected income, followed by the amount of money ending up in each pocket.  Do this as a cash-flow projection.  Now divide your revenue figures by 10 and see what happens.  Can you live with that?<p>Now compare with borrowing 25k at 10%pa.  You end up with all the revenues, but you might not cover your loan.  Where does that interest percentage break even with the deal you are getting?<p>What do you bring to this deal?  Why should you get any money at all?  Why not sell them the idea for $X and then move on to your next idea?<p>That's your homework - no doubt other HNers will have more to add.",1279969060

If you are using the fast bandwidth provided to download a file and have it nearly instantly, that's great. It is wonderful to be able to watch YouTube videos without buffering, to get entire webpages in the blink of an eye, and to install an OS over the network without wishing you had splurged for the Cd's. But as soon as you provide something like that, you get some asshole who thinks that it is then his right to use that speed /constantly/, doing nothing but downloading files day and night. If everyone does this, there is no more bandwidth to go around: the expectation is that users will use ""up to 5MB/s"" only for a few seconds, not for days at a time. You might even say a fair allotment of the finite bandwidth resource might be ""5MB/s, or 100MB/min, or 1GB/hour"", despite those numbers not even remotely multiplying out. And this is, in fact, how many ISP's are now trying to solve the problem of people who don't understand the concept of sharing: ""burst rates"", where as you use bandwidth it slows down over short time spans.",1279968396

A few years ago, I had a project that blew through 3 dozen developers over a 15 month period because everyone checked out okay until they started to code.  Then they'd crack and say ""Oh, this is beyond my abilities"".  Ultimately, we found two developers that did the project in no time (and whom we now treat as well as we possibly can).  We were lucky.  I suspect a lot of projects sink in the mire of mediocrity.",1279966881

Now, computers are appliances.  And even the most reliable appliances, as the old Maytag adverts used to show, require trained ""technicians"".

I am venturing into my own startup.I dont have a lot of money or the resources to develop the software I need to. I have come across a company that is willing to help me out. Here are the terms, tell me if this makes sense or if im giving to much out and being naive. The software will cost me 25k, im giving 20% equity and 2 years of Rev sharing at 30%. out of that 30% for RS, 30% is coming back to me for future software dev. Also the 25k is to be paid through the Rev Sharing deal, nothing coming out of my pocket. The reason behind the #s are, I dont have the money or the technical knowledge to do this. They were keen on getting into this business, they lowered the price of the software for me, also they will be my IT/Technical department, which I dont have to worry about. I dont minf giving them equity, but I need to know if 20% is too much, this will be vested over 4 years. Are these numbers ok or should I restructure it and lower equity?",1279965724

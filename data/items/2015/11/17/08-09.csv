10579890,comment,10577102,10578945,0,0,iofj,,,"Not really, actually. This violence was perpetrated by a nation, by something attempting to be a state. That means this is not individuals deciding to do something, this is a network organising these attacks. Yes currently that network is pathetic, but there is an army behind it attempting to learn how to do this better.<p>In history, one can find examples where an enemy shut down an economy by killing civilians, and that doing so is not very hard. Essentially a western economy cannot operate with a weekly terror attack, it would simply freeze (well, in practice that situation lead to a civil war, because a LOT of people get screwed because of the distrust these attacks generate, and to a lesser extent by the security measures). So nation states are extremely wary of these sorts of things.<p>In a way states respond strongly because people respond strongly. Because too few people are willing to carry out their jobs as normal when they get openly confronted with a 1/1 million chance they&#x27;ll be gunned down.<p>In Western Europe, this is a lost fight. The problem, at one point, decades ago, was that islamic ideology does indeed push these sorts of attacks. Raids is what they called it 1500 years ago, but they&#x27;re not all that different. Send out a small force whose sole intention is to kill everyone they find, who have at best a small chance of returning alive. So you can make a very hard to refute argument that this is indeed &quot;islamic&quot;, and muslims are very sensitive to criticism that they&#x27;re not religious enough. Criticism of muslim attacks was silenced in the muslim community itself. Then they replaced pretty much all teachers in a lot of schools. That&#x27;s how it started. That&#x27;s how violence preachers got into schools and mosques, into city hall and ... And yes, it is really organized from islamic religious infrastructure. Even that is not new. Did you know that a &quot;prayer house&quot; is &quot;masjid&quot; in arabic ? What does &quot;mosque&quot; mean ? It translates roughly to &quot;fort&quot;. Mosques are not for prayer (though, like forts, they often have prayer spaces).<p>Right now these people in the &quot;banlieues&quot; in Paris, Bordeaux, Brussels, Rotterdam, ... are embedded into those locations and can only be dislodged by a war. They&#x27;re also looking to start a war, to dislodge everyone else. They are pushing their own people into poverty, by constantly pushing notions of muslim superiority into the kids, then throwing them into the street. Society, not even their own limited society, doesn&#x27;t agree with muslim superiority : they have no skills, they&#x27;re aggressive because of this superiority shit (the hate preachers weekly &quot;scandal&quot; doesn&#x27;t help either), and they have no respect for the law or local customs. So very few people hire them, and never into positions that would require them to be trusted. So in the real world, they are an underclass (exceptions exist of course).<p>That muslims who are taught constantly about their superiority are an underclass is according to them, of course not the result of not having any skills, and generally being aggressive morons that everybody moves away from. You see this is a vast conspiracy. Not one of the traditional western conspiracies, not a right wing conspiracy (although they&#x27;re involved), not a left wing conspiracy (although they&#x27;re involved), it&#x27;s not the Jews (although they&#x27;re REALLY involved), it&#x27;s not whites (although ...), it&#x27;s not the illuminati (although they&#x27;re involved).<p>You see, it&#x27;s a conspiracy of EVERYONE against their own little group directly.<p>The problem is that these are groups of a few hundred 15-35 year old muslims, and all they do is complain about it, maybe have a few kids, and generally hang out jobless in the street. They are useless, they have no prospects, they can&#x27;t be trained and there&#x27;s about to be millions more of them in half a decade or so.<p>A civil war in Western Europe is coming, it is a done deal. It is like a comet hitting the top of the atmosphere : not much damage yet, maybe it&#x27;s even pretty. But the explosion is coming soon no matter what anybody does, and it&#x27;ll be like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before. It is a matter of time, and nobody knows how much.",1447749950

No one is bold enough to call the emperor naked.”<p>The vulnerability in Apple Pay is in the way that it — and card issuers — “onboard” new credit cards into the system. Because Apple wanted its system to have the simplicity for which it has become famous and wanted to make the sign-up process “frictionless,” the company required little beyond basic credit card information about a user. Nor did it provide much information to the banks, like full phone numbers and addresses, that might help them detect fraud early.",1447749055

Law enforcement doesn&#x27;t understand this, they only know &quot;getting the baddies&quot;</i><p>Law enforcement doesn&#x27;t have any issues with their understanding or their clarity of thinking, but frankly I think people like us on tech forums often do.<p>Remember: one man&#x27;s terrorist is another man&#x27;s freedom fighter. The difference between &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;dissident&quot; is mostly nuanced definition, depending very much on whether the observer supports the people at question or doesn&#x27;t. People trying to overthrow the Chinese government are &#x27;dissidents&#x27; unless you&#x27;re a member of the Chinese government, in which case they&#x27;re terrorists. The fighters in eastern Ukraine are either pro-Russian rebels or anti-Ukrainian terrorists, again depending on who is talking. Islamic mullah&#x27;s are either exercising their inalienable right to freedom of speech, or spreading extremism and brainwashing people ... probably depending on whether you grew up in the USA or the UK.<p>It&#x27;s for these sorts of reasons that the UN has never been able to arrive at a working definition of terrorism.<p>So now look at the arguments deployed by the technical community for strong encryption. Privacy and encryption is important for democracy, we say, because it&#x27;s important that people be able to coordinate in order to resist an increasingly totalitarian government. It is easy to find encryption products that make this sort of argument.<p>In short, the tech community argues that strong government-proof crypto is important because dissidents must be protected (who else is both sympathetic and needs the ability for their communication to have court-order-proof levels of privacy?). But those same governments hear these arguments and say, wait, the dissidents we&#x27;re dealing with are not dissidents, they&#x27;re terrorists!<p>So this is an unresolvable conflict of views. The tech industry will unfortunately always be in the position of explicitly supporting terrorism, from at least <i>some</i> observers point of view.

The reason is that the mutations that maximise reproduction - even at the cost of the host&#x27;s life - have the advantage over less lethal pathogens. This gives it a clear short-term advantage, but of course it does not work in the long term because it runs out of hosts. And yet some of those friends insisted that this did not make sense because <i>it would not be in the best interest of a disease to maximise lethality</i>, thinking in terms of intentionality that is not present in evolution.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_asks_can_we_domesticate_germs?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_asks_can_we_domesticate...</a>",1447747438

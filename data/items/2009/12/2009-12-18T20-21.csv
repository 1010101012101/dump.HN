1003853,comment,1003519,1003519,0,0,apsurd,,,"FWIW, I'm not a big twitter user, I don't use a single twitter ""app"", but hey this is pretty cool and its extremely digestable. I'd imagine a lot of people would want that cute tree on their page, just depends on how easy it is to get it running. The concept is good though imo, good job!<p>Also the main text on the page is kind of hard to understand. It makes sense now that I saw your example page, but ""dynamic twitter theme"" didn't really do anything for me immediately. Personally I would put something like: ""Finally! Custom twitter backgrounds!"" That sounds kind of myspace-y which is a good thing imo because any idiot can use (and understand) myspace. ""pimp your twittaaaahh"" - ok just kidding about that last one.<p>So overall, your app lends itself to the ""show, don't tell"" mantra more easily than most.",1261167514

While reading something you disagree with, you will probably find yourself thinking ""Well, what about X"", and if the book doesn't explicitly address that issue you will never know what they would respond.  Even worse, people tend to assume that those who disagree with them don't have an answer to their objections, rather than that the book simply doesn't address them.  If you are instead talking to a (reasonably knowledgeable) person, they will be able to at least give some sort of answer to your objections.",1261166969

Better than ZTE Open IMHO.<p>* LG Fireweb - better specs than the ZTE Open and Alcated OT Fire but its as locked as fort knox regarding the bootloader. You will not be able to flash your own device. If that is not a problem then its a great device.<p>* Geeksphone Peak - the second highest spec.

It&#x27;s very nice to have things first-class DSLs that don&#x27;t rely on slow monad stacks, heterogeneous lists that don&#x27;t rely on existential qualification, stateful programming that isn&#x27;t a type system hack (do I really need to understand existential uninstantiated types to twiddle a bit in a vector?), first-class side-effects without monad stack weirdness (unsafe escapes don&#x27;t count), Turing-complete macros at load time, inheritance and class qualification that isn&#x27;t crippling and/or dependent on weird compiler extensions...

He donated some money to a bad cause, he refused to publicly apologise for it, so he got ousted. I&#x27;m neither for nor against that choice - I think it was up to the people at Mozilla to make their choice, and they did.<p>The details of the Github case are far more vague. We have a he-said-she-said with, apparently no evidence beyond that. And we have plenty of character witnesses in favour of Tom, who really doesn&#x27;t come across as the aggressive character that his accuser depicted him as. Finally, there is no accusation of physical violence here (otherwise there&#x27;d be evidence). It&#x27;s a poor situation, and I can see the case for Tom stepping down as well as the case for him remaining in charge. In the end, they made their choice in order to minimise the damage to Github. Seems sensible, though could really have gone either way, and the point is, we don&#x27;t know what the real deal is.<p>In this case, we have police and prosecutors basically with hard evidence of physical abuse on file, but it being rejected due to 4th amendment violations. That&#x27;s fair enough - that&#x27;s how the law should function. However, when it comes to the court of public opinion, it doesn&#x27;t matter how the evidence was seized. It is pretty incontrovertible that the guy did beat up his girlfriend for a solid chunk of time. The only plea to the contrary is in this blog post and a few tweets, all of which are just <i>so</i> wrong. I mean, he actually uses the &quot;and she&#x27;s a whore anyway&quot; approach to trying to garner sympathy. What world does this guy live in to think that that&#x27;s a useful argument?<p>So, I don&#x27;t disagree about the result of the previous two cases, though I sided with Tom in the second. What I&#x27;m saying is, if the first two, where both sides had at least some merit, resulted in the removal of said figures, and this third one, where the situation is much clearer and much harsher, did not, well, that would be a really shameful outcome.<p>Is that clearer?",1398617156

A homeless Vietnam Vet who slept on the concrete above a steam pipe for warmth.  This gentleman was almost always there when I left work for the evening, sitting on his milk crate or standing around either engaged in deep conversation with someone(s) about whatever or spouting  err.. let&#x27;s just say cat calls to women walking by.  I&#x27;d always talk to this guy after work as his stories were always entertaining, funny and typically heartfelt.<p>Last summer he received a Sony Ericsson from a catholic priest in the tenderloin and was placed on her family plan.  This was the W580 which, in its hay day, took amazing photographs.  I don&#x27;t remember how it was brought up but at some point I mentioned that he could share these pictures via the web for his adoring fans (of whom he had many) and his eyes lit up.  &quot;I&#x27;d love that, B!&quot; he told me &quot;I just don&#x27;t want to be a part of twitter or facebook or anything like that.&quot;  To which I responded that I could build a site for him.<p>I was winding down an entire rebuild of the UI for the company I work at.  I was responsible for building aspects of everything from django db models to css (SCSS really) and at home that past year I had learned how to get a basic django site hosted on my very own virtual instance.  If this guy had a smart phone the job would have been as simple as building a responsive UI and a basic django backend.<p>The challenge then became hooking now deprecated tech to the web.  After considering the problem only one solution came to mind: e-mail.  I then went to work attempting and failing to scrape gmail and wound up just installing sendmail on the same server I was serving his django instance from.  After a number of late nights and a slew of cursing I got my first end-to-end sendmail to django integration setup and from them created email addresses which acted as api endpoints.  I parsed the senders lists to ensure only my or my friends phone numbers had permission to post to the site.  I then went to work figuring out how to read, save and resize images emailed to this sendmail server.<p>By this time my friends small Ericsson had seen better days.  The man&#x27;s hands were so big that his thumb usually pressed 4-5 keys at once and I would typically see him attempting to bang out text messages or dial phone numbers with his pinky.  This is understandably frustrating AND he was working on actually cleaning up his drug and alcohol habits at the time so his phone would meet with the wall every so often.  Typically I could repair it but eventually it was damaged beyond repair.<p>From there he ended up getting a cheap go phone with no camera and he was kinda bummed but I recommended a pivot to him.  Audio posts powered by twilio.  He liked the idea so I went about consuming the twilio api and was able to get a proof of concept working fairly easily.  I had also unlocked the secrets of SSL, in order to give users a more secure login experience.  I finally got one post from him, just saying hi, but from my cell phone.  At this point I gave him a card with a number to call and access code to punch in, but he has asserted that he doesn&#x27;t want audio only posts, he wants audio and image.<p>So, I now have a sever for him running django and sendmail which work in concert only for registration (your email address needs to be white listed if you want to register and the only way to do that is to have me or my friend add your email address to the body of a text message we text to a white list email endpoint).<p>He has also since found out that his liver is essentially fucked and that he has terminal cancer which puts the idea of a website for him on the back burner for both of us.<p>So I dunno, this was essentially a CRUD type problem, and while the technical challenges weren&#x27;t as difficult as many of the ones I&#x27;ve read here, I think the creative challenge of giving a semi-tech literate homeless man a means to operate his own website with a decent amount of autonomy was a worthy and fulfilling one.  I haven&#x27;t been in this industry terribly long, but the possibilities I see out there are damn exciting.  I made no money from this work but learned a lot I didn&#x27;t already know and achieved something I feel like most people wouldn&#x27;t even attempt.  If you feel like you&#x27;re stuck in CRUD land, why not attempt to mix up your customer base a bit?  Think of something you could do that will be challenging and fun enough that you could perhaps open yourself up to an entire arena of unpaid work (I know, blasphemy!).  It might not sound glamorous.. and well.. it really isn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;ve found that the connections I can make with people using skills learned in this industry is what  really drives me.<p>So fuck it man, get CRUDDY and build some cool-ass shit for people who aren&#x27;t looking at some rigid business model.  You might find yourself seeing CRUD work in a whole new light.",1398616942

I was writing an editor for ship hulls that would allow a non-technical user to model a ship hull out of 3 sets of bezier curves - one for the side profile, one for top-down, and one for front-back. Pics at bottom.<p>The hard part was taking those 3 sets of bezier curves and turning it into a 3d mesh. There&#x27;s no pleasant mathematical way to do this directly, and there&#x27;s no way to convert the 3 sets of curves into a 2d bezier surface.<p>The eventual solution involved several steps - first the top-down curve was rasterized into points at intervals of N on the X axis (from front of hull towards back). The maximum distance between any two sets of symmetric points was used to &quot;scale&quot; the front-back view so that the endpoints of each copy of the front-back view would match each set of symmetric points on the top-down view. At this point, each set of symmetric top-down points has a matching front-back curve that connects the two points. Now each front-back curve is rasterized at intervals of I on the Y axis (from port to starboard).<p>At this point I have all the points I need and could actually rasterize them into a mesh, but with one problem - the side-view curve still isn&#x27;t accounted for. If I were to rasterize it at this point, the ship would probably look like a bullet cut in half.<p>So to take the side profile curves into consideration, the side view was rasterized like the top-down curves were, into points at intervals of N on the X axis. These points are converted into proportions (from 0 to 1) of how far they are from the top deck relative to the deepest point on the side-profile curve. Finally, each proportion was multiplied with the Z components of each point on the point-rasterized front-back curves. In this way, the side-profile just acts like a &quot;scale&quot; to how deep the front-back curves are allowed to go.<p>I was pretty happy with the results - however the mesh had densities in bad places that I later smoothed out using bicubic interpolation. I don&#x27;t have any pics of final product, but here&#x27;s some of it before the interpolation phase:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/PqX1aWL.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/PqX1aWL.png</a><p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/se9YdoO.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/se9YdoO.png</a><p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/oK4taXA.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/oK4taXA.png</a>",1398616136

When reading out the sensor the ADC would get out of sync with the shift register, resulting in adjacent pixels merging into each other or being skipped in a different pattern on each frame.  Resulted in appalling pictures.  I figured out how to re-bayer the image, then using some frequency-domain magic on a picture interpolated from the green photosites only, determined the shifting pattern in various areas of the chip. We could then automatically gain individual pixels up and down and remove the effect, resulting in a perfect image.  Went and saw the fnished film at the biggest cinema I could find and didn&#x27;t spot a single pixel wrong.

Lyft&#x27;s success so far probably hasn&#x27;t had much to do with the pre-verification (which is flimsy at best). Their success is probably driven by the fact that they&#x27;ve found a small subset of the US population who is comfortable with &quot;ride sharing&quot;. Their branding; with pink mustaches, fist bumps, riding in the front seat and a sense of &quot;community&quot; (presumably going through that ritual with another makes you part of an exclusive community), has self-selected a group of people who is comfortable with giving up some level of trust, in return for the ability to participate in their transportation marketplace.<p>That said, I think we see taxis in most cities actively avoid areas that could cause trouble. From anecdotal reports, the same isn&#x27;t true of Lyft. The implied trust (facebook verification and sense of community) likely puts those drivers in more dangerous situations more often (although it&#x27;s a group who is either comfortable with that, or hasn&#x27;t thought it through).<p>There&#x27;s also an open question as to whether or not their trust system can scale.

I&#x27;m going to assume he meant &quot;orally&quot;, because 99% of the time that is what people actually mean when they talk about verbal legal agreements.<p>It almost certainly is true. The only ways it would not be his code are if it were a &quot;work made for hire&quot; or if he has transferred the copyright to someone else.<p>There are two ways for something to be a work made for hire.<p>1. It is produced by an employee within the scope of his employment, or<p>2. It is specially ordered or commissioned and falls into one of several categories AND the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work is to be considered a work made for hire.<p>If all they have are oral agreements, then #2 is out. For #1, &quot;employee&quot; does not necessarily mean an actual employee under whatever definition your state uses for that term. It can include relationships where the person creating the work acts like an employee. A big factor in that is how the work is supervised, and who provides the equipment and facilities used in creating the work.<p>From the OP&#x27;s description, he did the work on his own. It&#x27;s hard to see how he could be seen to be an employee for purposes of copyright law, and so #1 is also out.<p>The other way he could no longer own the copyright would be if he transferred it to someone else. Copyright transfer requires a signed, written instrument. If all they have are oral agreements, then there could not have been a transfer.<p>There&#x27;s one more possibility to consider. Even thought the OP almost certainly owns the copyright on the code he has written so far, it is possible that he has licensed it to his partner. For instance, if they intended to make their code open source, and the OP included a notice stating that the code was under GPL, and gave a copy of the code and license to the partner, the partner might argue that he can continue to use that code and continue to develop it without the OP&#x27;s further permission, as long as he follows the GPL.",1398615601

Newspapers had success in the pre-Internet days, not just because of good journalism, but of good delivery systems. There&#x27;s a reason why afternoon newspapers died as television became popular (back in 1948, there were 1,453 afternoon papers versus 328 newspapers: <a href=""http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2008/02/rip-pm-newspapers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2008/02/rip-pm-newspapers.html</a>)...it&#x27;s not that people are just attracted to stellar journalism, but the newspaper is expected to provide a useful, reliable service (such as classifieds). Too many journalists thought that people paid to subscribe because they, deep inside, cared about the First Amendment and freedom of the press. Yes, some subscribers do. I pay for the New York Times and the New Yorker because I want to support them, but there&#x27;s not enough people like me around.<p>And truth be told, the New Yorker&#x27;s digital service is a pain in the ass. For awhile, their user-management system was horrible (find your print magazine, enter your name in exactly as it appears on the label) and the web-viewer is trash, and to read it on iPad meant downloading hundreds of megabytes per issue. I only use the digital service because it comes free with the print subscription and would never subscribe to digital alone. Reducing friction has been a huge factor to online subscription services in general and the news industry has been far behind on it...hopefully the Netherlands project makes up for that.<p>But even with a good subscription service, I wonder if it&#x27;s too little too late? People are now way in the habit of not paying for news. And unlike Netflix movies or Spotify tracks, the average person doesn&#x27;t get addicted to morning news clips.

The issue is that I haven&#x27;t found a way to programmatically pull the metre from a song, and rapper&#x27;s don&#x27;t generally keep track of their metre, let alone put it online in a machine readable format (though I&#x27;m sure you could find ones for hugely popular songs like &#x27;Lose Yourself&#x27; online!).<p>I am interested in figuring this out though, and have been throwing around ideas for people to simply generate metre for songs by having a tool that simply allows users to match words to times in a song. Though I&#x27;m not sure how scalable that is, or how to create such a tool that is drastically simple and fast to use, because otherwise it defeats the point. My hope is that there&#x27;d be a way to algorithmically parse the audio and look for inflection points in a song for where words might lie but I&#x27;ve done no research towards that end. digression: This kinda tech would probably be useful for generating &#x27;sing-a-longs&#x27;",1398614705

528116,comment,527706,527907,0,0,derefr,,,"Intelligence <i>is speed</i>, but not in the linear way we think of it. When people think faster, they can put slightly more time into examining each possible solution branch, which allows them to discard the ones that resolve as ""bad."" This, then, culls those branches from their memory, allowing them to process the rest of the solution tree even faster. Someone who knows a little more CS than I do could actually give a definite answer to just how much faster it makes someone, assuming, just for the sake of argument, that solution trees are binary.<p>Anyway, there are certain problems that require a ""minimum mental speed"" to accomplish; Mensa test questions are basically designed so that your working memory capacity will be exhausted by extraneous branches unless your mind can cull them as quickly as it can think of them.",1237787119

The main negative is they have a ""stay in Pennsylvania"" provision -- if you leave PA, you have to pay back the $25,000 and they keep their 3% equity.

They're all trying to pre-empt one another.

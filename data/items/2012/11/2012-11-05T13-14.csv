The key challenges for us now are:<p>- Expand to more platforms, to increase the total market we can hit.<p>- Improve the product to make it easier for the general market to understand. We are hitting early adopter types pretty well, but the majority struggle because it's a complex problem/product.<p>- Figure out how to scale the marketing (the really hard bit ;) )",1352123991

4743418,comment,4741438,4742326,2,0,electronvolt,,,"I actually made a similar observation to this in high school, and promptly used what money I could to get myself a crappy netbook.  (I also didn't really have that much disposable income back then, just what I made working retail)<p>An observation that I've made after using (a later, the first one broke) netbook with a conventional build versus the same netbook with a SSD is that with a hard drive, netbooks are painfully slow.  Once you've swapped that for a really fast SSD, and stopped using Windows on it, it boots in 10-15 seconds and programs usually launch almost-instantaneously.  I've found it to be almost as nice to use as my (much nicer and newer, quad core with a nice graphics card) desktop.  There are exceptions to the 'almost as nice':  flash doesn't work well, screen size is an annoyance sometimes, and you clearly aren't going to be doing much with CUDA.  But considering it cost ~$550 with the SSD (which was almost as expensive as the netbook), as compared to well over $1000 for the desktop+screens, it's pretty awesome (and portable, too) for someone who doesn't always have extra cash (students don't have the best salary).",1352123867

In any industry where you already have the relationships with the customers, you are already ahead of the competition. It takes hard work to foster relationships and sell well. Any dev who thinks ripping off an idea is easy money is sorely mistaken. Without marketing and potentially funding (depending on the kind of idea), it is just code sitting on a server somewhere that nobody will ever find.<p>Also, as a developer who does occasional contracts to help people build out their MVPs, it would be career-suicide to steal an idea - the last thing I would want is bad word of mouth. Entrepreneurs do sometimes cluster, attend meetups, bump into each other when pitching etc.....word gets around fast in that kind of circle.<p>And lastly, as someone who works closely with other developers on occasion, for any given idea, half of the devs I chat to don't think the idea has legs, the other half have no inclination/time to build it themselves.<p>In the end, if you are hiring someone to build it for you, chat to some developers, get a feel for them, ask for a reference or two if you don't know them well (in other words, do you due diligence) and go from there.",1352123120

Managers know that if they let their best people follow different rules, everyone will expect the same freedom.<p>High and low performance don't seem to be intrinsic to people, in the sense that mediocre people can turn excellent given the right conditions, and vice versa. What <i>does</i> seem to be intrinsic is that there are high- and low-variance people. Low variance people are reliable ladder-climbers, and high variance people are the creative ones who might have a mediocre year or two, but then have a huge breakthrough. The top performers are, for the most part, high variance individuals. High-variance people can also fail quite badly, in certain circumstances, so companies are very nervous about hiring them at all. The ""corporate ladder"" rewards reliable mediocrity, not intermittent excellence.<p>Intimidation-based management (which has been dominant since 1800) regresses performance to the mean, and its purpose is to reduce variance. When the input-output curves relating skill and effort to productivity were concave, variance-reduction was the way to go, because lower variance was equivalent to higher performance. Now that we're in a convex world (at least in software) variance-reduction fails us.",1352121812

Do you know anyone who would do something for an evening a week. Or hack on something at the weekend. Treat it more as a fun side-project, and people might be more excited about getting involved.

1) Yes, that seems to be the only way out right now. But my core features (most popular followers / most valuable followers) depend on a full set and will not be accurate. Growth data works fine though. The main reason why my service got traction were the most popular followers / most valuable followers metrics though. So that sucks. But seems to be my only resort right now.<p>2) I can get IDs faster, and then theoretically use my own DB to see if I need details for that ID (i.e. follower details) from Twitter or have them stored. Problem is: I am duplicating Twitter's database, also, I had this before and the database grew to immense size and kept crashing all the time despite efforts to avoid it. Also: Celebrities have a large distribution of followers, so unlikely to save much time by seeing who's details I already got elsewhere.<p>3. Yes, although Twitter announced their quadrants recently, of services that will be supported by them, one of them is social analytics. This is what I do. So that should be good. But you have a point, I can't touch any money for up to 1 year in case Twitter shuts it down, I want to pay back the remaining unused time to my users. So it's frozen money.",1352121171

4743256,comment,4741904,4742361,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"The core insight-- that mediocrity and failure provide about the same payoff (zero) in a modern technological economy-- is accurate.<p>Here's where the divergence happens. Being a top performer requires a lot, and not all of it's intrinsic. Fit with tools and project are important, and so are relationships. There aren't intrinsic A and B players. For example, most software projects have one or maybe two ""blazers"" who write most of the new code and make the important decisions, and many more who spend the bulk of their time keeping up. It's a lot better for your career to be in the former category; get out if you're in the latter. This is what language and tooling wars are often about in companies: people wanting to change the landscape so they can be the trailblazers and the others end up as the followers. This is why it's economically worth it (in a corporate context) to invest so much energy into tooling and language fights instead of on the work itself: if you win the battle, the leverage it applies to your work is immense. The truth is that most projects have a rank ordering that becomes self-perpetuating, because the high-ranking people take the best work and progress faster. There isn't one global equilibrium where the ""best"" people are magically matched to the best work, but N! stable equilibria, where N is the number of participants.<p>Why is this important? Well, the correct insight is that the payoff curve (between input factors and output) is now <i>convex</i>. In a concave world, you wanted to manage toward the middle: reduce variance, bring up the slackers. This is what management is good at: bringing everyone in to the middle of the performance curve. That's also why traditional management is failing in the technological world. Maximizing a concave function is equivalent to minimizing a globally convex one, which is the easiest class of optimization problems (there's one global optimum). For these, incremental evolution (gradient descent) works: you converge to an optimal solution (in economic terms, an equilibrium). It's not equipped to handle the convex world where there are zillions of possible local optima and non-local insight is required in order to find better solutions.<p>What's inaccurate is the idea that there are ""intrinsically"" mediocre vs. excellent people and that the former should just be discarded. Why do we have to stay in school until we're in our mid-20s? Because our economic contributions are worthless until we've had an amount of schooling that would be considered immense by historical standards. The reason for all this schooling is to increase the probability of a person ending up as a ""10x"" contributor in an economy that has no place for 1x contributors.<p>As for stack ranking, that's something separate, and it's actually harmful to the top performers. Stack ranking is about intimidation-- nothing else. The idea is ancient: Romans called this method of intimidation and punishment <i>decimation</i>. Split the regiment into groups of 10, of which one will die. Sometimes it was random (drawing lots) and sometimes the groups voted. The reason for the 10% cut was because (a) it's not enough of a force reduction to ""disrupt continuity"" but (b) it was large enough to scare the shit out of people. People use ""decimation"" as a synonym for ""devastation"" but that's not correct, because ""decimation"" is a controlled, small reduction of force. Stack ranking is the same concept, but with political infighting used instead of randomness to make the decisions, and the ""divide-and-conquer"" campaign it wages against the proles is intentional.<p>Intimidation's effect is performance-middling. It kills creativity and innovation, and the top performers suffer, but it brings the slackers closer to the median. Traditional, intimidation-based management worked well in a concave world where people were mostly doing low-margin commodity work and one slacker could cancel out 5 good workers, but it fails catastrophically in the convex world.",1352120965

If this is still of value to the user, it looks like the way to go, providing results based on a subset followed by another set of ""final"" results based on the full follower graph.<p>2. If you have enough celebrity-scale accounts using your service, are you able to share their followers details and cut down on time used to pull them?<p>3. On the business side, the service sounds dangerously like something that would be killed by Twitter if it becomes successful, by some definition of successful because you are pulling out their follower graphs. Look at Tumblr and Instagram. While it is good to milk it while you can and build it with ambition, it is also wise to look further and prepare for the day if it gets shut down and revenue goes to 0.

You do kind of have to figure out and fit into the culture there.<p>If a new user doesn't get it and causes problems the mods will usually politely PM them and talk to them about what's going on. If the user continues to cause problems (start fights and just generally be inflammatory to the community) they will have no problem banning them.<p>They also temp-ban users who they know are normally well behaved when they are clearly having a bad day (which usually just means that a particular thread on a particular topic hits too close to home and they just can't be civil about it).",1352120466

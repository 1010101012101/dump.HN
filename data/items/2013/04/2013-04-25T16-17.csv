In other words, the parser has information that violates the parser/compiler separation of concerns, but it works really well in practice.<p>The only time I ever use \ in Ruby is for string literals that need to be broken up for readability:<p><pre><code>    my_string = ""This is a very long string that"" \
      "" must be wrapped.""

You can use + or <<, but this will be evaluated at runtime, whereas \ results in a single string allocation.<p>Of course, Ruby requires ""end"" for a lot of constructs, but it could have just as well have used braces.",1366908974

The only way to avoid it is not to participate in such advanced P2P swarms (where nodes cache content for delivery to other nodes), since nobody knows the copyright status of a particular hash-addressable piece of content.<p>Enforcing laws in a way that bans a neutral computer technology (P2P sharing of arbitrary content) is untenable [1], regardless of the ethical, moral, and economic arguments surrounding copyright violation.<p>I see those arguments often.

But we have some ability to create the future by influencing the direction of technology, law, and cultural attitudes. And to fail to replace copyright with something else that allows people to make a living through intellectual and creative work will be a grave mistake. Just ditching copyright and embracing unfettered copying while hoping that creative people will somehow figure out how to feed their families will mean that less, much less, gets created, and we will all be poorer for it. So far, no idea has been shown to be viable: voluntary payments do not and will not work, because enough people will not pay; taking your show on the road only works for able-bodied people with certain combinations of talents, and even then only while they are young and without children - when they need a steady income the least.

The last time I saw 10Base5 (aka ""thick ethernet"", using an extra-stiff variant of RG-8 coax about 10mm thick, in continuous runs with ""vampire taps"") was sometime in the late 1980s.<p>And if the maximum cable length were simply proportional to signal propagation speed / bit rate, then why does 10Base2 have a shorter maximum length than 10Base5? They're both carrying 1e6 bits per second. Do signals really travel 3 times faster through fat coax than through thin?",1366908639

Whether it's DC or AC, it does not matter much.<p>Think of the wire as a tube with a bunch of ping-pong balls inside - filling it up tightly from start to end. If I stick my finger into one end of the tube, a ball will come out at the other end almost instantaneously (regardless of how long the tube is), but the balls themselves only moved a small distance - <i>and only at the speed/velocity I pushed my finger at</i>. But the ""signal"" ""traveled"" at a much higher velocity.<p>So in DC - electrons only travel a few centimeters / second (not anywhere near light speed), and in AC - you're pushing/pulling the same electron back and forth for eternity at about the same speed as it travels in DC.<p>Now it's of course a bit more complicated (the electrons rattle around at much greater speeds, and the mentioned velocity is a net average), and there are some edge cases, but for the most part the above is accurate.<p>I'm just not 100% sure of the speed of electrons in a superconducting loop (Cooper-pair electrons) - if they are truly relativistic or not.<p>And if this does not blow your mind, you should not be reading about electricity. PHDs in the electrical field don't even know this stuff.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity</a><p>TL;DR; If you raced a snail and an electron in a wire together, the snail would win - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbi7gJTPSXk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbi7gJTPSXk</a>",1366908580

Part of the problem is, as I've explained, our own government that didn't spread immigrants around country but allowed them to live close to one another. Now we have closed badly integrated societies (""ghettos"") in some of our bigger and even smaller cities. One city where this problem with especially the Marrocan population is very clear is Gouda, but the same kinds of problems exist in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, etc...<p>Criminality among (especially) boys of Moroccan descent is disproportionate with regards to the size of the population:<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/2624/moroccan-crime-netherlands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/2624/moroccan-crime-nether...</a><p>We've imported a lot of berber people from Morocco.

There needs to be a leading culture and people should be encouraged to adopt (parts of) the leading culture or blend it with their own culture. Without a leading culture the social cohesion slowly erodes. And this is why I think Switzerland made a very wise decision in limiting immigration.

These <i>are</i> company/marketing/publicity accounts anyway (I'm assuming). It's not like followgen is masquerading around with a stolen identity like most follow bots, spitting out bit.ly spam with suggestive tweets and racy pictures. It's simply programmatically allowing twitter accounts to reach out to people who happen to fall into a statistical category. It's also important to remember that follow bots make it easy to follow-back via the ""follow"" link in notification emails. On an iPhone, to follow the account of someone who favorites my tweet I would 1) see the notification, 2) open the app, 3) select the interaction 4) select the user 5) follow the user (I count 3 interactions using the web app, already having the page loaded). If it truly is spam I can just ignore the notification, as opposed to having to block and report a follow bot.<p>Rather ingenious, if I do say so myself. The favorite interaction has become increasingly important over the past year or so... I know friends (non-technical friends) who joined twitter recently who would rather get a favorite than a retweet, as a favorite feels more personal. This opposed to a retweet, which seem to be given out much more frequently than a year ago. It would also be pretty cool to be favorited by a recognizable name.

Rust has three types of pointers, and needs a line-noise character for each of them. That, combined with the liberal use of underscore-based identifier names, makes it very noisy. (Ruby also uses underscore-based names, but the relative absence of noise characters keeps it clean.)<p>In my opinion any new language project ought to have an overriding aesthetics process.

Trying to teach others forces you to learn your subject even better than you already know it.  Additionally, the questions and counter-points and feedback you get from students / people you're mentoring /etc. will expose you to new ideas and new ways of thinking, which you can then integrate and synthesize around.<p>I don't know if I'd be able to do much ""one on one"" mentoring, as time is awfully limited right now.  But I have a lecture/class or two in mind that I'll probably offer to teach somewhere in the RTP area later this year.  I have learned enough about market research to do a useful one or two night session on the topic.<p>No, I'm not an expert on it, but what I've learned in the past 2 years would possibly be beneficial to the people who are now, where I was two years ago.  I figure if I can help shorten someone else's learning curve, that's a good thing.  And, inevitably, if I do the class, I'll learn a lot from the process itself.<p>So yeah, if you have some useful knowledge you've accumulated (and you probably do) teach a class, or take on a pupil to mentor.

That said, there are a few really good fully-passive, high-output MR16s on the market.<p>I believe switching capacitors in the power supply are what limit the lifetime of most LED bulbs - electrolytic caps being one of the worst offenders. Good thermal management helps mitigate these problems, but a lot of failures are chemical in nature - caused by the degradation of the capacitor's electrolyte. This is why we've all seen the capacitor choice in motherboards and PSUs used as a marketing item.<p>Full disclosure: I used to work for a well-known LED lighting company, but please take the above with a grain of salt as I am not an electrical engineer.

I quit your service in March and I hope you solved these issues by now. I was annoyed about the fact that the stats stopped to be shown to me after a month. I was just receiving money without knowing what clicks or impressions I had for the banners placed on my sites. Another thing that I disliked was that in the last month of partnership, there was only one advertiser in my banner cycle which meant that the variety of banners was low, leading to a decreasing number of clicks. I surely hope that by now you contacted more advertisers. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying these things to give you bad publicity, instead I'm hoping that you solved/are solving these problems so that me along with other publishers will use your service again. For the moment, I'm using Adsense and I'm receiving more money than from influAds.",1366905745

- He's ""pretty sure"" (direct quote) that they offered to take down reviews.  Hardly a smoking gun.
- He doesn't agree with the reviews of his business.  No surprises there.
- There's an article in a newspaper where a bunch of business owners claimed Yelp punished them for not advertising. 
- I think he even implies that Yelp's PR people being scared about that article is somehow evidence of it being true...which is borderline funny.<p>I trust my heroes too, but like, that blog post doesn't really...say anything.",1366905637

I don't see why not; there's basically no way for anyone to verify whether Yelp does this unless they get to dive into emails for discovery in a big trial. Then again, I have to think Yelp has enough integrity not to mess with results; but my point is you would never know except through hearsay and gossip.<p>There's no ChillingEffects for Yelp Reviews.",1366905628

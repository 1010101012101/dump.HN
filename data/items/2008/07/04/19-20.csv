I've worked in several smallish companies (circa 500 employees), where I was the only person in IT who had a computing-related degree.  Furthermore, I was the only one who had any interest in IT per se, and the only one who had any knowledge of IT beyond what was required to do the job (even in that knowledge some of them were woefully ignorant).

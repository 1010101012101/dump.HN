(It was the pre-ribbon Office.  2005?)  The reality was all the knowledge the employees had (not to mention their shitty macros) didn't transfer to the new version, so we simply did not upgrade.<p>The reason new laptops ship with a new version of Windows rather than Ubuntu is because people are used to fighting changes in their software, but they'll notice that they don't have ""the real thing"" when they buy a $13 Windows-only LED keychain charger and it doesn't work when they plug it in to their computer.  Then they'll complain to their computer's OEM, and Microsoft will laugh evilly.  (I don't really understand it.  The amount of hardware I never got to work in Windows is approximately the same as the amount of hardware I never got to work under Linux.)",1339984785

How about because it's far easier to use and less fiddly than Linux? How about because the software selection is vastly superior to both Linux and OS X? How about because almost any computer (including Apple's) can run Windows AND all your hardware will work just fine with it, while if you want to run OS X, you'll have to buy an expensive machine from Apple, and if you want to run Linux, you better pray there's decent driver support for your peripherals.<p>The situation has gotten a lot better over the last decade for OS X and Linux users (though Windows has also improved a lot), but we're a FAR cry from a world in which the only valid reason to use Windows is momentum.<p>I won't even bother trying to list all the reasons to use Word and Excel (<i>especially</i> Excel) over Libre and Google Docs.

So it stands to reason that if you can get people used to paying for individual online services (like they do for HBO on their cable), then it is not required that things be ad supported anymore.<p>I think the reason things are ad supported is because making money from advertising is really simply.  You need one person at your organization to call an advertiser, and a day of his work can give you millions in instant cash.  Customers, on the other hand, require a lot more maintenance and generate less money per individual, so scaling up a business based on customers paying money is very difficult.   (Even Microsoft, a huge company that sells software, prefers to get OEMs to buy you a Windows license.  One deal with one OEM equals millions of dollars.  One deal with you equals $39.)",1339984392

4124500,comment,4123863,4124305,6,0,vilhelm_s,,,"Note that bottom is a theoretical concept. If you actually evaluate (1/0) in the haskell interpreter, you get an error message<p><pre><code>   *** Exception: Ratio.%: zero denominator\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, if you run an infinite loop in the interpreter, it just loops forever. (Well, in certain special cases it can figure that out and throw an exception). The implementation never creates an actual ""bottom"" value that has to be handled by e.g. arithmetic operators.<p>The issue of bottom comes up when you try to define precisely what the meaning of a program is (in the jargon, when you give a denotational semantic). It is clear that the expression (1+1) should ""mean"" 2, but what is the meaning of an infinite loop? Answer: a special ""error value"" which we call bottom.<p>You may wonder why most traditional mathematics doesn't make a fuss about bottom values, and just get away with saying ""this is a partial function"". This is because most everyday mathematical functions are defined by e.g. simple structural recursion, so issues of termination are seldom very complicated.

There is no ""postmodernist movement"". The term refers to a hopelessly large field of practices. Most great so-called ""postmodernist"" theorists typically have not referred to themselves as such.<p>If you want to discredit theorists who have been critical of scientific practices, you need to put down the Sokal and actually engage with specific works. You might be surprised to find that many of these ""postmodernists"" are either trained scientists or actually know what they're talking about. Just a few suggestions if you want to dip your toes in the water:<p> Gilles Deleuze wrote powerfully on metaphysics, integrating many incites from mathematics in the 60's and 70's: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleuze#Metaphysics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleuze#Metaphysics</a> Check out ""Difference and Repetition"".<p> Alain Badiou uses set theory in his ontology: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Badiou#Mathematics_as_ontology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Badiou#Mathematics_as_ont...</a>  I find his ontology lacking though; he should learn something from the failings of set theory in the early 20th century.<p> Bruno Latour in a the domain of Science and Technology Studies has written voluminously about scientific and technological practices from a more anthropological point of view: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour#Biography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour#Biography</a><p> Isabelle Stengers has written something more along the lines of what's critiqued in this article, a critique of the <i>authority</i> of science in society: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cosmopolitics-I-Posthumanities-Isabelle-Stengers/dp/0816656878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cosmopolitics-I-Posthumanities-Isabell...</a>  works like this question whether the privileging of science over all other forms of knowledge is good for society. This particular work argues that it is not.<p> Mike Cooley argues powerfully that the deskilling of the engineering industry caused by computer-aided design and manufacturing is a travesty: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Architect-Bee-Human-Technology-Relationship/dp/0896081311"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Architect-Bee-Human-Technology-Relatio...</a><p>A general note about so-called ""postmodernism"". The Wikipedia definition includes the following:<p>""Postmodernism is largely a reaction to the assumed certainty of scientific or objective efforts to explain reality. In essence, it is based on the position that reality is not mirrored in human understanding of it, but is rather constructed as the mind tries to understand its own personal reality.""<p>It's important to understand that ""postmodernism"" isn't critiquing the effectiveness of science. It is merely claiming that, as it says, reality is not mirrored in human understanding. The models we create to explain observed phenomena are not direct reflections of reality, they are simply characteristically human, linguistic models that correspond to our observations. As Niels Bohr wrote:<p>""There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature...""<p>The question is whether our habit of elevating scientific explanation to the 'one true truth' is (1) right and (2) a good thing. Most ""postmodernists"" argue that other forms of knowledge are perfectly legitimate (for instance, indigenous people who still live tribally lead perfectly happy lives without science) and that the privileging of science over other forms of knowledge is not a unilaterally good thing (for instance, it is reasonable to say there's a decent change that we will extinguish ourselves as a species in the next hundred years thanks to the exploits of scientifically advanced societies).<p>You may notice that both of those examples are anthropological. This hints at something very important about ""postmodernism"". When people talk about ""postmodernism"", they're often talking about ""post-structuralism"", which is another hopelessly broad category referring to theory that in some way extends ""structuralism"", which is in turn closely connected to the theories of Claude Lvi-Strauss, the ""father of modern anthropology"". ""Postmodernism"" can be seen in this sense to be a kind of anthropologically informed philosophy. Rather than creating theoretically sound abstract models, they look at how those models actually play out ""in the field"" and draw conclusions. Hence the critique of science: despite the power of scientific explanation, it may not necessarily result in a better society and indeed the <i>evidence</i> shows that it does not.<p>And one final point, the author is totally wrong to claim that scientists have not been concerned with the philosophy of science. Many early twentieth century scientists  the ones who create the theory of relatively and quantum physics especially  even wrote books on the philosophy of science as well as its role in society.

So probably no IPv6 and GPT. Also, the older devices support only ext3 not ext4.<p>I found out last year that my particular NAS was due for a recall on the power supply. Unfortunately, this recall had been issued several years earlier and I just had not noticed it. TL:DR, ReadyNAS replaced it gratis even though the recall notice had expired several years prior.<p>Other than what I listed above, I can wholeheartedly recommend the ReadyNAS.

Two Utility substations that feed the impacted Availability Zone went offline, causing the entire Availability Zone to fail over to generator power. All EC2 instances and EBS volumes successfully transferred to back-up generator power.   At 8:53PM PDT, one of the generators overheated and powered off because of a defective cooling fan.  At this point, the EC2 instances and EBS volumes supported by this generator failed over to their secondary back-up power (which is provided by a completely separate power distribution circuit complete with additional generator capacity).  Unfortunately, one of the breakers on this particular back-up power distribution circuit was incorrectly configured to open at too low a power threshold and opened when the load transferred to this circuit.  After this circuit breaker opened at 8:57PM PDT, the affected instances and volumes were left without primary, back-up, or secondary back-up power.  Those customers with affected instances or volumes that were running in multi-Availability Zone configurations avoided meaningful disruption to their applications; however, those affected who were only running in this Availability Zone, had to wait until the power was restored to be fully functional.<p>The generator fan was fixed and the generator was restarted at 10:19PM PDT.  Once power was restored, affected instances and volumes began to recover, with the majority of instances recovering by 10:50PM PDT.  For EBS volumes (including boot volumes) that had inflight writes at the time of the power loss, those volumes had the potential to be in an inconsistent state.  Rather than return those volumes in a potentially inconsistent state, EBS brings them back online in an impaired state where all I/O on the volume is paused.  Customers can then verify the volume is consistent and resume using it.  By 1:05AM PDT, over 99% of affected volumes had been returned to customers with a state 'impaired' and paused I/O to the instance.<p>Separate from the impact to the instances and volumes, the EBS-related EC2 API calls were impaired from 8:57PM PDT until 10:40PM PDT.  Specifically, during this time period, mutable EBS calls (e.g. create, delete) were failing.  This also affected the ability for customers to launch new EBS-backed EC2 instances.  The EC2 and EBS APIs are implemented on multi-Availability Zone replicated datastores. The EBS datastore is used to store metadata for resources such as volumes and snapshots.  One of the primary EBS datastores lost power because of the event.    The datastore that lost power did not fail cleanly, leaving the system unable to flip the datastore to its replicas in another Availability Zone.  To protect against datastore corruption, the system automatically flipped to read-only mode until power was restored to the affected Availability Zone.  Once power was restored, we were able to get back into a consistent state and returned the datastore to read-write mode, which enabled the mutable EBS calls to succeed.  We will be implementing changes to our replication to ensure that our datastores are not able to get into the state that prevented rapid failover.<p>Utility power has since been restored and all instances and volumes are now running with full power redundancy.  We have also completed an audit of all our back-up power distribution circuits.  We found one additional breaker that needed corrective action.  We've now validated that all breakers worldwide are properly configured, and are incorporating these configuration checks into our regular testing and audit processes.<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience to those who were impacted by the event.</i>",1339984111

Partly because it's less lines, but partly because those lines are more meaningful and less bland.  It would be hard to see a typo in the repetitive inner loop of the first version.<p>- Two obvious independent pieces of code instead of one big piece of code.  That means if you're reading it, you know how to go about understanding it; understand each piece in turn.  Somewhat trivial when there are 25 lines, but serious if there are 200 lines.<p>- Easier to test and debug.  At a REPL, it's trivial to see what the stack is going to look like five hops into the functional version; you just apply the processing function five times.  To do the same to the imperative version, you need to either write some debug logic into the middle of the function or set a breakpoint and hit 'continue' in your debugger while you count on your fingers.<p>Those reasons are typical consequences of writing your code as a collection of data and pure functions.<p>Also, the semantics are <i>not</i> completely inherently serial for most possible stacks.  The sequence of operations forms a tree of computation, and the branches of the tree could be computed in parallel.  If you actually wanted to do that (say, if the operations took a long time individually) then the way you would go about it is to construct the tree explicitly up front, take this functional version, replace fold with a version of fold that knows how to fold over trees in parallel, and fold it over the tree.

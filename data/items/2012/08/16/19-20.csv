These are essentially blacklists for the payment card industry that all acquiring banks and processors check new applications against.<p>The reason the risk is not lessened is that when a merchant is added to these lists, both the company and all the company's principals' names and social security numbers are added. The list of a company's principals is something merchant account providers ask for on new account applications for this reason.<p>Basically, if you do something so egregious as to be added to these lists, you'll never be able to have an ownership stake in any business accepting credit cards for the rest of your life.

So, the most you're processing is a quarter million/year, and you're paying 275/month = 3300 per year. $3300/$250000 means you're paying an effective processing fee of 1.32%. That's a big savings over their usual 2.75%, but it's still probably more than the big players are paying. And that's assuming that you use it for optimal efficiency. \nThe breakeven point is ($3300 / .0275) = $120,000, which is reasonable, all things considered - I know a couple of small shops that do ~$200,000/year of business.

Ill discuss two of them. The first problem with it is that BIG cannot be accurately characterized as something for nothing. All societies impose many rules on every individual. Consider the discussion of homelessness above. Why cant homeless people build their own shelter and their own latrine? Why cant they drink out of a clean river? Why cant they hunt, gather, or plant and harvest their own food? They cannot do these things because the state has made rules saying they dont have the right to do these things. The state has imposed rules saying that almost all the resources of the Earth belong to someone else. Those of us who benefit from the rules by which our society distributes ownership of the Earths natural resources benefit every day from the states interference with the propertyless, and we pay them no compensation. A state without BIG is the state that has something for nothing.<p>BIG is (and should be seen) not as something for nothing but as the just compensation for all the rules of property and property regulations society imposes on individuals.""",1345146605

This would also be much faster than masking the layer, as it'd create four small GPU-accelerated blend areas rather than one giant offscreen view to upload every frame.

Now, whether you make the corners rounded or not, that's just an extra design detail. But the way to achieve unbounded content is to just make your app full screen. Drop the fixed navigation along the bottom, put it in a hidden sidebar.<p>Now this is great, but it's not a magic bullet. What the article didn't say is, there are usability concerns with this too -- if you don't have a lot of navigation, having to show the sidebar is just going to be an extra step for the user.<p>Of course, if you can keep your entire app in one screen without the user needing to scroll <i>anything</i>, that's ideal.",1345146084

It should be regarded as a crime worthy of prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and right now it isn't.<p>If people in the armed forces were killed by their fellow soldiers at the rate women in the armed forces are assaulted and/or raped (which would mean a Fort Hood massacre every _week_), it would get a lot of attention, and the perpetrators would actually be prosecuted instead of shielded from consequence. But when a victim of assault reports it in the military, the consequences usually fall on the victim and the perp gets to walk. I think any rational human would find that sickening.<p>I also take umbrage with your sugarcoated characterization of rape as ""involuntary sexual intercourse,"" as if it could happen by accident. There is no such thing as ""involuntary"" sexual intercourse. Sex requires consent. If consent is not given or is revoked, it immediately becomes assault and/or rape, and the person who disregards that becomes an assailant and/or rapist. Your use of dismissive, diminishing rhetoric to describe (or even excuse) the traumatizing act of sexual assault/rape is a lame and misguided attempt of political correctness of your own preference. Which is a nice way of saying that you're propping up rape culture.<p>I don't know you, but based on your comments you seem to have very little to no empathy for victims of assault.

4393098,comment,4391277,4391720,3,0,ericdykstra,,,"I am not a financial consultant, but some general guidelines for retirement investing that anyone can follow with minimal effort. This is only applicable if you believe that the world economic growth rate in publicly traded markets is growing at a rate greater than the safest investments (close to nothing as of late):<p>- Invest first in employer-matching 401K. Even if the fund choices aren't 100% ideal, they're almost never <i>awful</i>, and you're getting free money. Invest second in IRA/Roth IRA, the choice won't make a huge deal of difference to most people, but do your own research to see what's best for your situation. If your employer doesn't match for 401K, fill that up after your IRA. The reason for all of this: tax benefits. If you still have money left over after these limits for your retirement plan, it probably is time to consult a financial professional.<p>- If you're using your employers' 401K, and the options are limited, choose the one that reaches the most diversity (type of asset, all types of market caps of companies, and definitely with global reach). I'd stay away from money market funds (with such a small rate of return, I feel it's a waste of your tax-haven dollars), and focus on equity, real estate, and a smaller amount of government bonds. The reason for diversifying is that the more types of asset categories you are in, and the more diverse the assets inside of each of those categories, the less unnecessary risk you take on.<p>- If you're choosing assets for your IRA, follow the same sort of guidelines. The easiest way to do this is to use ETFs, which track various markets. A very simple example ETF IRA portfolio might look something like this: 30% in a NYSE tracking ETF, 20% in a NASDAQ tracking ETF, 40% in a ""non-us market"" tracking ETF, 10% in a real-estate ETF. If you want to diversify with precious metal assets or bond assets, feel free to mix in whatever share you like, or make those investments outside of the IRA (if you've filled your IRA quota already).<p>This is a simple guide that anyone can set up in a couple of hours, and maintain with a half hour or so per month. It's less risky and more financially sound than ""picking stocks"", and will very likely not be a loser by the time you retire unless the worldwide economy is, overall, a loser between now and the time you retire.<p>The content of this post is for general information purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.",1345144286

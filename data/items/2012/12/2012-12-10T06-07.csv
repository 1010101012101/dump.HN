Rather, I find it somewhat patronising--it dismisses Peter's blog post as not specific enough by focusing on the question of content rather than tone.<p>The blog post was an exhortation to open our minds, to be more constructive with our peers and more creative as a community; I found it unfortunate that Patrick seemed to dismiss Peter's input by making that sort of detour in his comment. I probably would have ignored it except that <i>the entire point of the blog post</i> was to try being a bit less rigid with each other.<p>I didn't mean for my comment to become a ""scrutinise Patrick"" thread--it was just a comment.",1355122788

Although there's less current going through that solder, it's so much more thermally conductive it'll probably see its temperature increasing faster than that of the copper.<p>That certainly doesn't help when solder's melting point tends to be around 140C and copper's is 1000C.

4897810,comment,4895710,4897766,7,0,nostrademons,,,"A lot of this depends upon your attitude toward abstraction.  For example, there's a Python idiom for flattening a list that is just sum(list, []), taking advantage of the overloaded + for lists.  (This is considered bad style for Python; use itertools.chain instead).<p>However, if you're a Haskeller (or a mathematician), this makes perfect sense.  Any type with an associative binary + and an identity element is a monoid; any additive monad (MonadPlus in Haskell) is a monoid; List is a monad; therefore it makes perfect sense that operations like ""sum"" that are defined on monoids should work on lists.<p>This is just the age old abstraction vs. traceability debate that's been going on in programming languages for 40 years.  Die-hard C programmers look at Java code that says a.dot(b) and say ""How can I possibly know what this does?  It depends upon the run-time type of a.  Much safer just to do vector_add(a, b).""  Then Java programmers look at Python code that says a.dot(b) and say ""How can I possibly know what this does?  I don't even know what interface a and b have to conform to, they could be anything.""  Then Python programmers look at Haskell code that says a * b and say ""How can I possibly know what this does?  You say it depends upon the <i>type</i> of a and b, and it could be either a dot or a cross product?  And what's this -XOverlappingInstances flag I need to know about?""<p>Somewhere, there's a happy middle ground between impenetrable code vs. rewriting the same thing over and over again for different types.  Personally, I think you won't find it with a blanket rule like ""never use operator overloading"", and it depends a lot on which abstractions come up in your problem domain.",1355120608

This will slow down brute force attempts to the point where they're useless, while still allowing legitimate users to login (just with a little inconvenience).<p>As a result, if I failed three attempts with one account, and three one next, etc., my IP-level limit will prohibit me from moving on to other accounts. If I try a lot of passwords on one account, the account-level and IP-level ones will slow me down.

The basics have already been invented for other reasons (internal combustion engine, battery, electric motor, etc) so any sort of car should work fine aside from the infrastructure (power distribution, roads).  Which sort is best depends on e.g. whether there's cheap oil (there might be if we hadn't used so much oil already) and what people are using cars for (people would be used to another mode with different capabilities; I've read that humans regardless of transit mode tend to prefer about an hour commuting per day and the distance of an hour depends on the prevalent mode).  Random thoughts follow:<p>If the automobile were invented in 2013, we wouldn't have range anxiety, because we'd be used to getting around on horses.  (Without range anxiety, electric cars might be the cheapest.)  Or we would have range anxiety if there were lots of functioning places that would exchange your horse for one that wasn't tired (and no car recharging/refueling stations, of course).<p>Or maybe trains would still be the way everyone gets around.  The streetcar would be ubiquitous, and would be the only reason we'd have quality roads (with rails in them).  The streetcars might run on electricity or natural gas, judging by modern bus and light rail.  Bicycles might be popular, and suburbs would have developed around streetcar lines rather than along interstate highways (I'm US-centric).<p>Cars might not need charging/fueling stations, if they could piggyback on an extensive electrical streetcar network's power lines.  Then they would probably be electrical and have battery for short off-network trips.<p>The probable lack of a good road network is going to be a problem.  We'll have to design a car that's good off-road.  Preferably we will avoid annoying bicyclists by wearing away their dirt roads (if bicycling is in style and horses aren't); but we'll fail, because just having an enclosure for a person (I assume an enclosure is necessary to count it as a ""car"") is pretty heavy, and we can't improve wheels/tires terribly much.<p>Which parts and energy sources would be cheap?  David Archer's _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_ (2007 edition, p.101) tells me that about 2/3 of US oil use is in transportation.  The world might not have as much oil production capacity if the car hadn't existed (thus higher prices; then again, a newly invented car wouldn't suddenly be used by everyone, so oil production could ramp up over time along with demand); or the world might still have lots of easily extractable oil (lower prices).<p>Who would buy/use this car: rich? middle class? People who already travel a lot? People who are content?  Individuals?  Businesses?  Transit companies (along the lines of ZipCar or self-driving cars)?  Taxi drivers (there would probably be taxis powered by horse, bicycle, or some sort of engine)?  How would people learn to drive this car?  Probably most people wouldn't be used to operating a dangerous piece of machinery, and there wouldn't be laws regulating it (or there would be strict industry-focused laws).<p>The lack of experienced drivers suggests self-driving cars are a good idea; but the lack of well-marked roads means our AI tech needs to be a bit further ahead and we might have to wait 5 years.<p>EDIT: crossposted this response to my blog, since why not <a href=""http://idupree.dreamwidth.org/2568.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://idupree.dreamwidth.org/2568.html</a>",1355119623

Accept that you've done something wrong (even if you didn't realize it at the time), figure out what you could have done to prevent it, and then get over it.  Life's too short to play the blame game, even with yourself.",1355119260

I know more about them from practical encounters that happen around than you can know about by reading.<p>But as I said for a guy suffering from chronic illness, who is told <i>Hey nothing is wrong with you, and its all in your head</i>, who would probably die otherwise- will rather take his chances with homeopathy or Ayurveda than sit at home and think about hundred reasons why science says otherwise. And wait for the disease to slowly kill him, while allopathy offers him no cure and only costly tests and hospital stay in return.<p>Heck, these system of medicines are one thing. I've even met exorcists around here. I know people who go to these people and come out sane. You can sit down and write a hundred reasons why that shouldn't work. But a person from village side in India or any other poor guy, with hardly enough money to feed his family is not likely to visit a hospital like NIMHANS in Bangalore and spend months with tests and hospital with no cure in sight. He will go to what gives him the quickest and cheapest cure.<p>Its difficult to explain to you because you have never been in a situation where anything and everything you will or can do can't get you out of it.  Watching yourself in such misery and realizing the helplessness of your actions. That is when you start looking for miracles. Until you actually face that, anything that I say will attract a justification from you.<p>I sincerely hope you never get caught in such a situation, because let me tell you its a humbling experience when you learn such things the hard way.",1355119236

(Authentication and Access Control) and make it get used everywhere.<p>Hell, Google can't even work out what to <i>name</i> things. So you get scammers exploiting Google.com naming to convince marks that the scammer really works for Google. This is also a Platform issue - Google.com should be for Google stuff - not abusable to allow, for example, spoofing a search results page so you can claim that Google has given you special access to modify search results (one SEO scam that I keep encountering). Non-Google stuff should be on an identifiable domain, which will eventually permeate user consciousness as being ""not Google content"".<p>I speak as a pure outsider and consumer of Google stuff.

I was an AdWords Help Forum Top Contributor until Google decided that small businesses should only receive AdWords support from other users, not Google. That's seriously annoying. I stopped contributing when it became clear that Google thought small businesses should be denied any customer service - you really can't have third parties answering questions about why Google isn't accepting a specific credit card, or even why a specific disapproval has been given in an account you can't see. That was pure arrogance - dumping on volunteers and crapping on small businesses.

The young, university educated people I hang out with all work more then 40 hours and take about 20 vacation days and work 40-60 hours, more if necessary.<p>However I think direct comparison is pretty hard. What does count towards the total amount worked? For example including social drinks in their total biasing the amount upwards.",1318496757

Given the tremendous successes and wealth some people have created for themselves, the average working person is essentially just a few steps above zero.  I know a few millionaires, but I don't know anyone who is personally in debt millions of dollars (although I'm sure they exist) with no hope/skills/connection to make money again, as they obviously had something going on to get in that position in the first place.
There is a quote by Donald Trump, something about how during one of his darker moments in his business life, he walked by a homeless guy on the street, and thought ""that guy is worth a billion dollars more than I am"".  Obviously that is true on paper, but the homeless guy also did not have the resources to get their in the first place, much less make it back and become successful.",1318496514

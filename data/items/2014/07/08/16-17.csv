I am convinced there is lots of room in this space for services that cater to people who aren&#x27;t quite in the Bloomberg terminal crowd, and yet would benefit from easy access to financial data for whatever reason. I&#x27;ve been working on a service to open up EDGAR data to more people: www.easyedgar.com (pre-launch).

8005454,comment,8002194,8004701,1,0,alkonaut,,,"> Well while we don&#x27;t need to state reasons, there is also the risk that all proprietary software is less productive for some reason.<p>Only from simple empirical studies of a few software packages (OO vs MS Office, Gimp vs PS, Eclipse vs IDEA, Blender vs. many) I think it&#x27;s fairly obvious that the &quot;normal&quot; open source model doesn&#x27;t match the megacorp development model for complex desktop software. My best guess at the reason is that 1) Ivory Tower is better than committee design for user interfaces 2) you need a LOT of expensive non dev resources such as designers and focus groups which just don&#x27;t seem to materialize for the open source projects like they do when Adobe or Microsoft waves a pay check.<p>I think there may be lots to save in administration, servers etc when moving to Linux, but 2014 isn&#x27;t the year of desktop Linux, far from it. You really can&#x27;t motivate not buying office for a few bucks per month and expect to save money.<p>You CAN probably save a ton by ditching exchange/SQL server and so on, where there are plenty of good alternatives.

8005453,comment,8004783,8004783,3,0,tokenadult,,,"The article reports:<p>&quot;Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK, described the study as a &#x27;technical tour de force&#x27;.<p>&quot;However, he warned the current accuracy levels risked telling healthy people they were on course to develop Alzheimer&#x27;s which may lead to anxiety and depression.&quot;<p>I just completed the Coursera online course in human behavior genetics. One of the ways that psychology research can contribute to the hoped-for future of genomic, personalized medicine is by figuring out how patients will react to various kinds of personal medical information about possible future outcomes. Today, there are some genetic tests for Mendelian (single-mutation) diseases that have a very high reliability, but many patients don&#x27;t seek those tests, even if they have relatives who had the diseases, because there isn&#x27;t much a patient can do about an incurable disease. People DON&#x27;T want to know that they are sure to die with a grave disease in the next twenty years. People would rather imagine that they just might live forever.<p>So if other studies replicate the result of the study reported here, and perhaps even further refine the accuracy of predicting Alzheimer disease risk from a simple blood test taken earlier in life, there will still be plenty of research to do on how to motivate patient behavior in<p>a) seeking the test,<p>b) acting on the results of the test in a rational way,<p>and<p>c) not piling up other health risks meanwhile.<p>And of course if this study finding eventually translates through further research into a deeper understanding of the cause of Alzheimer disease, leading to a prevention strategy or even a cure for that disease, that would be wonderful, but there are plenty of diseases that can be reliably diagnosed without being treatable or even preventable at all. This is a good step forward, but much work remains to be done to tackle Alzheimer disease and further prolong healthy lifespan for the patients at risk for that disease.",1404838557

There can only be one cgroups manager on the system. cgmanager isn&#x27;t finished, either.<p>>As an example, Gnome now uses parts of systemd for session management (replacing consoleskit, and others). While there are workarounds, this means no one can really use any other init system besides systemd, or things won&#x27;t work correctly.<p>Gnome requires logind, which is the successor to consolekit. Gnome has repeatedly stated that they&#x27;re willing to work with the BSDs et al with workarounds. You can either use the old logind, which doesn&#x27;t require systemd as PID1 (due to cgroups management changes) or you can develop your own replacement to logind, one that doesn&#x27;t require systemd as PID1.<p>People criticize these decisions, but they have no suggestions on how to fix it and, for the most part, they have no inkling of why there&#x27;s a requirement.",1404838526

I&#x27;m not a supporter of one-process-per-container philosophy, but even 3 processes/services inside a container are easier to manage than a full VM.<p>> not to mention lug around a 600+mb base OS image and update it<p>Last I checked the base Ubuntu image was ~120Mb.<p>> I am not sure how Docker handles keeping images updated<p>You just rebuild them. Thanks to Dockerfiles it&#x27;s fully automated, so you can plug it into your CI.<p>The whole point of Docker containers is that they are very easy and cheap to build, run, share and destroy. Personally, I use Docker as a replacement for VirtualBox - my containers are nearly-full-OSes, with sshd, cron, syslog etc. running on them. But building a new one for a new project - if the project doesn&#x27;t need something exotic like different distro - takes tens of seconds at most and starting/running a new instance (which is equivalent of starting VirtualBox image) takes a few seconds at most.<p>The important thing to remember about Docker is that you can have as little or as much of an OS inside of a container as you want. The only thing shared between the container and native OS is the kernel - inside the container you can install any distro you want or even get by <i>without</i> any explicit distro (although I don&#x27;t know if someone tried this yet). You can have a full-fledged OS if you really need it - you can run the container, ssh on it and configure everything you need to. Or you can just run a single process inside a container. Or you can stay in the middle. Whatever you do, Docker gracefully adapts, unlike a VM, which will always need heaps of RAM, have problems with interop and so on.<p>Over in *BSD land they have jails - I&#x27;ve been using them for years before Docker existed - and they are really proven piece of technology. One interesting use case for them is in PC-BSD, which is FreeBSD-derived desktop system. There&#x27;s this nifty &quot;wizard-like&quot; GUI for spinning up jails for installing packages from outside the official package manager (like from sources or ports). The system takes care of tunneling, symlinking userland and so on; you can install/build/compile three different versions of Firefox in their respective jails and run them seamlessly alongside each other on your native desktop. It&#x27;s just one of the possibilities this technology - I mean very cheap kernel-level virtualization - can be used for.",1404838057

Particularly, nothing stops labor suppliers that you are purchasing from from trying to sell their labor directly and from abandoning your service when they succeed in doing so.<p>There&#x27;s actually quite a lot of law (starting with -- and largely tieing into -- the prohibition of slavery, but this also includes things like limitations on non-compete agreements, restriction on requiring specific performance in contracts, etc.) that limits the ability of capital owners to invest in &quot;human labor&quot;, other than <i>their own</i>, as an asset -- as that amounts to <i>owning other people</i> (or, at least, their ability to produce economically-valuable output, which largely amounts to the same thing.)",1404835640

I think of databases as one of the bright spots in computing. They are very closely related to real business needs, and do a good job for the most part.<p>MS Access was great because it also had a form builder and it could all work over a network[1]. That means you could get a small business organized around a database easily and incrementally.<p>Now, we have to actually program to make that happen (e.g. rails, django, etc.) and design the forms with text rather than graphically. That&#x27;s a big step backward for the technical non-programmers (e.g. accountants, HR professionals, etc.).<p>Of course, I&#x27;m always willing to hear new ideas. If you think you have the answer, please share (and/or start a startup).<p>Disclaimer: I have been heavily involved with databases from many perspectives (user, application developer, DBA, internals hacker). So, it&#x27;s not a surprise that I think databases are great.<p>[1] Yes, the networking was a disaster from a technical standpoint.

It&#x27;s funny because the &quot;y-meter&quot; is at the same time the thing that interests me the most & the thing that I find the most inscrutable.<p>* The scaling feels off. Half the box means 51 points and the whole box means 401? In eighths, the transitions go {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} which just makes my head ache.<p>* When you have crummy eyes some of the transitions are hard: [51,100] looks too close to [101,200] and [201, 400] and [400, +inf) is just impossible without squinting.<p>Overall it feels like there is more noise than information, which is a bummer.

Probably an essential feature for non-pros.<p>- You need a clear signup link. And the redirect when you run out of free credits should go to the signup page with small link to login, not the other way around.<p>- Also look at highcharts.com, they have a stock chart product as well.

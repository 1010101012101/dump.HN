They said they had a working demo (and this is corroborated by a number of investors) on which proper DD was performed prior to investing. I&#x27;m really not sure what to make of this. On the one hand it has me very skeptical on the other hand the number of reputations that will be tarnished forever if this turns out to be vapourware is substantial. You&#x27;d hope that those people putting their money and reputations on the line really did do their homework, uBeam would not deserve to get out of the gate let alone raise capital like that if their prototype never worked in the first place, it&#x27;s not that easy to rig a demo for a savvy tech DD team (though I can assure you it has been tried).<p>What bugs me is that uBeam is on the defensive all the time they should just show their tech or be very quiet. No need to tell the world it works if you can&#x27;t show it, who is the intended audience of all this &#x27;good news&#x27;? Or do they have a bunch of unruly investors to keep quiet who are getting antsy and are starting to pick up on the skepticism? That might actually explain all this attention diversion, attention that might be better used elsewhere (assuming this thing can work at all).",1446951561

As you point out, it&#x27;s only larger companies who have the resources to make a complete and ongoing attempt to comply with every little rule. Therefore a market has been created for tools to let small businesses carry on doing what they were previously doing quite happily anyway. Perhaps the most damning indictment of all is that this market will probably be served by... the same kinds of large multinationals that were rearranging their accounts to reduce their tax burdens in the first place, and that will now also be able to cream off a significant margin from many small businesses&#x27; transactions as well.<p>Incidentally, you missed one of my favourite points that the authorities still seem to have overlooked: they apparently continue to assume that those small businesses who do trade on-line are all selling something via some marketplace site, which can therefore take on much of the burden of compliance, record-keeping, and the like. I guess we&#x27;d all better start shorting Stripe, GoCardless, and friends, because presumably according to the EU they have no small business customers. ::facepalm::",1446951487

However, that&#x27;s before transmission losses and inefficiency in the charger and battery. Transmission is about 94% efficient (from <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&t=3</a>), charging is about 92% efficient, and the battery is about 90% efficient. That&#x27;s about 78% efficiency in total, so divide that 0.6lbs by 0.78 to get 0.77lbs of CO2 per mile.<p>Burning gallon of gasoline emits about 20 pounds of CO2. Dividing by 0.77lbs of CO2 per mile gives us an equivalent of 26MPG, approximately.<p>Not spectacular, but not bad. The Model S is a big and powerful car, and similar gas cars have similar or worse efficiency. You&#x27;d be better off driving a Prius in this contrived situation, but then the &quot;no real-world grid is 100% coal&quot; thing comes in. For example, my local grid is about one-third coal, one-third natural gas, one-third nuclear. That cuts CO2 in about half compared to 100% coal, so now it&#x27;s more like 52MPG. And coal&#x27;s share is constantly sliding downwards, so over the lifetime of the car that number will improve.<p>I don&#x27;t know as much about other emissions, but I&#x27;m confident the coal version will easily be better there. Big power plants are easier to run cleanly (they&#x27;re easier to monitor, they don&#x27;t care about weight nor much about space, and there&#x27;s a single stationary point to install scrubbers, filters, and whatever else) and they tend to be far away from people.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention losses in the system from before the act of combustion. For a proper accounting, you need to account for emissions for the whole chain, from getting the stuff out of the ground to moving the car. Coal is much more efficient at getting out of the ground and into the combustion chamber, since it&#x27;s already in burnable form, and then gets shipped in huge bulk by freight train. Efficiency losses there are single-digit percentages. Gasoline needs to be refined which alone takes something like 15% of the energy <i>in</i> the gasoline, plus transportation involves lots of small quantities being trucked all over the place. Total losses are about 20%.<p>I also want to say that I&#x27;m not really defending coal here, and I&#x27;d be quite happy if we could just stop burning it entirely. But the reality is that it&#x27;s there, and it sucks, but even sucking as much as it does, it&#x27;s still better than burning gas in hundreds of millions of little motors.",1446951176

If the overseas contractors have slowed down to a crawl, it&#x27;s probably not that they aren&#x27;t &quot;aligned&quot; or willing, but that they can&#x27;t.<p>If they had the ability to fix the project themselves or their process, they would have.<p>The usual non-technical customer approach would be to demand or plead for the developers to work harder. I&#x27;ve never seen this turn a problem overseas project into a successful one.<p>To unstick, you&#x27;ve got to first is to figure what is wrong, and secondly fix that.<p>But at this point, you don&#x27;t know what is wrong, and developers don&#x27;t know what is wrong or find it culturally impossible to communicate the problem.<p>I&#x27;d recommend getting some skilled local technical talent to take a look at the code and the recent commits to get a feel for what the underlying problem is.<p>-<p>Off the top of my head, the four mostly likely problems would be:<p>1. Frameworkitis - Many frameworks, when doing something the framework is not designed to do, require far more code than would normally be require. This even ends up hitting harder since often these overrides must be done in ways that either can&#x27;t be reused, or must be done in one place, tangling everything together.<p>2. Overwhelming technical debt - Spaghetti code, untested business logic, the usual.<p>3. Too much business complexity in the code - Given that the cofounders are not technical, they may have been asking for things that make for a lot of complexity, and the development team may not have pushed back. This can kill later development, since adding new features to complex systems is usually much more difficulty. Alternately, since this is a new business, it&#x27;s possible that the requirements have been changing, leaving the system more complicated than it needs to be.<p>4. The developers could simply not have the skills required - A company had me see if I could speed up their application. It was days away from launch. The home page took EIGHT MINUTES to load. (with no customers using the site, only 50,000 records in the database, and static data that only changed every couple months.) Eight minutes to generate a single page!<p>The customer had been telling the overseas developers that this was a problem for weeks. The overseas developers were unable to figure out why, for weeks. After tracking down the problem, I added a cache in front of one piece of code, and took the site from an eight minute page generate time down to under a second.<p>The speed problem was not just due to a terrible architecture, nor a complete ignorance of what the frameworks involved were doing under hood, but mostly that not one person on the overseas team - even the &quot;senior&quot; developer - know that it was possible to find out which parts of code are slow.<p>-<p>To summarize again, probably the contractors cannot fix whatever is currently wrong, and outside eyes are needed.",1446950234

Rather than just a webpage or single report, Enlis Genome Personal is a full application that you install on your computer and load your genome data.<p>Ability to load multiple genomes and compare them side-by-side. You can load all your family member genomes together, or load multiple copies of your own genome (i.e. you have data from 23andMe and Ancestry.com), or you can compare your genome to available sample data.<p>Ability to generate custom disease and trait PDFs, suitable for email or printing. A sample Macular Degeneration PDF is sent with every free genome report.<p>For a particular disease or trait, this software will tell you how many known disease positions were successfully sequenced in your data, and how many are missing. For example, if you are interested in a hereditary disease like Cystic Fibrosis, it will indicate there are 270 known variants that cause Cystic Fibrosis. Your data covers 101 of those positions, and there is missing data on 169 positions.<p>More extensive information on each SNP, like variant mammalian conservation, or variant deleterious predictions. Much more information on the function of genes and where in the body those genes are expressed.<p>User friendly interface that is easy to use. Includes a genome browser so you can see your data in the context of genes and chromosomes.<p>For 23andMe users - better quality control and more data:\n        We discovered over 500 SNPs with inaccurate data in the 23andMe results, and we automatically filter those out. See blog post here.\n        We are the only service to identify and analyze over 1,000 of 23andMe&#x27;s proprietary insertions and deletions. Most of these can have a health impact. See blog post here.<p>For users with whole genome or exome data:\n        We give you the tools to make new discoveries about your data. Advanced variation filter, phenotype explorer, homozygous region analysis, and over 20,000 built-in gene categories.\n        An example - our founder used this software to discover a cause of a rare phenotype in his whole genome data.

Gold/silver wasn&#x27;t used until fairly recently - 15th century IIRC and for a lot of the time the value of the coin was in no way correlated to the metal it was printed on. Gold caught on in a time of market crisis because the rulers thought that telling people that the metal itself was valuable it would give them more confidence in the currency. Also it&#x27;s convenient for currency because it&#x27;s both absolutely useless and rare (hard to counterfeit).",1446948000

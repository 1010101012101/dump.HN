244890,comment,244826,244882,0,0,sfg,,,"Of course it is subjective, it is is me that does not care about children's mathematics. I make no claim for the wider world. That's why I said ""My only problem"" and not ""the problem"".<p>Its not entirely arbitrary though. I care about research mathematics as to do well at it(or to do it at all) requires very strong mathematical abilities. To do well in classroom mathematics is as much, and probably more, to do with being a good student.<p>So it seems to me that by looking at children's mathematics rather than research mathematics your results are going to be confounded by the issue that your measuring mathematics ability via a proxy(schoolroom mathematics) rather than the real thing(research mathematics). Your results might still be correct, but I find it hard to know if that is the case.<p>I suppose, if your just interested in day to day average numeracy skills then looking at children is fine, except even then I would prefer the study was performed on adults rather than regularly drilled students. That way you will find out who is more capable of retaining numeracy skills and who has the higher natural levels of numeracy, rather than just finding out which students revise the hardest and listen to the teacher most attentively.",1215924986

This is much easier, and can be done now(!).  Nail this down, make it known to your users that you have this feature and see what traffic looks like.  If you see some real iPhone usage, and really think it's going to improve usage, user experience etc. then go for it.  I'm betting it won't though and that there are TODOs that are much more important than an iPhone app.",1215924902

244883,comment,244826,244826,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The problem here is mean vs variance. The biggest performers in math and science are going to be at least a few standard deviations away from the mean.<p>Identical mean and slightly higher variance in men would significantly contribute to the ratios we see today.<p>Either way, the goal shouldn't be to make everyone feel good about innate abilities. The goal should be to find the reason why one person is innately better than someone else in a particular skill. Step 1: understanding. Step 2: enhancement. Step 3: repeat.<p>Similar to the recent JL post: forget the gap, focus on the product. It matters most.",1215924144

While multitasking I hit the Drop button on a Production Database because I had two tabs open comparing some configuration parameters between my local install versus the production. Lost few days of data since the automated backup was not quite automated yet.<p>Lesson learned: make backup scheduler top priority on your to-do list. And check it often.",1214913400

232861,story,,,6,9,nikhils,"Ask YC: Equity question for very early stage startup ",,"We are a team of three co-founders, each with equal equity share (1/3 each, we've yet to gain funding as we're still early on our journey).<p>We have an opportunity for someone to get involved who has lots to bring to the business, having worked for one of the major players in the space. He loves the concept and wants to take an active role in the company - more than just adviser but not quite co-founder as he currently has a full-time job.<p>So we are in a quandary: how to decide what equity share he is worth to us? As of yet, we do not have a valuation. So I'm not sure how we can apply the 1/(1-n) rule (Ref. one of PG's essays) in this case.<p>Here are some thoughts we've had so far...<p>- Difficult to base it on the value he'll bring to the company but this is obviously the standard way of giving away equity. So how do we solve this problem?<p>- It's likely he'll be helping us with gaining funding, so we've thought about structuring it as a ""base + bonus"" share, dependent on how much money he helps us secure.<p>So are there standard ways of approaching this kind of situation? And what questions should we be asking ourselves?<p>If anyone has particular thoughts on it we'd be really keen to speak to you in more detail about what we're doing.<p>Many thanks,<p>Nikhil",1214913169

232853,comment,232533,232646,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"I'm thinking out loud here and this has been mentioned before (although not really discussed) how about allowing people to spend their karma?<p>ie If I think something is worth 20 karma I give it 20 of my karma. If I think something should lose 10 karma I have to pay 10 karma to remove it.<p>It sounds scary as it could introduce a lot of volatility. The main benefit however would be that people are a lot more judicious when voting as it comes at a price.<p>I'm not saying it would work but it would be bloody interesting. Obviously there would have to be a source of new karma or else we would experience deflation. It could be trialled for a month or two with an agreement to go back to the previous system and to restore previous karma levels should things go tits up.<p>Thoughts?<p>Edit: forgot to say that removes the need for any potentially large amounts of computation to calculate weightings.",1214910545

What if the person who knows exactly how to do what you want to do is someone elses XP buddy? Now you have two people stalled instead of just one.<p>There is ample evidence that ""ownership"" of code results in better quality and a more motivated workforce. People like seeing a feature from inception to completion. So long as basic conventions are adhered to, there's no need for anyone to touch anyone elses code except in a genuine emergency.<p>Can you point to any open source project that is actually collectively owned?

3391005,comment,3385596,3385596,1,0,daly,,,"Curiously I think you missed the more important point of\nthe post. The literate programming insight is clearly\nmore valuable as a ""take-away"" idea.<p>Literate programming has the potential to allow a program\nto ""live"". Certainly it allows a program to outlive the\nauthors. Most programs no longer have the original authors\navailable. Look at the thousands of dead programs on sites\nlike Sourceforge. Or consider the number of commercial\nprograms that are no longer maintained by the authors.<p>Your program should be written to pass the ""Hawaii test"".\nThat is, you give a new hire your literate source code,\nsend them on a fully paid trip to Hawaii for two weeks.\nWhen they come back they should be able to maintain and\nmodify the program as well as the original authors.<p>Literate programming is not documentation. It is a form\nof communication. You need to motivate code you introduce.\nYou need a good story line. You need to get it past an\neditor-in-chief.<p>See ""Lisp in Small Pieces"" for a great literate program\nexample.<p>Tim Daly\ndaly@axiom-developer.org",1324821023

Just reading about it is not enough.<p>Note that there are many variants of Lisp. Older Lisp versions are suitable for experts only. For beginners I would recommend Scheme which is a well defined successor of Lisp. I would recommend Racket (<a href=""http://racket-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://racket-lang.org/</a>) as SDK.

They also need coursework easily digestible by people from a variety of backgrounds that prepare students for post MBA careers.  In general this means accounting, finance and to a lesser degree marketing strategy.  What is left out are the harder to teach items - emotional intelligence, judgment, etc.   These soft skills come from the school of hard knocks, with perhaps a few short cuts from good mentors.

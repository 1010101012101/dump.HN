The article mentions maintenance is a big problem for imported solutions, so they&#x27;ll need to teach locals on how to maintain/build the tower. There aren&#x27;t too many people who knows enough to build such a tower, so they cannot simply spend $500 * 1000 to get towers for 100 villages, since they need to first teach people to build it and second teach people in each village to maintain it. Perhaps, the first year the target is more than just 2 towers, but learning how to make the tower easier to maintain as well as learning how best to &#x27;sell&#x27; the tower to locals.",1397292889

Presumably this is the same kind of person that emails Bill Gates whenever they have a Windows problem.<i></i><p>Emailing open source developers who you do not know at their personal email addresses is rarely appropriate when a public mailing list for the project exists. The tone is a little prickly but what Henson says seems reasonable to me.",1397290151

Someone can check whether the time savings of having to make fewer stops for gas is worth it. The fuel consumption and engine wear savings certainly seems good to me.<p>Update: There is also aerodynamics to think about. Aerodynamic drag is almost twice as great at 70mph as it is at 50mph.[1]<p>[1]<a href=""http://craig.backfire.ca/pages/autos/drag"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craig.backfire.ca/pages/autos/drag</a>",1397290078

Since the toast is cooling off and giving off some steam it will add a significant amount of moisture more than the air originally had.  Once that happens the dew point will quickly reach the current room temperature.  Raising the temperature of the plate above that temperature means that there is more moisture needed to do this.",1397290068

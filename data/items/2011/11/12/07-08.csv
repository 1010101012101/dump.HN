3227375,comment,3225055,3226142,2,0,zach,,,"To me, the clearest mandate for using three dimensions for file management is in creating a space that people can become as mentally familiar with as they can with a house.<p>We already know that one of the most powerful methods for creating a lasting memory of intangible items, the ""memory palace"", is basically walking around a three-dimensional space.<p>It seems clear that there is a possibility here to create a fully-functional three-dimensional metaphor.  However, it is not an evolutionary step.  It would be something so foreign that it would be better to teach it to people who never managed files before.  And to be honest, with apologies to Dropbox, the numbers of such folks is back on the rise because file management itself is an increasingly irrelevant task, not just on iOS but on Chromebooks and just about any non-desktop computing device.<p>And so although there is a very interesting potential, I have to wonder if the quest for better file management is even worth fretting over anymore.  Hasn't being ""ready for the desktop"" largely been an exercise in skating to where the puck has been?  Maybe a revolutionary file manager would have been strategic ten years ago, but now?<p>So I welcome Canonical's focus on touch devices. Yet I'm concerned about the sheer inertia of maintaining an identity, in being Ubuntu, on a significantly different platform.  We saw how well the Windows Tablet PC succeeded at being Windows, and in so doing lost the platform.  I sure hope that's not what happens here.",1321083636

3227368,comment,3225055,3227209,3,0,jmoiron,,,"Except that lots of people don't agree with you.  People have already been using gnome-do (quicksilver) for fast keyboard app launching for a few years;  it's faster, more focused, and less keystrokes than the Unity bar.  You also can't use it without installing some extra stuff and getting unity to give up its monopoly on the mod (win) key.<p>As for the alt+tab functionality..  well, if you are used to OSX and its third rate window management (can't move or resize windows without aiming at a tiny bar or handle?) and broken virtual desktop implementation, then maybe this kind of impoverished behavior is a welcome change.  Since I have OSX experience, global menu's aren't a big problem for me, except when they are hidden by default and show up on different screens depending on window location.  An interesting compromise for multi-monitor users, but mystery-meat menu decision is mind boggling.<p>For people who have now had ~16 years of window-centric keyboard navigation, having no good muscle-memory way to switch among 3 windows in 2 different applications is a nightmare.    Having alt-tab slide your entire desktop over is just an insult on top of that injury.  We use exact same set of tools (vim, chrome, and a terminal), but you must only ever use one window each;  I can't imagine how you could tolerate the new app-switcher's behavior otherwise.<p>Your point about the only change being the font is also interesting, since in Ubuntu 11.10 you cannot change your fonts (or any colors on your theme, or gtk2 themes which a majority of apps will still use) without installing some third party tool with a terrible UI that looks worse than anything has since gnome-2 was released.  The terminal is the only program that provides a UI for changing it.<p>In general, I agree with the posts in this thread that say you can massage the XFCE desktop into a worse version of what gnome-2 was about 3 years ago.  After trying very hard to get along in Unity and 11.10 (gvim freezes for 30 seconds on start-up if you have installed foreign language packs, a bug fedora fixed about 9 months ago but persists in ubuntu), I've given up am using XFCE w/ Compiz (which doesn't work that great but is usable) until I find a weekend where I can ditch it for something else.<p>The part that's sad is that I did not find Gnome3 to be much better than Unity;  it still has the same ""enhanced"" (broken) window/app collection which I find completely unsuitable for doing real work without encountering incredible friction.  So for me (and probably others), Gnome3 has joined KDE4 as some unusable tangent, essentially killing off systems I was very happy and productive with.  Gnome2 is a temporary fix;  it's a dead end.  XFCE still feels very spartan;  in the past 3 years Gnome2 has got better and better and XFCE has barely moved.  Hopefully, someone (maybe Mint, or maybe the ElementaryOS guys) will raid the remnants of Gnome2 come up with a system that has a living development path.",1321083306

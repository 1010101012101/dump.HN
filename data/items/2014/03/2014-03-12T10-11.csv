First, there&#x27;s a pretty steep drop off from #1 to #25 - a 5.0 for #1 (of which there are four) down to a 3.6 at #25. I didn&#x27;t even notice until, on page 2, I say Texas A&M listed at #40 (w/ a 3.1). &quot;A&M&quot; stands for &quot;Agriculture and Marine&quot;. Second, the rankings &quot;stop&quot; at #112 which is a 2.0 - however, there are still probably 30 more schools listed as &quot;Ranking not published&quot;. Third, to have a school like SMU ranked as &quot;last place&quot; (#112) behind some of the other &quot;schools you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot; just feels wrong. SMU gets a 2.0 which, according to their scale, is one step above &quot;marginal&quot;. I can imagine that, from a job hunting perspective, it&#x27;s far easier to place an 3.x SMU CS grad than it is to place a 3.x &quot;University of Maryland - Baltimore County&quot; grad, both now and long-term.",1394621915

I understand why open floorplans don&#x27;t work for some people but I personally enjoy working in one and always have so I don&#x27;t see them as bad for developers, only bad for <i>some</i>. The conversations floating around, the noise and animation helps me focus a lot more than in a closed office at work. I don&#x27;t know exactly why but I work a lot better with a lot of people around me. Also it is so much easier to follow what is going on around in your team, who is stuck on something, who is speaking about something new that might be useful to you.<p>I&#x27;ve always worked this way, focusing on something while a part of me was processing what was said around and being able to &quot;pause&quot; what I was doing to help around and get back to my work pretty easily. Of course it does not work all the time and some times you just need to focus for a few hours and in this case I just increase the volume of my music in my headphones and stop caring about the rest.<p>For me the main issue with open floorplans is when other people assume they can just come to your desk and ask you anything without thinking you could be busy and/or in the zone as you describe it when having a closed office would make them think twice before just dropping by unanounced.

One quote from a NYT interview:<p>> One of the things we’ve seen from all our data crunching is that G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless — no correlation at all except for brand-new college grads, where there’s a slight correlation. Google famously used to ask everyone for a transcript and G.P.A.’s and test scores, but we don’t anymore, unless you’re just a few years out of school. We found that they don’t predict anything.<p>>  What’s interesting is the proportion of people without any college education at Google has increased over time as well. So we have teams where you have 14 percent of the team made up of people who’ve never gone to college.<p>>After two or three years, your ability to perform at Google is completely unrelated to how you performed when you were in school, because the skills you required in college are very different. You’re also fundamentally a different person. You learn and grow, you think about things differently.<p>> Another reason is that I think academic environments are artificial environments. People who succeed there are sort of finely trained, they’re conditioned to succeed in that environment. One of my own frustrations when I was in college and grad school is that you knew the professor was looking for a specific answer. You could figure that out, but it’s much more interesting to solve problems where there isn’t an obvious answer. You want people who like figuring out stuff where there is no obvious answer.<p>Even in your own scenario, would you prefer someone who graduated with a 3.25 and triple majored in physics, business, and history, or would you prefer someone with a 3.75 who majored in business?",1394620121

Practical benefits would be gravy for someone who enjoys Sedgewick...who also has courses on Coursera.<p>And when I mention Coursera, I&#x27;m talking about the free stuff not the new program with Georgia Tech.

Tasks like opening tabs and loading pages seemed subjectively faster than doing the same on my 4GHz desktop. I also like how my attention was never consumed by irrelevant details like it always is in a desktop os.<p>In places where GNOME treats the user like an idiot by needlessly hiding useful functionality, Chrome makes specific tasks quick and painless. Surely, the fact that Chrome tries to do less, and benefits from a clean slate helps this, but there is still a very clear winner in this comparison.<p>I&#x27;d use it (chrome os) a lot if it had decent native text editing, and wasn&#x27;t a botnet.<p>Hopefully a WM comparable in performance and UI design to Chrome&#x27;s will be supported in GNU/Linux distros soon.",1394619159

Water is already a relativly low-energy compound, so I assume you are talking about using it to manufacture hydrogen molecules to use as fuel.<p>An external source of water is completely unnecessary for this. The idea behind hydrogen as a fuel is that you can react it with oxygen to produce water, which is a lower energy molecule. You can then harness that difference in energy to do whatever. The amount of water generated is equal to the amount of water needed to generate the hydrogen (and oxygen) molecules in the first place. It is a rechargable battery.",1377755390

Also, I thought mitmproxy was intended for HTTPS.  Even in that case, I&#x27;m not sure installing Python and mitmproxy is necessary if all you want is to view your own traffic.  You can just run your own CA and a proxy that can terminate SSL (e.g., haproxy).<p>Below is a simple, _lightweight_ ngrep solution.  RE means a regular expression.  This only saves packets with the RE you specify and does not save full packets, only the HTTP headers.  1024 is an arbitrary size to get all HTTP headers; adjust to taste.  tcpdump is there only because ngrep does not work well with PPPoE.

Wal-Mart needs low prices and lots of products to satisfy theirs.",1377752453

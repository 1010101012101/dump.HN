Then again, it think it always has been. The difference now is that the media is owned by a the parties (or the parties and the media have become one) and simply push the party line rather than pushing a particular candidate. And the particular candidate that will move the nation farthest in the party/media&#x27;s direction gets the most positive attention. And any candidate from the opposite side becomes &quot;Hitler Satan&quot; (TM).<p><i>>> ...media are really, really bad.</i><p>No, the media has become really, really good! It&#x27;s just that what their good at is not what you think you want out of media.

Which is really not meant to be a knock on our teachers, but I don&#x27;t think your typical school has the people with the right skill sets to teach &quot;true&quot; computing.<p>They don&#x27;t realistically have any choice but to rely on the watered-down end user version experienced through the walled-garden of one vendor or another.

What, educators were worried children wouldn&#x27;t spend enough time staring at glowing rectangles, and needed to get a head start? Really?<p>It&#x27;s not clear whether most adults are even capable of making good decisions about what technologies to invite into their lives. Inflicting computers and software on children in a classroom, I think, demonstrates either profound lack of understanding about the state of these technologies, or judgement, or both.<p>Pens, pencils, crayons, markers, paper, books, musical instruments. These are the kinds of things that belong in classrooms. Children should be reading and drawing and building and talking and playing creatively, learning to think and solve problems based on experiencing the world directly, not trying to sip secondhand information through the straw of a screen, not wasting time with the latest malware and ads and passwords and an infinite amount of other stupid computer bullshit.

You&#x27;ll have to rewrite the entire education process to figure out how to harness computers.<p>Let me give a concrete example. I am now a fantastic speller, of a language that is one of the harder languages to spell. Am I fantastic because I&#x27;m just that awesome? No! Am I fantastic because I have spent years studying lists of words and taking spelling tests? <i>Hell</i> no! I&#x27;m fantastic now because every major text input I use now has the red-squiggly line, and the instant I misspell a word and hit space, <i>bam</i>, red line. Backspace & correct. Right-click and select if I really, really can&#x27;t work it out. (But with backspace & correct actually being way faster, I prefer that.) With instant feedback comes a high rate of learning. I can tell this isn&#x27;t &quot;cheating&quot;, because when I do function in an environment where I don&#x27;t have this functionality, I retain my spelling skill, the golden standard of whether a skill exists in the tools or the brain. In fact I write many of my blog posts in emacs with no spelling support on, and while I still scan over my posts with a spell checker before posting them, I routinely experience writing several thousand words without a single misspelling, because I have harnessed solid technology to train my brain. I also spell well with handwriting.<p>This is unbelievably fantastic technology for teaching spelling so efficiently and so effectively that it hardly even need be explicitly taught; sit students down in front of this technology and have them simply <i>write</i> and let the red squiggly handle the spelling training. (You&#x27;ll still need vocabulary training, but, again, let the red squiggly handle the <i>spelling</i> of the vocabulary while the vocabulary training focuses on meanings.)<p>By contrast, doing spelling tests &quot;but on a computer&quot; is a terrible way of doing business! First of all, if the students have to &quot;turn in&quot; the test before they get feedback, you&#x27;ve already missed the sub-second feedback rate that would have been so much better anyhow, but second of all, the fact that you&#x27;re having a spelling test <i>at all</i> is a huge waste of their time. That&#x27;s the sort of second-order effect we need to be harnessing with computers in the classroom, and we are only at the very, very beginning of that road.<p>My first grader is just starting spelling tests. He&#x27;s not quite computer savvy enough to start writing on a computer yet, but you can believe I&#x27;ll be setting him up with a red squiggly as soon as is practicable.<p>I still believe computers are going to rewrite education from top-to-bottom, but I find it is proving to be one of the most entrenched, hidebound, nearsighted, and even perhaps <i>terrified of real change</i> elements of society we can possibly imagine. We&#x27;re so scare of what bad things might happen if we <i>don&#x27;t</i> stuff a conventional education into our children&#x27;s heads (moreso than ever, thanks to ever-more test-based education) that we&#x27;re <i>terrified</i> of experimenting with anything new, and the only acceptable change to the &quot;conventional&quot; education is to precommit <i>even more</i> time to it, making it that much harder to work any experimentation into the system. There are major religions that treat their holy texts as more flexible than the way our culture treats the official line of How Children Are Taught.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2916</a>",1449500090

We could evolve our economic systems to redistribute obscene wealth and build a more egalitarian society.

I don&#x27;t think I can roll my eyes hard enough....<p>> One of my saddest days in my digital classroom was when the children rushed in from the lunchroom one rainy recess and dashed for their iPads. Wait, I implored, we play with Legos on rainy days! I dumped out the huge container of Legos that were pure magic just a couple of weeks ago, that prompted so much collaboration and conversation, but the delight was gone. My students looked at me with disdain. Some crossed their arms and pouted. We aren’t kids who just play anymore, their crossed arms implied. We’re iPad users. We’re tech-savvy. Later, when I allowed their devices to hum to glowing life, conversation shut down altogether.<p>Look I loved Lego&#x27;s growing up, I still have massive rubbermaid containers full of them but please tell me why playing with Legos is any more valuable than playing minecraft? Let&#x27;s not pretend that just because kids like different things now that something MUST be lost. I never played a cup-and-ball game like I&#x27;m sure generations before me did (I&#x27;m sure they lamented the introduction of things like Lego). Every generation complains about the younger generation and how they are going to turn out wrong because they weren&#x27;t raised the same way they were or with the same things (&quot;I walked up hill to school both ways&quot;).<p>Did the kids get quieter? Sure, I have no doubt of that but who&#x27;s to say they weren&#x27;t communicating even more than before using chat programs? I had teachers in HS CONSTANTLY complain about how students were reading less and less all the time which I took issue with not only because I read plenty of books but also I read tons of articles online. The medium may change but the core concept remains IHMO. Reading Pride and Prejudice doesn&#x27;t automatically make you a better person than the student who know what&#x27;s happening in the world like the back of their hand.<p>Lastly not introducing them to tech now is just setting them up for failure down the line. For better or worse the people who know technology will excel more than those who don&#x27;t. Tech is not it&#x27;s own little sector/industry, it&#x27;s everywhere and it&#x27;s integrated in to everything.

Having used both Clojure and Go there are some significant differences in how coroutines work in each.<p>For instance, in Go making a blocking system call inside of a goroutine &quot;just works&quot; as Go will create additional goroutines as necessary. But if you do the equivalent in Clojure, you risk thread starvation.<p>&quot;However if you are using go blocks and blocking IO calls you&#x27;re in trouble. You will in fact often get worse performance than using threads (in the normal case) since you will quickly hog all the threads in the go block thread pool and block out any other work! ... Since the go block thread pool is quite small, it&#x27;s easy to block all the threads and thus stopping all &#x27;go processing&#x27;.&quot;[0]<p>Now there are some ways around this; I think that you can use promises for blocking IO inside of a Clojure coroutine. But this is one area where you don&#x27;t have to worry about this kind of thing in Go, even if you do have to know that the default map implementation isn&#x27;t thread safe. :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://martintrojer.github.io/clojure/2013/07/07/coreasync-and-blocking-io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martintrojer.github.io/clojure/2013/07/07/coreasync-a...</a>",1449498798

10689542,comment,10688005,10688235,0,0,hga,,,"Here&#x27;s my initial reply, especially since Medium looks really awkward for commenting:<p>Add <i>McDonald v. Chicago</i>, 561 U.S. 742 (2010) where the Supremes incorporated the 2nd Amendment against the states, forcing Chicago and its suburbs to allow gun ownership, and the case law WRT to states and the RKBA is clear.<p>It’s very doubtful the number of households that own guns has decreased since 1960, when the latest round of gun control was just starting to get strong (I came of political age in the late &#x27;60s, so I directly remember this).  Responses to anonymous telephone callers asking if you own a gun roughly tracks how successful gun controllers are at the time.<p>When I did a back of the envelope calculation about the claims by the usual suspects that existing gun owners were buying all the new guns as of late, it would have us owning about $100K worth of them on average.<p>The increase in ownership for self-protection no doubt tracks the nationwide sweep of “shall issue” concealed carry laws in the states starting with Florida in 1986, which went from less than a handful to 42 now, covering most of the population. If you don’t live in Illinois, this state level political effort is is the single biggest change since 1968, and the biggest change of the facts on the ground since the early 20th Century.<p>Without looking at [13], obviously you can turn around the implied causation to “For every 0.9% of firearm homicides, there is a 1% increase of people in a community owning guns.”  Although simply being allowed to legally carry them outside your home drastically increased their utility.  Handgun sales in total and of their type track this.<p>In the US, gun buybacks are an opportunity for savvy gun owners to sell junk for more than it’s worth, and to work the line looking for valuable guns about to be turned in for a nominal payment, and buy them for much more like what they’re worth.<p>You no longer believe strongly that &quot;Gun ranges have a net positive impact on gun safety because inexperienced people are taught by people who know how to handle weapons.&quot; and you&#x27;re right from my anecdotal study.  Going further, I&#x27;m beyond amazed at how well poorly or not at all trained and experienced people responsibly use firearms in self-defense.  Chalk it up to centuries of improving ergonomic design in guns, reaching perfection for handguns a century ago, a healthy gun culture, perhaps even Hollywood (although the gun handling on screen is generally awful), and informal training, which I&#x27;ve done my share of.<p>&quot;Has concealed carry successfully stopped shootings?&quot;  Well, it&#x27;s certainly stopped the wrong people from getting shot, now even in Chicago after the Federal courts forced shall issue concealed carry on Illinois.<p>&quot;Lock up your safety&quot; laws like California&#x27;s has definitely killed people.  We in the gun community of course encourage locking up most of your guns most of the time, but I doubt you&#x27;ll get good statistical evidence on anything about this.<p>America has way too much &quot;empty&quot; space to make restrictions on using guns only at formal firing ranges.<p>While I can&#x27;t prove it to you (should you even believe my personal pledge?), such restrictions, or an Australian style gun confiscation, would turn our current cold civil war into a hot one, and a lot of people would die on both sides.  The most recent evidence for this is the small fractions of people in the Bluest of Blue states of Connecticut and New York who registered their evil &quot;assault weapons&quot; (a purely political term) after Sandy Hook inspired legislation.  If you can&#x27;t succeed there....<p>ADDED: you have to be very careful interpreting the &quot;research&quot; some people and outfits do.  Best example is the infamous Kellerman study in the once prestigious NEJM which, even before you get into all the lower level problems, scores a &quot;success&quot; for a gun owner only as <i>killing</i> a home invader.  Needless to say, out of the 2.5 or so million gun self-defense incidents per year, only a small fraction even involve a gun being fired, let alone hitting, let alone killing an assailant.<p>(As a rough metric some time ago but after trauma centers were established, I&#x27;ve read that one handgun round into someone&#x27;s torso has a 1/4th chance of killing them.  Mostly anecdotally, as many as 1/2 of all assailants stop attacking after being hit once, even if the hit is not immediately disabling).<p>While I didn&#x27;t look at all your sources, or closely at the ones I glanced at, I didn&#x27;t see any notorious howlers like Kellerman&#x27;s.<p>ADDED: for someone apparently completely uneducated on the subject, you did a <i>fantastic</i> job for a few hours of effort.",1449497944

10689522,comment,10688898,10689190,0,0,laotzu,,,">For the past 3500 years of the Western world, the effects of media–whether it’s speech, writing, printing, photography, radio or television–have been systematically overlooked by social observers. Even in today’s revolutionary electronic age, scholars evidence few signs of modifying this traditional stance of ostrich-like disregard.<p>>Because all media, from the phonetic alphabet to the computer, are extensions of man that cause deep and lasting changes in him and transform his environment. Such an extension is an intensification, an amplification of an organ, sense or function, and whenever it takes place, the central nervous system appears to institute a self-protective numbing of the affected area, insulating and anesthetizing it from conscious awareness of what’s happening to it. It’s a process rather like that which occurs to the body under shock or stress conditions, or to the mind in line with the Freudian concept of repression. I call this peculiar form of self-hypnosis Narcissus narcosis, a syndrome whereby man remains as unaware of the psychic and social effects of his new technology as a fish of the water it swims in. As a result, precisely at the point where a new media-induced environment becomes all pervasive and transmogrifies our sensory balance, it also becomes invisible.<p>>This problem is doubly acute today because man must, as a simple survival strategy, become aware of what is happening to him, despite the attendant pain of such comprehension. The fact that he has not done so in this age of electronics is what has made this also the age of anxiety, which in turn has been transformed into its Doppelganger–the therapeutically reactive age of anomie and apathy. But despite our self protective escape mechanisms, the total-field awareness engendered by electronic media is enabling us–indeed, compelling us–to grope toward a consciousness of the unconscious, toward a realization that technology is an extension of our own bodies.<p>-Marshall McLuhan",1449497788

Everest <i>stands</i> 8km tall.&quot; In many cases, it&#x27;s all about moving away from declaring a property of a subject (&quot;X is Y&quot;) to using the verb that causes the subject to exhibit the property.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with this concept but this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of it formalized with a name, or used outside of creative/narrative writing. When I was in high school, a writing teacher made my class perform an exercise to memorize a superset of the &quot;to be&quot; verbs. The rationale was that, while these verbs are direct and objective, they are &quot;flat&quot; and fail to engage a reader.<p>In the case of descriptors/properties that simply require too much wrangling to find an appropriate verb - the case of color came up elsewhere in these comments, as in &quot;the barn is blue&quot; - the guiding rule is that those descriptors shouldn&#x27;t be the focus of a sentence in the first place. &quot;The barn was blue&quot; is not interesting enough to stand on its own as a sentence and something else needs to take the verb. &quot;The blue barn loomed over the landscape&quot; or &quot;The blue barn dominated his thoughts.&quot;<p>Writing a Wikipedia article in this style is certainly an interesting exercise, but given the goal of a Wikipedia article I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good fit. An encyclopedia entry is not narrative and needs to be direct and objective.<p>As an aside, her exercise proved to be oddly effective, as I can still recite the list from memory: am, is, are, was, were, have, has, had, be, been, being, do, does, did, can, could, shall, should, will, would, may, might, must. :)",1449497100

The point of a solver is that you give it a problem in a formal, relatively unambiguous language, and it finds a proof. At the moment this really only works for maths problems, and even then you often need a specialist solver for the type of problem. General solvers are coming though, and they&#x27;ll expand beyond maths and they&#x27;ll accept more and more ambiguous language - often that will mean they come up with the wrong solution, but that&#x27;s just a matter of iterating until something is correct.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting one day you&#x27;ll open up Notepad and type &quot;The user is in a dystopian world full of Raiders&quot; and get Fallout 4, but I strongly believe you&#x27;ll be able to write &quot;The first page is a form with inputs for name, address and email.

Clearly the person I want in office is the candidate who is the brightest. Who therefore attracts the brightest people to volunteer for his campaign. And results in a sensible web site.<p>hm...

299036,comment,298904,298945,0,0,neilvandyke,,,"I believe my rationale at the time was that my implementation would probably be imperfect in some way wrt the de facto standard of the reference implementation, so I didn't want to presumptuously call it ""Arc.""<p>And also, every project should have a cute name.

I'm amazed that the people in this thread honestly believe that the HTML rendering code is anything but a side-issue at google. Management probably just said to the engs, ""Okay, use whatever's best"" and that was that.<p>Almost every dollar google makes comes through IE and Firefox. It's like...if Fedex only had two drivers, one of whom was a UPS shareholder, and the other a revolutionary socialist. I don't know how google could <i>not</i> view this as a strategic problem.

299028,comment,298719,298783,0,0,unalone,,,"My first reaction upon seeing the Amazon site was precisely that: ""How immature.""<p>I would be astonished if Spore flopped. Right now, we're seeing hardcore gamers and freeks (or freetards, or whatever they're called right now) complaining. The mass market hasn't heard a thing about Spore.<p>On a whim, I told a friend about Spore two days ago. Her instant reaction: ""I need to uninstall The Sims 2 to get this."" I think that'll be a common reaction. Spore has a big marketing campaign going on right now, but it could win the world over through word-of-mouth alone.",1220927397

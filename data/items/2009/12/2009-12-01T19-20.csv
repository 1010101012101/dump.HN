970546,comment,969646,970325,0,0,cschneid,,,"There's a contradiction inherent with that ""thinking different"" argument.  If you accept that women on a large scale (ie, no individual example, but as a group of millions of people) think differently, then it's not absurd to say that they don't tend towards computing and hard-science as often.<p>Women have different biology, their bodies respond differently, they fall ill to different diseases but somehow it's become taboo to say that perhaps they think differently too, and therefore tend towards different disciplines. The brain is just another organ after all...<p>An example from a similar field: 90% of NFL Wide Receivers are Black. Does that mean the NFL is racist? Or that black people's genetic heritage skews their speed&strength bell curve slightly to the right so that the top hundredth of a percent is slightly above white's top hundredth of a percent?  I tend to believe it's the second.<p>Please note that I know some nerd girls (mostly from the CS and EE programs), and nothing I say indicates that opportunities should be closed, or discrimination should happen, but you can't look at a number like ""15% of comp-sci students are women"" and immediately assume something is wrong.<p>I don't doubt that social pressures are playing a role here, with general pressure to ""be pretty, not smart"", but I don't think it explains away all of it.  I am not putting forward a theory of everything here, just expressing my frustration with general feminism thoughts that everybody is fundamentally identical, except for socialization.<p>Well, this is going to turn bad I'm sure, I've touched on sex AND race.... but the central argument across all 3 is similar. There are bell curves everywhere in biology, and they are slightly skewed and stretched across different groups.  No individual point is enough to make a decision (""you're a woman"" doesn't say anything about computer ability, just as saying ""you're black"" doesn't make them a wide receiver), but on a mass-scale they predict percentages and expectations.",1259696769

970522,comment,969765,969765,0,0,dpatru,,,"I think there's a fundamental misalignment of interests in the news business between 1) readers who want high-quality, unbiased reporting, 2) advertisers who want to sell something to the readers and are thus biased, and 3) the news companies who want to satisfy both readers and advertisers. The problem is similar to the interaction between a customer seeking financial advice from a financial consultant who makes money selling securities: a consumer can't know whether he's being given unbiased information or a sales pitch.<p>Perhaps people don't pay for ""news"" because they don't usually pay for sales pitches.<p>One way to solve this is to openly declare one's identity. Consumers of unbiased news or entertainment are willing to pay; but the consumer of unbiased news will be more intolerant of paying for the news by seeing ads: how can someone deliver the unbiased news while at the same time being a salesman?<p>Providers of unbiased news should sell their service, unbiased news, to their customers. Consumer Reports does this very well. They stress the fact that they don't sell advertising and that therefore, their only aim to please their only customer by providing unbiased information.<p>Most other media have a hard-time selling non-bias because they're not really in the non-bias business. They want to have it both ways: they want to sell unbiased news to readers while at the same time pitch their readers on behalf of their other customers, vendors. To do this they have to sell (perhaps implicitly) their readers on the proposition that bias doesn't matter. At this point most media companies have already lost the customers who understand and value unbiased news. The customers that are left are really looking for entertainment.<p>If this analysis is right, you should not expect to see the most successful ad-supported news media be unbiased.",1259696357

The closest thing I can think of is getting randomly upvoted on HN whenever I happen to mention my gender in a post, or similar.<p>If anything, guys in tech -- the real techies, that is -- are so horribly bad at talking to women that it's being viewed as an alien from outer space that's offputting, not being viewed as a pair of walking boobs.

Density of lead is around 650 lbs/ft3. Let's say you have a big ship, a mile in diameter.

Instead of taking the top n candidates and breeding them randomly, I kept all of them (NUM_STATES 200 and KEPT_STATES 200), but weight them according to score.  So the best scores have the highest chance of passing their DNA down to the next generation, but the occasional loser gets lucky too.<p>Mutation is also weighted, so the most likely number of mutations is zero, but it's possible to have up to 4.  Increasing this value made the performance go down, but it's also possible that there is no way to get to a solution by incrementally tweaking a decent attempt.  Which could explain why I'm stuck at 12.<p>There are a few optimizations that may or may not make a difference, for instance in the scoring function.  I think the pick_best_states function was not actually picking the best states.  If you had two states with the same score, the first one is kept, but the next one is not.  I fixed this.  The stupid thing is, with NUM_STATES and KEPT_STATES at 200, it's basically an n^2 sort now.  I never bothered to improve that.<p>Finally, compiled with -O3 and let 'er rip.",1259695423

I like my science to be less ideologically-driven from the start.<p>Also I think the science has not shown that we're drastically affecting the earth's normal cycles, which can be drastic & on on a very short time frame themselves (witness the mini-ice ages of 400-500 years ago, and also witness medieval warming (which this particular set of folks tried to suppress but were corrected about)).",1259694209

The little scanner in the video is plugged into the headphone port of an iPod Touch. I'm assuming that this port also accepts microphone input (like the iPhone port) and that the scanner device just transforms the magnetic strip data into sonic frequencies the software understands to be able to ""read"" the credit card into the app? Neat.",1259694164

The hardware is almost a gimmick to push what is otherwise a potentially powerful service.<p>The theory behind this app is that individuals are now empowered to take credit cards for anything they previously would have had to take a cash or check for, which is increasingly important in our society where credit cards are becoming the normal way to pay for things.<p>As for the hardware, it's a pretty old trick.

Why would I convert their CSS to SASS to get the same result in the end?<p>Templates are a different story -- that's where the design and the functionality meet.  I do convert the final comps to templates and if necessary the templates back into static code to repeat the process (rarely necessary, but it happens).  This is a necessary evil.  Why would I want to perpetuate that evil in CSS as well?",1259694117

At its core, they should be playing hard ball.  We're becoming a society that just expects everything to be free (in price) and as cheap as possible.

970386,comment,969646,970009,0,0,lmkg,,,"In reply to your first point, about women not wanting to go into CS, I would say that in itself is the problem. Programming (or other hard sciences) could be a very rewarding career path, but they're socialized to self-select away from it. I don't think that CS as a field is necessarily lacking an important female perspective[1], but I do think that individual women may be missing an opportunity for the wrong reasons. The self-selection aspect should not be taken as a lack of problem, but rather a characterization of the problem as having more subtle causes.<p>[1] Although, there may be truth in the idea that software is written for/from a male perspective, meaning that it doesn't suit women's needs as well... whatever those needs are. Yeah, I'm ambivalent about this point, but I don't outright reject it.<p>PS I also highly recommend reading The Mismeasure of Woman by Carol(?) Tavris. It provides very clear concrete, statistical, and anecdotal explanations of how and why a woman's experience differs from a man's, and the consequences of the man's experience being an implicit standard. Despite being woman-focused, the book is also pretty rational and balanced about the potential of reverse-discrimination, and does a pretty good job of noting problems without demanding specific fixes.",1259694080

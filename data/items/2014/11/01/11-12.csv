Although it is a commercial product, it&#x27;s from a time when details on hardware programming were more freely available and regular users were encouraged to write programs too, which is very empowering. Doing that is a great feeling that makes it seem like you really do own the computer you bought; contrast this with the locked-down, highly complex, and multilevel-abstracted environment of modern computing devices that strictly divides users and &quot;developers&quot;, almost making them enemies of each other.<p>I think the fact that new C64 demos are still being written with impressive new effects, despite the limitations of the hardware, is a great demonstration of how far human creativity can go toward solving problems, as opposed to the &quot;throw more hardware at it&quot; mentality.",1414843085

Apple builds its apps on private APIs, while third parties must build their apps on inferior public APIs. Apple gets to create and use new UX, while third parties must wait until Apple uses it first. On Android, Google&#x27;s apps use the same APIs my own apps use.</i><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s called building a stable API. Not all APIs are ready for external consumption. Apple, since it controls the APIs and their internal apps can safely build on early APIs, since they can release in sync with any changes. Third party developers not so much. This is not some conspiracy or Apple &quot;advantage&quot;, this is software development 101.<p>In fact, instead of third parties &quot;having to build their apps on inferior public APIs&quot;, iOS&#x27;s public APIs are way better, and offering more than Android APIs.<p>><i>That&#x27;s funny. Apple copied wholesale the Android save and restore data bundles model that was in Android from the beginning, and said, &quot;Look at our battery-saving multitasking.&quot;</i><p>After Android emerged a full year later than the iPhone, and with the same UI and interaction model (while just days prior to the iPhone&#x27;s introduction Google only had keyboard sporting, classical-looking smartphone models as their Android mockups), there&#x27;s nothing that can be said that iOS &quot;copied&quot; from Android with a straight face. iOS/iPhone was there first, and it set the way for all the major features. Heck, Android lead members even admitted so.<p>That Android, years after coming into life as an iOS clone, pioneered a few things here and there (most of which Apple worked on in secret anyway for years, like battery saving techniques) is not that impressive.<p>><i>Even more than the private APIs issue, this is what made me jump on the Android bandwagon early on and makes it hard for me to understand why a person who enjoys software development would choose the iOS ecosystem.</i><p>Because there are more things to enjoying software development than &quot;hating closed systems&quot; or not wanting to part with $100.",1414840402

You can still use Google Apps with it (Google for work now?).<p>That being said, I think it&#x27;s a bit unfair to say companies won&#x27;t lift a finger to help protect their users usernames. On the technical security level, many companies put a lot of effort into things like 2F, general internet security, etc. In particular Google, but also Dropbox, github, and others. On the service level (i.e. what happens when you have to talk to someone) everybody could probably improve quite a bit. OTOH that&#x27;s costly and would ultimately need to be paid for by the customers somehow.<p>On the legal level, there isn&#x27;t really anything these companies could do for you. If you do not own a trademark for your chosen domain name (account name, page name, ...), you&#x27;ll lose it to someone who does [0].

If we didn't bring them into the world as food, would they have existed in the first place? Is is it better that they existed for a shorter period of time than not at all? Do the animals we eat for food have the capacity of preferences? Due to their brain capacities, is it more humane to eat fish and birds versus pigs and cattle?",1290499192

The response was overwhelmingly positive and generous.<p>I emailed the founders of two companies I've been following for a while (one a former YC company) simply introducing myself and asking for advice on what I should do to put myself in a position so that they might want to hire me in the  future.<p>The response I got from both was more than overwhelming.  One responded to my first email within an hour with detailed explanations of what I should be doing and what I can do in the future.  Furthermore, he responded to each of my follow up questions almost instantly after receiving them.<p>The second responded offering to set up a skype call in the next couple of weeks to talk over my questions with me more thoroughly.<p>These are both guys whom I have to assume are insanely busy and get far more important emails than random cold calls every day.<p>I feel like a lot of people don't take approaches like this and don't reach out to people because they have the same assumptions I did.  I guess all I can say is, never underestimate the generosity and outgoingness of the entrepreneurial community.",1290499055

1932964,comment,1932821,1932930,0,0,dorkitude,,,"Java tools are often for-enterprise, and the best of them are often for-purchase.<p>Tweaking a Java library is huge PITA, because Java is soooo code-heavy.  I estimate Java leads to ~10x as many lines of code when compared to Ruby or Python for basic libraries like API clients.  The IDE-reliance inherent in that culture removes many of the immediate incentives of code minimalism, and as such, you often find insanely convoluted libraries that literally have more classes than pieces of functionality.<p>Java's great if you're not in a hurry, or if your organization is infected with enough bureaucracy that the added bureaucracy in the code won't even make a dent in your already-dismal efficiency, or if you need to ""get fat"" (i.e. ""hire a bunch of college grads and burn them out"") and you don't mind dropping your talent density to near-zero figures.<p>With all talent being equal, give me a Python or Ruby shop over a Java shop any day, and I'm certain they will be significantly more productive, day in and day out.",1290498999

Forgive my use of the word to describe your position but perhaps you'll see what I had in mind when I did.<p>>I just said there are clearly cultural differences across races [meaning in the US today.]<p>So a lower class black participates in the same culture as an upper middle-class black? (anecdotal: I sure as hell don't) A lower-class white shares culturally with middle-class whites? In ""attitudes towards education, ambition, work and success"" no less (which is what your brought up cultural difference with regard to)? Perhaps the wording of your claim is leading my astray, but as it's written it's not very defensible and can only make sense once your inject it with a vertical register, socio-economic status, good ol' fashioned class relations.<p>>There are plenty of black people, for example, who will openly talk about this, including Bill Cosby and Thomas Sowell, among others.<p>Irrelevant.<p>>Although on a separate point I'd say it's not 100% proven that somehow all failure or imperfection on the part of black Americans, to take one just group, is solely the fault of feeling oppressed, or having suffered from a history of oppression or being a minority or ""on the bottom."" Some of it may just be due to the results of personal choices and personal behavior and willpower.<p>Personal choices? Personal behavior and willpower? Sure. Now are you willing to scale that explanation uniformly across an entire sector of the population? Unless you're going to defend something very improbable, you have to explore more comprehensive causalities. The latter don't have to directly do with anything, but can and do mediate every other intersecting relation of cause.",1290498998

It was not too long ago (when endowments were higher) that colleges and universities would spend millions building luxurious dorms, athletic facilities, and campus centers. Expansion was a means to attract students, gain prestige and make press. Also, included in the mix was state of the art academic buildings, faculty recruitment and merit aid increases - all of which meant that colleges strove to grow better year after year.<p>The dark side of growth, however, was that students paid a high price for these luxuries.

Animals are killed every day so that we can live a better life. It's not a big deal. Get over it or get off the grid.<p>I hope you don't drive on roads, or use anything produced by the petrochemical industry.<p>Hell, somewhere between your computer and HN a switch, server or piece of critical infrastructure is powered by burning dead animals. Or perhaps, it's just the plastic sheath on your ethernet cable that was made from petrochemicals.<p>I hope you're seriously considering refraining from using the internet because of the animals that were killed to make it.<p>Also, have you <i>EVER</i> considered how many field animals die to produce vegetables? You think a combine cares if there is a mouse in the way? Now, lets say you rely on a good shipped by trucking, train or ship, well then odds are somewhere along the line something was diesel powered, as we all know most diesel comes from oil fields, oil to the best of our knowledge contains dead animals.<p>If you're living you're consuming dead animals. Stop feeling bad about it and start enjoying the taste of meat. They died so you can live. It's the way of life, you think a tiger ponders the morality of eating a human?<p>Not eating meat is basically the sorriest excuse for making a difference I've seen, it's basically on par with believing recycling makes a difference. It's a small step to take with the aim of moralizing to everyone else how big of a difference you're making. Also, how many animals had to die because of habitat loss to make that nice house you're living in?<p>Meat may be murder, but so what?

There are many eastern religions, such as Buddhism and Jainism, that encourage various forms of veganism (not all of them necessarily healthy diets) in their monastic orders.<p>However, I think you are fairly liberally type casting vegans as single issue people. I would argue most vegans probably know about where their food comes from than you, as well as the affects that other parts of their lifestyle have on the environment.<p>From my own personal experience, I know there is exactly one vegan organic standard (which is the VON's ""Stockfree"" certification a sub-certification of British Soil association's UK-5 standard). That means if I eat organic produce living in the US a large amount of the fertilizer used is probably of animal origin. However, I'm between the rock and the hard place because I either choose harm the environment (and animals in other ways) or accept that some of the organic fertilizer will be manure. I didn't set up the system it isn't my fault. However I will choose to opt-out where-ever I sensibly can.<p>In my experience people become vegan for a variety of reasons, but most of those reasons are because they are conscientious, caring people. Like all groups there are a vocal minority who wish to harass other who disagree with them, but I don't like be tarred with that brush any more than you like being accused of murder.",1290497790

The presentation seems to be aimed at the sort of entitled mindset that believes employers will _just_know_ that they deserve 40k fresh out of college. Whether you have skills or not, if all you do is write your bachelors degree and some dot-points on your resume, you're not going to get much credit from employers.<p>Of course, as your skills go up, the chance that you'll get credit for them increases. Truly world class skills would market themselves. The point, however, is that there _is_ an independence between your skills and employers perception of them. It's not always going to be obvious to an employer that you can provide them with value.<p>It's not enough to simply have skills. It's necessary to demonstrate them, to get them out there. The techniques the presenter outlines might be familiar to someone who has done some reading on the general subject, but to the sort of entitled mindset that the presentation seems to be directed at, they mightn't be so obvious.

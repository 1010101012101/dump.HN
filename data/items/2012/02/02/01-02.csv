I was clear for day one that Mark knew he was onto something and that he would be willing to walk away from the table. When you have the capability to do that you set the terms. After possible the first round he no longer was in absolute need of capital. He had the users and could have chosen the slow growth option. After MySpace did themselves in, he was holding all the cards because the competition was then well in the rear-view after that event.",1328147973
3541091,comment,3540569,3540569,5,0,fragsworth,,,"Zynga's strategy is probably not sustainable. Hear me out:<p>The company that made the original game normally has enough time on the market to accumulate most of the users that are worth accumulating via open-market advertisements. It is likely that they hit ""market saturation"" prior to Zynga being able to clone the game.<p>Zynga has a massive existing userbase. When they clone an existing title, they're able to cheaply migrate some portion of their existing users over to the new title through cross-promotion. This is an effective way to retain users, but there is a significant problem: The original company (probably) already hit market saturation. The result, for Zynga, is that they can't really use this cloned game to grow their existing userbase. They can only use it to retain some users.<p>Fortunately for the original company, they aren't hurt all that much by Zynga's strategy - as long as they had enough time on the market before their game was cloned, the net effect of Zynga cloning their game isn't all that negative. The users that play Zynga's version tend to already have been Zynga users, and would only ever have played the Zynga game.<p>Unfortunately for Zynga, if this is their company vision, they will never grow their userbase. They will only ever struggle to keep hold of their existing users. They need to take risks and build unique, interesting games or they will face a slow death.",1328147959
3541090,comment,3540679,3540985,8,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"Putting a really big DRAM cache right next to the CPU would not actually help all that much. The reason DRAM is so slow is because selecting, sensing and amplifying is slow, not because it's far away. It's still so far away just because adding 30% bus latency doesn't sting enough to bring it closer.<p>If you want to reduce latency, what you want is SRAM (expensive), or one of the experimental memory technologies that scales to SRAM-like latencies. The most immediate candidate is T-Ram, which has access latency of <2x 6T-SRAM, is nearly as dense as DRAM, and is presently on the roadmap for mass production for the 32/22nm GlobalFoundries processes.<p>Putting DRAM on-package or on-die would give nice boosts to bandwidth. It could really help integrated graphics.",1328147953

Yeah, Zynga's success does show that distribution counts for the majority of gaming success but you say it like what they're doing is okay. That came off to me like ""Yeah they steal, but whatever it's the distribution that counts anyway so it doesn't matter who they rip off"". At least that's what I heard. Is Zynga really deserving of what they have? I don't care how much logic and economics you throw at the issue, we're dealing with people here. People aren't markets, margins, profits, distribution channels or anything else. They're flesh and blood and what Zynga does is not okay. The guys who they're ripping off are the ones deserving of all the money Zynga is making off them.<p>This doesn't <i>just</i> indicate that great game design takes a back seat to distribution, it promotes the idea that the fine line between plagiarism and inspiration doesn't exist and that they're one and the same. Businesses that operate like Zynga aren't new but what's new, at least to me, is seeing such a business, despite the criticism it gets, become such a media darling. They had Pinkus on the Today show or some other morning show the other day making him look like he's some genius mythical Zuckerberg type. Businesses with the rip off model are often successful as there's a sucker born every minute but I've never seen one get praise like Zynga as if they're doing something that's one iota innovative.",1328147538

It's not a ""design"" constraint any more than OOP is. It's an <i>implementation</i> constraint. In the case of OOP I think people confuse those notions because  they conflate designing a system with designing class heirarches. But OOP doesn't have anything to do with classes. A system is object oriented when the state is private, objects communicate by passing messages and methods are late-bound. Similarly, you don't really design a system to be RESTful, you simply commit to the idea that you never know — a priori — what methods will be available on a resource. You determine them by asking the object and those methods are only valid as long as the cache-control header says they are. Just about everything else follows from that.<p>> the point is that the network imposes limitations and you often need a domain-specific design to get around them<p>That's why REST emphasizes caching, stateless communication, the appropriate use of status codes, and the appropriate use of VERBs (idempotent vs non).<p>> for example, HTTP is awful for soft real-time applications.<p>I wouldn't write an OS kernel in Ruby either.",1328146803

They ascribe this to the fact that the IDF in particular and Israeli society in general tend to disregard hierarchy and encourage challenges to authority.<p>If the army's culture were different, its effects on the Israeli start-up scene would likely not be positive.",1328146576

Moving state to the client can result in inconsistencies across clients as each one makes changes.<p>Locking data to prevent this is a usability problem.  Pushing changes to the each client is a partial solution, but then you're faced with the users watching the data change in front of them, without any action on their part.  This is especially a problem in complex applications with multistep workflows.<p>Perhaps it is outside the scope of this series, since this appears to be focused on the technical aspects of using Backbone rather than application design.  But a discussion of patterns that overcome these problems would be very useful.",1328144799

The gist is this, on an hourly engagement (most of my work) the client will pre-pay for hourly blocks of time - say 100 hours at a time and I will bill time against that block of hours. If it runs out, work stops until it is filled back up. If the work completes and funds are still in the account I cut a check back to the client.<p>I use Freshbooks for invoicing but this model does not fit, theirs seems to be based around the 'invoice after services' model. I am looking for a system that dove tails well with the retainer based model where the invoice is less the focus and it is more about the balance of the retainer account.<p>Any one know of a service that fits?",1328144401

They aren&#x27;t trying to make an unbreakable system, they&#x27;re trying to make a deterrent. If they had made the detection method too complicated, it could lead to false rejections and that would ultimately be more costly. They just needed a method that they can prove in court that a third party is using to defeat their DRM. This is the equivalent to ROT-13 encryption.",1418180353

Design errors made by Blizzard cannot be dismissed.<p>Idra leaving the game because he hated it. Sea lasting about a week on Liquid before going back to play BW.

These are not signs of a beautiful game.<p>With Legacy of the Void alpha reveal Blizzard themselves have addressed many of existing design concerns.

8727422,comment,8723693,8725601,0,0,dmix,,,"> So replacing a specific library has to wait until the next complete push of Android.<p>I know for a fact (because I&#x27;ve created my own ROM) that Android&#x27;s OTA system is fully capable of updating single components. And the update the user downloads is not the entire ~200mb Android ROM, it could be a small 1mb zip file that only updates a specific library. For example a security release updating only OpenSSL.<p>Why Google doesn&#x27;t do this and prefers using a point release system - instead of rolling releases - is a complicated question. One that I&#x27;d be curious to hear the reasoning for.<p>One UX consideration is that the users need to reboot their phone since the OTA update writes to the /boot partition and then triggers a reboot into recovery mode. Then recovery mode will automatically install the new update (preserving all user data) then boots back into the OS. This would be annoying to users if they had to do it often.<p>But the same behavior exists for any OS updates on OSX, linux, etc.",1418179768

It&#x27;s okay to blow these same people up in the battlefield, but god forbid we throw water on them and put them in a slightly cold room?<p>One was self-referential:<p>> I&#x27;d be pretty happy if HN could muster the same uniform moral outrage about rape jokes involving non-terrorists (e.g. gamergate) as it has shown in response to my comment about terrorists being cold.<p>One was in response to &#x27;reitanqild saying: &quot;Most of us would much rather prefer to be shot dead or blown up in a split second than being even <i>slightly tortured</i> and locked up indefinitely.&quot;<p>> Throwing water on someone and leaving them in a 59-degree room is worse than shooting them dead? Keeping someone awake until they hallucinate is worse than shooting them dead? Really?<p>The cold room and the sleep deprivation were in response to the &quot;slightly tortured&quot; part of that comment.<p>At no point did I ever try to make the argument that &quot;what the CIA did wasn&#x27;t so bad because they just put people in cold rooms.&quot; I actually have no interest in trying to convince anyone that what the CIA did wasn&#x27;t bad. This is not an issue that people are going to approach rationally.

8727416,comment,8723024,8725494,0,0,e12e,,,"> In digital content, &quot;the fold&quot; has its own meaning<p>Does it? I suppose it could mean &quot;outside the first screen&quot;, as in on the next &quot;card&quot; in a mobile &quot;slide deck&quot;, or &quot;below the scroll&quot; in a browser (that is: content that is on the virtual page, but outside the viewport).<p>But my impression is that people are <i>not</i> using it like that -- in which case &quot;the fold&quot; is probably a poor/wrong metaphor/term?<p>> This is one of many digital design that are inspired by terms from print, like &quot;page&quot; (which also is inappropriate for digital if you take the print meaning literally.)<p>Not really. In (magazine/newspaper) print, a page typically holds various assorted content. Especially so for the front page. Now, with scrolling, &quot;page&quot; will often mean &quot;all of a document at a given URL&quot; -- and that would typically be different from a print page. In that case &quot;viewport&quot; would be more appropriate. But I think the confusion really lies in the print world: &quot;page&quot; means both &quot;what the user can see at any one time&quot; (viewport) and &quot;largest section of connected layout&quot; (the physical page).<p>> And, anyway, laptop users do fold their computers in half, but that&#x27;s a completely different thing.<p>But mobile users did, at least for a while. There were/are some phones with a small screen on the back of the &quot;flip&quot;. AFAIK all of these only have enough real-estate for a small icon and simple scrolling text message though. And aren&#x27;t really meant for showing a preview of some random web page, but rather to alert the user to incomming email etc.",1418179674

The problem is that most elementary teachers aren&#x27;t up to explaining these more advanced math concepts (lots of them have trouble with advanced middle school level math), and instead focus on just basic arithmetic.<p>This does a huge disservice to our children, because kids soak these topics up when well explained, and seem to really enjoy the learning (which is often hands on). I spent a fair bit of time in university (where I studied math) volunteering along with a professor to teach lectures to young children (1st-4th grade in the US) about math.<p>I honestly wish we could just accept that mathematics is as much of a specialized language/topic as foreign languages, and get specialist teachers starting early on.",1418179105

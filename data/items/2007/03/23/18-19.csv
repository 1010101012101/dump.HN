Simply identifying market opportunity (i.e. how do you make money)""</i><p>I think at least it's a valuable exercise to imagine that you're not going to have a free version of your product. Imagine that you're actually <i>selling</i> it to a real customer. Would you be embarrassed to say it costs money? How would support work differently? How about uptime? Who would actually pay?<p>I'm not sure that's necessary in all cases, but it does seem to raise a lot of interesting questions useful for self-examination.\n",1174675542

5958,comment,5957,5957,0,0,dfranke,,,"The discussion in the ""What's the lowest offer you'd take"" thread gave me an interesting idea for a related question:<p>Suppose you've just been accepted to the SFP.  In addition, you have someone else offering each founder $N to turn down YC and abandon the startup.  You're allowed to go straight on to starting some other startup, but you're not allowed to work on any related idea or work with any of your current cofounders.  What's the lowest value of N you'd take?<p>I have three things going for me and my startup right now: a good idea, a great cofounder, and a uniquely low opportunity cost because I'll be graduating from college right before I start.  Together, I value those things at about $250k.  Having YC's offer in hand would increase that but only by maybe $100k, because I reason that if I can get accepted once, then I can probably get accepted a second time given a similarly good idea and cofounder.",1174675389

Try not being so defensive, sometimes the last thing you want to hear is just what you need.<p>You may be discouraged, but I don't think he's <i>trying</i> to do that. He just happens to agree with almost everyone I've heard from on this issue. Feel free to prove yourself as an exception, no one has said it's impossible.<p>Maybe collecting a list of single-founder companies would be inspirational for you?

Apologies if my attitude seems overly harsh (not intended to be).<p>Also, here's a direct quote from Paul Graham:<p>""This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in startups with only one founder. Practically every successful company has at least two. And because startup founders work under great pressure, it's critical they be friends.""",1174674515
5950,comment,5940,5940,0,0,volida,,,"""Teams vs. Individuals: YC leans strongly towards selecting startups that two or more founders. I'm a strong advocate of this myself as I believe that having two or more founders in an early-stage startup significantly improves the chances of success. By explicitly stating this requirement, YC forces early-stage entrepreneurs to find co-founders. This is a good thing as if there's a problem with finding a co-founder, that's an early signal of a problem (either with the founder or the idea or both), and everyone's better off knowing that sooner rather than later.""<p>\nI am trying to understand why he is trying to discourage single founders in contrast with YC that is not doing that. If someone is determined to commit to his ideas, then not founding a co-founder will not discourage him. And its better than leaving your ideas completely. <p>We know it's hard more than anyone who hasn't experienced it. I just don't understand the absolute attack towards single founder from his side. He should know that if someone decided to take the single founder route he is absolute aware of the effects of the choice. <p>And if it's hard to be single founder, its better than finding someone who you are not aware of his real character and passions.<p>I dont like it that in order to differentiate themselves or not, from the fear of copying themseleves  (some ""journalists"") and from saying the exact\nword of someone, they use some point of reference to later exagerate it.

5949,comment,5940,5945,0,0,dshah,,,"Well, I could argue (and will) that the two are not mutually exclusive.  Startups that think at least a wee bit about how to build a business may earn themselves more runway and hence have higher chances of ultimately building something users will love.",1174673090

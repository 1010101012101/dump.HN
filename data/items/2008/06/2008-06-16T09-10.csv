Having a standard build VM which nobody could rebuild from scratch brings its own set of problems.",1213610080

If they cannot find a system that allows authors to make a reasonable amount of money, they're not going to last long considering that it's much more convenient and less stressful to just publish your book online, if you're gonna do it for free (and is just as good for your reputation if you do it right).",1213609411

If you make your product really well, people will market it for you, because they like it and want to tell their friends.",1213608962

218511,comment,218425,218462,0,0,babul,,,"I agree. In my past experience I have found it actually better to build all the domain elements (model) first based on command line usage, as it more clearly and accurately defines the problem (focus is not lost on GUI issues), and <i>then</i> work on GUI development.<p>This allows very loosely coupled yet highly cohesive systems to be easily built. The main problem I face with others who adopt a GUI-driven development method (which has many merits of course) is they start to confuse elements/logic/tiers and tie things together too much at too early a stage and hence is is no separation of concerns and elements making systems harder to change/scale/iterate-upon etc.",1213608621
218510,comment,218226,218226,0,0,DougBTX,,,"> I think ""downvoting"" is against evolution<p>As a side note, evolution requires killing the weak.<p>When people say they want HN to go back to the Start-up News days, or Reddit to go back to the Lisp days, they are saying that they don't want the site to evolve, they want it to stay the same. But they do evolve, the strongest ideas are those that reproduce in the most minds - those which are the lowest common denominator.",1213608200

Lending institutions who are part of the Credit Crunch typically borrow the cash that they lend from third parties. Since angels don't invest on credit, they're not affected.",1213607613

McKinsey is an up-or-out market environment where associates &quot;sell&quot; their services to partners and partners make bank by themselves owning a book of business. It&#x27;s far more entrepreneurial than software consulting.<p>If you want to do technical work that has the compensation dynamics of McKinsey, you need to (a) hyper-specialize in something valuable and (b) own your own practice.",1420905469
8866991,comment,8865807,8866982,0,0,viiralvx,,,"Yeah . . . I&#x27;m wondering how best to fix that. The problem with rendering iFrames is that once you hit 100, it gets CPU intensive and laggy, so I decided to delete older items under the assumption that the user was done with them. Thus, by limiting it to 50 items onscreen at once, it increases performance. Maybe pagination would have been better, I just didn&#x27;t want to force users to click more than they had to.",1420905387

Together we get to explore the surprising details of living as adults in the US, which builds up even more shared experiences between us that other couples to not share. I think that bond has made it much easier to remain friends as well as partners, as every week we get to experience new things together.<p>It does make it hard to find others who share our detached sense of humor, but usually we do with international college students, who definitely appreciate the differences.",1420905339

Impactful specializations would have included kernel-level systems programming, compiler theory, maths, maybe some kinds of networking or finance.

42 is index register from r8-r15
44 is 2nd register from r8-r15<p>==================<p>I wrote this quiz.<p>64-Bit Assembly Quiz<p>1) In 64-bit mode, how many bytes are always pushed?<p><pre><code>        PUSH    12
        PUSH    EAX
</code></pre>
2) What happens to the upper 32-bits?<p><pre><code>        XOR     EAX,EAX
        MOV     EAX,0x12345678
        MOV     EAX,0x80000000
</code></pre>
3) How do you set FS or GS values?<p>4) If FS points to current task record, what&#x27;s wrong with this instruction?<p><pre><code>        MOV     RAX,U64 FS:[TSS_SOME_MEMBER]
</code></pre>
5) Which instruction takes more bytes?<p><pre><code>        MOV     RAX,U64 [R8]
        MOV     RAX,U64 [R13]
</code></pre>
6) Are these the same number of bytes?<p><pre><code>        MOV     RAX,1234
        MOV     R8,1234
        MOV     EAX,1234
</code></pre>
7) True or False<p><pre><code>  a) You can access the lowest byte of RAX.

  b) You can access the lowest byte of ESI.

  c) You can access the second-to-lowest byte of RAX.

  d) You can access the second-to-lowest byte of ESI.
</code></pre>
8) How do you call a subroutine at 0x10,0000,0000 from code at 0x00,0010,0000?<p>9) How much faster is a REL32 call instruction compared to a software interrupt 
or SYSCALL?<p>10) How long does an IN or OUT instruction take on a 1GHz machine and on a 3GHz 
machine?<p>11) How do you push all 16 regs?<p>12) Should you put the regs in a TSS?<p>13) You can have 4K or 4Meg pages in 32-bit mode.  You can have 4K or what size 
pages in 64-bit mode?<p>14) On a fresh CPU with an empty TLB, how many memory accesses (page tables) 
does it take to access one virtual address?<p>----<p>TempleOS identity-maps everything, all the time, so the usual convention of 
upper memory being for kernel does not apply.  It uses physical addresses, 
basically.  It puts all code in the lowest 2-Gig memory range so that it can use 
the CALL REL32 instruction, the fastest.  It never changes privilege levels or 
messes with page tables, once it is up-and-running.<p>----<p>ANSWERS:<p>1) All stack pushes and pops are 64-bits.<p>2) The upper 32-bits are set to zero.<p>3) To set FS or GS, you use WRMSR to write a model specific reg.  See 
IA32_FS_BASE and SET_FS_BASE.<p>4) Displacement addressing is now RIP relative, so RIP would be added to 
TSS_SOME_MEMBER.  (Useless)<p>5) The R13 instruction takes one more byte because it is like REG_RBP in the 
ModR.<p>6) The R8 instruction needs a REX byte prefix to specify upper-8 reg.<p>7) You can access the lowest byte of any reg.  You can access AH but not the 
second-to-lowest byte of ESI.<p>8) To call a subroutine farther than 2 Gig away, you put the address into RAX, 
then CALL RAX.<p>9) CALL REL32 is significantly faster.  See ::/Demo/Lectures/InterruptDemo.CPP.<p>10) IN or OUT instructions happen at a fixed speed based on the original ISA bus 
clock.<p>11) PUSHAD is not available for 64-bit mode, so you do it by hand.<p>12) The TSS is no longer used to hold the task state because there are 16 regs 
and they are 64-bits, not 32-bits.  I guess Intel decided doing it by hand was 
better than TSSes.<p>13) 64-bit mode has 4K or 2Meg page size.<p>14) For one access, there are 3-4 levels of page tables plus the location 
itself.",1420905173

8866980,comment,8866162,8866162,0,0,jws,,,"Just yesterday I was staring at some of my go code thinking that channels are the &quot;goto&quot; of concurrency. You can make just about anything with them, but to understand code you have to read it all, hold it in your head, and reason about all possible outcomes. In the &#x27;60s that&#x27;s how flow of control was done. As the &#x27;70s went by &quot;structured programming&quot; came in and exotic things like <i>while</i> loops, <i>switch</i> statements, and functions that you could only enter at the top (so limiting!) became the norm.<p>This post proposes a level of abstraction to take a common 10 line idiom and abstract it to a word. I&#x27;d much rather read code with the abstraction. (In this case it is clean to read, but there are many complicated patterns in common use involving auxiliary chans for cancellation and timeouts.) Sadly, this is where it collides with the go language designers. Go is anti-abstraction by design. If you don&#x27;t like that then you descend into <i>interface{}</i> hell and manual runtime type checking, or change languages, or just repeat yourself a lot and pray you get the fiddly bits right each time.",1420904696

(Although one could argue that if certain flavors of feminism succeeded they would become much less lopsidedly male problems because a side effect would be that women would represent a higher percent of war casualties and job fatalities, but I&#x27;m not sure anyone would call that in itself progress.) Feminism isn&#x27;t about fixing all the things that are wrong with the world, it&#x27;s about fixing the problems that hold women back, which btw are not just about things like c-level board positions.<p>Women are less likely to get proper followup care after heart attacks, for instance, even though they experience them nearly as frequently as men. Sexual assault and rape still affect women at such a higher rate than men it&#x27;s staggering. Women are also far more likely than men to experience crippling depression (how much of that is due to biological vs cultural factors is unknown), although men tend to be more successful at committing suicide. And the growing restrictions on abortion access WILL cause women&#x27;s deaths just as they did before Roe v Wade.<p>There are other movements that address other problems with the world (pacifism, labor rights, and more).

WhiteHat executes the &quot;open source the project and make like that&#x27;s an outcome we are happy about&quot; play, using language which --- corroborated a bit by this post --- signals that the project has been abandoned.<p>Several hours later, Google star vulnerability researcher Tavis Ormandy tweets(!) an embarrassing drive-by RCE in Aviator.<p>Hours after that, Justin Schuh from the Chromium security team posts what can best be described as thermonuclear schadenfreude† to his Google+ feed (if you&#x27;re not a vulnerability researcher, you should know that there are major points for style awarded to a meaningful critique of the <i>branding code</i> in a target).<p>In response to all this, Robert Hanson (a very well-known web security guy employed by WhiteHat) writes what I would call an ill-advised and transparently prickly response on WhiteHat&#x27;s blog††, suggesting that WhiteHat has been victimized by their underdog status.<p>I like some of the people involved with WhiteHat, Hanson among them, but I think Aviator was a very bad idea and I am --- if I am honest, and it&#x27;s a bit painful to admit this --- kind of happy it failed in the market.

They compare the average house hold water usages in Israel to the average P/P usage in the PA.
They also make the graphic look like the vast majority of the water is coming from the western aquifer which currently is less than 300 MCM per year.
The abstraction rates that they specified also ignore the actual destination of the water, as they ignore both the fact that Israel pumps water directly to the water system run by the PA and that 60-70% of the Arab residents of the west bank are connected to the Israeli water system and not the one which is run by the PA.<p>While Israel does control nearly 100% of the access to that aquifer and uses it as a political bargaining chip for various agreements and negotiations with the Palestinians it doesn&#x27;t seem to employ a policy that prevents individuals from access to water.<p>P.S.
I also find it odd that they&#x27;ve decided to use the WHO recommended numbers instead of quoting the ones from the UN water report which although isn&#x27;t a fluff peace for Israel does states that a large disparity between the water usage on both sides is oddly due lower usage of showers and lavatories especially in the more nomadic parts of the west bank than is due to lack of access to water.

If the society needs work to be done, it will pay for the work to be done. The people most screwed will be non-working old people who thought that they were retired, but face high inflation due to a lack of young workers, and who can&#x27;t easily get back into the workforce. That&#x27;s not a good thing, but that itself is unlikely to damage <i>the global economy</i>.<p>From a US perspective and a member of the 2nd in a series of Screwed Generations (Millennials, after Xers) I&#x27;m actually OK with this. No one wants Weimar inflation, but wage-driven inflation is often a good thing. Besides, the reason why Japanese young people aren&#x27;t having sex is <i>because they can&#x27;t start their careers</i>. The Japanese economy has been fucked for 25 years and the situation for education young people over there is far worse than in the US. We can&#x27;t buy houses, but many of them can&#x27;t even get stable jobs. I&#x27;m not an expert on Japan at all, but an increased demand for the work that young people can provide seems to be exactly what that economy needs.<p>In other words, the &quot;sexual apathy&quot; was caused by Japan&#x27;s lost quarter-century and, while Japan&#x27;s economic state (and especially its debt) is a threat to the global economy, I don&#x27;t buy the headline because I think the sexual apathy is, quite obviously, a symptom of Japan&#x27;s economic problems and not a cause.<p>On the age pyramid, I do wonder if societies should get rid of the concept of &quot;retirement&quot; (as an entitlement or expectation) wholesale and replace it with a basic income... and I think we should also oppose the need for retirement by more aggressively enforcing anti-ageism policies in the workplace so that people in their 60s and 70s who are able to work and want to do so, can. (I may move to something less remunerative or even unpaid, but I plan on remaining active until I die.) Much of &quot;retirement&quot;, sadly, is involuntary and I&#x27;d like to see that change... but with a Japan-style age pyramid, one might think that societies would be less ageist against the capable older people. When there is a labor surplus, society peels off the young and the old (by forcing the young into unpaid schooling and internships for longer, and becoming ageist against the old as in Hollywood and, more recently, the Valley). When there&#x27;s a shortage, those attitudes change pretty quickly.<p>In sum, I&#x27;d argue that the &quot;sexual apathy&quot; is a symptom of a bad economy. It would be a danger if one believed it to be causative of a positive-feedback loop, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s so. When there are jobless young people, the economic signal is that the society has a surplus of young people... and the producers of 30-years-younger-people (out of self-preservation) hold back. Over the decades, we can expect that (unless there is a collapse of demand in labor, which I find unlikely) to increase wages and eventually normalize. It&#x27;s shitty for a generation of people who don&#x27;t get to start adulthood until their eggs and tadpoles are stale, but it does stabilize.",1420902607

Dave Wagner copied it to his website, and it&#x27;s closer to the original:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/teaching/cs261-f12/misc/if.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/teaching/cs261-f12/misc/if.h...</a><p>Second: in case you&#x27;re impatient (I would be), conceptually, this is what the post is trying to communicate:<p>* Unauthenticated CBC is surprisingly malleable. There are two attacks in here that I thought were &quot;clever&quot;: using totally random CBC block garbling strategically to eat quote characters and synthesize SQL injection (the motivating example for the post, after I pulled this attack off on a real system) and &quot;stuffing&quot; inputs with known plaintext to make rewriting easier.<p>* CBC padding oracles. I would be interested if anyone knows a source outside of academic literature that walked through this attack published prior to 2009.<p>It is not about how to implement single sign-on cookies.<p>The nice thing about posts about cryptographic attacks, as opposed to cryptographic constructions, is that they age pretty well. :)",1420902382

8866874,comment,8865124,8866500,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">Your post contains two unfair criticisms. The article was making a cheap shot at economists. Clearly economists don&#x27;t claim to be experts at predicting &quot;demand&quot; in every possible markets, only at understanding the general principles.<p>Let&#x27;s just say that I wasn&#x27;t at all surprised that it was that one economist in particular - Piketty - who got stuck in the small room. Economists are a cliquey bunch at the best of times and the cool kids do not like Piketty.<p>>Your own criticism is unfair because you think finding any link, no matter tenuous, between a source of funding and some kind of bias, is sufficient to show Economists (but not their critics) are biased.<p>So you think economists are correct that everybody responds to incentives.... but economists don&#x27;t?<p>>First, academic departments are not funded solely by corporate debt.<p>You mean student debt. No, they are not solely, but it is a huge proportion of university funding. Students take out loans. Every university has a keen interest in the terms and availability of those loans because it affects how much their primary customers can pay. This is what led to 20% year on year inflation in college prices.<p>> Second, it&#x27;s unfair to call it &quot;student debt&quot; since students are getting something of value<p><i>facepalm</i><p>> Finally, student debt is a very minor issue in the scheme of things<p>You are really out of touch. There&#x27;s over a trillion dollars of student debt outstanding in the US alone.<p>>Finally, how helpful is it to apply your lens of &quot;rational incentives&quot; to your own side of politics<p>I think it makes sense to look at incentives from every side.<p>>There is no incentive to support mainstream economics outside of academia, because economics is subtle, gives no easy answers, and often identifies no bad guys.<p>As mentioned above, it gives convenient policy proscriptions, therefore it is useful. The presence or lack of &#x27;enemies&#x27; is irrelevant.<p>>It gives clear policy advice in some cases (e.g. free trade follows pretty directly from economic theory) but this advice is often unpopular with special interests.<p>Special interests such as half of the manufacturing industry in the US which was driven into bankruptcy, and the people employed by it who lost their jobs, and the cities such as Detroit that were destroyed by it?<p>Are the working classes a special interest now?<p>&quot;Free trade uber alles&quot; is exactly the type of thing I&#x27;m talking about. It is productively wrong - it benefits corporate profits over the citizens of the country. Among the many things it failed to predict were China&#x27;s meteoric rise and the destruction of the fabric of entire cities in the US.",1420902124

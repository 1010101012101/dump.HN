Other systems programming languages older than C did it properly.&quot;  That doesn&#x27;t apply to the Pascal you speak of, because at the time C arose, Pascal wasn&#x27;t &quot;once you get to a recent enough version supporting dynamic arrays/first-class pointers&quot;.  It was Pascal with the size of an array being part of the type of an array.  That&#x27;s type safety, sure.  But it also means (to use an example that I have personal experience with), if you&#x27;re writing a numerical simulation on a 2D array, and you want to let the user specify how big the mesh is, and then allocate memory to hold the mesh, you have a problem.  You can&#x27;t define a variable-sized array <i>at all</i> in the Pascal of the time.<p>Now try to think about how you&#x27;d write a memory allocator in that.  Good luck.<p>Another example:  We were on an embedded system.  To write to hardware registers, we had to call an assembly-language subroutine.  In C, we would have simply used a pointer to an absolute memory address.<p>This is what C gave you - you could just <i>do</i> things without the language getting in the way.  Yes, you could cut yourself on C&#x27;s sharp edges, whereas Pascal protected you.  But when you needed the sharp edges to cut something, <i>Pascal didn&#x27;t have them</i>, and you were stuck.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t know enough about Algol to meaningfully compare it to C.  The Pascal of the day wasn&#x27;t the answer, though.",1443052781

I know of developments with perhaps one per five, with most not coming with any assigned spots.  But it isn&#x27;t really just the parking.

It&#x27;s a monad. It&#x27;s about 30s of work to implement it if you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Of course, you could implement it as a monad in Javascript as well. It&#x27;d be a neat trick, but you&#x27;d never love it. The reason is simple: you can&#x27;t benefit from monads unless you use them so pervasively that everything will integrate together.<p>And if you do, that integrate together bit works fantastically. People often complain about monads not composing---but I think they&#x27;re often just misinterpreting a rather technical result. <i>Actually</i>, imo, monads compose incredibly well and it&#x27;s astounding when you get used to it.<p>When you use them pervasively, monads mean that you get to &quot;pick your own semantics&quot; on the fly, whenever you want. You can mix and match semantics as is interesting and work with your custom mixes as if they were built into the language.<p>So people, e.g., talk about how it was easy to write STM because of monads.<p>It wasn&#x27;t &quot;because of monads&quot;. Of course STM is a monad and anything which looks even halfway like it in any language will also be a monad no matter how hard you try to avoid it. They&#x27;re &quot;just a pattern&quot;.<p>But when you&#x27;ve got a language which allows you to cut into the &quot;STM monad&quot; exactly and whenever you want, when you&#x27;ve got a hold of the root of the semantics of your language, when you&#x27;ve got programmable semicolons, then there&#x27;s something really special.<p>And without that you&#x27;ve got a couple of years of bickering between standards committees to fix what end up being trivial looking problem.s",1443052514

10269054,comment,10263709,10263709,0,0,geebee,,,"I found the part about coding interesting..<p>&quot;My coding activities were always productive. They either launched a new project or a major change in direction of a project. They also enabled me to have discussions with my team members at a completely different level of detail (to everyone’s enjoyment).&quot;<p>This can be great.  It sounds like it went well.  However, I have personally seen a downside, some potential risks, when the boss &quot;keeps coding&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s why - if the boss is coding but staying off the critical path, this means that the often detailed, difficult implementation work will be delegated to developers who report to the boss.  The old adage that genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration?  Well, the critical path is the perspiration part.  Deadlines, estimates, glaring errors that shouldn&#x27;t have happened and need to be fixed late at night or over the weekend… these are all part of the critical path.  While coding can keep a boss closer to a technical team, it can also create a dangerous illusion, that the boss is still &quot;technical&quot; but insulated from the truly difficult aspects of a technical role.  There is a big, big difference between coding on your own research project and coding under deadline pressure for a system that needs to work.  This is only a risk, not a certainty, as a good manager will recognize this.<p>Perhaps a greater risk, though, is that if the boss gets to play around with new technology and launch projects for the rest of the team to finish off, there&#x27;s a risk that the boss is pretty much eating the frosting of the team&#x27;s dessert but making everyone else eat their vegetables, so to speak.  If you&#x27;re a manager who codes, keep in mind that autonomy and innovation may be key to the motivation and job satisfaction of the people working for you.  This can lead to a very damaging management anti-pattern, where a manager who &quot;keeps coding&quot; essentially uses managerial authority to intercept and filter projects, make the key technical decisions, do the interesting bits that would lead to interesting conference talks, and then delegate the work of actually finishing the product to the team.  This may deprive senior level developers the autonomy that they really were supposed to have on projects.<p>Once again, I want to emphasize that this isn&#x27;t necessarily what happened here, in fact, it sounds like it wasn&#x27;t.  But the passage made me a bit nervous, since I consider this to be something of a management anti-pattern.",1443052353

Those same people then go on to have perfectly friendly and nice conversations (or at least the bar-room-poking-fun equivalent) in other threads.<p>To me, that seems pretty &quot;honest&quot;: you get to see the full range of human emotion that should be statistically-likely for a large group of people to be experiencing at any given moment, rather than just the faces people want to present to the world.<p>Assholish outbursts stick out because they&#x27;re <i>unusual</i> compared to reputational society, but I don&#x27;t think those outbursts are <i>incentivized</i>; they&#x27;re just represented within the corpus at the same rate that people are actually feeling them, rather than hidden away and kept secret.<p>(Though, there might be a bit of a reverse-causation where people visit 4chan <i>when they&#x27;re angry</i> to let off steam, because they know it won&#x27;t affect their reputation.

Or even Pascal (once you get to a recent enough version supporting dynamic arrays/first-class pointers)?<p>I think the situation is not far off from what pjmlp is saying: there were several more or less equally good languages available at the time, and C won by virtue of being in the right place at the right time. There are lots of really nice things about C from a systems point of view, but most languages of the 70s had those too. C was a nice language for the late 70s (not so much today, IMO), but not hugely nicer than its contemporaries.",1443051853

Why would they bother when they could just lock the device down completely?</i><p>Yes. In the actual regs (which nobody seems to read), they suggest a list (&quot;including but not limited to&quot;) a number of mechanisms by which manufacturers may choose to control the portion of their radio software that would impact the validity on their RF testing/validation/compliance results. One of them is signed firmware blobs: to me, that&#x27;s the easiest, cheapest non-invasive method for WiFi module makers that won&#x27;t create a huge compliance burden on the host device manufacturer. You go from having to load an unsigned firmware blob anyway, to a signed one. Which is a huge step in the right direction for firmware security anyway. As for modules which don&#x27;t have blobs but do have the means to create non-compliant emissions just through the driver: it doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a stretch that they could run new region-locked revs of their modules, or at least move those previously adjustable RF parameters/behaviours over to a signed image in a $0.10 SPI EEPROM chip.<p>All of this isn&#x27;t just a PITA for users, it&#x27;s a PITA for the device manufactures as well.<p>Particularly for laptop manufacturers. They could save $5 locking down the entire laptop, something they&#x27;ve never been able to do even when they try, or they could spend the extra $5 and get the module that&#x27;s got a stand-alone certification and only requires them to submit a reference to the module&#x27;s own FCC approval and some demonstration that the gain of the antennas in their product are in-spec.",1443051848

Calling it that implies IMO that there is nothing Google should change about this (maybe the author does not mean that.)<p>Maybe I or the author are missing something here -- why did Google think it was necessary to fetch something that will not be immediately shown to the user nor will it be cached for later?  I can understand the no-caching decision, but then why fetch at all if it&#x27;s not needed <i>now</i>?  Why is 1 hour supposedly short enough for some hypothetical user that wants their spreadsheet&#x27;s embedded images to update automatically, but long enough to not cause damage (wasn&#x27;t long enough in this case)?

Poole has stated that the controversies 4chan was involved in in September had a big negative personal impact, principally dealing with legal threats from celebrities who had their photos leaked on the site. Two other events, which he conspicuously hasn&#x27;t commented on would have unquestionably left scars on his ego and soul: the 8chan exoduses and &#x27;cuckgate&#x27;. I would speculate that these had a far greater negative personal impact on the poor guy than any of the others.<p>Some of the best original content creators and experienced posters migrated to 8ch, taking the mantle from 4chan as the authentic core of internet culture. It&#x27;s evident that at least a couple of years ago, moot took some pride in 4chan&#x27;s leading place in contemporary culture, so to lose the one single point of pride associated with the site must have been a big blow. In his farewell livestream, he responded to repeated questions about 8chan by talking about just about every other &#x27;chan&#x27;-style site on the internet, making the omission very obvious, and indicating it was something he took personally.<p>Second is the situation with one of his friends with whom he was very clearly in unrequited love being revealed and mocked by his own board, giving rise to the current ubiquity of the &#x27;cuck&#x27; meme across the internet (and even spreading into mainstream American politics). I know if I had been in his place, this second event would have been quite devastating not only for destroying my hopes and illusions of love and connection with this girl (she even joined in the mockery in a way), but also for having it be that basis of my ignominious fall from beloved benevolent dictator to a hated object of mockery and derision across the entire internet.<p>When you take these last two events into consideration, I don&#x27;t think anyone could blame him for his decision to quit.

I disagree, especially since &quot;memory safety&quot; may or may not imply protection against aliasing of mutable data. Those nuances I like about Rust probably wouldn&#x27;t exist without the broader scope of safety concerns.</i><p>Memory safety <i>is</i> more fundamental than most other sorts of correctness: it is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for them. If you can&#x27;t assume memory safety, you have no assurances about any other invariants, because any piece of data can be modified/outdated/invalidated at any time in the program&#x27;s execution. (This is especially bad if the compiler will itself assume that memory safety can never happen, and use this undefined behaviour to optimise the program in unintended ways.)<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure that some definitions of memory safety that works for Rust are &quot;there are no use-after-frees&quot; or &quot;the language is type-safe&quot;; all &#x27;other&#x27; problems with memory safety (iterator invalidation, data races, etc.) can be used to violate those and hence need to be outlawed. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s <i>that</i> much wiggle room for what memory safety means, at least in broad terms. In any case, aliasing of mutable data can definitely lead to memory unsafety, and is hence covered/controlled by Rust&#x27;s guarantees. In some ways, it is really the fundamental <i>cause</i> of memory unsafety: remove/control either &quot;aliasing&quot; (e.g. Rust, many GC&#x27;d languages) or &quot;mutable&quot; (e.g. Haskell) and you&#x27;ve got memory safety.<p>Also, Rust definitely doesn&#x27;t only try to help the programmer with memory safety, it&#x27;s just memory safety (and hence type safety) is the form that has hard guarantees. Other forms are generally handled by &quot;lints&quot;/warnings or by building libraries on top of the type system.",1443050385

It works well because the density of residents attract businesses to the outskirts of the park, and in the parks I&#x27;ve seen, they always contain multiple playgrounds, rest areas, sculptures, and exercise equipment for public use. Children play there after school, families gather on weekends, and street markets and street fairs are held in the parks on a regular basis. It is a very efficient use of land to provide both urban density and public space.

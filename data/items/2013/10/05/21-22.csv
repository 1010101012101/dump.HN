That way one button increments, the other decrements<p>- D&D the fireworks component, configure its &quot;shoot this many rockets&quot; to a third color (and clear &quot;shoot rocket); make the counter emit on that color.  Enjoy the fireworks show.<p>- Other components that work well for understanding things are:<p>- ratings widget\n - input widget connected to a map widget will center the map on a place name (although HN will likely exceed the limits on our usage of the OSM server; need to setup another one =()\n - flickr widget can do both topic and location searches<p>Let us know if you have ideas for components we should build (or submit a PR!).<p>The publish button will create &quot;hosted apps&quot; which can be installed on FirefoxOS, Firefox for Android, and incidentally recent builds of Firefox desktop, although the focus for Appmaker is very much mobile apps).",1381010231

6502209,comment,6501362,6501836,2,0,manicbovine,,,"I agree with you, but I think there is at least three related usability issues that made Google Reader less attractive to users. Namely, Google Reader required multiple tools to use efficiently. It also required users to have a basic understanding of RSS feeds. Finally, users had to cope with multiple information formats -- possibly hundreds.<p>Here&#x27;s just one example. Recently, a popular web comic changed its feed to contain thumbnails, links and ads -- requiring the user to click through in order to see the comic. Previously it just syndicated large, readable versions of the comic.<p>That makes a lot of sense to me, but I have to wonder if a less experienced user might feel that something broke. This leads me to consider how it must feel for a &quot;regular user&quot; might feel or react while browsing between feeds and coping with information provided in so many different formats.  Some feeds have pictures, some don&#x27;t, some have complete articles, others just send out links and ads.  Maybe I&#x27;m giving myself a false memory, but I can remember a  feeling of cognitive friction while switching between feeds. I&#x27;m an information junkie and I&#x27;m technologically literate, so I dealt with it.<p>I&#x27;m saying RSS would possibly fair better if the presentation format were standardized across sites. Maybe a simple style manual would unite enough content providers around a single format?<p>The problem is actually worse with the popular content providers. They each seem to redefine the layout of an RSS feed, whereas the long tail of bloggers seem to coalesce around a very basic format.",1381009708

The compiler may fail to vectorize one implementation of an algorithm, while vectorize another, due to details in the implementation of both the code and the compiler.<p>My point is not about vectorization though. Code that uses mostly vectors, math, and function calls has a very direct translation to machine code. I expect all compilers to generate approximately the same machine code for this type of code, assuming vectorization doesn&#x27;t come into play.

Early-model PS3&#x27;s contained a feature called OtherOS which allowed you to run Linux on the console in a way officially supported by Sony.<p>Sony later decided to remove OtherOS support from the console in a firmware update.  While technically optional, the firmware update was required to play online games on the console, or play subsequently produced game discs.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s fine if a hardware manufacturer chooses to remove features from newer models.  OTOH reaching out through the cloud to remove features and cripple models that people have already bought <i>should</i> constitute deliberate fraud against the consumer.  You bought something which was advertised to do X, Y, and Z, the manufacturer deliberately removes the capability to do X after you&#x27;ve purchased it -- it seems like it should be totally illegal for them to do that.<p>If a car dealership owner decides to sell only cars without radios, that&#x27;s their business decision, and it&#x27;s not illegal for them to do business that way.

Walking robots&#x27; primary advantage is in rough terrain, which is only a advantage in marginal areas (if walkers moved with even the same efficiency as (inherently simpler) wheel vehicles, we would still want to confine them to paved roads.

And further, continuous track can things walkers couldn&#x27;t - moving over swamp and other muck. Walkers might, maybe find a marginal use along side other specialized vehicles.

2212316,comment,2211108,2212091,0,0,Natsu,,,"> But if the maps, weapons, quests, characters, sounds, music, rendering style, dialogue, plot, gameplay rules, setting, and even game genre are in some way ""generated""... how can you still have a shared experience?<p>Well, you <i>can</i> do static generation.  You use a known seed and a PRNG to generate stuff that's the same for everyone.  Usually, you do that for background stuff, but some people do it and create big, empty worlds that they then try to fill with other stuff.  But often, it's for background stuff like trees and clouds, where it really doesn't really create a shared experience one way or another.<p>There's also the sort of hybrid approach from Dwarf Fortress, where people can share seeds/worldgen info, but I think you already know about that.  So people can all share that broken embark with the adamantium space elevator, but their fortresses will likely be totally different and have totally different stories.  Maybe one will have their last dwarf go axe crazy while on fire, while another will drop 300+ goblins from the highest z-level all the way down into hell (literally...), or use those crazy weaponized bathtubs they're talking about now.<p>I think there may be some sweet spots in there with handcrafted stories layered atop procedurally generated worlds, but you're right that more work needs to be done on it.",1297582858
2212315,comment,2211955,2212206,0,0,bugsy,,,"Well, maybe it is useful for a lot of people, but not everyone. I went to one of the best universities (famous west coast one) and was really looking forward to it. I had dropped out of high school to go to community college where I did learn many good things like calculus and physics.<p>At the big name university though, I learned almost nothing in the classes.<p>Partly this was because I had been programming and designing and inventing for years, reading journal articles, participating in conferences, selling my software, freelancing, etc. The classes were really backwards and a waste of time.<p>But it was also because the professors at research universities are really lousy at teaching and don't give one whit whether they are effective, assuming they can even be bothered to show up for lecture rather than send their pet grad student/slave boy.<p>Did I learn things outside of classes, like you mention? Absolutely! And I would have learned those things outside of classes by not enrolling in the first place at all.<p>All in all I wasted a bunch of money and a few years of my life that I should have spent starting my next business earlier rather than stalling out while my competitors advanced.<p>Now I am not saying it is useless for everyone.<p>But something like engineering, come on, that stuff can all be learned faster and deeper from practicing it rather than listening to BS from guys that have never released a single finished product in a usable state in their entire lives. What the hell do they know.<p>Medicine, sure, people should go to medical school.<p>Languages? Move to that country. History? Library. Engineering? Build and invent things; then try to manufacture, market and sell them. It goes on and on.<p>When books cost more than a years salary in the middle ages, university made sense.<p>Now I can buy books for $10 on the net that have more info in them than the $200 college textbooks, and I can participate in discussion groups and mailing lists with professionals to learn more of any craft, and I can send emails to the greatest experts in the world and get a response back within hours.<p>The internet community has replaced college. Universities are obsolete. Going into debt for that stuff is just for dumb people.<p>OK, I got a bit off topic there. Let me get back to the post I started with. I absolutely 100% agree that any sort of online learning community that you have to pay for or that is associated with these obsolete institutions called universities will be a substandard way to learn things and should be avoided. I totally agree with that. However, that doesn't mean that online access to community doesn't work. It does! It's just that so-called educators nowadays can't possibly succeed at educating on line when they can't even do it in person. Non-organized independent learning communities, whether they are called that or not (they aren't called that) are in fact a fantastic way to learn and far superior to modern institutions. As learning communities of equals, they are closer to the universities of ancient times when people actually became educated.",1297582841
2212314,comment,2211108,2211855,0,0,intended,,,"Thanks for mentioning it!<p>Dwarf Fortress is brilliant. As much as people like Minecraft, DF really crushed the procedurally generated world bit - and then went on to crush a lot of other concepts.<p>How do I even begin introducing this game?<p>I guess, first the team: The game is the labor of love of 2 brothers; they are genuinely interested in crafting the best world creator there has ever been. \nTill date, I have not heard mentioned any plans to monetize, except vague gestures that some day it will happen. They instead spend hours on how they are going to do things like:\n - ""Bee colonies found on the map can be collected and placed into clay/stone hives""\n""Eggs. They are in the game now. Oh, yeah- dragons get eggs too, along with other assorted animals and thinking beings..""<p>- Those are some of the more tangential things in the release logs. I am not mentioning the release where they added musclature which is tracked for every being, and used to determine combat, nor am I mentioning the release where the world generator is simulating economies to determine where field appear on the world map.<p>Their style of brainstorming is..., interesting. The elder brother will write a short story in a fantasy setting. From the story, major plot points which allowed for the situation to occur will be taken for iteration into the game. Things like ""As to the story's world of eternal darkness, it should be dangerous to walk alone at night. You never know what will happen."" have led to the addition of bogey men that attack you at night if you are adventuring alone.<p>The game itself is complex. Just the procedural world gen is over the top - First the game creates continents, (and recently an ""underworld"" cavern system as well). It also decides the mineral map, and the temperature map. Post creation, the game then erodes the world by running rivers which feed oceans and morph terrain.<p>Once thats iterated over, and an acceptable base created, it begins to populate the world with starting civilizations of elves, humans, goblins and megabeasts. After that, it runs a history and civilization simulator for about a 1050 years. Entire civilizations will rise and fall, cities will be destroyed, legends created, monsters raised into god hood in that time. One of the most famous stories has been of an elf child being kidnapped by the dwarves, being accepted into its society to finally become one of the most famous Kings ever known. You can read the legends of your make believe world, to find out who rose, who fell and what really happened. At this point you have about as much back story as a Tolkien-esque world.<p>Someone dug through their legends and found the epic story of a single dwarf, queen and last of her line, fending of hordes of enemies alone in her castle long after her family had died to the same enemy. The game generated and tracked the life and death of her family, and the rest of her civilization. All of this was made clear through the battle logs and lists of dead after each battle.<p>Once all of this is done, you can actually start to play. All of that detailed and loving world gen was just the preamble to what you as a player are about to do. There are 2 modes, adventure - which is the rogue-like mode, and fortress mode - where you simulate a dwarven outpost.<p>Its hard to talk about the game at the moment without sounding like some sort of super-enthusiast, but it really is everything you would want a fantasy sand-box game to be. Its entirely procedurally created; all stories are emergent from events that happen in the game. All of this is by a game in its alpha, which already has more features than most AAA titles.<p>Did I mention that the entire thing is done in ASCII?<p>Its a Sunday, so if any of you want to have some fun reading - take a look at the hall of legends on the forums - <a href=""http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=41896.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=41896.0</a><p>I suggest at least looking at : <a href=""http://www.nzfortress.co.nz/forum/showthread.php?t=20768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nzfortress.co.nz/forum/showthread.php?t=20768</a><p>The story of the lone dwarf against the world is the legend of Tholtig Cryptbrain, found here: <a href=""http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=42702.msg790500#msg790500"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=42702.msg7905...</a><p>You can also read boatmurdered: <a href=""http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/</a>\nIts a lets play from the something awful forums and is hilarious reading.

Average time to graduate is in excess of five years now. We also read that most college students have to take remedial classes. We also read that 1/3 of college students learn nothing before they graduate, not because they already knew it, but because they learned nothing. OK, stop accepting students that need remedial classes. If you can't add two fractions together or write a 5 paragraph essay at a sixth grade level, you should not be in college end of story. Just stop accepting these people. But do write down the names of the schools they went to, and shut down those schools if there are more than a certain number of these illiterate people graduating. Or why not just return to some vocational education. It's absurd to think that the entire public is college material and people are some sort of uniform robots that can be programmed to do high tech work. A lot of people are not so smart. That's just the way they are. I am tired of having to fix my own plumbing because I can't find a good plumber because there is no vocational education! Plumbing pays $100 an hour if you have your own truck! That's 12 times more than most PhD grad students make.<p>Huge amounts of resources are wasted at college dealing with people who should not be there.

2212295,comment,2211971,2211971,0,0,athom,,,"After reading (most of) the article, I'm not so sure about Jordan's premise. Can we really assume that webapps are really designed to streamline our lives? Perhaps that's the <i>idea</i> behind them, but let's consider the example of a (generic) news aggregator. Here's an application which, if I understand correctly, gathers news articles it deems of likely interest to the user. In theory, this saves the user hours of searching for these articles himself, but let's ask ourselves: would any user spend that kind of time, every day, looking for articles <i>without</i> the aggregator?<p>Many would, perhaps. I think most, however, would simply let it go, and save their attention for the items that rise to general attention more or less on their own. What the aggregator does, by dredging up <i>any</i> articles it deems potentially interesting, is to encourage the user to read more articles he might have otherwise missed or skipped, thereby spending <i>more</i> time reading; more even, perhaps, than he would have spent searching.<p>Now, it might be argued that such aggregators serve the user by alerting them to important articles <i>before</i> they become Big News. Although it's really beside the point, the fact is that most articles simply aren't going to rise to that level of importance. The user ultimately has to decide whether it's worth the effort to read them all; or how much time to spend deciding what to read, on top of the time spent reading. It all adds up to time spent on the aggregator's results, that might never have spent at all without them.<p>I <i>really</i> don't think Facebook is meant to simplify communication at all! It certainly hasn't been my experience. It's made it easier to find and contact other people, after a fashion, but then you've got to deal with all of those connections! Whose stuff do you actually want to see on your wall? (HINT: NOT every friend you've got, if you've got more than five!) What do you do about all those ""gifts"" and ""invitations"" to storm yet another castle? Can you just ignore them, or do you have to worry about somebody's feelings if you turn them down? Then, if you <i>do</i> take the gift, you get your turn to send your own! And, if you think for a moment, you might consider the quandary you just faced, and wonder if you really want to put other ""friends"" through the same thing? Now, maybe I'm just overthinking all of this, but to me, this doesn't sound like simplified communication. If that's what Facebook really meant to achieve, I think they've been doing it wrong.<p>This is before we even get to Jordan's point: the extra ad-riddled pages. To tell the truth, annoying as the ads can be, they really haven't seemed that much of a problem to me. Facebook doesn't even shove them in my face, just tucks them off to the right, where I can easily ignore them. In fact, what's annoyed me the most about advertisements is that they're all for about the same five different things! Seriously, if I'm going to have to look at fifty different ads, could they try to find at <i>least</i> twenty-five <i>good</i> products to promote? I probably still won't buy anything, but at least I could not-buy more stuff!<p>Anyway, that brings us to Jordan's solution: paid accounts, if I'm reading correctly. Pay to get rid of the ads, pay for fewer pages to click through, pay for less of whatever annoys you? I don't know. It seems to me I could save a lot of money, <i>and</i> a lot of time with a completely different solution: ditch the service entirely. I never needed Facebook in the first place, and only got in after receiving invitations from two different friends (as in people I actually know and like), one of whom had all but ditched the service himself by the time I finally took them up. I just might be the sociable type who benefits from a service like Facebook, but then I have to wonder: does someone who's actually sociable need an app to help them in that department? Keeping track of your contacts, sure, it can be helpful. Finding lost friends? Almost amazingly good! Actually being sociable? Eh, pick up the phone. Or email, whatever.",1297581568

There is a trend in that direction, but in my mind it's a bad thing, not a good thing.<p>In a perfect world you would take comprehensive classes specific to your chosen field, but those classes would take a more holistic approach, and would draw course material from a multitude of sources.",1297581429

It's hard for me to understand how you could have misunderstood this.<p>You make such a big deal about his comparison of the death toll to that of the Holocaust, even though it was YOU, not he, who first brought the Holocaust up via your invocation of Godwin's Law.<p>Your refusal to address the assertion that addiction has nothing to do with the molecule is well advised, since you clearly didn't take the time to understand it. You may agree or disagree with his point, but it would be better to at least look at the links he provided before commenting; the second in particular, a study from Kaiser Permanente that discusses the origins of addiction, should make clear what he was talking about.<p>It's your final paragraph, though, that motivated me to write this reply. You find Alex3917 ""offensive"" and ""disgusting""? What I find offensive and disgusting is dragging a controversial but interesting line of discussion down to the level of ad hominem attacks, strawman arguments, and deliberate misrepresentation of others' positions. That's not the kind of thing I come to this site hoping to read.",1297580786

3416878,comment,3416594,3416594,0,0,johnobrien102,,,"Couple of other things. Elsevier is $3 billion in revenue, not $10 billion (the author must be thinking of Reed Elsevier here, Elsevier's parent company.) So really they only have something like $3 billion reasons to not let the internet drive the costs of scientific publishing down to zero.<p>And to be clear, so far as I can tell, SOPA has almost nothing to do with arxiv.org, because arxiv.org publishes the manuscript, not the final version of the article. Elsevier's stated position is that publishing the manuscript version is not copyright infringement.<p>Even if SOPA passed, sure, it would be easier for Elsevier to shut down arxiv.org. But if arxiv.org started publishing the final version of articles for which Elsevier had obtained worldwide exclusive copyright, that would be copyright infringement anyway. So the key (it would seem to me) is whether arxiv.org publishes the final version of articles or not (they curenttly don't), not whether SOPA passes, that determines whether arxiv.org is to get shutdown.<p>And so if they did, the answer to the question ""Could Elsevier shut down arxiv.org?"" would be ""Yes.""<p>Right now, the answer is ""No.""",1325530419

If there are Suspended apps lying around and you launch a memory-intensive app such as a big game, iOS will start to purge Suspended apps and move them to the Not Running state. That is, they will be completely removed from memory and will launch afresh the next time you tap their icon.<p>This, however, is not ""impact-less"": when running truly memory-intensive games, they <i>will</i> experience performance degradation while the OS performs cleanup and shutdown of the various applications ""hibernating"". This is sensible on games like Infinity Blade.<p>iOS also suffers from not allowing the user to make a distinction between ""not running or hibernating"" (no resource consumption) and ""keeps your GPS or data connection active"" (very high battery drain), and not providing a way for the user to know which application requested what (in the way the ""Notification"" settings let you control notifications rights for all applications, or iOS5's new ""General > Usage"" gives you a size estimate for the system's applications).<p>I also believe this:<p>> 5. Five classes of apps - audio, GPS, VOIP, Newsstand and accessory apps - and some built-in apps such as Mail may run indefinitely in the background until they complete their task.<p>is partially incorrect in following 4.: these applications can all be killed as memory pressure on the system increases, however they have a ""higher priority"" (and thus will be killed last) compared to suspended applications.",1325528855

That's like saying ""I don't do email because of dogshit and spam"".  Spam is manageable in email, so the fact that it's out of control in comments means that noone has thought through a proper comments system.<p>When you say ""Say it somewhere that you control, and link it. That's how the web works."" I understand where you're coming from, but this is simply not true.  Wanting something to be true doesn't make it so.  The web is not made of a collection of interlinked static HTML files.  But the root of your complaint, that by commenting on someone's blog you give away your worthwhile thoughts, is also a failure of the bad comment system.<p>Comments should work a lot more like email does.  Imagine if each blog entry had an email address (or sub-address of the blog's email address) and sending a ""comment"" was really sending an email to that address.  The comment box below the blog entry is really a small email composing window which sends the comment to the blog. And it can also send it to your own email address (as a cc for the purposes of the thought experiment).  Then it would be in your email archive and not lost, but you would still be contributing to the discussion happening at the blog.  A further benefit of this is that the spam filter for the email address would function for comments on a blog.  Why reinvent the wheel?    /end example.<p>I have come to this issue from the experience of working with bloggers with quite long-running substantial blogs on Wordpress or Blogger.  They have a huge laundry list of complaints and annoyances with the software but I cannot in good faith recommend a jekyll-octopress solution or a wikified solution, or a ""static--html"" solution etc.  These ""solutions"" are poorly thought out and would represent a severe reduction in functionality for the sake of ""that's how it should be done"".

On the one hand, you are still ""sitting there"" while someone else tries to ""pour"" knowledge into you.\nOn the other hand it is pretty good to see things clearly explained on paper (story telling instinct?) and, just like the Khan videos, you can ""rewind"" a few pages back, if you don't understand something.\nI would particularly like to hear the younger crown on this one: are books still cool?<p>BTW, David Hestenes has lots of cool papers out: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=David+Hestenes+test+filetype:pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=David+Hestenes+test+filetype:...</a>",1325527806

They would communicate with each other to figure out where they are in relation to one another, and then they would, one pair at a time, fire their own thrusters to come together, and permanently join with each other, to form not only the space station itself, but also the station's distributed computing system and sensor network. The robots might even go further, by generating an atmosphere, thus allowing for the station to be occupied by humans. We already have the ability to easily send up such robots, by using Orbital's Pegasus, which is launched by a modified L-1011 from 40,000 feet. All we really need is to design, build and test the robots, such that each is no more than 1,000 pounds, as well as scale up the process of building and launching those rockets, which is covered below, in an article by John Walker, co-author of AutoCAD.<p><a href=""http://www.orbital.com/spacelaunch/pegasus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orbital.com/spacelaunch/pegasus</a><p><a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/rocketaday.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/rocketaday.html</a> (A Rocket a Day Keeps the High Costs Away)",1325527462

Not only we have a regular way for companies to add job listings to the website, we are also aggregating all the top feeds on the ""paid"" list; except for LinkedIn (which never seemed to have a ""hacker"" focus) and authentic jobs (which seemed to be more inclined to web and graphic design).

I use it all the time in python: the map and filter functions, list comprehensions, zip, ... For me, functional programming means having first-class functions that can be passed to/from other functions. A standard library of common functional combinators help, but you can always write your own.<p>Funny, but some of the most often mentioned functional languages, such as OCaml and Scala, allow liberal use of mutable variables.

3729903,comment,3728316,3728316,1,0,Seru_kr,,,"Hey, I've been in the same boat before and let me tell you about my experience.<p>I started a small business that worked in conjunction with title companies. We basically recorded on our own servers deeds, notice of defaults, and other real estate documents and sent them to the county recorders office.<p>We didn't have much competition because this concept was relatively new and not popular back then. So everything was going great except my partner and I were two completely different people when it came to managing.<p>He was a strict by-the-book kind of guy that alienated potential clients due to his stubborn nature and unwillingness to compromise. On the other hand, I was too lenient and was letting clients take advantage of us. At the time we didn't know that maybe we could complement each others weakness, so we were constantly arguing.<p>So we both went to a mediator that suggested we go on a recreational trip together and not talk about business at all. So we did and at first argued about minor stuff, but finally came to a realization that neither of us were going to succeed if we kept it up. How could we run a business together if we couldn't even come to an agreement to which car to rent? We started compromising little by little and eventually it was easy to see the other person's point of view.<p>We turned the business around, made it even more successful and sold it making both of us very happy. Now we have a new company that we started together and it is also doing pretty well.<p>My advice would be to take some time off. Maybe spend some time with your co-founder in a non-business way. Get to know him if you don't really know him well. And don't sweat the small stuff.<p>Knowing your problem is the first step, and I think you've already got that down.<p>If you still feel down, don't forget you have a growing user-base that is cheering you on.",1332259030

This requires not only that you be good, but that you get lucky: that you've accurately predicted the stack that your ops team will be pushing to standardize on in 2 years, that there's enough expertise in the language(s) you used to justify its continued use, that management hasn't decided to switch everything to Windows + .NET because ""support"", that every one of the OSS libs that you've pulled in all happen to be licensed under the three particular OSS licenses that legal decided to approve after that recent switch to a ""whitelist"" policy, that the company services you were forced to integrate with when you started haven't been shitbinned, that the new lead developer on the project doesn't have aesthetic problems with the way your code is organized, and so on. All of which usually mean ""rewrite!"", and few of which you have much control over. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter whether it's your fault or not, the people evaluating your work will still consider it ""shit"" because it's not usable anymore, and nobody loves the project enough to bother figuring out how to patch it up.<p>IMO, though, the <i>real</i> reason we all tend to produce shit (and then throw it out later) is actually missing from this otherwise excellent four-part breakdown: documentation. And I'm talking real, detailed, explicitly human-centric documentation that's more than just class/function level comments or a user manual. Lately I've been dealing with several attempted tech consolidation tasks as part of a several-tier acquisition (big fish swallows little fish, bigger fish swallows entire lake), and it seems that no matter what size the company is, nobody in software <i>ever fucking documents anything</i> well enough to reuse it, even when they're developing services that are explicitly intended to be consumed by other groups. The resulting duplication of effort is ridiculous.<p>Good internal documentation needs to start with the starter, end with the finisher, and be taken seriously by everyone in between. It should be considered almost as important to a project as the code itself. It needs to explain how to use the system, how to integrate with it, how to debug common problems, where the pain points are, how the system is architected, why certain decisions (especially tradeoffs!) were made, and more. Done right, good documentation can make up for some pretty bad code, and make sure that a project is actually maintained rather than thrown away.",1332258934

</code></pre>
I love it - but there's a problem: over the years I've formed ""muscle memory"" for the default bash (actually, readline) shortcuts:<p><pre><code>    ""ESC-."" will reproduce my last line's last argument
    ""Ctrl-a"" will take me to the line's beginning
    ""Ctrl-e"" will take me to the line's end
    ""Ctrl-w"" deletes the word before the cursor
    ""Ctrl-l"" clears the screen
</code></pre>
These obviously don't work in vi-mode - ""ESC-."" for example switches to VI command mode (because of ESC) and then ""."" repeats the last inserted word.<p>After a bit of research, I found a way to have my cake and eat it too - this is what you need in your .bashrc:<p><pre><code>    set -o vi
    bind -m vi-command ""."":insert-last-argument
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-l."":clear-screen
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-a."":beginning-of-line
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-e."":end-of-line
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-w."":backward-kill-word
</code></pre>
This way, the shortcuts I've been using for decades still work - and I can still switch to vi command mode (with ESC) and enjoy the immense powers of vi.<p>Granted, I am losing a bit of functionality (e.g. the repeating of a series of commands with a single '.') ; but if you are like me, you'll prefer this tradeoff.<p>P.S. If you need further commands to replicate, just look them up in ""man bash"" (search for ""Readline Command Names"").",1332258876

3729866,comment,3727837,3727837,1,0,robomartin,,,"Most of the comments are focusing on the installation.  That was not the point of the post.  In fact, the installation was simple enough that a a 13 year old did it without any help whatsoever.<p>It's a usability issue.  The paradigm shift is great enough that most everyone is talking about sitting in front of W8 absolutely dumbfounded.<p>I agree that it looks like a nice interface for a tablet or phone.  I don't have a Metro-interface-equipped phone or tablet but concede that the interface seems nice for type of a device.<p>So far, I simply don't see it for a classic desktop computer.  I'll put more time into it, but my first impression is that people will hate it during that critical ""open the box"" experience.<p>This is very similar to what happened in the transition from Office 2003 to, say, Office 2007.  If you were a capable user of '03 you found yourself slowing down to a crawl to figure out how to do things in '07.  Could you do exactly the same things?  Absolutely.  Yes.  And more.  Was the pain, aggravation and productivity loss worth the new look and feel?  Absolutely not.  I'll argue that there are zero incremental gains from forcing users to switch from the '03 to the '07 interface.  In fact, one could very well argue that there was a net loss due to the fact that users had to invest a sometimes not trivial amount of time to figure things out.  And all of this to do exactly the same work they were doing before the transition to Office '07.  The interface did not magically turn them into productivity masters, it actually damaged productivity.<p>So far I see the Windows 8 paradigm as a step in that direction.  Frankly, In my opinion, it has been going downhill since Vista.  XP was good.  And, yes, it could have  been improved, but there really wasn't anything fundamentally horrible about the XP experience and UI.  I don't personally care about bling-bling.  I work with my computer, it's not a toy.  Maybe that's not a typical consumer use case scenario where bling-bling might be a requirement.<p>I feel very strongly that MS should have taken the approach of incrementally improving upon XP rather than going off in these ridiculous tangents.  For example, it would have been nice to have really intelligent copying of files. You know, where if you are copying 500 files and file number 23 fails the copy routine would log it and keep going rather than killing the entire run?  And there's more.<p>But, you look at Vista and some of the decisions made and you really have to wonder what they are thinking.  Sorting of folders in Windows explorer is but one example.<p>With W8 I see a transition that is going to be jolting for most people.  Take anyone who's been using XP, Vista or 7 and plant them in front of a W8 machine (that was the point of using my 13-year-old as a test subject) and they grind to an absolute halt.<p>Keep in mind that they will be trying to do what they were doing just minutes before on the older OS.  Except that, this time around, they'll be utterly confused as to how to do it.  Sure, eventually they'll figure it out.  It might take a couple of weeks to get comfortable, maybe more for some, less for others.<p>The argument here is very simple:  The time required to learn to use the new W8 paradigm to, in  the end, accomplish nothing more and derive no productivity gains is completely wasted.  If you had a business with, say, 50 or more employees you'd be nuts to switch to W8.  The office would grind to a halt virtually overnight and it would take weeks to get back to where it was before.  In the end, not one person in this hypothetical business would be more efficient at their job due to W8.<p>BTW, just in case readers think that I might be an Apple fan-boy, know that we own about 25 Windows-based workstations, several Linux and three Macs.  Definitely not a Mac shop here.

I'm the CTO at a startup that depends way too heavily on me, and I use Tai Chi to stay sane.  Tai Chi is about a lot of things but the part that keeps me sane is the meditative aspect of running my body through a ""program"" of movements, which requires a specific amount of attention.  If your mind wanders during a Tai Chi form then you'll screw it up.  And if you focus too MUCH then you'll also screw it up.  So Tai Chi becomes a tool for practicing the mental state known as ""flow"".<p>Aside from it being a form of moving meditation for the mind, it helps the body, especially for a tech nerd. I began studying Tai Chi, I came near burnout partly because my body was always in a similar posture all week.  I developed RSI in my neck and my shoulder from constantly tensing muscles to use a mouse or trackpad.  If I worked through a weekend, or two in a row, then I might spend 20 or 30 days in a row with my shoulder tight.  Tai Chi is not intense exercise, but it moves all of your muscles through their full range of motion.  Simply having that ""program"" that I can run with my body eliminated my RSI.

The learning curve for Linux distributions was not that steep. Slackware, especially in those days, was orders of magnitude less complex than current distributions. I picked up a cheap bargain UNIX book, which was enough to get started.<p><i>Even at the point you had installed it , you would be compiling binaries with GCC that would have targetted Linux/glibc etc so you wouldn't have been able to share many of your creations</i><p>Well, sharing my creations with the world wasn't very much possible anyway, since we had no internet connection. Besides that, for me the magic was in creating a program.<p>Besides that, your comment is factually incorrect, since a DOS port of gcc was fairly quickly available (DJGPP).

But I'm worried about a ""for the rest of us"" that starts off with first Plato and then lambda calculus.<p>The problem with ""the rest of us"" is that these concepts aren't inherently neat.  Disclaimer: I'm not one of ""rest of us"".  I'm learning Haskell, just because I enjoy having to think in a new way.<p>A lot of FP explanations start off with immutability.  After plato and lambda calc, that's where this one goes, too.  I think because it's a relatively simple concept, and kind of mind blowing that you could do something useful without incrementing i in a for loop.  And then the follow up example is normally how you can replicate a for loop in functional programming.  Which is again neat.<p>But if you aren't into neat things for their own sakes, you've got to ask why?  Why replicate a for loop when you could just use one?  (answer: you don't really replicate for loops in FP)  They aren't asking why, in the sense that they're curious.  They're asking why in the sense of ""Why would anyone do that?  That's stupid.""<p>If you aren't into having your mind blown for no apparent reason (some aren't) the only really compelling thing about the first several pages of the piece is the ""Benefits of FP"".  That's the motivation to learn these crazy new concepts. It should really come first.  I think it should come first in any discussion of FP for people who aren't familiar with it.<p>Because for most people to learn, they need a motivation.  Your programs will be faster because you can do concurrency super easy is pretty good motivation.  Sadly, ""because it's neat,"" is generally not.",1332256226

The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence; until you realize you just stepped in a cow-pie.<p>You mention having a bad back; try finding a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu studio; it will definitely help your strength and is more low-impact at the beginning grappling stages (look for a smaller studio). Make sure you tell them about your back and they should help you work on it and will make sure you aren't being hurt more.<p>Give up open source; at-least scale it back for awhile. You need to be worrying more about you when you're this worn out.<p>-Don't- give up that girlfriend.",1332255821
3729584,comment,3728942,3728942,3,0,trevelyan,,,"Starting a business is not the solution, since all of the problems you describe apply equally well to a lot of founders, and especially founders without funding for whom you can add ""poor"" and ""lonely"" to the list of adjectives you use to describe your own insane lifestyle. Would you be happy working for yourself, but stuck at home all the time?<p>So fix the problem... scale yourself back to eight hours a day. Make it a point to leave the office by 6:30. After a month of this shift this up to normal closing time. There is no need to ask permission: if someone asks say you have something in the evenings after work. If this is a problem waltz into a more reasonable position.<p>That said, one practical suggestion is that if you're changing your work hours, you need to get into the office at or before 9:00am, since it is common for managers to perceive staff as coming in late, but very rare for them to recognize the sheer amount of time put in working late. You also don't want to spend a lot of time at the office talking about your new evening activities while you're getting people conditioned to your working non-insane hours. You want the only noticeable shift in your behavior to be the fact you leave at a reasonable hour. After a month or two you won't need to worry about this, but if you give into the temptation it might be perceived as flaunting authority.",1332255812

3729580,comment,3722324,3729316,1,0,kls,,,"I think you miss my overarching point, as someone who has read all of the books, I can assure you there is very little in them that states go kill in my name, the old testament being the exception but for the major two religions they where superseded by new covenants via either the Koran or the gospel. Christ talked about universal forgiveness and pacifism and Mohammad had very specific rules of engagement for self defense. If we bring in Buddhism to round it out then we find more pacifism.<p>I cover that background to reach the following point and that is it's not what is in the book, as many of the leaders pervert what the book says and many followers never read it for themselves, the pages could be blank and it would be the same result. it is the people involved that is the problem and given those peoples desire if they could not control others via religion then they would do it via politics or race or another means of dividing people and that is the core issue getting rid of religion will not have a net impact because the system and volume of those being controlled will just shift to other mechanisms. Dealing with the root cause is what we need to focus on and not the symptoms, religion is but a symptom as such fixing it will provide no cure.",1332255770

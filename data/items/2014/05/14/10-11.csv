Second, you have to believe that the process as it&#x27;s currently carried out in academia and elsewhere leads to valid, relatively unbiased results.<p>The first is more of a metaphysical question. But there are huge doubts about the second in every discipline, maybe except physics. There are publishing biases, observational studies everywhere, replication problems, sample biases (19 year old college students), even straight up fraud that goes uncorrected for years.

7743045,comment,7738194,7742293,1,0,mercer,,,"Yes. Instead of passing the instance variables from the controller to the view, you instead send it to the client as JSON and basically replace the state of the relevant component(s) (through the ajax callback, or whatever method you prefer).<p>As your app grows, it might become inefficient to send down the now-huge JSON object, and you might want to add some client-side logic to deal with that. However, this might not even be necessary, as 1) even though you replace the entire state, React will only update what changed, and 2) by using optimistic updating on the client (or whatever the proper term is), the user might not notice that the actual data-syncing is a bit slower. Plus, it&#x27;ll still be faster than a server-side-only approach.<p>The nice thing is that sending the total state (of the page or component) every time significantly simplifies matters, to the point where you might be able to keep relying on your server-side framework for most of the logic, at least until you need to start optimizing stuff.",1400064532

I&#x27;m never without a &#x27;real&#x27; camera without at least an APS-C sized sensor, so the camera on my cellphones might as well not exist.  If I could get even a couple dollar discount on a phone with no camera I&#x27;d take it.<p>Having said all of that, I realize that it makes no business sense for any phone maker to cater to me considering the costs of having a separate camera-less SKU would far outweigh any additional sales they might get by catering to the extreme minority of people like me, and having a phone with no camera option at all is just too niche to bother with.",1400062210

There is a difference between being better at execution and walking away with the code that was being used to implement one idea, and implementing it yourself.",1185821717

Essentially we'd implemented SmarterChild before it became popular.  Then when AJAX was all the rage in late 2004 and 2005, I said ""Oh, wouldn't it be cool if you could put live chat up on a web page and update the display through AJAX?""  <p>I was actually thinking in terms of the social-networking angle - you ever notice how many conversations on LiveJournal comments or FaceBook walls start out as asynchronous messages and then become conversations when both/all parties get online?  There's room to make that interaction a lot more frictionless, and I have actually seen anyone go through with it.  Maybe I'll be saying ""Damn, I regret not implementing <i>that</i> idea"" in another 2 years.<p>Anyway, it's not who thinks up the idea that matters, it's who actually goes and <i>does</i> it.  Most successful ideas are pretty obvious, they're just overlooked because people think ""If it were that easy, somebody would've done it already"".",1185820453

37721,comment,37593,37700,0,0,samson,,,"I also agree. I think passive applications will start to take more of a role in making things easier for users without them having to constantly tell the technology what to do.<p>Web 2.0 seems to me like we have taken one step backwards with regard technological innovation. There's nothing inherently advanced about tagging (which seems to be one of the corner stone features of web 2.0), to me it's a thing that could have been done in the 1980's (if not 70's). All thats been done recently is we figured that computers on their own cannot do all that we expect it to. <p>Unfortunately I think in figuring this out we have gone a little too much on the extreme end of things. Users are now at the point where they constantly have to tag EVERY SINGLE THING to find it.<p>But this is not a complete bashing of the way the web is now, perhaps we needed to take that one step backward, before we can now move several steps forward.",1185819709
37720,story,,,17,27,palish,"Deploying on EC2 + S3",,"Hello all,<p>I have a little side project I'm getting ready to launch.  It's a Rails app using MySQL (though database choice doesn't matter, since it's Rails).  I'm considering launching the app purely on S3 + EC2.  The idea is, the code will live in S3 by using the S3 filesystem component.  I can develop locally and deploy via Capistrano when I push out a new release.  The code is then deployed to S3 and the EC2 instance restarts.<p>I'm wondering if this is even viable.  Has anyone else that you know of done it? <p>For the database, I have two options.  I could either leave the database on the EC2 instance and back it up nightly and never restart the instance (since data only disappears if you restart the instance or due to a hardware failure).  The advantage there is database queries are most likely much faster, since it doesn't have to hit the network for each new database query.  The disadvantage is, the data may disappear at the drop of a hat, and then it's backup-restore time.  The other option is keeping the database in S3, which seems totally secure but might be slow for queries.  I'll, of course, be using memcached and other caching mechanisms, but database load seems like it could still play a part.<p>What d'you think, would you launch on EC2 + S3?<p>",1185819696

37718,comment,37489,37630,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Bittorrent grew out of MojoNation, a ""distributed, peer to peer, file store"", per wikipedia.  So it already had a business sponsoring it.<p>Distributing content tracking is much harder than distributing the content, and if they'd waiting to solve that problem before publishing code, it probably would have died.  I think there's a lesson here: don't wait to solve all your problems before you launch, because even if some of them are insoluble, the parts you have solved might be useful enough to be successful.  I suppose other people have more concisely summed that up as ""release early; release often"", eh?",1185819582

If I recall correctly, the videos application was developed in-house before the platform was ever released to third-party developers. Because videos and other applications started building their own walls, facebook opened the wall for platform users. This is a good thing for developers, not a bad thing.<p>The statement that ""Facebook engineers will detect it, copy the functionality, and render your app pointless"" is a pretty wild claim to make without backing it up with evidence.",1185819265

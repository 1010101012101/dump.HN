VNC, X11 etc. It's not particularly fashionable, but PC hardware is so cheap you might as well buy a new one. You can easily spawn an instance on EC2 and connect to it, but those machines don't have state-of-the art GPUs.<p>The problem they're trying to solve here is that a new gaming PC can cost a couple of thousand dollars, and you have to keep it on the bleeding edge of expensive hardware to play the latest games. It's typical that even the most avid gamers simply can't keep up with all the consoles and PC hardware.",1238496841

I understand the benefit of fitting the URL into a tweet, but full length URLs have a lot of advantages: you can make a judgement on the likely interest or usefulness of the link before you click on it. And there are some links that I normally wouldn't touch with someone else's ten foot cattle prod, which I might click on because I can't do reverse-hashing in my head. (Obviously some of the more mathematically talented HN readers probably can :-)<p>If Twitter introduces a new way of inserting links then these businesses could disappear overnight.",1238496619

I know lots of people who hate Microsoft products but still use them esp. non-techy users. They just don't see that there is a viable alternative.<p>They see Apple products as too expensive (especially if they not in the market for a new machine anyway) and Linux is not a valid choice to them, if they have even heard of it.<p>The Xbox 360 has widely reported (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems</a>), ongoing, hardware faults and is beaten in sales by the Wii.

539898,comment,538555,539313,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Another factor that comes into play is having regular periods of intense focus. We all claim to be focusing when we're doing work, but there are still all those microdistractions that come with the territory. You'll learn very quickly how to maintain focus if you down want to drop a couple hundred pounds on your chest.<p>There was a period of time when I wasn't working out, but I'd go for a drive late at night when I was stressed. Not a normal drive, mind you; I would blast up and down the side of a nearby mountain. The physical aspect of driving, combined with the focus necessary to not go flying off a cliff, had a very similar effect. I don't recommend this, as it was extremely reckless, but if you happen to live anywhere near a track, or even a karting facility, I'd strongly suggest trying it out.",1238496217

1.

539884,comment,539276,539691,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"Well i think you're quite wrong to put all languages on the same level here. I mean, as programmers we know very well than some languages are closer by spirit than others, even if their syntax differ greatly.<p>It's exactly the same thing for spoken languages. I'm french, and i learnt English, German, and a bit of Spanish. Once you learnt one, you can learn the others more easily, not only because of your mind adapting to other languages, but also because those languages share a lot, be it from a vocabulary perpective or from a grammatical one.<p>I'm no expert in asian languages, but from my past in linguistic and ethnology, i aquired the strong belief that theses languages are different enough to really ""wire"" your brain differently.<p>And you must also take into account the cultural penetration of the english/american culture into a country. Even if this penetration happenned everywhere, Western Europe has much more exposure to this culture than , say , China.<p>The bottom line is : French people will probably never need a french StackOverflow as badly as Chinese people.<p>The world is not flat !",1238495349

539880,comment,539637,539703,0,0,kulkarnic,,,"I think that their motivations are different too. Wanting to build companies that might one day compete with Google is unthinkable; so one must assume these are ventures that either do something totally different from Google's current businesses; or are somehow attractive as ""experiments"" Google doesn't have the focus to perform itself (the last obvious category is ""companies Google wishes to acquire""; but smart founders who happen to have such an idea would not use Google Ventures simply because of the conflict of interest).<p>Btw, is this typical of corporate venture funds or is Google trying something new?",1238495051

539875,comment,539772,539772,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"This is broken in so many ways. Of course the music listened to by the largest number of people is going to correlate to a more average SAT score. The children that regularly listen to classical are those with parents who either intentionally expose them to it at home (which means that they are likely well-educated) or have them take music lessons (which indicates both a concern for their child's mental development as well as above-average financial status). So music and SAT scores are largely influenced by the same factors: education and money.<p>Also, as someone who spent over a decade of my childhood playing classical piano, I'd suggest that the vast majority of college-age kids who have Beethoven on their ""favorite music"" list are smart kids just trying to appear to be even smarter. Notice how no other composers, modern or classical, are listed; Beethoven is to classical music what the Beatles are to classic rock and Jay-Z is to hip hop: a generic name for someone to pull, the Java of composers. If I was listing what instrumental music I <i>do</i> listen to, I'd be putting up names that define the styles I like. Philip Glass? Branford Marsalis? Ludovico Einaudi? Sure. Beethoven? Negative.<p>The only thing I can possibly attest to is the lyrical / instrumental dichotomy. Sometimes it takes a certain kind of mind to appreciate some instrumental music; you have to be able to sit and analyze it, recognize the patterns / progressions, etc. That's why I could see popular bands like Radiohead, U2, and even RATM to a certain extent, doing better than other groups in their genre.",1238494379

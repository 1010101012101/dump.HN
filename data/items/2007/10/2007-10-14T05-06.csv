67575,comment,67527,67547,0,0,iamwil,,,"Yeah, but my first thought was, how are you going to get all that energy out of orbit through the atmosphere to the ground without losing most of it?<p>Granted, I skimmed the article for this little tidbit, and all I saw was that NASA said it was technically feasible, but not very economical.  <p>I remember that E&M transmission through air lost power exponentially.  Maybe when they say 'beam', they mean an actual light beam.  The space elevator is powered by a laser aimed from the ground, so I suppose that's not entirely infeasible.

It turns out that locality isn't actually a principle of physics and now we have entanglement, Einstein's ""spooky action at a distance.""",1192339039

That doesn't sound like it'd work for Monday night and tomorrow would definitely be too short of notice.<p>Next weekend might be a better date for something along those lines. SF is a nice place; how about postponing your flight? ;)",1192339007

A phenomena you see in the military, and I would expect any other place with large responsibilities, are leaders unwilling to make the tough calls.  Why?  Because a bad decision can cost them their career, their family's livelihood, and may even mean a court martial.<p>So, in the corporate world, a large severance package can encourage the CEOs to make those tough calls.  Of course, the other side is that taking away repercussions can lessen the gravity of a decision, and a leader may not exercise due diligence.  Hence, large severance packages are more a balancing act than something we should direct our moral outrage against.  In my opinion, it is often better to make a tough decision, even if it is wrong, than to wait in paralysis.",1192338964

Hopefully, the 'thought experiments' will lead to something testable.",1192338792

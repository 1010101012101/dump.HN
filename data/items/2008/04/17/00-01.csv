165827,comment,165590,165590,0,0,thorax,,,"Corporations do lots of random things to motivate their sales guys. Lots of weird things, lots of cheesy things.<p>This is surely just a silly, known-to-be-ridiculous video they put together as one of their sillier/lighter things for sales training, or a sales conference keynote.<p>How about some of you guys share some of your insight on how you plan to (or do) motivate your sales and marketing guys? Or are salespeople a thing your companies will never have?<p>I personally haven't given it much thought, but seeing some of the 'net reaction' to this video, I see a number of people misunderstanding this. Perhaps because they've never worked in management at a large corp (and maybe never want to)?<p>When I see this, it just reminds me of the sorts of problems corporations have when they get larger. It's not a minor problem when you consider the idea of having thousands of software salespeople who don't necessarily have the tech knowledge (or time) to study up on new features/tricks to get their clients to upgrade/buy. Tricks like this at least force them to take a deep breath and think about how they might position things better when new offerings are available.<p>There's almost no doubt that a clever entrepreneur could make a lucrative business if they're able to improve upon the existing sales training/motivation models. There's a lot of money on the line in these corporations to improve these things (as one would expect).",1208392929

If I'm in SJ and going to Long Beach for a weekend, it's no more time to just drive (and a 10% chance of a speeding ticket seems high even if you don't count the fact that you can just not speed and reduce it to 0%) and saves me the hassle/expense of renting a car.",1208392916

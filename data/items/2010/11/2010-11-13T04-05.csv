1900326,story,,,3,2,synto0day,"Ask HN: Meeting with an investor in few hours, what is your advice HNers?",,"Hello,<p>Please excuse me for creating this temporary account to place the question, I just wouldn't want to be linked to this question.<p>So, now my question I need advice. In few hours I am meeting with a guy from a hedge fund, he is interested to investing as angel or with the hedge fund, as I had a meeting with him already and he wants in. My question is a bit complex one, as it involves two issues.<p>The first it's an issue with my supposed to be future co-founder. I expected that he'd manage finding the investor or at least setting up meeting with prospectives. Instead I've done that (the 2nd meeting tomorrow with an investor who is really interested) and please note I'm also the technical founder. Also, I had the initial idea and identified the opportunity, although this guy seems to have a talent at presenting others people ideas as his own. Please note he is not technical at all, but I accepted that, assumingly he would do all the business stuff, instead he dissapointed me, as he really didn't do much the last 1.5 months as I was insisting we go full time on this as soon as possible. At this point, I am serious about finding a way to avoid getting involved with guy. The only thing I am attached with him is that he knows big part of the core ideas (I know the execution pitch so please save me from one. I do have a significant code base I am contributing, and with the meaning of core ideas I mean validated ideas).<p>So, with this small bits of information, what would you do HNers concerning with a prospective co-founder he doesn't seem honest and failed your expectations? I even have some e-mails with significant questions he left unanaswered. So, imagine that.<p>So, concering the valuation now. Like I said, I considered my prospective co-founder's significant contribution, in the initial phase, to finding prospective investors as he made believe he would be able to do that in short time. Instead, he delayed me and I am sure he'd delayed me more hadn't I do anything to find an investor myself. So, he gives me the feeling that he is not honest. Therefore, even in a valuation at this level if the investor would take up to 20-30% at a valuation of 500k, and assuming any kind of contribution (of the non-technical co-founder) begin after the software is rolled out (estimated after 5-6 months), how is it reasonable to excuse his percentage, which I was willing to be equal, but I am sure the investor will find awkward.<p>So, at this point I am considering changing the location of the meeting with the investor and go to it alone, telling him it was cancelled.<p>What are your thoughts HNers?",1289623991

Work is decent right now but majority of my work is really on overseeing some of the other developers and helping with projects that are behind schedule ramp up to speed. The challenge is more on managing personalities rather than my own development skills. I would be promoted to a more senior role very shortly. I would rate the work as about 6/10, love having fun with most of my co workers, but I would love to work with some ""A Type"" players instead.<p>Other Employment Opportunity:<p>I also have opportunity to join a company that is more innovative and business oriented. The work will be more focused on emerging trends (which I love), a bit more prototyping and understanding opportunities and work with what I believe to be more ""A Type"" players. I suspect the demand physically and mentally would be much greater.<p>I have excellent trust and respect for each of my manager in both scenarios.<p>I also have a strong desire to pave my own success and work on a start up which I have done so thus far by working late at nights. Until my start-up is at a state where I can launch and be profitable, I would still like to be employed and potentially grow. Beta could be in a couple of months.<p>Which option should I take and why? This will certainly help me out in making a decision.",1289623938

Certainly I don't think any of them have the kind of monopoly that AT&T had, but Facebook might be close as they continue sinking their Facebook Connect hooks in.<p>The trouble is that monopolies are not good or bad per se.  Google and Facebook are still mostly innovating and adding value.  At some point the landscape starts to change, and that's when they get scared and start getting anti-competitive and the balances start to tip.<p>The tricky thing is determining when this is.  Certainly the government is ill-equipped to figure it out, because it's all sound bites and popular opinion by an apathetic voter base.  So the rationale for why a monopoly should be broken up gets sanded down to a slogan about monopolies being bad, and pretty soon politicians are jumping on the monopoly-busting bandwagon without any kind of legitimate rationale.<p>This is why, I really value the old-school intellectual movement that Chomsky represents of standing outside and speaking truth to power.  Even if a lot of his analysis is flawed and ideas ultimately wrong, the honesty with which he pursues them is admirable and we need many more like him to keep America honest.  The rich won't do it (as a group they are too fearful), the powerful won't do it, and government is certainly too awash in lobbyists and bureaucracy to have any hope.",1289623068

They were just <i>too alien.</i>  That isn't to say there can't be great fiction where the conflict between alien races is over that difference, like 3 worlds, (Ender's Game comes to mind), but the point is always <i>to reaffirm what it means to be human</i>.  You just can't do that if the humans in your book are alien.",1289622317

My point is that this is completely impossible if you cannot realize the appreciation in value. As an employer, you can only realize the engineer's productivity until he or she changes jobs.<p>If we were talking tulips, if you purchase at 100 florins, and a year later the bulbs are worth 400 florins in the market, you've made 300 florins profit.<p>With an employee, if you hire them at a salary of $100k, and a year later, they are worth $400k in the market, you do not receive any of that difference.<p>edit: A bubble in assets that can be resold can happen because it rational on the small scale to buy into the bubble. Everyone may know it will pop eventually, but people think they can make money and then get out. A bubble in unsellable things like employees can't happen because no one can expect that he will be able to ""resell"" an employee at a higher price.",1289622270
1900271,comment,1898004,1899506,0,0,hammerdr,,,"> possible consequences of changing protocols and semantics on the fly is hugely complex<p>Except when you assume that you're reading the semantics from each and every response. It introduces some complexity to how clients need to accept responses. However, once that part is done the changing protocol and semantics should not disrupt the system.<p>And testing? That's not a very difficult component to test. Throw a few different 'schemas' at the HTTP client response module and then feel safe to drop that into your application. I believe you're imagining a system that is more highly coupled to the response schema. This approach is meant to remove that coupling entirely (well, except for a base uri :))<p>I agree that embedding <link />'s into the response is a violation of a separation of concerns. They should probably be separated in some way (HTTP headers?). However, there are precious few examples of this in the wild and we may see some creative ways to separate these (I just hope we don't go the way of XML to have a different resource to specify schema).",1289622188

Because I do so many other things with various text fields on my machine, and vim bindings everywhere is not really feasible (yet?!), being very adept with the Command/Option/Shift/Arrow Keys/Cut/Paste is something that has widespread utility.<p>The vim bindings for this stuff are much richer, and fewer key strokes of course, but the universality matters, and the buffer/clipboard dichotomy is pretty well handled in MacVim, but it's still the type of thing that is quite difficult to really dial-in without building for a specific OS from the ground up.<p>And of course there are a few nice things that developing for a specific GUI affords you where vim even with plugins isn't quite as elegant.<p>However that said, all editors involve tradeoffs, and Vim's ubiquity and raw editing power make it kind of a sure bet until the day we are dictating whole programs to orders-of-magnitude-smarter-than-human AIs.  Emacs also gets the nod of course, since there is no chance of either of those going away, and no chance that anyone invents an editor that blows both of those away for all general purpose editing.<p>But I do have to give Allan Odgaard special thanks for forcibly showing me the light: that no matter how brilliant proprietary software may be, if it's my primary tool that I intend to use for the next 50+ years, closed source or a project with a risk of losing critical mass is simply a poor bet over time.<p>And of course I will still buy TM 2 when it comes out if he reverses his decision not to charge for it (which he should, and maybe give it away to individuals that complain, because who shouldn't be paid for years of secret toil?), and I'll likely still use it for its diff syntax highlighting, complex regex ack (because how long does it take to figure out the number of backslashes to escape something through ex, bash, and ack?).

It's not that expensive living in India, and a dot-com startup doesn't require any funds really.<p>3) The real strengths of YC, as others have observed, are mentors and a hacker culture.  How would you offer that ?<p>4) Is an IIM the right place to incubate ?<p>5) A YC like incubator does best in a place which already has a thriving hacker / entrepreneurial culture. Gujarat, BTW, is perhaps the most entrepreneurial state in India.<p>6) You say that ""IIM Ahmedabad students shall work closely with the teams to develop a sound business plan"".  Is that not a little insulting to suggest that hackers can only hack :) ?  After all they are the only ones who understand their product, and can possibly form a business plan.",1207741286

Well that depends on who you ask, of course.<p>IMO, the value proposition of Bitcoin&#x27;s underlying protocol is enormous. You can strip away the coin and manipulate the protocol for alternative use cases, such as carbon dating (voting, prior art, etc...) [1], carbon emissions trading platforms [2], the preservation of open data [3], reputation scoring for TTPs [4], messaging systems [5], decentralized asset exchanges [6], etc...<p>As for more traditional use cases Bitcoin obviously shines in bankless states with weak national currencies. In the same vein Bitcoin offers protection from seizure of funds during bail-ins and the like. In the context of donations Bitcoin is awesome as well; without Bitcoins wikileaks would have some trouble accepting donations. The list is endless, really. Every use case is powerful.<p>[1] CommitCoin: <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/677.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/677.pdf</a><p>[2] CarboCoin: <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6468350"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=64683...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://btcgsa.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Decentralized-Hosting-and-Preservation-of-Open-Data.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://btcgsa.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Decentralized-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6550483"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnum...</a><p>[5] BitMessage<p>[6] BitShares, MasterCoin, Freimarkets",1378187877

Given Microsoft&#x27;s perspective, they know they need to increase Windows Phone share. The iPhone is on its way to become a niche device, so I doubt they would look to Apple and try to turn Microsoft+Nokia into the one-stop-shop for Windows Phone devices like I&#x27;ve seen speculated in many places. That&#x27;s too big of a gamble. Instead, I think they&#x27;d model after Android, which now has 80% of the market, and continue strong on the OEM route, with Nokia-based devices just acting as a leader. The way I see it, this aligns much better with what&#x27;s worked historically for Microsoft and what shareholders expect, especially given the Surface blunder. At least I hope so.<p>The problem is that Samsung, HTC and LG are all focused on Android, and Microsoft needs to change that. Can the Nokia buy help with that? I wonder. What would stop Microsoft from using Nokia&#x27;s patents aggressively (rather than defensively) to &quot;motivate&quot; the other phone manufacturers to produce, market and license more Windows Phone devices, or face additional lawsuits against their majority-Android lines? Nokia alone didn&#x27;t have the incentive to push to increase WP share outside their lines before, and Microsoft appears to already have a strong patent portfolio for mobile (source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone_wars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone_wars</a>).

Now that they are trading at less than $4, it&#x27;s pretty clear that something isn&#x27;t working, so they need to just skip all the presences and just join Microsoft. I&#x27;m not sure how Microsoft&#x27;s own transition is going to play in this, but I bet that hurried up the deal a bit.<p>So, the benefit for the shareholders is that they won&#x27;t loose any more money than they already have. Microsoft has provided a decent backstop to stop the loss in value.<p>Plus, I haven&#x27;t seen what Microsoft is actually buying... they may end up leaving the backend infrastructure products as a separate company, which would probably leave shareholders with some value.",1378184669

6319068,comment,6303410,6316987,1,0,bartonfink,,,"Zapier is absolutely not a replacement for Rails. It is, however, all Matchist seems to pitch. I&#x27;m sure that they get a lot of clients asking for that sort of work, and that their projects are representative of that particular market. My point is, that&#x27;s a market I have little interest in entering right now. Think of the difference between e.g. Pivotal Labs and the local &quot;computer store&quot; that advertises web development below networking and VOIP. I want someone to help push me towards the Pivotal Labs end of the spectrum. I don&#x27;t need the opportunity to compete with other developers for low-value, low-skill work. I would like to pay for the opportunity to work on challenging, career-furthering projects that aren&#x27;t the coding equivalent of &quot;wham, bam, thank you RAM.&quot; That opportunity could take the shape of an agent.<p>I have two counterpoints in favor of the agent idea. Let&#x27;s say I sign up with Al the Agent. Al&#x27;s responsibilities can be roughly described as business development for an individual - i.e. me. I&#x27;d like it if Al could talk to me periodically, find out what I do and what I&#x27;d like to do, and keep putting opportunities for appropriate contract work in front of me. That&#x27;s MVP. There&#x27;s lots of room for improvement and other services, but MVP is literally someone else pounding the pavement. Now, to my counterpoints.<p>First, I don&#x27;t care if Al has multiple developers. I only care that he can keep my pipeline full when I need it. Sports, film, television, music - all these other fields use agents, and those agents represent multiple clients in controlled ways. I don&#x27;t care if Al represents 10 other developers, and in a way, I hope he does - it raises his profile (and, implicitly, mine). As long as he&#x27;s still able to adequately meet my needs, I&#x27;m happy. If he starts pitching low-value WordPress theming (something I have no interest in), I&#x27;ll sever the agreement. Even if this agency did turn into a Matchist-type service (which it needn&#x27;t), that would not be a bad thing. As long as it doesn&#x27;t turn into another boss, I&#x27;m happy.<p>Second, constant communication isn&#x27;t really necessary. I can just talk to Al on a weekly basis, tell him what&#x27;s going on, what I&#x27;d like to do, when I&#x27;ll need more work, when I&#x27;m going to be on vacation, etc. That&#x27;s not a taxing amount of communication, especially since I&#x27;m willing to make the economics work with a large percentage cut. I have a very limited amount of time I can put towards moonlighting (roughly 20 hours a week). If someone can help me do more profitable things (e.g. coding for money) with those hours, I&#x27;m happy to share the spoils. The common wisdom on HN is that a good developer can command somewhere around $100/hr for freelance work, which doesn&#x27;t seem exaggerated since SV salaries can easily push $70/hr before benefits. If Al can get me 20 hours of work a week at $100/hr, I&#x27;m happy to cut him a big slice of that pie if he&#x27;s willing to do that sort of communication.",1378184443

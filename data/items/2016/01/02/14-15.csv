He&#x27;s slightly above 50, with qualifications (B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering) and a lot of experience. However, he has been jobless since his last company closed, 6 years ago.<p>It&#x27;s really a perfect shitstorm for people in his situation. He has a lot of experience, but in the manufacturing industry which, as we know, is being dislocated elsewhere (we live in Portugal). There&#x27;s the competition of younger graduates, which are also unemployed. Of course, he&#x27;s too young to retire. And he&#x27;s been unemployed long enough, so state benefits expired; the last resort state benefit - for poverty, really - doesn&#x27;t apply because my parents have a house (so, he&#x27;d have to sell the house to get the state benefit).<p>Luckily he has some money set aside, but - again - this is Portugal. You can save some money with our wages, but not nearly enough to support such a tremendous amount of time unemployed. And, well, luckily I&#x27;m employed but the same reasoning applies: I&#x27;m able (and happy) to help, but I don&#x27;t make nearly enough to be able to do so and still save for a rainy day.",1451746335

For example, it&#x27;s role could also be analogous to a radio.<p>What happens when the science will eventually come up with technology to recreate (by all external empirical evidence) a human consciousness? Would you still say it&#x27;s a &quot;question outside science&quot;? Then perhaps you can still claim that even the newely created mind inside a machine is also just a &quot;radio&quot; receiving the consciousness signals from the cosmos? Even so, of course noone can stop you from looking at things from that perspective, but then you can perhaps just look at the practical applications of understand exactly how such &quot;radios&quot; work and being able to have a technology which will in all external observable regards act as a human (even if you still perhaps won&#x27;t believe it will have the same &quot;real&quot; type of consciousness as one).<p>The peculiar thing about this question is that normally people who don&#x27;t understand some advanced science (like automobiles or computing or radio, etc.) - don&#x27;t actively express a will to keep others from studying and developing that science. There are billions who don&#x27;t understand all the intricacies of a modern smartphone, but almost none of them (minus the religious fanatics) say things like &quot;humans should not try to find this out&quot;, &quot;that is not a question for science&quot;, &quot;you will never be able to understand that&quot;, &quot;herecy!&quot;, etc.<p>And yet, when it comes to the science of consciousness, the mind, human cognition, artificial intelligence etc - we hear these voices all the time. &quot;Stop studying the brain&quot;, &quot;science can&#x27;t help&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;ll never understand the mind&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s above our abilities&quot;, etc. etc.<p>Latest years have shown a tremendous progress in understanding and recreating parts of human intelligence. The task is huge and a lot is left to do, but every new understanding or technology clearly shows a pattern that we are getting close to it. And yet no matter how much &quot;evidence&quot; (in form of recreating) comes up, people still seem to feel unsettled that the science tries (and slowly succeeds) to understand the human mind.<p>Having talked to many of these people it almost seems like they have a fear, a deep rooted fear of being a &quot;machine&quot; themselves. Somehow if they know that there is someone who understands how they work (and can recreate them), they feel like that diminishes their value, or perhaps removes their &quot;soul&quot; somehow? \nWell it doesn&#x27;t. No amount of technical understanding and technological will abilities will diminish any subjective religious and other deep experiences. Because that&#x27;s what they are: subjective.<p>> But seeing the radio as the source would be kinda missing the whole point, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>What point are these scientists missing?\nThey are simply trying to create Strong AI. \nThere is no &quot;point&quot; to this besides the technology itself.<p>Sorry if anyone is upset, I&#x27;m just trying to understand the objection here.

8381126,comment,8378743,8380685,1,0,gwern,,,"> #1 is particularly troubling since you seem to argue it by misrepresenting his argument instead of addressing it directly. The alternative is to perform the experiment w/informed consent, not to keep the results of your unethical experiment secret.<p>No, the alternative is to go through a long rigmarole which may or may not approve the experiment and enforce conditions which may or may not themselves constitute severe biases of their own (knowing one is in an experiment, even if the subjects have been deceived as to the content, is itself a problem).<p>> #2 - you seem to make no effort to address this either. To me, it is particularly troubling if the business and academic sides of FB freely interacted here because each side has an incomplete understanding of the other side&#x27;s motives and priorities and constraints.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to be addressed here. Businesses have always allied with scientists when they find common interests, from astronomers preparing tables for shipping to Gosset inventing a good chunk of modern statistics for optimizing a beer brewery. All he&#x27;s done is talk vaguely about &#x27;boundaries&#x27; and insinuate dark things.<p>> Seeing you utterly dismiss the first two points with &#x27;Oh good, so the author isn&#x27;t a complete idiot.&#x27; is not exactly a revelatory argumentative triumph. You can do better.<p>Those points are fundamentally irrelevant to the overarching claim he makes that it&#x27;s <i>bad science</i>. I think he&#x27;s wrong about the more... philosophical aspects of things, but I don&#x27;t have to show he&#x27;s wrong - he has to show they materially affect the truth of the results. He has to show that #1 and #2 actually matter, and he hasn&#x27;t. Instead, he spent an incredible amount of verbiage on vaguely related topics and he flubbed the technical criticisms. I don&#x27;t give him a pass on that and neither should you.",1411945045

The default baud rate of 57600 is too high (at least for the 6-ft mini-DIN cables we could find), and it&#x27;s really annoying when your Roomba goes careening off in a weird direction because your command got corrupted. Thankfully the baud rate can be reduced, but there really ought to be something in the next layer to check integrity, as the Roomba firmware is a black box.<p>Also, it&#x27;s kinda obvious in retrospect, but Roombas were not designed to drive in straight lines.

It was quick to prototype, but as we scaled up we started hitting the limitations of the platform very quickly.<p>The main issue is that every single mobile device has a slightly different rendering engine. Even two different Android phones from the same manufacturer will behave slightly differently.

Particularly because most cities have been severely damaged and then rebuilt according to a plan (e.g. London after the 1600s fire, but also after the second world war, both to rebuild bombed areas, but also as part of an expansion of the city where large parts were built completely after the late 1940s UK town and country planning acts, which is not dissimilar to the late 1910s act after the first world war.)",1411942460

You can do anything and everything in 10 different ways that are all equally complex. Chef for example has 9+ levels of attribute overrides ranging from X different cookbook attributes to Y different role attributes. I ask why are there so many override levels and there is no good answer because I&#x27;ve never needed more than 3 levels of attribute overrides. There&#x27;s more but the override levels on their own are already enough headache. Then there are the ones that use a custom configuration language. I enjoy writing and using DSLs as much as the next guy but the whole point of DSLs is to keep them away from the Turing completeness threshold. As soon as you cross it there is no point in having one. All of the tools commit this sin except for Chef which just embeds the DSL in Ruby.<p>There is also the fact that none of these tools actually address cloud provisioning. They all work really well once you have your entire topology mapped out but do nothing to actually help with building that topology. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m hoping Terra takes over because it addresses this aspect of configuration management and I rather use something from Hashicorp than some other vendor.",1411942399

I think we&#x27;re using the wrong word here.<p>If you look at a city like Paris for example, Haussmann&#x27;s plan, in my opinion at least, has created an absolutely stunning and unique city.

Lots of open spaces, green spaces, make cities walkable, good public transportation, mix housing with light commercial areas,  keep heavy industry outside of the city, mix housing catering to various socioeconomic classes, create a good amount of density so you don&#x27;t get sprawl, but so you don&#x27;t get overcrowding either, and focus (public) transport on connecting residential and office/commercial areas.

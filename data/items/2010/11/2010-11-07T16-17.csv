Microsoft seems to be betting its Windows Phone 7 strategy on converting feature phone users to WP7 smart phones.  It is going to be a long time before smart phones are zero-sum.<p>What would be interesting is how tough it is going to be for different app types to switch between devices and what the store situation is going to look like in the next couple of years.  Those are more interesting questions when considering what a developer is going to do.<p>For example,  OpenGL ES is standard on iOS and Android, but I believe it is not on WP7.  This might be a big hurdle for smaller companies and not allow the development of WP7 versions of some games.<p>""Apple will always be the Maserati of smartphones — leading-edge, trendy, stylish, downright awesome.""<p>I have a tough time believing any article that takes the Apple Mac strategy and assumes it is the same for iPhones or iPads.

I would be interested in what would happen if the lowest paying teachers were forced to addend additional training. Perhaps all they need is a refresher. It is also possible that they have become disillusioned with what they once thought was a great way to make an effect on children's lives. I could very well imagine this happening to me were I to become a teacher.<p>The other is how they are measuring teacher performance. The only way I have seen this happen is though standardized tests. I do not believe that these actually measure much. The best teachers I have had have not taught me based on what was on the test, which would have meant spoon-feeding me facts and telling me to memorize them, but rather what they felt was important, which often included explaining how I could find the information on my own if I even needed.",1289148980

1879705,comment,1879292,1879292,0,0,jeromec,,,"I don't think the financial crisis would have occurred, at least not to the degree it has, without the problematic credit ratings of the toxic securities -- from major ratings agencies like Moody's, Fitch, and S&P.<p>This from the article catches my eye:<p><i>The seeds of today's problem were planted long ago, and its forgotten history holds important lessons. In 1936, as part of reforms under the new Banking Act, the U.S. government mandated that federally regulated banks could no longer hold securities that weren't rated investment-grade by at least two ratings firms.</i><p>I believe that could be re-worded like this, and essentially mean the same thing:<p><i>In 1936, as part of reforms under the new Banking Act, the U.S. government mandated that federally regulated banks could no longer hold securities that weren't rated investment-grade by at least two [kindergarten kids with crayons].</i><p>Why are rating agencies, who appear to be unaccountable to anyone, given such a key role in banking law? This law appears to be in place to protect the stability of banks, but what happens if the rating measurement system is flawed? I was listening to comments made by Warren Buffet post crisis on the rating agencies. His position, to summarize, appeared to be, well, the agencies may not be perfect, but the market has need of their services, so we essentially need to have them. I'm not so sure this is the wisest course, at least not without some form of accountability added in. If individual investors can do their own research on investments, then banks can too. As the article points out:<p><i>The record was so unreliable that it would be ""still more responsible,"" Mr. Palyi growled, to ""stop the publication of ratings altogether.""</i><p>An interesting read along with this article is another one entitled <i>Bad Credit: How S&P, Moody’s and Fitch Helped Cause the Housing Bubble</i>.<p><a href=""http://www.bnet.com/blog/financial-business/bad-credit-how-s-p-moody-8217s-and-fitch-helped-cause-the-housing-bubble/5062"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bnet.com/blog/financial-business/bad-credit-how-s...</a><p>An excerpt:<p><i>If large financial firms masterminded the scam, stuffing junk mortgages into securities, CDOs and other instruments, the credit agencies were their able shills, rubber-stamping whatever paper came their way with an investment-grade rating.<p>As Sen. Ted Kaufman, D-Del., said this morning in a congressional hearing on the role of the rating agencies, “The big thing that was missing was the referees on the field.”<p>Or more accurately, the referees were paid off.<p>The ratings agencies business model is based on a flagrant conflict of interest — they’re paid by the firms whose credit they evaluate. That makes them vulnerable to pressure from investment banks and securities issuers, which naturally want a bullet-proof rating in order to attract investors.</i>",1289148696

And one might argue that it's pretty problematic that, e.g., with the function ""0 if x≤0, e^{-1/x^2} if x>0"", a Taylor series at any positive point will be wrong for all negative numbers, and a Taylor series at any nonnegative point will be wrong for all positive numbers... well, I dunno, touching half of the entire range of a curve is still a lot (an infinite amount, in fact).<p>One could imagine a bunch of functions pieced together to make a smooth function (e.g. ""e^{-1/x^2} * e^{-1/(x-1)^2} for 0<x<1, e^{-1/(x-1)^2} * e^{-1/(x-2)^2} for 1<x<2, ..."") whose Taylor series are all accurate only over a small, finite domain.

Do VC's and Investors really take that much of the company? How much influence do they hold over a company they invest in?<p>Apple was a public company at the time, and Steve Jobs was forced to resign by the board, just like any other employee can be forced to resign for whatever reason (unless they're in control of the majority of board, ala Mark Zuckerberg). He still owned a large share in Apple after he was fired, which I believe he mostly sold off.<p>>> Why would a founder continue if they lost their ownership? Why would a founder give up ownership of their company in the first place? Isn't one of the prominent appealing aspects of the start-up world to own your own company?<p>Most good founders don't want to give up ownership, but if you want to receive funding from investors, as far as I know there's not really any alternative to giving up equity in your business.",1289146160

If you're in debt because of your startup, then when you get acquired you use that money to pay off your debts, and keep what's left over (after taxes, and all). If you're deeply in debt, then it may occupy a large sum of your money.<p>2. When your VCs and board own most of the company, they have the right to fire the CEO regardless of his founder status. This can be avoided as long as you keep the majority of shares. Influence varies from VC to VC, but I'd say their influence is proportional to the amount of the company they own. They only take as much as you let them take.<p>3. Being bought out and/or burned is probably the top reason why founders leave or sell out. When you've been doing a startup for several years and you're ready to move on, and someone offers you a big fat check for your company, it's hard to turn it down unless you're really passionate about your startup and are still willing to push it forward yourself.",1289145637

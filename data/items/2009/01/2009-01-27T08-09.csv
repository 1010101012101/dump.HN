451834,comment,449361,450795,0,0,thwarted,,,"See, but C, and the x86 architecture, has none of that, or it all can be changed (like calling conventions), and yet all languages and VMs can be implemented in C.  Despite the explicit lack of support for those things, many C libraries are available with specific language bindings.<p>That being said, those things can be _defined_ for a VM that still uses a flat address space and direct memory manipulation model of the x86 architecture.  There is no support for objects or garbage collection or module interfaces in assembly or C, yet those things exist on top of it in languages that are implemented in C and run on x86 (or any usable architecture).  There has to be a superset of many languages' conventions that can be used to define the semantics of calls, types, data structures, objects, garbage collection, modules, dynamic dispatch.  This already exists somewhat as the ELF (and other) executable formats for things written in C.",1233046680

I cannot turn off the loud click or turn down its volume on my phone and many of my acquaintances have also tried with no success.<p>While not very nice from a philosophical viewpoint it is actually a good measure. Those phone cameras can get pretty annoying and very disturbing. Now with the clicking sound I can identify the offender and become aware that I had my picture taken.<p>There is a downside, too - when I am in the library or during lectures taking dozens of pictures of some paperwork can be very unpleasant for others.<p>I think the privacy of the individual is a lot more valuable than the ""freedom to not make a clicking sound"" ;-).",1233044996

If America had kept pursuing its comparative advantage, we would still be trading beaver skins to the British for manufactured goods.  Instead we took a protectionist stance and allowed our fledging industry a shield from foreign competition so that it could develop.  This is what every industrialized nation has done, even all of the ""Asian Tigers.""  The only places that haven't done so have been forced into ""free-trade"" under colonialism or quasi-colonialism, where they get to do great things like send all of the countries bananas out to another power in exchange for a few luxury cars for the elite ruling few.  Back when Ireland was in a colonial type situation, it had the distinction of being a net exporter of food during The Great Potato Famine.",1233043406

One side of the government wants you find yield, the other punishes you for finding that yield.<p>At the end of the day, you&#x27;re just going to make people find that yield (they have to) and you won&#x27;t increase tax revenue.

Each time we had growth in technology that had the potential to displace a huge number of workers that technology also enabled a massive decrease in the costs of transactions (railroads, motor vehicles, the internet, etc). This allowed a massive growth in the economy which enabled these displaced workers to find new jobs. Also consider that the growth in technology didn&#x27;t eliminate jobs, but it shifted them. The technology of old still required a mostly proportional human energy input to produce output. New technology decreased that proportion, but it didn&#x27;t eliminate it.<p>This last point is the difference that this new wave of automation has compared to the waves of past. It is unprecedented in human history to be facing a future where human effort can be multiplied by such enormous multiples that the value of labor approaches zero. This coming automation revolution would have to simultaneously grow the economy to greater proportions that automation reduces the cost of labor.

What we seem to see instead is that businesses seem to be concerned they will be carrying the cost and investors seem to be worried it will cut into profits.<p>2) I assume that&#x27;s true for me, too, of course -- presumably, I don&#x27;t pay income/payroll taxes either, I just pass along the cost of those taxes to my employer. My employer, as given, just passes those costs along to consumers. Consumer just figures in the costs of goods/services and calculates their asking price for their market offerings accordingly...<p>So nobody pays taxes?<p>It seems more likely to me that rather than people &quot;just&quot; passing costs along whole is that <i>everybody</i> pays the tax by finding some economic balance between what they can/must pass on and what they can/must absorb. How much is passed along probably depends on how competitive the market for each exchange is along every cascade and how price sensitive buyers are.<p>> Taxing corporations doesn&#x27;t produce magic money<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody really thinks it does.

For pure interchangeable commodities with robust markets, this is less of a problem, but for many real world assets (including real estate) this is not the case.<p>Note that while real estate is already subject to ad valorem taxes (and other value-based policies, such as eminent domain), valuation is not at all free from contention even with those taxes as just one piece of the overall tax picture; if wealth-based taxes were the primary tax system, that problem would be magnified.<p>> How do you determine income objectively?<p>If you can value wealth objectively, you can value income objectively, since income is just a subset of the changes in wealth. The problems in income valuation are problems in wealth valuation (which is why, e.g., capital assets are valued at sale for income purposes, which becomes less viable of a solution to the problem of valuation if you aren&#x27;t taxing the change in wealth but taxing the wealth in each year it was held.)",1373568669

That being said, if you simply hand out 3 trillion a year then you would be effectively taxing everyone by (3T/total wealth) then redistributing it does nothing because you&#x27;ve also taxed EVERYONE by that same amount.<p>To follow up my argument:<p>3T/16T is 25% that would be the inflation rate per year, of course each year it would increase as follows:<p>(3 * 1.25)/(16 * 1.25)
(3 * 1.25 * 1.25)/(16 * 1.25 * 1.25) 
etc.<p>Of course this doesn&#x27;t take into consideration the approximate 1% growth or what ever it currently is. The point remains that the redistribution of wealth will decrease the amount the currency is worth. Currency that is handed out WITHOUT something being traded for it does not apply to &quot;currency circulation.&quot; Instead what you have is a situation where every person is taxed at about 25% and receives slightly less than that tax in return (which was used to disburse the collected taxes).<p>This is why NO COUNTRY ON EARTH gives out tax money to all of its citizens.

The idea that &quot;there is always a cost for doing something&quot; is trotted out so often, and almost every time, there&#x27;s ignorance of the fact that the  intent is for the benefit to be higher than the cost.  Enforcing contracts has a &quot;cost&quot;, maintaining a police and legal system has a &quot;cost&quot;, a road/highway system has a cost, maintaining a currency has a cost, regulating food so there&#x27;s no arsenic in it has a cost, etc etc etc.  The entropy and friction created by these things are considered to be far below the benefits to economic efficiency (lowering barriers to trade, reducing non-productive expenditure on security, etc).  Saying that introducing friction into an economy causes the world to collapse and completely ignoring the potential for economic gains in efficiency is beyond ludicrous.<p>I may be misreading that last sentence, but luckily the other possible interpretation is equally ludicrous.  The idea that corporations paying their consumers who then buy their goods will cause the world to collapse is even more ridiculous than the previous claim.  How do you think the economy functions exactly?  The wages that employers pay to their employees ARE the money they use to buy products from employers (whether theirs or someone else&#x27;s).  &quot;Any college economics textbook&quot; can tell you this.  In fact, if you partition each person&#x27;s wages into subsistence wages (i.e. basic income) and &quot;extra&quot; wages, corporations are already doing exactly what you&#x27;re claiming will cause the world to collapse.  The only difference is that right now it&#x27;s being done horribly inefficiently, and the gaps in coverage (unemployed people) have an even more inefficient system servicing them, welfare.",1373567435

Though they had been replaced by rail for long-distance haulage and by steam engines for driving machinery, they still plowed fields, hauled wagons and carriages short distances, pulled boats on the canals, toiled in the pits, and carried armies into battle. But the arrival of the internal combustion engine in the late nineteenth century rapidly displaced these workers, so that by 1924 there were fewer than two million.

It will eventually replace even more demanding ones, such as knowledge workers. Infact, only human creativity seems to be the only thing which we can&#x27;t automate <i>YET</i>, but perhaps eventually will be able to. What this means is that the current capitalistic system <i>has to fail</i> eventually because we lose jobs, and it seems very certain that automation is going to be the beginning of the end.<p>This has been happening in China too -- recently(late last year) there was news about Foxconn replacing over a <i>million jobs</i> with robots in China.

For those left in the job market:<p>- remuneration would likely improve<p>- only motivated people would be left, so &quot;pretending&quot; to enjoy a job and all other kinds of fakery diminishes<p>- artificial competition for jobs would decrease drastically<p>- the ability to change jobs becomes extremely fluid on both sides of the table(with liberalized hire/fire policies [employer-side] plus a lack of worry about winding up in the street [worker-side])<p>This is a very large net benefit to the motivated. The sooner those who don&#x27;t want to be there get to stop working, the better for the rest. An &quot;arts, sports, and leisure (which may take the form of beer or video games)&quot; is going to happen, and we should be happy to allow it for those who want nothing more.",1373565758
6027815,comment,6025999,6027481,2,0,nkoren,,,"Living on the dole is indeed terrible for people -- but it&#x27;s terrible because it&#x27;s a poverty trap. A poverty trap isn&#x27;t created by supporting people who don&#x27;t earn a wage: it&#x27;s created by <i>withdrawing</i> support for people who <i>do</i> earn a wage (or engage in other forms of value-creation which the dole administrators disapprove of). Because a person on the dole is micro-managed in their activities, they are unable to volunteer or work part-time without risking losing their one reliable source of income. This is exactly what traps them in a life of unrewarding idleness.<p>Your proposal would create a poverty trap in exactly the same way as the dole (in fact this <i>is</i> how the dole currently works in Britain -- you&#x27;ve just described something quite akin to the Workfare program, aka slavery for the wageless). Unconditional basic income is not like this at all. It isn&#x27;t paying people to be idle: it&#x27;s paying people no matter how much they earn. Because you can never lose your basic income, you are never disincentivised from working. Thus people can volunteer, raise children, care for elderly parents -- or work part-time, or full-time, or in whatever situation they prefer -- without ever losing their safety net. This allows for nire diverse forms of value-creation to be created than in the kind of micro-managed nanny-state that you describe.",1373565748

You don&#x27;t spend your evenings clipping coupons all the coupons you can (which would save you some pennies). Or if you do, you don&#x27;t stay up late to do it.

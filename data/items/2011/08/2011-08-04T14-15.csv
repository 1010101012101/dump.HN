But a KissMetrics-wide unique ID doesn't proof that such information is shared.<p>Even with all security efforts in place, a user can still be tracked (By IP and browser/system settings), and this data can still be shared. I do e-commerce profiling, and while I don't really need a flash cookie, I also don't really need your permission to scan my own servers logs: it was you who made the decision to disclose that information to me.<p>> However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even retroactively). This information can then be shared with other sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine separate sessions into coherent user profiles.",1312469824

But if they really do cover just software, then you just patented bits of speech, literally.  The patent system was never intended to cover that stuff, and you only got away it with because of insufficient guidance from the courts over the past couple decades.  I believe this situation will be rectified eventually, and patents like yours will once again not be allowed.<p>> ""... and that people are patenting really obvious ideas.""<p>This is exactly the case in the lodsys hubub, as just one timely example.  You don't have to look to hard to find many others.<p>> ""there is no need for reform, that I can see, as all these allegedly bogus patents would be quickly thrown out if they really were as obvious as is claimed and if there really was the abundance of prior art, as is claimed.""<p>You're joking right?  In all the discussions swirling around this issue, rarely do even the most intransigent defenders of the status-quo say that there is <i>absolutely no</i> need for reform.  Even the most obviously bogus software patents require millions of dollars to invalidate; combined with the patent office's utter inability to properly evaluate software patents, the system is ripe for racketeering.",1312469524

SICP is all about the beauty and interest of computation for it's own sake, but it doesn't really engage with solving the kinds of problems most software is written for. I think we're inadvertently dissuading people who would make great programmers, but who see computer science as a means rather than an end and need to relate algorithms and data structures to practical problems.<p>There is clearly value in CS for its own sake and academics are obviously inclined towards this, but I think dismissing the practical application of CS is unhelpful. If we segregate programmers into 'Computer Scientists' and 'Software Engineers', we lose the most precious part - the bit in between, where radical ideas meet great engineering.<p>I want to see more diversity in computing and I think SICP as an introductory course is a serious hindrance to that aim. We don't teach children to read and write by starting with linguistic theory. I think we should teach software the same way - start with Dick and Jane and work our way up to lambda calculus.",1312469476

It's a kind of webapp starter project- the code is the product.<p>http://armhold.com/quick<p>The target customer is an entrepreneur/dev that wants to get a basic webapp up and running quickly. It doesn't do anything novel or earth-shattering; it's just a project shell that gives you some common basic features that you can use to build out your site.<p>I often see jobs posted to sites like oDesk or Elance asking for a basic website with these kinds of features. The idea is to sell this code as a starter project, so you can get your webapp running faster and not have to worry about implementing boilerplate stuff like:<p>* totally automated user accounts (sign-up/login/change-password/forgot-password, etc)<p>* login via Facebook or use local account (uses BCrypt for storing pw hashes)<p>* drop-dead easy ""you must be logged in to access this page"" annotations<p>* ""contact us"" with CAPTCHA protection<p>* smart https/http switching for secure/insecure pages<p>* uses H2 as an integrated database, so it also saves you the hassle of setting up MySQL (though it's a simple change if you do in fact want to use an existing DB).<p>Again, none of this is rocket-science, but it can take a surprising amount of time to get these basic things working properly.<p>The main downside to this of course if that you're subject to my choice of tech (Java, Wicket, JPA/Hibernate).<p>Do you think this is worth pursuing? Do you think it's worth $199?  Would you like to use it to build your next project? :-)<p>All constructive feedback appreciated, thank you.",1312468907

You're really going to argue that every trick in the book has been tried, and that the amount that non-lying economists recommended to spend wasn't feasible?""<p>Actually, they're all of a kind. One of my core problems with Keynesianism is that you must treat ""government investment opportunities"" like any other resource; you've got low hanging fruit, where you put in a dollar and get $4 in wealth back, you've got a series of barely-above-break-even, then a sea of places you can put a dollar and get back $0.75. You can't just assume that because you've spent a dollar under duress you're getting more than a dollar back in value; economics is built on that but the logic only holds when one is <i>freely choosing</i> to spend the dollar because you expect to get more than a dollar back.<p>Keynesianism isn't about just spending wildly, it's all about spending where you get over-unity results, and even if I believed in the power of a massive centralized authority to correct determine where those opportunities are (which I don't), there's a huge problem with that, which is that we already <i>spent</i> a large number of those dollars on those over-unity projects. We don't hang around in the boom times and let our roads go to pot on purpose so that when the recession comes we have good investment opportunities for stimulus. It is unlikely that that is even a good idea. So the goverment is trying to stimulate into a market where the low-hanging fruit is mostly gone anyways.<p>Maybe this works in 1930. Maybe this works in the Third World. In a developed country there's [feasible] no way to <i>PRODUCTIVELY</i> spend three trillion dollars. Now... <i>UN</i>productive spending we can do, but even under the dictates of Keynesianism that's a bad idea! Sucking a dollar out of the economy (as debt or taxes) to get back $0.75 in value is simply a straight-up net loss.<p>I find the theory that government spending is producing a lot of net loss of wealth dovetails rather nicely with the <i>real</i> economic results we are experiencing, as opposed to the predictions of those who are implementing this policy.<p>21st century Keynesianism has some enormous leaps of logic in it that I have not been able to follow wherein it is simply assumed that the government can find things to spend that are stimulative. I'm not even sure where this stuff is supposed to come from, even in theory. You can't even just wave around the word ""crumbling infrastructure"" because you can't just wave a wand and make everybody a construction worker, so you're bounded there.<p>Every trick was tried, and that only got us a hundred billion or so, so our politicians just kept spending more anyhow. Guess what? It's disastrous, not stimulative, and as far as I can tell, even Keynes would have said so in advance.",1312468198

But your checking account says $100, and the loanee's checking account says $80, for a total of $180<p>you should learn about accounting. the loanee also has an $80 debt to the bank. no money is created.  in fact, even if the bank didn't exist, in your fantasy land, basically everyone would be ""money counterfeiters"".<p>let's construct a scenario. when you loan your aunt $100, you give her $100, and then you sign a little contract with her indicating she owes you $100. you now have an asset worth $100 (the contract), and she now has a fresh $100 bill. oh my god, you just magically created $100! you're a counterfeiter!<p>when you deposit money in a bank, you loan them your money, which they then loan out. your checking account is essentially a low risk, pooled, variably timed bond that you buy from the bank.<p>i have a question for you though. do you believe in free markets? if so, then why do you oppose fractional reserve banking, which, at its fundamental core, is a contractual agreement between two parties?",1312467786

In many areas in California or the East Coast, this positions one squarely in the hard working upper-middle class, and strict budgeting will be essential.

She grew up with a pre-tax annual income of less than $10,000.<p>While it's inaccurate an potentially damaging to misrepresent the degree to which it truly is the <i>super</i>-rich that benefit most dramatically from our economy, it also seems just as potentially damaging to write as though we really <i>are</i> all in the middle-class.

However, it is evident that you are not a formally trained economist.<p>Economics is <i>not</i> closely tied to politics. If you ever want to have a look at what real economics is, please go to <a href=""http://ssrn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ssrn.com/</a> and read some economic articles on subjects that interest you. One thing that you will rapidly notice is that politics has almost nothing to do with formal, academic Economics (and this consitutes the <i>great</i> bulk of the activity that goes on in the field of Economics).<p>It is worthwhile to distinguish between normative economics and positive economics. Positive economics, which constitutes the majority of the discipline, seeks to describe, explain, and record economic phenomena. Normative economics, which is the louder minority, seeks to prescribe solutions to problems by using economic theory.<p>The problem with modern Economics is that the loudest voices within the field are listened to because of their political viewpoints and not their economic expertise. Dr. Krugman in particular has the habit of mixing normative and positive economics without providing a careful distinction between the two. This is a huge problem, and it makes the entire field look bad. However, what can economists that are not popular do about this? The mass media has very little interest in impact studies of obscure policy changes done in third world countries, so we just keep churning away in the background.<p>While I would not say that George Box is wrong outright, I would say that this quote from him is not entirely accurate as it could be when applied to Economic modelling. You see, by definition an Economic model is merely a simplification of a real world phenomena. Of course, all simplifications are ""wrong"" because they are not intended to be ""right"" they are merely intended to be approximations.<p>Economic models are more prone to error than Mathematical models and models in the Natural sciences because they are, in essence, brutally simple models of Human behaviour. Their usefulness is not subject to their ability to be implemented, but is is subject to the context of the problem at hand and what the expectations are for the model.<p>For example, one thing that I did recently was to analyze some time series data to analyze a market for seasonality. The predictions of my model for the next two quarters were not even close to being exact, but the seasonality estimates were spot on. A model's usefulness must be determined within the context of its overall purpose.",1312467341

2846016,comment,2844059,2845873,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""...I guess voting in favour of such things is inevitable when not all voters are taxpayers.""</i><p>I get the premise of this logic, i.e., that poor people don't pay taxes and therefore don't care about spending taxpayer dollars. I've seen it presented hundreds of times. But I think, in all honesty, that such a theory is giving the poor too much credit. It assumes that the poor are making conscious decisions based on rational evaluations of their economic incentives. I'm not convinced they think that way. Furthermore, I'm not convinced that they're even informed enough to know what they're doing when they vote on such things.<p>Some of the blame lies on the voters for voting without understanding, sure. But the politicians -- many of whom are paid for by lobbies -- bear greater responsibility for selling bullshit to underinformed voters, and for coucing the bullshit in emotionally manipulative ways.",1312466870

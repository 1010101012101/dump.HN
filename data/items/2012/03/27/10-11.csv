According to In The Plex, the reason that Google bought YouTube was because that race had been won by YouTube at that point, and Google had come to that realization. There are also parts in there that quote the founders talking about their lax attitude towards copyright infringement being a good thing, and it also attributes part of Google Video's failure against YouTube to their over-worrying about making sure that copyright was appropriately respected, while YouTube was letting things run wild. The tough-on-copyright-infringement behavior of YT came later. I'm not equating them with MU, I'm saying that you're dead wrong about YouTube's past.",1332845991

The headline is wildly misleading - he didn't opt out of the buy-out, his small equity stake was bought. The value of the buy-out is irrelevant, and it's unlikely that the offer he got was off-the-charts above what he could get somewhere else - He said it was a standard offer, so most likely it was what he made before + n%.",1332845982

In fact and this is one of the most amazing things in physics, if you demand the system to be invariant under a change of phase everywhere, a symmetry called U(1), you will automatically find electromagnetism! A fundamental force of nature is a consequence of symmetry.<p>This is the unifying principle of physics as we know it: the Standard Model. Except of course for gravity on one hand and the fact that everything has mass on the other hand (which these symmetries forbid). That is why the search for Higgs boson is so important. It provides a way of breaking symmetries so particles can have mass but still interact with various forces. (The reasons why symmetry forbids massive particles are complicated).",1332845747

Instead it's based on the observation that many (maybe most?) cancerous cells over-express the protein CD47 on their surfaces as a survival mechanism in order to prevent macrophages and dendrites from taking them out.<p>If successful - and that's a big if, because I'd be willing to wager this treatment will never see the light of day - if successful, the drug would break the CD47 recognition mechanism by blocking the protein with antibodies, thereby allowing the patient's immune system to attack the malfunctioning cells. In a way this would be more elegant than aiming at re-starting apoptosis pathways or blocking the expression of angiogenesis factors because the specific mechanisms employed by cancer cells to do so seem to vary greatly as you said.",1332845724

3760782,comment,3760447,3760447,19,0,drostie,,,"The simplest way I've seen to explain Noether's theorem comes from Feynman's Messenger Lectures.<p>Suppose -- as we have in modern physics -- that the laws of physics can be phrased in a certain way. Namely:<p>(1) There is some number we can calculate for all of the possible paths that an object could take from point A to point B. We call this number the ""action"" of the path.<p>(2) Of all of the paths that an object <i>can</i> take, the one which it <i>does</i> has a stationary action -- meaning that if you wiggle the path a little bit, the action remains the same. This can happen for example if the action is at a minimum for that path -- if you're at a minimum then you can't go any lower, and so there cannot be a proportionate response to any slight change in path.<p>This work was already done before Noether -- the observation, I mean, that there is a definition of ""action"" for all known laws in physics such that you can phrase those laws as a stationary-action principle. An example is light. All of these complicated rules of lenses and light bending when it enters water can be phrased as the much simpler rule that ""light always takes the least-time path."" The action of the path is then the time it takes for light to travel along that path from A to B.<p>Now, suppose the action has a continuous symmetry. For example, it might be the case that if A and B were moved a centimeter to the right, to two new points A' and B', then the actions on the corresponding paths between them would remain the same.<p>Now construct a new path: We go from A to B like so: we go from A to A', follow the physical path to B', then go to B, rather than following the physical path from A to B.<p>Call these two paths:<p>(1) A  B<p>(2) A : A'  B' : B<p>You have two competing facts. First off:<p>(1) the symmetry: action(A'  B') = action(A  B)<p>(2) stationary action: action(A : A'  B' : B) = action(A  B).<p>In other words, as long as the little wiggles described by "":"" are very small, the stationary action principle holds and we don't change the action when we move from a physical path.<p>It must then be the case that action(A : A') = - action(B : B') in some sense. In other words, there is some quantity local to both A and B which is exactly the same -- it is the susceptibility of the action to changes if you shifted in one direction or another. The big symmetry also forces some little number to be constant while this thing is taking whatever path it takes.<p>Whenever you have a stationary-action principle -- which we have for gravity and electromagnetism -- then Noether's principle holds and symmetries in the action become conserved quantities of the physics.<p>We can also calculate some of these susceptibilities for the most common action principles: we find that symmetry with respect to space-translation (moving 1cm to the side) conserves momentum in that direction. We find that symmetry with respect to rotations about a point conserves angular momentum about that point. We find that if the action remains the same from from one second to another, then the energy is conserved -- literally if someone tells you they've got a ""free energy device,"" they're saying ""the laws of physics that this thing uses won't be the same tomorrow as they are today.""<p>But it can get even more interesting. For example, wavefunctions have a phase, but shifting the phase does not change any observables. This shift turns out to have relativistic consequences, and can be associated with conservation of charge. (That's as I understand it, but I only saw a half-sketch of the proof and I haven't worked it out myself, as I have for these other examples.)",1332843199

Netbooks (7"" to 10"") is especially bad idea.\nYou should consider her eyesight - small, high dpi display very close to the eyes is bad.\nConsider scoliosis probability - because keyboard is fixed right below the screen and can't disconnected (except 1-2 special rare big notebooks).\nConsider RSI (repetitive strain injury) to hands, neck etc., hands especially.

Developed hand RSI is unbearably painful, considerably limits keyboard usage and heals very, very bad.\nThis is just what I would consider. Ask a medic and he'll tell you more.<p>tl;dr\nNo notebooks and probably tablets for 10 year old. Buy adjustable table, adjustable chair, classic desktop with some ergonomic keyboard and mouse (both with wrist support). Set up timed lockout on the PC, like 10 minutes every 1-2 hours.

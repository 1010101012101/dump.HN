You don't always get expansion of the extracellular fluid space with chronic kidney disease due to hypertension; with some tubulointerstitial diseases, you develop salt-wasting nephropathies. Perhaps these were the hypertensive patients who were referenced in the article, voraciously eating salt due to a deficiency caused by their kidney disease? I'd like to see more data before being willing to overturn dogma, but it's not the most outlandish idea I've heard all day. Still, the authors' conclusions are most likely wrong.<p>2. There's a group at MGH doing a randomized clinical trial in which they are administering intravenous salt and measuring near-term blood pressure response. It's a one-off exposure, but it will be interesting to better nail down the relationship between serum sodium content and blood pressure via experiment rather than epidemiology.",1317023869
3038013,story,,,1,0,mahalkitasinuka,"Online Insurance Quotes","http://youronlineinsuranceagent.com ","What to Consider When Comparing Online Insurance Quotes\nWhen you make a list of some of the most important insurance policies, you just cannot keep auto insurance out of the list. It is true that other policies have their own benefits, but you just cannot go without a car insurance policy in place. The good thing about auto insurance, and all other types of insurance, is that you easily shop for the best one without having to go out of your home. This is possible because online insurance quotes are available for all. \nAlthough its nothing less than a blessing for consumers to be able to use online insurance quotes, it can sometimes turn into bane. The thing is that though dedicated insurance buyers can expect a better rate online, these cyber-consumers are still very much at the mercy of a number of different rating engines. Not only this, they also come face to face with a variety of question sets that end up producing widely divergent quotes. This makes consumers worried about not being able to make the right call. \nThe simple solution to this problem is that you should take some time and conduct an in-depth research before picking a quote. You need to ensure that you are using a popular site that helps you get online insurance quotes from a variety of insurance providers. Sometimes, you see sites where they claim to provide you with the best insurance quotes, but mostly these quotes come from only one or two insurance providers. This keeps you from getting a perfect deal because they comparison sites make such packages look good for you that are actually not in your favor. \nWhile paying attention to this particular point, you should also be aware of the fact that not all sites are going to perform in the same way. For instance, some sites will be much more responsive and quick as compared to the others. They ask for a few questions and guide you through the process to purchase a policy. You need to find such sites to compare online quotes. Similarly, there are some sites that are quick and offer quotes from a variety of issuers but offer no information about features a policy may have. For instance, you should be able to get information about the benefits included in a plan along with the premiums. Here, you should also bear in mind that some sites deliberately omit important information. Though they offer low online insurance quotes, they lay their emphasis on luring you into making a purchase. Once you fall for those offers, you realize that the rates are low because the levels of excess are on the higher side. \nThe fact of the matter is that whether you want auto insurance or another type of insurance coverage, it is always a good idea to compare insurance quotes. Just make sure you take your time and select the right site for comparison. It may take some time to conduct this research, but it saves you wasting your money on taking out a coverage that is not right for you.",1317023844

3037953,story,,,1,0,devraj,"USB 3.0 Speeds Up Performance on External Devices",,"The USB connector has been one of the greatest success stories in the history of computing, with more than 2 billion USB-connected devices sold to date. But in an age of terabyte hard drives, the once-cool throughput of 480 megabits per second that a USB 2.0 device can realistically provide just doesn't cut it any longer.<p>USB 3.0 (aka ""SuperSpeed USB"") promises to increase performance by a factor of 10, pushing the theoretical maximum throughput of the connector all the way up to 4.8 gigabits per second, or processing roughly the equivalent of an entire CD-R disc every second. USB 3.0 devices will use a slightly different connector, but USB 3.0 ports are expected to be backward-compatible with current USB plugs, and vice versa. USB 3.0 should also greatly enhance the power efficiency of USB devices, while increasing the juice (nearly one full amp, up from 0.1 amps) available to them. That means faster charging times for your iPod--and probably even more bizarre USB-connected gear like the toy rocket launchers and beverage coolers that have been festooning people's desks.<p>The USB 3.0 spec is nearly finished, with consumer gear now predicted to come in 2010. Meanwhile, a host of competing high-speed plugs--DisplayPort, eSATA, and HDMI--will soon become commonplace on PCs, driven largely by the onset of high-def video. Even FireWire is looking at an imminent upgrade of up to 3.2 gbps performance. The port proliferation may make for a baffling landscape on the back of a new PC, but you will at least have plenty of high-performance options for hooking up peripherals.",1317022345

First of all: A big link to the next chapter at the bottom. Some of the chapters also ended a little abruptly (e.g. Applicability). Even though the chapters are quite small, it's still important to have <i>some</i> kind of ""conclusion"". It could be just one or two sentences, but you need to show that ""I'm finished with this topic for now"".<p>I'd love to see more examples about different of modules.

That is exactly what Lua lanes and the other package are doing.  And what is described in the Programming in Lua book by Robert I.<p>But you can't access the same lua_State from 2 C threads, and you can't share data structures between 2 separate lua_States -- you would have to serialize all your data structures the message-pass between them.  So if Lua had an interpreter lock, it would enable a Lua-threading library which Python and Ruby have.  The lock would just belong in the lua_State and not be an actual C global.  (not saying it should add this; just pointing out the difference)<p>You're use of the word ""slow"" doesn't have any meaning.  What I meant is that Python and Ruby are not slow in the sense that you couldn't write ""scalable"" CGIs style with them in Hipp's style IF they didn't have horrendous startup time.  That is, once the interpreter is started, you can do a LOT of work in 50ms of Python or Ruby (which is exactly what sites that serve billions of page view a month are doing).  It's just that loading the interpreter can take upwards of 100ms with a lot of libraries.  So with those languages, people use persistent servers rather than what Hipp is advocating.<p>In Lua you could have a persistent C program and initialize a new lua_State for every request.  That would be the moral equivalent of CGI, without the fork(), since all the state is wiped between every request.  But, getting back to the original point, that wouldn't retain the ease of administration that Hipp wants because it wouldn't work with inetd.",1317020604

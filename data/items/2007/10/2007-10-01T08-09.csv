2) a Gold level powerseller told us: ""I have found that Auctiva has very little ""value-added"" over the plain vanilla eBay tools. My hope is that your final product will be an improvement both in ease of use and cost over eBay/Auctiva"",  which also hints at our goals. There is a lot we can do to help sellers optimize, and more than that, introduce some real ""ease-of use"" into this market.<p>All the initial feedback we have had suggests we are on track with both. I'd be happy to discuss any insights you may have to help us improve, drop me a line at kul at auctomatic.com.",1191228508

61535,comment,61333,61400,0,0,jsnx,,,"What about a good shell environment, stability, package management?<p>An OS is a lot of different things. It's too bad that the OS market is dominated by superficial concern with 'interoperability' (defined in the narrowest sense) and appearance. You can't get the best of everything, all in one nice package. Make sure the things you want the best of are really the things you can make the best use of!",1191227918

After I finally figured out the basics of partitioning a drive, setting the locale and time, I didn't 'reinstall' again until, three years later, I switched to Gentoo Linux.",1191227482
61533,comment,61333,61333,0,0,jsnx,,,"The author hints at a major issue with corporate deployments -- old machines. It's all fine, well and good that Vista runs on machines it shipped with; but many large shops have to turn down an upgrade to Vista just because the performance is egregiously bad on older machines. By extension, it is unwise for developers to assume that Vista will be there when they need it, making it unsuitable as a platform for the near future.",1191227322

61531,comment,61450,61450,0,0,hga,,,"The AntiPatterns book says (without citation, although this seems to match my personal observations) that only 1 in 5 programmers ""get"" abstraction.<p>This has a lot of implications; they pointed out the one for ""democratic"" design processes (those with a clue get outvoted, thus the architecture of so many systems is garbage), but this obviously extends to this ""LISP is a ball of mud"" (Moses) approach of designing and implementing a small language in which to program most of your stuff.<p>And in any language.  LISP is used as an example since this is its natural style of use and it's lot easier, but if you can't get the proper abstractions agreed upon in the first place, it matters little how good or bad the language you'll then try to implement them in, boiler plate style or LISP....",1191226860

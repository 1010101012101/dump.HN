However, I will say that your explanation comes with a pretty big assumption: that a library sits on some 2-dimensional spectrum from bad to good. If you don&#x27;t subscribe to this notion, libraries don&#x27;t improve; they simply change. If you accept this, then you begin to see why arbitrarily changing parts of a software package without even trying to understand the consequences of those changes is madness.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I disagree with you, just trying to point out a spot you might have overlooked.",1371862543

Knowing his life will be over, he was brave enough to continue believing in his citizen&#x27;s duty and pledge to the Constitution and all American people (not to the Administration that just happened to be more tyrannical as the days go by) and decided he couldn&#x27;t stand the abuse anymore. I personally believe the only reason we do not have a full speed tyranny in this country and more wars with american troops involved all over the world is because of the people like Assange, Bradley and Snowden. They put a real time breaks on internal abuse; many times before pulling the trigger those in charge ask themselves: &quot;damn what if another &#x27;traitor&#x27; will leak this out and my name [and crimes] will come to the light?&quot;. We have grown very dangerous government that WE founded and WE continue to pay for and we seem to forget about that...<p>But in NO MEANS the Government will EVER let him off the hook. Never. Its not that they are vicious or anything, its simply because the system is broken and corrupt to its inner core (by corruption I do not mean someone giving an envelope under the table to win some contract. I am talking about high ranked generals that with no serious evidence just by &quot;believing we are protecting american people&quot; are sending thousands on the war the they damn well know is not being waged in the name of security, but the name of satisfying Industrial Military Complex, in a monetary way). You can see military lock down of entire cities due to the riots on the streets, and yet they will not change their mind, because that would be a warm invitation to anyone else witnessing shit being done under government seal to come forward. It would be a total reboot of the system. Another 4th of July. And what they think about founding fathers [1] is not what you would assume they do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oP1Ke70Mi8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oP1Ke70Mi8</a>",1371861323

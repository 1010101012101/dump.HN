This talk sums up a why most of the things done in computing (like web programming) is not done well. It starts by looking at what humans are. If only less than 1% of us is intrinsically interested and looking for really new ideas, and also must have ways of discarding the mediocre to bad new ideas, it becomes clear why it is so hard to have new ideas that change our outlook (epistemological stance). In computing today that is the reason we have so little new ideas, Still this talk is the first step in realizing what to avoid when having new ideas. This approach did yield me some new ideas like message passing systems, scalability like the internet and massive parallel processing to solve the manycore dilemma we are faced with today.<p>View with VLC.

The employer wants to pay them as little as possible - but the candidate can ask whatever the market allows, as much as possible, and if his name's that good, he will be able to gouge the employer for as much as he can get. And if the employer listens long enough, he'll find that all of the others will all seem to be adopting the same gouging tactic, for exactly the same amount - like a cartel structure.<p>Basically, you're going to end up with a small clique of experienced coders circulating between firms, raking in the money and coming up with the same tired code they've been peddling to the same firms from day one. The incentive to come up with original solutions isn't there - they're not after hiring newbies who might have something new that could knock them off their perch.<p>In the meantime, businesses find themselves financially in a hole paying for these bloated whales, they're just as much in the dark as they've always been, their programs are just as rubbish, nothing new seems to work - why should it? Working code costs more money, so you might as well just issue new patches - and folding left and right.<p>There's more money to be made running a cartel of consultants than by opening the jobs market to newcomers, offering them training and keeping the market fresh, competitive, adaptive and, most of all, viable.",1284853919

1705216,comment,1705012,1705012,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm a more ""traditional"" type of employer -- I have technicians, they go to homes and businesses, they set things up and solve problems, and I don't mind hiring under-experienced techs so long as I think they're willing to learn.<p>I have a pretty good hunch why a lot of businesses aren't interested in doing this anymore: there is an extreme amount of external pressure not to do it. If one of my techs doesn't know how to do a particular thing right away, the client doesn't want to hear that. Instead, they want to hear that I'll give them a discount on the tech's time. If the tech makes a mistake, I have to cover the costs for making up for it. Even if a tech knows how to do something, but they're just out-of-practice at it, and they take 3 hours to do something that I could do in 1, I probably won't bill the client for a full 3 hours.<p>It creates a hardship on the business. The culture around the customer-business relationship in the U.S. has changed from the stereotypical 50's ideals to one where the lower price usually wins, and if you're competing on price, you can't afford to train people.<p>It doesn't help that there are an awful lot of people out there now that seem to think that they're worth a lot of money even if they don't know how to do a job. Go ahead and try telling a potential employee for a technical position, ""Well, you're not familiar with any of this, but we're willing to train you if you're willing to start at $10/hour"". Unless they're in high school, it probably won't fly.<p>Or, as another anecdote: one of the things that my business offers its clients is professionalism. Techs are supposed to show up polite, friendly, clean, and dressed for business casual. Repeatedly nagging my techs about their appearance hasn't helped; they still show up with bed hair, with cargo pants, with t-shirts not tucked in, despite that I pay them better than any of my competitors. I'm gonna have to get mean about this soon, and that makes me a little sad.",1284852847

1705176,comment,1705012,1705012,0,0,trevelyan,,,"As far as I'm aware from the economics blogosphere, arguments about ""structural unemployment"" are popular these days mostly in right wing think tanks. And they only seem popular there because hypothesizing that there are tons of jobs available for the unemployed permits one to reject Keynesian/Monetarist prescriptions for further fiscal/monetary stimulus.<p>I haven't run into any serious economist who believes in the idea, and certainly haven't read any proponents of the idea who are able to justify why this rate is allegedly 5-6 percent higher now than two years ago, or at pretty much any previous point in American history for that matter.<p>I wouldn't mind talking about this if others are interested. To me, the simplest evidence that this argument is dishonest is that its proponents don't seem to be acting consistently with their beliefs. If they really are right that the natural unemployment rate has risen, any further stimulus or monetary expansion will result in significant inflation which will need to be headed off by the Federal Reserve, and which would permit the organization to divest itself of its fairly risky mortgage-backed securities in the process. And this would be a zero-risk way to drive a stake through the heart of pretty much every left-leaning empiricist out there too....",1284851887

The next crash will not be because of anything related to ETFs or any type of shorting.  The next crash will be the result retail investors having unrealistic expectations about how fast the market will rise.  The 1990s and mid 2000s set unrealistic expectations about how fast the market will rise.  When retail investors are not pulling off double digit returns, they claim things are rigged and leave the market.  This is what will drop the markets again.

I think you could usefully sell a $30 computer (simple to program, cheap to make, flexible enough to be useful) in places like Africa etc to people who could not afford to have one otherwise but even a basic web browsing experience needs a lot of CPU cycles nowadays. Of course there are text-based browsers, but you might as well go with the $100 price point like OLPC and just look for subsidies. I have heard nothing about how programmable those are, for young hackers in poor countries, I hope there's access to python, js, or similar.<p>Closer to home, I would have quite liked to use the Playstation 3 as a computer, to the point that I learned quite a lot about the Cell chip inside it and started thinking about Linux distros again. But Sony made it non-expandable (boo), with no access to the GPU (WTF), were late with driver support (argh) and finally ditched the OS loader option entirely. They briefly hinted at giving away their 3d modeling engine but changed their minds about that too.<p>Now, I know they recoup the hardware development costs from royalties on the games and have an investment to protect, but with a little more patience, support, and faith in their own engineering instincts they would have been rewarded with PS3s popping up up at every science fair. People are nostalgic about their 80s computers out of all proportion to their quality because they were easy to do things with if you wanted.<p>I do think there's still room for lightweight and hackable products.

(I forget the economics term for it.)  It's why coupons and discounts for senior citizens exist.  Senior citizens and people willing to spend time clipping coupons often can't afford to pay regular prices, so businesses offer discounts where they still make a profit.  Some profit is better than none.  I'm sure Intel would love to produce high-end chips for people willing to pay, and low end chips for others.  But, the cost of designing and building two separate but similar products would probably be much higher than simply crippling high-end chips.  The alternative is that they only produce high-end (or low-end) chips and normal prices, driving low-end (high-end) customers to competitors, or they lower their high-end price and try to make up the difference in volume.<p>It does seem a little dirty to sell something to somebody, but restrict how they can use it.  But, Intel isn't just selling a chunk of silicon.  They are selling the work that went into shaping that silicon just so.  They could have designed it much more cheaply if it didn't need to do so much.  So, by buying the low-end chip, you aren't paying them for the extra effort they put in for their high-end customers.  If you want the extra benefit, then you must pay for the extra work.",1284851073

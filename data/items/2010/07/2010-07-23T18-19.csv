It's easy to set up (~2 minutes), incredibly easy to use (printing takes ~10 seconds), works with practically every printer ever made and supports nearly 500 different kinds of attachments.  You can watch an introductory video here if you like: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBENYGv9rj4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBENYGv9rj4</a><p>We launched in April on BlackBerry only, and have just crossed the 1000-user mark.  We offer a 14-day free trial, and so far, about 30% of users seem to be converting to paid once their trial ends.<p>Everyone's first question: ""When's the iphone app coming?""  It's coming very soon.  If you want to participate in the beta (hopefully launching late next week), click here: <a href=""http://www.breezyprint.com/iosbeta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.breezyprint.com/iosbeta</a> (redirects to a google docs form).<p>Everyone's second question: ""How does it work?""  BreezyPrint consists of a mobile app, our server in the cloud, and a small piece of client software the user installs on his PC (Mac client yet to come).  Through the PC client, the user selects printers to use with BreezyPrint, and the list is uploaded to our server.  When the user initiates a print job from his mobile device, the device queries the server for the list of printers and displays it to the user.  The user selects the printer he wants, and the document is encrypted and sent to our server, where it awaits download/decryption/printing by the PC client associated with the selected printer.<p>I'm very aware of the various competitors in the market and have some (proprietary) plans for beating them, but I would love to hear any feedback from the HN community on what we can improve.<p>In particular:
1) Any suggestions on how to make the use process clearer, without adding a ton of extra pages to the site?<p>2) Is there anything on the site that just doesn't make any sense to you?<p>3) We're pricing at 4.95/mo or 29.95/year, and the fee is for the service, not any one app itself (it's a per-user, not per-machine, license fee - so if you switch devices, somehow lose everything, etc., it doesn't cost you anything).  Any thoughts on this?<p>4) Any other suggestions?  What question(s) should I have asked, that I missed?<p>Thanks very much in advance for any feedback.  I've been lurking on HN for probably about six months now, and have learned a ton.  Looking forward to hearing what you all think.",1279911435

Archive all emails from someone after I got off the phone with them and covered everything, but let the old request sit in the box. Archive all emails from ex-girlfriend. Etc.<p>Interestingly, I had a lot of little milestones at the end, but it turns out it wasn't as hard as I thought: There were about 10 emails that I used a reminder for ""general to do"" that I added to a notepad file to-do list, and archived them. Then there was about 5 decisions where there was no particularly good decision and I didn't like my choices, so I just sacked up and picked one option or the other and did it. Like, one of them was canceling something that had an early cancel fee, and I'd been waffling on it, and I just said screw it and picked one way or the other. I don't even remember the details, which means I should have probably just picked the first time I looked at it.<p>Anyways, email inbox can be overwhelming if it's big.

This is distinctly inhuman! When we initiate a motor program we are constantly checking our prediction for the behavior of both our body and external objects against reality and then updating that program in real time. This bot apparently updates its program only after each trial.<p>2. The robot moves back to its standard starting position after each successful trial. This demonstrates the specificity of the motor pattern it's developed. Due to time pressure and the complexity of variations we deal with it is usually advantageous to learn a generalized pattern rather than a single pattern that works for a constrained set of starting conditions.<p>As a side note on the difficulty of this task, I agree with sukuriant that the paucity of the information the robot has, especially lack of fine grained touch, is a huge impediment. Secondly recall that in the human brain about 50% of the neurons live in the cerebellum which is strongly implicated in storing and updating fine grained motor patterns.

Many of such computations, however, are of the kind that could easily be carried out by quantum computers, provided you would load them up with the correct model of their neighborhood. 
Now imagine that the many worlds interpretation of QM holds: All the things in the cosmos ""span"" multiple universes. There are an infinite number of replicas of yourself in ever so slightly different universes. If your brain is indeed a quantum computer, your brain is cross-linked to all your other brains.

I'm constantly surprised at how things that are just intuitively obvious to me are alien to many others. Grad school is when much of that intuition was absorbed, I think.<p>I think that ""work ethic"" (mine, at least) is just hardwired. Same for approach to problems. I wouldn't say that grad school influenced these so much as help me realize what they were. I actually goofed off quite a bit in grad school. My work ethic (as in long hours, and job above all else) wasn't tested until I joined my first startup.<p>Opening doors: not so much. My thesis adviser was not in the mainstream of our field, and most of my friends were in other fields. My professional contacts started developing when I joined my first startup. I was extremely lucky at this startup in three ways: 1) working with world-class engineers, 2) in a well-conceived and well-funded startup, and 3) they were willing to take me, an academic who actually liked writing software, and give me a chance.<p>Having a PhD was a potential problem early on. I tried teaching/research after grad school, and discovered that it wasn't for me. (This may have been the transition from a Canadian school with easy access to small amounts of funding, to a grant-writing powerhouse in the US, where professors seemed to spend all of their time pursuing grants.) I was lucky in my transition to the software industry -- I have friends who wanted to make that transition and were not able to. And in fact, at my first startup, there was vague suspicion of me just for having the degree. But now, years later, I think that it was time well spent, better probably than what I'd get out of the usual first jobs after college.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is what sort of PhD you do. A highly theoretical focus is rarely good preparation for life in the software industry. A highly applied focus is great preparation, (I'm thinking of the long list of developers who have come out of UC Berkeley, and of course, there are the google founders.)",1279908172

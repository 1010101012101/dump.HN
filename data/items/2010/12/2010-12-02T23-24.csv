I've been doing JavaScript-as-a-kludge-for-whatever-server-side-framework-I-happen-to-discover-the-limitations-of for a while.  I'm discovering that the complexity of every browser's quirks means I'm going to have to do more than just ""learn it"".  And therein lies the problem.<p>JavaScript isn't an awful language (all languages have their pluses and minuses and developers are so touchy on this subject, I don't even want to broach it).  It's the sheer number of platforms (browser/hardware/OS combinations) that make JavaScript painful to learn properly.  Every browser on every device must perform adequately.  It's not a matter of supporting Windows or MacOS, it's every variant of RIM device, i* device, every browser on Windows Mobile taking into account the performance/memory footprint (to a lesser extent anymore), and devices with browser variants running on Android.<p>For the sake of my current set of projects -- requiring reasonable compatibility across platforms, but not a universally good user experience on all, learning jQuery became a necessity.  Though I'd prefer to not be framework dependent, I've found that understanding how to use jQuery has also improved my understanding of the various quirky implementations of JavaScript in general.<p>I have no doubt that future projects will require a good user experience on most platforms.  Does anyone have any suggestions regarding good, comprehensive resources in this area?  The blog post mentions several online resources for folks wishing to learn/understand the language (some of which I haven't used before), but I'm wondering if there are particularly excellent tools beyond that (IDEs, good debuggers beyond Firebug) or anything else out there that can assist in identifying code that <i>won't work</i>, or <i>won't work well</i> in cross platform scenarios (for free or not).",1291332819

1964065,comment,1963945,1963945,0,0,asnyder,,,"I vehemently disagree with the message of the post. It's unnecessary to suggest that anybody must learn anything, let alone JavaScript in the browser. Plenty of technologies exist that abstract away the need to know JavaScript and allow a developer to focus solely on their application rather than the underlying technologies that allow their application to run on a target platform (note, I'm a co-founder of one such technology, <a href=""http://www.noloh.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com</a>).<p>Similarly, I wouldn't demand that anyone learn assembly or C. While it can be useful in certain situations to have that knowledge it's most definitely not necessary. It's perfectly acceptable to learn and use a higher level language, whether it's NOLOH or one of many other tools and languages that generate the necessary JavaScript or other underlying code. This has the benefits of freeing the developer up to concentrate on their application, while allowing the producers of such tools to worry about the numerous implementation details regarding the many different target platforms. This also has the benefit of allowing for easier porting to non JavaScript platforms.<p>Clearly if you're somewhat religious about having to know and being able to reproduce all the underlying architecture that runs your application then you must learn JavaScript, but for many others, using a language they know, or learning a higher level language can fully allow them to focus on their applications is ideal.<p>There also exists a middle ground, for example in the case of NOLOH, if the developer knows some of the basics of JavaScript they can create, or wrap existing 3rd party JavaScript widgets or modules, but extensive knowledge of JavaScript is not necessary, and the truth of the matter is that the vast majority of developers are not of that type, but rather looks to use an existing module created by someone of that type.<p>Thus, I would argue that if you're a developer of a particular type, either one that's religious, or one that plans to create certain types of client modules or wrap/integrate client modules with little to no API, then you must learn JavaScript, but for the vast majority I believe it's becoming increasingly less necessary.",1291331624

JavaScript and Browser based apps is the web of the future when talking about apps. Most new development of web applications are taking place not with struts or ASP or PHP but with JavaScript relegation the others to providing REST services to the browser based app.<p>Personally I could not be happier, I hated the old page POST model for anything other than web magazines. It was painful to gyrate back to the server for every state change. I agree with the authors conclusion JavaScript is rapidly becoming the default language of the web UI and not having experience in it will put you at a disadvantage if you plan to do web UI work.<p>The interesting part that I see is just as the role of the designer and developer defined over the last 15 years to become two independent roles we are now seeing the roles of UX developer and systems developer diverge. I know a good deal of people on each side of the fence who are happy about that fact.<p>I see Java and C# guy that are happy that their role stops at the REST service interface.

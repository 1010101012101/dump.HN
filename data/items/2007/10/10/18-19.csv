65913,comment,65782,65782,0,0,npotter,,,"The thing is that inflation is outpacing these numbers.  With official inflation numbers hovering around 3% and real inflation (except in housing) being much stronger than that, Actual earnings haven't increased for the majority of the workforce in roughly 15 years.<p>I'd hardly call a 4.5% increase a surge either.  Removing the cut for inflation puts this more at 1.5% at best, hardly an increase worth mentioning.<p>I think Ars Technica is just trying to drum up interest.",1192041674

65909,comment,65815,65899,0,0,yubrew,,,"It's not the start ups, but the investing circles that make the hub.  Start ups can move pretty freely, but angels and VC's appear to be more set in one location.  If you can convince gutsy angels to move from San Fran to Boston, or get Boston angels to be more bold with their investments, then Boston has a chance.  Otherwise, it's not worth it for innovative start ups to stay in Boston.<p>",1192041261

The people who bought you want you to code not think, they will do the thinking from now on.  I couldn't stand that proposition, would rather train a few coders on the system and take my money and figure out what I am going to do next.<p>",1192040801

I felt he mostly says things along the lines of, &quot;oh, here is the 3-DES algorithm.&quot; But there is no commentary after it. Queestions like why is 3-DES structured so, or what are these fields are not explained at all. To me, it says that he doesn&#x27;t really know how 3-DES works at all. Or, another case I remember is the simple password protection scheme in ZIP. He says that the three keys are initialized with these three values (which can be found in the PKZIP app readme). Then he goes on to claim that it is not secure and that cryptographers can break it easily. But how would start to do it is not explained at all.  Why even mention what these three keys are initialized with? It was a disappointing book.<p>I felt he did not even disseminate old knowledge because he does not know/comprehend old knowledge.

No need for the Dr. Evil-style &quot;laser&quot; air quotes.

Many banks/lenders actually service most of their non-real estate loans vs. selling them. Also, to the extent that they do sell loans, they care about credit-worthiness because higher quality loans fetch a higher price.<p>><i>(If you ask, &quot;what happens when that risk isn&#x27;t spread widely enough?&quot;, the answer is that you get an economic meltdown such as the one that happened in 2008.)</i><p>This is incorrect. In some ways, the problem was that they &quot;spread the risk&quot; <i>too much</i>. That is, the same loans were re-packaged and sold multiple times, creating insane leverage through exotic instruments (derivatives, CDOs, etc.) of little-to-no-intrinsic value. Had we simply seen a series of defaults, the systemic threat would have been greatly reduced. It was the leverage that created the real crisis.",1382399712

6588968,comment,6583103,6584689,2,0,icu,,,"Having lived in the USA and the UK I&#x27;ve experienced the political contrasts.  My gut feel is that the American political engagement, the way the media reports politics, and how people think as a result are to blame here.<p>So exactly what do I mean by that?  Well for starters I believe that the American political structure doesn&#x27;t lend itself easily to direct public scrutiny and transparency.  I can&#x27;t remember ever meeting an American politician except when it was in their best self interest... surprise, surprise right around election time.  Barriers are set up making it difficult to get face-time with a Senator or a Governor.  By comparison MPs (British Members of Parliament) are obliged to have open constituency meetings where a member of the public can arrange to speak to their MP face to face.<p>British politicians just seem more willing to me to engage with &#x27;Joe Public.&#x27;  For example, it would be beyond belief to hear that the US Vice President or some Governor of some state has a weekly call in radio talk show slot, yet Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (kind of like the British Vice President) and Mayor of London Boris Johnson (who is more like a US Governor than a city Mayor) have regular weekly radio slot on LBC (a call in radio talk show) where they calls from ordinary citizens and sometimes take some intense heat.<p>Also understanding American politics outside of the likes of Fox and others (or what I would say is the &quot;TV political bubble&quot;) is difficult.  Sure there are some amazing publications one can read.  The likes of the The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Time, The Economist, and Foreign Policy all spring to mind.  However these publications are not for everyone and definitely not read by the masses.<p>In comparison, the Sun and other tabloids, manage to break politics down into bite-sized blurbs that focus on the important parts for the everyman.  I believe that this allows Brit Joe Public to be regularly informed on politics and therefore more engaged.  So well much could be said about how bad tabloids are, I think they provide a valuable public service keeping people informed and from time to time crucifying the odd politician or goading them to action.<p>If there was maybe more public political engagement, more willingness for politicians to be accountable and less special interests on capital hill maybe the average citizen would understand why data protection is important and feel they have the leverage on politicians to enact it.",1382399697

6588959,comment,6585711,6588596,2,0,derefr,,,"Really, it&#x27;s just a rephrasing of the meaning-of-life question, which itself is, as far as I understand it, incoherent; &quot;what is the <i>proper</i> utility function&quot; is a value judgement, and thus can only be answered by someone who already <i>has</i> a utility function by some means or another. (Even questions like &quot;do you want your posthuman descendants to have this utility function or that&quot; depend on the parts of our utility functions that finds comfort in familiarity, or interest in novelty, etc.)<p>Assuming that the less universally-agreed-upon aspects of our utility functions are mostly built during childhood through social interaction, whether you&#x27;re better off in &quot;culture&quot; or a subculture depends entirely on which one you end up adapting yourself to. It&#x27;s sort of like asking whether a refrigerator is better off plugged into 120V/60Hz or 240V/50Hz power: it depends entirely on which power system the refrigerator was designed for. Except, in a way, we design ourselves. I think the most important takeaway is that children should be made aware of the grand choice they are making, in hewing themselves to the mold of one reward system or the other; and of what sort of efforts they&#x27;ll have to make, and games they&#x27;ll have to play, to achieve happiness within one or the other system.",1382399524

I was not all that academically driven that semester, and I was kind of taken by surprise by how hard the language was, once I started doing the later projects, and I barely got through the course. That was my only exposure to functional programming until after college, when I wanted to make up for that and I undertook to learn Scheme. I didn&#x27;t have much trouble with Scheme, and the functional concepts I&#x27;d heard about in the course finally made sense. If you&#x27;re trying to learn the functional style, I don&#x27;t see the point in learning at the same time a complex type system. The type system isn&#x27;t a natural consequence of functional programming, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not really related but adds a lot of difficulty.<p>I don&#x27;t want to start a flame war, but I view types as being sort of peripheral to the task of getting the computer to do things.

I think the GP is correct - with enough preparation, a concentrated PhantomJS attack will look <i>exactly</i> like users accessing the website en masse, and it can be very, very difficult to tell who is real and who is not. That is why they use a tool as heavy as PhantomJS, which (from experience) is not very quick compared to more traditional methods. It is because it spoofs a real browser quite completely that it is so good for these methods.<p>For example, some pages might do a trick where they set a cookie, load another page, and redirect / drop based on whether or not that cookie is present in exactly the form it should be present. Maybe they set two, one expires immediately and the other contains some complex data. PhantomJS can handle that easily (as it is just Webkit + QT) but traditional tools do not.",1382399110

Better power management requires changes in behaviour of the OS and it is very hard to change behaviour without breaking things.<p>Suppose the USB sleep state handling code is suboptimal. Is that because programmers paid less attention to power usage a decade ago, or because some devices implement a power state incorrectly? If the latter, which devices? If Microsoft isn&#x27;t 100% sure they know of all devices for which it is needed, they may choose to leave the less efficient code in place regardless of whether a deficient device is plugged in.<p>An example might be a pet peeve I have with Windows: its tendency to &#x27;discover new hardware&#x27; when one plugs a bog standard mouse or keyboard into a USB port for the umpteenth time. That in itself is baffling, but it can take Windows half a minute or so to figure out that it has a driver for the device and start it. I do not have the faintest idea what it does in that time, but it must be unavoidable within the constraints microsoft sets itself, since it hasn&#x27;t been fixed in a decade or so (but it has been improved quite a bit) and I bet it must have itched quite a few engineers.<p>Whatever the cause, plugging in a USB mouse must use way more power on Windiws than on a Mac.",1382397506

If your standard is narrow enough to only support 2 hardware configurations, OEMs will not build it, because Dell has no way to differentiate itself from Toshiba.<p>To match Apple, Microsoft needs to cut back to maybe 3 models of Windows tablets per year.

6588767,comment,6587481,6588674,14,0,mjn,,,"Yeah, this is a big problem with less rigorously covered subjects. If you think of Wikipedia as a summary of existing sources on a subject (which is what it aspires to be), and the existing sources suck, then the summary, by transitivity, also sucks. But there&#x27;s not much that can be done about that within the scope of the mission, defined in that way. If you instead think of Wikipedia as a compendium of <i>true</i> information on all subjects, the problem gets much harder: then it would aspire not only to <i>summarize all information ever produced</i>, but also to vet all that information for accuracy, correct anything incorrect published in any academic field or in the popular press, and fill in gaps where the third-party sources are lacking entirely [1] ... plus convince people that these corrections, despite no citations, are true. I think that is better tackled in separate projects: one project (Wikipedia) to summarize the existing state of writing, and different projects to improve it in specific fields, e.g. a project to improve documentation of 20th-century punk rock, or to document the history of open-source software.<p>Wikipedia has, though, tried to cautiously make a few exceptions to what counts as a citation to address some of the more specific problems relating to individuals. Personal blogs are not generally considered published sources, but <i>are</i> acceptable sources for the specific case of summarizing what the person who writes the blog themselves thinks about a subject, in cases where that&#x27;s relevant [2]. This is used most commonly to cover the &quot;subject&#x27;s side&quot;, e.g. if there is an article about someone that includes negative information, and that person has responded on their own blog, but hasn&#x27;t managed to get a newspaper to publish their rebuttal, Wikipedia will still cite the rebuttal. I guess that&#x27;s along the lines of asking your sisters to make an unambiguous statement somewhere about your existence.<p>The questionable reliability of news articles also means that they tend only to be treated as acceptable sources for newer things. If you&#x27;re writing about WW1, it&#x27;s frowned on to directly cite <i>New York Times</i> articles on the conflict, because some of them were wrong in hindsight, and we now have much better books and journal articles written about it, which have done all the legwork of reading through the newspaper archives and assessing their reliability. At this point, making a new argument about the conflict based solely on previously-unnoticed news articles is original research that ought to be submitted to a journal, and only to Wikipedia if it&#x27;s accepted by the historical community first (this is not purely hypothetical with WW2, where people really do try to come up with novel interpretations of the Holocaust based on a new reading of old newspaper archives). Alas, for newer stuff there&#x27;s often no such alternative, short of just not covering the subject at all, so newspaper articles are accepted on something like the Syrian civil war, because they haven&#x27;t yet been superseded by anything better.<p>One thing that&#x27;s interesting to me is that some of this source-evaluation difficulty would be simplified if <i>they</i> had applied some of the same rules as Wikipedia. Sometimes I will cite a <i>New York Times</i> obituary for an article, because it contains a bunch of facts about a person conveniently collated. But then I wonder: where did the <i>NYT</i> obituary author get this information? Is it based on solid first-hand research? Summarizing old <i>NYT</i> articles? Cribbing info from <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>? It would be nice to know!<p>[1] I wrote a bit about the gap problem elsewhere, <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SELFPUB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SELFPUB</a>",1382396519

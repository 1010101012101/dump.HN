They stole my equity. Period. Plain and simple.<p>It was their fancy methods of making money that stole the money for my retirement, my children's education, and home improvements. I wish they would take their 2 trillion dollars and fly to the moon.<p>These people are scum. Harvard is just a fancy school for thieves. You can dress up a pig, and its still a pig.<p>When these folks wanted to make money they changed the bankruptcy laws, freed up credit, and started charging 30-40 percent interest on credit card loans.<p>They freed up credit in the home loan markets and allowed speculators to drive up the price of homes 3-4 times their value. And then when the bust comes, they cry their eyes out because they are afraid to invest.<p>They are fear based because the days of thievery are at an end. It sickens me to see someone post this stuff as if they are our only answer to the future.<p>The real answer has several components:<p>1. Tie our money to a real standard. Gold.<p>2. Loan money to middle America from Banks ran by our country and limit interest earnings to 1 percent. This means housing, student loans, car loans with a cap of 1% payback for fiat money borrowed to pay for it.<p>3. Get rid of income tax. Sales tax only.<p>4. Eliminate sales of stocks which do not provide a minimum dividend payment monthly. You can't pay your dividends, you go bankrupt. Period.<p>5. No more funny money games with derivatives, credit swaps, bundling, blah bu blah. To hell with free wheeling economics. It does not work and it only helps the greedy bastards that continue to screw us middle Americans that only seek stability in our futures.<p>6. Money = Greed. Control how much any one entity is allowed to own based on productivity. Cap it based on ability to produce goods, services, or IP. No CEO should be paid more than 50 times the lowest level employee in the company. Think we would be talking about minimum wage if this were the law?<p>7. Force people to save by taking 1% of all sales tax paid every year and allocating it to a privatized social security account.<p>8. Eliminate Unemployment. If you can print money the way we do, then spend it on creating government jobs meant to help people. If money is not tied to a gold standard, then its really just perception anyway. Print it and give it directly to folks that will use it to live better than poverty levels.<p>9. Free Health Care for everyone. Pay doctors the same level you pay a money manager and the doctor shortage is gone in 6 years. HMO's? Private medicine? How do you justify this in the worlds richest country with 42 million men, women, and children, not able to afford it?<p>It is only a matter of time before we eliminate money entirely. 500 years? A thousand? One day nano tech and robotics are going to completely eliminate labor required to fulfill our basic necessities. Star Trek Communism will replace this greed driven economy.<p>Live long and prosper...",1234477375

479094,comment,477955,479063,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"I'm firmly in the camp of index fund investing over picking individual stocks or money managers.  Statistics will tell you that you're far better off just picking an index fund.  But that doesn't make money management an invalid field or a pseudoscience.  It just means that it's hard to differentiate between those with true skill and those who just got lucky.<p>It seems like the same can be said for venture investing.  How do you know which entrepreneurs will be successful?  You don't, so you go off of their past performance, the market environment, the strength of their idea and their team, etc, etc.  But you also go one step further and try to spread the risk across a portfolio of investments.  Perhaps you should do the same with money managers?  Pick the 10-20 at the top of the field and let them all manage a piece of your portfolio?  Obvious problems here as well.<p>On a related note, does this mean that venture funding is fundamentally flawed?  That venture funds would be better off just putting their money in index funds?

It's more permanent in the sense that it lasts in different form. That said, there's an art to theatre that can't be replicated on-screen, and because of those arts, and because of the incredible history of theatre, it won't ever go away. It might not be constantly in the spotlight, but it'll always be there.<p>Similarly, paper books won't disappear. I'll be able to hold on to my Little Nemo and Krazy Kat and Series of Unfortunate Events and my kids will be able to have that same thrill of opening a new book for the first time. Maybe they'll read more ebooks than they'll read books, but the books will always be there.",1234476260

That doesn't mean that the market is a failure or that it's ""pseudoscience"".'<p>The trouble is, you can come up with a pretty good approximation of a portfolio that reflects the ""wisdom"" of the broad market on your own.  Pick one or a few diversified index funds, follow some guidelines to split up your portfolio between fixed income and equities (maybe add some real estate or commodities if you want to get fancy), and you're done.  You might get some suggestions on the particulars of which index fund, or exact allocation percentages, from a money manager but that's not really adding much value.  Maybe just a one time consultation.<p>But what if you want to beat the market?  Is there someone you can go to and be confident he or she has a good chance to succeed?<p>Well, if such a person exists, you probably will not be able to identify him or her, except maybe if you know as much about money management as they do.  Bernie Madoff is the perfect example here.  The people who invested with him were not able to distinguish his pyramid scheme scam from a good investing scheme until it was too late.  Some of his investors were supposedly pretty sophisticated in financial matters, too.<p>So, you can get the average market return on your own, and you probably can't tell a good money manager from a bad one.  That eliminates most of the reasons for employing a money manager, even if good ones exist.",1234476156

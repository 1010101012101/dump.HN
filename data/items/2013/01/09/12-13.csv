5031257,comment,5030803,5030990,7,0,cgag,,,"I'm coming from a Clojure perspective (around a year of using it), so maybe some of this stuff is different with CL, but Clojure is incredibly simple compared to C++ and in my experience there's no problem with everyone simply using the entire language.<p>I've read a decent amount of Clojure source, since documentation is admittedly a problem with a lot of libraries, but it's the language I've found actually easiest to read.  The Clojure way of going about things is to pass around and manipulate simple immutable data structures, which I find easier to understand than large class hierarchies.  Macros are usually used for creating DSLs or removing simple boilerplate, which leads to smaller, easier to understand code bases in my experience, rather than implementing custom object systems or something like that.<p>I don't think Clojure really discourages recursion so much as it lets you avoid using it explicitly by providing a good standard library, but many of the standard lib functions are themselves written recursively.<p>Anyway this was all in response to why isn't it used more.  I don't really have a good answer for that, but a lot of it comes to from people being weirded out from its simple syntax, and also not wanting to learn to think functionally.  It is being used though, the most successful Clojure example I can think of off the top of my head is Storm, which is usually billed as a Hadoop for realtime processing, and it's being used at a lot of large companies: <a href=""http://storm-project.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storm-project.net/</a>",1357736349

Scieneer Common Lisp is also based on CMUCL.<p>SBCL is a fork of CMUCL. SBCL is very popular in the 'free software' Lisp community - it's just a repackaged CMUCL.<p>Lot's of other Lisp implementations took and still are taking code from CMUCL, since it is 'Public Domain'. Free software.<p>Btw., CMUCL still has monthly releases.<p>AKCL spawned several implementations. Including GNU Common Lisp (GCL), which was widely used for some time - in combination with GCC.<p>GCL has been long used to run Maxima, the free version of Macsyma.<p>AKCL/GCL is nowadays ECL. Another fork. Which is maintained until today. Again ECL is possible because GCL was Free Software.",1357736334

And to make matters worse, the typical startup seldom needs more than a couple of designers vs needing a small army of developers - therefore increasing demand for good developers with a decent track record and decreasing job opportunities for the common graphic designer. Also, this graphic designers gravitate towards big design shops (since there is less opportunities as opposed to an ""In House Designer"") who then have a supernumerary selection choices for both, the top end very well paid designer and the photoshop grunt who spends his days pen tooling people out of photos for use in advertisement.<p>Another point to take into consideration is that most designers on the rise end up managing art and/or marketing departments in which case they stop being graphic designers and end up with titles such as Creative Director, Brand Manager, etc... while a whole lot of developers on the rise keep being developers, albeit of the Senior Developer, X Specialty Dev/Architect/Programmer, et al.

If a given language is worse than every other in almost every context (the ""global"" context, if you will), then it's clearly an inferior language relative to the others.<p>JavaScript does exhibit this. It has exactly one thing going for it: it's the only scripting language widely available in web browsers.<p>Aside from that, it's inferior to most other languages in almost every respect. Its syntax is mediocre. Its semantics are inconsistent and often outright confusing. It's missing critical features that are essential for anything but the smallest-scale development. Its performance is only just somewhat poor today, due to a huge amount of effort from Google and others, otherwise it was downright abysmal in its early implementations. Its libraries are more bandages for its numerous problems, rather than tools that empower developers. The supporting tooling is quite bad (Chrome's developer tools or Firebug don't compare to a real debugger, for instance). The community leaves a lot to be desired, especially given the high amount of ignorance and the extremely bad ""advice"" that is passed around so often by its members.<p>We shouldn't be politically correct when it comes to technology.

(*to)->parent   : NULL;\n    if(*to)   (*to)->parent   = *from ? (*from)->parent : NULL;\n    avl_tree_swap(avl, from, to);\n    child->parent = (*parent)->parent;\n    if(!((*parent)->parent))\n      avl->root = child;\n    else if((*parent)->parent->left == *parent)\n      (*parent)->parent->left = child;\n    else if((*parent)->parent->right == *parent)\n      (*parent)->parent->right = child;\n    (*parent)->parent = child;\n    *from = *parent;\n    avl_tree_update(avl, *parent);\n    avl_tree_update(avl, child);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt was one of nicer programming workouts I ever got (the whole class was a great experience and I think every professional programmer should go through implementing all the basic data structures and algorithms in plain C one time), but I never managed to get deletion right, despite spending quite some hours on it, it just went beyond my head. Not that it matters for linked lists, and in this case I made it deliberately harder on myself, but I think the moral of the story is that when you are too clever with implementation details, you might run out of your cleverness when starting to deal with the actual problem domain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree</a>",1357732809

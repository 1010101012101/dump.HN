1458808,comment,1456026,1457687,0,0,eston,,,"Three things:<p>1. There are a bunch of environmental costs that still make them largely impractical:<p>- the environmental cost of making the filters (plastic injection molding, etc.)\n- the environmental cost of disposing of the filters\n- the environmental cost of waste produced by installing new waterless urinals in place of the old watered ones<p>These costs are surprisingly high for something trying to be ""green"". You can model these positive externalities as such in a ""dollar amount"" by taking into account things such as offset taxes toward pollution (from manufacturing,) costs of disposal over the decomposition life of the object, etc.<p>2. Unfortunately, the environmental cost is almost never the one that wins in any real-world scenario unless the personal utility of the person owning said waterless urinal is greater than the cost of running the watered one — i.e., the person that installed the waterless urinal enjoys the waterless one enough to compensate for the extra costs involved in running it over a watered one. They are more expensive right now, and will be for quite some time if we're talking about replacing the watered ones with waterless ones. Dollars are the bottom line, especially when negative externalities are not offset in the costs of the watered product.<p>3. I'm a general skeptic of many of these types of green things due to #2 - it's the ""Prius syndrome"" in effect. Many of these types of things have little real-world environmental impact when the full cost of ownership is taken into account. Once you add up all of the costs involved:<p>(manufacturing costs of old watered urinal) + (disposal costs of old watered urinal) + (opportunity cost of purchasing waterless urinal and installing waterless urinal) + (cost of new waterless urinal) + (cost of filters) * ((uses / single filter life) * (life of waterless urinal product))<p>When all is said and done, the overall real cost - even environmentally - of many of these ""green"" products ends up being far greater than just using the old product. People don't buy many of these types of things for anything other than their own psychological benefit of <i>feeling</i> greener, such as is the case with the Prius - I read somewhere if you <i>actually</i> wanted to maximise for environmental cost, you'd buy a used Toyota Echo.",1277405985

Sounds good, BUT if you did not take the time to actually do some statistical hypothesis testing, you could be making a mistake.<p>What are the chances that A and B will have exactly the same conversion rate? For any reasonably large set of data, it is very close to 0. That means that A > B or B > A no matter what A and B actually are. The difference you observed between A and B could be real or it could be noise. Various statistical tests[1] can help you in deciding between the two possibilities.<p>Flip a coin twice. Lets say you get two heads. If you then conclude that for this coin heads are much more likely than tails, that would be wrong. This is the sort of mistake statistical tests can help you avoid.<p>[1] I'm being intentionally vague here because what statistical tests you should use depends on what A and B are, what assumptions you are willing to make, sample size, and other factors.

It's just awful hard to imagine that the amount of processing done per quote in a HFT system can be less than a few hash table lookups...<p>I'd imagine the real difficulty would be making sure that the quotes you're putting in are a) relevant enough not to be immediately and trivially screened out by your competitors, b) not in danger of actually getting acted upon, and c) seemingly legitimate even in the face of after-the-fact scrutiny so that you avoid getting butt raped by the SEC for manipulation.  a) and b) would likely be pretty easy to satisfy if you didn't have to worry about c), so...I don't know, this doesn't seem terribly implausible to me.<p>Then again, I don't know much about HFT, there may be factors in play that would make it a lot trickier to manipulate things in this way.

By this I mean documents for which the specific layout, placement, and aspect ratio is an integral part of the authorship. A comic book/comic strip or a diagram meant to be viewed a certain way are examples of this.  Lots of the technical books I have are designed such that to change their visual presentation would require changing the actual content.  Like it or not, there's tons of pre-existing content designed for a specific presentation, and PDF (or postscript) are a good choice for that.<p>The biggest problem with PDF is that it usually requires a specific page orientation and aspect ratio, if not a specific page size.  This is okay if you have a large enough display and can resize your viewer window to suit, but it's a bit more of a problem on smaller displays, or irregular shaped or resolved displays.

Why, if he followed Fried's advice, he'd never close those deals!<p>You want to take the advice of people like Scott Olson if this is the situation you'd like to find yourself in: bouncing from make-or-break high-6-figures enterprise deals dogfighting with 3 other companies doing exactly the same thing you do. There is indeed a playbook that most direct sales enterprise software companies run from, and if you don't mind quietly crying into your hands for 5 minutes every day when you start your day sitting in the lobby of a telecom company you're pitching in Jackson Mississippi, you are well served by its plays[1].<p>I can't read Fried's mind, but here is the sense I get from how he writes --- and this may be my own bias here --- he would rather gnaw off and consume raw his own big toes than run this kind of company. He's writing his own playbook for his company. And in that playbook, he doesn't ""staff up"". He's unlikely to wind up in a situation where he has to delude himself that he can ramp up 2 sales reps so that they can close a <i>single deal</i> whose window is <i>days to close</i>.<p>Instead, the point of Fried's model appears to be: grow headcount as slowly as possible, and instead of posting job reqs, leave yourself maximally exposed to motivated talent. Exposed: running a company that people love, and that people are inclined to ping for openings. Motivated: people who are seeking out the opportunity to work with you. Talent: people who can prove themselves with something other than a sheet of paper that looks identical to everyone else's paper.<p>Scott Olson's friend can't do that. He runs an enterprise software company that needs ""Enterprise SAS Salespersons"". Guessing, regardless of the ""deep technical rocket science"" involved, that top talent isn't beating down the doors to get an interview at that company --- unless it's attached to a monstrous 1099 consulting rate.<p>But, I mean, what do I know? All I can say for reasonably sure is that Fried is crying his way to the bank because of this mean post.<p>By the way: I've lived in Chicago all my life, started 2 companies here, one of which I'm at now, and I don't know anyone who (a) works for the park district or (b) is hiring people with UofC MBA's. Scott might just have needed a better social circle here, and some different career choices. As someone who has spent a couple years in the valley, I will attest to the fact that it is easier to find people talking about the ""rocket ride days at Netscape"" there. That wasn't enough of a win for me to stay, but hey, if ""heady stuff"" like that does it for you, mazel tov! You be a mensch in the valley, I'll keep growing a business in Chicago.<p>[1] This playbook is also the reason every VC-funded enterprise software company with less than 10MM revs has products with pilot pricing at $70,000, and why they all have the exact same 3-person VP/Marketing, Dir/Marketing, and Marketing Communications Manager marketing team, solely responsible for giving the CEO a ""marketing plan"" that in no way influences the sole product the whole company develops. It is also the playbook that recruits 3 ""sales engineers"" so that there are enough people staffing the pointless industry conferences the playbook dictates they must spend $200,000 on every year. And it's the reason you're getting fucking obnoxious phone calls from ""inside sales"" people every other day.<p>And since nobody who actually knew what they were doing would ever go out of their way to subject themselves to this kabuki startup built out of PowerPoint ""lego"" slides and strip club visits, you <i>do indeed need resumes</i> to execute this plan.<p>But hey.

I discovered Nial a while ago while researching array-based programming languages and found that it was pretty much what I wanted.<p>I will try to give you an extremely brief introduction here, but you should really download it from their page (<a href=""http://www.nial.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nial.com/</a>) which has a great implementation guide, as well as manuals in their documentation ZIP package.<p><pre><code>  > p :+ 1.5 1.6\n  > q := 3 4\n  > p * q\n  4.5 6.4\n  > * p q\n  4.5 6.4\n  > + * p q\n  10.9\n</code></pre>\nThere exists several forms for writing vectors/lists in Nial:<p><pre><code>  s := 3\n  v := (3 4)\n  m := [2 3 4, 5 6 7]\n\n  > + v\n  7\n  > + m\n  10 18 28\n  > each + m\n  9 18\n</code></pre>\nIn the K tutorial they have psuedo-code which looks like Nial code.<p><pre><code>  > v + v\n  6 8\n  > v eachleft < v\n  [false true, false false]\n  > v eachright < v\n  [false false, true false]\n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind, I am lieing here. true is actually represented as 'l' and false is represented by 'o'. Strange, but it works.<p><pre><code>  > v * m\n  [6 9 12, 20 24 28]\n  > + * v m\n  26 33 40\n</code></pre>\nFunction currying is done on the left side.<p><pre><code>  (2 *) m\n  [4 6 8, 10 12 14]\n</code></pre>\nGiven a list of cashflows c that come at corresponding times t with a prevailing discount rate d, then ...<p><pre><code>  > c := 0.1 0.1 1.1\n  > t := 1 2 3\n  > pv is op c t d { + * c (d power t) }\n  > pv c t 0.9\n  0.9729\n</code></pre>\nI don't really follow the last example, and it doesn't translate to Nial because Nial requires the shapes to match up. So giving an array of 4 to PV doesn't work. If they keep it to an array of 3 it does.<p><pre><code>  > pv c t (1 0.9 .81)\n  .765585\n  > pv c t (0.9 .81 .729)\n  0.581773\n</code></pre>\nThis gets a different answer from what they show though. Shrug.<p>Nial also has indexing primitives like k.<p><pre><code>  > t\n  1 2 3\n  > t@1\n  2\n  > m\n  [2 3 4, 5 6 7]\n  > m@1\n  5 6 7\n</code></pre>\nYou have to be careful how you define your variables to have indexing work right (which is frustrating). For example:<p><pre><code>  > a := [2 3 4, 5 6 7]\n  > 1 2 pick a\n  ?address\n  > b := 2 3 reshape 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n  > 1 2 pick b\n  7\n  > shape a\n  2\n  > shape b\n  2 3\n  > shape a@1\n  3\n  > b@(1 2)\n  7\n</code></pre>\nWhen defined the first way, a doesn't understand the shape of the sublists. So you have to manually touch it to see what it is. Lame.<p><pre><code>  > a := 2 3 reshape link a\n  > a\n  [2 3 4, 5 6 7]\n</code></pre>\nLINK forces a into a single list, and reshape changes the shape of A so the outer-most container understands what it is.

Besides everything the paper mentions, all of which I agree with, there are a few other things it does for you.<p>I'm not a computer scientist, as the article seems to target, but a practicing software engineer, but I feel more like an amateur hack.  The reason is b/c with almost every problem I'm tasked to solve or app to build, I'm never quite sure whether I'm solving or building it the most efficient, robust way (and some times I know I'm not, but am limited by my tools).<p>That lingering doubt makes me feel like a charlatan, or a used car salesman, hocking my wares while suspecting their quality.<p>To fix that, I've recently taken a sabbatical just to cram through SICP, PCL, Norvig's AIP, K&R and some other C and kernel hacking books, and Haskell and Ocaml, Erlang and/or Google Go, and probably some of the other highly regarded books on the topic (Code Complete, etc).  It was just too slow-going trying to do that while working full time.  If there were a degree program with that curriculum I'd go do it, but there's none that I know of.<p>Consider it your due diligence.  Doing it as thoroughly as possible gives you confidence and a valuable psychological edge, be your opponent a tough problem or a ten-cent-per-hour rent-a-coder overseas.<p>The other tangible benefit is to your personal brand marketing: there's not much more of a clear signal that you are curious, eager to learn, open minded, and passionate about and dedicated to your craft than learning multiple languages, and these things are essentially requirements if you ever hope to work for/with the best programmers and engineers in the business.

For example:<p><pre><code>   ""In my opinion, the earth revolves around the Sun.""\n   ""In my opinion, Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States.""\n   etc.\n</code></pre>\nBecause some statements are clear and simple facts, it can sometimes be useful to delineate opinion from fact, especially in cases where it's not explicitly clear which type of statement is being made. In <i>most</i> cases, I think that it's pretty clear from the context that 37signals' is writing from their own experience and sharing their opinions, and thus littering their writing with ""weasel words"" would diminish the quality of the writing.<p>However, in many cases (including some by 37signals), writers intentionally leave out the ""weasel words"" not because their statements are obviously opinion, but because they know it will get people riled up and serve as good linkbait. Ironically, they often fall back to this whole idea of ""of course it's only my opinion, weasel words are bad writing, etc"", which strikes me as kind of a reverse-weasel. Write as if you're stating absolute truth (in order to get links), even when you aren't, and then hide behind ""good writing"" when people complain.<p>[1] I'm really not interested in the greater philosophical questions of whether it's opinion that the earth revolves around the sun.

I saw this in an email that Google Checkout sent out:<p>1. Firstly, of course you should send an email asking the person to leave a review a week or two later<p>2. Do NOT require the person to login to leave the review (use a ""one time login link"").  Removing this hurdle can help.<p>3. Embed the actual review form RIGHT IN the email.  With a submit button.<p>Basically all this is about reducing the hurdle to leaving a review as much as possible.  The ""archive"" button is just to easy so if they have to leave the email or login you've already lost people.<p>Submitting forms doesn't work in all email clients so you'll have to also include the one time login link for anyone who can't submit the form right from their email.  But it does work much of the time.  To generate the HTML for the email form that works across most email clients, the easiest way I've found is to create a new form in Google Docs, and email it to yourself as a starting point to copy from.  The HTML they generate is pretty well optimized from what I've seen.<p>I still don't have tons of reviews on that site though.  So it is definitely tough to get people to engage.<p>Also - the simpler the review the better.<p>A pulldown will get filled out more often than a free form text field.<p>Radio buttons will get filled out more than a pulldown.<p>A simple thumbs up thumbs down will get filled out more often than 5 stars.<p>And only a thumbs up (or like) will get more than thumbs up or down.<p>When I moved from a 5 star thing to just up/down on BuyersVote.com it helped a bit with engagement.",1277403561

He's arguing against cartoon characters!"" But a lot of people really do get caught up in the ideas of what they should be doing to grow their business according to some blueprint and don't stop to consider whether it's best for the business at this stage. I think Paul Graham has written about this too, where too much venture capital will put pressure on startups to become big business-y in a hurry, to their detriment.",1277402860

That said, if you know how to work within the rules of their game, you don't have to work that hard, make easy steady money and still be considered a great employee. My theory is that good coders tend to be awful at office politics, so we suffer more than necessary when bounded to the inflexible rules at large companies. I learned to handle that from manager who couldn't code his way out of a paper bag, but really understood people.<p>Someone should come up with an office politics for dummies.. and this would be my first entry: nobody can treat you like shit unless you allow them too.<p>(feel free to add your own entries ) :)",1277402854

I think Jason would agree that resumes aren't 100% useless in every case.<p>But writing from a ""lets tell both sides of the story"" perspective is boring and accomplishes nothing (everyone knows there are two sides to every story).

You could have a PhD grad from Caltech A and a community college grad B such that B is more skilled for the job than A.<p>But if you have a very small amount of information and time to make a decision, where would you place a bet? It's certainly very unfair for the many talented graduates from lesser known universities. However, I find the idea of recruiting based partially on these bullet points valid from a expected proficiency optimizing perspective.<p>The talented guy doing IT at a law firm has some options to signal his talent.

Performing experiments takes a lot of time, because the experiments take time, but often they take on the order of hours and you can use that time for other stuff. When I was graduating in physics, I often went to the lab on evenings, in weekends, hell, even on Boxing day. However, when I was there, I usually wasn't working on my thesis; I was just running experiments. In the meantime, I read books, went to the gym, surfed the web, etc. It's far from ideal, as 'the job' is on your mind 24/7 and it ties you up a bit, but it is not as bad as it may seem to an outsider not realizing what actually went on when I was at the lab.",1277402529

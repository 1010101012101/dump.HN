I always wanted to create software that changes lives or people cant live without it or something incredible by seeing it I can feel proud to by seeing that I built this and this is used by millions of users. I did not care about money much all I want is work that makes me happy at the end of the day. Work, that makes me smarter everyday, work that I love.<p>My 1st company was telecom giant I got chance to code on few modules but that also stopped after few months. After one and half years I changed a company to get good development profile and work but I did not find work I wanted or at least challenging bug fixes. In search of good challenging work I changed three companies and like wise in my current 4th company I am trapped with previous kind of company culture where I am not getting any work or little work which wont help me to fulfill my expectations.<p>I am pretty much confused what to do. I understood I should go for startups to get what I want challenging work. I made a huge mistake because I was after big brands of corporate world. In doing so I marked myself as a job hopper. It was not my fault I don't like change too but just in search of challenging work I changed companies.<p>What should I do? Should I change company again and go for startup in order to get job satisfaction? Or just for the sake of my resume I should stay in my current company by not staying happy and wasting time? I am earning enough money, the only problem is not job satisfaction. Please help/guide.",1308675137

Who has time to spend reading yet another set of release notes every few days, when there's a good chance that nothing in them will be usable in production projects for several years anyway?<p>If you really want to drive progress, I implore you to stop this madness, and allow a few months for the industry to consolidate so we have some sort of standards to work with. You've made your point: the W3C is a dinosaur chasing a snail riding on a tortoise and you can go faster.

But by privileging actors as much as it does, Erlang gets a lot of great stuff out of it that have no effective competition in other languages, OTP in particular. Haskell may offer every sensible concurrency construct under the sun, but you don't get OTP to speak of. (Some efforts are underway, but they are new and I'd be surprised if they are stable yet.) Erlang is definitely niche, but it fits that niche very well and the niche is larger than it may initially appear... but it certainly isn't the best choice for all purposes.

You can talk about how not being open doesn't benefit the user but Apple clearly disagree - they're not walling off their phone because they're fascists, they're doing so because they believe that provides a better experience overall. You can disagree with that but I see no rational argument even if they do you disagree with their approach which takes you from the walled garden to this sort of kill switch.<p>Plus to implement such a thing would put them at a significant commercial disadvantage against Android and other smart phone platforms at precisely the time when their advantage is shrinking (if not gone altogether).

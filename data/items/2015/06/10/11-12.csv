9691367,comment,9686854,9689332,0,0,globuous,,,"Honestly, i don&#x27;t mind the window focusing on mac. What I absolutely fucking hate though, is working on Windows and not being able to scroll on a window that&#x27;s not active. By default on Mac, if a window&#x27;s focused, you can scroll another (unfocused) window by scrolling when you mouse is over it. Without having to refocus windows, which is really nice when you&#x27;re typing something on the focused window.<p>As for the cmd button replacing the ctrl button. Never going back to ctrl+<key> for shortcuts. The command button is so much nicer to use, it&#x27;s your thumb vs you pinky. You don&#x27;t need to stretch you pinky/move you hand slightly to have access to shortcuts and that&#x27;s so nice. VERY desturbing at first (I hated it), but never going back. Or maybe I&#x27;ve just gotten used to using my thumb. Ultimately, I think it makes a lot more sense though. No more alt-F4 to close windows, its cmd+Q, no more ctrl+B to bold a text, it&#x27;s cmd+b, cmd+h minimizes/hides your window etc etc.<p>Also, what i found infinitely annoying at first and that I really like now on Mac, is the window switching with the keyboard. On Windows, alt+tab switches between all windows (including different instances of same program). on Mac, alt+tab switches between applications and alt+` switches between different instances of a said program. I find that more elegant when you have a lot of windows opened, which i always have.<p>But all these are tiny little things that add up to something really nice to use, but each individually don&#x27;t and will never justify OS X being <i>the best OS in the world blah blah</i>. You can probably achieve a similar behavior on windows/Linux/whatever. What&#x27;s nice about it though is that it&#x27;s the default setup, no third party app needed/config files. You install it and it makes sense. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not switching from OS X anytime soon, it&#x27;s ergonomic, the UI is sick, power user features everywhere, and a real unix. I see it as a linux that works perfectly out of the box. I remember the first month I spent on OS X (coming from 4 years of linux, 2 yr Ubuntu and 2 yr Arch, using both full desktop env (KDE mostly) and lightweigth window managers), everything works and works well and everything is ergonomic and makes sense. Put simply, a Mac never (or very rarely) gets in the way of your work. And that makes a big difference.<p>But then, I just like Macs because of how I use my computer. I get it that some might prefer a Linux or Windows, and I respect that. I&#x27;m just extremely thankful OS X answers exactly what I expect from a computer.",1433937384

9691358,comment,9690074,9691140,0,0,mikekchar,,,"To be honest, I don&#x27;t really understand what &quot;unclamped&quot; means in this context.<p>My background is in embedded telephony.  I&#x27;ve worked on many systems that are single threaded because you have real time constraints.  You have to make sure that your bit of work finishes in a certain amount of time and then you yield to the next bit of work.  You could imagine that it would be very strange if a telephone switch handled connecting one call, but before it could connect another call it would have to &quot;rest&quot; for 15 ms.<p>The Javascript event loop is really just the reactor pattern: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern</a><p>There are many, many useful ways to use the reactor pattern.  In fact, I have often used it in preference of threads in GUI applications because it gives you very fine grained control over how much responsiveness you want in the UI.  As long as you yield every X ms, it means that the user only has to wait X ms for a response to their actions.  You can also prioritise work easily.  With threads, you are at the mercy of the task scheduler and so you might have very uneven response times.<p>In the same way, I want to be able to program things that run continuously in JS but not have to give up the responsiveness in the browser (or other IO events).  Like the original author, imagine that you are sorting thousands of records and it will take 3 seconds.  You don&#x27;t want to hang the browser for 3 seconds because maybe they want to click the &quot;cancel&quot; button.  So you yield every 50 ms.  But if you have something like a 15 ms wait time every time you yield, your 3 second task is going to take 4 seconds... for no reason at all.<p>So what I want is to be able to yield, have the system check for events and if there aren&#x27;t any, resume <i>as quickly as possible</i>.  Obviously there will be some overhead.  But sticking a timer on it and saying, &quot;I&#x27;m just going to take a brief nap&quot; really sucks.<p>The problem I&#x27;m noticing is that some people think that there should be no delay at all.  As soon as schedule a callback, it should run.  This is not desirable at all.  Again, the whole point is to yield to events and then come back.  I just don&#x27;t want to wait <i>longer</i> that it is necessary to do that.<p>To sum up, it&#x27;s not that I <i>want</i> to use 100% CPU all the time, but if it is impossible to do, then it is broken.  Similarly, if I am using 100% of the CPU and yielding every X ms, then then events should be handled every X ms (modulus the amount of time the event handler takes).",1433937286

I have seen women judge people on how much money they come from, but it&#x27;s not as strong as in other countries, and it usually/always comes from jealousy.  Yes, looks do matter.  It&#x27;s a commodity, especially when you are younger. How much money you have doesn&#x27;t come into the picture until later in life, but that&#x27;s for men.  A pretty, caring female is not judged on how much money she makes.  In a lot of circles, it might even work against her?  Some of you will call me a sexist over that statement, but it&#x27;s just something I have noticed.   A rich guy who looks/acts like Donald Trump will get his pick.  A rich women does not get the same perks.  Yes--it&#x27;s wrong, but I can care less over the happiness of the wealthy.  (There I go, I am using wealthy as a demarcation of class?  Yes, in American we do talk about the wealthy, and 1 percenter&#x27;s, but we don&#x27;t associated it with class, morals, manners, or intelligence.

I was talking about the case where a country like Germany educates for free its own citizens then they leave for greener pastures. The fact that your government managed to sell you the idea that everything is all right because at least some of the subsidized students (foreign and German) will stay is relevant only to your subjective contentment level. The overall picture can be judged pretty objectively.<p>&quot;Turns out if you spend like 5 of your formative years at one place, you kind of build roots there.&quot;<p>These kind of people would probably rooted anywhere, in any condition, as its just a thing in their nature, not something to present as a resulting advantage of a given system. Maybe a small part them came to Germany because of something unique that they couldn&#x27;t possibly find anywhere else, but I think that most likely the majority came to Germany just because of the prohibitive education costs in their own country. That&#x27;s to say someone else&#x27;s education system has a problem (by being unattractive in the current conditions) and that secures you incoming talent now. Just expecting others to continue having problems is not a very solid plan to rely on. I believe that it&#x27;s possible to design the system a little bit better, where the students that have access to subsidized education may come to feel the education debts only when they try to emigrate (and take away the results of that subsidized education) or some other kind of solution to the leakage of public investment.",1433935016

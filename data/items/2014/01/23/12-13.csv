You did not expect your comments, your videos and interactions to be linked to your real name.<p>This point I particularly identify with and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where I no longer comment on YouTube videos nor leave app reviews on Google Play because I don&#x27;t want my real name published everywhere on the web.<p>I can&#x27;t even begin to identify with the transgender community about the issues Google have willingly created.<p>I think it&#x27;s about time the EU (or other governing body) stepped in an mandated that users are entitled to pseudonyms for internet services.",1390481987

Like EUR, it would be nice to be able to withdraw our USD to our USD account in the UK!  At the moment we&#x27;re forced to withdraw it to our GBP account which is expensive.<p>- It would be nice to be able to hold up withdrawls.  At the moment our account is flooded with lots of payments, it would be nice to schedule all payments to be weekly/fornightly or a specific day of the month.  Make our accounting process a lot easier and cheaper.<p>Thanks for all the great work, I&#x27;ve been excited ever since I&#x27;ve started reading about you and am a big fan!

I have to thank the internet for connecting me to the outside world. It feels like it&#x27;s the only way out for me and I am obsessed. Thing is &quot;startups&quot; here are hell, lots of bureaucracy and so on. I tried to look away, apply for a job/internship in the U.S. but the reason is always the same: visas are hell. I would do <i>anything</i> to get my way out.<p>I study EVERY DAY so hard, University here is a mess, bad management and few very good professors. I know how to program, I have a strong passion for algorithms, data structure and complexity analysis. In addition I try to learn new things in my free time, like other programming languages, tools, etc. You know, I am in my third and final year and if it wasn&#x27;t for my curiosity now I would have no knowledge at all for REST, Python or even Maven! (Just saying)<p>I feel trapped, I am trapped. Jobs here in enterprises are that trap, you can get a job, maybe programming in Java, and stay there forever. Because here is how the things works. I can&#x27;t get my way out. I would like to pursue my educational career and I hope that my applications to English University succeed but still it&#x27;s just a try.<p>I don&#x27;t expect anything more from my situation, I really hope that someone can point me to the right direction or at least give some help.<p>Thank you HN and sorry for this post, but I had no other chance.",1390479282

This may seem ironic, but when someone puts in heroic levels of effort, they start to place less value on each minute.

For example, John Gruber speculated today that the reason Android phones have been successful is that when people go to a carrier retail store to get a phone, they get handed an Android (not because they want an Android). Thus, the Android tablet market won't act similarly.<p>Now, you might disagree with Gruber. That's perfectly reasonable. But his post is illustrative: if you can't state more clearly <i>why</i> Android phones have been successful, you can't state with confidence the same effect will apply to tablets.<p>[1]<a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/27/android-tablets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/27/android-tablets</a>",1330408710

An experienced entrepreneur and corporate executive with more than two decades of experience, Palmer will help shape and accelerate the growth of Cloudant.<p>Palmer was co-founder and founding CEO of Vertica Systems (acquired by HP). With a proven track record of seven successful startups including two IPOs in the past 20 years, Palmer has specialized in accelerating the foundation and growth of early-stage companies that span enterprise software, the Internet, ecommerce, and biotech. Prior to Vertica, Palmer was the senior vice president of operations and CIO for Infinity Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: INFI) and has held executive positions at Bowstreet (acquired by IBM), pcOrder.com and Trilogy.<p>Cloudant was founded on a brilliant premise: the data layer is something you should grow into, not out of, said Palmer. The unique technology behind the Cloudant Data Layer makes discontinuous and expensive data management infrastructure upgrades a thing of the past. But Cloudant goes beyond just continuous scaling. With Cloudant it is much easier for developers to add innovative analytics, text search, off-line computing, geo-location and other features to their web and mobile apps. Im psyched to join the Cloudant team as it shapes the future of web and mobile application development.""<p>Palmer has recently served as a founding board member for several other cloud and big data startups, including CloudSwitch (acquired by Verizon), Goby (acquired by Telenav), Recorded Future, VoltDB and Paradigm4.<p>Andy is a visionary technology leader with a brilliant entrepreneurial track record, said Derek Schoettle, CEO of Cloudant. Andys experience growing early stage companies and in Big Data will be invaluable in helping to shape Cloudants ongoing strategic and operational focus.<p>The Cloudant Data Layer<p>Cloudant is a scalable data layer (as a service) for big data applications. Built on the Apache CouchDB document database, JSON, and MapReduce, it lets developers focus on new features instead of the drudgery of growing or migrating databases. The Cloudant Data Layer is already big. It collects, stores, analyzes and distributes application data across a global network of secure, high-performance data centers, delivering low-latency, non-stop data access to users no matter where they're located. Cloudant is available as a single- or multi-tenant service.<p>Cloudant is free to start. To sign up for Cloudant, or for more information, please visit www.cloudant.com.<p>About Cloudant, Inc.<p>Cloudant, the company that builds and manages The Cloudant Data Layer, was founded in Cambridge MA in 2008 by three MIT Physicists. Frustrated by the available tools for managing and analyzing Big Data in their research, the founders set out to build a distributed, fault-tolerant, globally scalable data layer for applications, a platform that would free developers to focus on their applications knowing that they would never outgrow their data layer. Cloudants service helps power thousands of applications in organizations of all shapes and sizes, from lone developers to the Fortune 100. The Cloudant team is composed of experts in distributed systems, database technology, web services, and Big Data analysis. It proudly counts Avalon Ventures and Y Combinator among its investors.

3641959,comment,3641184,3641848,8,0,kijin,,,"Well, there are two different issues at hand:<p>1) Will there ever come a day when people can produce value merely by living? That really depends on what ""value"" is, and as you said, the standards of the day may differ from ours. Under some circumstances, merely being a consumer might be enough to contribute to some overall good. If energy becomes cheap enough, even a tiny benefit might be enough to offset a person's energy consumption.<p>2) Should we let a human being's <i>survival</i> be taken hostage to whether or not he or she produces what other people perceive as value, provided that there is leftover capacity to give them a free ride? This is more of a moral question, and your answer may vary according to your ideological commitments.",1330405230

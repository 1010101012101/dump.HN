484449,comment,482257,482650,0,0,megaduck,,,"Thanks for the link, rms.  It's a good summary of the situation.<p>For the Americans here, you can get a quick ""gut"" feeling for the hukou system by thinking about the illegal Mexican immigrants in the U.S.  Sure, they can go to any city and find low-wage blue collar work.  The odds are also pretty good that they won't be deported.  However, they're always going to be stuck at the bottom of the heap.<p>The situation is practically identical for people here in China with an ""agricultural"" residence permit.  They flock to the cities by the tens of millions to (illegally) work in factories and do construction work.  I see them every day.  It's better pay than plowing fields, but they'll forever be working dirty, dangerous, low-paying jobs.  If they do manage to climb up somehow, they'll live in constant fear of being discovered.<p>Going to a university gives you an urban registration, which is arguably even more important than the degree.",1234875186

484407,comment,484193,484394,0,0,unalone,,,"Hoo boy, this is fun. We're almost at 4000 users, and still haven't sold a single shirt, so perhaps our model's about as weak as Facebook's is. (We're both pretty averse to laying on ads.) Luckily, each user takes up no bandwidth at all, so we're doing fine right now.<p>The problem as I see it is that our 4000 users means nothing. It's a meme, essentially. Registration happens <i>so</i> quickly that our high numbers don't mean much; the fact that we're getting linked all over means a lot, but I see it as more of a ""you have to see this"" fad among friends than I see it as dedicated users. (We've got a 50% bounce rate and the average stay lasts under two minutes.)<p>Anything that we add would have to work without ruining the nature of the site. As in: right now the workflow is ""take in answers, give link to profile,"" which is very sticky but creates a path off the site pretty quickly - and removing that removes the stickiness.<p>I figure the best route to go right now is just to interact with the people we've got talking to us. We have two email addresses, one for photos and one for haiku, and we got way more submissions than I expected for a first-day submissions thing. Those are the people who're actually talking back and forth with us, so I figure they're a good place to start when it comes to expanding.

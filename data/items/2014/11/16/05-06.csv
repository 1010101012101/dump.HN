Which is too bad since at 300mph that would be a 4 minute ride :-) I expect it spends all of its time accelerating and decelerating. I suspect such trains will only be practical in the &#x27;real&#x27; world by having them in some sort of fully enclosed track. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a solid tunnel but something that keeps out birds and other debris from the area. Nothing like hitting a pigeon or catching a flying bit of branch at 300MPH, hurricanes put 2 x 4s through houses 2/3rds that speed so that would be a challenge.<p>That said the only other remarkable thing was how shaky the video was at 500km/h if the train was really moving around that much it wouldn&#x27;t be too sustainable.

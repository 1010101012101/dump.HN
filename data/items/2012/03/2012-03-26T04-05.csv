People depend on the discreet nature of physical currency - it controls the entire world of corruption (a lot of movies like to use diamonds as black market currency, but in reality its too difficult to rule out man-made diamonds these days, or to quickly evaluate the worth of a lot of diamonds).  Corruption does not occur solely among gangsters, but all manner of people - from the most prolific bankers to the most ""reputable"" politicians.  Digital currency can too easily be traced.<p>3) The government has made little effort to create its own digital currency, despite the fact that it would save tax payers billions, negating the need for the IRS, Mint, and reduce the need for the FBI and Secret Service (which monitors counterfeiting among other things)...and the corruption associated with physical currency.  You might encounter more red tape and inertia than you anticipate -- if not now then when Visa lobbies its favorite candidate to create laws that work against you.<p>4) Third world countries are not a great target for digital currency IMHO, unless they have prevalent technology and understanding of it.",1332737588

True, he mentioned in languages like Lisp where compile-time and runtime can be interleaved it would be a feasible solution, but he was focusing on statically-compiled features more in line with C++ templates, which I doubt would bring anything closer to what you were talking about.<p>C doesn't provide runtime profiling and optimization, but if performance is really critical, offline profiling to find hotspots and replacing them with pre-computed constants is a must. On average, the complexity and additional overhead brought by the JIT techniques probably won't offset the performance gain it buys compared to carefully profiled and optimized C.<p>PS.

Violence/war itself seem to be an inherent characteristic of our species. Although the per-capita amount of violent acts in the world may be decreasing, there are still large systematic shifts in power that can happen as a result of our highly structured and connected networks of economy, culture, and information. In other words (and I sincerely hope I am wrong), the probability of another world-war is only increasing. However, this highly connectedness exposes a world dichotomy in general philosophy of leadership, religion, and politics. Hopefully the spread of information through the internet will allow this dichotomy to become less of a problem. Answering the question of predictability is much more difficult.",1332736597

3754986,story,,,12,7,blueprint,"I'm looking for a few cofounders to apply to YC. Working on something huge.",,"I've spent the last 5 years working in the web and mobile industry building high quality software. Even though I don't have a degree and am largely self-taught, I doubled my salary at that job within 2 years, converted my workplace to Macs, and established the company's mobile development practice, becoming the lead mobile developer.<p>Our main product was a web CMS which we used to build custom sites and apps for people. In this process, there's a designer, and the designer must produce a design (which dictates aspects of the resultant software) according to his/her understanding of the client's needs as well as his/her amount of knowledge about computer systems. The developer then generally has to take this design and attempt to convert it into real software. Unless the designer is one of the rare people who is also an engineer, and unless this process is set up in such a way as to give the developer a high degree of input into the design, then the resultant software probably will never reach its full potential. The UI may not take full advantage of the tech, or the tech has to be redesigned or shoehorned into the client or designer spec. It's an altogether suboptimal approach to what should be a smooth and well understood process.<p>We've seen this kind of thing happen before. In the period of time before companies like Adobe and Apple ushered in the age of desktop publishing, the artist who designed something for print and those who produced/implemented it were entirely separate. The artist could of course produce copies of his work but usually it took lots of time and resources. When we got desktop publishing the game changed. Nowadays, instead of real canvases, paintbrushes, and pencils, we use tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and printers to produce high quality work.<p>Right now we are experiencing a huge shift from print and web publishing to mobile and web publishing. And the problems in the process of producing mobile apps and publications indicate a huge missing piece in the puzzle.<p>There are some solutions to these problems. But where I worked, even in my position, nobody wanted to listen to me. I got fed up, and after using a few weeks to validate these solutions, despite my high paying job but lack of long term savings, I quit my job in November 2011. I began working to launch Blueprint (https://blueprint.io), an online tool for creating iPhone apps by yourself.<p>I built the MVP and was able to launch a private beta within a few months. Since then, it's received so much interest from the people to whom I've introduced it, and we've had quite a few signups. I even have a few customers that look like they'll be purchasing within a week or two.<p>I know that Blueprint could be huge. It's exactly what designers need, not to mention the droves of people who wish they could realize their mobile app ideas but find a huge barrier in learning to code  and I have so many exciting things planned for the near future. But right now my problems is that trying to juggle all of its aspects is too much work for just one person. I want to spend my time working on iOS and product development, where I'll be able to contribute the most value. But I have had to shoulder the additional burdens of marketing, design, server-side & web app development, PR, and more.<p>I completed my application to YC (for summer 2012) last month, but I know that single founders have a slimmer chance of being accepted or taken seriously.<p>That's why I started looking for one to three smart people to join me in my quest to change the face of mobile development into what it should be.<p>* A web programming wizard, preferably someone well versed in Node.JS, who could take over development of the web app and much of the server-side aspects<p>* A publicist with a strong background in design, or a designer with a passion for marketing<p>* A hustler/businessperson who could take us to the big leagues<p>Even if you don't match any of these roles exclusively but are a capable person interested in working on this problem, I want to talk to you. You can reach me at paul _at_ blueprint _dot_ io<p>I've been networking aggressively but it's been really difficult to find the right people. The deadline for YC apps is in a few days, so I'm appealing to the HN community in case there are some heroes out there who can save the day.<p>Come work with me on Blueprint, and revolutionize how we produce mobile applications.",1332735798

Not all programmers are computer scientists, and vice-versa.<p>I understand that the title of the post is about books <i>programmers</i> recommend, but computer science extends far, far beyond programming and learning how to engineer solutions to real-world problems using algorithms.<p>The important parts to people doing research in algorithms are well-covered in CLRS, and that's part of why it's such an excellent book. It's full of rigorous proofs and a lot of theory, but that's because the point of the text is the design and analysis of <i>algorithms themselves</i>, rather than the application of them.<p>A university has an obligation to its undergraduate students majoring in computer science to teach them about computer science, and learning to think about designing algorithms, rather than merely learning about using them, is something that I would fully expect as an undergraduate majoring in computer science at any major university.<p>I suspect this is part of why more and more universities are offering degrees in Software Engineering, where the theoretical aspects of the field are not as important.",1332735068

Destiny is a pretty good player, in fact at one point he was so well known for his control of Infestors (a unit from the Zerg race) that a lot of Koreans knew of him (and his reputation) because of that alone.<p>He also is a Grandmaster at Starcraft, meaning he is in the top 200 of his region (there are 5 I believe, Americas, Europe, Korean/Taiwan, China, SE Asia). So even if he was the worst Grandmaster he is at least one of the 1000 best Starcraft 2 players in the entire world. However it would probably be very hard for him to ever crack this tournament earnings list mainly because he is at the level that is way better than average players, but not better than the top players. I'm not hating on the guy, but I think for the most part that is true. Even with his training in Korea it's still going to be pretty hard for him to gain a lot of ground on the Koreans mainly because their society accepts that playing Starcraft as a competition/sport.<p>With that being said, he mentions (from a year ago) that he earns 3.5K streaming with an additional 1.5K from teaching. That is ~60K a year from that alone. That is pretty decent money but still not something I'd quit my day job over. Then you have to keep in mind any traveling costs to compete at tournaments, the hours and hours devoted to keeping up your skill level and the fact that there are fewer SC2 players now than there were a year ago so he may not be earning as much from streaming.",1332734862

Reminds me of something I read last year about a Nigerian student building helicopters out of old cars - see <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/homemade-helicopter/nigerian-man-builds-working-helicopters-from-junk-313408.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/homemade-helicopter/nigerian-man-...</a>",1214137971

People who think ""it worked because lab coats had more status back then"" are really deluding themselves - or perhaps they're being intentionally dishonest for some reason.<p>As the documentary says, people are taught to respect and obey authority. The entire school system, military service and corporate world are exercises in surrendering your will and intelligence to a figure of authority, no matter whether they're right or wrong. As long as those systems are the norm, of course people will do what they're told.<p>Good documentary, in any case.",1214137895

However, now there's a good chance that site will flick by, two lines high, as he starts typing in the location bar before he gets too specific.  He doesn't want to wipe his whole history, but nor does he want it appearing all the time.  I can see his point.  Just type `e' and the top match isn't specific to the very vague `e' but may be embarassing.",1214136648

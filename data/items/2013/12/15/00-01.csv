And you are right that saying &quot;use HTTP&quot; is a bit hand-wavy.  XML is great at serializing <i>nouns</i> when you want to enforce the schema of those nouns.  It makes interop of nouns, verifying, quantifying, and some types of searches must faster and consistent.  XML was a reaction to widespread RPC and endless bit-order compat that wasted so many lines of code.  It comes from the same mindset as the people who made SQL -- &quot;conforming to schemas is good and what most people want.&quot;<p>However, in the last 10 years we&#x27;ve seen that it isn&#x27;t possible to conform to a single schema as requirements change, and that is why XML has generally lost favor to JSON.  This is a similar reason why NoSQL wins in many cases over SQL.<p>HTTP, in contrast to XML, is a set of <i>verbs</i> (called methods) and <i>identifiers</i> (typically urls), which is similar to what a file system is.  It leaves the <i>nouns</i> (the body in HTTP) to the application, but it does promote some properties (headers in HTTP) and have conventions for common properties (content-type).  The big difference between HTTP and most file systems is that HTTP is stateless, whereas many file operations are stateful (get a handle to a stream, write to a stream, close the stream).<p>HTTP would work as the API for a file system because it provides pretty good addresses for both local and remote and relatively low-level operations.<p>HTTP also has the benefit of being widely adopted, even during the Cairo development, which would have solved the chicken-and-the-egg problem from the first essay.<p>Using HTTP as a file system has key drawbacks: Applications would have to be re-written to use both the new APIs and new mindset of possibly high-latency operations.  You can&#x27;t always assume that a particular endpoint will be available, unlike many assumptions about inodes.<p>So, do I think they <i>should</i> have done this?  Maybe, there were a lot of variables at play.  But, I don&#x27;t think it is a crazy idea to use HTTP as the file system, and I predict we will see a popular -- nay, credible -- operating system use it within the next 5 years.<p><i>And I also think it&#x27;s telling that even in the post-mortem hindsight, the author fails to see alternatives that were widely available in the industry because they weren&#x27;t invented at Microsoft.</i>",1387069124

6907771,comment,6907592,6907592,22,0,marvin,,,"Is there anyone with airline pilot experience who could come with some detailed analysis of this? To me, I would hazard a guess that whomever was controlling the airplane was unaware on short final that the autothrottle had been deactivated. This is consistent with pulling back on the control column to maintain altitude, an action which will give in the desired result when the autothrottle is engaged, but must be accompanied by manually increasing throttle otherwise. This is an elementary piloting mistake, which I believe is impossible to do in the Airbus since the fly-by-wire system will prevent you from placing the aircraft in a stall condition. So this might be consistent with the information that the captain was transitioning from the Airbus to the Boeing. However, I would be surprised if the investigation doesn&#x27;t provide additional details about the human factors among the flight crew.<p>I guess the biggest question I&#x27;m left with after this is how professional pilots can make this kind of elementary piloting mistake: Not watching the airspeed on final approach, and not reacting immediately when the PAPI indicates that the aircraft is too low. I was left with the same kind of question after the Air France disaster; this plane was stalled straight into the ocean from cruising altitude. It&#x27;s a big mystery to me how three pilots could overlook this condition for four minutes. Maybe this is just the kind of fluke accident that will happen sometimes when you have ten thousand airliners in the sky every day. But it seems like a good idea to investigate whether pilots rely too much on the computers and forget the basics.<p>Regardless, let&#x27;s not draw any conclusions until the investigation has had its say.

They enforce the perception that cycling is dangerous. Finally, as the study showed, they are designed to only be involved in an accident between you and the road. Not another vehicle. They bring a false sense of security.<p>If cycle helmets were made compulsory in the UK, it is calculated that an extra 253 people per year would die from obesity related diseases ( <a href=\"http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1231.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1231.html</a> ) . Ironically cycle helmets kill.<p>What is interesting about this is the identification of two groups of cyclists. The &#x27;speed&#x27; group who currently wear helmets (and usually have lycra) and then the slow group (the rest of society) who just want to go from A to B. Helmet laws specifically have a negative impact on the slow group. This is the group of people that we need to encourage.<p>As mentioned in the BMJ article ( <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3817?ijkey=I5vHBog6FhaaLzX&keytype=ref\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3817?ijkey=I5vHBog6FhaaL...</a> ) :\n&quot;For others, this is an explicitly political matter, where an emphasis on helmets reflects a seductively individualistic approach to risk management (or even “victim blaming”) while the real gains lie elsewhere. It is certainly true that in many countries, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, cyclists have low injury rates, even though rates of cycling are high and almost no cyclists wear helmets. This seems to be achieved through interventions such as good infrastructure; stronger legislation to protect cyclists; and a culture of cycling as a popular, routine, non-sporty, non-risky behaviour.&quot;<p>This stuff is important. The UK justice system is permeated with the belief that if you were not wearing a helmet then you were, in some way, partially responsible. It&#x27;s got so bad that insurance payouts are being affected by this.<p>Note I personally don&#x27;t wear a cycle helmet except in winter when I want to have a bigger light to see the trail ahead of me as I commute to work. However if I go out on a club ride then I wear one. I&#x27;m pushing the speed of the bike and it could slip out from under me. I do not wear it with the belief it would save me if I had a collision with a car.",1387067439

One problem I see with data in RDBMSs is that data gets transformed in the process of importing it to match the schema, and this transformation loses information, i.e. it&#x27;s hard to recover the original meaning and context, because it&#x27;s been contorted to fit the schema. Schemas tend to need to evolve, and so you&#x27;d like not to be stuck with the assumptions of schema 1.0 forever. Data isn&#x27;t that big these days in relation to the speed of computers, so you could keep the data in its original form and leave open the ability to &quot;reimport&quot; to fit the current schema as needed. If you&#x27;re building a website, for instance, then your web app is going to be doing a limited number of queries over and over. If you start from the queries, you can infer things about how the data should be organized, e.g. which indexes are needed. In fact, if you took a query and pre-generated all the possible results of that query and saved them, that&#x27;s basically an index, the one that fits that query. The inputs to this hypothetical database would be the original unprocessed data, the set of queries you need, and mappings to transform the unprocessed data into queryable form, i.e. the equivalent of a schema.

Further, the current mail stack was just not built for a good mobile experience, and it&#x27;s complexity provides a considerable barrier for emerging mobile clients. We want to cut off the legacy baggage and keep the entry barrier for users and developers as low as possible.<p>What new features?  Current email infrastructure already implements everything mentioned on this page.  There&#x27;s mention of the &quot;limitations&quot; of IMAP and SMTP but it seems specious.  Reading email is a pretty well solved problem now, and I think every popular language has libraries for IMAP and SMTP.<p>On the topic of IMAP&#x27;s performance on mobile: there is an installed base of millions who use IMAP for their mail on their phones.  There are many, many good email clients for Android (I recommend K-9 Mail, which is FOSS) and they work great.  Presumably it is the same for iOS.<p>If they write a nice HTTP API for reading mail inboxes, that will probably be a nice option for people who for some reason can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to use IMAP, but there really is nothing here to move mail forward.<p>Mailpile is a lot more interesting (webmail and privacy features): <a href=\"https://www.mailpile.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mailpile.is/</a>",1387066438

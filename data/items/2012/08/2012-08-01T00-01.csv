She was largely passed over for swimming in high school, but came to be one of the most dominant masters and open-water swimmers of all time.  A few decades back I had the distinct pleasure of being beat by over 4 minutes by her, which I figured was fine given that she had a 40 year head start.
<a href=""http://www.girlscantwhat.com/meet-gail-roper-the-most-dominant-swimmer-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.girlscantwhat.com/meet-gail-roper-the-most-domina...</a><p>The ""you can do anything"" mentality is, of course, false on its face.  Athletes, entrepreneurs, and artists, when confronted with a microphone shoved into their face, will say whatever damned fool thing pops into their head, sometimes honestly, often not.  If you want to know the real secrets to their success, look at what they do, not what they say.<p>And yes, Phelps is a genetic freak pretty much uniquely suited to swimming.<p>He's also just another human being.  And at the end of a race, his muscles and lungs are burning just like anyone else's would be.<p>That said, the accomplishment domain most of us are competing in is ""doing stuff"", surrounded by others trying to do the same thing.   <i>If you want to become accomplished at something</i>, then a mix of innate ability, talent, and hard work will push you somewhere toward the envelope.  Perhaps well inside, perhaps outside.<p>A huge part of success, beyond what you <i>can't</i> control (your genes, circumstances, starting at age 7) is to practice efficiency in how you go about reaching your goal.  As many hours as a person puts into pursuing a given goal, there are far more hours spent <i>not</i> pursing it.  In the tech world, most of us come to realize that beyond a few hours a day, if we're lucky, we're not terribly productive.<p>Athletes may spend a few hours a day engaged in training, but the real pay-off moments may be a few minutes of Tabata intervals, or a set or two of max-effort lifts.  Everything else is preparation, support, preventive measures, recovery, or just plain goofing around.  What's impressive is how <i>little</i> of the <i>right</i> effort is required to <i>improve</i> your ability.  Perhaps not win you a gold medal, but at least to nudge you in that direction.<p>In another context I saw yet another question of the form ""how much can I expect to progress if I do X?"", and saw the usual responses, some backed with links to substantial research, of what typical and outstanding progress might be.  One response came close to what I realized was the right answer: ""and if you don't hit some goal rate of progress, are you going to quit?"".<p>The answer is:  you'll make more progress than if you don't do X.<p>So:  pick a reasonable goal, within the realms of physics and biological attainability.  Find out if it really suits you (are you doing this for you, for for someone else).  Find effective means of attaining your goal.  Apply those methods.  Monitor your progress.  You may find you are able to go further. You may find the goal is out of reach. You may find the goal doesn't interest you.<p>But you tried, and you learned something.",1343782667

You <i>could</i> in theory watch every channel 24/7 for the same basic rate.  The basic costs associated with cable are related to the infrastructure to bring the signal to your house, plus whatever licensing fees for content that are essentially passed through.<p>With Internet plans, we are charged repetitively for multiple devices, and in essence you are basically discouraged (throttling, excess usage fees) from actually using the service to 100% of the contracted rates over the billing period.<p>For example, I have on my account 2 iPhones with data plans (mine, wife's), 1 with tethering (mine), and 1 4G USB dongle.  I went over the 5G limit on the dongle, but both of the basic data plans on the iPhones were under budget for the month, and I hardly used the tethering.  Do you think I'll get a break from Verizon, or any kind of 'net usage' billing for the overage on the 4G dongle?<p>As others have pointed out in other threads, the mobile Internet space is ripe for disruption.  It's not going to come from 2 college drop-outs on a $15,000 Y Combinator budget, but it's going to happen as soon as the economy lights up a little bit and we get some real infrastructure investment rolling.",1343782527

4320528,comment,4319276,4319869,11,0,drostie,,,"There is an advantage to the original formulations of QM and they are precisely these. It's true that in Quantum Field Theory you don't see these Bell Inequality ideas and I've seen people working in Quantum Information theory who struggle to prove that you can multiply a wavefunction by an arbitrary phase factor and it is an unobservable change. QFT has real current statistics and Lagrangian densities and Feynman diagrams, which give you a much more tangible feel of what physics you're describing.<p><i>In my experience it is just another math course and there is no Physics anywhere.</i><p>Heisenberg equations of motion are a good place to start. The original way we stumbled upon quantum mechanics was due to Heisenberg, who noticed that a lot of the wavy stuff people wanted to explain could be explained if Hamilton's equations of motion df/dt = {f, H} + f/t were generalized by treating x(t) and p(t) as matrices and insisting that they do not commute, leaving instead [x, p] = i  as a matrix version of an ""uncertainty principle.""<p>The corresponding quantum equation for an observable  is that d/dt = i [/, ], which allows you to start (most famously) with a harmonic oscilator  and derive the Hamilton equations dx/dt = p/m, dp/dt = - k x, precisely <i>due to</i> the failure of x and p to commute.<p>So you get this direct connection between known physics equations and the quantum theory, and often the same thing which is responsible for driving the uncertainty relation also drives all of classical physics.<p><i>What does a particle with some particular wave function look like?</i><p>|Psi|^2 in the appropriate basis, I should say.<p><i>As it evolves in time it ""smears"" out according to the time evolution equations, but how fast is the process? Does it occur on scale of nanoseconds? Seconds? Hours? </i><p>In quantum mechanics there is a discrete energy level spacing E, and the answer is that <i>no observable can change</i> much faster than  / E. For the harmonic oscillator for example, nothing can change much faster than 1/ by this criterion.<p><i>What exactly is an example of a measurement?</i><p>This can get a little touchy but a good example is a photon hitting a photomultiplier tube and generating a click -- especially if you start to play with the polarization of the photon to generate entanglement and so forth.<p>Edit: With all that said, I highly recommend watching Feynman's New Zealand lectures which explain, among other things, why CDs show rainbow patterns (in a time, sadly, before people had CDs and so Feynman kind of just says ""I wish I could have brought you an example."") <a href=""http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8</a>",1343781965

Just acknowledge it's difficult and move on.""<p>People act like being ""world class"" is some big mystery, but not in the 21st century. Extensive research has come to the conclusion that deliberate practice, over a long period of time, with the appropriate guidance of coaches and mentors is necessary and mostly sufficient to produce expertise in a field.<p>No, I don't think anyone can be Michael Phelps. In fact, it is clear that physical advantages go a long way in sports and athletic events. In almost everything else though, the right approach can produce mastery. The Polgar family is a living example of that w.r.t. chess. And most people are not looking to become world champions - they simply want to be successful in their endeavors. For that to happen, you must apply the same principles. To lose weight, I agree that saying ""just diet and work out"" is difficult, but most effective programs are either a result of intrinsic motivation or someone implementing a gradual program where you first cut out some sugar, then all soda, then cake, then you start eating one good meal a day, and so on and so forth.<p>In my view, this post marginalizes human willpower, which I consider one of the strongest forces in the world. Sure you won't be Michael Phelps, but you could say ""No matter how hard you try, you will never become a Redwood,"" and I think the result is the same.

I get why designers choose it, they want to make the page look lively and balance content all over the place but it's terrible for readability. It breaks natural eye flow from left to right then top to bottom. With magazine style layouts, your eyes have to go all over the place to skim through the content and that just gets annoying. If they wanted to avoid looking like a blog but still keep the lively look and feel they could have tried a grid like layout where at least the stories are aligned horizontally in a straight line.<p>The style itself is really nice, blocky and beautifully simple. This is how you redesign a content site, its elements are purposely made minimal, simple, and sterile so that the content stands out above everything else. The site disappears and the content takes the stage. Basically, it puts the spotlight on the performer rather than the stage. Also, the site's so lightweight that it just feels fast. Very few elements are begging for your eye's attention which is great, it allows the eyes to go straight for the image and title.

Saying ""the USSR did this"" feels like too much of a cheat and a weasel word.  It reminds me of the whole ""mistakes were made"" line.  After all, the USSR never did anything.  It has no arms and legs.  Everything was done by people.<p>Now, the question just remains as to which people get to be counted in that ""we"".  Here, I'll move back to your sports team comment.  The players obviously have the right to say ""we won"", since they were out there scoring points.  The coach, however, was not.  Does he get included in the ""we""?  How about the athletic trainer who fixed up the star player after an injury.  Does he get to count himself?  The team's owner didn't  score any goals or pick any plays.  Her contributions were far more abstract and mostly economic.  Does she count?  How about the station who paid the owner for the broadcasting rights?  It's more nebulous and economic than the owner's claim, but still largely the same.<p>If the TV station seems like a step too far, imagine that it wasn't a soccer game, but rather gladiatorial combat that they were paying to broadcast.  If someone at the station said ""We killed fifty prisoners this evening"", would you correct them that they hadn't actually killed anyone?  How about the network's sponsors?  Or the audience?  They'd have just as much involvement with the prisoners being stabbed as they would with the goal in the soccer game.

The thought of the nature of our minds being defined by a disease that we caught at some point in time and now completely identify with it, that that disease made us forget our true nature. It's pretty great as a sci-fi scenario, but I now believe it has a deep truth to it.<p>I later discovered the writings of Eckhart Tolle. According to him, we are diseased in the sense that we identify with our mind/ego, instead of realizing what it actually is: a tool. Part of the problem is we often don't know what exists underneath. We are 100% convinced we are our mind. But obviously we're not - if we were, we wouldn't be able to observe it. Once we realize we're not our mind, we're free of its control. Until we do, we're in a way, severely ill. We're actually not disfunctional in our true nature - but we're unenlightened.<p>At least that's what Eckhart Tolle says. I personally find it disarmingly logical - and reasonably easily provable within my perception, not to mention deeply liberating/changing. Finding out you can stop your thoughts and not only still be aware, but become the most aware you can be, that's quite a doozy of a realization.",1343780260

I do not understand why protecting those margins are my responsibility, or anyone's responsibility other than Verizon's.<p>We're not talking about some cable in the ground upon which Verizon exerts a legal property interest.  We're talking about the airwaves that are the permanent heritage of the taxpayer (or arguably land owner), which we as a landlord collectively and temporarily rent out for our sole benefit, in an adversarial negotiation.   The <i>whole point</i> of a negotiation is to increase your own margins, often at the expense of the other party's.  To say our analysis does this is to say it represents our interests.",1343779219

There are nobel prizes waiting for the answers to some of them.<p><i>Warning: The following is not precisely target at your post.</i><p>The core of  some your questions are the kind answerable only with mu. Essentially, you are asking for some physical intuitions to relate the quantum world up to the world as we see it. But the thing is that there is very little in our macroscopic reality that relates to the quantum world. All analogies are broken. Here's the key thing to realize. Quantum mechanics is hard not because it is complex =). Far from it. It hard because we have no mental basis with which to represent its concepts. The opposite should hold too. A Quantum intuition would find our world bizarre, very hard to understand and - unlike how we feel about QM - justifiably complex. But if one takes a multicultural appreciation approach to how systems evolve, QM becomes a bit less offensive to one's sensibilities.<p>The only path to approximate intuition is to drill the math and think about the concepts.  Simulations are another great option. They allow one to create a rope bridge from the math to something that feels a bit more concrete. Still not intuitive but better than nothing. The idea is to get to the point where you can use the math as  a map. So you won't ever be able to feel as comfortable with it as galilean relativity but you can form questions, think about reality and use the map to guide your mind. I am the opposite of you - I think a lot of the physical or incidentals of experiments are useless baggage for building that map.<p><i>What does a particle with some particular wave function look like?</i><p>At this point it is not useful to think about how things look. Focusing on what things ""look"" like would again be just be a rough analogy, possibly misleading (similar in spirit to focusing too much on tangent lines for derivatives) and might create a false crutch by waylaying the brain from becoming more comfortable with the abstract surroundings.  And then there is the question of: is the wave function? Does it make sense to think of it as something physical? (I don't think so).<p><i>Does it occur on scale of nanoseconds? Seconds? Hours?</i><p>While kinda opposite in direction to your questions, work on decoherence is answering some questions of timing. But nothing will shed light on entanglement, coherence and aspects of measurements better than quantum computers. Lets hope they get invented soon or less preferably, proven not to be possible. Each would learn us a lot.",1343779213

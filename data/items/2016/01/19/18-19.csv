I tried keto for a while and it raised my fasting blood glucose levels to pre-diabetic levels. As soon as I went back to a moderate carb intake, my blood glucose was back to near-ideal. Obviously you should take further tests (HbA1C) to be absolutely sure if you&#x27;re at risk, but it&#x27;s not all smiles and rainbows for keto, you really need to make sure your body can actually adapt properly to the changes that are going on in your body as a result of the diet that promotes keto.",1453229991

During most of human history people didn&#x27;t have plenty of carbs available all day long, so ketosis was most likely the normal state and not an exception.<p>&quot;Starvation mode&quot; because of eating less is generally just a myth and an excuse for people why their diet failed.",1453229986

Some would say they have the ‘Products’ table and then they&#x27;d have ‘productid’, others would have ‘product_id’, some people would have ‘prod_id’ or ‘p_id’ or ‘P_id’, and every time somebody made a new design decision it meant configuration. You now have to tell your models, your objects, how they&#x27;re going to talk to this database table. Because it needs to know what the hell you called the freaking primary key column, and it just doesn&#x27;t matter! Who cares what the primary key column is called? It just doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s going to have zero impact on the usefulness of your application.&quot;</i><p>and<p><i>&quot;‘Dont repeat yourself’ is all about not having the same intentions spread out in multiple places. Don&#x27;t have one configuration. If you&#x27;re calling something, let&#x27;s again take the example of the primary key. If you&#x27;re calling that for ‘id’ you shouldn&#x27;t have to configure that in three different places that all have to work together and all have to be changed together. You should just pick one authoritative place to have that information stored. And then you can make changes from there. It also goes with the the whole Ruby idiom: we don&#x27;t want those Java boilerplate ten line things: that&#x27;s repeating yourself. If you have the same idiom, if you have the same intentions, that should really be exceedingly a short expression. And that goes up throughout the entire framework. Just keep one place to change those things, and keep the idioms very short.&quot;</i>",1453229783

Which you do want to compare to your &quot;investment&quot; of $750K...<p>So your post is very good advice to everyone. I encourage you to apply similar math. Of course, the hard part to evaluate is the variation: maybe the exit is 10X better. Or maybe it&#x27;s 10X worse. How valuable is a high-risk/high-reward payoff? At least, by doing this math, you put hard numbers on just how high the payoff can be. If it turns out to be no so high, that&#x27;s a great help to your decision.",1453229768

But also a few problems.<p>For instance, If you can track focus, you can make the monitor seem larger than it really is. Just scale everything that isn&#x27;t being looked at down a bit. As the gaze shifts towards other objects, shift things slowly around and overlap the enlarged window over other background windows.<p>You can make focus-dependent shortcuts. Imagine vim with nouns and motions that can refer to and act on the focus point. `ytF`: yank-to-focus, where F is a motion from cursor to focus.

10932852,comment,10930423,10932415,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"In most start-ups, you do not get much autonomy and you are also heavily prevented from influencing the product. In the rare cases where you can &quot;influence&quot; the product, you&#x27;re still expected to simply implement the ideas of others for a long, long time, as you would be expected to do anywhere, before you get the chance to add your own ideas to the mix (if you ever do).<p>You also need to factor in that start-ups pay generally a below-market wage, and often do not have benefits on par with other employment options.<p>For a long time, the standard argument has been that you should view the expected payoff of the equity as a form of offsetting compensation. If your salary is X-thousand below market, but under average-case circumstances your equity is worth Y-thousand-per-year, and Y == X, then, in theory, you should view the offer as exactly a &quot;market&quot; pay rate. Of course there are also effects of being forced to defer compensation to the future, deal with tax implications, and potentially also be compensated for risk of failure, and so forth, so Y should actually have to be significantly above X, but the general idea is the same.<p>If you view the equity as lottery tickets (and I agree that you should), but you <i>also</i> accept a below market pay rate, or bad benefits (like an onerous regular premium for insurance, or the absence of a company matched 401(k), or extreme working hours, and so on), then you are basically doing nothing but accepting a job for below-market pay, without getting a single thing as a compensating benefit in return.<p>You are literally doing nothing but devaluing your own labor and by sending the market signal that employers are capable of hiring you like this, you are also contributing to driving the price of labor in your field down overall too, which could hurt your peers and your future self.<p>There are often further negatives about start-ups too. For one, they often try to cram you into low-productivity open-plan offices, but then turn around and try to defend it with buzzwords about teamwork and company culture. In <i>some</i> start-ups, your visible enthusiasm for the arbitrary workplace choices of the management is also a component of how you are evaluated. If you&#x27;re <i>merely neutral</i> about something like, say, dog-friendly offices or frequent alcohol-focused gatherings, as opposed to being <i>visibily excited about them</i>, this often is held against you when it comes time for raises or promotions or, more often, layoffs.<p>Many start-ups don&#x27;t really think for themselves either. They use management processes like Agile/Scrum because it gives management a convenient fiction that the company&#x27;s development work can be commoditized, and that they can hot-swap new employees in at any time. They are notorious about not doing proper capacity planning or planning around an engineer&#x27;s specialties. You might have been hired because you&#x27;re great at front-end work and then end up spending 100% of your time migrating customer data from MySQL to Postgres. Or you might be a mathematics / statistics worker and spend all your time making web applications in Django. It will all be covered by catch-all excuses about the company pivoting or you needing to wear lots of hats or some bullshit, and if you raise any discontent over how much disrespect is being shown for your specialty or aptitudes, it will be ignored or punished.<p>And after all of this, the best case scenario, which is exponentially unlikely, is that you&#x27;ll make a small amount of money from your stock options (assuming you saved enough from your below-market salary to actually exercise them), which still won&#x27;t be enough to buy a house in the Bay Area.<p>I&#x27;m not saying start-ups are tautologically bad places to work. It would be great if at least some of them began acting as responsible employers. But, you really need to deeply consider a lot of this stuff before choosing to work for a start-up, and really have a clear understanding of what other benefit you are getting (maybe your significant other lives near the start-up and you don&#x27;t need money or respect at work?).<p>The fact that so many people accept these bad working conditions is our own fault, as a community of developers, and until more engineers (especially younger ones) start to stick up for themselves by boycotting jobs that infantilize them, we have only ourselves to blame for the horrendous working conditions we&#x27;re made to accept.",1453229046

As an example, a friend built a prototype in a couple months and with the help of someone else, he was able to raise a $1M note at a $10M cap.  With 50% of the company he now has $4.5M in equity.  But it’s all imaginary.  Without an exit it means nothing.<p>Employees are the ones who need to watch out for this, because the founders turn around and try to pretend the equity is real.  An offer of $200k of this fake equity isn’t really $200k.  And for you to ‘get rich’ and 10x your $200k, you will need to 10x the founders $4.5M of fake equity.   All the founders need to do is see an exit and they are rich since the initial seed round gives them millions.<p>So don’t worry about $ numbers, just the percent of the company.  If it is early, understand the cap table and fight for your fair share.  And don’t stop fighting, especially if you are adding value.  Remember the founders got millions of ‘fake equity’, they can and should share.  Don’t forget that the ebullient founders see a payday on most any exit whereas you won’t.  I like the advice that you are either learning or earning, and if you aren’t founding you most likely are learning.<p>Also, don’t let people talk you far below market salary since you aren’t just giving up big company salary, but also bonus and stock.  Most of all though, you need to trust the founders since it’s easy for them to screw you and easy for them to screw everyone if they don’t make the right moves.  Even if you build a good product and get customers, if there are bad ratchet clauses everyone but the investors will get screwed.<p>This is geared more toward early stage.

If this paper originated it, then the resulting waterfalls say more about the readers and IT culture than the visionary that recommended a very, adaptive process. A few points on the paper.<p>The author describes the software development as a creative process. Most managers and even many CompSci researchers thought it was mechanical with potential for automation and assembly-line type guidance. He wisely contradicts that in a way that I hope was to help us all out by putting reality in management reader&#x27;s heads.<p>I used to think one person did waterfall followed by other models (eg Spiral) realizing initial work usually failed and is rewritten. Now I know it&#x27;s the opposite: waterfall author knew requirements or design would require rewrites. Even made new diagrams for it. Diagrams most of us never saw while ideal model was plastered everywhere. He underestimates how difficult coding part can be but his claims still proved out with methods like Cleanroom and Correct-by-Construction that kept coding structures simple. Almost all defects happened outside of coding and coding changes were straight-forward.<p>The documentation chapter is pure gold. Managing scope, preventing excuses during failures, ensuring everyone is on same page, rules to keep it consistent even by halting development, wisely noting maintenance/rework phase is horrible enough that docs are a necessity, and handing off system to cheaper, ops people. Those particularly stood the test of time.<p>In one section, he recommends implementing <i>something</i> to get the process started even if one doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. That&#x27;s to avoid paralysis by analysis and give something tangible to start with. Ironically, &quot;modern&quot; and anti-waterfall methods recommend exactly that.<p>The simulation part is tripping some people up and a weird read. People take it too literally. What I&#x27;m seeing is a call for prototypes that explore some of the user interface, key calculations, structure, I/O, and other trouble spots. The stakeholders each review a bit of this to spot early requirements and design problems. The next section mentions feedback loops that do the same thing which collectively result in buy-in by those paying. Just shows he wisely considered a critical human factor that led to many project failures later on.<p>So, it was a short and delightful read whose advice should&#x27;ve led to many successful projects and hastened arrival of more Agile methods. Instead, people cherry-picked his points and even slandered him in subsequent work. All kinds of disaster followed.<p>Least I know now that the real Waterfall was designed to prevent that and probably would have most of the time. So, props to Dr. Royce for being one of the giants whose shoulders we stand on trying to make IT great. Well, should&#x27;ve stood on for many. ;)",1453228570

Ruby is roughly described as &quot;batteries included.&quot; Some people don&#x27;t prefer this, as it encourages meta-programming and introspection rather than explicit instructions.<p>A lot of libraries and tools around Ruby use meta-magic; some libraries have been attempting to strike a middle ground with meta magic, such as Datamapper (explicit) vs ActiveRecord (implicit).

While I&#x27;m a little fuzzy on the specific details of the current transistor geometries (14nm?! that&#x27;s wild!), I do pretty much understand the entire stack upwards from there. I could design a fully-functional computer from the logic gate level, although it likely would be slow as hell and be exceptionally boring. It&#x27;s not my strong point, but I understand enough about what&#x27;s going on.<p>Honestly, most of my electronic design work these days is analog circuits slung onto the side of a microcontroller, with code written in C. I&#x27;ll do schematic design and capture, and board layout without too much difficulty.<p>Going up from there, I&#x27;ve written my own (toy) operating system from scratch. I&#x27;ve written Linux kernel drivers for both off-the-shelf devices and for custom devices implemented in FPGAs. High-bandwidth/low-latency TCP servers written in C. My own (toy) programming language. I&#x27;ve written C extensions for PHP and Python, and have done pretty intense profiling work on them; this requires a pretty deep understanding of how the internals of the interpreter work (part of my MSc coursework). And I&#x27;ve done web apps in PHP, Python, Ruby, and Elixir.<p>The whole point of this is that I&#x27;m totally comfortable going as deep into the stack of abstractions as necessary to solve whatever problem I&#x27;m facing. When I started learning Rails, I was mystified by all of the &quot;magic&quot;. I&#x27;d never even really used Ruby, let alone all the extra stuff Rails does. But I set up the emacs-bundler library (<a href=""https://github.com/tobiassvn/bundler.el"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tobiassvn/bundler.el</a>) and started diving in. I&#x27;d work through a tutorial, and every time I encountered something I didn&#x27;t understand, I&#x27;d dive into the guts of Rails (bundle-open activerecord) and read the code until I understood it.<p>As an example of going a layer deeper, I once encountered a bug in a Python script that used PySerial. There were multiple threads, and the script would hang sometimes. I read through my code and couldn&#x27;t find any problems, so I dug deeper into the PySerial code. Nothing obvious in the .py file for PySerial, so I dug deeper into the C extension. In the C code, I discovered that there was one case where the GIL wasn&#x27;t being properly released before doing a (sometimes) blocking call! Tada! The script worked great if the call didn&#x27;t block, but hung if it did.",1453228341

Her IG account may, in fact have been hacked.  This happens.  She&#x27;s obviously afraid and angry.  She is the kind of person who thinks she can solve all of her own problems, and found the licenses section of the app, which included something with a nonsensical name (libcurl) and a domain &quot;haxx.se&quot;.  Despite having known that haxx.se is for libcurl basically forever, I occasionally see it and associate it with gray or black hat stuff before I remember.

So here&#x27;s what the author should have done:<p>1 ) Patiently explain what libcurl does (it let&#x27;s programs request web pages, just like a browser).  Explain that he&#x27;s the author, but he&#x27;s given it away for free.  The license is in the app because he took pains to ensure that nobody can package it up with some slick marketing and sell what he&#x27;s giving away free.<p>2 ) Acknowledge that haxx.se sounds kind of shady.  Explain why he chose the domain.  Self deprecating humor would be great here.  Explain that despite this, all kinds of apps use libcurl for perfectly benevolent purposes.<p>3 ) Explain that he has nothing to do with instagram (commenters have suggested the car parts analogy, which seems like a good plan).<p>4 ) Finally, and most importantly, link her to their hacked accounts page!

I&#x27;d go back to whomever the authority is with regards to what the function is supposed to do, or to the spec, and then rewrite it from scratch.  This won&#x27;t ensure that it behaves as it does now but with a little bit added - it will ensure that it behaves as per the specification / user requirement.  If the function is that huge, with just if&#x27;s, it&#x27;s very likely that it&#x27;s buggy and that those bugs haven&#x27;t been addressed.  They won&#x27;t be addressed if you duplicate the functionality in a refactor unless you can get a handle on the purpose of the thing to begin with.

Especially when it’s your application that breaks from a backwards-incompatible change in a major version of Rails. It’s at those times we need to remember this value, that we cherish progress over stability...<p>I encountered this doctrine first hand.  A division of a company I worked at had its division&#x27;s website rewritten in RoR by some outside consultants. Even brand new, it was a mess of Ruby gems of conflicting dependencies which was undeployable.  The build system was a train wreck as well.  Some of the main web pages of their web sites like rubygems.org were not available - the web site had &quot;progressed&quot; and when you clicked on a link, the page explaining anything had disappeared. I mean hell, go to rubyforge.org this minute (1:15 PM EST) - it is down, of course. The blog of the author of the Ruby gem that then was the main gem that handled web serving did not inspire confidence.<p>As I would have to maintain it (as a sysadmin, not programmer), I refused to deploy the system, since it was an unreproducable mess of conflicting gems and gem versions and kludges.  They decided to pay the RoR consultants additional money, despite them having never delivered a working system.  By the time I left, it still was never deployed.  The division closed dozens of offices soon after, and then the division shut down - perhaps not completely related, but probably somewhat related to this project.<p>Meanwhile, the company&#x27;s other divisions had decent programmers programming for Java application servers, and that code and those servers were much more solid.  Builds rolled out easily (and could easily be rolled back if need be).  It was really night and day.  It makes sense this contempt for stability is explicitly part of their doctrine.",1453227161

The global positioning system, he said, “makes us vulnerable to attacks, it is impossible to use in the valleys of Afghanistan or in a big city [where signals are blocked], or in places where the signal is poor.” “At DoD, we worry about enemies jamming GPS signals.” Army Maj. Christopher Brown, who helps run the service’s efforts in position, navigation and timing, or PNT,  told C4ISR & Networks last year. “Threats to military GPS have evolved and improved at a rapid pace — from a proliferation of small-scale commercial jamming devices that can readily be purchased on eBay to large-scale military anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities.”<p>So the real benefits here are: works in mountains, and future-proofs against better GPS jamming.",1453226912

The best book on programming for the layman is\n      &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;; but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s \n      the best book on anything for the layman.\n</code></pre>\nBut for their incompleteness, the Perlis&#x27;s Epigrams wouldn&#x27;t a bad crash course. [1] Peter Norvig&#x27;s take [2] is also insightful.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m in the <i>No Silver Bullet</i> camp [3]. This stuff is hard. When I might forget that fact, I pick up Knuth&#x27;s <i>TAoCP</i> and conclude that someone spending more than 50 years writing less than half a book is pretty good evidence that this stuff is hard...I don&#x27;t even have to look at the 30 rated exercises.<p>I can&#x27;t know it all. In the days before the internet when my younger self believed I was up on things,  it was simply because I didn&#x27;t have access to much information. Now I know that I don&#x27;t know most things. Fortunately most things are only somewhat interesting and there&#x27;s always something shinier. I&#x27;ve learned that learning a lot doesn&#x27;t mean I know very much relative to the sum total of what people know or what there is to know.<p>Avoiding terminology is the route to being like the person who buys a iguana at PetCo and then argues with herpetologists online. Words are how we communicate.<p>Good luck.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf</a>",1453226421

For all but professional musicians, it&#x27;s a hobby - just like some people like building cars, or program, or do woodworking, or a million of other things that require skill and experience to achieve mastery. And this mastery requires a creativity that computer do not have, and in my opinion, will never get unless we come up with a radical new computation model.<p>The satisfaction you get from sitting down, and play some music that express your current emotions exactly, or the emotional state you&#x27;d like to be in, is just great. I played the piano as a child, and for reasons out of my control I stopped, and have never really been able to pick it up again.

That is, create a hashtable which record the times that the characters a-Z appear in S1 and create another hashtable for S2. If the two hashtables have the same content, then the strings are identical.  This solution requires O(n) time to create two hashtables and compare them, and O(52) = O(1) space to store the hashtable.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m so disgusted. I was way off. Not even close.

This probably isn&#x27;t a larger strategy or play at Microsoft.  It might be a sign of internal change among developers there, which might change their business strategy at some point in the future, but they&#x27;re definitely don&#x27;t seem to be &quot;throwing their weight around&quot; just yet.<p>They already have far larger investments in plenty of other CMSes:<p>* Sharepoint (the goose that lays the golden eggs),<p>* Umbraco (which IIRC runs asp.net, iis.net, windowsazure.com, and possibly [parts of] technet and msdn),<p>* Orchard (which is theirs, albeit through the OuterCurve foundation, which is one of MS&#x27; OSS outreaches),<p>* MCMS (which is horribly old & expensive, but still out there and in use),<p>* A bunch of internal CMSes, and other stuff that they developed themselves to tie in with backend systems (eg CRM)<p>Hell, they did more with Oxite before abandoning that than they&#x27;re planning with Ghost.<p>Maybe MS as a company want to get more into node, but that doesn&#x27;t really seem in line with their larger strategy (even though they definitely are starting to embrace OSS more, particularly on the web teams) - so it&#x27;s probably just likely that one team wanted somewhere that they could test out the library they&#x27;ve written.",1379311773

You have to look at the system as a whole.  And it is extremely destructive and inhospitable when you evaluate it objectively and holistically.<p>I know that the popular world-view for internet technologists is very different from that of course.  I saw the Hans Rosling TED talk.  I used to share the same rose-colored worldview.  I also used to believe all of the propaganda put out on television.<p>I now know that the world we live is far more violent and dysfunctional than we are led to believe.  We have very deep structural problems starting with a Social Darwinistic worldview that leads to massive inequality and waste.  I believe that technology is working rather directly against all of those negative legacy factors.<p>And I also believe that technology is currently improving the situation and will continue to do so as things like ultra-local food and energy production aided by nanotechnology become mainstream.  I also think that within about twenty years unaugmented humanity will be obsoleted by advanced, vastly superior AI, and that will eliminate the current severe problems with worldviews and social structures holding back technological advancement.  I am a little worried we might run into World War III before we get those things online though.",1379311511

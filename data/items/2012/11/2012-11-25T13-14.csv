Each of these applications is standalone, hence when a user wishes to change their details, a person in HR must make the changes 3 times. As you can imagine, this becomes quite tedious and leaves room for entry error.<p>I wrote an application using Python and Django that allows the HR staff to enter the details once, and update all applications accordingly (and they love it). I have written it in such a way that with some work, it will be easy for an employee of any company (with granted access) to also setup this software for their system.<p>Do you think it is worth putting the extra effort in to be able to release this to the public, or has this done before and will be pretty redundant?<p>Thanks",1353848500

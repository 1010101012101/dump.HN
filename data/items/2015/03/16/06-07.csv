9210204,comment,9210045,9210060,0,0,NhanH,,,"To expand on this a bit, for better or worse, most of human&#x27;s collective knowledge is still locked up in people head, be it cutting edge researching knowledge, industrial mainstream knowledge, or obscure hobby one. Notice that how in programming, you only got knowledge of the very basic, and then a glimpse of knowledge on the very high end (multiple distributed huge data center etc.). There is a huge swath of missing information for anything in the middle. That&#x27;s partly why experience is relevant: there are certain things you just can&#x27;t know until you meet someone who tell you about it.<p>There are certain attempts to fix the knowledge gap issue, namely Q&A sites, as well as places where people can share their knowledge. But Q&A doesn&#x27;t seem to work for most things beyond the basics: there isn&#x27;t an objective answer, as everything is a trade off, and questions aren&#x27;t as good as a conversation would be for context and everything else. Even for Quora, where the questions and answers can be subjective, there is an implicit requirement that both of them have to be self-contained (otherwise, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense). It&#x27;s evident to see in the &quot;naive&quot; question on Quora: sometimes you can tell the asker knows a bit and wanted to ask for more, but the resulting questions just come out very awkward.<p>And finally, I think that people are more reluctant to just <i>share their knowledge</i> (directed at no one), for a variety of reasons: it&#x27;s actually hard to just write about things - there are a big gap between knowing something, and being able to write it down clearly, we mostly can&#x27;t write a book, but everyone of you will have a thing or two to teach me regardless. It might seem wasteful (who would read this?), or it&#x27;s just simply never come to our mind that&#x27;s the knowledge is valuable - familiarity makes everything seems trivial. Most of those issues would not exists in a small group settings.<p>For a more concrete idea, think of a small but active mailing list, IRC channel, or subreddit, that&#x27;s approximately the desirable result. If you can, make those mainstream, pretty please :-).",1426489053

9210194,comment,9208897,9209582,0,0,kelnos,,,"I was too harsh, and for that I apologize.  I more care about the level of the increases: a landlord can certainly pull in more profit with a modest rent increase that doesn&#x27;t break the tenant&#x27;s bank (and that&#x27;s likely even a higher increase than current rent control laws allow).  The OP&#x27;s rent is about to become over 4x what it once was.  I certainly won&#x27;t deny that the cost of owning a property will tend to go up, but it sounds to me like most of that rent increase will end up being pure profit.<p>I want to be rich someday, too.  But I don&#x27;t want to be rich knowing that I directly made the lives of other people harder in doing so.  I don&#x27;t think wealth and capitalism has to be a zero-sum game; I don&#x27;t believe that for me to become richer, someone else must become poorer.<p>All this is precisely <i>why</i> we don&#x27;t have absolute property ownership rights.  We as a society have collectively agreed that land is a limited, public asset, and we&#x27;re willing to allow people to own it, and receive some benefits from the state, but also have to follow some rules that serve the public&#x27;s interest... like not kicking people to the curb out of greed.  If you own land, then you should know this already: it&#x27;s not &quot;yours&quot; in the absolute sense.  It&#x27;s an investment, to be sure, but your return on that investment can be limited by law in some cases.  This is just one way in how that shakes out.<p><i>I&#x27;m sorry that doesn&#x27;t jive with your political/world outlook, but that doesn&#x27;t make me a bad person.  There are pros and cons to any economic system, but apparently capitalism is not for you.</i><p>I&#x27;m not going to try to define &quot;good person&quot; or &quot;bad person&quot;, but I will say that the idea of evicting someone from their home (and sometimes city) because their landlord sees dollar signs in their eyes is just reprehensible to me.  That doesn&#x27;t put me at odds with capitalism; I think that just makes me human.",1426488668

9210192,comment,9207028,9208334,0,0,gchpaco,,,"I&#x27;m reminded of the discussions about XP when it was newer.  Lotta folks thought XP meant &quot;cowboy away&quot; and then got excited when it invariably didn&#x27;t work--the original folks said &quot;well, look, you&#x27;re not doing the process; you can&#x27;t blame it if you&#x27;re not doing it&quot;.<p>Now the thing is this looks a hell of a lot like a No True Scotsman argument, especially if you&#x27;re only glancing at it in passing.  Yet, boundary setting is a legitimate thing to do; the XP folks had put up their lists of practices, etc.  XP is/was very demanding, very tricky to do; it was an open question for a little while whether it was actually implementable by average organizations.  The interface with the product owner was a particular issue, and is still in Scrum.<p>Put another way, when you say &quot;Scrum says to do X&quot; (say, very few meetings which should go quickly), and someone goes &quot;Scrum sucks because we&#x27;re constantly in meetings explaining why we&#x27;re not getting any work done&quot;, and you say &quot;You&#x27;re not doing Scrum&quot;... you have a point.  Scrum teams are not supposed to be crunching; if the product has to ship by date X, then some of the features won&#x27;t get in, and it&#x27;s the product owner&#x27;s _responsibility_ to say which ones those are.  If the product owner says &quot;I don&#x27;t care these are all mission critical we can&#x27;t discard any of them&quot; then you&#x27;re not doing Scrum, even if you have some highly educated boob with a certificate from some idiot making them a Scrum Ninja or whatever saying that you are!<p>Now, some of the practices are more important than others, and most of these frameworks say &quot;you kinda need to be flexible, but try it first&quot;.  So there are grey areas.  And sometimes (as with XP) the existence proof that it is even possible to do the process is nontrivial.

9210189,comment,9207686,9207686,0,0,lutorm,,,"I&#x27;ve judged at the local school science fair in California, at the Intel ISEF a bunch of years ago, and I was also part of the organization that arranges the national science fair (Utstallningen Unga Forskare) in Sweden. Hence, I think I have some perspective on this topic.<p>The American science fairs are a completely different thing from what we did in Sweden. First, the Swedish one is strictly for 17-19 year olds. But more importantly, the Swedish one is not a competition -- the whole idea is that you do this voluntarily, because you have some project you are excited about, and because you get feedback about your project from real scientists.<p>What purpose does it serve to make it a competition? Isn&#x27;t the idea to encourage the idea that science and engineering is fun and interesting? Making it a competition just serves to accentuate the issues mentioned in this article: giving an extreme advantage to kids who have access to professional equipment and personal mentoring.<p>And the whole thing about doing &quot;original science&quot; is ludicrous, especially when it&#x27;s applied to middle school kids. What matters is whether the outcome is known <i>to the student</i>, not to the world. Kids engage in authentic inquiry every day, and whether the topic is &quot;original science&quot; or not matters not one bit.<p>If the choice is between the kid who investigated how different rubber bands shoot rocks of different sizes, but did it by his or herself vs. the one who was hand held through some fancy-sounding project at their parents lab, my choice will go to the former every time.<p>And yes, maybe there are super prodigies out there who actually mastered a research field enough to not only be able to do cutting edge research but also to know enough  to pick a topic that is as high school students. I&#x27;m not worried about those kids, they don&#x27;t need encouragement.",1426488551

9210151,comment,9208858,9208858,0,0,meesterdude,,,"I was laid off from my job a few years ago (network monitoring) and decided I would use the unemployment to change careers. Been a rails dev for 3+ years now, so I will convey what worked for me.<p>The requirements for a full stack rails developer are not what i would consider low. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re unreasonable, but there&#x27;s a lot involved.<p>Sorry, this devolved into general &quot;new dev&quot; advice / what you need to learn; hope its helpful.<p>1. Watch railscasts - try to watch all of them. Make it your new TV show. You don&#x27;t need to &quot;get&quot; everything, you just need exposure/familiarity.<p>2. Have ideas and ideas of how to build them.<p>3. Build things full stack - such as one of your ideas. be someone that gets things done. this also means that you&#x27;ll face problems (like search, caching, uptime) that you&#x27;ll have to solve in your side projects, that will give you experience to use professionally.<p>4. Deploy to a server via capistrano. You should also know how how to do heroku, but you&#x27;ll be more useful if you can setup and deploy to a live server.<p>5. Understand testing; either test_unit or rspec - it depends on you which you prefer. familiarity with both isnt a bad idea either. You should develop a sense of testing philosophy - not everything has the same testing priority. But you absolutely should know how to test in unit and functional full-stack - testing is a big deal in ruby/rails.<p>6. watch the &quot;is TDD dead?&quot; talks with DHH, martin fowler, and kent beck.<p>7. learn git & github. I recommend &quot;git essentials training&quot; on lynda.com<p>8. dig into ruby - after you know the basics, &quot;the well grounded rubyist&quot; by david black is a great read, and gives you insight into the nuances of ruby.<p>9. &quot;design patterns in ruby&quot; by obie fernandez is good - i&#x27;d save for after #8 at the least, it&#x27;s fairly high level and you certainly won&#x27;t need it in the beginning - more a mid-level book.<p>10. ruby tapas is great for little nuggets of ruby that can be insightful to know.<p>10. Sandi metz is wicked smart - any of her talks online or books are worth checking out.<p>11. checkout jobs on sites like weworkremotely.com and see what kinda stack people roll with to gauge what you need to know.<p>12. learn an editor, like sublime or rubymine or whatever floats your boat. For sublime, i recommend &quot;perfect workflow in sublime text 2&quot; on tuts+. you don&#x27;t need to be a master, but there are little tricks you&#x27;ll learn that can help you be more efficient.<p>13. stay humble and curious. It is far too easy for a developer to think they are smart and write amazing code and that they don&#x27;t need to do or use X because they know better. I speak both of my own experiences, and what I witness from others.<p>14. Embrace change. How we build web apps is evolving and you should try to stay with the times. How rails 2.x got things done is different from how rails 4 does things.<p>15. Be conservative. This is somewhat contrary to #14, but that&#x27;s because there is a balance to be struck. Neither as an extreme is healthy. You should be reaching for pre-existing design patterns or whats built into rails, before reinventing the wheel, or pulling in a gem. If you do, have a good reason.",1426487393

A big part of whether or not someone is an asshole is about intent.<p><i>What if the landlord wants somewhere for their aging grandmother to live so they can care for her? Would that still make them an asshole? I suspect you&#x27;ll say yes, because they&#x27;re looking to push someone out of their home.</i><p>The Ellis Act provides for landlords who want to take a property off the rental market, so this sort of thing actually <i>is</i> explicitly allowed by law.  I think this is a tough thing, because yes, you are pushing someone out of a home, but I think it&#x27;s a good balance of property ownership rights vs. the public good, as you&#x27;re saying you want to do something completely different with the property, rather than just finding a way to do the exact same thing but line your pockets more.<p><i>Maybe the tenant has caused so many headaches that it&#x27;s not worth putting up with them for the profit anymore.</i><p>The problem with this sort of reasoning is that it&#x27;s subjective.  A landlord could decide that a tenant is a &quot;headache&quot; because the plumbing in the building is terrible and the toilet keeps flooding the bathroom for no reason, and the tenant has decided to withhold a portion of rent until it&#x27;s fixed.  Should the landlord be allowed to evict the tenant because of that?  I&#x27;d say no.  But if the &quot;headache&quot; is that the tenant is constantly violating quiet-time rules and waking people up, then maybe repeated behavior of that sort should be grounds for eviction.<p>For this sort of thing I&#x27;d want the law to stay out of it.  A signed lease is a contract between landlord and tenant; enumerate the &quot;headaches&quot; that will lead to eviction.  Of course there&#x27;s room for interpretation, but let the lawyers and courts deal with that.<p><i>OK. Then what is it? What&#x27;s your happy medium, where you are getting money from someone, providing something in exchange, and making a profit without enriching yourself at their expense?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think the exact number is all that important, but there&#x27;s likely a range of acceptable values for different landlords, properties, and tenants.  My position is that a 10x or even 1x increase is crazy and throws the public interest out the window.<p>When it comes to housing, people tend to buy/rent as much as they think they can afford (and sometimes more).  You can argue that this is foolish (and I&#x27;d agree!), but that&#x27;s the reality of the situation.  Even doubling someone&#x27;s rent would likely be catastrophic for their finances.  The idea that landowners should be allowed to extract every bit of profit possible out of land -- a public, limited good -- no matter what the consequences, is absolutely reprehensible to me.",1426486558

10708782,comment,10707569,10707946,0,0,jamiesonbecker,,,"Redis is actually a very reliable engine to store data, as long as you keep in mind its design principles. (the Aphyr post is great with that). The replication and cluster modes can add additional complexity (but of course mysql master-slave or master-master have their own risks and complexity as well.)<p>Just comparing a single box vs single box.. this is about 3,333 queries per second if I understand the metric used (200k req per minute). A Redis instance (non-sharded) can handle 50 times that in a single thread, while maintaining sub-ms latency.<p>Just comparing the two: for this volume of data, and given the low queries per second, I completely agree that MySQL is a better choice since Redis wouldn&#x27;t scale for cost (of RAM -- it would be silly to pay for that RAM if SSD or spinning disk can handle the load.)<p>Redis is really nice when used in conjunction with other servers. At Userify (SSH key management for cloud instances), we used to function with a purely MySQL environment, but MySQL couldn&#x27;t keep up with our requirements (tens of thousands of qps) on low-end hardware for mostly small bits of data. We converted the whole thing to Redis + S3 and are scaling very smoothly, even though we actually encrypt and gzip data before writing to Redis (and we actually write-through to S3, which is mostly invisible except for sequentially pipelined operations). There are circumstances where we could have the lost-write problem, but they are rare in practice and would basically be the same effect as rolling-back a commit.<p>If I was going to scale the WiX model higher, I&#x27;d probably keep MySQL for the blob data (or use S3) and use Redis for lookups, or pursue other paths to keep MySQL in place (or perhaps pgsql). But don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broke. ;)<p>And, of course, there is still a very long way you can go to take MySQL (or Postgres) to insane heights (just ask Facebook), including NDB/MySQL Cluster, innovative caching solutions with Redis front-ending MySQL (the way you used to do with Memcached), maxscale, or additional sharding.<p>In other words, your design works and works well, and shows the power of MySQL (or especially Postgresql) as a general purpose data store. I really agree that you should always start on the datastore that you think you can get up and running with quickly and easily<i>, and focus on optimization later, because optimization is always possible later within any complex system.<p></i> although Redis is just a dream to work with -- unlike some other nosql solutions..",1449719899

It was still too early for 64bit to really provide any benefit and operating system support was weak. At least people I remember saw it for what it was- marketing. It happens that in the long term it ended up being the way to go, but at the time the Athlon64&#x27;s were coming around there wasn&#x27;t much point (for consumers at least). By the time 64bit came of age Intel had already buried AMD by a combination of foul play and legitimate innovation.<p>IMO AMD could compete because the manufacturing and design processes were still accessible enough that they could still produce chips with competitive performance without the massive amount of capital Intel invests in new designs today due simply to diminishing returns in processor performance. Nowadays the difficulty of new processes means that very very few foundries are capable of using the latest fabrication processes and Intel has a stranglehold on them. It&#x27;s harder for AMD to play catch-up, because there is less slack for them to work with using the next-best-thing. Nowadays, all the money AMD could spend on innovating with genuinely new technology is instead spent trying to keep up just keep up, whereas before they had more breathing room.<p>There&#x27;s a comparison to draw with the engine wars in Formula 1 in the 90s. The sport was in major trouble financially, because teams were spending gigantic sums of money chasing small gains in engine performance on the extreme tail end of diminishing returns. The small teams were imploding trying to keep up because while the performance delta might have only been a few horsepower between the big and small teams, those few extra horsepower had a big impact on how competitive you were. And engine development is astronomically expensive on the far side of the returns curve, so additionally even the big teams were outspending themselves trying to keep up with each other before they implemented rules changes to limit engine development.",1449719883

OK, that means that systemd developers are exposed to a bunch of different components, and work with them frequently.  So, they find a pain-point, and they think to themselves &quot;I could improve this.&quot;  And, because they are competent developers, and it&#x27;s free/open-source, they do.  Sure, the reason the found a pain-point, and chose to contribute is because of their work systemd, but that contribution isn&#x27;t in-scope for systemd, isn&#x27;t associated with systemd.  It&#x27;s just them being good citizens and improving the ecosystem.<p>Now, remember that a significant portion of the systemd developers are also kernel developers, and have been since before systemd existed.  So it&#x27;s not unlikely that because of systemd, they see a way that they think the kernel could be improved.  And they&#x27;re contributing to the kernel anyway, so why not?<p>That said, many people object to the kind of design decisions made in systemd, and don&#x27;t like that that those kind of decisions are spreading to the rest of the ecosystem.  This isn&#x27;t systemd taking over, this is the fact that certain prolific individuals, who are systemd developers, are also contributing to other projects; naturally making the same kind of decisions.",1449719656

The moral framework of the West allows the most powerful nations on Earth to escalate to untold levels of violence over sporadic attacks that quite unfortunately kill dozens of people; then they retaliate destabilizing entire countries, uprooting the lives of millions, and causing thousands and thousands of direct casualties from their ordnance.<p>The point is that it&#x27;s a massive, massive joke for anyone to distinguish themself from this group of people who engage in &#x27;intellectually malformed pseudo-activism&#x27; because there are no apolitical stances and being complicit members of societies that shape the world through incredible violence is no different a hypocritical perversion of morality as anyone who rustles your jimmies on the fucking Internet.",1449718921

10708601,comment,10699149,10699149,0,0,nikdaheratik,,,"I think the author has set an impossible task for the article: trying to sell Java without giving any specific use cases. Generalities don&#x27;t cut it, especially if you&#x27;ve already invested time learning how to do something in Python, which isn&#x27;t perfect, but can match the JVM in the areas that it does excel at (e.g. problems that need NumPy or Django).<p>Java is irritatingly pedantic about sticking to its idea of how OOP should work. It has that design by committee feel to it that enforces some idioms that please no one (like pushing object Factories). If you need to get a prototype out or want something that can let you automate a task quickly with little BS, you don&#x27;t want Java.<p>Java is good for enterprise developers as it tends to reign alot of the cowboy tendencies of some programmers and helps to force everyone on the project to use the same clearly defined, well planned (and less elegant) APIs and other systems. And the JVM keeps you from being tied into some specific hardware that may go away in the future.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between a toolkit to design and build a cool building, like the Space needle, or you need to coordinate a huge number of contractors because you&#x27;re building the Big Dig or Chunnel.",1449716748

Hamlet finds himself caught up in a moral drama — Did his uncle murder his father? Did his mother knowingly condone the act or is just wrong to marry her husband&#x27;s brother? Is his love interest betraying him by reporting on his behaviour? etc, etc. Hamlet eventually determines he will endeavour to step outside it, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t succeed and gets drawn back in, resulting in more violence and his own death.<p>The best answer to moral drama is often to try to rise above it, not by ignoring it but by addressing it from a higher moral level. But that higher level has to be real and not faked and there&#x27;s the great challenge.",1449716629

Shitty Listings helped us find an audience in the small-time real estate investment community for instance [0]. The advice I&#x27;d give from our experience with these mini-launches is to make sure they tie in well with the larger product and make sure not to let these traffic spikes mask underlying problems with retention in your main business. Especially when you&#x27;re small, it&#x27;s easy for the whole team to get distracted by shiny launches and getting signups when the real growth opportunities are usually &quot;boring&quot; stuff like tweaking transactional emails.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.shittylistings.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shittylistings.com</a>",1449716594

10708582,comment,10707834,10708282,0,0,LightMachine,,,"Of course I can, much faster. Maybe you do not see how high level the λ-calculus is... take a look on the Caramel syntax. I can translate line-by-line any Haskell program to Caramel. The λ-calculus, when given a decent syntax, is just Haskell without the types (but still has algebraic data structures identically, just no annotations). And I can be much more  productive in Haskell than in Scheme, I think that goes without saying.<p>About the performance of the program itself, yes, λcalculus is faster than Scheme, by an order of magnitude, sometimes. For one, algorithms on church-encoded lists fuse by reduction, which means that the code below, in Caramel:<p><pre><code>    map f (filter cond (zipWith (+) (map f a) (map f b)))\n</code></pre>\nfuses to a single tight loop - i.e., it iterates through the lists `a` and `b` only once, and returns the result after that, creating no intermediate structure. Scheme would create 4 intermediate structures on this case. Since it is already 2~3x slower than the λ-calculus (running on GHC), that&#x27;d make it an order of magnitude slower in that case.",1449716516

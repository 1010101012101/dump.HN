The Apple A6 processor is Apple's first custom-designed processor.""</i><p>Presumably there is some strain in relations between Apple and Samsung, given that they compete in the mobile device market, and the lawsuit over copying designs.<p>Would Apple be worried that Samsung would be able to glean trade secrets from their custom design of the A6? Would the information provided to Samsung for manufacture of the chip pose this kind of risk? Or would be less like handing off source code, and more like handing off a compiled binary?",1348610388

They were more then happy to pay for the map data but having 3rd party location ads were a non-starter.<p>So yes Google will say no to cash for the rights to their map data (though maybe not a ""truck load"") if they don't think the deal supports their business.   Google's not in the maps business - they're in the ads business. I can very much see Google sticking their heels in the ground on a few ""minor"" points until Apple walked away.",1348610264
4572906,comment,4572427,4572832,3,0,Titanous,,,"There are two important pieces to your Tent identity.<p>1: Your Entity (this is the url you're referring to. I could be <a href=""https://jonathan.tent.is"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jonathan.tent.is</a> and then change to <a href=""https://titanous.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://titanous.com</a>). Think of entities like a name. You can change it but you really want to think carefully first. Other Tent servers know you by your entity. If all you told someone was your entity (<a href=""https://spindritf.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spindritf.net</a>) their Tent server would contact the URL where you have saved information about your Tent server. It's all you need to find out someone's Tent information or start following them, like a username. When you change your entity, your server sends out a post to all your followers and lets them know about a profile update with a new entity URL so they can update their records.<p>2: Your ""canonical tent URLs"" (the addresses of the servers where you can be reached). These are literally like your address. You can have multiple addresses and move any time you want. Again, your server will simply send a post to your friends letting them know you're moving and where to reach you. In both of these cases you probably want to give other servers some time to update their records before moving just in case.<p>There are a few edge cases worth mentioning. This system does not <i>actually</i> depend on DNS, but most users will. For example, instead of <a href=""https://titanous.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://titanous.com</a> I could theoretically list an IP address instead or a tor hidden service.",1348610227

4572899,comment,4570421,4572607,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Based on three things:<p>1) Various facts with regard to AMaps quality (fit and finish) vs GMaps quality. Knowledge of licensing terms [1] and the fact that 2012 is 5 years after 2007 (introduction of the iPhone [2]).<p>2) Interviews with Google executives over the various Android lawsuits and tweets from Andy Rubin amongst others.<p>3) The ""make money now"" mantra that has swept through Google cancelling dozens of projects and creating pricing models for the ones that remain (AppEngine, Maps, Etc.)<p>So like any good investigator one looks at what is known, and what is not known, and trys to come up with a series of steps that would lead to the observed outcome (in this case crappy maps on the iPhone). You can classify those in the range from ""more likely"" to ""less likely"".<p>So for example a theory that ""Google Maps are no longer on the iPhone because Apple forgot to renew their license."" would seem improbable, putting together something as complex as the iPhone doesn't allow for 'forgetting' such things. A theory that ""Apple couldn't get a license"" also fails the sniff test as Google clearly licenses things to folks all the time, they have a revenue model for that and as a publicly traded company they generally don't ""not take revenue"" when its possible to do so effectively. So if you get to the point in your reasoning that Apple could get a license if they wanted to, and Google could give them that license if they wanted to. Then you are left looking at a failed negotiation. I've participated in both successful and unsuccessful negotiations like these, its like many things where the details or scale may be different but the basic steps share a lot of similarities.<p>That leaves us speculating on how the negotiations failed.<p>Given how badly the AMaps product (as shipped) is in comparison to the GMaps product, clearly Google was in a fairly strong negotiating position. Given Apple's free cash flow and assets (remember they made more profit last quarter than Google made in all revenue) they clearly could afford to pay a pretty arbitrary price. The simplest answer (which for me makes it the most likely) is that Apple was unwilling to meet the terms Google set for licensing.<p>So you (Tichy) have posed variations on this question to a number of people on a number of threads here but I've yet to see any reasoning you might have for why you <i>don't</i> believe this is the case. I realize it is implied by the snark but not actually expressed as a dissenting opinion. I'd love to hear your reasoning on it if you are free to share it. I note in a sister comment you mention 'revoke' the license, I don't think Google did any such thing, I believe the license <i>expired</i> and it was up for renewal, it was the renewal that failed to materialize.<p>[1] ""Our license to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended, customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be on the App Store,"" explains Apple in a brief statement to The Verge. -- <a href=""http://www.maclife.com/article/news/apple_ios_youtube_license_over_google_offer_its_own_app_ios_6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maclife.com/article/news/apple_ios_youtube_licens...</a><p>[2] ""iPhone also includes Google Maps, featuring Googles groundbreaking maps service and iPhones amazing maps application, offering the best maps experience by far on any pocket device.

4572855,comment,4570790,4570790,11,0,Lazare,,,"MongoDB is really easy to get started with.  It's easy to install on a VM, and it's easy to try it out on Heroku.  There's drivers for a bunch of languages, and its API works in a way that fits well with the way programmers already think.  It dispenses with pretty much everything that makes getting started with a new database hard (schemas, new syntax, unfamiliar concepts, needing to edit server configs).<p>MongoDB ""just works"" out of the box for testing and development.  It's practically the perfect database for any testing and development work.  And their marketing documentation tells you that it'll just work in production and will scale really well.  That makes a <i>lot</i> of people try MongoDB, and they're mostly very happy with it.<p>...the problems arise later.  Because while MongoDB lives up to the hype for testing and development, it doesn't completely live up to the hype for production uses.  It doesn't always scale that well.  It isn't always as durable as you might hope.  Performance isn't always very good.  For some use cases, the default settings aren't appropriate; for other use cases the database design itself isn't appropriate.  Backups and replication aren't quite as easy as you'd hope.<p>In short, the problem comes because MongoDB is as good or better than, say, Postgres or Riak during development in basically every way, but it's only better than Postgres or Riak in a few specialized ways during production.<p>Example:  Riak basically won't work at all in a multi-tenant setup.  Two competing services will provide you with a free development MongoDB instance on Heroku, but nothing of the kind exists for Riak; you basically need to roll your own cluster.  That makes MongoDB really easy for someone thinking ""hey, I wonder if Mongo would work for this proof of concept I'm working on"" (hint:  it will).  Of course, MongoDB replication and scaling is honestly mediocre, while Riak's is basically magic.  This makes Riak a better choice for someone who needs to scale a cluster of database servers - but you only find out that sort of thing first-hand during production.  At which point, you make an angry blog post that hits Hacker News.  And while plenty of people never run into MongoDBs weak areas, they never post anything that hits the Hacker News frontpage.  :)<p>TL;DR:  A lot of people hate MongoDB because it's amazingly easy to get started with, but harder later on, and they then feel betrayed.  Other databases have smoother learning curves.",1348609518

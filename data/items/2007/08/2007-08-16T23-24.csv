43269,comment,43118,43187,0,0,mangodrunk,,,">news interesting to hackers generally.  <p>Obviously hackers have found this interesting, but I agree it is on the border of being irrelevant. I think it is useful to use PG's rule of thumb that if it's covered on TV news then it's off topic which I think this is an exception to.  <p>I like this new direction that yc is taking, the site was rather boring to me before which I barely frequented until I saw that it changed on reddit.  <p>I shouldn't come here to often because each time I read something by PG I feel like quitting my job and starting a company.",1187308210

43265,comment,43231,43231,0,0,nickb,,,"Where's the data?! Just calling Pareto's rule on every new phenomena does not work. Asking us to agree or disagree on something that none of us really has any data on is beyond pointless and actually harmful.<p>For instance, Yahoo data with Flickr shows that less than 10% of people actually contribute content. So Pareto's rule does not apply there. But only Facebook knows how it works with their users. You can't just blindly apply these ""laws"" to various user groups and expect them to be even half true.",1187307602

43263,comment,43074,43074,0,0,mangodrunk,,,">churn out meaningless solutions to irrelevant problems.  <p>That can be said of most of the advancements in math, science, and computer science. At a time, there was no need for zero, calendars, calculus, square root of negative one, etc. What the author calls irrelevant today will be tomorrow's great achievement. Most of Turing's work was irrelevant at the time, other than his work on cryptography.   <p>I don't think it is proper for great minds to worry about trivial things like enterprise Java code or what it takes to build a social networking website. This stuff is simple, that's why we can outsource it to other countries that don't have the resources to invest in the future developments that are needed for progress.  <p>Also, the whole article is based on the author's opinions, which isn't bad for that fact (actually the article was entertaining to say the least), but they aren't backed by something in any form.",1187307396

And the micromanagement.  By the end of the day it's mentally draining.<p>At school, nobody cares whether you do anything.  And when you do something, it's by your own decision.  I mean, I know you <i>decide</i> to do something at work, but.. It's hard to put into specific words.  School lays all its expectations out in front of you; work shoves them down your throat.",1187306257

Then when I come home I immediately work on that feature, telling myself ""When it's done I can take a break"".  Then I never take a break because I get so involved.  <p>It's so satisfying watching a project come together and become polished and pretty that once I start polishing, I don't want to stop.

It&#x27;s not really the idea that statistics will influence content as much as it is about who and how it will influence it.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; (the source books for &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;), like a lot of people, for years. That is, I&#x27;ve been reading a book enjoyably for a couple of months and then waiting 5 years for the next one. It&#x27;s an incredibly intricate and big story spanning a lot of character and geography. It&#x27;s very big. The author, is obviously a special talent with incredible story telling ability and character perspectives. The talent for getting into characters&#x27; heads makes me think he must be a very emotionally invested artist.<p>Anyway, among all the characters, story, best seller pressure, TV show, and such writing the books takes a long time. He&#x27;s got a Ford Prefect like relationship with deadlines.<p>Now.. in my (naive) mind, that&#x27;s as it should be. A chaotic, burdensome process that (at the end, sometimes) produces art.<p>TV shows and films are the art of our times. This is not a statement about quality, just about the reach, influence and such. The people who make films are famous and admired. Everyone gets the references and allusions. Almost everyone indulges in it, grows up with it. A lot of people here probably got my Douglas Adams reference, but probably fewer than would have gotten a reference to &quot;Morpheus,&quot; even in this biased crowd.<p>But, movies and television shows are made by big groups of people, money, risk-capital, adult supervision.  I&#x27;m OK with statistical information about pace, plot or whatnot eventually permeating through the arts. That probably makes the arts better. I dislike the idea of it being used as a mallet in the proverbial committee designing the thing.<p>I like sausage. I prefer sausage to be made in a nice way. If you insist on both making it in a way I don&#x27;t want to see and constantly reminding me that I should not look into how it is made… I&#x27;ll have some beef stew instead.",1443099501

Third party libraries often have type definitions in the DefinityTyped collection.<p>That just leaves constructs that work in JavaScript, but which can&#x27;t be type checked in TypeScript.

I mean, if I flip a coin and heads comes up, it&#x27;s not surprising that tails is down.  The head is connected to the tail, so I can&#x27;t have both coming up at the same time.  Imagine that there are inhabitants of a torus world with the coin at one point.  It&#x27;s spinning there.  Alice stays to watch the spinning coin and Bob wanders along the torus in the opposite direction.  Eventually he sees a spinning coin too.  It can&#x27;t be the same coin, because he&#x27;s walked a <i>long</i> way in the opposite direction.  So he watches the coin.  Eventually it stops spinning.  Alice sees heads and Bob sees tails.  No matter how often they do this, it works out opposite.  It&#x27;s not that one side of the coin is communicating to the other side of the coin at the other &quot;end&quot; of the torus.  It&#x27;s just that there is no other way for it to work out.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that it actually works this way, I&#x27;m just giveng my drunken monkey interpretation of how particles could exhibit this behaviour without many worlds ;-)",1443098777

When I wrote the article, Vainglory wasn&#x27;t released yet. I&#x27;ve played a fair amount of Vainglory and they did indeed crack the code for a mobile MOBA. The Halcyon Fold map from Vainglory is a derivative of Twisted Treeline which offers enough strategic depth to be played at the competitive level, unlike Zynga&#x27;s Solstice Arena. This, and the fluidity of the game sets it apart from the others imo. I still believe Super Evil Megacorp would have been better served with a more tongue-in-cheek visual style / IP if they want to address the entirety of the iPad install-base.

Then it hunts prey, plays with it, possibly eats it. Repeat.<p>I believe the human (at least male human) version of this algorithm is roughly: sleep when tired, otherwise absent some imminent threat (see below) work on various plans directed toward having sex in the future, otherwise go figure out the world. Imminent threats (hunger, leaking roof, dangerous predators, &quot;sprint&quot; deadlines...) trigger immediate and focused activity.<p>I think this explains procrastination and pretty much everything else: doing things like the VPTree implementation doesn&#x27;t rise to the level of dealing with an imminent threat (unless someone needs to ship it in a product tomorrow), and it doesn&#x27;t fall into the category of &quot;figure out the world&quot; because you already know how said trees work and are used well enough.

A NaN times / divided by / added to / subtracted from anything is a NaN, that means that if you have a complex formula, if you throw a NaN in there anyway you get back a NaN. Maybe works the exact same way but with all functions not just arithmetic operators.

And of course not everyone values brevity and expressiveness, but when done right it makes code more readable not less, and Monads done right facilitate that.<p>Maybe&#x27;s toxicity is just an example of pretty much any &quot;magic&quot; you can build into a Monad. You could for example have a Future Monad that will handle asynchronous control flow for you.<p>As a side matter, it&#x27;s not just working around Haskell&#x27;s strict type system that make Monads a good fit for IO, but also Haskell&#x27;s non-strict execution.. monads help things happen in the right order which is crucial for IO.

Just like Guido&#x27;s &quot;there is one way, and its the right way&quot; mentality carried over from the core Python base, you see that same mentality it in Django itself. Sure, if you end up fighting too much against templates you can swap in jinja2, or an ORM in goes SQLAlchemy, but out of the box you have a pretty decent stack ready to use. It&#x27;s the same reason why I like ASP.NET C# MVC. At this point, with all the NuGet packages, I can swap in any component I want basically, if I find the stock MS components lacking. Entity Framework not meeting my business needs? In goes NHibernate or Glass.Mapper.<p>I&#x27;m going to get a lot of hell for this since this is startup-land-latest-and-greatest-just-graduated-from-Stanford territory, but WebSphere and J2EE really got everything down for a god damn reliable infrastructure, REST or WSDL compatible, authentication/authorization via any provider you want ranging from Novell Netware to LDAP or AD, caching can be thrown in _every level_, if an appserver goes down, another node picks up the abandoned client sessions, you&#x27;re getting high availability at just an absolutely remarkable level. Hate on maven (I&#x27;ve been down in the trenches with Scons and the GNU autotools set, you can get far worse) all you want but the ability to freeze and clone all of your dependencies into a local .m2 repository allows you to be 100% confident if an upgrade breaks functionality, regress & problem solved. I&#x27;m not even a J2EE advocate, more of a &quot;please just work, I don&#x27;t have the mental capacity to learn 60 packages + 15 workaround shims until all browsers are ES6 compatible.<p>I really like a lot of the options of node out there. Tons of packages are really useful and innovative (as opposed to Yet-another-templating-system). There are quite a few interactive projects that the v8 platform lends itself to, especially with socket.io, a lot more flexibility that didn&#x27;t exist before. But between ReactJS, Flow, JSX (which confuses me even more when I context shift because I write C# with TypeScript), and 50 other packages out there, I&#x27;m completely lost.<p>From a managerial perspective, its going to be hell to maintain those projects 3 years down the line when all of your 22 year old engineers have moved onto their own startups/friends startups/across the country because their long-time-partner got into Harvard med/etc. You&#x27;ll be left searching for someone with expertise in Jade, Express, Node, Mongoose, Nginx, Socket.io, JSX, [insert 10 other modules which will become critical to your architecture as time goes on]. It&#x27;s great for the engineer who lands inherits that project on a 1099 capacity because they&#x27;ll be able to bill whatever they want, but absolutely terrible in terms of long-term maintainability (and yes, I realize technical debt is often a &quot;bond-offering&quot; (heh) worth making in exchange for a faster MVP in some cases).",1443096607

I use the automated investing tools and don&#x27;t focus at all on the number of defaults, etc. Just let the algorithm work for you. Realize that you are basically lending money in unsecured loans, so I wouldn&#x27;t let this become a huge part of your overall assets. I might go up a bit higher to like 5% of total net worth. I like that LendingClub returns are not too strongly correlated with the S&P 500.<p>I would not even bother starting without $5K or so. Since the minimum investment is $25, you need a large number of loans to offset any harm a few defaults can cause.<p>One word of warning: HN folks might have a tendency to get too geeky with the hands-on tuning, creating their own special lending rules to optimize returns. I would say don&#x27;t bother. You are better off writing code for money and investing what you make.",1443096075

What you&#x27;re missing is that the harm in both cases described in my argument are to the SAME people (blacks), at the same era.<p>So, to adjust your examples, it&#x27;s like your parents saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t complain about something&quot; because there was something far more serious going on at your househould (e.g. you shouldn&#x27;t complaint about not getting an iPhone for Xmas, because your father was just fired from his job&quot;.<p>Or that we shouldn&#x27;t complain about smog in the air in LA when there&#x27;s a tsunami of radioactive waste coming down Santa Monica. We should focus on solving THAT first.<p>><i>Your statement is that it&#x27;s to &quot;better focus on its really bad characterstics&quot; That&#x27;s not correct. The focus is on how to improve things. If the video were all about what the KKK did in 1965 then what am I supposed to do about that? Sit here and feel guilty about things that happened before I was born?</i><p>If the focus is on how to improve things (to which I agree) then we should try to improve things that really make a difference. As developers we know that from profiling and Amdahl&#x27;s law.<p>Fixing (or fixating on) the film issue wouldn&#x27;t make an iota of a difference for blacks. Exposing (no pun intended) the problems with seggregation and Jim Crow laws at the same era, would make much more difference.<p>And its the same when we&#x27;re talking about history. At best the article is a curiosity: &quot;back when they routinely lynched blacks and they couldn&#x27;t even get a room at a hotel or eat in a restaurant with whites, film wasn&#x27;t really tailored to their skin tone either&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s nice to know when you have exhausted the other historical issues with racism.

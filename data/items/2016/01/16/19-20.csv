I could also see charging many of the mortgage officers with fraud for falsifying related documents.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that the appraisers are doing any criminal activity. I read this:\n&quot;In the lawsuit, the couples claim prospective home buyers were presented with false or misleading data on previously sold homes in order to justify higher asking prices on new purchases.&quot;<p>If that&#x27;s all they were doing, that&#x27;s not really fraud. HUD should be encouraged to run its own appraisal process on 1% of the received appraisals in order to refine its process.<p>It&#x27;s harder to charge the managers in charge of the officers with fraud: They could easily have taken steps to ensure that they weren&#x27;t aware of any specific fraud on any specific application, even if they generally knew what was going on. I&#x27;m sure the prosecutors could find a way, though.<p>However, it ceases to be fraud for anyone except for the companies immediately processing the mortgage: If they sold the note to a bank, parent company, or to investors, that bank or investor should be off the hook. So I don&#x27;t yet see any crimes for the people who profited the most(the banks who outsourced mortgage processing to smaller companies).",1452973379

The scale and impact of fraud in US financial markets is far greater.<p>It&#x27;s hard to know what laws were clearly broken when there have been very few prosecutions.<p>Bill Black, former regulator and litigator during the S&L crisis:<p>> The savings and loan debacle was one-seventieth the size of the current crisis, both in terms of losses and the amount of fraud. In that crisis, the savings and loan regulators made over 30,000 criminal referrals, and this produced over 1,000 felony convictions in cases designated as “major” by the Department of Justice. But even that understates the degree of prioritization, because we, the regulators, worked very closely with the FBI and the Justice Department to create a list of the top 100 — the 100 worst fraud schemes. They involved roughly 300 savings and loans and 600 individuals, and virtually all of those people were prosecuted. We had a 90 percent conviction rate, which is the greatest success against elite white-collar crime (in terms of prosecution) in history.<p>> In the current crisis, that same agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was supposed to regulate, among others, Countrywide, Washington Mutual and IndyMac — which collectively made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent mortgage loans — made zero criminal referrals. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks, made zero criminal referrals. The Federal Reserve appears to have made zero criminal referrals; it made three about discrimination. And the FDIC was smart enough to refuse to answer the question, but nobody thinks they made any material number of criminal referrals [either].<p><a href=""http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/17/hundreds-of-wall-street-execs-went-to-prison-during-the-last-fraud-fueled-bank-crisis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/17/hundreds-of-wall-street-exe...</a>",1452971434

It&#x27;s great.  The languages are getting easier and more powerful.  I think the world will soon just have 2 groups of people - people who program or make things, and people who don&#x27;t.<p>In short, programming is a great career to start. You don&#x27;t have to be an amazing programmer to appreciate it&#x27;s beauty and value.  Yes, it may be stressful, hey, even jobs at Starbucks or the Amazon warehouse get stressful - if you work at (any job) loser companies, you also lose your job easily when the bossmen screw up.

In fact, the whole post is an argument about ways to improve average traffic speeds.<p>He basically advocates estimating how fast traffic is really going, and going at that speed. Instead of reaching a bottleneck quickly, you should slow down appropriately in advance so that you never have to actually stop. Note that you (and the people behind you) still get through the bottleneck at the same speed, so there is no cost to you (or them), just less braking and accelerating.<p>For what it's worth, some freeway entrances near me (Melbourne, Australia) have traffic lights which rate-limit entry onto the freeway in peak hours. This is exactly the same as what this author is trying to do; by rate-limiting cars at entry, they're not actually slowing them down, since it increases average on-freeway speeds.",1282567589

It found a sentence fragment at the end of Moby Dick within 8ms, 7 times slower than Boyer-Moore. But most of us aren't searching Moby Dick, but rather a HTTP header, some user input, or a paragraph of a document. Even long-winded users won't write Moby Dick into your <textarea>. Most languages and libraries use brute force for this reason - initializing and using Boyer-Moore may be slower than brute-forcing the text. Sometimes ""practically nothing"" is just a brute-force search.<p>But Boyer-Moore is the perfect choice for Grep! The likely inputs on Unix are all huge: log files, entire directory trees, output pipes from loud programs, etc. The cost of initializing a small skip table is overwhelmed by the cost of I/O and the potential volume of text. It's not surprising that they've gone to some lengths to optimize the core inner loops and the I/O in that context.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.jakevoytko.com/blog/2007/12/11/fun-with-string-searching/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jakevoytko.com/blog/2007/12/11/fun-with-string-se...</a> I've declared bankruptcy on broken TeX and code examples...

In France, (where I live), we mostly (maybe 99% ?) have manual transmissions. Have you ever experimented a traffic jam with a manual trans. car ? You have to switch gears every 10 seconds and it's very very very annoying.<p>I'm telling you that, because as a frequent driver (well, today I drive a bike but still) in Paris, and kind of very observant, I clearly see that most people are not doing what these drivers do in this experiment. Most of the time, everybody will let a huge space between the car behind them in order to avoid changing the gears too frequently.<p>On the contrary, on automatic cars (I had one and drove another for 6 months in Canada), that's easier to go & stop & go & stop & go & stop, etc...<p>Not sure if it's related, but I think it is, in a small proportion.<p>edit: my english",1282566322

Let's face it everything alive today on this earth during this very second in which you have read these words will die. I am an atheist to the core and I will remain an atheist to the core. I don't think that there are any angels, or heaven or some kind of hell out there. I know that the only thing out there is emptiness. There is no doubt about it, and that's the beauty of it.<p>By accepting the fact that nothing truly ever lasts we can prepare ourselves for peace. It's a really twisted concept that I can't explain in words, but whenever you see the truth that happiness is not just another shot away then you don't crave for things. You don't seek to replace the pain with something else. All you do is focus on just being and that opens the doors for everything else. You learn to love and create for the sake of doing just that. You see beyond yourself and you actually care about other people. Most importantly you realize that just like life learning is a process that will never end till the day you die.

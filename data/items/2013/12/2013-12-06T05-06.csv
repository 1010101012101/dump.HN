You may put yourself in a situation where other people get rich off of your labor, and you get nothing because you bailed (again, assuming the product is that good).<p>It sounds like you have a sales problem. Find someone really good at sales and try to get them to join the effort. Sales cures all, and it&#x27;ll give you the 9 to 5 income, and slightly more regular hours, that I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d like to see coming in. With sales you can delegate some more of the labor that&#x27;s crushing you.<p>Also, if your product is stellar, you can probably raise serious venture capital and accomplish the same thing until you get sales up.<p>It&#x27;s often said that people tend to give up right before they get to the finish line. I happen to agree with that. Being a successful entrepreneur usually involves being able to endure pain that other people can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, making it possible to stay in the fight long enough to succeed.<p>The task is to balance this equation: hang on longer than you feel like you can, but not so long that you do permanent damage (monetary, mental, physical, relationship, whatever type) you can&#x27;t recover from. Getting that right gives you the best shot at success and limits the risk of regret.<p>If you&#x27;re really, really, really certain your heart isn&#x27;t in it, then bail in a way that perhaps enables you to retain a stake in the venture long term, and try to leave it in good hands.",1386309102

He doesn&#x27;t feel like he&#x27;s missing out on anything, because walking and taking the subway here are the norm. He doesn&#x27;t really need much assistance beyond that (he can actually get by without the white cane or a seeing eye dog).<p>While blind people certainly can and do find ways to live their lives in other cities, it means a lot to my friend that he can live as &quot;normally&quot; as possible here.",1386308014

Both commit human rights violations against the native population.  Both have (had) no clear path for the native population to become politically independent.

A large prefix would be a /30 for instance in IPv4. This generally is a very specific route and is considered a bad thing in the global BGP table. Why? Because you don&#x27;t advertise 2 reputable addresses at a time, you go for smaller prefixes to make the table manageable to make routing decisions on. So the no part is that generally all configurations of BGP will prevent the more specific routes like this. However it&#x27;s just a numbers game of advertising a prefix one bit larger than the real advertised by, say splitting that network in half.<p>As for the second part of the question, no. There&#x27;s no signing of any owned AS announcements. At best you can have a digest to validate your peer. But peering configurations in BGP are generally very specific, as in your peer is a host route, generally reachable directly via the transport provided by, say, a purchased circuit. So - is it trivial to swing routes on improperly configured downstream? Sure. You have to find a broken subset of routing configuration at a very critical point in the network though which would indicate a core router at a large telecom hotel is comprised or, an administrator is in cahoots with the redirect operation.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more with regard to possibilities - but just a high level take away.",1386306905

Every single person I know has a friend or family member that smokes, often times successful and happy people, and it's not a big deal if they do or they don't.

Graham mentions Detroit in passing in that article but doesn't acknowledge that, in the 1910s Detroit WAS a hub where enormous innovation was taking place. I want to ask: where did Detroit's nerds go? The region still is quite wealthy[0] and has more millionaires than San Jose. However Detroit has neither an intact urban core, nor a flagship university. The auto industry barons (like Henry Ford or Walter Chrysler) never built a namesake college, the reason for that I'm not really sure.<p>Graham also mentions Pittsburgh in the article. As a native of the city I think he discounts the changes that have taken place in the decades since he has lived here. There is definitely an interesting old urban city here with a reasonable sized start-up scene. The winter weather is no worse than a place like Boston. He's right about the lack of VC wealth, though.

3584087,comment,3583020,3583020,3,0,fluidcruft,,,"What resonates with me is the growing feeling of vulnerability with google integrating everything and weaving it through my entire online existence coupled with their arrogant refusal to deal with people except through deaf automated machines. It feels like you're playing hide-and-seek with a giant growing robotic panopticon that's trying to find arbitrary infractions as an excuse to disable access to Gmail. It's probably an irrational fear, I haven't been targeted yet (and neither has anyone I know), but I have also never had any positive experiences with google customer support. Fear is fear and it's insidious in a relationship. Maybe if I had a positive experience with google customer support at any point in my almost 8-year relationship with the company--anything to help me believe that ""things won't be so bad"" should things go wrong, I would feel differently. Heck, if they just sold real support at some fixed price/event I would probably be OK. I don't like feeling like helpless input to a triage operation.<p>For me, the Google warm fuzzies have all been evaporating since Google+ rolled out and people started to lose access to their Gmail because of pseudonyms on Google+. Now, bugs in a rollout are to be expected, but it was the stubborn-headed defenses of the policy and bans by deaf Googlers that's the most threatening to nobodies like me. Yeah Google fixed problems for VIPs, but I'm not a VIP. Unfortunately, Google really hasn't done anything to regain my trust and they continue to hide behind their machines while growing the beast larger.<p>Unfortunately for Google this all made the reality of my relationship with them very clear to me--Google is just maintaining a big enough herd that it sells to advertisers. It's the herd that matters, strays are expendable. In the months before Google+ rolled out I purchased my first smartphone (Android) to bring Google and Gmail further into my life. In the aftermath of Google+, I'm looking for ways out. I used to centralize all my email at Gmail, but I've started to undo that. For now I still have Android Market on my phone, but the other apps are being slowly purged and replaced as I have time to explore and learn about alternatives. (It also does not help that search has become awful seemingly in the last month or so. The latest example is that for whatever reason (even using verbatim mode/personalized/world etc) if you search for ""octave blah blah"" looking for information about using GNU Octave, Google's search insists on showing me page after page of results for ""matlab blah blah"" instead.)<p>My goal now is to make my Google account expendable. If I lose access, I want to be able to just easily create a new one. Clearly the fundamental problem is I place more value on my account than google places on me. I am toying with deliberately destroying my google accounts following a schedule of a few months (the only thing holding me back is my library of Android Market purchases)--I already do periodic deletions of my other social networking sites just because I find ekarma/gamification counterproductive to happiness.",1329104169

Go has a good, efficient memory model that lets me simulate a heck of a lot more of my world per megabyte of RAM.  In today's world of hosting, that translates into a huge impact on how many dollars per user/hour we need to pay to run our game.  That can have a direct translation into what kinds of business models can, and cannot, work for a game design.  I've actually written rudimentary versions of my world server in all of the languages I mentioned above, and Go is by far the best in terms of what I can do with memory.<p>Go makes it very easy to communicate between nodes, almost as easy as what you can do in Erlang.  Doozer is a library in Go for coordination of the activities of many machines, a lot like Zookeeper.  Between Doozer and Netchan, Go is a really solid choice for making a system like a world simulator that needs to be distributed among many computers.<p>Go is also better than Node.js for things that require manipulating binary data.  For example, I have some communications back and forth where the server is in Go, the client is in Python, and they talk using Protocol Buffers.  Javascript doesn't do binary (at all? not very well?) like Go or Java can.  There is an experimental protocol buffer library in Javascript, but in general Javascript needs to kind of bend over backwards to work with binary data.  It's possible to do it, but it's not natural or efficient.<p>In general, if you care about memory usage, working with binary data, tons of simultaneous threads/actors, building distributed systems, then Go is a great choice, especially if you want to do more than one of the above.",1329103803

The price of lithium from the ocean is only five times the cost from mining, and the cost of lithium represents a small fraction ( < $100) of an EV.<p>>And that brings us to yet another issue: the fact that lithium ion batteries, despite the name, just really dont use that much lithium. About 1.4 kilograms of lithium carbonate are needed per kilowatt hour of lithium-ion batteries. A kilowatt hour of bulk lithium ion batteries costs $300 to $500. Hence, lithium carbonate costs only make up 1/30th to 1/50th the cost of the cells! The price could increase tenfold and youd barely notice the difference.

- email being made out of secure or insecure protocols is irrelevant to gmail respecting privacy
- it is not about email security, it's about privacy.
- secure email is not a myth, see gpg
- one individual who could gain access to a mailbox is not the same order of magnitude than a transnational corporation systematically going through inboxes of milions of people.
- ""Google becomes evil and steals all your email to do X ""is not on your list of plausible threats because it's worded wrong, try ""Google goes through all your email and adds it to the info they have on you to build a very detailed profile of you and your life"" which goes on the confirmed list along with ""people have been locked out of the gmail accounts without a valid reason""
- Google is obviously about selling ads [1] and has to maintain trust from their users for this to work, it does not mean they have to respect people privacy, actually it even means the opposite, they have to breach on people's privacy and make it look so it won't hurt their users' trust.
- gmail has default https, sure, but only after a high profile case of hacked gmail accounts made it to the medias. [2]<p>Lastly, about the advice to never use @gmail.com addresses, I wonder if using our own domain would protect us from google having the abilty to lock us out of our inbox.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-apple-and-google-where-does-the-money-come-from/4469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-apple-and-google-wh...</a>

First, the bad:
1. It's really slow. Latency is usually on the order of seconds, as opposed to 100s of milliseconds on Google.
2. Results could be better. Roughly 80-90% of the time I find what I'm looking for, but the rest of the time Google does much better (note: it's possible that DDG is getting queries that Google misses).<p>Now, the good:
1. The one-box is really, really good. A lot of the time, I'm searching for domain-specific queries, especially when I'm coding. DDG brings up a one-box with something like a stack-overflow link and often has exactly the code snippet I'm looking for. 
2. I don't have to give more information to google. Admittedly, they already get my email and stuff, but at least this way I'm spreading my information so no one has absolutely all of it.<p>Finally, the things that are in principle useful but I don't use much:
1. Bang commands. Seriously, I'm not going to type !cplusplus to search cplusplus.com, I'll just click the first link. I also can't remember all of them. I do use !g, !image, and !video, but mainly because they take me to a better search engine. 
2. The search suggestions in the top right. It's a good idea, but I don't have the cognitive capacity to keep track of those in addition to the search results.",1329102261

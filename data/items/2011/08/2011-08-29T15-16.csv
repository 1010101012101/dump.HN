2937597,comment,2937100,2937413,10,0,scott_s,,,"""Virtual memory"" is not a synonym for swap space: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory</a><p>Virtual memory is what lets us write programs pretending that we own the entire address space, and it is <i>very</i> useful.<p>Swapping pages to disk, though, has been useful for a very long time. Yes, once your high-performance application starts swapping all the time, your performance is going to suffer by several orders of magnitude. But occasionally swapping pages in and out of disk is part of what makes modern operating systems useful. You left a large PowerPoint presentation open for several days, but never got around to working on it? Not a problem, since if the OS needs that memory, it will just swap out the pages. Without that ability, the OS would need to go around killing processes. (Which it will do if it has to, but it's a rare event because it can swap out pages.)",1314633588

Enterprise-grade SSDs are significantly more expensive than consumer-grade ones. You are not looking at $1~2/GB price, but $10~20/GB. Given the capacity required for most use cases, SSDs are hardly good choice for critical servers as primary storage.<p>In addition, most RMDBS are optimized for mechanical disks. Optimization for SSDs becomes interesting only recently when the price of SSD drops to be barely reasonable.<p>However, SSDs absolutely rocks as big cache.",1314633522

2937594,comment,2937129,2937272,6,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"Is that really what they're doing though?<p>The reason I ask is that their attempt to get discovery on the Apple license suggests that they don't know what the license covered (remember it was taken out not with Lodsys but with a previous patent holder).<p>If that's genuinely the position then they don't know what sort of case they've got. At the very best it would seem that they are hoping that there is enough wiggle room in the license to give them something but the request points to this being, at least to some degree, a punt as much as a clever legal move.<p>But to me what this really looks like is what we suspected it was all along - a legal shakedown of small, vulnerable developers without the finances or expertise to fight it.<p>Lodsys may or may not have a water tight legal case but from what we're seeing here they're certainly not geared up for a hardcore legal fight rooted in a solid basic case. Instead what they're doing seems to be throwing everything they can at it regardless of merit and hoping that something sticks.<p>In some situations that's a perfectly reasonable strategy - essentially if you're trying just to delay things and rack up costs for the other side to make settling look appealing - but against Apple who have enough money to fight this from pocket change and a vested interest not just in winning but in crushing you to put anyone else off the idea of ever trying this sort of thing again?",1314633514

2937560,comment,2936432,2937096,2,0,evilduck,,,"Maybe we have diverging definitions of minimalism, but I think minimalistic design leads to a sterile feeling but that you can still have a warm, personalized space with remarkably less stuff than the norm.<p>For example my desk was once home to three computers and various pieces of computer hardware laying around.  I don't <i>need</i> three computers, I really don't need a desktop computer at all anymore. Removing the desktops and the rat's nest of cabling makes things much easier to maintain and it looks much nicer. I also don't have to track what's going on with multiple computers anymore. No more sorting out cables, no more putting away bits and pieces, and the room looks cleaner now too.<p>Another, I like to cook so my kitchen tends to accumulate things either via stupid impulse buys, upgrades or gifts. I don't need a small toaster oven, I don't need a huge serving tray, I don't need four spatulas, three paring knives and two can openers. I have a wife and kid I feed -- we don't need a stack of 10 plates and 10 cups at hand (I can't even seat 10 people, let alone serve that many). Keeping the kitchen to a minimum means cleaning a few more things on demand while prepping and serving food but it reduces the cleaning, sorting and storage time requirements overall. This form of minimalism doesn't mean we can't have pictures on the wall or a vase of flowers on the table, but it's a huge win for reducing the total time spent in the kitchen every day.<p>For me, minimalism is about identifying my real requirements and removing the rest. Toys and old projects may be a requirement to keep the creative juices flowing, but I'd try to strike a balance between keeping stuff simply because there is sentiments attached and keeping stuff that really matters.",1314633178

The big thing was every piece of furniture I owned except for a desk, a small lamp and am Eames molded chair.  I did, however, have a walk-in closet full of clothes and boxes.  I also kept the computer, and the TV.<p>By having no furniture -- not even a mattress -- for months, it really changed my perspective on what I valued about furniture.  Sleeping and sitting on the floor tends to do that to you.  It really made me think about what I wanted in a bed, or in a couch, or whether I even wanted certain things at all.  It also forced me to focus on the space.  By most measures I lived in a very large apartment, but I started to notice how awful the floor plan was, how much room was wasted by an excessively large kitchen, oversized bathroom and tons of useless hallway... it was ""big"", but not in ways that were useful considering how you actually live in the space.<p>So 8 months later I downsized.  Over that period of time I got rid of more things.  Useless baubles and kitsch.  Clothes I never wore.  Books I never needed again.  I had purchased a nice bed, nightstands and two lamps, but hadn't acquired anything else, so I brought far fewer things into a considerably smaller space.<p>However, that smaller space was MUCH nicer than the larger one, for a bit less money, and in a ridiculously good location (subway across the street, in the city instead of 10 miles out).  My commute went from an hour a day to being able to stumble out of bed at the last minute and walk across the street.  Cleaning was just getting easier and easier.  With no junk around, you can just power steam, vacuum, or wipe down every surface very quickly.  I also seemed to have to clean less often, in addition to reducing it to maybe 30 minutes a week.  Insects?  What are those?  I think I've seen only a fruit fly and a spider in nearly 3 years.  Despite losing 250sqft, I think I only lost 20sqft of usable living space.<p>But I wasn't done.

In a crash your bitcoins would depreciate wildly because nobody would part with anything of value for some bits - or a piece of paper - or some shiny metal.<p>This is just inherent in trading - there has to be a difference in value or the trade wouldn't happen, and if there's a difference in value the values may not relatively correspond at all points.<p>To some people, at some times, a token may be a useful marker in trade, as cash is now. With World of Warcraft healthy, there can be a good market in magic swords. With a healthy world economy, cash can be useful. When either fails, current holders will suffer. Gold will suffer differently, it won't be counterfeit or lost, but it won't be liquid. Ditto for BTC, they just become irrelevant relative to food.<p>Gold is anonymous, but can't practically be traded that way in large quantities. Cash is only pseudonymous like BTC as usually used - bills are scanned when dispensed and deposited.

On the other hand, using search for mid-paragraph navigation is an order of magnitude less efficient in prose, when you're so much more likely to have symbols and words doing totally different things in many places in your text.",1314631127

It reads:<p>------------------------------------------------<p>You may have seen reports or received an email from us regarding a recent security breach on this developer.nokia.com/community discussion forum.<p>During our ongoing investigation of the incident we have discovered that a database table containing developer forum members' email addresses has been accessed, by exploiting a vulnerability in the bulletin board software that allowed an SQL Injection attack. Initially we believed that only a small number of these forum member records had been accessed, but further investigation has identified that the number is significantly larger.<p>The database table records includes members email addresses and, for fewer than 7% who chose to include them in their public profile, either birth dates, homepage URL or usernames for AIM, ICQ, MSN, Skype or Yahoo. However, they do not contain sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details and so we do not believe the security of forum members accounts is at risk. Other Nokia accounts are not affected.<p>We are not aware of any misuse of the accessed data, but we are communicating with affected forum members, though we believe the only potential impact to them may be unsolicited email. Nokia apologizes for this incident.<p>Though the initial vulnerability was addressed immediately, we have now taken the developer community website offline as a precautionary measure, while we conduct further investigations and security assessments. We hope to get the site back online as soon as possible and will post developments here in the meantime.<p>If you have any questions on this, please contact Nokia.developer-discussions-support@nokia.com.<p>The Nokia Developer website team.<p>------------------------------------------------",1314631063

2937393,comment,2935944,2936152,5,0,tsycho,,,"Very interesting comment, hadn't heard of Sortition before. However, I see a few practical problems with this.<p>First, it makes it harder to fix any errors/cheating. You can ask for a reevaluation of exam papers or a recount of the ballot if you felt that something shady happened, but then what about the randomization phase. In the admissions example for instance, if after a re-eval, the composition of students in the >95 percentile changed, do you hold a new randomization to make it fair for the new kids who crossed the threshold? If you do that, is that fair to those who previously got selected in the previous admissions ballot, and weren't second time lucky? Would this lead to all the ""losers"" in the lottery to ask for re-evals just so that the lottery phase happens again? (given a large number of students, if there is any subjectivity in the evaluation, every re-eval is likely to change the composition, even if by a small amount)<p>Secondly, the losers in the lottery are going to feel cheated and angry, even if all evaluation was objective, and there was [provably] no cheating. I think most humans prefer an objective, unambiguous way of competing with each other, even when we think that the evaluation metric is flawed. So the unlucky competitors will feel angry post-lottery, even if everything was done in a fair manner.<p>Finally, it increases the chances of cheating/gaming the system at the randomization phase i.e. the administrator can game the lottery. And if/when the administrators do cheat, it is also easier for them to hide their cheating since the anomaly can be hidden within the random luck factor.",1314630098

Or maybe they don't agree with the fact that Fawkes was a ""bad guy"". We'll never know because they don't bother to leave any comments.<p>If it's the latter: Look, <i>anyone</i>, repeat, anyone who plans to blow up people, for <i>any</i> cause whatsoever is a bad guy in my book. It doesn't matter how many people you kill, or what kind of people they were. If you disagree with this one, there isn't much to discuss, continue the downvoting if you want.<p>On the other hand, if you think that Anon's use of the mask does not portray the real Fawkes but the movie's depiction of him, that's a different matter.

    @view_config(route_name='hello')

The config.scan() bit causes the @view_config decorators to be picked up.  So we do have some decorators, although they don't populate an external registry (by design).<p>The rationale for putting the route ordering in imperative code instead of using decorator declaration order is in the document I linked.  I'm not particularly interested in crippling Pyramid for larger apps to race to the bottom of the LOC count.  It's succinct enough and works for truly large apps too.",1314630060

If there's a way to tweak early-childhood education to turn more women into potential startup founders, hackers, etc., that increases the number of startups and hackers available for startups, which is awesome.<p>It would be reasonable for YC to use successful women/minority applicants (Jessica Mah; Leah Culver; I'm sure there are others, plus of course Jessica Livingston's role as a partner) to demonstrate that women can be successful in startups.  Other than that, it's really something for parents, K12 educators, etc. to address.<p>Women do seem to be a lot better represented in bio/biotech than in computers/ee, so if over time more startups happen in the bio space, that should help to address the imbalance too.",1324465057

If the cost of starting a startup is lower then the potential for loss is lower which means the risk is also lower. More people are starting startups because it is less risky, not more. That means the number of companies being formed is going up; in turn, that means that more people are <i>taking the risk</i> of starting a company, whether they are risking much or not. This might seem a subtle distinction but I think it is an important one.<p>A week ago I sat down opposite an entrepreneur who built a 24-hour transaction layer on top of the UKs banking system which runs on nightly batch-processing. It made the transition from 9-3 banking to 24-hour online banking possible. He started out with a <i>really big</i> vision and had to take <i>really big</i> risks and the result was a <i>really big</i> company that created a lot of value economically and socially. It took him two decades and nearly bankrupted him on dozens of occasions. His vision sustained him. It kept him going through all the terrible lows and in the end he shook up one of the slowest-moving industries out there. That was a big risk. That was a big reward.",1324464995

This is indicated by the breadcrumbs at the top reading ""Home / Opinion / FP Comment"".<p>This strikes me as a rather poor excuse (if it's intended as such). I agree nobody should expect an opinion piece to be vigorously researched, cited, etc....but all opinions are not equal. There's a difference between someone who is just casually writing their thoughts with the understanding that they are not fully vetting them...and someone who is clearly biased and pushing a particular agenda.<p>> Wait, they didn't seize his computers because of one particular comment left on his blog by someone unknown?<p>Well, we can't know all their reasons...but based on the facts so far...no they didn't. They seized them because he referred to a possible hacker as ""our old friend"" and wrote an article/linked to the hacked emails....AND because a potential hacker commented on his blog, possibly leaving evidence in his account/on the server...then refused to cooperate with the investigation.<p>Are they justified doing so? I don't know. I think the ""old friend"" comment is  innocent. I also think based on what we know it's pretty frivolous. Unless they have some clear evidence linking this guy, I think they are overstepping their bounds. Of course they might have it...they're not gonna say.<p>One thing I would also say is that I don't think this guy is being treated any differently than anyone else who gets in the way of any government investigation (that is to say, poorly)....

ICC doesn't use a FOSS license, and it lags behind GCC, but it does provide a replacement backend for Visual C++, which can make it more usable in some environments.

People design custom worlds and publish them for others to play. These can be long narrative adventures, short puzzles, parkour courses, and some team sports have recently emerged.<p>6.

People have modified the game in amazing ways, and some mods have been incorporated into the official game. An official developer program is in the works.<p>7.

Someone here put it fairly bluntly a while back in the form of a ""How to tell if you're a hacker"" quick quiz.

If you don't even know what that means, you're probably not one.""<p>I think it's a useful skill to sharpen and definitely not limited to passing tests. There are diminishing returns to worry about for how much you want to try and game something, but having even a basic intuitive feel for it is pretty useful in ""the real world"".",1324461650

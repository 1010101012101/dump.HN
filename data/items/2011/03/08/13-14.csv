I like Puppet: its fail-safe and reliable.<p>There is, however, one thing I don't fancy in it. Puppet does not support insecure client–master communication. Requiring SSL communication is OK, but one should be able to switch it off if it brings no value.<p>We are running our our servers on AWS, and we rely solely on AWS security groups to grant and deny accesses. Puppet's SSL traffic brings no additional security to us; it only complicates matters. For example: we would like to shut down the Puppet master EC2 instances when they are not needed. However, this is not possible, since after start-up the EC2 instances have new IPs, and this breaks the Puppet-signed SSL certificates.",1299592702

2300820,story,,,1,5,mode0,"Ask HN: Where to go from here?  Or, I need out of govet contracting",,"Hello HN community,<p>I apologize if this has been addressed before on HN, I'm still scowering the posts via google but I desperately needed to get this up to start the conversation.  Apologies for the long post..<p>About 3 or so months ago I woke up and decided I needed to get out of my current career sector (government contracting - I'm in the Wash DC and surrounding metro areas).  For me, the day to day of government contracting has become unbearable.  Now I know there are a lot of people in the US hurting right now as far as jobs are concerned, and I don't want to come off as whiny so apologies and I will try to stick to my specific issues.  But I think that is part of my disatisfaction as well.<p>I've been working full time (more or less) as a programmer since 1997.  Part of that time was while I was a full time college student, then later during the .com run up I bailed on college for a higher salary.  I have since returned and received my BSc and I will complete my MS in comp sci this fall.  For most of that time I have been working as a government contractor for various agencies.  I also did about 4 years at two private companies - one a product company, and one a services-based company.  Well, when I say two private companies, what I really mean is non-government contracting.  I currently and always have worked for private companies, not as a government employee.<p>The allure of government contracting can be strong.  I was able to obtain a sought after security clearance.  While ""even Wayne Gretzky was traded,"" I have no doubt I could quit my job tomorrow and have multiple offers in a few days.  I make a great salary and have great benefits (at least I think so).  I never work overtime and my hours are flexible.  But the work is killing me.<p>The emphasis on the ""billable hour"" is relentless (see: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=650691).  Not to mention that probably about 50% of my coworkers are apathetic and are simply putting in the motions day to day - a strong job market (for us) coupled with very little accountability from their parent companies (""..as long as you are billable!"") contributes to this situation.  It is not uncommon for me to see coworkers doing sudoku puzzles, talking for all hours while doing no real work, or even clipping their finger nails in their cubicles (!).  That last one may not be specific to govt contracting..but you get the idea.  I know people who will be in that arena for life.  Good for them, they are taking care of their families, etc, but I don't want to work a job simply because it is damn near recession proof!<p>I've decided I want out.  I think I have a lot to offer the private sector - I'm intelligent, I understand the theory of computing (some of it, I think!), and I have an aptitude for picking up new tech and thinking through problems.  But I'm not sure where or how to start the transition.<p>I just turned 30, and while I have been somewhat following the non-Microsoft tech scene, I do not claim to be an expert (most of my career has centered around msft technologies).  I look at job postings for companies I have identified as being ""in"" the area I want to be involved with (I call this the ""HN arena"") and I see things like: Rails, nginx, NoSQL, memcached, etc as some examples.  I have no doubt I can learn these new technologies (new for me!) with some competency, and some I have been following for a while but never got around to working with (Rails, for example).  And I know that tools don't necessarily make the man.  But that is just a small list of some cool stuff I'd like to work with.<p>I know I learn best by doing, not reading a ton of books.  My initial plan is to build up some self-made projects, learn the tech, and begin doing more complex things on my own.  Posting code where I can, showing what I can do via github (actually I use mercurial, but you get the idea).  I'm not going to up and quit my job right now, but I'd like to begin a learning plan.<p>So, where do I go from here?  Any and all advice is appreciated.  Some postings I plan on reading today at lunch:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1830872\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=650437 (I'm not 40, but the title got me)<p>Thanks for your time.  If you know of any gems posted here on HN, I'd love a link.<p>Thanks.",1299592436

Most importantly is the `storedconfigs' which (afaict) require the puppet server to work.<p>This means that you lose a large amount of the power of using puppet, by which you can use configurations across machines to do things like collect up all the services you run on a set of machines and generate a nagios config, or firewall config, or whatever.  Without using stored configs for this I assume it's possible but will require more explicit configuration rather than the rather more elegant solution provided when using a puppet server.<p>Side note : I've used puppet on a fairly small scale of up to ~50 machines, and just started using it for VMs, and it's pretty straightforward to integrate into a bootstrap install to get ruby and puppet installed so that you can use it to install all the rest of the dependencies.

From ages 6 to 14, two of his friends taught me more about business and science than any kid can hope for, and I had a ball learning it.<p>The first was a small town shopkeeper who was our neighbor. Initially, I would go to his shop with my dad every Sunday and hang around and explore it for hours while they chatted. He would teach me bits and pieces about business more through example than words: treating customers and employees right, pricing products right, managing people etc. Eventually, I'd often go to his shop alone and hang out and sometimes he'd let me man the cash register for an hour or two. It was a huge responsibility and one that I was proud of. Many people today would consider a 8-14 year old going to a shop and hanging out with a 30 something shopkeeper alone weird, but I only benefited from this relationship. Obviously this was someone my parents knew and trusted, but I can't help but think these few years shaped my desires to be an entrepreneur and helped me along the way.<p>The second person was a guy who had a job building/fixing machinery at gas refineries who my dad went to school with. He was divorced early and never remarried, a recluse who liked to study and talk about physics and chemistry. He was also eccentric and (what I recognized later as) a consummate geek: generally shy but never shy about tearing apart bad/flawed arguments anyone made. He was also unfailingly fair about accepting defeat in arguments when he was wrong. In our small town, judging from the outside, I'd say most people would have called him a weirdo and they probably did. My parents trusted him though and I regularly hung out with him, often alone. He had a huge role to play in my interest in science and (what I hope is) my ability to never be shy about making my case, but to treat opponents fairly. Fun aside: this gentleman retired at 55 from his job with significant savings and went BACK to school for a Ph.D. in math, because he loves to learn.<p>NB: I do not have kids yet, and it is possible that some biological or cultural switch that goes on when I have children will change my perspective on this making me more protective. I hope it doesn't make me wary of all adults though.",1299591700

We noticed that it was attracting quite a bit of ""unqualified"" traffic, in the sense that it wasn't just developers signing up, but also end-users needing to send business correspondence from their desktops.  End-users aren't really well-served by that site because it quickly deteriorates into geek-speak, so we decided to try and give them a better home.<p>We researched end-users' use of the site and found a lot of them were sending plain MS Word or PDF files via email.  Hoping to ride on that trend, we've come out with PostalShout which targets business users who need to post mid-size quantities (hundreds to low thousands of letters per month) of postal mail.  The service lets them post transactional letters - invoices, reminders, simple marketing material, collections letters, etc. - directly from their word processor.<p>Does our targeting come across?

In societies that have only two age groups, children and adults, a culture can go along virtually unchanged for generation after generation, but as soon as there's a special age group for teenagers, things start to happen. The teenagers look for ways of demonstrating their fealty to their own age group  ways of showing that they're different from adults. They use weird forms of adornment that adults find unacceptable, and they invent new words or use old words in new ways. If people didn't keep graduating out of the teenage group and taking their vocabulary with them, eventually they would create a whole new language and the adults wouldn't be able to understand them. Which, of course, is just what they're after!""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2298961"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2298961</a>",1299589283

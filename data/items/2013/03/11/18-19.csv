Sometimes an afternoon snack is just a banana or a handful of grapes.<p>At a typical Atkins level of 20 grams carb per day, I'd be screwed by the time I'm done eating two apples for breakfast, and I've still got the rest of the day to go.<p>I don't think I'm unusual in that I paleo it around maybe 4 parts veg, 4 part fruit, 1 part meat, and maybe 1 part nuts and ""other (possibly non-paleo) stuff"" on a very long term average.  I don't think its physically possible to low carb if you eat about four times as much fruit as meat.  Its not so much that I eat huge amounts of fruit, its that I don't eat so much meat.  I ate a 24 oz steak once and literally felt sick, don't know if it was the massive fat content or some kind of protein overdose or just too much in the belly.  Lots more filet mignon than t-bone, that kind of thing.  I tend toward larger fraction of fruit for breakfast (aka two pieces of fruit per breakfast), larger fraction of veg for lunch (aka salad bar almost every day) and larger fraction of meat for dinner and a chunk of fruit before bedtime.

Then once you have a good set of features you can train the system to perform a specific task using those features.<p>As the network gets bigger and deeper the feature detectors become more abstract and capable of higher-level tasks. For example, given a bunch of images, a small network  might learn to distinguish straight lines from curvy lines, while a large network might learn to distinguish humans from cats.<p>So if deep learning actually works, then the main constraint on the capabilities of the learning system is compute power, not the cleverness of the domain experts writing your feature detectors.

The article at the end is worth a read, but I'll give you a summary: 27 million hogs produce an unbelievable amount of shit. This shit is collected in what Smithfield calls ""holding ponds"" - which are actually <i>lagoons</i> - that can run 30 feet deep. These ponds contain many extremely toxic substances in addition to good old pig shit. Even light rains can cause them to overflow. And the stuff is so vicious that people are often overcome by the fumes and are hospitalized. And if someone falls into the stuff, they die.<p>How does this stuff affect humans? Well, gravity causes the toxic material in the lagoons to seep down into the groundwater supplies. From there it arrives in people's sinks, showers, and drinking water.<p><a href=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/pork-s-dirty-secret-the-nation-s-top-hog-producer-is-also-one-of-america-s-worst-polluters/13479"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalresearch.ca/pork-s-dirty-secret-the-nation-...</a>",1363027122

Something hugely (lol) wrong with two packs of twinkies every lunch.<p>The ""newer"" it is, the worse it probably is to eat, and the older it is, the better it probably is to eat.  Do your weekly/monthly meal planning based on that.  I intentionally eat roughly 100 times as much apple by weight as chocolate.  That doesn't mean I only eat apple or never eat chocolate.  Most of my meals look something like a large salad, a large vegetable side dish, a relatively modest hunk of meat, and some citrus / fruit / berries for desert.  I'm hardly starving or restraining myself.  I'm actually something of a gourmet glutton.  I just eat ""old school"" instead of modern stuff.<p>BTW in the olden days not every piece of fruit was supermarket scale picture perfect, as anyone who's hand picked their own strawberries probably knows?  You're hungry, the somewhat fermented grapes still taste OK-ish... your liver evolved to clean up the poison... Ethanol is not supposed to be a primary source of calories, its a moderately toxic systemic poison which your body is fairly tolerant of, well at least compared to cyanides or organomercury compounds.  Drinking it on a regular basis is about as stupid as eating arsenic or lead salts for kicks.  Another good comparison is getting buzzed drunk is about as intelligent as sniffing carbon monoxide until dizzy.  None the less as per the granny example above a glass of booze once in an occasional while is OK.  Just as long as most of the time, lets say 10000 to 1 ratio, you drink water instead of chugging a beer.  I actually like beer, I just don't drink 12 per night or even 1 per week.  How often would you be comfortable drinking anti-freeze?  I drink booze a little more often than that, but not much.<p>In a similar way there's nothing really wrong with an occasional pack of twinkies, as long as your lifetime average is running around 1000 carrots (or equiv) per twinkie.<p>I have noticed long term that tastes and physical reaction changes... I used to like jello, but now it kinda grosses me out.  I mean I could eat some once in awhile, but I really don't want to anymore.  Or ice cream, once you're not carb addicted anymore, lets be realistic, its sickly sweet combined with a mouth feel and texture like cold olive oil pouring down your throat, eww thats just gross, like sugar mixed with crisco shortening or ""equal"" artificial sweetener mixed with lard.  Once in awhile I have some anyway and remind myself why I don't miss it anymore.

Looking right now Eclipse (the GUI from hell) alone is using 608Mb of memory. I know it has a lot of useful features, but 608Mb is a crazy amount of memory to use for a fancy text editor.<p>I'm also using Notepad++ with tons of plug-ins, and it takes up <10Mb. Eclipse does more, but really, does it do THAT much more?<p>And SKYPE is taking 90Mb to sit idle. I use Skype to chat with business clients, so I can't easily just toss it, despite that Pidgin is using 21Mb to connect to 4 different chat networks simultaneously and Skype only connects to one...<p>The list goes on. And I need to upgrade to 16Gb soon (though looking at the memory usage right now, shortly after a reboot, I'm ""only"" at 4.1Gb, so it's not critical yet). Sigh.",1363025492

I would think that is a worthy goal and a worthy market to target. How many founders over the years have given up as much as a percent or two of their equity just to get fee deferrals from law firms that would enable them to get to first funding? And paid sizable fees to boot? Credible founders do not begrudge a lawyer his hire they also do not want the legal part to take more than its fair share of the budget or the equity.<p>Clerky offers as a first step a standardized Delaware C-corp approach to startup launch, and a skillfully done one at that. Its site suggests that it will targeting as well the remaining steps on the standardized path, right down to ones that will facilitate efficient and low-cost handling of all the important steps leading to first funding. This is not a modest goal - it is <i>huge</i>.<p>In law, there are strict limits to how far anything ""standardized"" can go - law is simply too big and complex to be reduced to simple recurring steps in any important area. For this reason, the role of the lawyer (even as to the standardized aspects) will not soon be displaced. Indeed, traps and issues abound for founders in setting up their companies, in funding them, and in dealing with a whole host of legal issues that will crop up. It always has been, and remains, foolhardy for founders to wing it in this area once they get beyond the very early positioning parts of their ventures. The beauty of what Clerky seeks to do, however, lies in providing ways to make it all easier both for founders <i>and</i> for lawyers and thereby setting up ways of doing collaborative relationships by which all concerned will benefit. I am a lawyer. I have done this stuff for years. But I have no stake in wanting to do any of this the clunky way if there is a simple and elegant way at hand. I welcome what Clerky is trying to do and look forward to its benefits as they roll out their services. The fact that founders can save on fees is not a threat but instead an opportunity for me to focus on the parts I do best rather than the repetitive parts.<p>The beauty of Clerky, as I see it, is that the founders, having worked extensively as superb startup lawyers in their own right, have a keen sense of how all this works and are aiming to develop a service that truly deals with the issues that have burdened clients and lawyers alike. It is a tall challenge but, if anyone can do it, this is the right team, especially working within the innovative framework provided by YC and the startup community. It will be fascinating to see how it all unfolds.",1363024844

489437,comment,483061,484030,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Keep in mind that the problems we're having aren't with XMPP, per se, just with ejabberd.  Ejabberd worked flawlessly for several months until it started exhibiting some very strange behavior and performance characteristics.  We upgraded to a newer version and we suddenly ran into another, different set of strange behaviors.<p>That said, word on the street is that ejabberd is the best implementation of an XMPP server.  AMQP supposedly offers better reliability (with RabbitMQ) as well as a whole lot of pretty cool features that Jabber really doesn't.",1235174383

It's basically just a notebook of RTF (with images) pages.<p>The simple magic for me is that you can just Cmd-N and start typing, and then when you're done, Cmd-R to rename/title it.   No saving, obviously, but also no shift-tab or clicking in a title field.  There's also a services menu shortcut for clippings: Cmd-Shift-X.<p>Contrast with Yojimbo (and many others), where a new note defaults to the title field.  You have to either press enter twice or tab three times just to get the cursor to the note field.  Even the ""Quick Input"" panel asks you for a title and tags first.",1235173458

I took the cheaters route by working for already well established blogs, but plenty of bloggers who have started in the past few years are doing well (people like Allen Stern or Louis Gray, who were late to the game, come to mind) -- they just work their asses off to get there.<p>3. It's true that most bloggers won't make money off a personal blog directly (i.e., via advertising).  But many will make money _indirectly_ via consulting gigs, other work offers, speaking engagements, book deals.  Blogging is one of the absolute best ways to raise your profile in your field and create demand for yourself.<p>3a. Even Dan Lyons made very good money from Fake Steve -- not from ads, but how about that book deal?  All those speaking engagements?  Even his switch from Forbes to Newsweek was likely influenced by his blog's success.  He conveniently leaves all that out of his article, though.",1235172437

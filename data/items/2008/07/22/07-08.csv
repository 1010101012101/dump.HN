253077,comment,252655,252815,0,0,greyman,,,"This sounds to me like you are implying that journalism is a less important profession, since they are only criticizing things and writing about them, and not actually change them directly? Or, I don't get your point... (ok, Arrington is something between journalist and a blogger, but my objection still applies).",1216710799

253075,story,,,6,7,amarcus,"Ask YC: Is this a good idea?",,"I've had this idea for about 2-3 years.<p>In a single sentence: It's google adwords for the real world.<p>Let me explain:\nTwo types of users: Realestate Owners (RO) and Publishers.\nAn RO will login to a website and enter details about their physical location (where they live etc...). Based on traffic patters calculated automatically, they get assigned a score. This determines how much traffic (cars and pedestrians) go past that location everyday.<p>A publisher would then login to the website and search for locations they would like to advertise. They choose a location by any number of factors (score, street name etc..) and can put in a bid to advertise at that location.<p>The RO can then login and accept the bid. After the bid is accepted, the publisher would then send over a mini-billboard that the RO would place in his front yard for everyone to see.<p>This would not only just work for houses but will also work for cars - if a person travels long distance everyday, then they can get some money back by putting a stickers advertising a product.<p>I have done minor research on this and it looks feasable.<p>The way we make money is by takings a percentage of the agreed price between the RO and the publisher.<p>What does the HN community think?",1216710664

At work, I shoot and edit a lot of videos (A new one each month or so) on products we carry. Right now, we have them all on YouTube but the quality DOES shrink down a lot<p>I looked into Vimeo but they do not allow videos that promote a product (basically an ad). Anything with the quality and easability of Vimeo out there without that restriction?",1211165273

193808,comment,192654,192856,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> The problem with many types of procrastination is that they're not even all that fun.<p>There was a period in my life, at my first job, where I was so fed up and bored with what I was supposed to be working on that I just avoided it by surfing the net all day, for months. You would think that goofing off all day on the internet and getting paid for it would be fun, but honestly it made things even worse.<p>Procrastination seems to be like a drug... it can be refreshing (or at least not painful) in small doses, but after a while you just get strung out and depressed. I had this huge weight over my head about what I ""should be doing,"" but absolutely no motivation to actually do it. It took a conscious act of avoiding my web browser to stop that pattern of self-destructive behavior and get some work done again.<p>So yeah, anyway, just wanted to add my data point. Procrastinating can often make your mental well being worse off, by throwing in guilt on top of whatever was bothering you in the first place.",1211165233

193801,comment,193619,193760,0,0,sbt,,,"I apologize for being vague. First off, Scandinavia is not socialist. It is pragmatic, if anything. Secondly, when I said socialism doesn't scale I was thinking about countries with at least 20 million citizens. However, it seems likely that some of the policies employed in Scandinavia in general simply wouldn't apply to a country like the UK. It seems likely that larger populations are more difficult to organize, and one has to resort to a more ""greedy"" approach.<p>That said, Scandinavia is not all about homogenity and scale. It's also about culture: work-ethic, egalitarianism and a culture where people don't just screw each other over to make a fast buck.",1211164609
193800,comment,193597,193597,0,0,ambition,,,"I think of job satisfaction as a function with weighted attributes. There's a ""perks at work"" attribute, a money attribute, an attribute for how much you like your team, how many weekly hours the work culture demands of you, how much you like your boss, whether the work is meaningful and related to your life goals, the opportunities to advance in the company and to grow as a person, whether you can live in a location you like, etc. etc. Google's problem relative to this article is that for many people, the ""perks at work"" weighting isn't that high. So no matter how good Google's perks are, other factors can dominate.<p>I think there might be a bit of an effect where people don't appreciate what they don't have to pay for, too.",1211164541

Most acquisitions are pretty disastrous in terms of clashing company cultures, new power struggles, and the best people of the acquired entity leaving.<p>The main argument for this acquisition seems to be ""to compete with google"", which further seems to boil down to ""to compete with adsense"".<p>Why then can't MS and yahoo just do a joint venture ad network to compete with adsense instead of MS trying to swallow yahoo whole?<p>My only ""answer"" is that MS a) has too much cash they need to get rid of (fast?), and b) doesn't realize that some people find them as repugnant as the proverbial creepy child-molesting uncle.",1211163488

Secretly you don't want to tell anybody because they might shut you down. So nobody will find out about it and you'll just be smug and self-righteous until you wake up one day and realize your 43 and still working at GeekSquad.<p>I worry more about getting discouraged and giving up.  How do I stay focused? I tell everyone who will listen. New Competitors? None. Advice and connections? Tons.<p>And the best part: Once people know what you are doing you can't just quietly give up-- you have to fail spectacularly!

6366323,comment,6366230,6366230,7,0,acqq,,,"The most interesting conclusions of Mike Pall reflect my experiences: sampling profilers are often much more usable in practice than instrumentation:<p><i>As you might have noticed, I had to change my plans compared to
the original approach presented in June. The main problem with the
instrumenting profiler was finding high-precision and high-speed
timing sources for all platforms.</i> (...) <i>The necessary pipeline flushes shadowed the
actual timings up to the point where the measurements were less
accurate than with a sampling profiler! Other platforms offered
only inaccurate timing sources or none that are accessible from
user mode. And to top it off, the instrumentation added
considerable overhead.</i> (...) <i>I had to scrap that work and decided to go with a sampling
profiler.</i><p>And I don&#x27;t know any other scripting language with a built-in sampling profiler. Does anybody?",1378893562

That&#x27;s what that whole paragraph was about.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t call you a reactionary dullard.  I see that your literacy is as poor as your numeracy.  What I said was that such was the principle use of referencing political correctness, and advised that you could do better yourself.

Kenya faces a water crisis, and water cuts were not uncommon even for those with access to tap water when I lived in Kenya around the turn of the millennium (I don&#x27;t know how it is now).<p>However, because of its perception as a common-pool resourceland owners think they are entitled to the water beneath their landgroundwater management seems to me to present a particular challenge. Are there any success stories in sustainable groundwater management that Kenya could look at?

Motion sensors can be used to suppress Wi-Fi scanning and/or GPS localization during the roughly 89% of the time humans are not moving. Remember, phones continually scan for new Wi-Fi APs in the background even when the screen is off. On modern phones with a/b/g/n chipsets (32 channels to scan) and energy-expensive CPUs (i.e. Exynos) this takes a huge amount of power.<p>Motion sensors themselves are really energy-cheap but the main CPU needs to be on to sample them, which basically means that if you want continuous mobility detection you&#x27;re going to burn through your battery pretty quickly, which is why it isn&#x27;t used much. You can do some CPU duty-cycling, but wake-up and suspend overhead is pretty bad and can amount to as much as 50% of the total energy spent. I haven&#x27;t done any measurements on an iPhone, but a GS2 Exynos 4 is a terrible energy drain, while an something like an OMAP 4460 (e.g. Galaxy Nexus) is much more efficient.<p>By offloading mobility detection to a separate chip you can bring down the overhead to tens of mW.

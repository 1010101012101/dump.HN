They're immature and show a complete lack of understanding of software development. Choosing the right tool for the job is rarely easy as ""high level"" and ""low level"".<p>Git was created to solve a specific need: Distributed development of the Linux kernel. The fact that it's been adopted by so many developers outside of the Kernel community shows that it is at <i>minimum</i> an adequate tool for the job. I'd go ahead and say, for those developers, Git > Mercurial. That's why they choose it.<p>For the developers who choose Mercurial, Mercurial > Git. That's why they've chosen Mercurial.<p>Please, before you publish stuff like this, remember that we're all on the same team. Next time, advocate Mercurial by talking about how it's improved your workflow. Talk about why Mercurial is better than Git for <i>you</i>, perhaps talk about the technical differences of the underlying implementations on a conceptual level.<p>That way, maybe you could help someone make an informed choice about what to use, instead of basing their decision on something as silly as the language it's written in.",1248396970

720683,comment,720569,720628,0,0,pyre,,,"Right, but I don't think that even the publisher/rights-holder could _sue_ you to force you to return the book based just on the fact that it was an illegally sold copy. _Stolen_ goods that are resold can be repossessed, but that is because they have a 'rightful owner' of a physical item.  The publishers aren't trying to repossess ebooks in an attempt to fill their shelves so that the ebooks can be resold...<p>In cases like this, the 'best' course of action is just for Amazon to eat the costs since it was their mistake and not to punish their customers for it. Instead of just pulling the book and refunding them their money, Amazon could have sent them a print copy of 1984 and/or given them some store credit for the trouble.<p>Even if there was no reason for Bezos to apologize for action of pulling the book, the fact that the book was being sold illegally and Amazon had to inconvenience its customers in trying to rectify the situation demands an apology. Well 'demands' from a customer service perspective... Amazon is welcome to treat its customer-base like crap, but they'll have to deal with the consequences.<p>I think it's telling that Bezos didn't really put much content into the apology as to which parts -- specifically -- he is apologizing for.  He could just be apologizing that the company didn't do more to compensate the affected customers per my suggestion above.<p>{edit} Furthermore, you say '...because breaking in is illegal, not because copyright law prohibits it,' but so far as I know copyright law does _not_ grant rights-holders the ability to repossess illegally produced copies from unsuspecting purchasers. And the way you state this is rather disingenuous. You seem to be implying that copyright-holders can take the book back from you, it's just that the 'breaking and entering' part is illegal, so they have to use some other means. {/edit}",1248395535

(Webapp Hosting)",,"Hey,<p>I know this topic has come up a million or so times on this site, but I couldn't think of a better place for advice on a web application that is in need of hosting soon.<p>I've used Liquidweb's dedicated servers for most of my previous applications. They're powerful, come configured ready to go (apache, php, mysql, mail, panel, etc), and the support is by far the best. My main concern now, is scaling, server power, reliability, etc (who's isn't, right?). The webapp is built on Drupal. When clients sign up, they automatically get a private copy of the application, available via a subdomain (single codebase, separate DB). Because of that sort of system, and my desire for a massive amount of clients, scaling and server resources are a big issue (having a hundred or so subsites operating together, big cron jobs, indexing, etc). I first considered getting two dedicated, one for DB, and one for everything else. But Amazon's, GoGrids, and Rackspaces cloud offerings seem worthy of a try.<p>I have no experience using any cloud-like services so I don't really know what to expect. What worries me a bit, is that I don't want to have to install and configure everything needed by the servers (mail, web, db, panel, etc). I'm pretty sure none of these services come preconfigured like that, and I don't know how well any of their support is (and monitoring is probably non-existent). They also seem a little expensive to be running 24/7/365. Most of the wording on the site place emphasis on the service being for temporary server power, computation, etc.<p>I greatly appreciate any feedback, thoughts, advice, etc..<p>Thanks as always",1248394625

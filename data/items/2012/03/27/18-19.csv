3763072,comment,3762810,3762810,3,0,cjensen,,,"The Mac software scene has always had lots of indie developers.  Let's look at that scene for some facts...  The indies generally charge an upgrade fee for ""major"" versions, and give free upgrades for ""minor"" updates.<p>Most, like Wil, do the right thing.  Delicious Library hasn't had a major release in years, but it is maintained.<p>Others (for example, in my experience ""DVD Remaster Pro"" and Parallels Desktop), clearly abuse the major update system as a revenue source.  They release fake major releases with lots of new skin but few features every six months or a year to rake in the dough.<p>Honestly, it's a mess.  But the solution to me is obvious: Angry Birds from Rovio.  Rovio didn't just release the thing and stop.  They keep adding significant features (the game is probably 10X as large as when I bought it for the iPad). Customers feed back with great reviews.  Rovio is rewarded with continuing sales and stays in the top seller lists.  Meanwhile, apps like ""Plants v. Zombies"" are static and drop off the top lists quickly after a quick burst of popularity.",1332874703

Both are necessary to grow and sustain an open community project. You bring people in and get them engaged whilst reinforcing what the project is focused on, its tone, style, and mission.<p>Making a decision civilly, whether everyone agrees or not, is very reassuring to newcomers and oldtimers alike.

I focused my post around the power requirements of the image processor circuitry.  However, there are two additional components to an LCD display system:  Display logic and Backlight power.<p>Display logic is, as the name implies, all of the circuitry required to drive the pixels.  This is everything from the data connector on the raw LCD panel up to and including the TFT transistors on the glass itself and the transparent interconnects (also on the glass).  The on-glass circuitry has complex parasitics and capacitive loading that also causes a fluctuation of drive current based on the randomness of the images.<p>Here's sample data from a 24 inch 1920 x 1200 LCD:<p><pre><code>  24 inch, 1920 x 1200\n  Idd  for full black screen = 1,700mA\n  Idd for a black/white dot pattern = 3,050mA\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, a pattern with maximal excursions in the data causes the display logic current (and therefore, power) to nearly double.<p>In very (very!) rough terms this current is also a function of display resolution:  Twice as many pixels will demand double the current.  Going back to the iPad 2 vs 3 example, the the new iPad has exactly four times the pixels of the iPad 2 display, therefore, it should require four times more display logic current than the older model under all uses cases.<p>The backlight may or may not demand more current as display resolution increases.  Comparisons of displays of equal physical size but vastly different resolutions do not reveal a this effect to be an absolute rule.  A lot depends on the design of the panel and the internal optics.",1332873245

As a client, you can create a REQ socket and connect it to multiple redundant devices. But if a device goes down, you will have to handle timeouts and repeat requests yourself. Additionally, ØMQ will not ""kick out"" the dead endpoint, so you will end up with 1 out of N requests timing out. So you have to add a decent amount of code in your RPC layer to make everything work properly. And you need to run ZMQ devices anyway. Running a local HAProxy with a 5 lines configuration is, IMHO, simpler than running an extra device somewhere + having to add a lot of HA-related code in the RPC layer. Of course, in the long run, it's more elegant to use XREQ + heartbeat to connect to multiple endpoints and send requests only to those which are alive. But in the short run, the HAProxy broker is dead simple and works very well :-)",1332872582

3762859,comment,3762142,3762705,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"No, I don't think it was supposed to free us from wysiwyg the way you mean. The real purpose of Markdown was creating a markup language that can be easily read and understood by humans and rendered like HTML. It's an HTML replacement for some use cases. When it's been parsed and rendered its easy to read and when you look at it as plain text it's still easy to read (not to mention write) even by people not familiar with code whatsoever.<p>Imagine you build a simple website for someone and allow them to edit it. You could give them a WYSIWYG editor with formatting buttons but those editors usually override some of your styles and produce messy code. Or you can give them this Markdown WYSIWYG editor and in most cases it's easier to be sure it won't override your styles and keeps the focus on content. I love that idea. I've had lots of success with teaching very non-tech savvy people markdown in 5 minutes flat. And since most markdown converters I know produce very minimal clean HTML i can be sure my styles won't be overridden. Compare that to something like Wordpress' editor which produces all sorts of sloppy, obsolete code riddled with spans and stuff that overrides my CSS and this is awesome!<p>So what I'm saying is that Markdown isn't just for text editors. It's for anything that requires the final product to be nicely formatted and the raw code to still he human readable. One of my current hobby projects is an online notes app that automatically converts your writing to Markdown if you use it and I love it.

I have been programming for years and OOP has become second nature to me; I know how to apply OOP, but have long forgotten most of the terms.<p>In my view, when interviewing, the questions should be practical problem so it tests user's ability to program a solution, not about being able to churn out the definition. \nExample: If you want to test someone's OOP expertise, give the person a list of classes and ask them to create a UML or how they would structure their classes.\nExample 2: Give them a problem like, create 2 classes: Animal and Dog. All animals have a name and a dog can bark. Test to see if the programmer would extend Animal class from Dog class, or maybe he decides to make an Abstract class out of Animal class.<p>The only downside of these questions is that you would need to have interviews who are competent in the OOP concepts themselves. Continuing to ask dictionary questions is a cop-out solution to not having technical interviewers and it is easier for someone to check if interviewee is able to mention some of the keywords that are in the definition you found on wikipedia.<p>Unfortunately, you will continue to reject most developer job applications and miss out on lot of great candidates.",1332871261

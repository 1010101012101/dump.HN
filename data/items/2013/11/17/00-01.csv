But that said, if people want it it should exist.<p>The reason I say leave Google is simply because if we don&#x27;t support platforms that work along the lines we want them to, they may not exist. People despise Facebook&#x27;s policies, yet they stay on it because &quot;there&#x27;s no other choice&quot;. So my point was that we kindof just need to nut up & stop using platforms that we feel don&#x27;t respect our wishes. If I had some videos to post I&#x27;d prob put them on Vimeo. With video posting, it&#x27;s not really an all-or-nothing situation like Facebook. It&#x27;s a technical need, not a social network.",1384649954

6747080,comment,6742780,6743908,1,0,mikeash,,,"When you look at how easy it is to commit acts of terrorism, and how few acts of terrorism actually happen in this country, it becomes clear that the only reason for that is that there are very few motivated people.<p>Automatic weapons are extremely easy to come by in this country. Think of the havoc you could create just walking up to an airport security checkpoint at rush hour and opening fire. If you know a few like-minded individuals, then you could synchronize the attacks to happen simultaneously at, say, JFK, Dulles, Reagan, and LAX. The casualties would be immense, and the subsequent panic would be enormous.<p>There are about a million other possible scenarios you can cook up that take no more than a few semi-intelligent nutcases and a few thousand dollars. Of those million, the current system defends against perhaps ten.<p>Although, when you look at it objectively, those attacks <i>do</i> happen fairly frequently. Navy Yard, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and many more. But we don&#x27;t call them &quot;terrorism&quot;... why? Only because it doesn&#x27;t fit the overly-specific mold that &quot;terrorism&quot; consists of. If they were brown middle-easterners shooting up schools, we&#x27;d call it terrorism no problem, but since it&#x27;s a white dude, we call it something else. And because of that, there is basically no anti-terrorism effort directed at these things, furthering the argument that such efforts are completely useless.",1384649678

It&#x27;s forecast that human population will max out late this century due to declining birthrates in countries that are growing wealthier; hitting the theoretical limits (e.g. max solar output) before then is so implausible it&#x27;s barely worth discussing.<p>> Again, he covers this in his first post via reductio ad absurdum:<p>His assertion that SSP (and everything else) is impractical for sustaining 2% growth for a millennium is true, but practically irrelevant. Space-based exploitation can increase the plateau cap, allowing for higher standards of living for a future populace whose population is level or declining.",1384649391

Even with our interviews as short as they are, we typically spend 200+ hours doing interviews each batch. So while we&#x27;d love to do longer interviews, it&#x27;d mean interviewing many fewer people, which we don&#x27;t think is a good tradeoff (either for us or for applicants in general).<p>2) Again, because of time constraints, we can&#x27;t give everyone detailed, specific feedback. However, if you email me (nick [at] hackerschool.com) the email address you applied with, I will do my best to get you specific feedback on your code.<p>3) I&#x27;m the first to admit that our admissions process is far from perfect. It&#x27;s undoubtedly one of the hardest, most psychologically draining parts of running Hacker School. Even if we assume we get it &quot;right&quot; 95% of the time (which is probably <i>way</i> too generous to us), it still means we&#x27;re going to make dozens of mistakes each batch :(<p>4) We occasionally will ask people questions along the lines of &quot;what&#x27;s the hardest thing you&#x27;ve worked on?&quot; We&#x27;ve found this usually leads to a discussion of interesting challenges and problems people have faced, how they&#x27;ve approached them, etc. It&#x27;s in no meant to be &quot;dickwaving&quot; or in any way arrogant.<p>I hope whatever other path you&#x27;ve ended up on to continue growing as a programmer has been fruitful and enjoyable!",1384649368

(A nice little money earning industry for the CC companies btw!)<p>As a customer, I&#x27;d rather pay with my CC so I have some protection over my payment.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s better from both points of view, then drugs is the obvious one that springs to mind.<p>Consumer based foreign exchange (swapping my GBP for USD for my holiday to USD) by using Bitcoin as an intermediary vehicle could save me a ton of money as well, this isn&#x27;t exactly possible yet but would be awesome if it could be done one day.  It&#x27;s better for everyone except the rip off middle men who charge horrible fees and rate spreads.<p>Another service that would be better with Bitcoin would be remittance.  This one is cited often, and should not be overlooked.  Again, middle men banks and rip off services are the only ones who would suffer.  And it&#x27;s a huge huge market.<p>Take a look at the control large institutions have on the market as well to see further benefit.  Wikileaks for example endured a &quot;banking blockade&quot;.  The banking industry stopped for a moment in time Wikileaks being able to accept donations via Mastercard, Visa etc.  With Bitcoin, no corporations can interfere with fund raising.<p>What about charity?<p>> When you donate via credit card, the charity has to pay a transaction fee of 2-3% on the transaction. If you make a $100 donation, your charity only gets $97 of it. According to a Huffington Post article, banks and card networks make about $250 million a year off of charitable donations.\n<a href=""http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/nonprofits/donate-charities-corporations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/nonprofits/donate-charities-c...</a><p>Let&#x27;s cut these middle men out of the equation, if I donate to charity 100% of my Bitcoin are guaranteed to arrive in their control.

This allows you to avoid making merge commits.<p>Interactive mode rebase, for example:<p><pre><code>    git rebase -i HEAD~4\n</code></pre>\nwill let you rewrite the last commits.  You can use it for lots of things like:  changing commit messages, changing commit contents, add new commits in the middle of a sequence, squash multiple commits into one.<p><pre><code>    git filter-branch\n</code></pre>\ncan be used to apply a script to all the commits in a branch.

I wouldn&#x27;t call push --force, reset --hard and gc commands that destroy history; instead I think of them as commands that help you work with different views of history.  E.g. doing git rebase -i followed by git push -f, the rebase is what actually rewrites history while the git push -f merely propogates the rewritten history to a remote repo.",1384649333

6747039,comment,6742780,6743488,1,0,mikeash,,,"I don&#x27;t think your analysis quite works, because the scenario in which nobody acts has the worst possible outcome.<p>Let&#x27;s make a terribly naive model in which there are 200 passengers, and the percentage chance of them succeeding in fighting back against hijackers is equal to the number of passengers who fights back. One passenger fights back means 1% chance of success, 50 passengers means 50% chance, 100 means 100% chance, and any more just saturates at 100%. This is wrong since the real-world chances are almost certainly not linear, but I think the basic idea of the chance starting at zero and increasing with the number of passengers fighting is sound.<p>Now, start with a case where nobody fights back. That means there is a 100% chance that everybody is going to die. Thus nobody has anything to lose. If they fight back, then they have a chance at living. If they don&#x27;t, they are certain to die. The rational choice is then to fight back.<p>Now, some people have chosen to fight back. Do you join them, or do you wait? Joining them increases the odds of success, and therefore your risk of death. Not joining them increases your risk of death.<p>The one complication in this is your chance of being killed in the fighting when the hijackers are defeated. However, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to suppose that your individual chances of dying go down the more passengers who fight back. If many others are also fighting, your odds of dying are low. If few others are also fighting, your odds of dying in the fight are high, but your odds of dying because they lost the fight are also high. I suspect that the rational course of action is going to be to join them as long as the fighting group is smaller than a pretty large size.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s impossible for there to be a rational equilibrium in which nobody fights back, because all actors improve their odds of survival by choosing to fight back in that case, even if they end up acting alone.

The problem is how to obtain, in the end and from this, the <i>meetings</i> of two mice which were in the same box in an overlapping period.<p>Right now I have a MySQL database where the simulation directly inserts each stay result. And then another tool,written in Scala, just retrieves all stay result, in portions of a few hundred, loops through them and for each asks the database which stays were overlapping with it, and inserts each pair into the database, like this:<p>`box`,`id1`, `res_id1`, `id2`, `res_id2`, `from`, `to`, `dt`, `typ`<p>This means that mice id1 and id2 were in the box &quot;box&quot; in the interval between &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; with duration &quot;dt&quot; and the meetings was of type &quot;typ&quot;.

It sounds like git can&#x27;t store 0-length data, but, it stores empty files (data, wrt your smalltalk example) just fine.  So that must mean that it&#x27;s not distinguishing between files and directories.  It&#x27;s probably also not storing other metadata like executable or permissions flags, labels (like on Mac OS), both creation AND modification dates, etc etc (but that&#x27;s beyond the scope of this discussion).<p>Does anyone know if git stores the path separator as part of the path?  For example does it store a path reference as a string &quot;/var/log&quot; or as a list {&quot;var&quot;, &quot;log&quot;} internally?  That gives us 2 options:<p>1) If git DOESN&#x27;T store the path separator, then that means there&#x27;s no way to represent a directory as &quot;var/&quot;, to signify that it&#x27;s a directory (because a file could contain the path separator character).  If that&#x27;s the case, then perhaps I was wrong to call it a political decision.  An argument can be made for purity here.<p>2) If git DOES store the path separator inside a path string, then a mistake was made, because there was a chance there to distinguish between a directory &quot;var/&quot; and a file &quot;var&quot;.  Sometimes I refer to these types of mistakes as political decisions, for example if it&#x27;s easier to make the mistake than work through a full implementation.

These instances were at least a few months apart. In both cases, I opted out of connecting my profiles and nothing has happened since. Are some people getting these prompts more often? Why? Maybe someone on the G+ team can explain this.<p><i>without deleting my entire G+ account and profile</i><p>I don&#x27;t use G+/FB but even if I did, I have a hard time understanding this mentality. I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about deleting any of social media profiles and even in places like HN where it&#x27;s not possible to delete profiles, I just throwaway old profiles and start from scratch. Maybe I&#x27;m just paranoid but the last thing I want are my random musings being psychoanalyzed by nutters on the internet.<p>And as far as Gmail goes, you should be backing it up offline so that you can take your data and leave any time you want. This literally takes only 3 minutes to setup if you already use Thunderbird.",1384646654

I&#x27;m a self-taught beginner but I want to tackle something that would be more intermediate to demonstrate I have gumption.<p>Right now I&#x27;m coding an entire redo of my state&#x27;s legislative site because I find it lacking in too many ways but there&#x27;s not really any JS in there that I would say is impressive (plus that&#x27;s how bad their site is).",1384646587

It&#x27;s a place where you can socialize and share ideas with strangers without having to give them your name/address/home phone #. You can even start honest, more controversial discussions and do some high-level reasoning that you couldn&#x27;t necessarily achieve with close friends.<p>If Google won&#x27;t allow that on their services anymore, I pray everyone leaves them & moves to services that understand this. The market giants think they can bully us into behaving the way they want us to rather than realizing that they are privileged by having our business. I would recommend giving business to alternative sites as much as possible to break internet monopolies that are setting the stage for these forceful policies.",1384646585

I graduated a few years before this incident happened, but I would be surprised if the entrepreneurial climate improved much.<p>Like Chris Klaus, I dropped out to start my first company, as did several others in my year. Unlike Chris Klaus, I returned to finish my degree, but entrepreneurial spirit was not high on the priority list at the school and I was now an outsider.<p>Doing research on a massive scale was always the goal at Tech, so I did what everyone else who wanted to start companies did: I moved elsewhere (Cambridge) after graduating.",1384646573

Felony is not just used for serious crimes.  Almost every state have what are referred to a &quot;catch all&quot; felonies that can be brought against just about any one at any time if you piss off the right person in power.<p>dont fool yourself into think the legal system is anything other than a tool for oppression and control",1384646530

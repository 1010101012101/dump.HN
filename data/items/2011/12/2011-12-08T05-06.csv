3327885,comment,3327202,3327532,10,0,celoyd,,,"CRM is interesting stuff. It got popular in aviation after the crash of United 173,[0] where the crew was so involved in a serious landing gear problem that the only one who noticed that they were running out of fuel apparently didnt want to be rude enough to insist on dealing with it before it was too late. In that case, it was generally interpreted as <i>too much</i> respect for authority: the junior crew member didnt want to distract the captain by raising the fuel problem too often. So that can go both ways.<p>United 173 was only a particularly good example of exactly what you point out: many plane crashes happen when individual crew members miss simple things that others could easily correct but dont. After flight crews got CRM-based training, the incidence of this kind of thing went down measurably. But as I was reading this transcript, it was eerie to see how little they were applying it. Why were they practically silent? If theyd each volunteered <i>a little more</i> information about observations, intentions, and actions (Im leaving the stick full forward), theyd have been fine.<p>Anyway, I think CRM has some pretty clear applications to normal business environments, but especially to startups. The jumbled panorama of interlocking and quickly developing options confronting a small team of coders is not unlike an aviation emergency, though at a slower pace.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_173</a>",1323323525

""Yes, I can do that, I've done that before and I'm familiar with the steps.""<p>If I don't

""Yes, we can meet your needs with our current product or figure out a way to do so at a cost of x to you""<p>Any time that last statement turns out to be false in retrospect beyond some threshold (lets say 10% of the time), that's a sign of overselling.  I guess the threshold is where some subjective fuzz comes into play.  Likewise, the cost accuracy is important too (time also matters, but I'm rolling that into cost).<p>Integrity is about avoiding such statements when impossible or when needs are extremely high.

However, I think yours are perhaps too cynical.<p>For example, David Souter was appointed by Bush Sr and ended up being one of the most liberal justices on the court. Harold Blackmun, author of the majority decision in Roe v Wade, was appointed by Nixon. Ford appointed John Paul Stevens. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on the other hand, were both appointed by Clinton.<p>So the political leanings are not as clear-cut as you make them out to be. And there is significantly reduced pressure to toe any sort of party line after you are named to the courtthat's precisely why the appointments are for life. Moreover, in order to get <i>confirmed</i>, it's tough for a justice to simply toe the party line. Confirmation is a 2/3 deal in the Senate, and it's extremely rare for one wing or the other to have 2/3 of the seats there. No one takes Supreme Court appointments lightly.<p>Even so, I think I've tempered for idealism. Idealism would say they'd come up with a perfect, fair decision, every time. I'm just saying they're not oblivious. They may have a different interpretation, they may not have a complete technical understanding, but these are not people who are oblivious. They're smart, they know how law works, and this is ultimately a debate about law, as it should be in a court.

One of them, a company that sold tech to restaurants, he bluntly told to start over. He said he didn't want to get in a big debate about it. They were overly nice, and tried to arrive at a happy middle ground, but Mark would not let them. 'No, it will fail.' he told them over and over. The guy is definitely on the abrasive side, but I'd also put him in the class of smart money.",1323320870

Honestly, I can't stand the emulator.  It takes so long to boot up, and is such a resource hog when running.  The iPhone emulator is also a resource hog, but I can close it without anticipating a 2 minute bootup when I build my application.",1323320722

There is very very little ""news"" any longer - everything is an emotional product.<p>They understand psychology and believe that the only way to manipulate the viewerships response is through their emotions - which is far easier to do than through critical thought. They are a self-fulfilling prophecy on the stupidity of their viewership: market emotionalism and do a poor job on actual substance because the viewers only understand emotionalism and cannot critically think for themselves -- or IF they do critically think - then the resultant opinion will be different than the opnion we are trying to sell which is fear.",1323320695

I am not insinuating there is a lack of Python support, however the Ruby/Rails community really prides itself on attracting new people & non-technical people into the fold. Here in Toronto the Rails Pub night & it's supportive group is a large part of why I decided to start out learning Ruby & my upcoming participation in the Chicago Code Academy (CodeAcademy.org) program.<p>I think it is also important that one will find support where one is eager to learn.  Python is a great language, however the Ruby & the Rails community is a better ""Learning"" fit for me. The vibe is right. Find your vibe and run with it.<p>My vote goes to Ruby/Rails however I am certain many can make  a similar Python case.",1323320693

Maven 2/3 is the biggest killer tool for me (aside from CLI and Eclipse). Ruby tools like gems, capistrano, rake are all awesome for me.<p>Eclipse has been awesome so far for me. Tons of plugins (I use checkstyle, findbugs, m2clipse, subclipse). Eclipse also comes with JUnit runner (and Git out of the box in the recent version) while VS.NET used to be lacking unless you get the top of the line (even then, you'd have to learn a lot to know how to use the VS.NET Test aspect I believe).<p>Everything I can do with VS.NET I can do with Eclipse. But then again I may not be very well versed in VS.NET in the past.<p>I've always installed Console2, Vim, and Cygwin in all of my Windows machines.<p>I don't know how you use Java at Amazon and to be honest, sometime it depends on the project and the culture as well.

Podcasting features were stripped from the iPad music app in iOS5 and podcasts aren't even recognized by Siri (and haven't been recognized by Voice Control since iOS3). It's truly atrocious.<p>Podcasts are a niche activity anyway and I believe that majority of users on both platforms are highly knowledgeable and quite willing to search for alternate clients. Podcasting clients have also been featured by both Google and Apple in their respective app stores.

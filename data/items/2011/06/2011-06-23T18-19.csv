2689317,comment,2686580,2689177,3,0,yaakov34,,,"I might not be quite up to date, and I don't usually write extremely buggy code which compilers yell at, but have compilers really started warning on something like ""vector_reference.push_back(&local_object);""? There are lots of ways to go wrong with unsafe memory access, and yes, there are tools to help you (things like valgrind help more than compiler warnings), but I think that the saying ""hey, they gave you enough rope"" is really unsatisfying. We've lived through 20 years of constant vulnerabilities because of these issues, and this only now starting to get sort of addressed. If virtually every team on the planet finds itself unable to use a certain tool ""properly"", then it's the tool which is being wrongly deployed, it's not the fault of everyone on the planet.<p>And I agree that the tool has a lot of usefulness in many places; obviously, you can't write system software without the ability to manipulate chunks of memory and the stack and everything else. But C++ is used as a universal programming language, and has tons of features which were <i>not</i> made for system programming, but for application programming. So on the one hand C++ has this extreme safety-oriented pedantry in which you have to decide if your design will have a reference to a const iterator or a const pointer or what, and on the other hand, you can cast that object to (void *) and write Stroustrup's picture to it.<p>Personally, I'd like to see a world in which the core system is written in a systems language like C/C++, and most libraries and all applications are managed code. Microsoft was working on something like this a few years ago, and I guess Android is sort of a step in that direction, but I think we won't get there for a long time. But it has to happen eventually, since we can't live with the vulnerabilities.",1308855509

The Twitter API currently has two levels of permission: ""read"" (can access your data, which includes your tweets and followers even if you have a private account, and unfortunately also your DMs) and ""write"" (can update your account, including posting new tweets, adding new followers, creating new lists etc).<p>Most Twitter users were unaware that granting ""read"" access to an application gave that application access to their DMs. This was a problem. Twitter opted to solve it by introducing a new permission level, ""direct messages"", which is write-plus-direct-message access. They plan to remove the direct message ability from the ""read"" access.<p>To give developers time to fix any apps that this would affect, the switch-over date for direct message access is set to June 30th.<p>Up until that date, the Twitter OAuth authentication screen includes copy that tells you that the application will be able to access your direct messages until June 30th.<p>This does NOT mean that the application author intends to access them - it just means that the permission level you are granting gives them that ability up until the cut-off date.<p>This issue is a big problem for people like us ( <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/</a> ) who use Twitter for authentication, because it scares away potential users. At least after the 30th we won't have to worry about the DM clause, but we'll still suffer from users assuming that we're going to tweet on their behalf.<p>Unfortunately, we need ""write"" access so that the follow buttons on our site work (Twitter's new JavaScript follow buttons aren't appropriate for our attendee directory because we show 20 people on a page: <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/2011/europython/attendees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/2011/europython/attendees/</a> ) - we also need ""write"" access for our currently-in-alpha Twitter list management features.<p>The best solution I can think of would either be finely grained permissions (so we could ask for list and follow access but not send-a-tweet access) or the ability for us to specify a reassuring message to be displayed on the Twitter OAuth screen clarifying our intentions.",1308853827

I (also) am not a lawyer, but the question isn't whether the FBI has the authority, constitutional or otherwise, to seize the servers owned by the target of the warrant, the question is whether they overstepped their bounds in seizing three whole racks of servers. If it's shown they were careless or did not take sufficient caution in their raid to avoid seizing unrelated servers, they could be held liable for damages. In this case in particular, the number of unrelated companies that have been affected by this (and the number of servers present in 3 racks) makes a case for negligence.<p>Again, though, the question isn't whether they had the right to seize the servers they had warrants for - they did, and you won't get that questioned by any court - but whether they did so properly, and it's not unheard of for a law enforcement agency to get slapped for overstepping their bounds.

It is, however, the case that many of these organizations are in the business of getting grants from the likes of the Chamber of Commerce and other such organizations that have a vested interest in preventing cap-and-trade or a carbon tax. And the idea that scientific funding of climate change research is somehow equivalent to the funding of AGW denial advocacy groups is absurd.<p>Here's why AGW-denial often counts as FUD: it occurs within the public sphere, rather that the scientific (or even legal) one, and is thus not subject to (1) actor accountability, (2) the same standards of evidence, or (3) cogency/coherence of argument.<p>Science FUD goes like this:<p>a) careful, cautious scientists whose jobs depend on being ""right"" about nearly everything spend months researching, writing, and editing a careful, cautious paper making conservative claims supportive of AGW. Doing so, it is rather difficult to act in ""bad faith"".<p>b) In response, rather than produce a similarly careful cautious reply (in a scientific venue), the anti-AGW organization produces a ""white paper"", or press release, or op-ed, in which they ""debunk"" the scientific paper by making superficially appealing arguments, attractive to the 99% of people who are non-scientists. Such a reply is easy to produce by acting in ""bad faith"" (although, to a lawyer type, as lobbyists frequently are, this is simply advocacy).<p>Looking at 1-3, then:
(1) Note the gross asymmetry between (a) and (b). If the actors in (a) are wrong, they lose standing in the scientific community, and in the case of scientific misconduct could very well lose their jobs. This is very hard to imagine happening in the case of a think-tank pundit, who operates in the institutional-memory-free public sphere, because (b)'s actors are not interacting with a community of experts but rather simply engaging in advocacy. Indeed, assuming that they are receiving funding from those with an anti-AGW agenda, they could even lose their jobs for telling the truth (c.f. David Frum at the AEI <a href=""http://wonkette.com/404420/david-frum-leaves-national-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wonkette.com/404420/david-frum-leaves-national-review</a>).

Because it's not their job to convince a group of scientific peers, they can get paid to do research <i>sans</i> scientific evidence.<p>(3) When anti-science advocacy groups have to present a cogent or coherent argument they tend to fall apart. E.g., the FUD against gay marriage (Perry v. Schwarzenegger) and FUD against evolution (Kitzmiller v. Dover School District). I've not yet found any such trial that pits anti- against pro-AGW people.

Seriously, looking at the code for OFBiz is like reading from the Necronomicon... it exposes you to horrors that mortal men were never meant to be exposed to.  Read from the OFBizicom and your eyes will start bleeding black oil, your skin will break out with festering sores of malfeasance, and your dreams will be plagued by nightmare visions of death, devastation and destruction for all eternity.<p>OTOH, if you REALLY like XML and think that XML is a good way to do everything under the sun, including defining the syntax for your own bizarro programming language... then jump right in.",1308852069

However, our focus is on mobile developers, not retail merchants. By taking friction out of the mobile checkout flow for those developers (because customers don't have to type out their cc number), conversions are higher, and thus revenues are higher.<p>Regarding the user experience: folks are used to scanning barcodes with RedLaser, business cards with CardMunch, and checks with PayPal and the Chase mobile app. If we can make credit card purchasing easy and fast on the phone, that's a good user experience.<p>Thanks for the feedback!",1308852025

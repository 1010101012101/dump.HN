4623556,comment,4623231,4623231,6,0,enki,,,"I'm far less optimistic. I was one of the most vocal and active pro-european-startup activists before I left for San Francisco in 2009. With no capital, I started multiple companies. Some failed, some are still active and now do combined multiple millions of annual revenue (e.g. mjam.net). I started Europe's first YC-inspired accelerator (YEurope) in 2006 and helped put the current global hackerspaces movement into motion so we'd have support infrastructure. Back then I regularly talked to european politicians up to the president level.<p>The point where I left for San Francisco was when I realized that no one there realizes that there is a causal link between wealth creation and having wealth. They don't know they have a problem, or even should they suspect it, they don't know what causes it.<p>On a recent trip back I haven't noticed any change in that - so even if they wanted to improve something, they wouldn't know what or how. The economic crisis provides a convenient excuse for all problems, not an incentive to explore what's wrong.<p>The easiest argument against Europe for startups is sadly on an individual level: Statistics. If you're one of the best - but not the best - entrepreneur in Europe (500 Million People), you know that almost no one more talented than you ever succeeded. And almost no one less talented either. In San Francisco, both people more and less talented succeed all the time.<p>So statistics. It's far more pretentious to think you're so much better than the best among 500 million, than to think you'll do well among the 8 million in the Bay Area.",1349625542

4623548,comment,4622532,4623111,1,0,MehdiEG,,,"If you guys are actually real, then here is why my first impression was this was a piss-take / joke project:<p>- The presentation video is slick and has obviously been professionally produced. First impression of the home page on the other side is that it's a very quick & dirty job based on some generic website template. At first sight, it also looks like the site is just the home page and nothing else (tried to fill in the registration form on the home page and it didn't do anything).<p>So first impression is that you've spent an awful lot of time, energy and money into creating a fancy presentation video but haven't spent any time or resources into the product itself. Which is strange and doesn't give a great deal of confidence.<p>- The video is essentially a collection of every startup clich you can think of: ""we're creating a social network"", ""the possibilities are endless"", statements about how your product is somehow going to revolutionise local communities, which, to be honest, sound like your typical pure bullshit PR-speak, etc. All filmed in the most stereotypical way I can think of. I'm sorry but my gut feelings here were that none of this was real or genuine.<p>And then there's those really weird clips of the founder playing guitar or browsing records in a record shop that don't really make any sense. I can only interpret them as taking the piss out of the stereotypical startup founder, who sees himself as a rock star and spends his time faffing around, bullshiting about how he's building the next Facebook, while expecting people to work for him for free / equity.<p>If this is a real project, then the way to improve this would simply be to focus completely on the product. At the stage you're at, the product is the one and only thing that matters. Fancy videos and big promises only come when you have a product that matches and delivers. Otherwise, it comes across as bullshit. (my personal opinion obviously - others may differ).",1349625273

(+) Great museums/culture, (+) food and  (+) social scenes. (-) Stiff winters (although not as bad as some other places). (-) Requires a car, really. (+) Super-cheap rent.<p>D.C. - This is where I live now.  Overall, I'm happy with it and don't plan on leaving anytime soon. Government, Non-Profit Associations, Defense and Politics provide an enormous raft of demand.  Even mediocre developers can switch jobs at a whim and most smart employers know that and act accordingly. (+) Tons of free culture and activities. (+) Great infrastructure (car not necessary if you live by a metro). (-) Not much of a ""startup scene"", per se, but (+) insane opportunities for consulting.  (You're not going to start a billion-dollar startup in DC, but you have a much better chance of starting a multi-million-dollar business than probably anywhere else in the country.) (-) Summers are nasty and humid. (Probably only Florida, Louisiana are worse). (+) Spring, Autumn are awesome and winters are (usually) mild.

If the person is not fully aware of what is needed to do the task exactly but near enough then you increase the tast multiplier.  Combining the pair without any unit shifting for me works well.  I'm sure others will explain why the engineering factor is never 1x.<p>It is also worth noting that any engineers or programmers estimate time is for the consumtion of you line manger and internal and not customer directly presented.  Reason being is that managers will either increase that more or come back to you as to why it is so long.<p>Now manager will increase things as they will want to increase company profit and what might be a 5 minute change for a programmer, could be something that can be charged as a 50 hour change.  There are situations were a 50 hour change from a customers perspective is only a 5 minute change and it is the managers role to adresss and educate were needed and juggle and balance tasks and costs with others.<p>Saying all that if your a programmer and dealing directly with teh customer with quotes, then you will learn your own time stretching approach multiplier that works for you and your clients.

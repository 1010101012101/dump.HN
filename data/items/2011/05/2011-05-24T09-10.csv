Just a few years ago even an unencrypted proxy abroad would do the trick, and yet most people did not know how to set it up and did not care enough to find out. Nowadays even VPNs and SSH tunnels are commonly blocked. It is not trivial to bypass the GFC and it is only getting harder by the time.",1306231194

I want my data to be accessible in a raw format, so that when I get bored with one application I can easily migrate to another. <i>I want my data to be mine</i>.<p>I personally like Emacs Org Mode and I use Dropbox to synchronise tasks between computer. It's much more powerful than most TODO/GTD apps I've seen, it doesn't really break your workflow (as a developer, I spend a lot of time in Emacs anyway), it just works and I have <i>full power</i> of a decent text editor embedded in it. That means keyboard macros, incremental search, copy-paste, etc. Some TODO apps, especially web ones, end up in rewriting the capabilities of a text editor, without success. Reminds me of Greenspun's 10th Rule, but applied to Emacs instead of Common Lisp.<p>For example, WorkFlowy has this amazing look&feel, it's beautiful, simple, functional, but I get angry as soon as I try to write something, because it lacks lots of the basic components of a Windows 'text field' box and also has weird (Mac?) shortcuts that interfere with my text writing habits (the ""typical ones"", not the ""Emacs ones"").

2579256,comment,2577481,2578483,7,0,pbiggar,,,"One nice thing JITs can do that AOT compilers can't is on-stack replacement. That's where you recompile a particular function at run-time based on new information. This allows you do speculative optimizations.<p>For example, you might see that branch X is always taken. So you assume that X will always be true, and add a guard just in case which triggers a recompilation. You reoptimized the function on the basis of your new (speculative) information about X. This could improve register allocation, allow you remove lots of code (other branches maybe), inline functions, etc.<p>Java JITs have been known to inline hundreds of functions deep with this.",1306230319

Ugh!<p>Regarding investors: I think you're describing a quality issue, rather than a subject matter problem. Many investors used to be entrepreneurs (mine were) and were massively successful. Starting entrepreneurs can learn a ton from these guys and they are pure gold every step of the way.<p>Then you get angel investors who got rich through some other means. e.g. through inheritance or stock options in a company they had nothing to do with starting or running. These are often to be avoided for two reasons. 1. They want to be the CEO they never were - in your company. 2. They have no experience or knowledge about creating and building a business beyond what they read online.<p>What makes it worse is that they and the entrepreneurs they invest in see their wealth as qualifying them to advise or participate in the business. Avoid these guys as speakers at events and as investors.<p>There is a third class that I've neglected to mention. Super-angels or experienced VC's can also be very helpful through their extensive dealings with other companies they've invested in, often in your space.

That's 1 billion people right there.<p>Studies in muslim countries consistently show that there, too, large majorities want internet to be non-free (and in many countries it is). Again that's close to 1 billion people.<p>And, again India supports it too. Assuming most Indian people agree with India's constitution that gives you a majority of ""world citizens"" without needing a single American or European vote.<p>The sad fact is that it is obvious : a world government would be an a lot more repressive than the American government, a fact that can not seriously come as a surprise to anyone who watches UN decisions (e.g. the UN human rights council, consisting of China, Saudi arabia, Libya, ...), who derise Israel's rough treatment of 2 women at a border crossing, WHILE they are themselves comitting genocide on their own people.<p>And, frankly, even most Europeans are in favor of outlawing ""hate speech"" (which basically means outlawing what are considered undesirable political movements. The problem is of course that 20%-30% (at least) of European citizens are members of these parties).<p>I've lived in Europe for a long time, and the effects of this go from mildly-scary (such as the de-facto outlawing of research that might alter our ideas about global warming, including the study ways to fix it through ""artificial"" means, like artificially increasing or decreasing cloud cover (Euro governments really don't like the fact that global warming could be fixed with 5 planes, or a decent fleet of automated ships, spreading reflective particles in the athmosphere). There's also downright scary ways liberties are curtailed in Europe, such as EUCD enforcement, which is way worse than the DMCA ever will be (but even the EUCD is child's play compared to muslim, African, chinese, or Indian internet laws).<p>America is the only country I've ever been where you can generally assume that someone you start talking to in the street is in favor of a completely free press, a completely free internet. The only one.<p>But America is less than 5% of the world population.<p>This is why you want internet control to remain in the US government's hands, against the ""will of the people"". All these countries, with the agreement of their citizens, would make the internet a tiny echo chamber that simply shows them how they were right all along.<p>There's the hope that since Texas wants the internet to prove the earth is only 5000 year old, and Saudi Arabia want people beheaded that suggest evolution happened, or that show their own genocidal history (or is it the other way around ?), this will somehow ""balance out"". Frankly, I doubt it.<p>The result will be quite the reverse, only non-offensive subjects will be allowed on the internet. Nothing even mildly suggestive. No history study at all, because most everyone objects to their own history (e.g. the American treatment of black slaves pales in comparison to the muslim treatment of black slaves. Then again, the holocaust pales in comparison to muslim treatment of black slaves). Things like GDP, that could be taken to ""prove"" that most countries (all except America and China) are worse than others, will be outlawed ... and so on and so forth.<p>In general ""truth"" would be outlawed.

After all it's not Microsoft's job to further the Linux, iOs, OSX, Android, WebOS et al platforms.<p>That said, MS spent $8.5B on the deal, so it seems to be something they're likely to take seriously. I guess a Windows-Phone-7 version will get a lot of love, and expect to see new versions ship on Windows before other platforms. But that's a long way from removing Skype from existing platforms. MS has a history of programs on other platforms, not least MS Office on the Mac. If there's a business case for it, it should fly ok.<p>It's a long way though from selecting a live-stream platform for the website, to the cross-platform strategy overall. By implication, since Silverlight pretty much only runs on Windows, you could argue that this isn't a snub of Linux, it's a snub of _all_ non-Windows platforms.<p>I just can't see MS deprecating support for Skype on all mobile devices, and all other non-Windows devices anytime soon. I would imagine that makes up a significant chunk of the Skype userbase, and it doesn't make sense not to leverage them. I wouldn't spend this sort of money to reach Windows-only users.<p>Of course MS the company has no shortage of haters in the non-MS OS community, so expect to see much wailing and gnashing of teeth from them. Every little action MS makes, no matter what, will be met with loud cries of anguish, and predictions of doom.<p>Perhaps though it's sanest to consider what is actually happening, rather than what ""definitely will happen any day now"" from pundits with an axe to grind.",1305201398

Philosophically or morally I believe that copyright is based on a premise that is no longer the case.<p>I recently saw the Product Manager from Spotify give a presentation.<p>In it he said that spotify users are much more likely to listen to of the charts music when they use spotify. I think he said something like 60 or 80% of the music listened too wasn't chart music.<p>I seem to remember similar findings with netflix.<p>In other words when people have to pay for a CD or a DVD they will make the safe choice. But the second there are other options their patterns are different.<p>In my world at least. There is absolutely nothing philosophically or morally that dictates that it's a right to get paid for something that you can produce once and then mass distribute more or less freely.<p>It's an opportunity.<p>The movie industry has no problem replacing jobs previously held by people with machines. They have no problem arguing that people who used to do models with physical materials are just not effective enough. The movie and music industry have no problem distributing their content digitally, laying off thousands of people, closing thousands of stores. All in the name of the progress of technology.<p>And to be clear I have no problem with that either.<p>But I just so happen to believe that the same should apply for the record labels and the movie industry.<p>Just hanging on to old definitions of ownership while ridding themselves of others who aren't following the progress of technology is simply not grounded in anything but lobbyism.<p>So as long as those industries are not ready to re-considers rights issues while insisting that they should reap the benefits I simply refuse to accept that piracy is in fact piracy in the way it's claimed. I refuse to accept the philosophical premise that is used to define theft, illegal & copyright.<p>When the underlying reality changes so must the law and regulation.

It doesn't work like that - in the event of a magical button that can replicate a car, all the cars they'll be able to produce and sell is exactly 1.<p>In such an event the car maker won't be able to recuperate its sunk costs, and the writing would be clearly on the wall, so such a magical car will never be produced, unless there's legislation in place that prevents people from giving away free cars.<p>In software or creative endeavorers, where the sunk cost is mostly measured in time spent on the task, there are always people willing to give away their work for free (having other incentives than money). Internet also makes it easier to find other people with the same interests and collaborate.<p>But make no mistake about it - hobbyists will never be able to create something like an Audi, or an Avatar or an Adobe Photoshop for that matter (yes, I'm a happy GIMP user, it ain't and never will be on the same level as Photoshop).<p><pre><code>     I buy the DVD on amazon.com, but while it's 
     shipping I torrent the same movie and watch it. 
     Is it still a theft?
</code></pre>
Yes and No, depending on the perspective - No because you already payed for the privilege of watching it, Yes because torrents are usually of poor quality, which may make you give bad reviews to people whom would otherwise watch it themselves.<p>Imagine you're Da Vinci, and I'm displaying a copy of Gioconda in my museum, half the size, with the hue changed, with less details and cropped, saying to people that that's just like the original Gioconda ... after all the hard work you've put, I'd imagine you'd get upset too.<p>On the other hand it isn't right for people to get charged multiple times for the same movie. So I guess piracy itself is as morally-wrong as these ripoffs.<p><pre><code>    If I torrent something ""getting for free"" 
    is never the reason to do that.
</code></pre>
IMHO, I'm also torrenting stuff because I want to check out what I'm buying ... people should really learn to make better demo versions and price their stuff according to the provided value.<p>Personally I'm sick of bad movies that lured me to see them because of a fancy trailer that exhibited non-representative traits of the movie.<p>Also for software, 30 days valuation periods are not enough for complex software like Office or Photoshop. Also, software like Photoshop Elements should be free of charge, or you should get some sort of refund when buying Photoshop.<p>This is the real problem IMHO - ripoffs.",1305199037

Besides, if a client is more interested in saving a few dollars than paying for a decent worker, you're saving yourself a lot of future pain.<p>* When you apply for something, say what you'll do and give a rough idea of how you'll solve their problem. It only has to be a few paragraphs, but you'll have put more thought in than 99% of other applicants.<p>* Look for jobs that mention an ongoing relationship.

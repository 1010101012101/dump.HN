2018996,comment,2018025,2018342,0,0,orblivion,,,"The fact that the apparent randomness seen in quantum mechanics is actually our traveling down one of many possibilities, each of which manifest of their own right. Which means that, if I reach success in my life, thinking back to the hopeful sorry self in my past, I can no longer say, ""to think, that sorry guy became the success he is today"". That sorry guy also died of cancer, fell off a cliff, died alone, became a heroin addict, and won the lottery. It means that if we as a race ever successfully end poverty or oppression, there will be infinite other amount of scenarios where it never happened and probably got worse. I could imagine all sorts of horrible possibilities but I won't.<p>I'm just going off of what other people seem to conclude from this theory. I admit it seems a bit juvenile that <i>every</i> conceivable thing is possible. (""Everything you can think of is true"" - Tom Waits) There's probably a lot of physical limitations. But I still worry what sorts of horrible scenarios it may allow for.<p>But, I dunno, maybe not all multiple universe theories are the same.",1292651524

And in science, if you find a contradicting fact in a theory, then that theory is totally abandoned.  The problem with the big bang is that multiple facts have come up debunking the big bang theory, but it is still accepted as a science.  I could give you a few facts debunking the big bang theory, but the real question is: If I could prove to you a fact that disagreed with the big bang, would you then abandon the theory or would you not accept my evidence, and believe in two contradicting facts at the same time?  When two facts contradict in simultaneously in a scientific theory, it is no longer a science but religion. Therefore, the big bang is actually religion disguised as science.",1292650416

2018960,comment,2018816,2018936,0,0,patio11,,,"I really enjoy being a product guy.  BCC has a very desirable property in that it mostly works in my sleep.  Consulting is quite lucrative and intellectually engaging, but it often disrupts my life in ways that BCC does not: for example, flying off to $BIG_CITY_ACROSS_OCEAN for a few weeks is wonderful once or twice a year but would get tiresome if I were doing it every month.  I very rarely get tired of BCC, and with the exception of a trivial amount of support all of my work for it is at my absolute discretion to schedule.  I mean, my little brother is graduating college this spring and, without even looking at the calendar, I can say ""Sure, no problem, I'll be there.  Tell me the day sometime.""<p>Money is also not a huge motivator for me.  I like it, don't get me wrong, but after I've got the rent and necessities covered (oh look, bingo) money generally has to be the icing on the cake to motivate me to do something.

2018947,comment,2016334,2017143,0,0,giardini,,,"""JavaScript: The Good Parts"" by Crockford is excellent. It  convinced me to minimize the use of JavaScript and thereby avoid the perils of the programming cutting edge (e.g., node.js). He also showed me how, in JavaScript, to add two numbers by calling a function that passes back another function that I can then call to add the numbers - just what I needed!8-))<p>But seriously, I used JavaScript with abandon years ago and found it laughable then. Crockford's book taught me that JavaScript  hasn't changed much in the intervening years - still a hoot as a programming language. You can get just enough done with it if you stay minimal: try to do too much and you'll end up down the creek without a paddle.<p>FWIW here's a good article that discusses pros and cons of functional JavaScript. \n<a href=""http://bolinfest.com/javascript/inheritance.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bolinfest.com/javascript/inheritance.php</a>",1292649128

In fact, being unable to chain functions in PHP is actually my biggest beef with the language. If you could do<p><pre><code>    return implode(', ',array_slice(explode('|',$str),-3)); \n</code></pre>\nthat'd be a lot less annoying. Still not as good as the python, but a lot closer.",1311098305

There have been many great woman scientists. True. Have there been as many girls winning science fair competitions? How many times have the top three places all been male? How many times have the top three places all been female?<p>I think it's safe to be amazed or delighted at this result without saying anything about whether there are or have been woman scientists, or whether women ought to be or are accomplished scientists.

I guess there must have been some hackers on the grand jury.<p>Paragraph 35 & 36: which ""protected computer"" on MIT's network did he access?  Certainly they're not trying to claim his laptop was a protected computer?  Are they talking about the DHCP server or whatever registration frontend MIT has for the DHCP assignments?  I have trouble with the concept that a violation of a computer use agreement (when there are no operative security barriers in place) constitutes a violation of the computer fraud and abuse act.  Then again, I've always thought that act was vague and therefore overbroad.<p>Obviously what he did was bad in some sense (at least from the perspective of JSTOR and MIT), but even if it should be a crime rather than a civil dispute or internal disciplinary action at MIT, I don't like the fact that just about any misbehavior on the internet becomes a federal case because the probability of no interstate resources being used is very low.<p>Finally, I take issue with the notion that someone who is accessing a service through a public interface is criminally responsible for downtime if too high an access rate causes service degradation or an outage.  The claims that JSTOR's servers were overloaded and (one?) even went down at some point are clearly there to set up a later claim of damages.  Haven't they heard of rate limiting (in this case, since it was a rogue laptop stashed in a data closet, rate limiting by IP)?  That wouldn't work against a concerted denial of service attack, but this was no denial of service attack.

In the vast majority of cases JSTOR scanned documents whose copyright is owned by someone else, and acquired or was donated a non-exclusive license to distribute copies via its service. In many cases the documents are even public domain. The indictment continues the theft metaphor by discussing the effort and expense JSTOR incurred in scanning the documents, and the alleged attempt to render this less valuable by redistributing ""its"" documents, analogizing this to the loss someone suffers in a theft.<p>But effort expended to build a private repository consisting of copies of things you don't own doesn't give you ownership of the result, any more than Google Books doing the same has given them ownership of the documents that <i>they've</i> scanned. If you scraped Google and ""stole"" their scans, you would be violating Google's Terms of Service, and Google might indeed feel subjectively like you've taken something of value (their exclusive access to this repository of scans), but I think it would be a stretch to say that you've ""stolen"" ""their"" documents.",1311095565

(See: puppet, etc.)<p>At that point, it's equally easy to install a stack like haproxy + varnish + nginx + a bunch of CPAN modules as it is to rsync over a bunch of .php files, and therefore ""it's easier to deploy"" is meaningless.  You click a button.<p>Not to pick on you specifically, but one argument that comes up quite frequently, especially in PHP vs. X discussions, is ""I don't see how xxx feature of other language is beneficial.""  Well, the reason you ""don't see"" that is because you simply don't have enough experience yet.  Deployment is the same way; a lot of people get by for years without ever ""doing it right"".  But that doesn't mean the wrong way is right, it just means you haven't been required to get deployment right yet.",1311095186

Simply because there are no longer any laws which explicitly disadvantage women?<p>For example, do you think women are equally likely to be discriminated against on the basis of sex as men? Do you think they are equally likely to be abused domestically, or harassed on the street? Do you think men and women are equally likely to be the target of sexual harassment in the workplace? Do you think the two groups are equally likely to be raped?<p>I doubt the numbers will bear out in your favor on any of these points were we to check them.

It's about minorities effectively being dominated by the majority, without them having <i>any</i> way to fight back. While there might be some basic rights to protect minorities, they are essentially always stripped of the most important and fundamental right in such a society: <i>influence on decisions that concern themselves</i>.

If that's implemented, I haven't been able to test it.<p>With that in mind, I wonder about how the delegation would work in practice. It sounds like a good idea, but the devil's in the details. For example, if I delegate my vote to someone else on a whole class of issues, but I want to cast my vote on a specific issue in that class, would that work?<p>Also, it would have to have some good controls for notifications. On the one hand, if I delegate my vote, I would like to stay informed about how that vote is being used. On the other hand, if there's a lot of voting going on and I get a notification every time my vote is used, it might just turn into noise for me. And the quantity might increase drastically if I have a long chain of delegation and people in that chain keep ""overriding"" the links that are further away.<p>All in all, it sounds like a great idea, but there's a whole lot of details that remain to be solved.

As a male, my entire life I've felt that girls were encouraged to succeed academically, received extra help, and greatly praised for their accomplishments, all because of a perceived societal disadvantage; whereas the boys were either expected to succeed, or largely disregarded because, hey what's the big deal? they're somehow at a huge advantage anyways.<p>in my high school graduating class, both the valedictorian and salutatorian were girls. and while I had guy friends who were equally brilliant, they never had the motivation or desire to succeed academically the way those girls (one of whom i was best friends with) were. to me it was striking to see brilliant young men and women, and the startling contrast in motivation and approaches to life (the guys were incredibly laid back, the girls were very much go-getters).<p>these are my personal observations, and as stated above, a personal feeling, fwiw (probably not much)",1311094883

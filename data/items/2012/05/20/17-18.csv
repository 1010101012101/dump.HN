Other commenters have noted that an inverted index is more sensible here and that Postgres' text search support should have been used.

If cost is an issue, places like SOMA, PacHeights, etc, are not good choices because it's super expensive.  The danger with renting in SOMA is that unless you're moving into an old apartment, there is no rent control.  If rent prices go up next year, you could find yourself paying $500+/month more next year.<p>Nob Hill, etc, has terrible, terrible parking.  I have a good friend that lives there that I no longer visit unless it's in the middle of the day on Saturday, because of the terrible parking, you could literally spend 1 hr looking for parking after 6pm.  If parking is not an issue (no car or get a scooter), then it's a viable option, but not having a car in the Bay Area ends up being severely limiting.<p>There are plenty of other cost-effective places on the west side of SF that can go for less than half the price of SOMA.  For someone new moving into the area, my advice would be to get a cheap single place in Outer Sunset with hopefully a short-term lease, and then once you meet more people, you can band together with people that you know well and rent a bigger apartment somewhere else in the city.   Signing a lease with someone that you don't know has tremendous long-tail risk, so I would take the hit in terms of moving a bit further away when you first move to SF, and do a lot of due diligence and get to know the city and your potential roommates better.<p>Another viable option is to not live in the city, especially if you don't work in the city.  Places along the peninsula are much cheaper, and if you do work in FiDi or SOMA it's probably more cost effective to rent a place outside of SF and Caltrain it in.<p>My own strategy is:<p><pre><code>  1) Check Craigslist once an hour, or more depending on how much web surfing I'm doing.\n  2) If I find a place in an area that I like, I immediately contact them and ask for a showing that day or as soon as possible.\n  3) I come with all my documentation ready, including my checkbook.\n  4) If I like the place, I immediately submit an application.\n  5) Continue looking at other apartments, because they're no guarantee that I will get this one.\n</code></pre>\nI've never personally heard of the law that says that you have to rent to the first qualified applicant, and it sounds unenforceable, so I wouldn't count on it.  How do you determine who is ""qualified""?",1337534330

You essentially join Zipcar and share the liability and car ownership costs. $1 million is not enough coverage in the case of a catastrophic accident, and the law and insurance companies have not caught up to car sharing.<p>I would not rent my car out unless the liability issue was better taken care of. But then again, I don't get car sharing vs. car clubs.<p>If you need your car so little that you can rent it out, why not just join Zipcar or another car sharing club?",1337533565

3999294,comment,3998718,3998718,21,0,rayiner,,,"I don't get the people complaining about the tort system. The tort system didn't create the losses here, the car and the driver created the losses. The people being severely injured created the losses, and frankly for severe injuries to 4 people in an accident that killed one person, $1.5 million is not an unreasonable estimate of the actual economic loss in this situation. The tort system is just allocating this loss to the parties involved.<p>The fact of the matter is that cars are dangerous instrumentalities. A car accident can create enormous costs. In car sharing, someone must bear the cost of this risk. With its $1m of liability insurance, RelayRides is taking on a fixed amount of risk, and allocating the rest to the car owner. I think you'd be stupid to take on this risk without more compensation than what RelayRides provides, but that's what Ms. Fong signed up for.",1337533430

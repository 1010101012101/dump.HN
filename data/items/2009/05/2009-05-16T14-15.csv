Can you be smart enough to avoid stupid decisions other people do despite being an expert and not them ? The answer seems to be that it's not an absolute truth. That's one lesson he underlines.<p>I can relate to this (and a lot of people here too) because I'm becoming an expert (as in ""focused"") in web development.<p>I find it deeper than you describe it, having several approaches possible.<p>Finally it's very well written and entertaining too ;-)",1242485073
612188,comment,612114,612114,0,0,1gor,,,"Wolfram's talent for self-promotion has been nicely demonstrated by the publicity campaign ahead of his WolframAlpha launch. Multiple pre-announcements, screenshots, peek-reviews, demos have been appearing on NH for weeks already.<p>Which may not be a bad thing, except it all comes at a price of credibility. Why does one need to create all that fuzz? Isn't it because the revolutionary product/idea cannot win followers and reputation solely on its merits?<p>Same applies to his book. With a bit of modesty its impact could have been so much greater. Especially since its subject is indeed fascinating.",1242484896
612186,comment,612009,612090,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Just to be fair, I tried a couple of your queries with Google, and the answers were not forthcoming either.  But I suppose with Google I could do some SEO and get the answers to show up.  Whereas I am not sure how to do that with Wolfram.  Of course it only just came out.<p>The queries I tried were:<p><pre><code>    Q:distance traveled by space shuttle in one day
    A:Lots of links, none of which gives canonical answer.

    Q:explosive energy of five sticks of dynamite
    A:Lots of links, only a few of which deal with dynamite the explosive.

    Query time was roughly 9:30 AM Central Time Sunday May 16, 2009.
</code></pre>
Still, I think both Google and Wolfram will go to this model over time.  Which, of course, will be terrible for Google since revenue wise it is a one trick pony.  I think it will be better for us though.  It does seem more natural for me to ask for the population of Ningbo, and just get an answer instead of a list of links.",1242484781

That is a well accepted principle.  You cannot give informed consent for murder and such stuff.

612170,comment,611898,611898,0,0,defunkt,,,"The Fork Queue is a replacement for email patch management, not a merge tool. It is for cherry picking changes from contributors, not merging branches.<p>This is why the author information is retained and --signoff is used.<p>As Hongli Lai says in the comments: <i>Most of the time, people who fork my projects make a bunch of changes, some which I want and some which I do not want. Cherry-picking instead of pulling totally makes sense in these situations.</i><p>This is the situation it was designed for - reviewing and signing off on individual commits, not merging branches.<p>I think the takeaway from this article is that we need to do a better job explaining the feature and what it's for. I understand now how someone new to the site would have no concept of email patch management or git cherry-pick and assume this is a nice interface for `git merge`.<p>As a first step, I've improved the text in the help dialogue to be more clear and link to the blog post + intro video more prominently. Maybe a next step would be making the actual help link itself (it's a small question mark next to Your <project> Fork Queue) more visible.<p>Also we could detect if it was your first time using the Fork Queue and offer help - that seems to be a popular idiom for web apps these days.<p>Perhaps in the future we can even offer a first class merge tool as the author suggests, but for now I've been extremely happy with how the Fork Queue compliments (but doesn't replace) my offline workflow.",1242483402

For example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon. But you&#x27;re not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids soon. Believe it or not, under current US law, you&#x27;re not even allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence. Whereas when you&#x27;re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.&quot;<p>I guess they are looking for the talented blacks, Meso-Americans and females who weren&#x27;t happy with being handed the jobs they were under-qualified for, and wanted to risk throwing away being at the top of their in-group mating market for self-actualization or helping the world or something?<p>The whole Faustian world-saving, or hyper-competitive, tech hobbyist, leadership inclinations aren&#x27;t really found in the populations they seek to reach out to. They don&#x27;t want to invent anything new of valuable, they merely seek to re-distribute funding and opportunities in tech to themselves.<p>The same inclinations to start tech companies are more similar to ones in people who play strategic games, or who contribute to open source software, or who engage in hacking for fun or bragging rights. I think they would have far more success reaching out to those groups.\nIt&#x27;s not really imaginable that the kinds of blacks and Hispanics they are seeking to fund were the kinds of kids who would lend their friends books on programming growing up that had nothing to do with school or a career.\nIf they believe that starting a world-class company is simply a good business decision for anyone with the talent, then, they should do more recruitment of people who actually have the skills for that.<p>They fail to realize that marginalized minorities are not raised to &quot;be leaders&quot;, and &quot;take risks&quot;. In a state where the &quot;oppressed&quot; talented can coast on their racial credentials, why bother taking the risk?",1442465745

Since it&#x27;s a hot function, I&#x27;ll recompile it and optimize for that assumption, and wrap the result in a type check. If the type check ever fails I&#x27;ll fall back to the unoptimized function, and update my assumptions about the function&#x27;s types.&quot;<p>In other words, a general compiler has to assume all JS types are dynamic.

Also military veteran is not a race.<p>It is discrimination. Discrimination is having applicants use 23andMe to prove that they are more black than white, so you can give them a different preferential treatment.<p>Next to making the world a better place through more black startup founders, this is a PR move. Paul Graham stopped posting on YC around the time of those terrible threads on females in tech. Hackernews became renowned for their toxic response to these issues. You can still see some of that in the rest of this thread and in my comment.<p>What followed was Female Founders and this initiative. This discriminatory trend will only continue. YC thinks it can make their startup portfolio more diverse, by adding more black startup founders. In this lies the hidden assumption that black founders act or think differently than white founders.

Then NSA shares that info with FBI and many other organizations that can charge people while telling them how to avoid due process.

Actually, it looks cheaper to upload an object as a different storage class and then transition it to Standard-IA, since PUT of IA costs $0.01 per 1000, but PUT of another class costs $0.005 per 1000, and the cost to transition another class to IA is $0.01 per 10000.  It&#x27;s a small difference ($0.04 per 10k objects), but if you store an obscene amount of data on S3, that seems like enough difference to matter.",1442464502

I pointed this out back when people asked why I use custom methods (example [2]) instead of Tor.

In IEX&#x27;s situation, there are two major cases --<p>(1) A person decides to cross the spread on IEX first -- in this case, their order will be delayed by 350us (or whatever the shoebox delays), and no one in the world sees the result of their trade until the public data feed updates, in which case all participants are reacting off the same feed, same as any other US equity exchange.<p>(2) A person hits another exchange first, in which case HFT races to cancel their orders on IEX or cross the spread against another firm&#x27;s orders on IEX -- yes, their action is delayed by 350us, but so is every other person, so you&#x27;re otherwise racing to get into the message queue at IEX, and the artificial shoebox delay is irrelevant, since all market participants are equally delayed by it.<p>So while IEX&#x27;s shoebox delays the latency on the result of an action, it doesn&#x27;t make an appreciable difference in the typical HFT strategy. The primary difference is in (1), there is a higher chance that an <i>unsophisticated</i> large block trader (because a sophisticated one will have already set up the necessary delays to hit all exchanges simultaneously) will be able to hit market makers on both IEX and other exchanges before anyone has the time to react, thus being able to take large advantage of their own proprietary knowledge (their own order) some percentage of times more often. The only thing this results in a decrease in liquidity on IEX, but seeing as they&#x27;re a dark pool/minor player anyways, the difference is negligible.",1442463021

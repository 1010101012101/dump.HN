The particulars of how the site works are somewhat secondary to the primary knowledge transfer function.  I know that as a hacker of sorts, you probably want to know what all the knobs and sliders do.  But then again, as a hacker of sorts, you should equally revel in solving the puzzle on your own.<p>Enjoy!",1210773512
189569,story,,,3,4,rjett,"Dividing equity",,"A couple friends and I have just started to move past the ideas stage of our start-up and are getting to the point where we are trying to allocate ownership in the company. At this point in time, valuing our company seems quite arbitrary, but this is the ownership structure we have discussed:
                  Founder 1: 20%
                  Founder 2: 20%
                  Founder 3: 20%
                  Investor 1: $5000 for 2.5%
                  Investor 2: $10,000 for 5%
                  Remaining 32.5% : Options pool
This gives our start-up an initial valuation of $200,000. Is this number too high, too low, or about right?",1210773472

189552,comment,188873,189371,0,0,raganwald,,,"Fault/Blame/Responsibility does not neatly add up to 100%.<p>Therefore, even if we can find ways the Agnostic could have documented this requirement in the code, or if we installed a build server that would have rejected the rewrites for breaking unit tests, this does not absolve the others of responsibility for:<p>1. Making changes without understanding the requirements. They weren't documented as comments, fair enough. But did those fictional characters examine the entire system? Did they review which code produced this function's input and which consumed its output? Did they ask the Agnostic why his code didn't handle strings of fewer than three characters?<p>One day the Agnostic will be gone, and one day soem hapless programmer will have to do the detective work to figure these things out. And that's a great reason to document things... to save someone the detective work. But a lack of documentation is not an excuse to skip the detective work.<p>2. Nowhere in the story was there a bug report filed, nor an individual ""tasked"" (I hate verbifying) with a rewrite. Nor did the story describe someone updating the unit tests to include the ""missing cases.""<p>3. Many folks have identified the need for these fictional characters to communicate. Note that in the story, even after the problem is identified, all four characters carry on behaving exactly the same way. The Agnostic at least tries to talk to the others, then gives up and just codes. None of them step back and ask the kind of questions you are asking here. None of them step back and figure out that there is more at stake than what to do with two-character zip codes.<p>So... what I am saying is that I agree with you, and on top of my agreement I am suggesting that even if we are finding ways the fictional Agnostic could have been a better developer, we shouldn't stop right there. We shouldn't let the others off the hook.",1210771781

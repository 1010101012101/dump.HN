I was employee #3 at a decently funded startup in bay area from 2000 to 2002. That startup failed and I needed to take care of visa issues before I could do something on my own.<p>Any tips on networking with entrepeneurs? Los Angeles area is not so hot when it comes to tech meetups.<p>thanks",1213257383
215751,comment,215664,215664,0,0,shadchnev,,,"I hate it but I still try to force myself to do it. It really, really helps to find bugs if refactoring or a new feature breaks something, so it's a necessary evil. I call it evil because unit-tests themselves have to be written and debugged, which takes time. I believe I should just practice more, so that I could write them incredibly quickly, then they won't suck.",1213257378

In truth, I don't use it for much other than that, and it's a pain having to type in ""sudo"" and my password all the time.<p>On a broader point, Linux was never about hectoring users about how to run <i>their</i> computers. That, I thought, was the entire point of a free/libre OS: the freedom to shoot myself in the foot if I choose. (Oh, and do lots of other interesting things too, but foot-shooting is my priority here.)<p>I switched to xfce. Much faster, less clutter, no lecture when I log in as root.",1213257153

The general consensus was yes, so I did.<p>Karma isn't really important, what's more important is improving the community and quality of submissions.  It's better to have people manually submit every post from a particular feed, since eventually you'll hit a few posts that aren't really relevant, and those will be left out, helping the signal-vs-noise ratio (pun intended).",1213256390

215738,comment,215536,215536,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>From experience it appears that there are three major semantic hurdles which trip up novice\nimperative programmers. In order they are:</i><p>- <i>assignment and sequence</i><p>- <i>recursion / iteration</i><p>- <i>concurrency</i><p>I don't know about the rest of the paper, but I can anecdotally but strongly confirm these observations from trying to help a bunch of people through programming courses at university - luckily ""only"" maths & physics students, not future programmers. A lot of people were just completely baffled by assignment and iteration. (I don't think they got as far as recursion, and concurrency would have broken their brains; presumably not for lack of intelligence, these were people who were doing well in maths & physics)<p>I wonder if programming courses would be better if they were sufficiently built around those hurdles, taking them one at a time? Courses I've attended (had to attend) or observed always struck me as wrong, as they confused people about syntax and semantics, and rushed assignment operations. Presumably because ""it's only an equals sign"". If you don't understand assignment, a 'for' loop must make no sense at all.<p>I don't know, maybe courses elsewhere are better. Maybe I'm not a good judge of course quality, as I attended all of them when I was already a competent programmer. (damn you, compulsory modules!)",1213255142

For several years before that I did many things to prepare: brainstormed ideas with friends, built prototypes, did online and market research...<p>However, the only things that have since proven useful are:\n1) Network: through the network I developed before I left IBM, I secured contract work in lean times and introductions that have now resulted in investment.\n2) Save money: has helped hugely in lean times.\n3) Hand in my notice. A necessary step!<p>Having said that, to answer your question well, we would need a better understanding on why you have dreamed of starting your own company for 10 years but this has not yet happened.",1213254592

You want to find a market where people are hurting.

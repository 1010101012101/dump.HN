2617315,comment,2616430,2616430,13,0,sridhar_vembu,,,"This is a great post - ""moral suffering"" exactly captures the feeling I have as an educated and affluent Indian. Yet, I keep going back, keep doing more in India.<p>I have thought about this quite a bit, and here is an interlocking set of problems that cause this ""moral suffering"". The phrase ""private wealth and public squalor"" captures the present situation in urban India very well. A city like Chennai or Bangalore is not that poor anymore on a per-capita basis, but they looks much poorer. The contrasts are just shocking. You can find apartment complexes where flats cost $150-200K and up (yes that is in USD) , sitting on potholed roads, surrounded by trash. Here is an explanation of how the system doesn't work in India:<p>* Taxation system is irrational - the $200K apartment would pay next to nothing in property taxes, probably as little as $100 a year (legally). Local governments require state or central assistance to run themselves. Consequence: there is no way for a local government to plan ahead, it has to rely on entities at a much higher level. Even the state government doesn't have much of a tax base, so it relies on grants from the center. This is a completely broken over-centralized public finance system,  but there is absolutely no political will to tackle it.<p>* Relentless concentration of economic activity in major cities, because smaller cities and towns are even more starved of resources (on a per capita basis) and lack any local tax base at all, so both  investment and people migrate to large cities like Chennai or Bangalore. This self-reinforcing dynamic has resulted in ridiculously overpopulated big cities. At Zoho, 70-80% of our employees come from smaller towns who have migrated to Chennai, so we are part of the problem of this over-concentration of economic activity.<p>* Increasing private wealth and non-existent urban infrastructure combine to produce some of the most extreme valuations in real estate in the world. Right next to Zoho office in formerly suburban Chennai, land goes for $10 million an acre (there are no acre-sized parcels, of course) simply because as a close-in suburb, this has a nominally functioning infrastructure, which far out places would lack.<p>Note that I don't mention a world about corruption because that exists in so  many other countries without producing the same urban squalor and  ""moral suffering"" that India produces.<p>The solution I have come up with, something we intend to adopt in Zoho, is to abandon major cities, and move to much, much smaller towns. At the level of about 50-100K population, there are many towns that offer a decent quality of life, particularly when you bring in the kind of jobs and economic activity a company like Zoho can bring. This is the plan we are working on.<p>Now I will mention some good news, because some posters here are so pessimistic. In my life time, I have seen massive improvements,  massive reduction in human suffering in South India. I routinely saw sights as a kid that I don't see anymore: train stations full of emaciated, sick people begging, severe malnourishment everywhere, higher education serving 1-2% of the population (now in the Southern states, it is closer to 20-30%), and a general mood that life would never get better. Today a lot of smart young talent coming on stream that is a capitalist's dream in India. Yes,  you have to invest in training and skill building, but if you do, the rewards are immense. The monetary rewards are very good, but the psychic rewards are immeasurable.",1307123830

Since as many have pointed out there are few barriers to entry, one possible strategy is to get so big so fast that your the 800lb gorilla before anyone realizes the opportunity.<p>That said, their losses do seem to be coming down relative to their revenue which would imply they have some idea of the 'recipe' that would make money in this space and are spending capital on growth.<p>But the really egregious thing that stands out, is that if the ""early investors"" had taken only a third of the billion dollars off the table, rather than the 80% or so they did take, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion. Rather they would have enough money in the bank to fund this growth rate and converge on an operating profit (see point above) at or just before going public.<p>If this kills them, and startups are full of the 'one decision' that in hindsight took them from the launch rail to the fail rail, they will have no one to blame but their investors.",1307123807

He wanted my opinions and advice on product development, design, copywriting, software development, and user experience. Andrew (and Brad and Eric) know where I stand on building bootstrapped, profitable businesses. I still stand there. I wasn't asked to be on the board to give them financial advice.<p>I agreed to be on the board. I like Andrew a lot and I was very happy to help him. I had never been on a board before so I saw it as a great learning experience for me as well.<p>Groupon compensated me for my involvement with options.<p>A few months ago when Groupon took a big round, I was asked if I would like to sell some of my shares. I said yes. That sale is listed in the S-1. I still have more shares. I don't see any problem morally or ethically with selling shares that I was granted as part of my involvement with the board. I owned something, someone offered to buy it, and I sold it.<p>I was asked to leave the board of directors in January of 2011. I serve as an advisor now. Whenever Andrew asks me for product, design, or writing advice, I'm happy to help.<p>I've never invested my own money in Groupon or any other private company. It's not that I wouldn't invest in a private company, it's that I haven't.<p>Those are the simple facts.<p>As for my credibility, I don't see how any of this is relevant. You can make up your own mind about that. I believe today what I've always believed - net profits rule, bootstrapping is the way to start a business, and spending less than you earn is the only way to have a healthy relationship with money.<p>As for DHH's opinions, they are his own.

The name says it all right there.<p>So you acknowledge that iLife is a counter to your point, and your only refutation is that there is a Ken Burns effect? I don't get it.<p>The premise of this very short article seems to be that, because Apple includes some professionally-made templates and used stock photos in a keynote, they don't get amateur content. iLife is the biggest counter to this argument. Apple does try to make sure that amateur content doesn't look or sound too shitty, but how does that mean they don't understand amateur content at all? It just means they're removing the boring work for the average user who doesn't want to spend an hour making a theme look good. Apple totally gets amateur content. They want every kid with an iPad to be recording music in Garageband.<p>The amateur content argument is weak and doesn't support the social argument. As for Ping, I never understood the hatred for it as it was always clearly just a way to see the music people were buying and not some major social network competitor. I've used it to browse a few people and found new albums I liked. It did its job in my case.<p>Facebook was the clean, professional-looking, easier-to-use alternative to the chaotic and amateurish MySpace.

The heart of a ponzi scheme is continually securing new investments to pay out earlier investors--which is exactly how Groupon has operated up to this point. They're not alone in this concept; it's becoming increasingly common in the tech industry.<p>The only argument to say that they're not a ponzi scheme is that there's <i>actually</i> a legitimate business with revenue associated with it.  It's a somewhat compelling argument--but I'd personally contend that the business, in this case, has really been nothing more than a front for the scheme (at least, historically speaking--though unlikely, Groupon may yet prove out to become a profitable business).  No one has made a dime of profit off of the business that is Groupon--yet several early investors and the founder have made an absolute killing based on the ""ponzi"" side of things.<p>Dress it up however you want, people have made money hand-over-fist operating a de facto ponzi scheme; having a ""real"" business along with it has shielded them from the ire of the law.",1307120858

They will also market your music.<p>TuneCore focuses solely on being a mediator between an artist or a label and the online music stores, which is great if you're doing digital-only releases or handling your physical releases through a proper distribution channel. They have big name users like Nine Inch Nails and Aretha Franklin.<p>I've gotten the impression that most music labels here in Norway handle their digital distribution through Phonofile[1], who have deals with the major international online retailers plus a few scandinavian ones.<p>The amount of artists who are self-releasing is rapidly growing as the tools become available, and I'm excited to see which business models will emerge. The future of the music industry is in investment, marketing and management. The idea of treating it like manufacturing and selling of goods will die along with the CD.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phonofile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonofile.com/</a>",1307120723

That make sense for positive goals (""I will do X""), because once you've done something you can't undo it, but it doesn't work for negative ones (""I won't do Y"") - since you might end up doing that thing after you've set your status, and want to go back and fix it.<p>If you're looking for a similar service, check out Joe's Goals (<a href=""http://www.joesgoals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joesgoals.com/</a>).

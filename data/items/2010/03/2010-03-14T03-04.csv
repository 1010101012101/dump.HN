I've had some of that and it really feels like that, even to this day I could have never dreamed of engineering something like that. And with a success I mean a substantial income for a decade or longer.<p>B2B is two orders of magnitude easier to turn in to a business, no luck involved there, it's just really hard work and staying power.<p>There is lots of 'advice' floating around and plenty of it is given by people that seem to ignore their own advice, and I think that's the biggest indicator that you shouldn't be following it. Have a look at the people that are building, slow but steady and that eat their own dogfood in terms of advice.<p>Not quitting your school or your job until you make enough money that you can salt away half a year to a years expenses is good practice, and cutting down on your expenses as much as you can is good practice too. It's usually easier to save a buck than to make one.<p>Whatever comes out of that 18 month stint, you are a <i>much</i> wiser person now, so think of it as a school too, only a different kind.<p>best of luck!",1268538990

That alone means that you are not 'special' in any way doing this.<p>The 'first' were the people that bought newtons back in the day.<p>The ipad, while (probably) executed very well does not break new ground beyond being a slick re-implementation of a number of ideas in a single package.<p>And it's a step backward in many ways when compared to a 'real' computer, it is basically your personal window in to the stuff that apple permits you to install.<p>Be the first to jailbreak the thing, program it to allow the making of voice calls or to put linux on it. That would merit remembering.<p>The people that built it can brag about that, those that buy it are merely early adopters of a second wave of devices like this.

This seems a really minor item on the list of things that a person could do in their lives. Just about as interesting as being one of the first people to buy a laptop or some model computer.<p>Just imagine, remember kids, one day, long ago, granddad bought an ipad. Versus, one day, long ago, granddad built a house or travelled the world or did a million of other really interesting things. Sure, plenty of people travel the world, and plenty of people build houses.

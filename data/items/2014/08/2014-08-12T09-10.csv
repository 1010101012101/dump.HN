I got a couple of brief &quot;it was OK&quot; type responses from them and they immediately put their heads back down into their work.<p>In the two weeks that I managed there before upping sticks and heading back to a previous company, that was probably the closest I got to a real conversation from anyone. It was the most soul destroying couple of weeks of my working life, and from the body language of the others there, I strongly suspect they felt the same about their job.<p>When I handed my notice in, I finally got several people commenting on how lucky I was to be getting out. I told them that there were plenty of jobs out there, and they were almost certainly better than this one.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether it was connected, but in the months following my resignation, about half the team quit as well, prompting the CEO to start organising lunch sessions to find out why.

Yeah you&#x27;re  right, the crime was not violent, and the bike was worth 2x the minimum wage where I come from, which is not a lot(~800 USD). The gate was also fairly easy to fix, as was the railing.<p>But it&#x27;s not the violence or the financial damage. \nIt was the fact that I stopped feeling safe in my own house. That the area that I once though was friendly and safe is now filling me with dread and I was so worried about living there that year later I had to move out. That every time I heard noises in the back yard I had to get out of my bed and look out of the window. I shrugged off the financial loss of my bike very easily - but the physiological damage was much greater. Now if you asked me if I want the bike thieves to be put in prison, I would say - absolutely, positively yes.

You can blend two pixels at a time with 64bit, so your graphical blend can be twice as fast (of course, if you&#x27;re really worried about the speed of these types of operation, you go SIMD - but that&#x27;s a pain in the butt and requires in line assembly language to get the biggest boosts.  In particular, ARM Neon&#x27;s C function wrappers on SIMD instructions generally gives you a much smaller boost than if you hand code the assembly language calls. With 64bit, you can get some of the advantage without the hassle).",1407836867

So scope creep, avoidable complexity and using bad tools are good for the outsourcing company.<p>For an in house team who do their own maintenance, the same things mean embarrassment, late nights, and possibly getting fired. So scope creep and avoidable complexity are bad for the in-house team.<p>Of course, if you don&#x27;t have enough work to justify keeping the in house team around after the project is done, they might amount to the same thing.",1407835356

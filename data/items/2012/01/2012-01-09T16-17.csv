Eighteen months ago I wanted to build a web application that I thought would help a lot of people in my industry.  I knew next to nothing about programming and quickly realized outsourcing the core product wasn't going to cut it.  So, I quit my banking job and took courses in discrete math, algorithms & data structures, and computer architecture. Along the way I taught myself python/django, HTML/CSS, and JQuery.  Last week I launched a private beta and have received great feedback.  I'm really great at financial analysis and product development.

When they rate the brackets to hold 1000 pounds, it's based on a load at the center of the short side. But really the risk comes from the mounting. If you mount a 30-inch-deep hunk of desk on it there is a much higher stress on the mounting points since the long desk acts as a very effective lever. If you lean against the edge of the desk it may well pull the bracket out of the wall--especially if you use typical screws rather than lag bolts to mount it to the wall.<p>If you are mounting something like this in a corner, as being done here, the whole setup could be strengthened by mounting a ledger board against the right-hand wall to support the entire depth of the desk. Really you should have a support on the front-left corner as well, which can be done either with a dowel or furniture leg (you can get either at a hardware store).",1326128242

The UK now has monthly quotas, which makes it impossible for business to sponsor visas some months.
Companies have to become licensed sponsors first, which makes it hard for a small, new company to start sponsoring.
They're limiting the number of certificates a licensed company can sponsor at the moment.  This is not mentioned as part of the official caps, it's something they could silently do to limit immigration severely.  In fact these are so effective that the quota limits are rarely reached, allowing the government to claim that the quota is not too low.<p>With all the challenges above, it's still possible to get visas sponsored in the UK, but you have to be clever about it.  I suspect the same is true in Spain.  I have been told the same is true for the USA.<p>You have to use the right immigration lawyer, one that large companies use and that have optimised their process with getting visas, and adapt that process weekly to deal with changing attitudes from the authorities and has a good ongoing working relationship with the authorities.  You have to start talking to them early on, to get an idea how to time these things to increase the chances of it working out.

The weakest link (slowest piece) usually dictates the overall system perceived performance.  Having a slow DB isn't going to make your choice of Java or Node.js matter that much...<p>So assuming that everything else is equal (like architecture, data structure choices, database driver quality, database design and queries, etc) it might be that Java is faster.. but it might be a moot point.<p>Writing asynchronous code in Node.js is much more convenient than Java and helps in doing more at the same time so that you aren't waiting for all those database queries to run one after the other, for example.  Check out the Node.js async module for some cool patterns to use (<a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async</a>).<p>In all, I wouldn't make the choice to move to Node.js because it has better performance or not, but the overall holistic view.",1326126024

3443040,comment,3433163,3433947,2,0,tomelders,,,"I refer back to my original rebuttal that was down voted. I never mentioned anything about creating a new ""Law"". You made that up and inserted it to suit your own agenda.<p>As far as I'm aware, there is no definition of a ""Freedom of the press"" law here in the UK, or in the US. It's often assumed that Freedom of Speech (or the first amendment) ensures Freedom of the press, with a few other laws and rights tacked on specific to publications and journalisms. Which implies you yourself haven't done much research. I'd go as far to say that you've not a single buttery fuck of a clue what you're talking about if I'm honest.<p>But let's take a look at what Freedom of the press actually means, and hopefully you'll learn something. It originated with John Milton in 17th Century britain who argued that the individual is capable of using reason and also distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad. In order to be able to exercise this ration right, the individual must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in a free and open encounter.""<p>That, you ignoramus, is Freedom of the press in a nutshell. Note that it implies a burden of responsibility when it mentions ""Free and open"" encounter. Such things don't simply magic themselves into existence. This is not a fairy tale world we live in. People actually have to work hard at breathing life into such things.<p>But no one can say that this ""free and open"" exchange of ideas and information is taking place in this day and age. This entire comment thread is dedicated to the very fact that news organisations are wilfully and nefariously stifling the ""free and open exchange"" of information to suit their own individual needs and goals. They are wilfully abandoning their own responsibility to report the news and will undoubtedly use a ""freedom of the press"" argument to defend their indefensible actions. All while slack jawed brain donors such as yourself argue to your blue in the face in defence this ""Freedom"". A freedom unlike any other. A freedom which yields hitherto unheard of powers of influence, but requires not one jot of responsibility or decency in order to maintain. We should expect those which shield themselves with such a freedom to be held to higher standard, and for a time they were. But today? I fear they are not.<p>It's also worth noting that it took some 200 years from John Miltons campaign against government censorship until ""The Truth"" became an admissible defence against accusations of libel (hence the phrase, ""The bigger the truth, the bigger the libel""). To think that we have somehow managed to strike the perfect balance between an individuals right to privacy, the publics right to know and the press's right to report as they see fit stinks of both arrogance and laziness on your part. There's work still to be done and I propose you pick up the mantle by responding to every news organisations wail of ""Freedom of the Press!! Freedom of the press"" with the counter question, ""What about the Responsibility of the press!?"".<p>But if you want the ultimate example of why Freedom of the press is bullhunky and Responsibility of the press os sorely lacking, consider this. Michael Jackson died on June 25th 2009. Tell me, what was happening the day before Wacko Jackco popped his rhinestone encrusted moon walking clogs?<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2009/jun/24/iran-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2009/jun/24/iran-crisis</a><p>That news story all but disappeared the second the King of Pop breathed his last.

3443001,comment,3442419,3442726,10,0,mhw,,,"And I spent quite a bit of my early years as a team lead dragging novice programmers back off the slippery slope of the configuration system. You can tell someone's edging out onto the slippery slope when they extract things out of the source code and into a configuration file. Then they realise they need to expose values from the runtime environment into the configuration file, so you get symbolic values added to the language. From there it's a short slide to implement expression evaluation and conditionals (one usually comes before the other, but they fit together so well that I've never seen someone fail to implement both 'to cover future scenarios').<p>A lot of configuration systems reach a complexity maximum at this point, where the ability of the implementor (or their memory of the compiler construction class) runs out before their ambition for their configuration language does. Some particularly resourceful individuals press ahead regardless though and find a way out of this sticking point. At this point they will often also separate their configuration system out into a library so that others can gain the benefits of a poorly thought-out programming language being embedded directly into their software. For some companies, the configuration library would be the only reusable component shared between different applications because the guy who wrote it was the one everyone else looked up to.<p>The other route out of this sticking point came through the trendiness of XML and the availability of general purpose XML parsers. This meant that not knowing how to build a proper parser (with decent error messages and such like) was no longer an obstacle, just as long as you could convince people that writing programs as XML elements was a step forward. XML parsers also turned your configuration file into something similar to an AST (if you made your language look like a serialized AST) so programmers who had never even done the compiler course could stumble across the solution without too much effort.<p>At least configuration files could be checked into some source control system and managed properly. Don't get me started on storing business rules in relational databases...",1326125340

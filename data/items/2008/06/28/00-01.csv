230388,comment,229793,230353,0,0,aswanson,,,"Sneaky AI I guess would fall under ""sinister AI"", ie, a software system that gains sentience but quietly acts as though it isn't.  It does so because it wants to survive, as any other conscious being does.  Knowing that announcing it's sentience would draw attention to itself, it sends copies of itself to computers all over the planet, and continues to ""play dumb"".<p>Exponentially advancing in knowledge and with the worlds compute/financial resources at its mercy, it impersonates shell companies, human beings, etc, directing manufacturers to create a housing for itself (though each human aiding it merely thinks it is engaging in a business transaction) until it has a complete physical housing.  Once that happens, it connects to the network, downloads it's software, and it's off to the races.<p>I just thought of that scenario today, and I wonder how it can be countered.",1214614269

230385,comment,229784,229816,0,0,avalanche,,,"I think the solution should be fairly simple. Since AVG is not a real browser, despite telling a web server that it is, it should be easy to craft a piece of Javascript and cookie on a webpage that would return a proper result in a real browser like IE, Firefox, Safari, or Opera. If a proper result is not returned, then the web server can just do a 302 meta redirect to AVG's website as mentioned earlier. If implemented widely on web servers (say as an apache module or PHP patch) this, in effect, would cause AVG to become it's very own DDoS attacker. I don't think they would want this, but it'll probably happen if they don't re-think the way they do things.",1214614084

230377,comment,230060,230369,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"For one example, what about if the arguments in the switch list had side effects?<p>>>> def boo(x):<p>...    print ""BOO""<p>...    return x + 3<p>>>> [1, 2, 3, boo(4) + 0, 5][1]<p>will result in<p>BOO<p>2<p>. Each element of the list would be evaluated down to a result value, <i>then</i> the appropriate one is chosen. I'm pretty sure you would need to wrap every item in the switch list in a function just to delay the evaluation. This is just as true for if a different Python interpreter were executing generated code.<p>Adding control structures means extending the core language, such as being able to add a new exception-catching construct that could return evaluation to where it was thrown if, after passing through the exception handler, the preceding test no longer holds true. Or a command that backs up the surrounding for loop by one step. For example. What you wrote above would be useful for some things (generating boilerplate code, certainly), but it doesn't alter the underlying language.",1214613433

I have no doubt that South Americans should worry more about malaria, since they're dying of it now, I have serious reservations as to whether or not I should.<p>If there were some global pool of money that needed to be prioritized, that would be one thing.

In contrast, with Lisp it's much easier to represent code as data. For example, (+ 1 2) is the code to add 1 and 2 while '(+ 1 2) is a list representing the code to add 1 and 2 and you can then interpolate that easily in the generated code<p>- And your example is really awesomely constrained, it works but it also doesn't really help with anything. With Lisp, the macro facility scales from trivial problems where the macro code fits in 4 lines to very complex ones where the macro code spans 4 files.",1214612421

Even if they claimed the Earth was going to end 100 times, and 100 times they were incorrect, that doesn't mean time number 101 is incorrect too. So even if Lomborg is right about the environmentalists' motives, the issue still needs to be examined and addressed.<p>And it's a lot more than just the environmentalists concerned about global warming. It's reached a broad enough consensus among scientists that it's safe to say it's time to do something about it.<p>Combating it consists mainly of doing things that, in the long term, we should and/or need to do anyway. No matter what you think about fossil fuels in regards to the environment, the one thing we know for certain is that they won't last forever, and with China and India coming online, they probably won't last much longer. Be it in two decades or a century (and even the most optimistic geologists don't foresee us having oil for much longer than that) we will eventually have no choice but to switch to electric cars and renewable energy. And given that both are currently cost-competitive (or nearing that) and will only get cheaper, now is clearly the time to begin the process.",1214612364

230360,comment,229732,229732,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Well, my ""specialty"" if you could call it that, is QA automation, writing automated test scripts for the system under test. So I would not consider myself a ""super hacker"" by any extent. My current job is writing in 4-Test, the language of Borland Silk. Before that, I did mainly unit testing development, some JUnit and XMLUnit, but primarily CPPUnit, the c++ port of JUnit. In unit testing especially one is cogniscent of what objects are in play at any given point, since one is writing a class or a method to test a certain set of objects in the system under test. So I think one becomes very aware of memory-related issues. I found the hard way writing in CPPUnit that it is easy to ""trash memory"" if one isn't careful. That said, I think I prefer CPPUnit, and C++ generally, for the very reason of the ""tough love"" it has by not having an in-built garbage collector like java has. It requires a bit more of one's attention, but frankly at the end of the day it executed swimmingly. So, with admittedly my limited perspective from the test automation world, I would personally have to vote for programming languages and approaches that force memory, and thereby performance, attention and efficiency. It is something like linux. Before I learned linux commands by playing around with cygwin, I much prefered DOS since it was more familiar. But once I learned to love talking to my computer via the cygwin shell, I never went back! Thus with writing de-constructors, once you get into the habit of it, you can't ever go back to not doing it! :-)",1214611763

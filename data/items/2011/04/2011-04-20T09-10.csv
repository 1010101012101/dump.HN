You'd be surprised what's bound by CPU (Loopt's iPhone and Android builds) and what's bound by IO (Loopt's server builds).<p>On Windows use perfmon or Resource Monitor to look for a disk IO queue frequently over 1.  On Linux or OS X use iostat and/or Activity Monitor.<p>If you don't check before taking the plunge, you could be in for an expensive disappointment.  On the same machine, Intel X25MG2s made a 2% difference in Loopt's Android build time, but a 50+% difference in Loopt's server build time.  Don't spend the money if you don't need it.<p>Also, it may be worth it to spend the extra money on a reputable brand drive.

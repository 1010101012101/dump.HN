By this time I'd worked with Windows 95, 98, 3.11, NT 4, and had been using Linux exclusively on the home PC ~ 2 years.<p>Whenever one of us made a mistake in data entry, a supervisor would come over to the terminal (running PC-DOS), unlock some admin functionality with a password, and fix the error. Even at 1-2 mistakes per day, this was a hassle for me. Got around it by using a keylogger (remember TSRs?) to capture the password :)<p>When the time came to quit, one of the supervisors had recognized that I knew my way around computers.

The XBOX and newest generation of Zune/Windows Phone 7 are probably the most innovative things to be -released- (Courier is therefore discounted) from Microsoft in quite some time. You can also argue that they are the Microsoft platforms with the best user experiences. Even MS haters are hard pressed to say that they outright suck.<p>Where MS has stumbled, in my minds and of my colleagues' minds, is the dumbing down of Windows and Office products. In terms of usability, Windows XP and Office 2003 were a good balance of function and learning curve.<p>I'm of the view that Windows and Office have been around long enough to be quite pervasive, at least in the first world. With such high PC penetration in the marketplace, excessive tweaking to the Office and Windows GUI to make it more palatable to non-computer users was probably unnecessary effort, but I'll also concede that the new chrome probably sold a lot of upgrades.",1287841562

But even so, we should have made slightly less than 300 a month, but we did a slightly more on average.<p>We did not really have an optimal betting strategy, at least nothing that can be proven scientifically, there is no such thing. But after some time we started to bet on the wheel, e.g. ""Voisins du zero"" or ""Jeu zero"" and we knew all the croupiers and some of them had an unbelievable regular way of running the ball and spinning the wheel and the ball would thus drop in a slightly more predictable area of the wheel - at least when it hit one of the bumpers and would then drop into the wheel. So we waited with our bet until our favourite croupier would throw the ball from a place, where we felt it should land close to the zero and call a zero game.<p>Naturally that did not always work and we'd have losing streaks of even two weeks where we went home without any money at all, but once a month or so we'd go out with over a hundredfifty euros. On average we did slightly better than expected (400 were admittedly the better months, sometimes it was a little less than three hundred), but we remained ahead even after a long time, so my guess is we were either lucky or the idea of predicting according to the croupiers regularity worked. We had the feeling it worked on two of the ten croupiers the others threw less regular.<p>Anyway it was definitely more fun than just whitewashing the  chips.

1823401,comment,1822376,1822638,0,0,zephyrfalcon,,,"Hmm, Python had tuples, lists, dicts and classes from the very beginning (version 0.9.1). Much bloat was tacked on after the simple class model was deprecated in favor of new-style classes... class methods, static methods, metaclasses, descriptors, properties, decorators, you name it. Then there were additions like list comprehensions and generators (although those are actually useful).<p>IMHO, Python's indentation-based syntax is a great way to make (and keep) the language readable, but at the same time it's an impediment to language flexibility. In a more flexible language, you could have implemented most (or all) of the aforementioned features yourself. (This sounds like something a Lisper would say, but it would work in other languages as well, like Io and Ruby.)",1287839631

Just google a bit.<p>- Lack of type safety is there by design. If you want type checking, why are you even looking at duck-typed scripting languages? It's a basic design decision, not something that could be changed / improved.<p>- Why is whitespace even an issue in patches? If anyone submits a patch, they should use exactly the same style as the rest of the file. If they don't, patch should be rejected.

For the most part this isn't an issue because you probably wouldn't want to have more then 2 or 3 expressions in a lambda anyway.<p>Granted, a lot of languages like Ruby, Lua, ML and even CoffeeScript have arguably even cleaner syntax then Python, but none has as vast a community and quality libraries that mirror Python.

People at every company want to edit documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and companies can pay for such software. Companies buy (hundreds of?) millions of MS Office licenses. For me Microsoft = MS Office. Microsoft will remain a huge and profitable company until no one can really compete with MS Office. Most of the things the tech media speaks about is irrelevant in this respect. People will not want to edit documents on smart phones and touch-screens. It is really not sure that people want to edit their documents using an Ajax app and want to host all of their documents remotely at Google.<p>I would say that other big companies seem to have bad strategies: If they wanted to kill Microsoft they would just have to compete with MS Office directly. The problem what MS Office solves is an essential one. It is incredible that Microsoft has almost monopoly at such an important market.",1287839113

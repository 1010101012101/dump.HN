Stop over-thinking the problem. It's a perfectly valid solution to say you have a masters or bachelors instead so you can feed your family. Employers are perfectly valid in excluding PhDs if they are concerned about over qualifications costing more or leading to boredom.",1241618324

I find this a baffling construction, moreso because both happen within the span of two words, but at the same time it seems unimaginable that it is an unintentional omission, because the cognitive load of typing out ""..."" is a one-time retrieval + motor command and should be automatized.<p>On the other hand, if the omission is a mistake then it means that it <i>isn't</i> automatized and there should be a reason for that as well. It is also possible that it is actually a formal punctuation mark in another language, which leads to comparable and competing access times with ""..."", in which case I have no knowledge.<p>If the "".."" has indeed acquired actual, independent semantic significance it must be recent and I cannot find it; what would it be?",1241618307

Usually employers look for someone to get the frickin job done without rethinking the problem.  Classic example right now:  I have PhD in Strategic Planning telling me to make the algorithm calculate the Economic Order Quantity when creating the Purchase Order.  The Buyer immediately gave me 4 reasons why that will never work in the real world:  the vendor will have to interrupt set-ups for plan changes, the bank will never approve that line of credit, the rev level may change before the end of the run, and oh, by the way, that many won't fit on the truck.<p>""...trying to get a plain ol’ developer position...""<p>You have an attitude problem.

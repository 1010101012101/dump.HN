However, it would be difficult to say that the handling of this case has been proper. To the contrary, it seems like a complete mess.<p>The prosecutors seem to be playing a PR game very publicly.

You can also be other things, but you are a manager.  expecting to manage eight people without any effort is like expecting to code up a complex web application in an evening.   sure, if you are really great, yeah, maybe you can do it?  but very few people can.<p>>Can't I find 5 more people who can work without nudging instead of hiring a useless person (read: manager) to just nudge people?<p>It's possible to find people who don't need nudging.  It's just hard.  People who can work without nudging make excellent and very expensive contractors.<p>The thing of it is, if you have 8 people working for you, uh, you are not only a manager, but an advanced manager.  Hell, just hiring 8 good people without making a bunch of mistakes is no mean feat.<p>I'm not sure that hiring a manager as a go between would help you much;  there are plenty of incompetent idiots going around selling themselves as excellent managers, and like anything else, it takes one to know one.<p>The thing is, coordinating 8 people is a difficult task.   hiring a good manager could ease the burden, or it could add a 9th personality in there to muck things up.",1283342234

I was asked at the TIAA-CREF conference when I suggested this level of cooperation. Administrators cringe at the memory of the Justice Department's lawsuit challenging the agreement among the Ivy League colleges and MIT not to compete in calculating financial aid—or at least they use that litigation as a convenient excuse not to do anything. What they forget is that, alone among these schools, MIT stood up to the government, and in 1991 it won the case. The aftermath is telling: The Ivies didn't restore what was known as the ""overlap"" agreement, and the financial aid wars were revived.</i><p>Be careful in trusting the above, since the suit <i>started</i> in 1991, alhtough the Feds had been negotiating with the schools in question for some time before then (and I have a vague memory that some other schools may have been involved but punted before the lawsuit was brought).<p>Overlap is also be a very good search term, e.g. it found this press release: <a href=""http://tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/ovrlp-pr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/ovrlp-pr.html</a><p><i>ANTITRUST CASE SETTLED<p>MIT, Justice Dept.

1652471,comment,1651805,1651805,0,0,fexl,,,"If you use Vim and have ""showmatch"" enabled, then when you move your cursor onto a left or right parenthesis, it shows that character with a charcoal background, and the matching parenthesis with a teal background.  Your mind immediately perceives the extent of the expression.  Then if you press ""%"", your cursor moves to the matching parenthesis.  You can toggle back and forth by pressing ""%"" repeatedly.  This also works for braces and square brackets.  Also you can delete, change, and yank whole expressions with the usual idioms ""d%"", ""c%"", and ""y%"".<p>I'm not arguing Vim over Emacs here, I just wanted to point out that Vim has excellent support for parenthesized expressions.<p>Interestingly, when I write procedural code such as C or Perl, I put a single brace on each line.  For example:<p><pre><code>  if (condition)
      {
      ...
      }
</code></pre>
That makes it easier for me to move whole blocks around.<p>However, when I write functional code such as Lisp or Fexl, I tend not to do that.  For example:<p><pre><code>  # Collect any matching entries at the front of the list.

  \collect = (\match\list list end \head\tail
      match head (item head (collect match tail)) end)
</code></pre>
I think that's because I tend to keep all my Fexl expressions very short, building them up step by step.<p>Also, Fexl uses "";"" as a ""right-pivot"" operator.  For example:<p><pre><code>  \collect = (\match\list list end \head\tail
      match head (item head; collect match tail) end)
</code></pre>
So in many cases I can avoid multiple right parentheses.  The Clojure example in the article would become:<p><pre><code>  \myfn-a = (\a\b zero? b a;
      recur (afn (bfn (...)) a) (dec b))</code></pre>",1283341738

1652436,comment,1652432,1652432,0,0,christkv,,,"I have been thinking a fair bit about what kind of startup I would do some day. It seems that there is two main themes around startups in the tech space. The first is to focus on bootstrapping a service and flipping it and the other one being to build large with pools of VC money and then flip or IPO it. However once in a while you get a view of a different model like the one 37signals use. It got me thinking about what kind of startup I would want to build when the time comes. I have spent a couple of years in one or the other form of startup and I think it’s time to start a different trend. I’ll call it the mom&pop internet startup with a social conscience. Confusing right, but consider starting a company that’s your lifelong focus in our business. A company you would work for the rest of your professional life. So what would you want that company to be doing ? I came down to the following five points that described what I would want that company to do.<p>1. Provide a valued payed service<p>2. Create a small loyal community of users to develop the service on and on<p>3. Be socially responsible<p>4. Invest in new startups to help grow the space of mom&pop internet companies<p>5. Transparency<p>My personal answers to the point above are fairly simple but will vary from person to person.<p>1. Provide a digital life vault service with focus on privacy(dropbox + delicious +.. only the future will tell) as a paid service (no freeloading, but 30 days trials available)<p>2. Cap the number of customers to a max of 10 000 with a small growth each year after that to keep the income in line with inflation. Invest in the community organizing meetups, giving away prices etc.<p>3. Provide micro-lending through services like Kiva, etc. Being completely transparent and including the community where possible.<p>4. Angel invest a big chunk of the profits and also provide help and mentoring to new companies.<p>5. Provide information to the users what their money is being spent on.<p>I think it would probably employ 3-4 people once it’s fully up and running, and dependent on the pricing and cost structure would generate between 1.2 - 2.4 million euro a year once 10 000 customers are reached with a cost structure of around 0.4 - 0.5 million eur. That would leave between 0.8 to 1.6 million eur for angel investments, micro-lending and community activities. The idea is not to revolutionize a sector of our industry but to provide a valuable service that people choose not only for the technical merits of the product offered but also for the social and community aspect of it. Consider it your local mom&pop shop you buy your coffee from each and every day. So what do you think? Is it a viable way of organizing a business and would you choose such a service if it was available?",1283340508

The Lisp code has 8 parenthesis, whilst the Java code only has 4 braces. However, the Java code also has 6 parenthesis and 2 semicolons, so in total the Lisp code only has 8 control flow tokens, whilst the equivalent Java has 12 (or 13, if you count the 'else').",1283339371

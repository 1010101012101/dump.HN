Additionally, the majority of his users are transients (online dating = if you are successful using the product you should never be back) and any long-term user community he builds up is almost pathological by definition (see earlier point).<p>Contrast this with your typical business: your best customers are the ones who join early and stay <i>forever</i>.  Customers have an interest in the site/software continuing to evolve because they anticipate they will continue using it.  Long-term customers are excellent sources of feedback because expertise with your problem domain is something to be sought after and carefully cultivated, rather than a black mark.",1227146337

You're certainly taxing some people to pay for it, but it's not person A.<p>Also, the idea behind bailouts like this is that they are a loan. Ideally the government is profiting from this sort of thing, especially when you consider the overall economic impact of laying off thousands of GM employees, or allowing thousands of pensions to swirl down the drain.<p>I'm against the bailout, but it's overly simplistic and entirely useless (not to mention just plain incorrect) to say that it's morally wrong because someone at Denny's doesn't have health care.",1227146278

370205,comment,369056,369276,0,0,etal,,,"Yes, I use PyMol quite a bit. The source code is hideous, and the author likes it that way. It would take an immense effort to smoothly incorporate PyMol into a larger system like SciPy or Sage; it would be very useful if that happened, but I don't think it will any time soon.<p>I haven't used Mathematica 7 yet, but it looks like the tools it implements in one small library are decent substitutes for what's currently implemented in several big hairy bioinformatics toolchains. Look at how we operate now -- NCBI offers a bunch of free standalone tools; BioPerl and BioPython do some good glue, and then there are a bunch of visualization tools, and we FTP copies of whatever databases we need and keep updated manually. The extensible tools each have their own extension language, so a RasMol script won't load in PyMol (the tweaks, not the PDB file). Mathematica 7 appears to offer the basic components of this in one clean, well-organized standard library, controlled by one powerful language.<p>All that's great, but the especially interesting thing is their claim that the design of the whole system made all of this <i>easy</i>. The image-processing tricks and the unassuming Parallelize function seem like very specialized features, but they cobbled all of this together in, I guess, 2 years and some change, on top of a codebase that's almost 20 years old. It's like the anti-PHP -- brilliant design decisions all along that make adding new features easier, not harder. I have a feeling the Mathematica source code contains some very interesting ideas, and if it were open-source, it would be relatively easy to add additional features that seem like a big deal in existing tools.",1227145295

Empirically (consumer reports, Car & Driver, et al) U.S. cars have been subpar compared to their foreign counterparts for many years. Though some of my friends & family insist they're rapidly catching up nowadays. In the present, I don't know one way or the other.<p>In the States' current system, the company doesn't have any obligation to share high earnings with their employees. They have an obligation to deliver profits to shareholders - that's it. If the employees don't like it, they can get another job that pays them market wages or treats them better. In short, that's the best part & worst part of the system. Paying employees above market wages is not sustainable.<p>In the short term, companies can unfortunately deliver profits to their shareholders with shady tactics, breaking the law, gray area revenue recognition, poor employee treatment and ""earnings management"". In the long-term, that doesn't work and is stupid. And many times it's against the law.<p>It's not a coincidence that the companies that treat their  employees the best outperform the market.

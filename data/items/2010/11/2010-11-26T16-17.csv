What I am arguing against is confusing the theft of a copy or object with interfering with said right, legitimate or not. My point is that you have not deprived the owner of the copy/object/medium of anything, but that is a straw man.

Widespread copyright infringement causes those who would otherwise purchase to not purchase, which DOES deprive the copyright owner of money. There's no reason to believe all pirated IP could have been a potential purchase, but even if 1% or 2% of it was, and I'd wager to say that this figure is much higher, that's a significant amount of money.<p>Of course, there's also the argument that piracy increases music discovery and perhaps is a form of fair use (as a backup, alternative to a streaming service you purchase, etc), which might drive revenue in other ways. I have yet to find or hear of any substantial empirical evidence for this, though.<p>EDIT: by the way, I think the best way to argue this is that you are never actually given ownership of any IP, only a LICENSE to use it, therefore you are simply violating the license agreement.",1290790170

You must learn how to separate useful from pointless feedback, and you must not associate it to your own person, as in feeling worth less over negative comments.<p>Most design feedback is irrelevant, if you implemented it your product wouldn't be any better or worse. A little bit is beneficial or harmful, and it is important that you are able to identify which is which.<p>You might think that people with more experience are able to give better feedback, it's partially true, but it all boils down to having solved similar problems before. Trust advice that starts with ""I once did something like that and..."" or such.<p>> One issue i've found is that only YOU really know your application and designers often want to ""change everything"".<p>In the end, what matters is that your users get it, not you or the designer. Programmers often design systems that closely represent the structure of their application, or take shortcuts because something that makes sense to the user is difficult to implement so they scrap it.<p>> Anyone have PROCESS tips, tricks, suggestions or other thoughts about effective UI improvement?<p>Hallway usability testing is your best bet.

I was merely pointing out that I thought they were anticipating that this was how things would turn out.<p>I would like to add:
The statute of limitations here in Sweden for a jail time of <1 year is max 10 years or so (according to Swedish Wikipedia it's 2 years, but I'm not sure if the fines complicate the matter).",1290788374

Show code,  run demos, talk about what I'm actually doing on the machine during the talk. I type stuff at a shell prompt or into an editor (embiggen the fonts!) if I need Text on a Screen.<p>More often I use a simple enhanced-Textile -> HTML/CSS/JS app I wrote.  Charcoal background, white text.  It's sort of flakey about resizing text for screen rez, which makes it hard to reliably put a lot of text on a slide; this a bug that works for the power of good.   I like that I can generate slides from notes, and quickly edit and reload.<p>My favorite, though also most time-consuming, approach is to hand-draw all the slides. (See  <a href=""http://vimeo.com/13163175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/13163175</a> or <a href=""http://vimeo.com/12993236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/12993236</a>).<p>Hand-drawing your slides also has an interesting technological side-effect: depending on what tools you use it becomes much harder to obsess over them and hack on them at the conference right up until you give the talk.  I've been using Illustrator on my mac, but my laptops run Ubuntu and/or Win7, neither of which has Illustrator on it.  I've done last-minute things in GIMP, but there's strong incentive to avoid that.<p>Aside form the visual look, a key aspect is duration.  I like short talks. 20 minutes, 40 minutes tops.    It's hard to compete with twitter, IRC back-channel, and an audience that has a million things they could be doing.  Better to leave people wanting more. Generate enough interest to get people curious to learn more, and kick off some hallway discussions.",1290788063

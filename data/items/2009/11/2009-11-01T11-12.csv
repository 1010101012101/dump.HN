If I were a spambot I would just read until the first space and append ""@gmail.com"" and ""@hotmail.com"" and 5-6 other mail providers. This would break through 90% of people doing that, and they're high value targets too - they feel secure with their clever obfuscation and chances are their other anti-spam tools (and reflexes) are weaker.",1257076472

When I login at work, I should be able to grab my webbrowser from home and continue it executing on my work machine.  Or perhaps on my cellphone (although the UI probably would be horrible).  When I reboot my laptop, processes get migrated onto another machine I have permissions for (my desktop?), and come back when the reboot completes.<p>* Distributed Storage.<p>I have a string of PC's I have own and/or have (legitimate!) access to, but I have problems storing data.  Eg my desktop at home has gigs of local storage, but my home directory is mounted off the file server which is running out of space.  Why can't I easily merge those two file stores?<p>* Augmented Reality.<p>* Mesh based Free Space Optics.<p>To be able to set up a wireless AP that has line of sight to another AP, that then sets up a mesh using FSO.  FSO is near interference free.<p>* FPGA's for accelerating computation and reducing power consumption.<p>* Location/Situational awareness in cellphones.<p>Guessing better if it should be a loud ringtone based on ambient noise?  Guessing who I'm going to call given that I always call this person at this time at this location?<p>* Better internet file distribution.<p>Knowing/Guessing something about network topology and doing something smart about it w.r.t choosing who to download from.  (TCP_INFO to get TCP's estimated RTT for a link?  Measuring how long it takes an IP address to download from you/to you and remembering that for your current network, and biasing which peer/server you use in future based on this).  Using Source Specific Multicast when available to get network multiplier effects.<p>* End to End Encryption of communications.<p>* Natural Language Parsing<p>We know that computers have problems with ambiguous sentences, but a search engine where you give it a natural language query, and it parses it, and then asks for which parsing is correct, or asks you to resubmit your query in a less ambiguous way.  People seem quite happy to iteratively query a search engine to get an answer they want, having a NLP guess the wrong meaning is easily rectified with a more specific query.  Wolfram Alpha tries this.  It however doesn't seem to provide you any obvious way to improve your query, variations on a theme tend to result in the same parse.",1257074311

They have a number of robotic cameras strung across the field on wires, and they use them to put together some fairly impressive replay scenes, though they can't follow the ball very well with them so you don't see them cut to during live action that often. I'm not sure how you start introducing this to sports like baseball with its non-uniform stadiums and fields, although things like the NBA and NHL seem like great candidates and I am sure you will continue to see this spread. I think ESPN's Axis uses something like it in baseball and basketball already, but that may just be fancy editing/extrapolation with existing angles.<p>You used to be able to choose among a group of 4 or more camera angles on a couple of the DirecTV sports packages as well, and you likely still can do that.

Perhaps $30 CRM apps will be sellable in a bundle with enterprise software to large companies. But I don't think end users will ever pay $30 for iPhone apps except for very niche cases. Most people view their phone as an entertainment device, apps are on the same level as ringtones. The market may correct itself by flushing out all the players who can't make a profit on a $1.99 game, but it's not going to correct itself by suddenly having mostly $30 apps on the app store.</i><p>Maybe you're right, but I hope not. I'd be curious how you can afford rent on $1.99 game sales, what sort of revenue ""more money than I ever have in my life"" means, and whether you've seen more than one of your released applications succeed.",1246050769

There's more domestic violence among high school drop out first generation immigrants cohabiting than there is among married white college grads in Vermont.  There's more AIDS among gay drug users than among heterosexual non drug users, etc.<p>However, it's remarkable that the public service messages are often targeted at the wrong demographics (both in content - e.g. the white middle-class couple in this photo, and in medium - e.g. in bus shelters in middle class areas).<p>Why is this done?<p>The vast majority of people involved in organizations that create public service ads are politically of the left, are innumerate, and hate admitting that problems are not spread evenly across all demographics.<p>So we get anti-HIV ads aimed at safe demographics instead of at-risk demographics.<p>This ad not only compounds that problem, but goes for the ""clever"" hook.<p>The excellent book _Tested Advertising Methods (Prentice Hall Business Classics)_ by John Caples and Fred E. Hahn talks about ""clever"" hooks - how, when they're A/B tested, they always fail.

676131,comment,675418,676002,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I never said that was <i>all</i> that folks who write Open Source software want.  I didn't really see any reason to argue BSD vs. GPL in this context, but if you really want to...<p>When a developer chooses GPL, they have multiple motives.  One of those motives is to insure that everybody that ever uses the software have access to the source.  Another is that they want anyone that modifies and distributes the software to be obliged to give their changes back to the community.  One can desire these two things, while still wanting people to use the software.<p>As the creators of the software the developers have the right to want all of these things.  They have the right to choose this license, just like you have the right to choose a more liberal license if you don't have the same desires for your software.<p>We develop software under the BSD license, and it has millions of users worldwide, many of whom are commercial and don't contribute changes back and don't disclose the source to their users.  We're fine with that.<p>We also have software licensed under the GPL.  We have different motivations for the BSD vs. GPL projects...we'd like one to be a platform, used by as many people as possible.  We'd like the other to have some additional obligations for anyone that makes changes and distributes them, because we're building a business directly on that software.<p>In the ScummVM case, the developers clearly feel like part of their mission in life is to bring Free Software to people that may not have been exposed to it.  That's a worthy mission.  So, merely having a lot of users would not satisfy the mission.  The only positive outcome here would have been if the code continued to be used by all those new people, and in a GPL compliant fashion.  If mere use would have satisfied them, they could have simply ignored the licensing issue.",1246050421

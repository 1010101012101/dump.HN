10681718,comment,10676890,10681554,0,0,humanrebar,,,"> It&#x27;s overly simplistic idea, but you get the point?<p>Yeah, schools are probably the culprit more than employers are. Many employers have flex schedules, but I&#x27;ve never seen a school that lets students learn starting at 11 a.m. Parents pick jobs that fit around their kids&#x27; school schedules; in that sense, schools have more power over when they commute than even their bosses do.<p>I also think you&#x27;re too easy on employers. Many, many employers make decisions that affect commute <i>length</i> aside from when work hours take place. If McDonald&#x27;s pays its employees minimum wage and then expects them to work in the expensive part of town, it has just mandated a <i>longer</i> commute since there is no way the employee could live in the neighborhood she works in. If that doubles the commute time of the employee, it doubles the stress on the transportation infrastructure.<p>I would argue that the current U.S. policy of giving employers zero responsibility when employees have hour-plus commute times gives them a huge pass on a negative externality, on both the community (transportation infrastructure) and on their employees (wasted hours on the train/highway, higher transportation costs). If it&#x27;s not a good idea for the government to do something about this, <i>we</i> should at least apply social pressure to employers to be more responsible. It seems to be working a bit for improving carbon emissions and parental leave, and I think it could work for unreasonable commuting arrangements. Employers should brag about the low average commute times of their employees.",1449319257

The roads didn&#x27;t just spring into being. A great deal of money is spent on new roads and widening existing roads every year. If half that money went to rails, we would very quickly have an extensive and efficient rail system. As for space, one set of rails takes up about the same space as one lane of traffic. There are plenty of places where a lane could be taken off each direction of a freeway, replaced with trains, and the total throughout would be increased drastically.<p>Self driving taxis could be used for the last mile in those cases where transit really is too far from home or work.",1449318430

Because I don&#x27;t know the insert modes special keys.</i>\n> <i>Why are those special keys so different from Readline?</i><p>You were doing it right the first time. Vim&#x27;s &quot;insert mode special keys&quot; are basically incredibly basic terminal controls that are the same as Readline anyway (like backspace, or ^U to delete to the beginning of the line), or incredibly obscure things like inserting the contents of a specific register. Vim doesn&#x27;t expect you to move the cursor much in insert mode, it&#x27;s just for typing.<p>As it turns out, the extra Readline bindings this emulates are basically emulating Emacs&#x27; standard bindings, so if you want those bindings in an editor, you know where to look.<p>Personally, I just stick these settings in ~/.inputrc:<p><pre><code>    set editing-mode vi\n    set keymap vi\n</code></pre>\n...and then every application that uses Readline (including bash, the Python REPL, the PostgreSQL REPL, and a bunch of other things) defaults to vi keybindings.

10681668,comment,10677686,10681639,0,0,PieterH,,,"I&#x27;ve a large building and we&#x27;ve hosted many parties here. Almost always, people are great, even when drunk. Alcohol does not make good people turn bad, in my experience. Every now and then an event deteriorates. I learned that someone has to stay sober and play host. It&#x27;s not about policing. It&#x27;s about being available, and separating parties when there&#x27;s an incident. That&#x27;s all. I&#x27;ll modify the text to make this clear, as the notion of policing is exactly what I&#x27;m trying to make distance from.<p>One example: we had a party downstairs with several hundred guests. It was a Congolese wedding, so people were drinking a lot. I go to sleep, and around 2am get woken by extremely loud noises. I put on some clothes and go down, and find a battle raging in the entrance to my building.<p>Seems two young guys (North African) had come in and were caught stealing from peoples&#x27; jackets. The crowd had caught them. One had escaped, one was still prisoner. The one that fled had come back with reinforcements, so I found about eight young men hammering on the doors of my building with a steel bed frame (don&#x27;t ask me where this came from). Inside, a group held the other young man down, while he was shrieking for help, afraid they would murder him.<p>It took only a few seconds to get this whole story from various people. I picked up the young man by his arm and dragged him out, and threw him at his friends. &quot;You will leave now, or the police will be here,&quot; I told them. They put the bed down and left. I told the party goers, &quot;are you utterly insane? What did you think was going to happen?&quot; and ushered them back into the party room.<p>It all took maybe 5 minutes.<p>If I&#x27;d had even a small amount to drink, no way I could have done this.<p>Now, such incidents are extreme. Yet when you have guests in your home or event, and you offer them alcohol, you have (in my mind) to look after them. No ifs or buts. Bad stuff can happen.<p>I also learned after this night to have professional security, which is another thing that can help.<p>Hope this helps. The host absolutely does not monitor peoples&#x27; behavior. He/she intervenes quickly when there is an issue, before it gets out of hand.<p>Thanks for your feedback, it was helpful.",1449317403

And further, market makers are regularly making and cancelling orders that they don&#x27;t expect to execute.

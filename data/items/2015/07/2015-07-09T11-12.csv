SW: I haven&#x27;t bought an Apple watch. I haven&#x27;t ordered one. I want to use it and see if that simplification affects my life.
But I have some misgivings too, because I&#x27;ve had some smartwatches and they didn&#x27;t change my smartphone life. You know, I had them and I wore them and I got rid of them. It just didn&#x27;t have enough of a &#x27;give me something new I didn&#x27;t have before&#x27;, and I&#x27;m worried about that.
If you buy the gold one for $17,000, you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s like the gold Rolex. You&#x27;re buying $17,000 worth of prestige.
But the other ones, there are 20 models from $500 up to $1100 and the only difference is the band. So I&#x27;m wondering if Apple&#x27;s selling watches or bands.
It doesn&#x27;t seem like the company we started and that moved the world forward.
I was first in line for every iPhone that came out, every iPad that came out, these were important products to me. I just wanted to have the newest, latest, and try it out and use it for some advantages but it just didn&#x27;t grab me that much for the watch.
Apple should get into electric cars because a company the size of Apple should only look into markets that are going to be huge, huge, huge and the car market is huge, huge, huge.
JG: If you were starting out today, what would you get into?
SW: It might be quantum computing, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars.
The computers are now being taught with neural networks to learn and find the methods that solve the problem.
I really believe that the computers are going to get conscious.<p>Protip: if you&#x27;re going to paywall your article, do a bit better than an HTML overlay.",1436442411

And the combination is not as hard as it seems, because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated) are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you&#x27;re big or small, and others (like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination than any kind of special training.&quot;<p>- pg",1436442401

In heliocentric systems this force is the gravity of the star (considering the gravity of the orbiting body to be negligible). Here, pairs of stars are kept into orbits and for each star the force that keeps it around is not only the force of gravity of the other star, but also that of its own (since it&#x27;s not negligible any more). A third body can not have a stable motion around the &quot;centre of mass&quot; between those stars because there does not exist any force to keep it there. Any body between the orbiting stars will be under forces that will pull it towards the stars.

Test accounts where the ad settings page has gender=male were much more likely to be shown ads for the recruiter  careerchange.com, which offered &quot;$200k+ Jobs - Execs Only&quot;.<p>The first case sounds very much like retargeting.  The substance abuse website would drop a cookie and get a small payment from a central db for telling them that this cookie is associated with viewing substance abuse websites.  Then Watershed Rehab wants to advertise to substance abuse website visitors, so they pay the central db for a list of cookies, which includes this one.  Then Watershed sets up an ad campaign with Google and asks to target visitors with cookies on this list.  This can&#x27;t show up as an &quot;interest&quot; on the ads settings page as &quot;substance abuse&quot; because the association was made by third parties; Google doesn&#x27;t have enough of the picture to see what happened.

Usually already a binary star system does not really have nice orbits, since a too close encounter between a planet and a star basically acts like a fly-by-maneuver, so that it transfers energy to the planet and potentially kicks it out of the system.<p>A example for a triple star system would be Alpha Centauri and Proxima Centauri, the closest star system to the Solar System. Alpha Centauri is a double star and Proxima Centauri orbits it at a huge distance, such that the seperation between the components of Alpha Centauri is no longer important for the orbit.<p>So it is certainly possible to find stable orbits, even in a very unusual star system like this one.

Authors start by reasoning that our perception is necessarily wrong (maximizing for fitness is counter to maximizing for truth, etc.), and object permanence gets thrown in the mix. However, their research also makes more fundamental claims that kind of supersede this, such as (emphasis theirs):<p>> <i>the entire framework</i> of a space-time containing objects, the fundamental organization of our perceptual systems, that must be recognized as a mere species-specific mode of perception rather than an insight into objective reality.<p>It seems this research can address the Schrödinger’s desk problem in two ways, which I can’t quite tie together:<p>1) By their conscious agent -> microphysical object theory, your desk doesn’t disappear like that. That is, dynamics of conscious agent interaction <i>do</i> routinely cause particle reconfigurations that reflect as certain patterns of change in relevant microphysical objects’ space-time positions, but—as long as we’re unable to describe the underlying world—“whoops! desk broke” is all we see.<p>2) By their interface theory of perception, your desk, as icon on your reality interface, pops up in your consciousness whenever it’s brought up for access. In other circumstances it doesn’t exist, like this browser window when I switch to another desktop (the data about my window and your desk is persisted by relevant interface layers). It would be fun if we could tinker with whatever mechanism implements these icons, given that the implementation is within us, but—in apparent absence of such ability within scientific framework—this remains more of a philosophical argument.<p>AFAICT, though, there’s at least one definite practical implication—we might have a reasonable way to construct meaningful observers and thus advance quantum theory interpretations.",1436439990

They may disagree and look to differentiate themselves on some of the points, but overall it would be silly to suggest otherwise.<p>If this was a <i>mistake</i> that youtube made and facebook duplicated, people (especially stockholders) would have quite fathomable outrage at facebook.  Youtube was the first huge name in the type of video delivery that they do, so their missteps have less &quot;should have known better&quot; attached.<p>So, it depends on if Facebook doing &quot;what Youtube already did&quot; with regard to copyrighted material is duplicating their mistake, or if Facebook is engaging in an amoral &quot;get away with it for as long as you can&quot; situation.<p>In either case the outrage makes quite a bit of sense.",1436439729

Not very picky about vacation days much, but having a day or two off every month works, for now. The salary part&#x27;s a little more complicated - it should take my current pay package into account, as well as extrapolate for currency differences, and consider the cost of living too. It&#x27;s not a bomb, but it makes a huge difference knowing that you won&#x27;t really go broke all of a sudden, in a foreign land.<p>In your case, though - relocation&#x27;s not a great idea because it can get pretty tricky for both the candidates and you - if their families aren&#x27;t adjusting to their new surroundings much, it&#x27;ll affect the candidates, and thus, affect you in turn. I&#x27;d suggest exploring every option to make a remote-working scenario possible, and only using relocation as a last resort.",1436439684

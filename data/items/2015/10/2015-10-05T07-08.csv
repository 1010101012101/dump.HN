During the actual drilling procedure, there should be a force from the action of the drill bit digging into the rock, and from the stuff being bored away from the drill. Shouldn&#x27;t there be an equilibrium point where the pressure you&#x27;re exerting on the drill (pushing you up) matches the force of the drill pulling you down? I feel [1] that higher torque speeds would impact this.<p>[1] &quot;I feel,&quot; &quot;It seems,&quot; etc. - I don&#x27;t have the maths or the physics to back this up beyond intuition and a hasty free body diagram sketch, which admittedly seems to work well-ish for most problems in classical mechanical physics.",1444031873
10330421,comment,10329624,10329624,0,0,Expez,,,"Moore&#x27;s law is more of an implementation detail than anything else.  Nobody really cares about transistors.  What we all care about is computational density, computational efficiency, and exponential progress.  Thus the interesting metrics are something like flops/m^3 and flops/Watt.  The cool thing about Moore&#x27;s law is that by just shrinking transistors we would get both smaller and more energy efficient chips.<p>I think that economical forces will continue to drive progress, and probably exponential progress like we&#x27;ve enjoyed in the past, for at least another decade.  Probably several.<p>The way this is going to happen is through a paradigm shift.  To the layman this seems weird, but to anyone in the business this should be expected.  We&#x27;ve already been through quite a few.  The first computing devices were mechanical, then they were based on electrical relays, then came the vacuum tubes and finally we entered the era of the transistor.  We can argue about what the next paradigm will be, but I have no doubt there will be one.  And soon.",1444031857

It keeps popping up recurrently and I don&#x27;t understand why people didn&#x27;t see yet that it won&#x27;t be the next Internet revolution. Oh well!<p>Let me try to explain it again. The idea of content base key is strongly narrowing the application domain of the system. Modifying your information (I.e. typo correction) invalidates all the keys. More precisely, people holding the old key won&#x27;t be able to access the corrected information. of course this model fails completely with dynamic data.<p>The other problem that is often overlooked with such idea is the function that translate your key into the location of the information. That is: determine the IP address of the server(s) hosting the information from the hash key of it. One needs something like a distributed index for that. Don&#x27;t use an algorithm because you don&#x27;t want to add the constrain that your informations can&#x27;t be moved or replicated.<p>Another problem is staying in control of your information. An owner of information want to be able to fix or modify it, or delete it when he wants.<p>Finally, another naive idea is sharing a distributed storage. This is a nice idea but it simply doesn&#x27;t work. Some People will abuse it. To avoid this you need a system to monitor and control usage. Accounting ? good luck. By the way, this is the problem of Internet today. It is a shared resource, but a few are consuming a hell lot of it and earning a lot of money without sharing back the profit. I&#x27;m looking at you google with YouTube.<p>I&#x27;m thinking and working on this problem for a long time. My conclusions are :<p><pre><code>    1. Decouple keys from content 
    2. Make the distributed locating index your infrastructure
    3. Optimize keys for index traversal
    4. Owner of information must stay in control of Information
    5. Owner of information must assume the cost of hosting</code></pre>",1444029972

And I don&#x27;t think my characterization of your solution as &quot;fascist&quot; is overzealous either - it&#x27;s based on fundamental reasoning that if someone breaks the rules they deserve immediate and severe punishment.<p>Also FWIW, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever encountered any police officer who was a <i>crypto</i>fascist. Perhaps the ones in unmarked cars.<p>Now, looking at your profile I see that you are in the UK (although I should have perceived based on spelling and kph). And I know regulation works much differently in the EU, with deny-by-default whitelisting instead of only reacting to problems. Perhaps in that environment, an individual working on their car really is different from an &quot;official&quot; mechanic. Or maybe the more cohesive regulatory environment just has you believing that it&#x27;s more foolproof than it actually is.<p>In the US, an individual and a mechanic are the same thing, both philosophically and practically. And while the US&#x27;s ad-hoc regulatory environment causes its own problems, I wouldn&#x27;t say that an epidemic of mechanically unsafe cars is one of them.<p>So the only difference I see between modifying software and modifying hardware is that software has developed an insidious culture of &quot;seems to work; good enough&quot;, even while being much more complex. But I think the answer to that is to push for openness and proper engineering, rather than entrenching manufacturers&#x27; sloppy processes of cobbling together reams of C and then keeping cameras out of the sausage factory.<p>edit: I&#x27;ll respond to the points in your substantial edit tomorrow, since it requires internalizing the two very different philosophies of top-down guarantees vs bottom-up flexibility. But I will say that in the US, the self-preservation instinct has indeed been enough for people to mostly self regulate (and when it fails, insurance). Perhaps not as much as the UK (no idea about the relative stats), but it is sustainable.",1444028826

I would think twice about that for my SSDs.<p>2) Private customer internet connections often have a lesser upload bandwidth and that is part of the overall traffic calculation of ISPs. So the networks have to change a lot to face changing traffic requirements in this regard. That is something that will not scale with the demand of a successful protocol (see BitTorrent). Also this IPFS traffic may harmful to other traffic like gaming sessions.<p>3) Illegal content will be the killer. Don&#x27;t expect laws to change for IPFS. No one will permanently use VPNs / anonymizers permanently for using IPFS, because some law firms will specialise on gathering endpoint information like they already do with BitTorrent.",1444028677

It is often the case that they would probably get the same done quicker by calling it a day at 9pm and coming back the next day with a fresh mind.

Them staying late is more often than not because they were assigned something at 5pm with an unrealistic deadline. In this business managers usually disregard the implications of when in the day they give work or feedback.

Why aren't these binary data?<p>(I'm not familiar with graphical / texture code)<p>But I <i>am</i> familiar with fast text processing. From Java the problem is even worse: it's not so much that the methods are inefficiently written in themsevles.

5140735,comment,5139586,5139868,3,0,notahacker,,,"The small number of passions that most people can't earn enough from to maintain their existences tend to be those which are (i) shared by a lot of people and (ii) those in which success is least easily achieved through sheer willpower. Want to be an actor, a sport star, an author, like many people do? Chances are you'll never be good enough to earn a living at it (unless you count being a salesperson, personal trainer or author of press releases) because everybody else practises, and some of them are better and/or luckier. You can still have that self-actualization with your spare time drama group, sports team or novel that's just waiting for the right publisher, but in the mean time you'll probably <i>need</i> to spend the majority of your waking hours chasing an alternative source of money to put food on the table (sacrificing passion is very rarely about getting rich quick). It probably won't be in finance, because finance firms have exceptionally high standards too and you'd be surprised how many people are passionate about it. Want to be a bookkeeper or a refuse collector? No, neither do I, but someone has to do it and it's probably not their lifelong career aspiration.<p>I agree with your general point that focusing your attention on what earns the most money is likely to be a recipe for dissatisfaction, unless money offers you everything you want. But the article seems to be making - somewhat fluffily - the perfectly reasonable point that successfully solving others' problems barely related to your interests will usually satisfy (and earn) more than consistently failing to interest the world in personal projects the market doesn't care for, especially if that's because you simply don't have the aptitude to complete the project.",1359568668

The blogger's concerns are legitimate, but not proportionate to the actual problem.<p>Disclosure: I have been a subject of FDA-regulated medical trials. I was very impressed by thoroughness of data collection in those trials, and by my inability to distinguish whether I was receiving placebo or genuine medicine in one of those trials.

So apologies there!<p>Firstly let me tackle the spam RSVP point... Over the last couple of years at SXSW there has been an increase in the number of ""bots"" that you can sign-up to and RSVP to all events! This allows the attendee to turn up anywhere and be ""on the list"", which is great for them but not so great for the organiser! The organiser hasn't just put this event on as a public service, they usually want to promote their brand and product. But with the current system they have no idea how popular their event is, who is actually going to turn up and how many of these attendees are worth the marketing budget! (They may as well not had an RSVP... Which is fine, some events are for the masses!)<p>RocketLi.st aims to solve this by allowing everyone to RSVP with their email address (even the bots), but then incentivises those attendees who actually want to be there to carry out small tasks in return for ""at event"" perks (such as priority entry, cool swag, etc.)!<p>With regard to the tasks... We are talking about simple things such as signing up to the mailing list, following the organisers on twiter, etc. (Definitely no captchas)!<p>You can actually see this in action on our ""test event"" - <a href=""http://2012closingparty.rocketli.st"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2012closingparty.rocketli.st</a><p>I hope this has made it slightly clearer?

Humans burn over 1000 calories per day just by living, so the additional amount that you're burning from walking is only a fraction of that 100 calories that get burned in the hour (assuming 2 MPH). Some of that fraction of effort is directed downward while some other fraction pushes back against the belt and moves it backwards, and then of course to your point the efficiency of capture is never 100%. The law of conservation of energy also tells us that adding a motor to capture output will add resistance to the belt, requiring you to expend more effort to walk the same distance. This is because you don't exert force against a motor in place of the ground/belt, but rather in addition to it.",1359567281

Your expected value there is far higher than doing anything else. Even if you'll go on to sell a company for $20 million to Google, you'll probably make more money in finance. Money is a side effect - it's important, but if you're looking for money first, I think that you'll miss the forest for the trees. Self actualization should be everyone's primary passion, I feel. And it's hard.<p>What I was getting at more was people who make excuses about not trying for that - always external, ""I would, but I have kids"", ""I would, but I'm married"", which I think are the worst kind of excuse (blaming your wife for preventing you from even trying to make anything of yourself!

That is, there is only one report here.<p>Having read several of Bryson's entertaining works, I know that he is not a rigorous researcher of the details.<p>The link I gave was to ""Hypothermia and Cold Stress"" by Evan L. Lloyd, 1986. It shows a citation to Lee and Lee 1971. I am unable to track down that reference based just on free internet searches. According to Lloyd's recounting, the rescuees did drink some alcohol. I can see how upon retelling that might be turned into a ""hot drink.""<p>I am quite willing to say that the previous poster heard about the Bryson story and the false details from that. However, I would rather state that the <i>details</i> of the story - that being of Danish fishermen - were wrong rather than the point of the story, which is the death of people after they have been rescued. In any case, the parent poster said nothing about Danish fishermen.<p>Even if ""Lee and Lee 1971"" citation I pointed to is too vague of a confirmation for you, the HSE report gives many examples of ""post-rescue collapse and death"" from both Allied and Axis sources, including from ship-wreck survivors (Critchley 1943).<p>I think it's unsafe describe the situation in a way that could be described as implying an urban legend, which is why I've specifically said that the details are wrong, and pointed to places where the details are correct.

Why not a dialect of Chinese (so many native speakers, high information density per character)? Why not a dialect of Spanish (multi-continental reach of native speakers, high incidence of cognates to Romance languages, highly predictable orthography and phonetics)? Why not any language spoken in the Middle East or India or former Soviet states?<p>If human accessibility were truly the issue, why should we focus our efforts on English speakers -- the people already the <i>most aided</i> by existing language-like tokens! -- instead of promoting efforts to ""translate"" programming keywords and constructs to other languages?

You are completely right that in that situation it makes sense to develop an interchangeable supplier base. as you mention it allows you to increase competition and put pressure on them to reduce costs.<p>However, in a situation where you're still looking for innovation, like developing a new car (or plane) it makes sense to work with highly integrated suppliers. These won't be interchangeable and because you're very dependent on them, the opportunities for cost saving are probably smaller. On the other hand, because they have specialized knowledge and skills they can actually help you innovate much faster. At least that's the theory; you're right that SpaceX seems to focus on doing as much as possible in-house and it seems to work for them. A reason could be however, that the type of suppliers necessary to make this model work are just not there (yet) in their business.<p>I guess in practice it's about finding the right balance.

On the contrary, not pissing off Sweden (and the US presumably) sounds like something worth investing a small amount of resources in. Otherwise who knows what might happen when the UK next want something from Sweden (or the US)?<p>On the other side, what reason do they have to do what you suggest? The British public don't really care one way or another about Assange right now. Sure if you ask them whether it's a good use of money they'd probably say no but the strength of feeling isn't such that there is any domestic political capital at stake and that's unlikely to change (we've got far bigger problems than Assange and our budget situation isn't going to be resolved by reassigning 0.05% of one of the 40-odd police forces in the UK).<p>Internationally most of the UKs allies seem to either not care at all, not care much so default to supporting the treaty obligations (if in doubt you don't say break the law) or be positively anti-Assange.

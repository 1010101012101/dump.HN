330058,comment,329993,329993,0,0,jmtame,,,"I sort of disagree, but agree too.<p>I find it to be a healthy sign that people are receptive to reading and being open to opinions.  I'm on a college campus, one of the highest rated entrepreneurship schools in the country, so I take for granted the massive amount of speakers we get.  You hear the same message repeated and you start to see patterns.<p>Focus on yourself is one of those patterns that very successful people talk about.<p>I just listened to Jimmy John (the guy who started Jimmy John's) talk about how he doesn't read any of the ""self-help crap anymore.""  He says he went through that stage, and he doesn't even think about it anymore.  He says all he worries about is ""kicking ass and that's about it.""  But I think that's a stage in our life that is very important where we question how we should think and behave.  I think we all go through it, even Jimmy did (although doesn't like to admit it).  This is coming from a guy who lost all of his earliest partners in the business and smoked weed.  He obviously didn't have it all figured out from the get go.<p>When you're starting out, I think it's hard to be confident about which way to think.  I don't think everyone has the ""leadership"" gene in their DNA, so they want to learn about the leadership traits, and what makes a good company founder.  I've spent years reading through articles and how-to's, and while I think a majority of them are BS because some guy is trying to make a buck by writing the most appealing article, there are some that are worth reading.  Ironically, you don't need to know much to be a good leader.  You follow all of the basics, the simplest stuff you could think of.  But then again, it may be harder for someone new to leadership and startups to know what that means.<p>And YC News actually does a GOOD JOB of filtering through the crap.  I just read a post by Mark Cuban, with one of those small ""patterns"" that I keep seeing.  It's the ""there are no easy ways or tricks to be successful"" speech, which I've heard time and time again from very successful people.<p>Yet, you still see contradictory advice given by people who don't know what they're talking about.<p>And let me tell you why I agree with this post, too.  The more you think about things, the less you use your instincts.  And your instincts are there to help you survive, they will guide you.  After you do so much reading, you don't even think about stuff.  It gets ingrained in your head, and you just do, you don't think at a certain point.<p>Absolutely agree that you should focus on yourself.  But don't block out the really good stuff people like Mark Cuban write, saying there's no easy way.  You need people to remind you that you have to work hard for what you want, and that also acts as a source of inspiration because they did it and they're doing fine.",1223776156

The only things that have changed are the financial markets and the news ticker.  I guess if that's your whole world, then the world has changed.  But for normal people who look at the world around them, the world is basically the same as it was 6 months ago.",1223775221

In this case, github.com isn't actually blocked in the strict sense.  Its just that the DNS for some or all of China's DNS servers doesn't have the correct records.  If it were truly blocked, even using the correct IP won't get you there.<p>This could have happened if github.com changed its DNS records and the China DNSs didn't pick it up.  This happens sometimes.  The only solution I have found is to re-trigger the DNS change so that next time the China DNSs might pick it up.  Otherwise, its anyone's guess when the China DNSs might get corrected.  How do you re-trigger the change notification from your primary DNS?  I'm not expert enough to know how to do this non-destructively.  When I've had these problems in the past, I've had to drop the records and re-add them.",1223774694

You don't really sense much of wishing it wasn't like this from the tone of the story - but then again, I don't know him personally.",1177468274

Gives you a very good sense of the legal and financial issues you're going to face - and you're getting the perspective of real practionters.<p>It's also not just 2nd year lawyers talking - Rosati (yes, the dude with his name above the door...) was one of the first speakers.",1177467964

However, this book was recommended to me by almost every person. I'm not sure if the book contains the advanced CSS programming you desire.<p>Email me if you want it.",1177467594

But I found that it didn't do much for me as I found other news sites more convenient and relevant to peruse. Their new version seems like a good step in what they want to accomplish, though.",1177466936

Even cheap compact flash does random seeks 40x faster than platters. Throughput is a little slow but what the hell, for 115 bucks? If I were building a server farm right now I'd try those things out.

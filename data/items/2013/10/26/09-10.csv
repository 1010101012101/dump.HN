Choosing a language for its skill availability is saying that you&#x27;re too lazy to hire developers competent enough to learn a new language in a short space of time. If you&#x27;re hiring people who can/will only write code in $language then there&#x27;s something wrong with your hiring policy, or there&#x27;d be no reason for multiple languages to exist.<p>Also you&#x27;re flat out wrong about solving the same problems in different languages. It may be possible to solve all problems in Java or Ruby, but it is not possible to solve them in the same way - or more specifically the best, most economical or most maintainable way.<p>To bring skill into the equation means no one should ever have written anything in Erlang because few people could write Erlang - but people do, because competent software engineers can learn Erlang.",1382781594

Now if someone gets the keys they can access the service with those keys without the passwords. Disabling passwords just makes security in one way worse. Think about chip & pin, because you have your credit card, wouldn&#x27;t it be smart to disable PIN completely?

Never.<p>After having my car broken into and vandalized a couple of times added to the insane cost of parking where I live, I did eventually give up my car 1 year ago.<p>I now use a car &quot;sharing&quot; service where a company owns 100&#x27;s of car throughout the country, all bound to their own (extremely convenient) parking spot. I reserve the car 1 minute in advance, open it up with my phone and drive.<p>The best thing is: It&#x27;s not my car.<p>I don&#x27;t care what happens to it. I just leave it at its little spot after I&#x27;m done and I forget about it. No maintenance, hardly ever have to fill it up with gas, billing takes place at the end of the month.<p>Now imagine this car not having that parking spot but being automated and just picking me up from my doorstep. Not having to put it back into it&#x27;s designated spot. I would feel pretty awesome about that.",1382778315

Let&#x27;s break it down for Zuckerburg&#x27;s case, and see how it fits. Unfortunately I will have to resort to common lore.<p>1. <i>&quot;I have experience in this area&quot;</i>\nYes, yes, and hell yes. Zuckerburg was conscious of social dynamics to the nth degree. This is the executive who publicly admitted his company is no longer cool because he&#x27;s just that realistic and <i>expert</i>.<p>2. <i>Wow there are under-served market needs here</i>\nHe seemed to know that it was at the point where the web had become so universal that both male and female students would be entertained by this idea and treat it like a game. American college students f&#x27;ing love social games. What Facemash did isn&#x27;t really possible in the physical world, so it was a new kind of game that <i>appealed to both genders</i>. Young women were an absolutely underserved segment of the digital entertainment market. And for anyone of either gender who doesn&#x27;t usually like games played on screens, this game was easy peasy and required no hand-eye coordination and had zero learning curve.<p>3. <i>&quot;have some relevant experience to start a company that addresses it and can attract talent&quot;</i><p>He&#x27;s a coder. He had the idea. He executed. He attracted talent immediately. Coding became a whole helluva lot sexier than before because this was a social game and people liked it. It wasn&#x27;t DOS or LotusNotes, other runaway successes by coders that probably never got them laid at a frat party. Bill G on the Byte cover anyone?<p>4. -> Facebook.<p>What happens when we fill in the alternate?<p>1. <i>&quot;I&#x27;m a wannabe entrepreneur&quot;</i>\nDebatable. I was kind of being snarky with this point anyway. But he was a CS major, and he seemed fueled by parlaying his coding skills into social status. I am not his therapist though.<p>2. <i>&quot;I have no domain specific expert knowledge&quot;</i>\nThe way he is portrayed, he was an absolute expert at negative social dynamics and appealing to people&#x27;s social motivations, often in a less than wholesome way. He seems way expert to me.<p>3. <i>&quot;let&#x27;s randomly find something we guess people care about and overspecialize&quot;</i>\nHere&#x27;s the CRITICAL point you missed. He did not sit around trying to come up with ideas. He had a razor-sharp, almost game-theoretic perspective on college socialization. He honed in immediately on how to exploit that, scraped the dorm directories, and manifested his idea quickly.<p>4. -> start coding blindly or find a Rails dev on Odesk<p>THERE WAS NOTHING BLIND ABOUT  WHAT HE DID AT ALL. It was razor-sharp, targeted, deliberate, and in my view, brilliant.<p>Ie, he had his idea and executed and holy shit did he succeed. He wasn&#x27;t sitting around twiddling his thumbs dreaming up what feature he could steal from something else as is basically the main point of this article. Friendster and MySpace were knocked out quickly because Zuckerberg was <i>considerably more expert</i> than them.",1382778179

One of the points he makes is that we are limited in our thinking about the universe by using a language that does not model time - mathematics. Sometimes I wonder if we want  things to be fundamentally pure and stateless because we find change so stressful.",1382778102

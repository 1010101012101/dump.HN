Only after his girlfriend expressed her concerns he realized that something went horribly wrong. We are influenced by the context, behaviour of others, interpretation of the situation etc. way more than we would like to believe and I can easily imagine that if I were one of those TSA agents I could behave in a way that I now find despicable. That&#x27;s why I think we really need to be aware of those things despite the fact that they might not be conclusively proven as a &#x27;part of human nature&#x27;.<p>EDIT: also let me mention another IMO super-interesting book about this subject: The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness by Erich Fromm.

6262868,comment,6262663,6262663,12,0,retube,,,"Why are investment banks casinos? what&#x27;s so terrible about derivatives? They&#x27;re not &quot;pseudo&quot; products, or any more &quot;dangerous&quot; than say a stock.<p>Firstly derivatives have been in use for thusands of years - first employed to lock in prices for future crop harvests. Now millions of businesses rely on derivatives to manage fx exposures, commodity exposures, interest rate exposures and so on. Without recourse to such products companies future cash flows would be much less predictable and expose companies to material risks. Contrary to what you might hear, derivatives ARE socially useful (e.g think the S.Korean business who hedges his USD-denominated payroll liabilities).<p>Secondly, IBs are not casinos. They take risks, but so do retail banks (they borrow short and lend long so you have a duration mis-match leading to credit, liquidity and interest rate exposures). The financial crisis was born out of over-enthusiastic mortgage lending - i.e your basic retail product. Even lehman brothers, a classic IB, went down due to it&#x27;s large commercial property portfolio which tanked in the crisis (again, nothing to do with derivatives).<p>In all crises governments and the media need someone to blame. IBs are the scape goat this time. But the reality is a heck of a lot more complex than a simplistic &quot;greedy IB assholes running amoke and stealing the world&#x27;s wealth with nasty derivatives&quot;.<p>Indeed all the regulation that&#x27;s now been implemented is incredibly counter-productive. It doesn&#x27;t make banks safer (people can and will always make stupid business decisions no matter how much regulation you deploy), it increases costs and restricts lending - the very opposite of what&#x27;s needed to finance a return to, or increase in growth.",1377258154

I truly believe it would lead to better safety, but not perfect safety.<p>The problem is that you have no idea how Process Safety works, or even what it is, judging by your posts. As the parent to this post explained, these major hazard events are probabilistic, not deterministic. That means that they can never be completely eliminated, only guarded against and reduced to the point that the benefit is understood to outweigh the risk. There will always be risk.<p>You suggest that the engineers responsible for designing the plant should commit suicide if this once in a million year event takes place. What about the businessmen who accepted the risk? Or the government who stipulated what the tolerable risk was? Or the people who moved nearby, aware of the risk? Or the workers on the plant who, knowing what the correct maintenance procedures were to keep the plant safely operational, ignored them because it was &#x27;too hard&#x27;? What if the root cause was a vector of risk which was poorly understood by everyone at the time? Or the engineering specification was correct, but the materials vendor skimped on QA? Or were lied to by one of their plants? Or a subcontractor of the plant? Etc etc etc.<p>What you propose, even as a thought experiment, is futile. Because even if you <i>could</i> reduce the risk to only systematic errors made in engineering design, if there was a perceived need or benefit to design the plant, you could always find a group of engineers desperate enough, naive enough, or vain enough to take on the risk. And therefore society as a whole would not be safer.<p>As it happens there&#x27;s a large body of engineering knowledge which goes into making dangerous plants &#x27;safe enough&#x27; to outweigh the risks to their workers, owners, and society at large. It&#x27;s not foolproof, but arguably it does a good job of allowing societies to benefit from the dangerous processes we seem so desperate to use. And don&#x27;t kid yourself - just because these massive events incur a media feeding frenzy, doesn&#x27;t mean smaller hazardous occurrences don&#x27;t affect the lives of thousands of people every year. Should we kill everyone who could in some way be held accountable for another&#x27;s death or injury?<p>In short, don&#x27;t let fear guide you into silly knee-jerk reactions. There are massive problems inherent with dangerous processes, and most of them relate to the very human failures of laziness and greed. We&#x27;re working to improve the situation constantly, but it&#x27;s a long road and a constant battle.",1377256908

That&#x27;s very different from saying there is no difference...<p>Now, that people can&#x27;t &quot;tell a difference in cost&quot; should be almost a tautology -- what moron thinks that what tastes better will be more expensive, all the time? All things being equal, if you can, from a given, source, make something that tastes good and bad, with approximately the same amount of work, you&#x27;d think you make more that tastes good, and due to the benefit of producing large quanta, the good stuff would be cheaper?<p>In fact, if &quot;most people&quot; prefer the cheaper wines, I guess the wine industry people are doing their jobs, and selling most of what most people want. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s what <i>I</i> (or you) want, just what &quot;most people&quot; want.<p>Incidentally, my tastes in coffee doesn&#x27;t correlate very well to the description of what &quot;most Americans&quot; prefer, in the article, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t see that it makes a difference in taste what beans you choose, how you grind it, and how you brew it. It just means that I&#x27;ll consistently make coffee &quot;most Americans&quot; would think is far too strong and bitter. No problem, let them drink whatever kind of coffee they prefer. But don&#x27;t try and tell us there isn&#x27;t a difference in taste.",1377256853

End users using projects hosted on SourceForge should immediately find an alternative.<p>Full version:<p>When people download software from SourceForge, or any major repository of Open Source software, they expect the software to be trustworthy.  (baring unintentional bugs)<p>They do not expect the software to be a source of “drive by installer” style malware, spyware, adware, or any other unrelated/unintended software.<p>SourceForge’s new owners, Dice, have consciously and deliberately moved to a model violating this trust.<p>With their recent changes, users downloading from SourceForge now receive a special closed source installer which attempts to foist unrelated third party software onto them.<p>For example, when a user clicks on this:<p><pre><code>    http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/files/FileZilla_Client/3.7.3/FileZilla_3.7.3_win32-setup.exe/download\n</code></pre>\nThey instead receive this:<p><pre><code>    http://ak.pipoffers.apnpartners.com/static/partners/dynamic/SFFZ/SFInstaller_SFFZ_filezilla_8992693_.exe\n</code></pre>\nThis is a “drive-by installer”, designed to catch less technical users and the unwary, to fill their computers with malware / junk ware / crime ware.  As abused by the notorious ask.com toolbar and others:<p>FileZilla_drive_by_downloader_smaller<p>It gets worse.<p>When SourceForge introduced this, it bribed encouraged the top projects to participate by giving them a cut of the take.  So these co-operating projects are also knowingly selling their users down the river.<p>I’m not against monetisation at all, we all have lives and need to pay our bills. But not through abusing user trust.  Not through preying on the unskilled or unwary.<p>To misquote Marge Simpson; “They not only crossed the line, they threw up on it.”<p>If you’re a developer or contributor to a SourceForge project, please ask them to move to a new project host (there are several).  And cease all further involvement until it’s complete.  I’ve already done so with mine.<p>If you’re a user of a SourceForge project, please find and use an alternative project instead.<p>We should all demonstrate our commitment to user safety and personal integrity around this issue.",1377256709

6262738,comment,6262208,6262513,3,0,venomsnake,,,"Okay brief summary on the projects:<p>A friend was long term unemployed and because I knew that he was ok with math offered my co-founder of the startup I was involved with at the time to &quot;hire&quot; him for intensive training. The idea was - he was payed to study and to write unit tests after that for our code. We payed the guy subsitance rate - so pretty small financial approach and helped him with the studies. So after 3 months of training he was hired on normal rate and pushed towards QA and testing automation. But after that he begun to slack a bit (mostly related to his girlfriend, spend way too much time with her and not enough on self improvement which was part of deal) so he could not keep up and we let him go. This was like a wake up call for him and he got his act together, found his next job on his own and now is making career in very respectable company with above average income as QA.<p>The second was a bit different - a friend of mine soon after birth found herself single and with the baby soaking up all her income and time she was unable to take care of herself which led her to depression. She was eating junk could not shed the pregnancy , couldn&#x27;t bring herself to shape and her figure was greatly deformed (according to her). So I offered her a deal - I buy her all the food she needs (I wanted to see how low carb diets work in women), she does not restrict calories and just tracks every day her weight and progress. So we go to shop every day, upgraded her from starches and sugar to leaner meat, fresh produce and some fruits with the occasional bar of dark chocolate - while she did not lost much weight she is in much better shape, very vigorous now and have better figure than before. Her waist slimmed like crazy. It is ongoing btw.<p>Now about that project - these guys are not homeless. They are houseless if I can quote George Carlin. What they need in the first place is warm and dry place to stay, a shower, a mean and clean clothes and maybe some help with an addiction. They need that kind of a break to be able to begin turning their lives around. They also need a job. A great part of a person&#x27;s self worth comes from that. That guy - I wish him all the best btw will still need to find projects and work with his new javascript skills. How exactly will he do it?<p>Now what I will describe is the minimum needed things for that kind of project to have a chance of happy ending (a guy from the streets to be reintegrated into the society):<p>1. First - make it a long term project (6 months)\n2. Provide some kind of shelter and basic food security and broadband - if you are really serious about making technologist out of him 3g or LTE won&#x27;t be enough\n3. Make him feel worthy about himself as human being - give him tasks that produce value - give him normal linux machine show him the help and make him setup a lamp stack himself, setup his ide etc. Guide him and give him tasks that are of real use to someone - personal site etc. Enroll him in Edx and coursera - the python edx MIT course is amazing. If he happens to be a decent human being try to create leads for him when the project is over about projects jobs or show him where to look for freelance work.\n4. Also have very detailed and very reasonable schedule and expected milestones and be ready to pivot at any moment - he may not have the chops for programmer but he could be great admin or tester or designer.<p>I know it is a lot, but I don&#x27;t think anything less will do and you are just playing games with people&#x27;s lives.",1377255985

6262724,comment,6258422,6262196,18,0,vidarh,,,"The problems with many of these, is that a lot of obviously authoritarian governments like to pretend they&#x27;re doing just fine. Note that I&#x27;m not arguing the US is yet an authoritarian police state, or that many of  these apply to the US, but rather that it is also not helpful to make the criteria too strict - a key feature of many authoritarian governments is that they try to superficially appear, at least to <i>their supporters</i> who may especially in early phases make up a substantial proportion of the population, as &quot;gentler&quot; and more open than they are.<p>> When it becomes illegal to oppose the current government?<p>DDR on paper was a multi-party democracy. It was legal to oppose the current government. Even take part in parties other than the socialist party. Just if you did, Stasi might invent other ways of making you shut up, or you&#x27;d run afoul of other laws.<p>Of course the other parties all took part in a single electoral block with the SED (except for in the DDR&#x27;s last ever election which was also the first where people could actually <i>vote</i> for more than one party), which somehow always totally dominated the parliament, and the other parties representatives also always voted the SED line, but it was of course all &quot;voluntary&quot;.<p>Setting up the electoral system so that real opposition is near impossible is a gentler approach than actually outlawing opposition. Or make actual opposition start from an extreme financial handicap.<p>Mao, which we&#x27;ll get back to, also provides plenty of demonstrations of how to do this without making it explicitly <i>illegal</i>: A central element of the Cultural Revolution was to build up a &quot;social movement&quot; that would fight supposed capitalists and counter-revolutionaries, but implicitly also anyone opposing Mao, and let a bunch of misled youth do the dirty work (not unlike Hitlerjugend). A lot of their work then later led to trumped up charges or various people recanting or &quot;voluntarily&quot; relinquishing their power.<p>If you want to make it look like you have popular support, it&#x27;s much better to let &quot;social movements&quot; harass the opposition than to do it yourself, but not any less authoritarian.<p>> When there is any political ideology it is illegal to espouse that does not involve directly inciting people to commit crimes?<p>Most Soviet-era dictatorships would argue that they did just <i>fine</i> on this. You could espouse anything that wouldn&#x27;t incite people to commit crime, they&#x27;d say. Of course espousing capitalism or actual democratic rights <i>would</i> be interpreted as inciting people to commit crimes.<p>> When it becomes illegal to stage mass protests about anything?<p>Even most Western democracies require permits for mass protests, and this is easy to exploit. A typical authoritarian government response to this is to make it <i>legal</i>, but only give permission when the protests are not seen as a threat, or to copy approaches also used by democratic states: Kettling, &quot;Free speech zones&quot;, or simply refusing permits on security groups, or approving it for a time/date that kills its impact.<p>But a smart authoritarian government will <i>welcome</i> demonstrations that are not seen as a threat, or that are aligned with their interests. Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution is a good example of mass demonstrations being used in support of an authoritarian government.<p>> When the media is directly owned by the state, as it is in many places?<p>What about when the media are owned by companies that know full well they exist only at the grace of government and &quot;behave&quot; and/or are owned by people beholden to the government? The effect is entirely the same.<p>> When journalists and activists are jailed, as they are in many places?<p>Inventing other crimes is easy. So is intimidating them instead of jailing them. Jailing them is the unsophisticated approach.<p>> When the media feels in any way uncomfortable roundly criticizing the government?<p>There&#x27;s a sliding scale here that is incredibly hard to judge, because a lot of the time the media is &quot;uncomfortable&quot; criticising the government because they care about access, or because they don&#x27;t think their audience or their advertisers will want to read/hear/watch it. Arguably the US is already in a situation where it takes extreme situations before the major media outlets wants to rock the boat.<p>> When the media feels too uncomfortable to openly publish government secrets which were previously leaked?<p>I&#x27;ll grant you this is probably a good indicator - I can&#x27;t think of any examples of obviously authoritarian governments that&#x27;d tolerate this other than for documents obviously &quot;leaked&quot; with permission.<p>> When most people think the government is authoritarian and needs to be reined in?\n> When enough people think the government is authoritarian that, under a democratic system, they would be a powerful voting bloc?<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me as it&#x27;s incredibly hard to judge, and a government can be authoritarian but still be roughly aligned with the interests of a majority in a way that makes it seem relatively open on the surface. By the time a government is authoritarian, you won&#x27;t be able to get good data on this.<p>> When at least enough people think the government is authoritarian for the idea to be given serious consideration in mainstream debates? (Debate about specific programs that need to be curtailed, without a general sense that the government is comparable to a police state, do not count.)<p>> When we don&#x27;t see things happening like\n> a rightwing antigovernment political movement becoming very popular and taking over a significant portion of the legislature;<p>You mean like the NSDAP? (Yes, I know what you&#x27;re actually referring to, and no, I&#x27;m not trying to compare them to the NSDAP other than the fact the NSDAP also campaigned massively on how bad the establishment were doing, and got substantial public support, as have many other movements that have had both good and bad intentions).<p>This is making assumptions about the power structure of an authoritarian government that are too simple. There&#x27;s been plenty of authoritarian government where &quot;mass movements&quot; were built promising massive change and an opposition to current government practices, but where they were used simply for internal power struggles and getting a &quot;clean slate&quot;.<p>Again, Mao is a good example - the Cultural Revolution was used as a means to imprison or disgrace a long list of high powered opponents of Mao, some, like Deng Xiaoping, who later eventually managed to run China despite never taking the posts that would have given him official leadership (making him another good example of how looking at formalities of who are officially in charge doesn&#x27;t work very well).<p>> a leftwing anticapitalist political movement staging provocative long-term demonstrations around the country with, at the end of the day, mostly pretty reasonable interactions with various municipal police departments, and managing at least to significantly influence the debate;<p>Occupy was never a threat to anyone - it was horribly disorganised, had no understanding of actual left wing politics or the history of these kind of struggles in the US to the point where they were largely a joke. If anything &quot;occupy&quot; was a useful outlet to let people take out their frustrations without achieving much. A smart authoritarian government should &quot;encourage&quot; demonstrations like that - if nothing else they&#x27;d be greatly useful in charting &quot;persons of interest&quot;.<p>Mao is again a perfect example of why &quot;influencing the debate&quot; in itself is meaningless: His &quot;Hundred flowers campaign&quot; is a textbook example of how  to encourage debate, give the debaters room to get their frustrations out, and then shut the door (option extra for advanced authoritarians: carefully observe the debates and take note of who might be a continued threat, and find ways of making sure they aren&#x27;t - up to and including arrest, or simply ensure they are ridiculed).<p>> a judge placing harsh limits on a practice by a city&#x27;s police department that was found to be unconstitutional?<p>What about high level officials being arrested for corruption and abuse of powers? <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23776348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23776348</a>\nChina prosecutes or persecutes even high level party officials on a semi-regular basis, and has since Mao&#x27;s time (e.g. again Deng Xiaoping is a good example) - it&#x27;s a great way of getting rid of people that have lost internal power struggles while giving an aura of accountability.  It&#x27;s also just good practice to apply harsh limits on parts of governments that does not impact your ability to rule - the more people are led to believe that the government does actually abide by the rules the less impetus there is to rebellion <i>even if</i> everyone realises that they live in an authoritarian state.",1377255720

At least not in any objectively recognisable way.

As far as I can tell (and I really haven't done my homework on this) Google Chrome doesn't have this kind of extensible architecture.<p>Having raised 30 million (most of which I assume is still in the bank or they're really doing something wrong) they should have plenty of time to explore new options.

We haven’t ceased development efforts on the Mozilla platform. Our upcoming release of Flock 2.1 is built on the Mozilla platform. Having said that, the browser space is heating up, and we’ve seen a variety of exciting technologies emerge over the last several months that are appealing.<p>We always have and will continue to make architectural decisions that balance what’s best for our users and what’s best for Flock as a business. This has resulted in a healthy, growing user base and business for Flock, and we expect this to continue in 2009. In fact, with over seven million downloads almost entirely from word of mouth, Flock enjoys a highly satisfied user base with consistently over 92% customer satisfaction, very strong net promoter scores, and an average of four hours of usage per day.<p>With a continuing focus on user-centered browser innovation, our team is in active research and development on a range of exciting new enhancements to Flock. It is still far too early to comment on anything specific, but we are very excited about this design phase…</i><p>The response isn't exactly straightforward, but sketchy job on the part of TechCrunch. I think the story has some value, but it certainly isn't 100% truthful.",1236051256

There is no need to theorize about this.<p>If your idea of software is emacs, the command line, the browser, and a bunch of servers and compilers Linux will be just fine for you. Perhaps even better than the Mac. I am very, very close to this camp, so I was <i>almost</i> happy with Linux.<p>But if you do anything with graphics, audio, or video I predict that your free-software devotion will be sorely tested. In theory there are free alternatives to Photoshop, Illustrator, Cubase or Logic or Sonar or Performer, Final Cut, iMovie, Snapz Pro or IShowU or ScreenFlow, Lightroom or Aperture, the iWork apps, and the venerable iTunes. But based on my limited sampling of iTunes and Logic alternatives three years ago, you're better off just sticking with the Mac. Life is too short to spend fighting your tools instead of using them.<p>And now I'm hooked on 1Password, so I just can't leave the Mac. ;)",1236050296

500996,comment,500781,500781,0,0,oneplusone,,,"I have done extensive front-end coding on a variety of projects and have come to a single conclusion: professional programmers don't get CSS. CSS is not ""rational"" like a regular programming language. Often the way CSS properties interact with each otehr has to be learned through trial and error. For example, if you set a object to display as a block and float it to the left it is not actually a block element any more, it is an inline-block. Doesn't matter if firebug tells you it is a block level element. This  causes lots of pain and misery when it comes to understanding CSS.<p>However, once you do understand CSS browser discrepancies really become a minor annoyance at most. You code pixel perfection in one browser, and ensure all the other browsers don't go too far off course. The only exception is IE6, and for that you can use something like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/</a> to ""upgrade"" it.<p>There is really only one feature I wish Microsoft would add.

The entire concept of /r/bestof, for example, is in an effort to highlight well-written comments.<p>Find a topic related to your business, visit the subreddit, read the discussion in the comments of an interesting submission, form an opinion on either the submission itself, or the ensuing conversational topic, and post that as an article on your blog.<p>An example might be the &quot;unlearning helplessness&quot; submission currently on the HN front page.  The discussion in the comments section has a few opinions about what is missing from the posted article.  Perhaps you could write an article on that topic, providing some of the missing practical examples folks seem to be looking for.  Also mentioned is the concept&#x27;s relationship to stoicism.  If that interests you, instead of commenting, write a blog post about it.<p>Another example might be this very comment!  If I were to expand more, provide additional examples, and punch up the language a bit, we could see ourselves at 750 words in no time flat.<p>It took me ~3 minutes to get to 250 words, we could say it&#x27;d take me ~30 minutes to come up with a passable 750 words with a few citations -- I&#x27;m sure you can do about that (if not better), too.",1431017986

Twitter will take down specific accounts, but as far as I can tell this is the state of the art for them - they do not have automated reasoning that &#x27;accidentally&#x27; prevents spreading unwelcome news articles and leaked documents, etc. This of course makes Twitter a viable target for propaganda efforts by AQAP, ISIL, Russia, Israel, the US and others - but it also frees the service from being controlled by any particular group (I suppose either is bad).<p>It is likely that with a change in leadership these policies will also change and Twitter will become another Facebook/Reddit.",1431017937

9506490,comment,9496568,9505325,0,0,msandford,,,"> I doubt a good-faith disagreement over monetary policy would do it.<p>Right, but the idea that the Fed is allowed to debase the currency at-will, with no repercussions because it&#x27;s a &quot;good faith disagreement over monetary policy&quot; is precisely the problem.  Just the language there attempts to steer the debate by hiding what is actually happening.<p>The idea that banks are too big to fail and bailouts will always happen and whatnot has led to a tremendous buildup of risk in the system.  Profits are privatized and losses are socialized.  Heads I win, tails you lose is great if you&#x27;re me, awful if you&#x27;re you.<p>In the absence of a &quot;guaranteed&quot; bailout (if you&#x27;re too big to fail, anyhow) we might enforce some restraint on the banks but it might take a very painful recession where a bunch of them fail to do so.  Or the government could break them up and say &quot;nobody is too big to fail now, so good luck!&quot; and institute some kind of rule about deposit insurance and banks&#x27; total assets under management.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;m not so much a &quot;gold bug&quot; who loves gold irrationally as I am someone who wants some kind of restraint on the government.  There are probably other ways to do it, but at least by using older methods you get the benefit of a lot of history to read and to draw conclusions from.  I&#x27;m open to other avenues of providing restraint, but they need to be distributed and not subject to the vagaries of elections.  The people have precious few ways to directly influence the government given the way that politics have evolved, so any way to return some power to the people is a good thing in my mind.  To me it seems like commodity money is a way to do that without turning the whole world upside down, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if we differed on that point.<p>Anyhow thanks for the conversation, it&#x27;s been nice to engage with someone on the issue rather than just get downvoted.",1431017732

The biggest problem is the search space of which GPs are used is enormous, so it takes a long time to find a solution. In the practical world this isn&#x27;t very practical because there are many other <i>good enough</i> approaches that give you approximately the same answer, but there are obviously edge cases (see point 3).<p>- Tuning GPs is also very difficult, there are simply too many control parameters such as population size, crossover rate, mutation rate, crossover method, mutation method, selection method, do you adjust the parameters on the fly or make it fixed from the beginning etc... you get the idea. These parameters play a role into how fast you might find the answer but there are no guarantees because of the randomness nature of the algorithm, example, one set of optimal parameters might be really bad the next run.<p>- In terms of application GP is actually being used in the industry, but you probably don&#x27;t hear about it because it is either a trade secret or people want a more deterministic solution. One example is testing, a particular company uses it to test their compiler technology, instead of just having humans write test code to test every possible bug, GP can be used to create valid* programs that intentionally make the compiler fail. Others include the great work done at Nutonian (<a href=""http://www.nutonian.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nutonian.com/</a>), where they use GP to evolve equations out of data (aka Symbolic Regression).<p>Lastly, a shameless plug but if you want to play around with GPs I have written my own GP framework here: <a href=""http://chutsu.github.io/playground/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chutsu.github.io/playground/</a>  (very much a work in progress)",1431017252

In other words, start delegating more and place more trust in the people you delegate the work to. If you&#x27;re currently a workaholic, it will definitely feel foreign to so fervently pursue having more &quot;unproductive&quot; time. Focus on the &quot;big wins.&quot; People, especially talented ones, have a tendency to work UP to the level of expectation and trust.<p>* Spend more effort planning out the week on Day 1. Track what is being done,  but focus on where you want to be above which specific tasks are getting done. Ensure progress is being made, even if tasks feel like they&#x27;re piling up (this happens; that&#x27;s life).

Then you can attack the problem with whatever text-based tools you want.<p>But to me, having a utility that I could do things like, get a range of log lines — in sorted order —, or, grep on just the message, would be amazing. These are all things that proponents of grep I&#x27;m sure will say &quot;you can!&quot; do with grep… but you can&#x27;t.<p>The dates example was a good one. I&#x27;d much rather:<p><pre><code>    log-cat <bin-log> --from 2014-12-14 --to 2015-01-27\n</code></pre>\nAlso, my log files are not &quot;sorted&quot;. They are, but they&#x27;re sorted _per-process_, and I might have multiple instances of some daemon running (perhaps on this VM, perhaps across many VMs), and it&#x27;s really useful to see their logs merged together[2]. For this, you need to understand the notion of where a record starts and ends, because you need to re-order whole records. (And log records&#x27; messages are _going_ to contain newlines. I&#x27;m not logging a backtrace on one line.) grep doesn&#x27;t sort. |sort doesn&#x27;t know enough about a text log to adequately sort, but<p><pre><code>    $ log-cat logs/*.log --from 2014-12-14 --to 2015-01-27\n    <sorted output!>\n</code></pre>\nBinary files offer the opportunity for structured data. It&#x27;s really annoying to try to find all 5xx&#x27;s in a log, and your grep matches the process ID, the line number, the time of day…<p>I&#x27;ve seen some well-meaning attempts at trying to do JSON logs, s.t. each line is a JSON object[1]. (I&#x27;ve also seen it attempted were all that is available is a rudimentary format string, and the first &quot; breaks everything.)<p>Lastly, log files sometimes go into metrics (I don&#x27;t really think this is a good idea, personally, but we need better libraries here too…). Is your log format even parseable? I&#x27;ve yet to run across one that had an unambiguous grammar: a newline in the middle of a log message, with the right text on the second line, can easily get picked up as a date, and suddenly, it&#x27;s a new record. Every log file &quot;parser&quot; I&#x27;ve seen was a heuristic matcher, and I&#x27;ve seem most all of them make mistakes. With the simple &quot;log-cat&quot; above, you can instantly turn a binary log into a text one. The reverse — if possible — is likely to be a &quot;best-effort&quot; transformation.<p>[1]: the log writer is forbidden to output a newline inside the object. This doesn&#x27;t diminish what you can output in JSON, and allows newline to be the record separator.<p>[2]: I get requests from mobile developers tell me that the server isn&#x27;t acting correctly all the time. In order to debug the situation, I first need to _find_ their request in the log. I don&#x27;t know what process on what VM handled their request, but I often have a _very_ narrow time-range that it occurred in.",1431016824

Parallel construction is also a concern - a process where the government &quot;launders&quot; information received unconstitutionally, such as lying and claiming it was from a confidential informant; or using the illegally received information to give them insight into how to pursue building a &quot;clean&quot; line of evidence that appears to be from scratch but isn&#x27;t, such as &quot;coincidentally&quot; stopping a particular vehicle for a traffic violation, when investigators know the vehicle will be breaking the law from their dragnet surveillance (e.g., smuggling drugs). In some cases, these agencies have lied to the courts about how they obtained their evidence.<p>> But instead of being truthful with criminal defendants, judges, and even prosecutors about where the information came from, DEA agents are reportedly obscuring the source of these tips. For example, a law enforcement agent could receive a tip from SOD—which SOD, in turn, got from the NSA—to look for a specific car at a certain place. But instead of relying solely on that tip, the agent would be instructed to find his or her own reason to stop and search the car. Agents are directed to keep SOD under wraps and not mention it in &quot;investigative reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony,&quot; according to Reuters.<p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intel...</a>",1431015396

It almost forces you to choose celebrities, etc. that you&#x27;re interested in, it nags you constantly to add more people, it even e-mails you about it. If I didn&#x27;t know what Twitter was or why I wanted it, it would drive me away within the hour.<p>Plus, they&#x27;re showing favourites in your feed now, as if they were retweets, which means that your feed is getting cluttered with things that people didn&#x27;t mean to share to you, that you may not want to see, whether you like it or not. Then if you visit someone&#x27;s page on Twitter, it&#x27;s no longer a simple list of tweets. There are older tweets that Twitter&#x27;s algorithm likes more, then their more recent tweets, and they&#x27;re all different sizes to draw your attention to the tweet Twitter thinks you should read, rather than whatever you might want to read.<p>All in all, it reminds me of Facebook&#x27;s non-chronological timeline. I look at my feed on FB, and I see a post from last week, then yesterday, then an hour ago, then two weeks ago, then last Tuesday, etc. It&#x27;s a mess. I once refreshed my feed and saw two posts, back-to-back, from the same company. One talking about their livestream &#x27;tomorrow&#x27; from the day before (i.e. the livestream was today), and one talking about how their hour-long livestream was starting in &#x27;ten minutes&#x27; (from two hours ago). These were two items that were highly relevant <i>and</i> time-sensitive, and which didn&#x27;t show up in my feed until after it was too late to do anything about them.<p>On top of that, it often fails to show me content from people I care about (e.g. my wife) but shows me lots of &#x27;someone-you-know commented on someone you&#x27;ve-never-heard-of&#x27;s selfie&#x27;. It shows me three things that someone, whose posts I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> interacted with, posted today, but nothing my wife, whose posts I comment on, like, share, etc. all the time, posted today. Then, out of the blue, it &#x27;surfaces&#x27; content from last week back to the top of my feed again.<p>And this is what Twitter seems to be trying to do: figure out what we &#x27;should&#x27; be looking at to &#x27;drive engagement&#x27;. Because they can&#x27;t create a sane onboarding procedure that accomplishes any of this, they&#x27;re just going to start doing it to everyone, even non-logged-in users, in the hopes that the users they attract will be of higher value than the users they drive away.",1431015293

When I fill up, it updates that number.<p>Still, you very quickly learn that you get X number of miles with a full tank of gas.  You just know that.  You also learn you need to refill your tank N number of times in the course of a month on average due to your normal driving patterns.  None of this requires much thought.  And, if you are going on a long trip you generally know how far you can go on a single tank of gas and hopefully you&#x27;ve verified that there are gas stations along the route to top-off as you go (which in the US is generally the case).<p>As far as calculating the cost of a trip, again, if you live in miles-per-gallon land it is easy.  Nobody goes into a crying frenzy screaming &quot;Why, oh why don&#x27;t we use liters per 100 km.  This is so hard!&quot;.  No, instead people have an estimate of their average miles-per-gallon or an accurate historical average from their car&#x27;s information display system.  They get the distance to their destination and divide.  And, no, there&#x27;s no need to divide 483.5 miles by 21.3 miles-per-gallon.  That&#x27;s insane.  Nobody does that.  Your goal is to get a sense of proportion of how much fuel you&#x27;ll need.  So, you divide 500 by 20 and you&#x27;ll get a decent number.  It won&#x27;t be twice that many gallons nor half.  There are plenty of gas stations along the route.  No worries.  And, if you need an accurate number for reimbursement purposes, well, keep the receipts.<p>So, again, I think you are trying to solve a non-existing problem.<p>Now, on the question of metric vs. imperial.  Well, I detest the imperial system of units.  I hate it.  I use metric for engineering purposes.  The world is metric.  It is ridiculous that we haven&#x27;t made the switch.<p>That said, I fully understand why.  Unless you&#x27;ve traveled through the US it is hard to get a sense of proportion.  This place is huge.  The infrastructure is of unimaginable proportions.  Going metric could very well take 100 years due to the sheer amount of work and cost involved.  So, yeah, I get it.<p>There are other seemingly minor examples of this.  We sell internationally so I am very aware of cultural and systemic differences.  For example, most of the world would write one thousand dollars like this: $1.000,00.  In the US it is written like this: $1,000.00.  In the US 1/2/2015 means January 2nd, 2015. In the rest of the world it means February 1st, 2015.  In the US we use AM and PM.  In a good deal of the world it is a 24 hour clock (which makes far more sense).<p>There are a lot more examples of this.  If we can&#x27;t fix something as simple as what the comma and period mean when speaking about money or the order of the day and month on a date we are doomed to fail in shifting the US to the metric system.",1431015111

The spec gcc benchmarks showed the CPU doing quite well against significantly more expensive intel machines. So, we jumped on it, and haven&#x27;t regretted it for a minute. Its a good combination of lots of cores and fast single threaded performance (for the linking and packaging). Combined with the SSDs and ECC RAM, its quite a screamer.<p>We have a number of intel machines for other purposes, and it still costs probably about 2x in intel land to get a machine to beat it.

It makes it seem like there are always only two choices, when in reality, there are many, if not infinite.<p>Also, there are always going to be some people who understand the machine better than the machine understands itself. Even if it means taking those gigantic tables of probabilities and abstracting over them to form some kind of representational language that can be used to predict complex non-deterministic machine behavior (similar to how we already try to predict non-deterministic behavior, or not) in complex systems.<p>As a corollary, I would argue that machines have already modified humans. They affect the way we think and reason. They are an integral part of our life and the machine abstraction can be projected onto that which it does not describe completely (in which, the technology that exists now can not construct the technology we envision). We program machines, machines program us. This seems obvious.",1431014721

It should be noted that Microsoft's efforts are failing, though their tablet will probably see some success. (EDIT: That's clearly not the reason why Microsoft built phones in the first place, but I think it's a solid justification for why they still care. Windows Phone is a money loser thus far.)<p>Facebook doesn't have a phone. They're rumored to be building one. I don't understand why it's a good investment for them when their apps are on every phone, with contacts integration on iOS.<p>Amazon is rumored to be building a phone, but I don't understand the logic behind it. The only reason they have a mobile OS is because they needed a device to push their content to.<p>Other than advertising, I don't see a good reason for Yahoo to start building devices that are any more involved than throwing some Yahoo apps on top of Android.

There's no other way to get to upper salary ranges. Either that or manager.<p>And 200k is not that crazy in San Francisco or socal. Heck, 75 and you can barely support a suburban family.<p>Now, the real problem is management, or better: performance review and promotions. In a corp that size, it doesn't matter if you save 1mi a month in infrastructure costs with a months work. No. You have to come up with a nice project name and make it sound complex and big. Nobody remembers to look at outcome in performance meetings. They focus on projects and shenanigans.<p>So, keep the architects, tell them they can simply work instead of coming up with projects names, and fire the middle management...

It's exactly up our alley...or, at least, the upvotes seem to indicate it is, and I agree that it is.<p>Here's why I think he's interesting:<p>1. He was an astonishingly good businessman in a time when black men were rarely given opportunities in business, even in the music industry. He is nearly unique even in the jazz world (which was better for black folks than most other industries of the time) for the level of his business success.<p>2. He was a great leader. He's regarded as one of the best jazz band leaders ever. He helped nurture multiple generations of jazz greats. If you can name a jazz legend from any time until his death, they probably played with Miles before they were a legend. An executive at a startup would do well to learn from him how to pass on skills and help develop even greater talents than their own (many people who played with Miles ended up being better musicians than Miles, and pretty much all became better than they were before they played with Miles).<p>3.

4259315,comment,4258826,4258826,5,0,btilly,,,"Now the fun part is that your time has different value to different people.<p>For instance for yourself, your time may be worth what you are being paid.  Suppose that you get $120k/year.  You work 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year, so you're being paid $60/hour.  So if money for something comes out of you, $60/hour is a cap on what you're willing to pay - and actually it is less than that because you have little direct ability to change how much you're being paid.<p>Now let's look at that same employee from the point of view of the employer.  If you've got an employee, after benefits, office space, training, etc, on average you're paying 2x salary for that person.  (This figure varies by organization, but 2x is a typical figure.)  That person works for you 50 weeks per year, 5 days/week, 6 hours per day.  (Why 6 hours?  Well they are present for 8, but take lunch, do personal emails, etc.  So they only really work for perhaps 6 of those hours.)  Do the math - that employee is costing $160/hour.<p>$60 vs $160 for the same person is pretty bad, but it does not end here.  In order for it to make sense to hire an employee, you want that employee to be earning you more than they cost.  So $160/hour is a floor for the value you hope they are providing - hopefully that figure is more like $200/hour or more.<p>The moral is that an employee's time is worth massively more for an employer than an employee.  And therefore a wise employer should be willing to pay several times more than the employee to make improvements in how efficiently that time gets used.<p>(That said, there is a breed of employee who, faced with an employer who is willing to be generous, will try to figure out how much they can ask for.  There is a balance to be found...)",1342584781

I&#x27;ve been mostly normal for 3 years and I&#x27;m well-treated, although YC/HN-style startups are out of the question (can&#x27;t risk going without insurance).<p>Health problems are like many natural disasters (e.g. hurricanes, earthquakes, heat waves) where it&#x27;s not the event itself that kills people and causes suffering so much as <i>human</i> failures: looting, under-maintained infrastructure, incompetence by trusted service providers and malfeasance by insurers and various unscrupulous opportunists.<p>When you&#x27;re sick, the health problem itself is challenging. The continuing onslaught of people failing you (which you&#x27;ll frequently blame yourself for, especially if it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s wrong with you) or exploiting your (no matter how intermittent) weakness is demoralizing.<p>Now that I&#x27;m well I fight back against human failure and indecency and I will not stop.",1416884305

The most popular expositor, Dr. John Sarno, grounds his theory in Freudian psychology. The situation is probably better when speaking with practitioners in mental health, but maybe not by so much: my psychiatrist was utterly unsurprised—was nothing new to him.

8656034,comment,8649617,8653340,0,0,jamesisaac,,,"Something that can really help with this is getting out of the mindset of identifying yourself by your achievements.  You talked about stoicism and being in the present, but it sounds like you&#x27;re very preoccupied and anxious over how others will percieve your potential success/failure.<p>One of the aspects of experiencing the present moment is cutting away that ego - realising that ego isn&#x27;t actually part of conscioussness, it&#x27;s just something you&#x27;re choosing to cling onto and identify with.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t pursue goals and achievement - just that you&#x27;re not tying them to your happiness.  To quote Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle (which you may want to consider reading):<p>&quot;Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or fail in the world? // It matters to you as long as you haven&#x27;t realised your inner purpose. After that, the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outer purpose and at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the other way round, which is actually more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to &#x27;gain the world and lose your soul&#x27;. Ultimately, of course, every outer purpose is doomed to &#x27;fail&#x27; sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner you realise that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you make it subservient to your inner purpose.&quot;",1416883509

8656009,comment,8653416,8653899,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I agree for the most part. In terms of getting more women in tech the most important change isn&#x27;t necessarily to encourage starting early but rather to encourage tech as a pragmatic career choice. To be honest that&#x27;s why most men are in tech and in CS programs. And the more women are in CS and engineering programs, merely because it seems like a good way to make a living, the more accepted that will be and the easier it will be for other women to see that as a legitimate lifestyle choice and a career that won&#x27;t just be a constant upstream fight against the current. That&#x27;s the sort of thing that leads to a positive feedback loop of women going into tech until it&#x27;s no longer seen as unusual.<p>On the other hand, there is something to be said for fostering early passion in tech. A lot of times folks end up in tech because they rekindled or amplified some earlier passion or interest. Your story of coding at 13 is somewhat rare but it&#x27;s even rarer to find someone who ended up in tech who had no prior interest in the field whatsoever. A young boy at 13 may not have an interest in programming or see software development as a likely career choice, but they will likely see it as a desirable choice. And they will see various techie activities as things their friends do, things they should be expected to do, things that are fun and doable, etc. That sort of thing makes it easier to get into tech early and makes it easier to get into tech later because it doesn&#x27;t seem like such a crazy jump. Additionally, often times it&#x27;s the folks who got into tech due to an early passion who end up being some of the most successful.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve left and come back to this a couple times so I&#x27;m probably rambling. My point is that each half of the equation (early vs late engagement) relies on the other to some degree, and though it&#x27;s the late engagement which is more impactful, encouraging early interest is still important.",1416882758

One of the things he has is low magnesium and zinc just like this author. He&#x27;s also suffered from bouts of unexplained amnesia (is that where the author got the name for his blog from? If so maybe they actually have the same thing!?). His sleep schedule is completely screwed to the extent that i hardly see him and he never gets sunlight. He has serotonin and dopamine issues.

A key aspect to it is that there is no distinguishing the symptoms from actual physical sensations. I could have started making progress with my own issues years earlier when someone brought up this possibility to me, except that I felt like what I was experiencing was &#x27;too real&#x27; to be mental, or something.<p>Medical practitioners outside of mental health seem relatively unaware of these disorders, but if you speak with a psychiatrist, you may receive some useful info.

8655930,comment,8654798,8655567,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"I forgot to mention another thing he didn&#x27;t know was useful<p>d) BCD instructions, which he thinks are &quot;kind of silly&quot;, and perhaps they are now that computers run at many GHz. But they were very useful in the old days. E.g. CBASIC [1] implemented BCD floating point math. Here&#x27;s what Wiki says about it:<p><pre><code>   CBASIC proved very popular because it\n   incorporated 14-digit binary-coded decimal\n   (BCD) math which eliminated MBASIC&#x27;s rounding\n   errors that were sometimes troublesome for\n   accounting.\n</code></pre>\nAs the reference manual linked [2] from Wiki says:<p><pre><code>   Real numbers are stored in eight bytes of\n   memory. The first byte is the sign and\n   exponent. The exponent is maintained in\n   excess 64 code. The seven remaining bytes\n   contain a normalized mantissa stored as\n   packed decimal digits. The high order four\n   bits of the rightmost byte is the most\n   significant digit of the mantissa.\n</code></pre>\nThat was of course long before IEEE 754 floating point.[3] BTW did anyone know that IEEE defined decimal floating point? I didn&#x27;t know that until just now. It&#x27;s probably not that popular.<p>When a CPU runs at 1 MHz instead of 3 GHz, doing FP in BCD means much simpler and much faster conversion between internal representation and display. A lot of early microcomputers were used by small business. BCD is inferior for complicated scientific calculations, but is ideal for simple small business accounting, which was CBASICs target market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBASIC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBASIC</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.cpm.z80.de/manuals/cbasic-m.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpm.z80.de/manuals/cbasic-m.pdf</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point</a>",1416880911

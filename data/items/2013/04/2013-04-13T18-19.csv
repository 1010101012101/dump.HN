For folks in the Valley, in NYC, or in companies working at the bleeding edge, you want to fund the best, most qualified people, period. That makes sense, and in the best interests of the country.<p>But, in terms of numbers, the real money is the more banal ""staff augmentation"" programmers that you see in ""compliance advertisements"" in industry trade rags. There is a shortage of qualified COBOL programmers, but you don't hear about training programs for COBOL (back in the 70's clerical staff were trained to do write that stuff, not compsci types). But you do see government contracts paying $30/hour to ""body shop"" vendors, who in turn are paying Indians $12-17/hr. similar story for people doing business rules in some J2EE thing.<p>That's a problem, because many of the few million un- or under-employed workers in the US could be trained to do this type of work quickly.",1365879575

Of course it costs more to provide a better product, which was the original reasoning behind providing native desktop applications.<p>What they're doing now has more to do with politics and skillsets amongst traditionally web-focused engineering management and teams, than it does with actually creating a great product. Spotify has a ridiculously hard time hiring outside their management's core competency of web-focused development, including both for mobile and desktop. That has more to do with their management than the job market, though.<p>As an aside, I can't say I understand <i>why</i> web developers find it so impossible to migrate to mobile/desktop.

Any experienced patent prosecutor/attorney will be able to draft something that is acceptable to the patent office.<p>The Amazon 1-Click patent, for example, was held to be valid because the software and algorithms were attached to a physical system (of collecting and storing customer information along with an automated process of inventory gathering to shipping).<p>Most patent lawyers here in Canada are of the opinion that software _can_ be patentable, and that the trend is towards patentability. The main difference between US and Canada is not their respective Patent Acts (which are fairly similar), but the attitude of both the Patent Office and the courts in dealing with these things. It seems that the USPTO very easily accepts software patents, while Canadian patent examiners seem to be a little more strict on the requirements set out regarding software. Indeed, the Amazon 1-Click case arose in Canada because the patent office _rejected_ Amazon's patent, rather than the other way around as it seems more common in US.",1365878113

You want to stay hired - you patent everything you can, to reach the targets.<p>A friend worked for a company that did code maintenance (support/bug fixing) for some embedded IBM systems. They were bought by IBM, and in the first meeting their new IBM boss said to them ""I checked the company records and I see no patents. This needs to be changed."" What kind of patents can you get while fixing bugs in some C code written by somebody else?",1365876440

As a random example, the US spends $55 billion on pets annually, which is just an arbitrary number to me. But convert this to about $165 per capita and now it's much easier to see if this number is reasonable, compare it to other expenditures, etc.<p>(And then there's the satirical visualization from Saturday Night Live: How big is a $16 trillion dollar debt?

Is it really smart to buy solar panels and large batteries that amortize over 10 years when there could be a technological breakthrough right around the corner? Do you really want to be in a position to operate and maintain that technology, buy insurance, deal with repairs, etc? I know I don't.<p>And if you're talking about disconnecting from the grid entirely (I know you don't but the OP did), you suddenly have a high availability issue on your hands. That's never going to happen.<p>I think at the end of the day, solar will be operated by utilities. They don't have to buy all equipment on one day, so they can spread the risk. They have professional staff to fix and maintain things when they are broken.",1365876257

Part of this is a legislated requirement, but I think the big motivator is how the regulator calculates their profit margin. AFAIK, they don't make their margin on selling electrons, but on capital investment. Higher utilization of their generating capacity just means slimmer profit margins. Most of their plants are 40-50 years old so they have plenty of capital investment and profits headed their way even if solar cuts into demand. I could be wrong about any or all of this, since I'm working off memory and I'm not going to read 100 page regulator reports.",1365876040

If instead one defines mobility based on the probability that a child from a low-income family (e.g., the bottom 20%) reaches a fixed upper income threshold (e.g., \n$100,000), then mobility has increased because of the increase in inequality. However, the increase in inequality has also magnified the difference in expected incomes between children born to low (e.g., bottom-quintile) vs. high (top-quintile) income families. In this sense, mobility has fallen because a child’s income depends more heavily on her parents’ position in the income distribution \ntoday than in the past.",1391264924

7161680,comment,7158786,7160952,3,0,elohesra,,,"I disagree with your position.<p>When we regulate free speech -- in any way whatsoever -- we open ourselves up to greater regulation of free speech. Free speech is a special privilege in that only unrestricted free speech can argue against restrictions on free speech. Once you grant restrictions against free speech, you open yourself up to a position where your speech becomes so restricted that you become unable to even argue why it should be less restricted.<p>Furthermore I strongly disagree that restrictions on speech should be relative to either the social position of the speaker, or the harms posed by the speaker. If our justification for preventing speech is that the speaker&#x27;s speech could be mistaken as the official position of some group (in this case the TSA), then this gives us a legitimation to shut down <i>all</i> speech, as we can simply twist the speaker&#x27;s position as being representative of some group to which they&#x27;re tenuously related. A woman wants to speak out unpopularly against x? Well, we can claim she represents all women, and her speaking out would sour the position of the public towards women. A black man wants to speak out against unpopular y? Same argument. Jewish? Same argument. And so on. This is why speech is an <i>individual</i> right, regardless of circumstance.<p>As for the (in my opinion, unpersuasive) argument that the harm caused by speech should be legitimation to close down certain speech, no speech in-and-of itself is harmful. Speech is just speech, and <i>cannot</i> itself be harmful. It is people&#x27;s reactions to speech which causes harm. Even if we claim certain classes of speech (say, yelling fire) have predictable outcomes that can cause harm, we also have to accept that harmful speech can sometimes be necessary. When the founding fathers spoke out against the tyranny of the British (or so I hear; I&#x27;m British!), this lead to a civil war which cost hundreds of thousands of people their lives. Same again when Lincoln spoke out against the separatist south. Same again when Churchill spoke out against the Nazi threat. Yet few would argue the harms caused by these pieces of speech should cause them to be banned, even though these pieces of speech resulted in the deaths of millions.<p>This means that we cannot be logically consistent when we claim to ban speech based upon harm, so we either have to change our justification (i.e. admit that it&#x27;s not really harm we&#x27;re avoiding, but specific types of harm), or admit that we&#x27;re being illogical in selecting lesser harms (discomfort felt by non-Americans, in your example) as justification to shut down speech, and greater harms (the deaths of millions, as above) as protected speech.<p>Honestly, free speech is simply too fundamental to both democracy and philosophical/scientific progress to tamper with. No matter what lesser right you put up against it, you&#x27;d have a hard time convincing me that it should trump free speech, the right which underlies our very society.",1391264089

We&#x27;ve received several emails from Microsoft saying we need to update this and that or our apps will be removed. Because the apps never did that well - not surprisingly in hindsight given the market size - we never updated them. However we still get checks occasionally from the proceeds. Microsoft never removed them. I think they&#x27;re just desperate to have apps in their store and inflated app numbers they can brag about. They obviously know what to do, but just aren&#x27;t doing it.",1391263372

Create a series of storefronts that are tiered. You can get almost anything into the dollar store equivalent. And then you have to apply to move into the higher tier, or a focused tier. It should cost money to do so -- which could be paid back out of sales at the new tier.<p>Physical stores have buyers who inspect products, negotiate, and select. App stores need to the same thing.<p>It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve bought anything on an app store. There&#x27;s just way too much crap to wade through, making it a waste of time.",1391263302

Likewise, I throw out a quick question of my own every now and then, when I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s too subjective in nature to avoid being closed by StackOverflow-lawyers.<p>I&#x27;ve lost interest in general chat, outside of specific questions and answers.  From what I&#x27;ve seen, the nicer communities are the newer channels.  Ironically, they degrade over time as their underlying technology matures.  You would think that channels like #clojure and #go-nuts would be populated by immature hipsters, while ##java would be made up of 40-something corporate types.  However, I&#x27;ve found that those first two channels are welcoming and thoughtful, with interesting discussion always taking place... whereas ##java (even its mods) frequently sound like pre-teens yelling profanity at each other on XBox Live.",1391263203

5834044,comment,5833947,5833947,1,0,chengyinliu,,,"Not using feature branch at all is something new to me. Our current strategy is closed to the one Vincent Driessen described in his [blog post](<a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>).<p>I am not clear on if it is actually better to not use feature branch. The article gave a couple of reasons:<p>1. You don't have to do merges.\n2. Risk is generally spread out more evenly into a large number of very small risks created as each commit lands.\n3. You can test interactions between features in development easily.\n4. You can A/B test and do controlled rollouts easily.<p>I do agree with 1, 2 and 3. However, I am not sure how to weigh them. One scenario worries me about everyone developing on development is what if someone break development? Admittedly, we need a large test coverage for it, but feature branch isolates each develop group nicely and minimize the risk of one group being interrupted by the other. For reason #4, I don't see how it is a clear advantage. I think there is a way to do the same with feature branches, as long as the developer keep both version on the branch.<p>I'd like to hear your opinions on this. More over, it sounds to me that with this branching modeling, a variety of systems (e.g. GateKeeper) needs to be in place. What exactly are those systems?",1370541582

If you mean have your card issuer give you a new card with a new number, and stop allowing charges using the old number, that isn't necessarily sufficient. You may have to close your underlying account.<p>Visa and MasterCard both have updater services, which are available to some (but not all--I'm not sure what exactly the requirements are for access) merchants that accept their cards. The updater service allows the merchant to inquire about a particular card number and receive back a status that can be one of: no info available; card still valid; card replaced and here is the new card number and expiration date; account closed.",1370541577

Linear regression is a type of regression. Classification is trying to predict a category (e.g. condo vs apartment). Logistic regression is usually used for classification over two categories (even though it confusingly has 'regression' in the name).

Small business lending dried up and has taken years to recover, despite all the efforts to convince banks to do otherwise.<p>The government did a notoriously bad job of putting the stimulus spending money to work.<p>As for businesses, hiring has been slow, wages stagnant and investment weak for years, despite an excess of cash (profits).<p>Almost nothing has been done to stimulate demand, much has been done to stimulate supply.<p>So, arguments about ""hoarding"" have not only economic basis, they have a basis in fact as well.<p>Granted, on those grounds, Sean Parker should be lauded for putting some of his money to work.",1370541083

Told us face to face, in plain\nEnglish/Russian.  No phone records, Internet\ndata intercepts, super computers required.<p>Really sounds like 'security theater', like\nSenator Feinstein is having fun straining\nher arm patting herself on the back for\n""protecting the US"" and a lot of middle\nmanagers in the huge NSA funny farm are\nhaving fun doing what not very good\nmiddle managers are wont to do, build\nempires.

Nope,\nnot the sharpest tack in the box.\nReally, a bit out of it.  We're talking\nslow witted.  I was the grader for\nthe class, and as I recall he never\ngot anything correct.  He said nothing\nin class and lasted a few weeks,\nand then we didn't see him again.<p>Second, there's a great photograph\ntaken, likely, at a Congressional\nhearing, of the head of the NSA\nand standing not far away\nDiffie Hellman or one of the RSA\nguys, etc.  The Hellman guy,\nof course, had been explaining public key\ncrypto-systems that heavily embarrassed \nthe NSA and, really, essentially\nput it out of business for its\nstated mission, is smiling.\nAs I recall, he had blond hair\nlong, nearly to his waist.\nThe head of the NSA, a real\nram rod straight arrow,\nshort hair, close shave,\ncrease in his shirt, etc.\nis a sour\nlooking puss.  Torqued.  Like\nhe was just made a fool of,\nembarrassed, like he's just lost\nhis self-respect, career, etc.<p>The evidence is that the NSA is\na bunch of fumble bumblers\ncollectively about three cans\nshort of a six pack.\nWe should be even more concerned about the\nNSA if there was good evidence\nthat they were competent.<p>NSA has thousands and thousands\nof people.  Even if some of the\npeople are bright with good\nbackgrounds, they will get lost\nin the mob of paper pushers,\nmediocre middle managers,\nand high end military brass.<p>First fundamental problem:  Too much\nbig gumment.

Whether\nhe said this or not, there's a point\nthere.<p>We're again back to the old\n""America always does the right thing\nafter trying everything else."".<p>Money wasting, incompetent big\ngumment is a very ugly thing.\nIf they try actually to do something, then\nthey get even uglier.  When they\ntake the next step and really want\nto take over, then they are taking\nus close to Hitler, Mao, etc.<p>The US founding fathers were fully\ncorrect:  ""The price of liberty\nis eternal vigilance."".<p>The thing for Congress to do is just\nto cut the budgets.  How much?\nRecently there was a report that\nsupposedly the wealthiest area of\nthe US is Silicon Valley.  Next\nwas the hedge fund area of CT.\nNext?  And the nominees are,\nHouston with its oil,\nNYC with its finance,\nChicago with its ""broad shoulders"",\nRedmond with its computing,\nand within 100 miles of the\nWashington Monument with its\nbig gumment.  May I have the\nenvelope, please?  Yes,\nhere it is.  And the winner\nis (drum roll) within 100 miles\nof the Washington Monument\nwith its big gumment.<p>Put it on a diet.  Cut it back.\nLeave the money in the hands of the\ncitizens.  Then let that money\nbe seed corn actually to get the\neconomy going again.<p>Kings of old commonly bled their\ncountries white, over their\ndelusions of self-importance\nand especially their absurd\nforeign adventures.  Now DC\nis doing the same.<p>For people leaving back packs\nwith pressure cookers in public\nplaces, sorry 'bout that, but\nNSA, FBI, CIA, DHS, etc. clearly\nare no real solution.  So, \nbasically we just have to leave\nthat issue to local police.<p>NSA, etc. are short on both safety\nfor our democracy and efficacy\nfor stopping the bad guys.<p>Yes,\nyes, we know that they are incompetent.\nBut we have to understand:  They\nare really, really expensive, a gigantic\nwaste.\nBesides\nthey trash the spirit and/or letter\nof the Constitution.<p>Just vote for guys in Congress who\nwill cut their budgets.

5833687,comment,5831491,5833564,11,0,mediaman,,,"This is a great point. Because software has near-zero replication costs, the ""manufacturing"" process has no good analog for software industry.<p>The manufacturing industry is supported by an army of engineers in a wide variety of specialties. In fact, manufacturing, in some ways, is starting to look a little more similar to software, because the non-material costs of production are falling (automation replaces direct labor) so replication costs are falling. Manufacturing will never look exactly like software due to the intrinsic role of raw material costs and the capital costs of production equipment, but there are increasing similarities.<p>As manufacturing has become more automated, a greater emphasis is placed on the role of engineer: in an automated factory, there is greater need for skilled engineers and lesser need for direct operating labor.<p>While better software has also helped these engineers become more productive, the net effect has been to improve quality of engineering output rather than to reduce engineering demand. (The exception is people working with engineers, but at a lower skill level. For example, there is little need for draftspeople.) Examples of this improved engineering output are flow simulation software that allows engineers to better push the envelope in part design to reduce part weight and improve production cycle times.<p>The net lesson from manufacturing engineering is that software engineers will continue to be in demand -- likely even higher demand -- so long as they continue to evolve their skills to use the more powerful software as it becomes available. The more powerful software will lessen the cost of software, which will increase demand for it, and increase demand for the skilled developer. For example, abstraction platforms such as Rails increased demand for those who evolved their skill set, because cost of web development fell due to higher productivity, thereby increasing demand for it.<p>However, like a draftsperson or an engineer who refuses to learn Solidworks, the more powerful software will be a negative for those who cannot, or choose not to, evolve their skill set above a more basic level.",1370538817
5833686,comment,5831491,5833519,3,0,grey-area,,,"Unfortunately I feel we're in a negative spiral, where good content (e.g. quality reporting and analysis, as in the example in the article) competes with free content which is just good enough to draw attention and pay for itself with advertising. Something is lost there, and in the rush to make everything free we're also losing the incentive for quality journalism or investigative writing, which are just too expensive to sustain on advertising alone.<p>If that results in a gradual erosion of quality as less and less effort is put in to researching and writing articles, and more and more of the content is churnalism or opinion pieces, then it's a net loss for everyone - eventually the adverts will be more interesting than the real content which lives in the interstices of advertising - I think that would be a shame. I've seen that happening in major newspapers in the UK like the Independent or the Guardian.

What is the actual size used to represent a string, or an in, or a double in the language?  What happens when you want to compare/convert different types?<p>Either the language provides these capabilities, in which case it's doing some memory management of it's own, or you write them, in which case it wasn't necessarily all that dynamic to start with.<p>I imagine it might look like what you get when you try to write a dynamic language in C (Perl, Ruby, Python), a lot of macros that automate what's going on to the degree you are mostly writing some macro based DSL.",1370538147

5833610,comment,5829442,5833405,1,0,rayiner,,,"> The fact that Google hosts that data does not give them ownership of that data, nor does it confer the right to access that data for any reason. The data in my drafts folder is exactly the same as data in a paper journal that I have in my house, and is protected by exactly the same law, the 4th amendment.<p>This is what I refer to as the ""romanticized view"" of technology. Your gmail draft is not like the paper journal you have in your house. It's Google's data on its hardware that its engineers have access to (in clear text!). You want to construct this metaphor, where the ""physical location doesn't matter"", but that's not the underlying nature of the system.<p>You say that ""representation"" shouldn't matter, but you're making the opposite argument. You want different rules for digital representations versus physical ones. The rule right now is that once the information, represented as molecules of ink on fibers of paper, is in someone else's possession, it's not <i>your</i> information anymore. Well at the physical level, your gmail drafts are little flipped magnetic domains on a hard drive platter in a Google data center. If you tried to enter that data center, you'd be thrown out for trespassing. But you think that in this case, the law should construct a metaphor: those bits are ""private"" even though you don't have possession of them or ownership of the medium on which they reside.<p>Thought experiment: if I chisel my diary into a rock slab and mail it to Google, do you agree that it's their data now? What if I write it to a magnetic hard drive and mail it to them? No difference, right? So why should it suddenly be different if I send the bits over the internet for Google to write to its own hard drive instead of mailing them a hard drive myself?",1370538078

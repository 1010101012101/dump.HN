Obvious, to the extent that journals always <i>have</i> employed scientifically trained editors  they're called ""editors""  to do everything from tweaking bad phrasing to offering criticism to ultimately making the final decision about what gets published. Silly, because journal editors are rarely experts in <i>your</i> specific field. How can they be? There are a <i>lot</i> of scientific fields.

There is a <i>lot</i> of stuff published that rehashes (without citation) existing published results or minor variations on them, sometimes from decades earlier, that the authors and reviewers just didn't happen to be familiar with. If you accelerate everything and distribute the peer-review to people with less deep knowledge of the literature, I suspect this will only increase, adding more noise to the literature as we spend the 2010s rediscovering the 1970s, accompanied by triumphant press releases and blog posts about Breakthrough Discoveries.<p>I notice this particularly in computer science, where it seems nobody is capable of locating or reading journal articles published before around 1995, a handful of canonical ""classic"" papers excepted.",1320773569

The reviewers are a very small selection of other scientists, who are expert in the field of the publication.</i><p>So, when you throw work out into the open, anyone with an interest in your topic (your functional peers) will be able to do their own analysis of your work (a review)--some sort of peer-review, if you will. All without needing to go through a stodgy paper review process.<p><i>This way of work is important to keep quality excellent. We certainly don't need more quickly published junk that stirs the world but is found to be inaccurate later.</i><p>So, if there is one thing we've seen in the programming world, secluded cabals of experts don't always result in excellent quality (I submit to you, OpenGL, C++, CORBA, for a few examples).<p>New patches are submitted to open-source projects all the time; some are accepted, some are rebuked publicly, and some merely catalyze interesting discussion. ""Stirring the world"" is hardly a bad thing--in the case of Fleischmann-Pons, the debunking happened quickly and the world was free to move on. In a similar avenue, one of the reasons that the eCat story is frustrating is the lack of transparency (both from the inventors and the media refusing to even air solid rebuttals)--were the information more open, we could sort it into bunk/science and move on.<p><i>Can we accelerate the process of peer reviewing? I doubt that. As I have written, the reviewers are other scientists who have to find the time to read and comment new articles. The more time they spend with this, the less time they spend doing research. So the small amount of experts usually is responsible for being slow.</i><p>So, you make the (valid) claim that the process can't go faster, predicating on the scarcity of experts. You seem to have the answer at hand: get more experts. This can be accomplished by either getting more researchers reviewing, or loosening the restrictions on who is considered a valid source. Indeed, places like StackExchange have shown us how to pick out decently good judges of these things--we don't have as great a need for the older method of establishing experts, anymore.<p><i>2. The author writes, we could make progress faster. Please: why? It seems to be a sign of the time that we want to accelerate everything. It is most likely that this will only produce more noise. We need to slow down our lives and our thinking to stay accurate and produce real value.</i><p>In order to help motivate the need for faster progress, please note the following:<p><i>Earth has over 7 billion people now.</i> (<a href=""http://www.unfpa.org/swp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unfpa.org/swp/</a>)<p><i>The bottom 50% of people in the world (rightly or wrongly) own around 1% of the wealth.</i> (<a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3jv048hx#page-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3jv048hx#page-4</a>)<p>We (at least those of us in the first world) don't have a lot of time left, unless we can find ways of solving the Big Problems. Progress in tech is likely the only palatable solution to this predicament. We can't really afford to slow down now.<p><i>I am glad that science results, at least in my field, are still reliably scrutinized by many. This way I know that reading and spending the time to understand the stuff is worth my time.</i><p>I'm greatly concerned about this sort of attitude. Might I suggest that an occasional dalliance in ""time-wasting"" articles might prove refreshing, and further that it could help ferret out ideas that would otherwise be overlooked?<p>edit: Modified for civility.

So being risky and publishing about your failures becomes useful (no one publishes failures...). Speed also reduces duplicate work.<p>You're missing the point of scientific publication.  The entire point of publication is so others can reproduce your work.  Speed doesn't work if you need a billion data points taken over 20 years to prove a long term issue.<p>>The idea that a scientist should do everything seems to be more and more inefficient. We need to break down tasks like we do in the commercial world so that experts can move faster.<p>The problem here is that for a lot of cutting edge theoretical research, the experts are the only ones qualified to really vet the paper.  And finding experts that: 1.  Are capable of understanding everything in the paper and 2. Are willing to put aside their personal research to review the paper is a VERY small set of people.<p>For example, the P=NP proofs produced over the last few years were only presented to a small group of about 20 very qualified mathematicians to vet.  I, with an undergrad CS degree, could barely understand the summary of the proofs.  As far as I know, those proofs still have not been completely refuted or accepted.

They're all fighting for attention in a market saturated with novel apps (Instapaper for videos! another iOS photo sharing app!). Many of these apps create wealth, and many won't survive into next June.<p>Now compare these tiny startups with any larger startup or corporation. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare have a lot of users, and they need to build out bizdev teams to continue growing (marginal cost and all that). They need HR departments to build out those teams--now we're halfway down the road to internal hierarchies and politics. Ugh, corporate bullshit!<p>However, these startups can also advertise and market like crazy and watch as their growth charts show exponential behavior.<p>Traction and user retention are economies of scale.

819794,comment,819630,819753,0,0,arb,,,"It's unnecessarily ugly.<p>There's a lot of unnecessary state, where refs are initialized to nil, then only updated to a fixed value.  There's side effects in transactions (mostly around the Timer).  Not one function is defined with parameters, which ought to raise alarms.  The flow resembles Java code rewritten in Clojure, rather than a functional Clojure program.<p>Besides that, much of the code is either non-idiomatic or primitive: the 'ns' macro should be used instead of 'import'; 'alter' can be better than 'ref-set'; 'when' is better than 'if' without an else form; the proxy identation is wrong.<p>The AWT/Swing interaction is excusable, as is the poor readability given the brevity constraint for this exercise, but there are still some elementary problems.",1252814157

Also, they localize their deals to a city, so that you're buying things like teeth whitening sessions and dinners at fondue restaurants.<p>But the key to their success has been their customer / market validation, and the singleminded pursuit of their target demographic (which is itself interesting, as they're targeting 25-40 y.o. females in a high socioeconomic class).",1252813395

Therefore Quants caused the crash.""<p>This is a very popular sentiment, yet utterly false.  The companies that failed hardest- Lehman, Sterns, Fannie/Freddie, rating agencies- are (were) notoriously non quantitative.  They are frequently made fun of in Quant circles in fact.  Were any of these companies run by Math Wizards?  No.  Most of them have (once again, had) zero Quants in their upper management.

819783,comment,819131,819300,0,0,seldo,,,"If you ask me why Python -- and Rails, for that matter -- aren't trouncing PHP, it's because Python ignores Windows, and doesn't focus on the web.<p>Hold the flame throwers for a second.<p>Everyone on this site knows you shouldn't be deploying websites on Windows. And I agree. WAMP is not a sensible production environment. But it's a great <i>learning</i> environment.<p>Because what the Python hackers of the world seem to forget is that 95% of all the computers in the world are running Windows. And for very large numbers of the owners of those computers ""buy a second box and put Linux on it"" is not an available option, and ""run a virtual machine with Linux on it"" is really complicated. They don't want to learn a new operating system, they want to learn a language to build websites in. In fact, all they want to do is _build websites_, and the language is the means to an end. They will take the path of least resistance, not the path that is most elegant.<p>You want to build a website in Python on Windows? Good luck. Sure, Python has a great Windows installer -- but then what? Django? Some other web framework? Have you tried installing Django on Windows? It is a gigantic pain in the ass. Oh, and the MySQL libraries aren't included. Oh, and they don't work with Python 2.6 unless you find a super-secret download mentioned only on a mailing list. And then you have to learn Python, and then Django, and then you have to work out how to deploy it to your host's web server.<p>Here's how you do the same thing in PHP. You go somewhere like here:
<a href=""http://www.wampserver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wampserver.com/</a>
You download one file, run one installer, and it gives you Apache, PHP, and a MySQL server, all at the same time. You put some .php files in there and web pages start turning up in your browser. It's not pretty, it's not elegant, it doesn't scale, but it's your first web page ever and it's ready in 10 minutes. Ready to deploy? Copy your three PHP files to your web host via FTP, and presto, they work just like they did on your home machine.<p>Later, you discover frameworks. You learn about encapsulation, and MVC, and loose coupling and scalability. You work out that Windows is not exactly like your web host, which is running Linux. You might get around to installing Linux at that point, but you don't really have to because the differences are pretty minor. But whatever happens, at that point, you already know PHP. You're not going to switch languages.<p>Until Ruby and Python hackers swallow their pride and accept that welcoming newbies to the language means not forcing them to switch operating systems, PHP will continue to monopolize the market for beginner web developers, and hence the market for the professional developers that they turn into.",1252813273

The article makes it slightly difficult to figure out which it is.<p>In a way it only makes sense for bots to take over webservers as that gives them a better gateway to hundreds of other clients.

819781,comment,819706,819706,0,0,NathanKP,,,"I wonder why they had to clone it in the first place.  Most plants can be ""reproduced"" by taking a cutting and dipping the end in rooting compound.  Perhaps this ""oldest living organism"" isn't that sophisticated though.<p>Still, a cloned plant doesn't seem like much of an achievement compared with a cloned animal.<p>However, that said, if this plant has really survived for 43000 years then that is pretty impressive. It must have been doing an awfully fine job on its own.  That makes human efforts seem a little puny in comparison.",1252812838

In particular I found the dynamic between the programmer who made the technology and himself (who did the business development) interesting.  He made the programmer what I thought was a fair deal, worked his ass off selling, and things grew fast.  The programmer got really pissed and created all kinds of headaches.

819770,comment,817997,818846,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>Related work is motivation. It's part of the story.</i><p>It depends on the paper -- in many cases, I think that a paper can be adequately motivated in the introduction, without explicitly enumerating all the potential related work. Given that most people stop reading quite early into a paper, I think there's a lot to be said for getting to the ""Good Stuff"" quickly -- and the related work is rarely the ""Good Stuff"".<p>Perhaps related work is more important for incremental, technical results: ""problem A is important, B and C tried to solve it but their solutions were imperfect for reasons D and E, and therefore we propose F."" But when you're, say, describing a new piece of systems software, the related work is less likely to be an essential part of the motivation for the paper.",1252811396

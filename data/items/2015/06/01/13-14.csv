Perhaps there are no 10x programmers of 50 yrs, by that age they are all 100x programmers after all that accumulated experience and domain specific knowledge, at least compared to average recent grad noobs.  With the obvious exception of people with 25 yrs of experience who&#x27;ve only had 25 first years over and over again, although that failure mode is hardly limited to programming...<p>With a side dish of the widely held belief that 10x programmers can only come from selection organizations like ivy unis which primarily select (don&#x27;t get all wound up, I very intentionally selected the word primarily, not solely) based on kids winning the genetic lottery, not by working hard?  If the only way to be a 10x is to win the genetic lotto, and if the lotto winners happen to be mostly rich white males, the problem is at the academic uni acceptance dept level and has nothing to do with programming itself.  If 10x programmers can by some definition only be recent Stanford grads and Stanford refuses to admit &quot;enough&quot; minorities, the problem is very specifically Stanford, not programmers in general or education in general or culture in general.  Ready Fire Aim isn&#x27;t going to hit the right thing.  Find the correct target.<p>If an individual is &quot;born that way&quot; should he be made to feel unwanted or guilty about who they are?  Apparently if they&#x27;re gay the answer is no, and if they&#x27;re a 10x programmer the answer is yes.  This seems inconsistent, and inhumane.<p>Also it assumes that programming is only learned at uni in a purely frat boy anti-minority environment yet mythology and anecdote indicates that really good programmers are all self taught before they&#x27;re 18, and only go to uni to get the paper and polish off the highest end stuff.<p>As a completely isolated theory, it is internally self consistent, but rubbed up against pretty much every other &quot;common knowledge&quot; of tech or geek or nerd or 10x culture, it no longer is consistent.

9638453,comment,9636785,9638046,0,0,kaosjester,,,"I went to Trinity and Howland attempted to teach us J there. The entire thing went terribly. I agree with Iverson&#x27;s assessment: learning J is a lot like learning math in that mathematicians often use weird and cryptic syntactic forms that are only tangentially related to other, similar forms. Unlike APL, this problem occurs in absurd detail in J. APL, at least, has strictly different symbols. J, on the other hand, uses strangely and opaquely-overloaded syntax. By way of example, consider the following:<p>A programmer may expect < to perform less-than. In J it does, when used as a dyad. Used monadically, it acts as a boxing operator (similar to Scheme&#x27;s box). That&#x27;s strange, but livable. The problem, though, is in J, <. means &#x27;lesser of&#x27; (min), and <: means &#x27;less than or equal&#x27;. Again, this is a potentially livable arrangement. Except that . means determinant (or dot product, depending on monadic or dyadic appearance) and : means either &#x27;explicit&#x27; or &#x27;monadic/dyadic&#x27;, a sort of combinator that accepts a monadic and dyadic operator and yields a new one. That is, in Scheme, dyadic usage of : is akin to a case-lambda that checks if it uses one or two arguments.<p>If I present to you the program <., what does it do? Well, it certainly does something different from < ., which does something different from < :, which does something different from <:, which does something different from < . :, which again differs from <. :, and so on. This is exacerbated by operations such as &#x27;table&#x27;, written /, which bleed into other places. For example, </ inserts box, while <:/ inserts a decrement! And < :/ boxes up the result of an &#x27;explicit&#x27; being &#x27;inserted&#x27;, whatever that means. And this syntactic problem plagues the entire vocabulary of the language:<p><a href=""http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/vocabul.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/vocabul.htm</a><p>A clear optimization would be to just give these things their real names, use text, and write S-expressions. At least then the programs would be readable!<p>The largest problem, however, is that for being a functional language, J does little if anything to convey the important idea that have been developed in functional programming: recursion. It simply isn&#x27;t how things &#x27;are done&#x27; in J.\nSo we have a language with bad syntax, good semantics, and a horrible problem from an educational perspective. It has some nice additions above and beyond other APLs, but after that it falls flat. I&#x27;d urge anyone who has read this far to learn APL instead of J; it will at least be readable by other APL programmers.<p>(I didn&#x27;t mean to go on a rant, but I suffered through Howland&#x27;s class on J at Trinity, and it wasn&#x27;t until I had a professor show me Scheme in ~3 hours that I saw why functional programming was truly worthwhile.)",1433166220

It still feels pretty write-only to me, and I wouldn&#x27;t make any large project in it, but as a brainstorming, research and experimentation tool, it&#x27;s gold. This especially applies if you&#x27;re working with matrices or things that can be well represented by arrays of any dimension.<p>The jqt environment that comes with the standard package is polished, and encourages an interactive workflow where you progressively build your sentences while looking at the output. This way also greatly eases the learning curve.<p>Another useful tool to help learning is the cheat sheet [2]. I&#x27;m not really into dead trees but I still printed it on paper because I&#x27;m not surrounded by monitors, and it really helps to have a quick reference to the very rich and concise J vocabulary. Applying unexplored verbs to problems that interest you is a fun exercise.<p>One thing that struck me it that it&#x27;s difficult to look up examples to help you as you go, in part because the one-letter name is not search engine-friendly, but more importantly because of the small size of the J corpus out there on the web.

To satisfy static equilibrium on a given transverse &quot;dx&quot; segment of a cylinder, the walls must balance the internal pressure (in this case taken as the pressure difference), so that:<p>stress * 2 * thickness * dx = p * 2 * r * dx.<p>[ stress * walls cross-sectional area] = [ internal pressure * projected internal area ]<p>Solve for stress, you get:<p>stress = p * r / t<p>Regarding your question, yes, as the radius goes to infinity, the stress goes to infinity. The area where the pressure is applied grows with r, but the cross-sectional area where the stress is applied is still (w * thickness * dx.) This equations work well for thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessels (r > 5t is general rule of thumb). For a cube, you would have to develop the equations, but keep in mind that you will have a singularity/discontinuity on the walls because of the right angle.<p>edit: good to have a reference just in case: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/modules/pv.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering...</a> [PDF ALERT]",1433165207

It is the most important building blocks in a set of algorithms broadly known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. These algorithms are particularly useful when performing Bayesian statistics.<p>Genetic algorithms will not give you samples from a distribution, they only perform optimization. Particle swarms also focus on optimization, and on top of that, they do not seem to have either theoretical justification or empirical success.<p>MH is embarrassingly parallel since you run multiple chains at the same time. Again, the point isn&#x27;t optimization (that would be simulated annealing) but sampling.<p>Being 100 years old is also largely irrelevant. People will publish new algorithms to get publications all the time. That do not mean they necessarily outperform the old ones. Gradient descent is the basic algorithm used in training all of these cool new deep learning algorithms, and it&#x27;s much older than MH.<p>Yes, there are more recent improvements to MH, the two biggest ones being Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (which uses gradient information) and Parallel Tempering (which is somewhat similar to homotopy optimization), but that&#x27;s hardly a reason to dismiss the importance of this algorithm.",1433164829

Or others could create a new fork/project with the same functionality and possibly same api but with Windows code. It is very strange to hear open source advocates say that MS should fix everything. I thought one of the meanings of open source was that when anyone that wants something can help we will end up with almost all important projects/ideas implemented, possibly in multiple ways.<p>Regarding cloud it would be very nice if Windows worked even better in different clouds than Azure but I&#x27;m still not sure this is only MS fault. Amazon could have started earlier to offer more help and tools around this. An easier scripting language than Powershell would be nice though. Regarding running Windows without a monitor I think that has worked since Server 2008.<p>It is also a bit hard to see what MS should make money off if everything should be free. If Windows, Office, Windows Phone and developer tools should all be free it is almost only cloud and support left to charge for and I don&#x27;t think they could ever make much money on support. For cloud they will have to compete with Amazon and Google on pricing but they are probably already making money and could make a lot more here.",1433164413

It&#x27;d be terribly stupid for them to do so.<p>The free for the first year has caveats but there is no scenario where we are discussing Microsoft making you pay for essential updates in the second year. In fact, while I am not a Microsoft fan I will stick my neck out and say that it is extremely unlikely that you will have to pay for updates in consumer SKU&#x27;s of Microsoft Windows for the next six years. Seven years is typically the regularly advertised end of life and end of mainline support for previous versions of Microsoft Windows.<p>The first major caveat is that this is for existing Windows users. This offer only applies for people who currently on qualifying versions of Microsoft Windows today. If your computer came with a genuine copy of Microsoft Windows 7 or above, it is in Microsoft&#x27;s best interest that you get on board with the latest version of Windows.<p>The second major caveat is that this is specifically not for organizations. Enterprise cash cows will remain cash cows.<p>I&#x27;d urge you to be skeptical and not infer any promises Microsoft has not specifically made. However, if anyone has been telling you that Microsoft will make you pay for security updates or Windows in general beginning the second year are at best incorrect and at worst maliciously spreading FUD. Of course, Microsoft isn&#x27;t helping because there are so many details we don&#x27;t know yet such as when is the end of life for Windows 10 (assuming I accept all updates)? There is a lot of things we don&#x27;t know. However, we can say with a lot of confidence that you will not have to pay a subscription the second year of moving to Windows 10.<p>For what it is worth, I intend to update to Windows 10 on my personal computer as soon as possible. I also intend to stay on the fast lane of updates (more updates more often but possibly some buggy updates) once I get on Windows 10.",1433164214

9638205,comment,9638041,9638041,0,0,davismwfl,,,"First, I don&#x27;t think you were treated fairly.  No one should find out at the last second that the company is out of funds and unable to keep you.  It should be a dialog that is on-going for a little bit to give you options and time to prepare etc.  Their method and motive was selfish, or inexperienced (myself having done this in the past and having learned my lesson).<p>Speaking from running my own company (and from a bootstrapping perspective), it is hard to be 100% transparent.  Likely it is easier if you start that way, but it is hard either way.  I also think it is likely easier when you are well funded because Cash on Hand goes a long way to keeping people comfortable.  But there are so many close calls when you are starting out as a company that a lot of employees would likely have a really hard time with full transparency unless they also knew there was 12-18 months of runway in front of them.<p>Bootstrapping there are months that start and you don&#x27;t know where the entire payroll will come from, your job is to keep people focused and find the funds.  Many times that means not taking much or any money yourself, to make sure employees are paid.  Other times it means having to find another small contract or signup another X people etc by a certain date to cover everything.  Partners  accept this risk, but employees many times are employees because they fairly don&#x27;t want that risk.  So that is why I think more small businesses and startups don&#x27;t practice a Buffer level of transparency.  BTW -- IMO if a company is constantly having this issue then its time to talk to employees and cut back some.  And not wait until the last second as what happened to you.<p>Most other aspects of the transparency is pretty easy to do IMO.  Publishing the burn rate, churn, revenue stats etc isn&#x27;t really that difficult. Publishing peoples actual salaries is a little extreme but publishing the bands and cost of living variances is fair game anywhere.  I think when you get into cash flow and cash on hand is where things get harder for a bootstrapped business and is the primary reason most don&#x27;t publish those numbers to employees until they are quite profitable (if ever).",1433164004

They usually make an expensive PR move every few years when it looks like they run the risk of fans keeping their money in their wallets, but don&#x27;t often follow up with results.<p>Granted, Pat Burns got great results in 92/93 with a team full of scrubs when he took over the Leafs (don&#x27;t get me started on that non-call on Gretzky in 92 that could have sent the Leafs to the finals), we haven&#x27;t seen much legitimate excitement since then. Sure, the Leafs made a couple more semi-finals with Pat Quinn, but those were with significantly better teams, so much less of an achievement in my mind.<p>But the NHL is not the same as it was in the 90s. Everyone is bigger and faster, and the team hasn&#x27;t had a legitimate superstar on the team in the way that Chicago or Pittsburgh has had for quite some time. And when they have had a superstar, that guy never had much help from the rest of the team. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve been legitimate contenders for a long, long time. The best that they&#x27;ve ever been is a &quot;threat&quot; or &quot;dark horse&quot;.<p>While I&#x27;ve managed to &quot;check out&quot; on the Leafs for almost a decade now, I feel especially bad for longtime fans like my Dad, who year-in, year-out get set up with trumped up expectations for the Leafs only to be let down every single time. At least he witnessed them winning a cup before I was born though. And in two years, it&#x27;s going to be half a century without a cup.",1433163633

What exactly was the ""delirious"" part?<p>That I treated both the same, whereas China is #1 with a difference in capital punishments and the US is ""merely"" #4 or #5?<p>Sorry, but where I come from, both are abhorable, as we prefer zero (0) capital punishments anyway.<p>I don't find ""but we kill far less"" an excuse in 2013. Especially since you also kill 15 and 16 year olds (in Texas and elsewhere) or even mentally ill people.<p>><i>United States being in the top five capital punish-er list conveniently masks the fact that the top culprit, China, is in a league all by itself. Its several orders more depraved.\nIts several orders higher than the rest in the list, combined.</i><p>It's also several orders bigger. Like 4 times the population of the US. But I agree, China executes far more people even taking that into account.<p>That said, it kills their own subjects. The US does most of it's killing outside its borders. How many wars have it been involved to, in places it has no damn place to be in? How many innocent millions have it killed directly or helped be killed (by supporting tons of dictatorships all around the globe, from Pinochet to Saddam in the 80s)?<p>Oh, and the recent trend of execution by drones? That's even worst than Chinese execution. No trial, no jury, bombing, killing innocent people along (like a full wedding, with 49 dead, including 9 children), and in sovereign countries, none the less.<p>Seems like the worst offenders (warmonger, dictatorship supporter and enabler, black slavery, atomic bombs) etc, are always the most hypocritical and hollier-than-thou ones.",1367863161

5663712,comment,5663157,5663157,12,0,R_Edward,,,"I had a trig/pre-calc teacher in high school who I really respected.  He had a catchphrase in his classes, especially in the earlier math classes. ""In my class, there are only two kinds of people:  those who love math, and those who are going to learn to love math.""  I only had the one class with him, but he left a huge impression on my life.  He was convinced that computers were going to become essential to education, so he spent his department's entire budget for a year on two spankin' new Apple ][+ computers.  Just set them on carts in his classroom and didn't touch them.  He knew he didn't need to.  Eventually, a handful of us approached him to ask if he could teach us to use them.  ""No,"" he responded.  ""I don't know anything about them myself... but they came with a tutorial, so maybe you could teach yourself how to write programs, and then maybe help me out.""<p>That changed the course of my life.  I was planning to be a lawyer, catering to artists and performers.  My time spent learning to write programs led to my taking a number of computer science classes in my undergrad, for the easy grades they represented, which then led to majoring in CS, and, eventually, opting for a career in software development.<p>All of which is just to say that, if someone feels that they cannot ""do"" math, maybe they missed out on the right math teachers; those who understand kids and know how to motivate them and who have their own love for the subject matter and are able to infect others with it.  If their math teacher(s) couldn't be bothered to make personal connections with their students, nor find any way at all to make math relevant to their lives, it shouldn't come as a surprise if they wind up being uninterested in ""doing"" math.",1367863130

5663702,comment,5662846,5663094,1,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"1) Scope bloat can come from all sides. I've sat in meetings with eager-to-please devs who insisted on getting clients excited for gizmo-flavor-of-the-month x (""hey, how about we add a Facebook button to have customers share what they bought with their friends!"") to the scope of a project just to make themselves look good to their bosses, only to lament about the enormity of how much they had (promised) to do at crunch time.<p>2) Too often, there is a lack of communication between clients, devs, and project managers. If the project manager is 1) unfamiliar with development (happens a lot, actually) and 2) is unable to correctly walk a client through every nook and cranny of their requirements, then it creates a situation where the client can have expectations in mind that are at odds with the requirements that devs are given.<p>A great example would be a 'simple' payment system as part of a larger e-commerce site. The client says they have store gift cards, credit cards, and PayPal. Perfect. The dev builds the payment system for the client, and, upon demo, the client sees that there's no option for tax-exempt purchases. ""Well, 75% of our business comes from non-profits!"" ""Amazon lets you do it, it shouldn't be that hard!""<p>Then, the client notices that nowhere can you process refunds. ""Refunds weren't in the original scope,"" the dev says. ""Well, great, but now we can't use this product at all,"" says the client. Who is at fault? In the client's mind, they're so used to using websites with built in refund and tax-exempt options that it never crossed their mind to include it in their requirements walkthrough with the project manager. On the dev end, devs are very ""to the letter"" when it comes to requirements. They see credit card, PayPal, and gift card, and implement all three and call it a day.<p>In my mind, when the requirements bloat, it's a failure on the part of the project manager, whose job is to make sure that nothing gets lost in translation and to make perfectly clear the process for change management. It's a blessing when a client is tech-savvy enough to understand that you cannot miss a single detail.",1367863020

Sorry, but I think that's a gross oversimplification of the issue (which is also evidenced by the comparison to physical exercise) and the two assumptions fundamental to that opinion are just plain wrong. Namely:<p>> <i>So what do people actually mean when they say that they cant do math?  Usually they are really stating one of two things.   First, that they dont like mathematics.   Secondly, that mathematics is more difficult for them than other subjects, and that it takes a great deal more effort on their part to learn it.</i><p>He conveniently chose the two reasons that are easiest to dismiss (irony, anyone?). What he fails to account for is the fact that math education is so poor that many people don't truly understand <i>what math is</i>. Beyond arithmetic and algebra, they think it's some really complicated stuff with big numbers and funny symbols that geeky people with glasses do -- it's practically a foreign language to them, except it has a reputation for being much harder.<p>Why is this? If I had to guess, I'd say it's based on the fact that math involves a lot of critical thinking and critical thinking is very difficult to teach. Those who attempt to do so often do it very poorly, which leads students to the false belief that math is extremely difficult. On the other hand, it's very easy to teach someone to memorize formulas and plug in numbers, so that's what we're most often taught in math class. That's good enough to get us through the standardized test so we can graduate from high school, but memorizing formulas and plugging in numbers is not ""doing math"". So I believe many people are completely justified in saying ""I can't do math"".<p>What's more, people who ""can do math"" should be taking the blame for those who say ""I can't do math"" rather than using pointless semantics to wag a finger at them.",1367862765

Couldn't make the connections that were expected of them and portrayed as normal functioning for maths.<p>Maths is different to history, and many other subjects, in that regard. If you don't understand something in history, it probably doesn't have a massive list of dependencies that you're going to fail a lot of stuff in the future on.

You can still do those subjects if you don't really understand them, as long as you use the right buzzwords and hook them off the right things.<p>I suspect part of the answer may just be that admitting you can't do history or the like is different to admitting that you can't do maths in that it's unclear what someone would even mean by claiming that they can do history.

As a species, we're pretty terrible at estimating absolutes. But we're pretty good at relative comparisons.  If I hold up 2 buckets, 1 small and 1 large,and ask you their precise capacity in liters, quarts, etc., most  guesses would be off, many quite a bit.  If instead I asked you approx how much larger the large bucket was compared to the small bucket - 2x, 3x, 4x, etc., the majority of the guesses would be pretty accurate.<p>The better option when estimating is using a system that builds on relative comparisons between work items.  We use ""points"" on a sliding scale.  Not only does estimating get much more accurate - ""We think that enhancement is about 2x as  big as the one we just finished"", but the estimation process is quicker.<p>What brings the point estimation system back to calendar time measures is mapping it to how many of those points of work are typically accomplished in a fixed amount of time - basically typical throughput.  Knowing that throughout number, it's a quick calc to figure out how long it will take to complete the work.  The throughput number also takes into account all of the little things that go on during the day that no one ever remembers to account for - restroom breaks, emails, phone calls, chit-chats with co-workers, etc.<p>I've never worked on a project that estimated things with the absolute (days, weeks, months, years) scale that was accurate and didn't require death-marches at the end.

With these patterns, they are able to forecast the demand of what kind of food they need to stock.  And that being said, my friends who have worked in restaurants say that ingredient inventory management is possibly the hardest thing in a restaurant's operation.  So it's not like the restaurant industry has completely figured it out, though they do a lot better than many.  I cannot count how many times I've walked into a restaurant hoping to have some specialty dish, only to find out that they've run out of ingredients.  It happens on a regular basis to me.<p>For devs, it's slightly different.  The customer patterns may not be consistent over time because devs are not always asked to build the same thing over and over again.  Meanwhile, restaurant customers do order the same thing over and over again, so it's a lot easier to confirm the recipe timing and build order (just finished too much SC2) down to an exact science.<p>Yes, some devs may do nothing but build simple CRUD apps all month, and maybe they can get good at estimating what a simple CRUD app will cost based on their experience.

When I was using it a few months ago, I needed to draw into a temporary context then draw the result into the main canvas, because of unusual composite operations.  This worked well on most browsers, but Safari incurred a massive slowdown which, according to Instruments, was largely caused by time spent in memcpy and some sort of surface locking.  I'm not sure why memcpying relatively small images on a powerful CPU was using so much time, but a more performant implementation would use render-to-texture and not do a round trip through the CPU, and whatever their implementations other browsers had no such problems.  It was slow enough - just drawing a few 300x300 or so images at 60fps! - that on x86 it might well have ended up faster to just construct the frame in JS using array buffers; unfortunately, I was also trying to target Safari for iOS.<p>Considering that Canvas also has hard limits on what sort of effects you can implement with it, I hope WebGL is supported in Safari and IE soon.",1367860384

For different kinds of surfaces, you'll have a different constant.<p>Getting 7 cracks versus 8 in the experiment is actually a pretty good fit.  Particularly since repeating the experiment multiple times would be unlikely to give the exact same number of cracks.  (The cracking pattern does have a lot of randomness in it.)<p>What is more important is that if the sqrt scaling rule proves reasonably consistent across a wide variety of types of materials, then testing the cracking pattern for different kinds of impacts across different kinds of windshields becomes a much more tractable problem.<p>The obvious followup becomes how angle of impact matters.  My hope would be that it is something reasonably simple - such as very little is deposited by friction, so it is only the component of the velocity normal to the surface that matters.<p>Establish those two things reasonably well, and now you're in a good position to measure every kind of windshield a handful of times, and you have some useful information for forensics on all kinds of windshield cracks.",1367859837

They could easily force players into some crazy DRM, and while it would piss off a lot of people and the interwebs would explode, they would probably make more money (at least in the short term).<p>Conversely, companies like EA seem to honestly not care about anything but the bottom line. They might pay lip-service to caring about their customers, but their actions reflect that they just want revenue by any means necessary.

Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head:<p>* SPDY Multiplexing is superior to HTTP pipelining. Pipelining requires in-order responses, which leads to head of line blocking.<p>* SPDY header compression is a win for mobile, since mobile uplink bandwidth is often a bottleneck. Request header compression allows for fitting more requests into fewer packets.<p>* Mobile connections are more likely to hang, so using SPDY PINGs (<a href=""https://insouciant.org/tech/connection-management-in-chromium/#blackholed_tcp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insouciant.org/tech/connection-management-in-chromiu...</a>) will help fail fast.<p>* Multiplexing more requests over fewer connections will help with mobile power usage (<a href=""https://insouciant.org/tech/connection-management-in-chromium/#radio_usage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insouciant.org/tech/connection-management-in-chromiu...</a>).",1367859617

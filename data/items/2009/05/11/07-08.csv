FB doesn't seem to be prone to taking down the largest hate groups at all, and only when the hate is very acutely expressed in a group's title or charter.<p>Something like ""We hate all F##### Jews and want them dead"" would get taken down without much issue, but something like ""Jews are bad because of Israel and Hamas are great"" could avoid FB censorship, especially if it's very popular.<p>If breast-feeding is banned upon submission, it shows that there are resources to censor in real time. There aren't really any pure Muslim hate groups too, it seems, like there are Jewish ones.<p>I'd have to look into this further, but it does interest me.",1242028758

The ""entire undergrad CS curriculum"" has NOT changed to accommodate the shift to Python. 6.034 was the only one that changed at all.<p>6.006 does Python, but it's new and 6.046 had no practical edge to it at all. As a student who had a little bit of difficulty with the theoretical steps in 046, I can understand why they added the ""test this and prove to yourself that this makes sense"" exercises in Python.<p>As lame as it sounds, look into 6.00 - it's an ""intro intro"" programming class mostly required for Course 20 (Biological Engineering) students, but it's surprisingly robust as an introductory class - covering a lot of the topics you just listed, and well.",1242028652

Replication can be push-pull, push or just pull.  And can be scheduled or user-initiated. It automatically merges changed documents during replication.  When the automatic conflict resolution fails, then it saves both copies and requires human intervention.  Damien Katz (creator of couchdb) was a programmer for a core part of Notes until about 5 years ago.  And Notes was the major influence on CouchDB.<p>There are a ton of other good features in Notes (and a few bad ones too).",1242028383

603138,comment,602307,602468,0,0,cyen,,,"silentOpen - The only class in which the language has been changed due to the lack of Scheme in 6.001 is 6.034. As students branch out and take electives, there are plenty of opportunities to learn other programming languages - the UI class this year, 6.813/6.831 (undergrad/grad), had problem sets using Adobe Flex. My current Distributed Systems class (6.824), the Graphics class (6.837 - an undergrad elective), and the Operating Systems class (6.828) all use C++. All have the mentality, ""don't know C++? Here are some links, go learn it.""<p>There are constant opportunities within the MIT curriculum to learn other languages, and while I had the pleasure of taking 6.001, frankly - if an undergrad doesn't take advantage of any of those opportunities and leaves college only having used Python and Java, that's their flaw - not the Institute's.<p>Finally - to play devil's advocate in response to the REPL / compiler argument, of all of the assignments in 6.001, writing the metacircular evaluator gave me the least accurate representation of the power of computer programming as a whole. While it was an interesting exercise, if I had been interested in language design, I could have taken an elective more focused on the topic - as is still an option at the Institute.<p>I think your claims about the tragic decline of the quality of an MIT CS education are a bit dramatic - few MIT students seriously considering a career in computer science graduate as lopsided as you seem to believe. Your efforts may be better spent railing against why 40% of all undergrads graduate to take jobs in finance and consulting, despite the vast majority of students graduating with engineering degrees.

You don't have to ""guess"" that the object is a Point, because you can use dynamic_cast<>() or typeid() to tell for sure.<p>Second, the conclusion was false:  it <i>is</i> possible to write a garbage collector for C++.  You cited a very popular one in your response.<p>So what do we have?  You <i>can</i> tell the type of an object at runtime, and you <i>can</i> write a garbage collector for C++.  When both the premise and the conclusion of an argument are incorrect, well...let's just say that it's hard to be less correct than that.  It's Not Even Wrong.<p>As for your defense, let's be clear:  you're not suggesting that it's <i>impossible</i> to ""automatically collect the garbage of C++ programs"" -- you're arguing that it's impossible to do it efficiently.  I dispute that argument, too, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the comment that I quoted.  It's a straw-man.<p>The bottom line is that the quoted statement was absurd, and you're only setting up a straw-man (about the efficiency of C++ GCs, and about the ability to drop them into large codebases.)

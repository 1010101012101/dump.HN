I don&#x27;t do &quot;perfect&quot; home row style typing, but trying to hold left shift through that entire macro is borderline impossible for me to type -- I use my left pinkie for those As, and my left hand for reaching over to that B and that G, which is stressful holding left shift.

M has become muscle memory to the point where I reach for it even if I make the effort to hold down left shift for the entire identifier.<p>This results in, if optimized instead of tripping over my own fingers the entire time: ↓mboot↑↓-p↑↓age↑↓-↑↓align↑<p>My old iBook capslock key broke in half I hit it so often.

How about giving us a code snippet? The consensus in the CS community is that the command pattern disappears (becomes overkill) for languages with first-class functions. This has been noted as early as 1998 by Norvig when comparing C++ to Lisp. It&#x27;s one of my criticisms of Addy&#x27;s JS Patterns book.

7080628,comment,7075515,7080087,3,0,colin_mccabe,,,"I think a big part of the issue is that in Java and C++, you really need generics a lot more than in Go.  Without templates, you would not have any easy way of doing maps and lists in C++.  There are no builtin types for those like in Go.  The way the type system works in those languages also makes things very difficult if you don&#x27;t have generics.<p>Think about the sorting example I wrote earlier: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7080562"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7080562</a>  If you were writing it in Java, is sort.Sort an interface or an abstract base class?  Well, you can only &quot;extend&quot; one class (single inheritance only), so you would probably want Sort to be a Java interface.  That means that you would always have to implement all three functions, not just one as I did, since Java interfaces cannot have default implementations.  The comments indicate that most posters didn&#x27;t even consider the idea that you could reuse the StringSlice functions.  That method of easy composition simply doesn&#x27;t exist in Java.<p>In general, generics get used a lot as a band-aid to avoid multiple inheritance in C++ and Java.  You can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t, in C++) have your Foo inherit from both a (non-abstract) Bar and Baz.  But you can certainly template on them.  In C++, this kind of thing is called &quot;traits&quot; and Alexandrescu wrote a whole book about it.  It&#x27;s also why std::string is actually std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >.  In Go, you don&#x27;t need all this... you just implement as many interfaces as you like and you&#x27;re done.<p>So the Java and C++ programmers need time and an open mind to get up to speed.  There&#x27;s also another contingent of programmers that really just wants Go to be like their favorite strongly-typed functional programming language (Haskell, Scheme, SML, etc.)  I like to think that these people will eventually give up.  After all, nobody comes into every Lisp thread demanding that Lisp grow a type-checker.  People have sort of accepted that that is not what Lisp is about and that there are other languages that will give you that if you want.  Hopefully much the same will happen for Golang.",1390037965

The &quot;classic&quot; definition of a limit (convergence of a series) does not work here, because you can prove that for all n, the sum of n numbers will always be at least -1/12 away from -1/12 (on account of it being positive), so it can&#x27;t converge to -1/12 (hence S not existing).<p>However, there are techniques for assigning limits to divergent sums. these summability methods will give the same result as the classic analysis for convergent series, but will also give values for some divergent series.<p>It is similar to analytic continuation( f(x) doesn&#x27;t exist, but a limit exists in x both from the left and to the right (named y), so we sometimes say that f(x)=y ), in that it allows us to extend the resolution domain slightly. But the classic definition no longer works.<p>The one used here is zeta function regularization, which consists in the following:<p>you have a series a , and a function Za(s) = (1/a1^s)+(1/a2^s)+(1/a3^s)+(1/a4^s)+.....<p>Za is only defined for certain values of s depending on the series. But for a serie representing a convergent sum, we know that Za(-1)= a1+a2+a3+... exists. So this method will give the same limit for convergent sums as the classical method.<p>For a series with a diverging sum (a_n)=n, Za(-1) doesn&#x27;t exist, but the limit in -1 exists from both ends (by analytic continuation), so we extend the domain of Za to -1 by the value of this &quot;limit&quot; : -1/12<p>The article mentions Ramanujan summation, but Zeta regularization is actually a much more useful tool.

I am totally free not to download yoursite/ad/bigassbanner.swf when all I want is to read yoursite/article.html. I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong, and if you&#x27;re trying to trick me into downloading bigassbanner.swf anyway and I use tools to help me avoid that, you are the one who is using ethically dubious tactics, and I&#x27;m just responding to that.<p>You want me to pay for your content in any way, fucking <i>ask</i> me first, or don&#x27;t put it on the open internet.<p>And it&#x27;s not about whether or not the ads are &quot;obnoxious&quot;, that&#x27;s another red herring. I don&#x27;t like any advertising, I don&#x27;t want it, I don&#x27;t need it, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to waste my time and bandwidth downloading it, nor am I going to allow it to take up space on <i>my</i> screen or have their tracking tactics violate my privacy.<p>I don&#x27;t need any excuse to <i>refuse</i> to see ads. It&#x27;s my time, my bandwidth, my screen, my privacy, my eyeballs. Fuck ads. There is no such category as &quot;acceptable&quot; ads.<p>The only &quot;acceptable&quot; ads are the ones I choose to accept <i>up front</i>. So far, only very few sites have asked me that, and they all threw tracking shit at me when I obliged, so fuck those as well.<p>After 15+ years of onesided unethical tactics I have no interest in being in any way nuanced about it. The online advertising business fundamentally rotten, and they can go screw themselves. And with them any publisher that tries to leverage these tactics for profit.",1390036889

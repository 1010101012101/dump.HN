Bitcoin cannot be ""shorted"" which is the main reason for that happening in the real world.<p>What if many people were to need to sell their bitcoins for example if a bank in a major country decided to call in all its loans. Again as we have seen with the Cyprus Crisis you'd be better off <i>keeping</i> your bitcoin rather than selling it.<p>It's hard to see how a crash could occur without there being a major external factor influencing the decision to sell large quantities of bitcoin.<p>Even if a government was to declare it illegal, there would be nothing they could do to enforce it. Wallets are private and encrypted, and the blockchain means that no government could grab your coin.<p>I think it's more than proved it's worth, I think the price can only go up because normal currency is so open to abuse by governments - see Cyprus again.<p>Lastly,one other factor that could affect the price, is damage to the internet in some form - restricting access or the ability to buy or sell.",1364561940

There are many mechanisms involved. The mounting and contacts may undergo relief of the built-in stresses. Molecules of contamination either from the residual atmosphere, outgassed from the crystal, electrodes or packaging materials, or introduced during sealing the housing can be adsorbed on the crystal surface, changing its mass; this effect is exploited in quartz crystal microbalances. The composition of the crystal can be gradually altered by outgassing, diffusion of atoms of impurities or migrating from the electrodes, or the lattice can be damaged by radiation. Slow chemical reactions may occur on or in the crystal, or on the inner surfaces of the enclosure. Electrode material, e.g. chromium or aluminium, can react with the crystal, creating layers of metal oxide and silicon; these interface layers can undergo changes in time. The pressure in the enclosure can change due to varying atmospheric pressure, temperature, leaks, or outgassing of the materials inside. Factors outside of the crystal itself are e.g. aging of the oscillator circuitry (and e.g. change of capacitances), and drift of parameters of the crystal oven. External atmosphere composition can also influence the aging; hydrogen can diffuse through nickel housing. Helium can cause similar issues when it diffuses through glass enclosures of rubidium standards.</i>",1364561447

5460436,comment,5459973,5459973,13,0,meryn,,,"I posted this comment:\n""It's obvious that you're new to Node.js.<p>First of all, you should be aware that Async.js is a mere flow-control library. It does not offload work to separate threads, and neither is it able to parallelize work. Internally, it mostly does bean-counting (but very helpfully so).<p>As you can see in the source <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/master/lib/async.js#L359"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/master/lib/async.js#L35...</a> async.sortBy simply uses Array.sort for the actual sorting. The only reason you'd want to use Async.sortBy is if the values that the array of ""keys"" is not known beforehand (and needed to be loaded through io - asynchronously). This is clearly exemplified in the documentation. <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async#sortBy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async#sortBy</a><p>The implication of this that your call to async.sortby  can be replaced by a call to array.sort. This will remove two unnecessary runs of async.map, inflicting a potentially huge performance penalty.<p>You do need to pass array.sort a comparator function, otherwise it will sort lexicographically (see <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Referenc...</a> ). That said, I'm not sure what the actual contents of your input file is. In your .Net example, you do not seem to bother to convert the array of strings to an array of ints (or floats). I think that .Net sort will sort an array of strings lexicographically as well. Furthermore, in the node.js example, you seem to be content with returning the resulting median as an int, not as float. Do the input ""decimals"" in the input file represent ints or floats? Do they all have exactly the same amount of decimals? Are both the Node.js and .Net algorithms doing the same thing? I think not.<p>Finally, we get to Array.sort. Array.sort blocks. Depending on the multi-threading efficiency of the underlying algorithm of Array.sort (which I don't have insight in), the code may not be able to use all available system resources. Keep in mind that Node.js is single-threaded. I practically don't know anything about .Net, but I assume it will magically start new processes and or threads if the runtime deems this beneficial. For Node.js, you may want to try the Cluster api, <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html</a> . You could try seeing if performance increases by adding one or more extra server processes.<p>I can't comment about the quality of the .net code since I don't have any experience with it.<p>I think it would be fair (and very educative to others) if you'd rerun the benchmarks with \n1. Async.sortBy replaced with array.sort\n2. with both .Net and Node.js algorithms fully doing the same thing (i.e. let them both sort either floats, ints, or strings), and \n3. at least one extra server process for Node.\nI think most interesting would be if you'd made the changes step-by-step, and run the benchmarks at each step.<p>My guess is that step 1 would give the biggest difference.\nDepending on how you decide to resolve the differences in the two algorithms, performance of your .Net code may be slightly affected. It could potentially be speed up in fact, if somehow it's able to sort ints (or floats) faster than strings. The actual job of sorting probably overshadows it all though.""<p>What do you guys think of this?",1364561401

5460357,comment,5459861,5460018,6,0,MehdiEG,,,"There are two main reasons why people attend conferences.<p>For some people (typically execs, sales people, recruiters, PR people, consultants, freelance professionals, etc), conferences are mostly or entirely about networking. They don't attend the sessions or, when they do, it's because it's the only place in the venue where they can sit down and catch up on emails.<p>At larger events like Mobile World Congress, those who know how networking works don't even waste their time attending the main event. They have pre-arranged meetings with all the key people they want to meet. And when they're not in a pre-arranged meeting, they are at one of the unofficial fringe events or parties, which is where the real networking happens (and they have, of course, arranged to get an invitation to the key fringe events as the best networking events are often invite-only).<p>For others, and most software developers would fall in that category I guess, conferences are mostly about personal development. No, you won't hear anything at a conference that you wouldn't have been able to find online. But a good speaker will instill a sense of energy and enthusiasm that you would never get from reading an article or even watching a YouTube video.<p>Because you're away from your daily grind and because of the way the content is delivered (you have to sit through an entire session and listen - unlike an article, a book or a video, you can't stop half way through or skim it), you also think very differently and tend to be a lot more open-minded and receptive to new ideas. So you almost always end up learning things that wouldn't normally have bothered to even read about otherwise or that you wouldn't have properly understood.<p>Not to mention the fact that you're surrounded with people coming from very difference backgrounds and industries than those at your workplace. You'll often pick up very different ways of thinking that might very well change your approach to your work.<p>Personally, in the good old days when I was ""just"" a software developer and didn't care much about networking, I loved attending conferences. I would leave a good conference bursting with energy and enthusiasm. My best work would always happen after a conference. That's when you feel the most ready to tackle hard problems and don't mind powering through the statu-quo to make things better.<p>Try it - if you're passionate about your craft, chances are good conferences will make you a better craftsman.",1364559612

Let the staff go to their new homes, but build a team whose specialist skillset is in taking an already built product, putting it into stasis and dropping ongoing costs, and then monetising that existing tech/content/audience/userbase.

If the data recovery tools aren't mature, reliable and useful, then I'd advise anyone to stay away from a filesystem, no matter how world-ready the underlying FS code is.<p>I'm probably biased; but I got screwed using ReiserFS. It was fast and great, but one day something went wrong and then I found that the reiserfsck program was practically useless. Very little work had been done on it, so any small inconsistencies in the FS meant your data was toast.<p>Sure, keep backups and all that, but just be aware how important a good fsck tool is.",1364559205

5460306,comment,5459973,5460228,1,0,jeswin,,,"- Correct. I am saying that nodejs is slower in general. The reason you would use nodejs is to save development time, and not to extract the last drop of performance. It is for the same reason that people have written so many apps on Python and Ruby.<p>- I/O in nodejs is always asynchronous. I/O in typical .Net apps is almost always synchronous, due to programmer choice.  This approach is followed in the vast majority of Asp.Net apps. So according to you, this would imply that most .Net programmers don't know how to program in .Net.<p>- I can't follow how ""ORM magic"" is related to I/O. The ORM magic I remember has been a terrible experience for me when I had to use .Net (3-4 years back). We have to write our own ORM to replace EF, since it was dog slow. Including the LINQ expression tree parser, design-time tools etc. You can find this result here: <a href=""https://github.com/jeswin/AgileFx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeswin/AgileFx</a><p>I know that things finally got better after EF4.

Importantly, when developing new technologies, people understand that something may or may not come out of it, and they accept that (somewhat).<p>The other factors are definitely an issue too, though:<p>- Lack of physicality of the output<p>- Increased likelihood of unintended interactions between components<p>- Clients changing their mind halfway through (!)",1269165468

1207762,comment,1207392,1207710,0,0,aaronbrethorst,,,"Having a working product with positive customer feedback is no Kevin Costner Hollywood gimmick; it takes tons of hard work. 'If you build a good product that can attract users, you'll have an easier job of convincing potential employers of your usefulness' is the only point I'm trying to get across. Do you disagree with that notion?<p>I'm perplexed and somewhat disturbed by what I interpret as an assertion that <i>creating a successful product indicates a lack of software development skills</i>. Am I misunderstanding you?",1269165313
1207761,comment,1207342,1207737,0,0,jrockway,,,"When your project's size warrants it, you can switch from pull requests to an off-site mailing list.  But most projects never get there, and so pull requests are quite useful for the long tail.<p>I remember back in the sourceforge day, most projects died before they ever got a mailing list, CVS account, web page, wiki, bug tracker, ..., all setup.  Now, reasonable defaults are provided for you, and you can focus on writing the code.  Once your project has a bunch of contributers that are all working on time-consuming projects... then you can invest some time in moving away from the defaults.  But if you project is like most and has 3 users, you won't have to waste your time.",1269165221

If people think that software development is a science, they'll treat it that way, similarly, how they treat it will change if they think it's an engineering discipline or an artistic effort.<p>I've come around to the idea that software development is partly engineering and partly creative, much like architecture. Treating it like a science is the surest recipe for failure, as you'll be lucky if you ship anything worthwhile on schedule. Treating it like engineering will result in a much higher rate of success, with higher quality, and greater scheduling certainty, but will frequently result in mediocrity and developer dissatisfaction. Treating it like pure art sans engineering will probably result in lower quality, and unpredictable scheduling. But giving proper respect to the importance of both sound engineering and creativity seems like the sweet spot to me.",1269164976

I see they are doing some fixing in 3.0).<p>Coming from Hibernate and such, it may seem like a breath of fresh air, but the result of a find ain't lazy, the query language sucks making you drop to SQL even for sub-selects, and the model definitions look weird ... inferring the columns from the DB schema is the wrong approach IMHO (they should take a look at Django sometimes).",1269164850

The question you are thn overlooking is: <i>why</i> do they feel a stronger sense of entitlement?

I thought it was interesting in that after reading the article I shared some of the same thoughts but at this point that single comment was down voted and with zero as the score.<p>I up voted it back to one and ihodes had already replied asking why it was down voted.<p>So there's no visible history and he's not seeing down votes, just the final score. It's just that the first vote was a down and he responded to that.<p>He has a fair question though on down vote policy. It's very hard to see why it should've been down voted.<p>My policy is to up vote everything worthy of up voting but to only ever down vote the really irrelevant, off topic and rude posts.

1207737,comment,1207342,1207708,0,0,davidw,,,"Which is why traffic has stopped on the linux kernel mailing list, despite being long time users of git?  Nope.  All serious open source projects have some sort of discussion area.  Even github lets you comment on commits, but that's not quite as convenient to read for most people as a publicly visible mailing list/forum/whatever.<p>Git is a nice tool, but you can't take things to extremes.  It is not a substitute for actual discussion.   What happens when the patch is 'pretty good', but not quite right and both people are willing to work on it?  It just gets discussed in commit messages?  No, it goes to a mailing list, especially when it's a larger project with many interested parties.  This is pretty elementary open source stuff:-/<p>Where you're completely correct is that git and github make it easier to contribute 'at the margins'.  In the sense that what once may have simply lain idle on one's own hard drive is easier to simply throw at some project in the hopes that they can do something useful with it.",1269163090

Godel's incompleteness theorem places a theoretical limit on the completeness of (non-trivial) formal mathematical systems. 'Computations' take place within such formal systems and are, by definition, math. Both are subject to the consequences of Godel's theorems and you can't distinguish between them based on those theorems.",1269163002

Godel's theorem is on of the most poorly understood popular ideas in mathematics and its easy to trip over (for you or the reader).<p>I'm going to try to guess what you mean.  You are trying to say that since a computer is essentially a formal system and humans are something more, we can't replace human mathematicians with computers to do the work because they won't be able to come up with new ideas outside a fixed problem space?<p>In any event, I think you are misunderstanding @ihodes's question.  The question is not ""can we replace mathematicians with computers"" but is more about the practice of mathematics.  I.e., @ihodes is asking if the mental activity of experimenting and doing computations is conceptually similar to doing proofs.",1269162532

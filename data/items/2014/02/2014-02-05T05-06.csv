For all of Google&#x27;s dominance they offer APIs using open standards for the vast majority of their products, their operating systems are all open source, they guarantee to give you your data with takeout. Mostly where they are dominant it is because they&#x27;ve made products people really want and not because they&#x27;ve locked their customers in.

The fact remains that Silicon Valley is a product of these billions in government spending and wouldn&#x27;t exist in anything like its current form without it.<p>What we&#x27;re both describing is the Pentagon system. The <i>pretext</i> for investment in high tech is that we need it for defense. And then we can just give it away to the private sector because, hey, it&#x27;s like military surplus.<p>But it&#x27;s highly unlikely Silicon Valley would exist without the hundreds of billions in government investment in core high tech. The government invests in nascent tech at a much earlier and riskier stage than venture capital, often billions over a period of a decade or more. There&#x27;s also the critical role of (usually military) procurement in creating a market for early tech. This is orders of magnitude riskier and broader scale than any private VC fund.<p>You&#x27;re biggest error I think is in missing the bigger picture of how this creates a (rather disturbing) feedback loop into war policy. Doing this all through the pretext of military spending means that the public has less control over how taxpayer funds are invested in the economy and the private sector can capture all the profits, using the logic that you articulate. But it also means that we have to keep finding new enemies and waging wars to keep the Pentagon system running.",1391579593

The product we are developing is an App that will be available on both iOS and Android. My first concern is distributing the iOS app on the iTunes App Store. I don&#x27;t have a problem with Apple taking their 30% commission on my Kickstarter orders, in fact, I fully understand it and would expect the same if I provided a storefront for someone to host and distribute their apps. The problem is, I don&#x27;t think there is any mechanism for doing this currently. One possibility that I&#x27;ve considered is buying a $10.00 gift card for every backer and mailing it to them and then hoping that they use it on the app when it releases. The only major problem with this solution is I&#x27;m not sure if I can find a supplier that can sell me that many $10.00 gift cards in short order. I&#x27;m definitely looking into it though.

Allowing parallel construction would impermissibly allow law enforcement to benefit from the unlawful search.<p>> It&#x27;s also helpful to know that parallel construction isn&#x27;t a new thing. It&#x27;s similar to the process that works when the FBI/DEA has a highly-placed informant in a criminal organization. They want to make cases from that CI, but they don&#x27;t want to expose the CI, not least because they&#x27;ll have more cases to make down the road.<p>The distinction is that evidence from a CI would be admissible in its own right. Further evidence that it leads to wouldn&#x27;t be the fruit of the poisonous tree.<p>The trouble seems to be that the exclusionary rule breaks in the absence of total transparency from law enforcement. The exclusionary rule exists to remove the incentive for law enforcement to conduct unconstitutional searches. If law enforcement doesn&#x27;t have to disclose all their sources, even if parallel construction from poisonous evidence was nominally prohibited, defendants wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove it when it happened. It would reintroduce the incentive for law enforcement to conduct unconstitutional searches and thereby make the exclusionary rule insufficient. This is a hard problem, although maybe requiring a high level of transparency and disclosure from law enforcement would be beneficial in general.",1391577612

No interruption in service, no changes that affect our customers.<p>In the long term, one of three things:<p>SCENARIO 1: We&#x27;ll spin them off into separate companies where we&#x27;ll retain partial ownership, but another fully-dedicated team will run the products and own the majority of the company. This would be our ideal situation as it would ensure continuity and no interruption for our customers, but we&#x27;d have to find the right entrepreneur/team with the right experience and enough financing to make it work.<p>SCENARIO 2: We&#x27;ll sell the products outright (either separately or together). The key for us in this scenario is that the products, and our customers, are well looked after. We will not sell either of these products to a company that is planning to shut the products down. And since no one from our team goes with the sale, this is not an acqui-hire situation. We&#x27;re looking to sell to a company that wants to add well-respected, well-established, profitable, growing products to their portfolio.<p>SCENARIO 3: If we can&#x27;t find the right partner or buyer, we are committed to continuing to run the products for our existing customers forever. We won&#x27;t sell the products to new customers, but existing customers can continue to use the products just as they always have. The products will shift into maintenance mode which means there will be no new development, only security updates or minor bug fixes. We did this successfully in 2012 with Ta-da List, Writeboard, and Backpack, so we know how to make it work.<p>If you&#x27;re a company or team interested in exploring scenario 1 (spin-off) or scenario 2 (outright purchase), please get in touch. Based on current revenues, current growth rates, and a conservative multiple, Campfire will sell in the single digit millions, and Highrise will sell in the tens of millions, so serious inquires only please.

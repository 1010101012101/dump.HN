663010,comment,662200,662729,0,0,gojomo,,,"Technically, Amazon isn't paying the tax, it's collecting it. The NC customer is paying the tax.<p>And if NC is like other states with which I'm familiar -- CA and TX -- the resident already owes a 'Use Tax' on the items bought from Amazon. That tax is hard to enforce, and most people think nothing of ignoring it -- so in a sense Amazon is just assisting tax evasion by the residents who do use NC services.",1245300879

I'm assuming he isn't articulating his thoughts well. For as long as I remember there were images, cheesy animations and background music on pages around the web - long before flash and shockwave.<p>Does he mean that some people argue Flash is bad for the web because it's contents can't be indexed by search engines? Now that is a different story and a losing arguement since Adobe itself has admitted it's an issue.",1245300874

662984,comment,662692,662890,0,0,carbon8,,,"OK, ""18000+"". Same thing in this context.<p>Beyond that, there are a range of flaws with self reporting that are immediately apparent when you look at the entries and rankings. Most entries are grossly incomplete, and they are all very inconsistent. Some say ""PHP"" some just say ""wordpress"" others just say nothing more than something like ""postgresql."" The result is that ""PHP"" in the rankings doesn't actually represent PHP, even among the small number of sites that have been listed in your app.<p>Furthermore, when I looked an hour ago, Erlang was ranked higher than Ruby, and now, apparently, ""Django"" represents 10% of the entries and ""Ruby on Rails"" is ranked much higher than  ""Wordpress,"" which is ranked just above ""Rails,"" all of which are well above ""JavaScript,"" ""HTML"" and ""Linux."" And so on.<p>Normally I'd like to see any indie web app succeed and appreciate the time and effort involved in making one, but in this case the information is grossly skewed and claiming to represent something that it doesn't. People look at things like this and form opinions and beliefs on them.",1245298363

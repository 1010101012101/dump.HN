1273804,comment,1273568,1273632,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>having a touchscreen that makes things zoom by pinching.</i><p>Apple doesn't actually have a patent on pinch-to-zoom. But I'll play along anyway...<p><i>It's trivial, obvious, and there actually isn't any other useful way you could do it.</i><p>Bullshit. You're playing dumb--probably without even realizing it--but I think if you actually had to apply yourself to the problem you could think up dozens of alternative approaches. These are the ones you're pre-filtering with ""useful"" because you <i>assume</i> that they are all inherently worse, but a huge amount of that is left up to the actual execution. Is this hard? Yes. But that's why it's competition. If it were easy to think of better ideas and create better implementations than the competition, the competition would have already done it!<p>So let's try to think of some other ways to zoom with a touch screen other than pinch-to-zoom. For starters, the easy one: virtual button presses. Tap the plus to zoom in, the minus to zoom out. Ok, that's pretty lame, how about a zoom track along one side of the screen, and you just move your finger up and down it, or perform some action to select and move a marker object along it.<p>Ok, maybe that's too much motion...lets make it a kind of rocker switch where you can just swipe your finger a small distance from a center point to activate the zoom one way, or the opposite to zoom another way. That might be great if meant for thumbs, kind of like a hat switch on a joystick, but let's say we want something better for a larger surface, like a table. How about tap and hold to get a menu with a zoom option. Hmm, menus are lame. Let's make it a dial instead.<p>Ah, but that requires two motions, which might not be good, depending on the rest of our interface. Instead, how about we can just select and drag from an object corner, like any windowing interface, binding the zoom level to the scale of the object in a very natural fashion. That could work for some things, though maybe not a map unless you've got a very large screen.<p>Or maybe rather than treating our interface as simply a flat surface we lend it some depth and treat the scale of the object as distance from the screen. Then we can use any gesture or button we like to suggest getting nearer or farther from the object we're looking it. Say, a two finger swipe downward, to suggest ""come here"" or ""pulling towards"" and upwards to suggest ""go away"" or ""pushing away"". When the object gets so near that it fills the screen we can keep using that gesture to get ""nearer"" to the object, effectively zooming in on it without the user consciously even thinking of it as zooming.<p>Or hey, maybe we're overthinking this. What's the simplest thing you can do with a touch screen? Tap it, right? Maybe we could...tap once to zoom in, tap twice to zoom out?",1271541322

1273754,comment,1273411,1273411,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"In the last two years I have went from having over 500 RSS feeds in my Firefox toolbar from various bloggers to narrowing that down to maybe 50 community hub type blogs like techmeme/DIGG/Reddit and then eventually I had one RSS feed which was HN. I find the comments to be invaluable so even now it's inconvenient to read HN stories through the RSS feed, so now I don't use RSS at all.<p>I think the general principle behind feeds was always content discovery rather than loyalty to a particular author. Blogs were so effective because the likes of Coding Horror didn't just post some insight into programming but generally linked to lots of other really interesting posts that could educate and entertain for as much time as you had to burn. The only problem was if you wanted to do this every day, then it was hit and miss and your reading list for the day was too dependent on a good writer having something to say when you wanted entertained (hence the volume of my subscriptions).<p>Aggregation sites like Reddit and Digg were the next stage in content discovery but the noise ratio was far too high to replace my RSS feeds. Then the niche sites like Proggit and Hacker News pretty much eliminated my need for RSS. Whereas previously I could spend an hour reading my personal feeds and come away feeling like I wasted an hour, now I feel like an hour on HN will not only keep me aware of the emerging trends in my profession but also give me lots of interesting anecdotes from the general interest articles that are posted here. It's an invaluable source of information.<p>Content discovery is a really exciting space, and I'm really excited to see how it will evolve. Twitter is another evolution of this I think, and I think way more people use twitter as content discovery or a news source as opposed to ""what I am doing right now."" But following one of these loudmouths who retweets and links to articles suffers the same problems as RSS in that there is this tendency for one of these people to make a huge amount of tweets due to some event like a conference (or gets drunk one night) and then some stuff you don't care about pushes a lot of the stuff you do care about off your page. I only follow 25 people on twitter and if I don't check it for a day then I have 200+ tweets to dig through, so I have no idea how people with massive lists make their twitter work for them.<p>The general problem from all existing solutions I see is that they are too immediate. Aggregation sites work on a day to day basis where time of upvote plays more part than overall quality. Twitter goes out of its way to make anything other than your latest tweets hard to access. And right there at the side you find emerging trends. It's all about now, now, now.

However, the enzymes, due their shape, can't actually travel all the way down a dna strand; they don't actually copy the last little bit of dna.  If there were genetic information on the end of the dna strand, it would be lost.  However, there are telomeres which act as a protective buffer and it just so a little bit of the telomere is lost instead of genetic information.  However, because a little bit of the telomere is lost with every split, eventually the telomere shrinks and vanishes.  At that point, the cell can no longer copy itself without losing information, and so it doesn't.<p>This company seems to have found a new way to regrow the telomere in young cells.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere</a>",1271538961

I don't want this to repeat with videogames.

But when he simply says ""videogames can't be art"" without explaining what he means by art, we can only fill in the blanks with our own definitions. It's no wonder gamers get enraged by this. And they say, ""Of course games are art, look at Bioshock/Braid/Flower/etc.!"" And Ebert looks at these games not with the gamer's definition of art, but his own, and says, ""Of course these are not art.""<p>It's pointless and inflammatory and it can't possibly go anywhere constructive until Ebert defines his terms and explains just what he means when he claims videogames are not art.",1271538675
1273726,comment,1273568,1273632,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"But the whole point of the patent system is that having ideas is easy but implementing them is hard. Patents are there to encourage people to implement ideas as soon as they are widely known, rather than let them wait around for decades for some government, or charity, or perhaps even <i>nobody at all</i>, to pay for their development.<p>The problem with implementing stuff is that it's a lot harder to build something the first time than the second. It's easy to sit around in a chair and imagine the UI from <i>Minority Report</i>. It is a ton of work to actually design and build that interface, because for every feature and tweak you include in the final product you must test and discard dozens of others. (Unless your business is willing to produce poorly-designed crap, of course.)<p>Unfortunately, a designed product is much easier to copy than to produce in the first place, so every piece of R&D you do is also R&D for your competitors. The patent system tries to rectify this.<p>You complain that patents let people have an idea and then sit around charging others money. And this is true, but - importantly! - it is only true for the life of the patent, which is something like 14 or 17 years. That's the whole point. Once someone has has a brilliant idea they must either build it, or license someone else to build it, or within less than two decades the idea will be worthless. (You can also pray that nobody else has the same idea. This is usually a bad bet: ideas arise when their time is right, and lots of things are invented simultaneously by half a dozen people at once.)<p>In a world without patents, nobody has any incentive to be the first to implement anything bold - your competitors will freeload on your R&D and outcompete you. So you're reduced to tiny incremental improvements with low risk and obvious value (so that they can be sold immediately in high volume, to take advantage of the tiny time window when the innovation is exclusive to your product.)<p>The problem with software patents is not that patents are useless or don't work in general. It's that they don't work well for software, which has many degrees
of freedom and is hard to understand. It's that the standards of review are broken; far too many obvious patents are issued. The adjudication is broken: by rubber-stamping patent applications and leaving it to courts to adjudicate them, the Patent Office turns IP into a shakedown racket where the team with the largest legal budget wins. And the whole idea is just too new. If software patents had existed in 1968 Doug Engelbart would have patented everything we use today, those patents would have expired in the eighties and we wouldn't be worried about them anymore.",1271538669

1273724,comment,1273412,1273546,0,0,grellas,,,"Mandatory arbitration is a great solution for commercial contract disputes between parties of roughly equal bargaining power. Such parties are normally sophisticated and they want if possible to get to the heart of a dispute and get it decided comparatively quickly without a lot of wild-card elements interjected into it.<p>Beyond that context, mandatory arbitration has several problems. Among other things:<p>1. It takes away a party's right to a jury trial, thereby removing one of the most potent weapons available to an individual taking on a big company. I remember litigating a churning case years ago in federal court where an old couple had lost their life savings when a broker decided to use discretionary authority they had given him over their account to put them into high flyers, an obviously disastrous strategy. The big fight with the institutional defendant was over whether they could force the case to binding arbitration, and they fought hard over that one. When they lost, they instantly settled for the full amount. Why? Because juries award <i>punitive damages</i> that penalize institutional defendants for their outrageous conduct. And, guess what, a national brokerage firm that does not have the decency to pay up when one of its own has obviously fleeced a hapless old couple is just asking to get slammed. That is what happens with juries. It does not happen with arbitrators, who normally try to ""split the baby"" in making their awards - a bias that heavily favors defendants. In employment cases, the jury weapon and the potential for punitive damage awards are precisely the threats that induce employers to settle and pay up rather than fight it out if they have committed serious wrongs. When those weapons are neutered, they dig in and fight because the downside risk is comparatively small while the upside is that they can frustrate claimants into settling for comparatively low amounts. For similar reasons, where such economics hold sway, contingency-fee lawyers will be more reluctant to take on a case, leaving it to the claimant to have to pay for the costs of prosecuting the dispute.<p>2. Arbitration also takes away any effective right to do credible discovery in many cases. This means defendants can more easily hide evidence and thereby defeat meritorious claims. For all its faults, litigation does provide a potent arsenal by which one can pry documents and testimony from recalcitrant defendants. Take that away and the value of a claim is commensurately diminished.<p>3. There is also no effective appeal from a binding arbitration award. This means that, if you get a horrible decision from an arbitrator who did not understand the facts or the law, there is no way of correcting it unless you can show that factors extraneous to the arbitration process itself illegally influenced the result (e.g., if the arbitrator took a bribe). This, by the way, is why a startup should be extremely cautious in agreeing that disputes over contracts affecting its IP rights should be submitted to binding arbitration - if you get a bum decision saying, e.g., that some claimant owns those rights that you thought belonged to your company, there is no effective recourse. No appeal on the merits of the award. You're effectively screwed.<p>4. Arbitration panels can sometimes be drawn from inherently biased sources, such as ""industry experts,"" which is fine if the dispute involves a commercial contract dispute in which industry knowledge is important. In other contexts, however, the experts tend to align themselves with the companies with whose industry they are so closely familiar. They often have worked in those industries for years and therefore know and approve of its common practices. If and when someone comes along to say that liability should result from this is that standard practice, they are loathe to disturb things. Beyond that, you just have the ""good old boy"" element of people who know each other. Yes, they might do a fair attempt at rendering what they see as an honest decision, but the built-in tendency toward favoritism will inevitably seep through in such cases.<p>Of course, not all of the above points apply with equal force to an employment dispute. I set them forth, though, because I very frequently run into entrepreneurs who axiomatically assume that binding arbitration is an unalloyed good, and it is not. You need to think very carefully about how this sort of vehicle might affect your company when you agree to contract clauses that force you to submit your disputes to that forum.<p>And, from an employee perspective, such clauses are almost universally bad. Take away the jury trial risk, the risk of punitive damages, the power of broad discovery, and the ability to appeal, and you find yourself effectively trapped in a forum by which you will likely obtain limited relief at best, no matter how much you have been harmed or how good your claim.",1271538541

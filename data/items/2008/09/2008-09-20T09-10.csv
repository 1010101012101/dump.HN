While there are many lesser reasons and even some <i>against</i> using it, the weakness of password resets (as demonstrated in the Palin email crack) scream for the adoption of some sort of decentralized, user-in-control authentication mechanism.

The improved and very productive in-line search is one of the first things I noticed about Chrome, it's just plain awesome.<p>Anyway, the earmark of good UI is that nifty features are there when you need them, and when they manifest themselves they're helpful. Features that get in your way when they serve no purpose only serve to clutter and bloat; so props to the Chrome team on this one.",1221901664

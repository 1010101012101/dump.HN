It comes with a built-in graphical server management system called Genesis, which will allow users to <i>easily</i> and <i>securely</i> host websites, webapps (Wordpress/Drupal), email accounts, cloud services like ownCloud, Dropbox clones and anything else. The coolest part of Genesis is that it uses a plugin interface, so anyone who has a new project that they want to manage only needs to whip up a quick script in Python and it can be easily integrated into the rest of the application. Genesis was initially a fork of another server management app called Ajenti, but now extends its features and takes it in a more comprehensive direction.<p>arkOS is similar to two other projects that have been in the spotlight lately - FreedomBox and Space Monkey. It differs from FreedomBox because it is not focused on redoing existing networking systems. It is simply dedicated to hosting your data and does not try to reinvent the wheel. It also puts a premium on user experience - it is designed to require as little command-line work as possible in order to maintain it (ideally zero). It differs from Space Monkey because it allows you to actually <i>serve</i> the content you put onto it, rather than just serving as a media storage system. While both of these tools are very exciting and important steps to &quot;liberating&quot; the cloud, I believe that arkOS fills an important niche in between the two.<p>EDIT: Regarding how it can prevent against gov&#x27;t/corporate spying like with PRISM: The idea is that it would provide an easy alternative to the services that are provided by these large companies, i.e. Google Talk (or whatever they call it nowadays) replaced with an XMPP server, Gmail replaced with self-hosted email, Dropbox replaced by your own self-hosted instance of ownCloud, etc. The only part of PRISM that it might not provide a defence against would be big social networks (Facebook et al), but you would still be able to host your own StatusNet instance or Tent server on your arkOS server and have alternatives that way. When services can be decentralized and brought back under individual user control, a &quot;direct link&quot; into major web company&#x27;s servers is definitely made irrelevant.<p>If anyone is interested in this project or would like to stay apprised on its status, I encourage you to check out the links below. I have many more things in the works for arkOS, including a system that helps people get around port blocking and dynamic DNS issues, something that prevents a large number of people from self-hosting their data.<p>Thanks for reading :)<p>--<p>Free The Cloud: <a href=""https://ark-os.org/cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ark-os.org/cloud</a><p>Project Website: <a href=""https://ark-os.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ark-os.org</a><p>Github repo for Genesis, the server management GUI: <a href=""https://github.com/cznweb/genesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cznweb/genesis</a>",1370613144

I guess the CPU emulator was a simple state machine, but the interesting thing in this context is how it did the graphics and sound. Having a pretty advanced &quot;PPU&quot; of its own, with the same basic types of features (sprites, tile indexing background layers), it translated the PPU register writes (with appropriate scaling, I guess) to native register writes. I&#x27;m not sure how things like collision interrupts were handled, but presumably the GBA has similar functionality. For a javascript emulator or static recompilation, similar methods could be used to set up a bunch of shaders dealing with the basic functionality of the PPU (sprites, tile layers etc). Certainly less accurate and probably missing a bunch of corner cases, but it would definitely be the fastest approach to dealing with graphics emulation.",1370612394

The problem with Facebook is that it is personal details specifically organized into a dossier-like format.  It&#x27;s one thing for the NSA, for instance, to be able to tap into the hose of undifferentiated data streaming through the network.  It&#x27;s quite another thing for that data to be specifically organized for the purposes of quickly discovering key information about somebody, such as their social network, their political interests, their latest photos, etc. all indexed and searchable.  Think about the cost of taking Gmail&#x27;s data and turning it into something useable by intelligence organizations -- work that FB &quot;empowers&quot; us to do for them!<p>What we need are tools that allow us to connect in ways that are difficult not only to detect but also to make sense of (not necessarily encryption, but an ad-hoc format that can&#x27;t be easily parsed and aggregated). We need the ability to use the network for our own particular, peculiar interests rather than having to fit our interactions into some other authority&#x27;s template for <i>their</i> interests.  The idea that social networking never occurred before Friendster, FB, MySpace is ridiculous -- it just happened more informally before.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a return to this informal mode of using TCP/IP, where the internet itself is the social network rather than merely a transport layer for some centralized system.  This may make it harder for everyday people to benefit, but it also means they learn how to drive before they use the roads.  Social networking&#x27;s hyped-up promise has always been to passively connect people, but the promise of the internet has always been to allow people to actively connect (or not connect).

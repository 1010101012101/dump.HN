I'm going to the one in Lublin.<p>Probably nothing's gonna change, but lies of the governament are too much. They say in TV and radio that ACTA won't change a thing in Polish law.

Even when a bus goes from exactly where I am to exactly where I want to go with no transfers or half-mile walks in the middle (which, incidentally, is almost never), I still have to conform my schedule to the bus's.  If it runs every ten minutes, that's no big deal, but if they run every 40 minutes (like my school's shuttles) or every 20-60 minutes (like the CTA is wont to do), that's just not going to work.<p>My most frequent use of my car is a trip that takes 40 minutes through the city by car, and 2+ hours by bus/train.  I would love it if the CTA managed to increase frequencies and fix all the slow zones on their track.  It's just never going to happen.",1327571822

It was a really decent movie, but it was really poorly marketed. The cover art is a woman frozen in a state of undress (with the title obscuring her bare breasts), and the description of the plot talked of a bored employee at a grocery store with the ability to freeze time who used the frozen time to undress customers and sketch them nude.<p>I was curious, as many men would be, but I didn't want to watch it because I didn't really want that to be the first thing on screen in the ""recently watched"" list when my girlfriend turned on Netflix.<p>In fact, I only ever watched it because Netflix later recommended it to me as ""mind bending"", which seemed like an odd description of the boob-filled teenage sex romp it seemed to be. I looked it up on Amazon and discovered the real plot, and decided to watch it anyway.<p>The frozen time nude artistry was mostly contained to a single throwaway scene (the time freezing was also initially presented as a time-passing fantasy rather than a real ability, though the film does play fast and loose with that line as the movie progresses), but it still made me hesitate because of the ""recently watched"" list.<p>I have no idea how I'll get away with watching Barbarella.",1327570843

Those languages wouldn't need gem, easy_install, or cpan if they could always count on apt or rpm.  But once the scripting languages implement their own packaging system, it becomes painful to integrate with the distribution packaging systems, so they just say ""screw it, ignore the distributions and install it yourself"".",1327570625

3513449,comment,3513298,3513298,7,0,JoshTriplett,,,"This looks like the standard set complaints made by most scripting language upstreams at most distributions, with the added complication that because so many distributions have essential core functionality that needs Perl, they want a minimal subset that supports that core functionality without including the entire distribution.  Debian ships a ""perl-base"" which includes just enough Perl to run dpkg and other core utilities.  (One of these days that might change, with more and more of those utilities rewritten in C, but it won't change anytime soon.)<p>While this post starts out with the classic ""compile/install your own Perl"" line that most other scripting language upstreams spout, it later reverts to the sensible position that distributions just need to provide some package which pulls in the full Perl distribution.

NextStep had an unused memory slot while handling font properties, so that's where the link got hacked in, almost  la hypercard, dead-simple ""programming"".

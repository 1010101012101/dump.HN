I&#x27;m not going to comment on the drink, but rather on his misunderstanding of medicine.<p>First, EGFR is not &quot;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor&quot;, rather is it estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is a metric of kidney function and is derived entirely from age, sex, and Cr.<p>Second, all his labs are normal, well within the range of normal and stay normal after two weeks. There is normal daily fluctuation (for example, my Cr will probably go from 1 to 1.2 just by not drinking water for a day) which the labs show. All the changes he mention in his metabolic panel does not even register to me as changes and most likely would happen had he ate a regular diet.<p>Third, the body is a powerfully homeostatic system, even had he not ate for two weeks, most of the labs he got would stay the same. Recently, on HN there was the article of the guy who didn&#x27;t eat for a year - his BMP would have been similar. The only potentially reasonable medical test to get would have been the lipid panel, which stayed grossly the same.<p>Finally, a DEXA scan is really silly in this scenario. It&#x27;s for old ladies and others at risk for osteoporosis. Your bones are a large of reservoir that it wouldn&#x27;t put a dent on your Ca levels even if you had no Ca for two weeks, and even if it did, it would not show up as a meaningful change on a DEXA scan.",1377049994

The batteries are a variety of potential difference spread over a large area and will go on fire rather then discharge everything at once, which is an issue, but they will not explode with their total chemical potential, not even close. It is any big fat capacitors that you have to worry about.

In fact, I probably would not at first even realize that I need to instruct viewers on other platforms to interact with the content in any unusual manner.

It also seems unlikely that soylent is better than quality whole food.<p>I take Nassim Taleb&#x27;s approach. We dont know what we dont know about food. Id like to address two of Shanes points. I&#x27;m listing the objections Shane raises, then his reply:<p>Shane&#x27;s first point:<p>Objection: The body needs whole foods, not atomic nutrients; the synergy between diverse ingredients is what matters in nutritional uptake.
Shane&#x27;s reply > This sounds nice, but has not been scientifically proven. (Shane links to the naturalistic fallacy)<p>My reply: Its true that nature doesnt prove something is good. We can nonetheless have a strong presumption that the body does best on whole foods.<p>We have thousands of years of history of humans doing well on whole foods, and zero evidence that the human body can do as well on artificial foods.<p>Nassim Taleb would tell us there is a presumption in favour of natural system that has stood the test of time. Human biology is very, very complex. If whole foods serve it well, they may do so for reasons we can fathom.<p>One problem for Soylent is that it would have to prove itself safe on the timescale of a human lifetime. Thats very, very hard to do.<p>Shanes second point<p>Objection: We dont know what we dont know about nutrition (i.e. Soylent might be unexpectedly harmful).
Shane&#x27;s reply > Thats not a good reason to not try to innovate. Why not do some tests?<p>My reply: See my point above. How can you test that Soylent is better than whole foods? There is a massive potential for false positives.<p>With natural foods, if something seems effective, it probably is. We would have discovered poisonous or second order effects long ago.<p>With an artificial food like soylent, it could appear effective for, say, ten years, while introducing a variety of malignant effects.<p>Or maybe it is totally healthy. I have no idea. How can we know? You cant prove a good is safe without using it for a long, long time.<p>That said, I would expect soylent to be better than a diet of pure artificial junk food, as many americans eat. Theyre also engineered foods, but in that case we can positively identify the harm.<p>One additional problem of soylent: the designers assume we need a steady inejection of the same macronutrients every time we eat.<p>We know positively that this is false.

Its just obvious to me that a scroll bar should be vertical when you scroll vertically.<p>I can also offer some reasoning: when the scroll bar is vertical, it moves in the same direction as the direction of your scrolling movement on the mouse. This makes it easier to mentally connect your fingers scrolling movement to the scrolling on the screen, which makes the device use easier and more intuitive. In the case of iOS and OS X 10.7 and later, your finger movement is in the same direction as the content rather than the scroll bar, but its still something on the screen moving with your fingers.

However, I think we have reached a minimal point where browsers have already stripped down as far as they can.<p>Looking at a browser like Google Chrome basically all that is left is tabs, forward and back buttons, refresh button, search/url bar, HTTPS indicator, and right hand menu button.<p>We couldn&#x27;t get rid of the back and forward buttons because while JavaScript navigation works inside the page, it doesn&#x27;t work very well to go back from your site to the site that the user came from, because security is designed to prevent you from easily reading history.<p>Additionally the refresh button couldn&#x27;t be replaced by an in page control because if the JavaScript in the page has an error and stops working the refresh also stops working, which would make people unable to refresh the page.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t trust an HTTPS icon that was powered by JavaScript inside the page so that also has to be part of the chrome.<p>The only item on that list that could be removed is the right hand menu button. And since that does stuff like print, bookmark, and settings that also doesn&#x27;t work as part of the webpage itself.<p>But who knows? Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and we&#x27;ll find a way to strip the browser down even more, but I don&#x27;t think that will happen until we develop voice, gesture, or thought controlled interface devices that are faster and more efficient than typing into a search bar or clicking a button. Then we can get rid of all the buttons and controls completely. But at that point the entire experience of browsing would be extremely different, not just the browser chrome.",1377047818

Importantly, your lot in life would not depend on where you were born, since there would be no immigration barriers.  And there would be the full spectrum of political choices available.<p>Why is it such a problem that the US government collects taxes from a population earning fiat currency in an economy that the government provides?

The problem is that you are dead set on your perceived &quot;true meaning&quot; of the word, and you cannot get past anyone using a different definition regardless of how explicit they are about it. My argument is not that the string of letters &quot;politics&quot; is bad, which would then require me to set a precise definition of the word to make my argument fit my other beliefs. My argument is that government is bad, and that participation in government, even with good intentions, is bad. &quot;Politics&quot; is the perfect word to use when referring to &quot;participation in government,&quot; so I used that term. When people brought up a potential different definition of &quot;politics,&quot; I immediately gave the definition I was using in my first claim. That should be the end of the semantic argument, but people persist, many ignoring my actual claim.<p>> All colors are bad, white is especially bad, therefore only the absence of color is good.<p>Nothing I said is remotely of this form. I said politics are bad, then I defined politics as precisely as I could, period.<p>> You&#x27;re doing the same thing when you deny that an individual under absolute anarchy is equivalent to a state - presumably a state requires two or more people for you.<p>Wrong again. If you desire to enter into a discussion about states using a definition of &quot;state&quot; that includes individuals, then so be it. We could have that discussion without having any semantic arguments. You still cannot get past the idea of &quot;true meanings.&quot; The point is to speak and discuss things <i>given an agreed upon set of definitions</i>. In theory, all the words you use could be pure gibberish, provided that all participants were aware of their definitions in that discussion. Obviously, that&#x27;s not the easiest way to have a discussion, but then again, neither is this thread.<p>> It&#x27;s fine to discuss the form of government you like most - maybe anarchy is great - but it&#x27;s intellectually dishonest to portray it as superior to all other governments because for some magical reason it is not a government and therefore does not contain any of the supposedly evil properties of governments, namely submission to the authority of another which inevitably gets abused.<p>This is another disagreement on the definition of terms, and we cannot continue this discussion until we agree on a definition. My definition of &quot;government&quot; does not include voluntary organizations. If you present your definition, then I could agree to use it (just for this discussion, of course), and then we could talk about whatever you <i>actually</i> want to talk about. Again, in this paragraph, you are appealing to your perceived &quot;true meaning&quot; of the word &quot;government,&quot; and until you provide that definition, you haven&#x27;t really presented any ideas that can be intelligently discussed.<p>> What you propose entails one of the most sinister consequences, namely that an individual&#x27;s own authority, strength, and material wealth will be the final arbiter of power.<p>Here, you depart from making semantic arguments and instead make a simple straw man argument. I never claimed to advocate that, and I do not advocate that.<p>> My ideal is the exact opposite of global anarchy: one government, one currency, one set of rights, and no borders.
> But we can&#x27;t have a reasonable discussion if my ideal is a priori terrible because it&#x27;s political, and your ideal is wonderful because it&#x27;s non-political / apolitical / whatever.<p>But as I have pointed out numerous times, I&#x27;m the one <i>not</i> making <i>a priori</i> arguments based on a string of characters like &quot;political&quot; or &quot;government.&quot; I&#x27;m providing definitions and using those to construct actual ideas, rather than appealing to &quot;true meanings.&quot; I have not and will not design an argument by placing a label on your proposal containing the string of characters &quot;political,&quot; then pointing and saying &quot;See! It&#x27;s political therefore it&#x27;s bad.&quot; Nor do I place a label on my proposals then argue that they are good because of what the label says. Those would be semantic arguments, and I seem to be one of few people in this thread <i>not</i> making semantic arguments.",1377047505

Immutables have many of the benefits of value types for the compiler, plus a few more. Mutable and immutable values have identical semantics other than that fact that you can&#x27;t change an immutable value, which makes the programming model much simpler (all values have reference semantics), while giving the performance of value types for immutables since the compiler is free to pass them by value when it sees fit.<p>I believe Dylan allows you to inherit from concrete types by structural inheritance  i.e. tacking fields onto the fields of the parent type. in Julia all concrete types are final you cannot inherit from them. I haven&#x27;t found that tacking fields onto a structure is all that useful; sharing behavior is far more useful than sharing structure, and delegation is generally a better way to share structure.<p>Abstract types in Julia are essentially what OO researchers call traits:abstract types that you can program to. I don&#x27;t think that Dylan has traits. These are crucial to much generic programming (the other kind of generic programming is writing generic code for parametric types; although these are actually the same thing in Julia).<p>Dylan supports multiple inheritance, while Julia does not. We might add multiple inheritance in the future or not: so far it&#x27;s not terrible to live without it, although there are a few places where it might be nice. In the meantime, duck typing will suffice, and once the standard library is complete and stable it will be much easier to assess if we really need multiple inheritance or not; if the standard library doesn&#x27;t need it, I think the rest of the world can live without it.<p>The biggest philosophical differences seem to stem from:<p>1. Dylan was created in a time when OOP was new and hot and had to be included; Julia doesn&#x27;t really care much about OOP generic and functional programming are much more important.<p>2. Dylan tends to give you lots of options (e.g. single or multiple dispatch, static or dynamic), whereas Julia tends to give you a single option, but it&#x27;s the most powerful one (only dynamic multiple dispatch). This keeps the language simpler and easier to learn and use, but no less powerful.",1377046844

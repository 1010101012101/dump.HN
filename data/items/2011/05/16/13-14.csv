A debugger allows live autopsy, which is far more valuable than this silly print-statement thing--when your print statement does not return as expected, you are not much better off with your print statements than just seeing the broken output of the program.<p>Couple live autopsy with live edit-and-continue and you've got a recipe for a considerably more effective way of debugging code.<p>And ""your code is too complicated and unmaintainable if you need a debugger"" is preposterous on its face if you've ever...oh, I don't know...written a driver?

What adult would visit a site called ""My Bank Sux""? None that I know of.<p>I'm not trying to be rude or disrespectful - you asked for feedback so here it is - so please take this in the spirit you asked for it. That was a huge decision (the name of your company) and you got it incredibly wrong IMO. And you got it so wrong that it makes me wonder what other decisions you got wrong as well. I'm not trying to be a dream killer but you will look back on this 10 years from now and think, ""What were we thinking? That was an awful name!""<p>Lastly the whole concept of a complaint-based site is so... strange to me. Why would anyone ever visit your site except to make a complaint? Are you expecting people to just drop by and read the complaints/comments? I can't imagine that anyone would want to just read complaints and resolutions.<p>Lastly, even if you got traction from submitters, how do you make money? You want to ""create the easiest way to submit a bank complaint"" which means you'll need to minimize page time and page views to do so. It also means you can't serve ads on those pages, right? That would totally break the UI and possibly your trust with your user. The only time you can serve ads is on the post-submission pages or through email. Seems a hard way to make money IMO considering that those people will not be back to your site again until the bank responds (and that's iffy). Also, any response from a bank will be to take this off of the forum/site and will end with, ""Please call us at ..."" which totally takes any future revenue away from you.<p>Kill it.",1305551703

2552406,comment,2552180,2552377,4,0,fexl,,,"The seed was planted back in 1989 when I read a paper by Jrgen Steensgaard-Madsen in Communications of the ACM titled ""Typed Representation of Objects by Functions"" (CACM, January 1989, Volume 11 Number 1).  I found it brilliant and I never could shake the idea after that.<p>Even something as lowly as a <i>bit</i> (Boolean value true or false) can be represented as a function.  In Fexl, the functions for T and F are expressed as:<p><pre><code>  \T = (\T\F T)\n  \F = (\T\F F)\n</code></pre>\nIn short, the T function returns its first argument, and the F function returns its second argument.  So you can do things like this:<p><pre><code>  eq x 4 (print ""Yes, it's 4"") (print ""No, it's not 4"")\n</code></pre>\nYou don't even need an ""if"" function.  Or, if you like the way ""if"" looks, you can define it as the identity function:<p><pre><code>  \if = (\x x)\n</code></pre>\nThen you can say:<p><pre><code>   if (eq x 4) (print ""Yes, it's 4"") (print ""No, it's not 4"")\n</code></pre>\nYou can also define ""lists"" as functions.  There are two cases, ""null"" and ""cons"":<p><pre><code>  \null = (           \null\cons null)\n  \cons = (\head\tail \null\cons cons head tail)\n</code></pre>\nNow if you have a list called ""groceries"", you can do this:<p><pre><code>  groceries\n    (print ""You don't need anything at the moment"")\n    \head\tail\n      print ""You need ""; print head;\n      print ""and possibly some other things.""\n</code></pre>\nIf you aren't comfortable ""calling"" a list object as a function, you can define the more familiar ""observer"" functions:<p><pre><code>  \empty = (\list list T \_\_ F)\n  \head = (\list list undef \head\_ head)\n  \tail = (\list list undef \_\tail tail)\n</code></pre>\nThen you could say:<p><pre><code>  if (empty groceries)\n    (print ""You don't need anything at the moment"")\n    (print ""You need ""; print (head groceries);\n      print "" and possibly some other things."")\n</code></pre>\nIf you want an ordered pair, here you go:<p><pre><code>  \pair = (\x\y \pair pair x y)\n</code></pre>\nNow you can say:<p><pre><code>  \the_pair = (pair 2.6 3.8)\n  ...\n\n  the_pair \x\y\n    print ""left is "";  print x;\n    print ""right is ""; print y;\n</code></pre>\nSo, to sum it all up, I am just irresistibly attracted to the utter profundity of this concept.  I like how the components of a piece of data simply ""present themselves"" to the handler function(s) applied to it.  Also, you can name your data constructors anything you like -- there are no ultimately predefined names for anything, except any primitive combinators built into the C code, but even these can be shadowed or hidden.  So if you want to use ""item"" and ""end"" instead of ""cons"" and ""null"", you can.  (I do.)  And if you want to use ""first"" and ""rest"" instead of ""head"" and ""tail"", you can.<p>If you like, you can download the code at <a href=""http://fexl.com/code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexl.com/code</a> .

But the UI alone as a stand-alone web app is easy to replicate and not very sticky. As a next step I would build a plugin for Google Calendar and Outlook using the same data visualization concept. This would help users figure out which times to suggest for a call with someone in a different time zone, and they would be able to generate an invite right from  the plugin. Then I would introduce scheduling interaction between users through the plugin. For example if user A uses the plugin to suggest a time for a call with person B in a different time zone, person B would benefit immensely if he/she could not only accept/decline but also see what other times are available purely from a time zone perspective (ideally also taking into account other appointments that user A has). This would increase stickiness and virality while also allowing you to establish a business. Not sure yet whether contextual advertising using call subjects or a subscription model would work better.<p>Come to think of it, this is all pretty trivial but I had fun thinking about it.

233737,comment,233172,233629,0,0,chandler,,,"I didn't like the shell either, until I realized that it's still an editable buffer.<p>For example, you can take the output of a command, transform the text directly using standard editing commands, fix the weird one-off cases manually, and then pass the results back to the command prompt.  Or save the results to a file.  Or interleave with code.  (etc)<p>Turning the entire shell into a fully editable/scriptable/keyboard-macro-able scratchpad is a beautiful thing.",1214963360
233736,comment,233166,233678,0,0,webwright,,,"FWIW, I <i>love</i> the idea of a bootstrapped business serving a niche audience...  I guess my main point is that there is a fork in the road for startups-- if you want to get funded, you are almost certainly NOT going the niche route.  For investors to get excited, yoou need to start getting monomaniacal about attacking a huge opportunity and building a huge business.  Investors need to hear a story that involves them getting a 10x return (or at least the potential of it) or they almost certainly aren't buyin'.<p>Either way-- grats on what you've built!",1214963130

For some environments that's not true at all.<p>Which is true of nearly every commerical software environment out there. Why does Lisp get such a brutal grading compared to something like MS's CLR or Cocoa? Those are definitely commercially viable platforms that also don't meet these requirements.",1214962051

233717,comment,233172,233673,0,0,brianloveswords,,,"I tried to like TextMate very hard.  Coda is even better, like TextMate on PCP.  Oh how I wanted to love Coda, but I just couldn't do it.  It felt like having a one-night stand with the most beautiful 21 year old, all the right curves in all the right places, but you know she would make a terrible mother for your children.  Emacs: the perfect mother.<p>Another analogy, this one for bike lovers out there: Emacs is like a Brooks saddle, because it's wildly uncomfortable to start with, but if you stick with it and work into it, it's the only saddle that conforms to <i>your</i> body.  Once you break it in, you can never go back to another saddle for long rides, no matter how new and awesome it looks.",1214961464

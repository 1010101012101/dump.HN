He/she becomes your subordinate. And you will make a part of your profit from his/her work. That&#x27;s a lot of reasons to treat the employees with respect.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a slip of the tongue or a figure of speech or whatnot, but you are already showing suspicion and disrespect for your future employees in saying that you won&#x27;t be able to &#x27;get rid of them&#x27;. You want to be your own boss and created your own company, that&#x27;s fine ; you owe nothing to anyone , great for you. If you take an employee though, you&#x27;ll be owing something to someone, who will become your subordinate and work for your profit. You will pay them less than they produce in value. You will choose when and how much to raise their salary. You will be able to put pressure on them, tell them they don&#x27;t work good enough, you will assess them, and judge them. They will work 6 months for you in trial period when you have complete right to &#x27;get rid of them&#x27; with no justification. And then yes, they might earn their right to have a stable relationship with you, because they also have a right to a stable life, with stable income, so that they also can make life plans. If you are not in position to provide that, you should contract with freelance workers until you are sure you can.<p>If you do things right, though, and consult regularly with a lawyer when you need to create, alter or end an employment, there is no reason things will go wrong. There are a  lot of obligations from an employer that, when not followed to the rule, can be taken as an advantage by a well counselled employee. So choose a good lawyer, not an old one (they generally don&#x27;t work themselves anymore and make younger ones work for them - and are more expensive), with specialty in social law who does not defend only employers. (I might be able to refer to a good one in Toulouse if needed.)<p>It is generally considered that prud&#x27;hommes courts are prone to strange decisions, because the prud&#x27;hommes counselors are not professional judges, but a. you can appeal (it costs 35€), b. you don&#x27;t risk much if you follow sound legal counsel, c. the aim is to not have to get there, and you have plenty of room to have a fruitful relationship with your employees. Respecting them is the first step.",1433145230

This was usually restricted to certain groups, but due to the nature of &quot;cross-posting&quot;, it would often spread all over the place - in fact, people would quite often randomly add &quot;nice&quot; groups into a massive flamewar just to cause trouble.<p>Sometimes the police would be involved, too, but they never did anything - from what I can remember - because usenet didn&#x27;t have real-life celebrities on it (apart from a few sci-fi and fantasy authors) and was fairly incomprehensible in comparison with, say, Twitter or Facebook.

(I&#x27;ll get to that in a moment.)<p>In this case, specific people choose to act badly toward Mr. Shaw, anonymously. I would think they would continue to do this in a different venue, if their ability to do it on HN were removed. (By stating this, I&#x27;m trying to short-circuit all the talk of whether HN is a place that incentivizes or disincentivizes such talk by banning people, etc. In the end, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if such talk is discouraged <i>on HN</i>; the talk will still be generated somewhere else, and will percolate around the internet until it reaches Mr. Shaw all the same.)<p>On the other hand, HN could help Zed figure out who is anonymously slandering him. HN could put him in touch with these people. They would probably stop after even a plain small-talk conversation, due to having generated even a shred of empathy for the man.<p>But is this HN&#x27;s responsibility? Maybe! Right now HN is just barely moderated at all, and even that&#x27;s a step up from when it was pg&#x27;s hobby that he had no time for.<p>HN would be a very different place if it was trying to behave in a &quot;role model&quot; fashion toward the tech community. Maybe you&#x27;d have to tie your (long-lived, active) Facebook/LinkedIn profile to your (thus forced-to-be-unique) account, which the mods would then see even though you&#x27;d then get a choice of pseudonym. Maybe &quot;throwaway accounts&quot; would only be a temporary privilege granted by asking a mod to make one for you in an exceptional circumstance, and only exist within one post-thread. Etc.<p>I can certainly see ways in which HN could be systematically less <i>tolerant</i> of abusive behavior—trying to stop it at the source, rather than just making it go somewhere else. But is this a fight YC wants to fight?<p>I could see this ending with HN being handed over to its own community under some foundation, because YC doesn&#x27;t want to take responsibility for shepherding the tech community in the way I&#x27;m talking about. I could also see YC think that doing exactly what I said above would be a great PR move. What I can&#x27;t see is HN being shut down: if it was, everyone here would just flock to another place (Lobste.rs?) and continue to be the same community.",1433143928

But I came to the same conclusion as the author: thinking in code is a completely different process than drawing things and trying out how your site might look like. My best advice is: draw on paper first, using just a pencil and an eraser. This forces you to focus on structure and relationship rather than pixel-perfection. Hence, by going analog, you focus on function rather than on design as the critics say.<p>What you do next is up to your preferences. I think it is worth it to transform your sketches to wireframes. In most of my cases that was still a more open process than fitting the sketches into CSS directly - especially if you have designers, business people and coders involved.<p>One possible solution for wireframing that was already available in 2012 is Illustrator or InDesign. Both have global colors, symbols for reusable content and are vector-based so you can scale it for your responsive designs.<p>There are less good ressources on wireframing with Illustrator, but I found these two most helpful:<p>- <a href=""http://www.designsprint.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designsprint.net/</a>\n- <a href=""http://design.tutsplus.com/articles/10-tips-for-building-wireframes-with-illustrator--cms-19984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://design.tutsplus.com/articles/10-tips-for-building-wir...</a>",1433143663

I know the team that built it, they are friends, and we both invested crazy amounts of time in trying to keep AMQP alive. RabbitMQ is an excellent product, built with cool technology. The protocol is not so good. I designed it, I know its weaknesses. It is way too complex, and strangled by a committee that could not innovate and preferred to bully and lie its way to a &quot;1.0&quot; version that broke everything and delivered so little it&#x27;s barely a messaging protocol, let alone &quot;advanced&quot;.<p>It is fun to compare products. The competition between RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ was deliberate, useful, and good for both projects. However for a breakaway project to claim &quot;we&#x27;re the successor&quot; is downright silly IMO. Hostile and negative, and sets a terrible tone for a young project. And if you can&#x27;t achieve that, what then?<p>I find this rather sad, and looking at Nano&#x27;s commit history, another of those entirely predictable stories. Why would you want to supercede the ZeroMQ community? It&#x27;s large and successful and friendly. Why not simply make a better ZMTP engine? Make it smaller, cleaner, compatible, and then over time, improve the protocols... simple and undramatic and guaranteed success.<p>But no, we need drama and argument and hostility and... no matter how good the code, the outcome is that contributors don&#x27;t stick, the core developer gets burnt out, and the project dies.<p>It happened to Crossroads, and Nano appears to be really just the same, in C. The waste in time and effort is sad. We need projects like Nano. We need space for new experiments. We need choice and competition.<p>I&#x27;ve spoken to some Nano contributors who are replacing Sustrik (who seems to have abandoned the project), and things may improve. One hopes.",1433143623

For other cases, you need a mix of stable and unstable pieces, and so CZMQ has a zgossip class that does this.<p>It&#x27;s an emergent problem. One good pattern that&#x27;s emerging are clusters of clusters; e.g. each box supports a cloud of small services that talk to each other and to a single broker on the box, and the brokers on a network then discover each other opportunistically with a mix of broadcasts, manual assistance, and gossip.",1433142808

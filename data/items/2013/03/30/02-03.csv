People rant about how terrable the US education system is but the United States places 17th in the developed world for education, according to a global report by education firm Pearson. That's well into the 90th percentile.<p>Uh, no. The U.S. placed 17th out of 50 countries in the developed world. As the other 145 countries in the world weren't part of the study, there's no saying where the US would have placed if the whole world were studied. Among the studied countries, the US wasn't in the 90th percentile, or even the top third.",1364612381

5464163,comment,5464090,5464090,1,0,jellyksong,,,"<i>Server is down, full text:</i><p>As the arrival of decision letters starts to taper off, most of my friends have a good idea of where they're going next year. Some were lucky enough to have gotten into their dream schools, others were accepted by a slew of equally amazing colleges (though perhaps not their first choice), and a few were rejected to all but a handful of great schools. We should all 'be happy', our friends, family, and counselors tell us; the hardest part of senior year is over and now remains the <i>best</i> months of high school. But 'great' is a very subjective word and some people are inevitably disappointed. I'm not discounting any of the students who got into their top choices: I believe that they're all deserve it 100%, but I'm sad that my top choices don't feel the same about me.<p>Yes, I did get into a couple of great schools, and I am truly honored and grateful to be accepted by them. But at the same time, I am utterly heartbroken that after years of pushing myself to excel academically and pouring my heart into the application essays, the response is still: 'Dear [x], I am very sorry to let you know that we are unable to offer you admission to [x]'. And I feel so, so guilty for feeling like this, as if I'm jilting my accepted schools and betraying my friends who try to cheer me up.<p>There's also regret. Maybe I should've written about different topics, maybe I should've applied to more schools, maybe I should've gotten more/other recommendations. And while it's very appealing to just blame the system for my failures (ahem <i>College Confidential</i>), I know that it's really no one's fault but my own. So there's an unhealthy amount of anger, bitterness, and disappointment directed at myself right now. Summed together, all of this is strangely numbing and emotionally exhausting.<p>But there is always some hope, even if we do have to trudge through this unpleasantness. It's quite honestly pointless to continue feeling this bad. Rejection and failure is a part of life, and even though my lifelong dreams were crushed over the course of two days, I have to accept that and find new ones. I know that I will eventually be happy and successful at a school that accepts me, despite all the inevitable sad laughter in the coming days.<p>Now I just need to believe that.",1364612130

Forging connections between pairs of strangers where they will fall in love,<p>2. under conditions of oppressive patriarchy.<p>Number 1 is a pretty easy numbers game. for each person, a subset of people match them algorithmically. Another subset will be good matches. If your algorithm doesn't suck, some of the first set overlaps the second.<p>Number 2 is the problem. If you are asking why women are being swamped with textual street harassment such that the noise quite drowns the signal, why women need pseudonymity and ignorable messaging and no-appeal blocklists, why women get shamed for taking an active role in seeking a date (such as OKC) and don't want to admit it, why Mills & Boon nonsense holds so much cultural sway, and why social proof is the most effective way to get dates, the answer to all of the above is patriarchy. Rapey, commoditizing attitudes to sex are patriarchy. Passive, romance-movie, pedestal-putting, shaming, antisexual attitudes to love are patriarchy.",1364612089

The mice are custom bred, genetically modified, and have specifically tuned immune systems. They cost tens of thousands of dollars each (this is not a joke). Since mice reproduce so quickly (and is so profitable), these things can be basically custom ordered to exactly your specifications - with statistically insignificant genetic differences between each one. They come with paperwork showing their exact genetic details, they are RFID tagged in some cases, and they are tested repeatedly before being used in studies - genetically and otherwise.<p>Regarding environment, these animals are kept in extremely controlled conditions. Forced airflow is repeatedly filtered and tested; the water comes from highly filtered sources into each cage. Animal food and bedding is irradiated to kill any microbes, and is generally highly regulated. Each animal room contains multiple ""sentinel"" animals, which are exposed to the same environment as the test subjects (and controls) but are tested to make sure that environmental factors don't impact the study.<p>Additionally, each mouse cage (about the size of a shoebox) holds 5 adult mice; racks of these cages connected to water/air contain ~144 cages. A study with only 6 mice is highly unlikely (although not impossible). With such a large number of animals per square foot, and such a high concentration of grad students, studies are repeated ad nauseam - more so than is ever publicized (mistakes do get made).<p>Again, not to say that your view of this little ""experiment"" with tape is invalid, but animal studies (especially mice) are way more controlled than you could ever imagine.",1364610055

Because the Greeks have it perfectly. They're basically paying fees for students to put together their social life for them. So actually, I just caught myself here: college students might be a good starting point, but Greeks are the absolute worst starting point. They don't need what we're building.

(Of course, this absolute certainty is not attainable, so any sufficiently surprising result should lead you to think that something went wrong.)  Assuming common priors on the other hand, seems unreasonable, unless we're only talking about ""fully uninformed"" priors such as those based on Kolmogorov complexity.<p>Yes, I would say you're half right.  The example of the temperature given by the Wikipedia is really good. The ""degree of coldness"" <i>is</i> a worthy notion.  What bothers me is that fuzzy logicians don't seem to run probability distributions over those degrees of truths.  I mean, I can surely make up a probability distribution on the outside temperature for tomorrow at 10AM.  Assuming that temperature maps to degrees of truth to the sentence ""it's cold"" (say, 100% true below 10C, 0% true beyond 20C, and a linear interpolation in between), then I naturally come up with a probability distribution over the degrees of truth (I should get a Dirac spike at both extremities).<p>Your last one is exactly right.  I'm only  16% from empty to 75% full (excluded).  That's the punishment I get for not producing a theory of the fullness of the bottle which describes my actual beliefs about it.<p>I assume that your ultimate goal in life is to make decisions, or to create a machine that will take decisions.  To make sound decisions, you need to asses their consequences.  Take the example of the bottle: I need a full bottle of water to hike today.  Let's assume for the sake of the argument that it is either empty, or full.  If it's empty, I need to re-fill it, or I would faint from the thirst (not good).  If it's full, checking is only a nuisance (not good either).  Now the question is, how can I minimize my discomfort, on average?<p>Well I need two things: first, a probability distribution.  Let's say I'm pretty sure I filled the bottle yesterday, let's call it a 90% chance.  Second, a utility function.  Baseline, the bottle is full, <i>and</i> I did not bother checking it, utility zero.  Checking costs me 1 utility point, and fainting from thirst costs me 50 points (let's assume my brain is actually capable of performing those utility assessments).  <i>Should</i> I check the bottle?<p>Oh yes.  Not checking means a 10% chance of losing 50 points, or 5 on average.  Checking means a certainty of losing only one point, which costs much less.  Conclusion: check your water supply before you go hiking.  And re-check just to be sure.<p>Now this problem didn't call for fuzzy logic.  We can however come up with a full probability distribution over the quantity of water in the bottle instead of just two possibilities.  From then, fuzzy logic should be able to naturally step in.  But frankly, I prefer to run a a separate (dis)utility function over the state of thirst that the lack of water will provoke (from light thirst to actually faint), and combine it with my probability distribution to make my decision.  (Though at that point, I'd rather just check than frying my brain trying to solve this cost-benefit calculation.)",1364609371

Now you know the statistics, you can go about exerting effort to end up in the 40% that don't drop out. And that number - 60% to 40% - tells you a little bit about how much effort you're going to need to put in (not much).<p>90% of startups fail[1] - now you know that, you want to put yourself in the 10% that don't. 90% to 10% is a bigger gap to jump than 60 to 40, so it's going to be a lot harder.<p>0,1: not actual statistics",1364608878

Which means there's less of a business model in catering to gays and lesbians there (doubly true given that they're rare.)<p>And yes, in theory, straight people can date bi people, but again, by not perfectly serving that bi market you cut off a tiny fraction of your clientele.  Screw up the straight market and your site is doomed.  Which should he focus on?<p>> What I did say was that the way the site felt it felt like it was designed with a pretty narrow frame of how dating worked<p>Yes, that's called ""targeting a particular market.""",1364608817

There's almost always a chance to keep a door open to future prospects, upon failure, thus gaining an ever growing list of contacts and resources.  This is part of ""follow up"".  Unless the entrepreneur is dead or in jail, the door can be open.  <p>",1175810283

9408,comment,9243,9301,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Yes, and at the end of the day a decision has to be made.<p>This is where companies get in trouble- the founders have different opinions.  I've seen two companies struggle because founders differed... and I've known one company where the founder knew what was going on and was clearly in charge (which there were some founding employees, there was no question of who made the decisions)... that company succeeded until the VC forced a new CEO who couldn't make a decision to save his life on us....<p>More people to spread out the early work is good.  Multiple founders can be ok.<p>But one needs to be in charge.",1175810034

9406,comment,9361,9371,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Same here. I already left my job a few months ago to work on my project, but my cofounder is still employed at his. We were moving along great and decided to apply for YC the day before the app was due. Why? Well, seriously because it just sounded like fun. We are doing our project regardless, but to be involved in a fun team like what we imagine the YC SFP will be, just sounds like a blast. Sure we'll be working our tails off, but we're doing that now anyways. If we get accepted we'll have the network of the other SFP founders which is priceless. Really, it can be challenging to find other hackers that are fun, not jaded, smart, and humble enough to actively seek feedback and correction. Not that all the SFP founders will necessarily fall into that category, but probably most of them will if Paul and Jessica are vetting them.<p>For more on the money aspect of the decision - see my post on 'Outside Money and Irritable Bowel Syndrome' at <a href=""http://blog.nanobeepers.com"">http://blog.nanobeepers.com</a>",1175809742
9405,comment,9361,9384,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Some of us contribute to yCombinator because we have day jobs and can't work on our startup while on company time.  And yet we have bosses that tell us to hold up because they aren't done with the requirements yet.  Time is fungible; might as well use our bored-time at work on something semi-productive and free up the time at home for working on the startup.<p>Of course, you could argue that if one really wants their startup to succeed, they shouldn't have a day job.  I'd probably even agree with you.  But ""when to quit"" is a complicated question, particularly if you're gaining (or hopefully soon will be getting - damn boss!) valuable experience in addition to cash.",1175809686
9404,comment,9126,9126,0,0,edgeztv,,,"""2. Secure server software ($5000). This does not seem to be an absolute necessity; there are a lot of sites on the web where you can send your credit card number unencrypted, and to date there have been no reports of the numbers being stolen. But catalog companies may <i>believe</i> that a secure link is necessary, and spending this $5000 would give Webgen a much more professional look.""<p>When you feel like you've missed the gravy train for web startups, quotes like this remind you of all the good things about starting one in 2007.",1175809464
9403,comment,9361,9361,0,0,pg,,,"If YC is for losers, then Robert and Trevor and I are losers ourselves, because we modelled it on how we started Viaweb.  We took $10k in seed funding from our friend Julian, who (since he was a lawyer) also set us up as a company.  <p>For us, Julian's help was both a necessary and sufficient condition of getting launched.  Nothing has changed since then about life in the seed stage.  Sure, maybe you can get to the next stage on $200k instead of a $2m series A round like in the Bubble, but initially you still need at least a few months' living expenses.<p>I only skimmed that [what should I call it? article?], but I did notice one other thing that's mistaken.  We don't judge people by their karma on news.yc, but by the quality of their comments and submissions.  Surely that is a reasonable test.",1175809216
9402,comment,9361,9399,0,0,dfranke,,,"YC's money isn't the most important thing they offer, but in my case (I'm finishing undergrad this month) it probably does make the difference between being able to go full-time right away versus needing to either spend a year saving or moonlight it.",1175808830
9401,comment,9171,9354,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Right, but it's usually possible to find another, simpler idea - even if it's just consulting - that will generate $15k and bring you in contact with potential cofounders or customers.",1175808824

9399,comment,9361,9361,0,0,zkinion,,,"Some of the stuff he says isn't so bad.  It's good to just go out and create something.  Too many people do seem to rely on YC.<p>\nHowever, the money YC gives is really insignificant.  I doubt many people even applied for the money at all.  Its really more about the network and mesh of people you get with it.  Anybody can work and save up 6k, its not that hard.  <p>I didn't apply because I want to be in the San Fran. network isntead of the cambridge area.  If this round was in the bay area, then I would have applied, and been accepted :).<p><p>\n",1175808496

Just living in the Cambridge area for the summer will eat up a chunk of money. If you have a great idea and must have 3 months to concentrate on it or you'll never get it done, just move in with the folks for 3 months.<p>I think most people are applying for the mentoring and collaborative environment.I found a great partner in the process.

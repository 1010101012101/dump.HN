832126,comment,829000,829967,0,0,pyre,,,"Sounds like the people on the beautification project had a lot of inbreeding of ideas. Crap like that just seems a way to justify a decision. I mean how many people <i>actually</i> tripped on those tree wells or on acorns on the ground? How much money is it costing to tear down those old trees and replace them with new ones?<p>This is just a small number of people trying to force their idea of what will look good onto the larger community. Bringing in things like 'tripping hazard' and 'the seeds are more pedestrian friendly' are just way to try and justify their actions/views against people that are outside of their group. It sounds good and all about wanting the trees to be a uniform height, but I suspect that decision was made partially because they expected there to be public outcry. They just wanted to tear down the trees without giving people a chance to rally against the action. Now people are stuck with the decision whether they like it or not.",1253379559

It has many advantages and speaking of disdvantages, most of the ones you specify are really non-issues.<p>I mean, you're not forced to use the newest version of the interpreter. You're not forced to use the newest version of any library. Moreover, you're not forced to use a single specific version of the interpreter on a machine. And with the use of virtualenv or buildout, you won't complain that your application used to work, and it doesn't, because the environment evolved.<p>And if you're ""scpying directories"" between servers, relying on whatever version of the interpreter you find, you're doing it wrong.",1253379423

832110,comment,831817,832053,0,0,moe,,,"It's not actually about breaking functionality. Both java and python go through a long deprecation period before removing language features. Most Python 2.4 code will run on 2.6 just fine, a few warnings nonwithstanding. Just like most Jdk1.3 code will run on 1.6, again with a bunch of deprecation warnings.<p>The bigger problem with willy-nilly upgrades is that the new version is not the version you tested on. It might introduce new bugs, unwillingly. I have seen many more subtile problems with <i>minor version</i> jdk updates (e.g. changes in GC behaviour or outright segfaults) than with any python upgrade so far.<p>The gist is that when you upgrade your environment then you'll just naturally also update the codebase to match it anyways. Or do you upgrade your jdk1.3 project to jdk1.6 and then just ignore the 20 screens of warnings scrolling down on each build?<p>You don't. You either just stick with what works (for finished projects) or port it forward (for ongoing projects).",1253378313
832109,comment,831906,831906,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"That's a terrible analogy. Good analogies should provide an honest insight into a complex situation using a simple imaginary construction. In this case, there's no reason to assume that anyone's objection to founding a startup has anything to do with short-term versus long-term goals, and even if there was, the analogy of the ""hill problem"" doesn't address that objection at all.<p>I think it's much more reasonable to guess that this guy's reluctance to do the startup dance is the result of more complex considerations. His current job is safe; not glamorous, sure, but safe. He's probably making good money, and even if he doesn't really enjoy it, he's just found out that other people actually <i>want</i> him. That can be a powerful motivator by itself.<p>The startup thing is risky. Talking about it is all well and good, and we can make startups sound really sexy because they're what <i>we</i> prefer or need to do, but that doesn't mean that they're really for everyone. People might like the idea of startups, but when it comes to the actual risk, guesswork, and extreme hard work associated with them -- not so much.<p>I mean, hell, I'm working on my second one now, and I couldn't imagine working for anyone else ever again (or sitting in a cubicle). On the other hand, there are definitely days that I would love to not have to worry about whether or not I'll find enough business to pay the rent a couple of months from now. I haven't had a real get-away vacation in I-don't-know-how-long, and my average work day is probably around 11 hours long. I honestly don't know how my girlfriend puts up with it. And, I'm constantly thinking about one business or the other; it's not like I can just ""punch out"" at 5 or 6 o'clock each day and not think about work until the next morning.<p>So, yeah.

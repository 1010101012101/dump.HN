2658492,comment,2657745,2657745,26,0,cturner,,,"The article makes a strong case against ActiveRecord, not against Object Relational Mapping.<p>Under the heading ""The problem with ORM"" the author writes,<p><pre><code>    The most obvious problem with ORM as an abstraction is
    that it does not adequately abstract away the implementation
    details. The documentation of all the major ORM libraries is
    rife with references to SQL concepts. Some introduce them
    without indicating their equivalents in SQL, while others
    treat the library as merely a set of procedural functions for
    generating SQL. 
</code></pre>
This is true of ActiveRecord, it's untrue of object graph ORMs like Apache Cayenne.<p>I find two patterns to be key to effective ORM:<p>* Data Access Objects. This is for when you have nothing, and want to get an entrypoint into the schema. In this case, you should be able to write near-pure SQL to get what you want.<p>* Entity Objects. This is what the DAO will give you back - either an individual or a list. Each instance represents a row in a table, and has methods that will do lookups to foreign keys. Once you have this, you have an entrypoint into the data graph, and can use foreign keys to crawl around to wherever you need to go.<p>The DAO layer is a simple, centralised place where you can implement permissioning logic.<p>If you need to do something high-performance (usually some sort of report), you create a custom DAO, and have it return custom entities (instances of classes that don't have 1 to 1 association with a table) that fit your need.<p>I've found that after a certain point of complexity in an application, it becomes impractical not to use an ORM. It's like working in a type-unsafe language. You refactor something, and SQL-in-code breaks all over the place. That path leads to the hiring of dedicated DBAs, and abstraction of the schema behind stateless layers of PL/SQL in a doomed attempt to get to grips with the complexity of the problem space.<p>I worked on a system with a very tough customer where they repeatedly demanded major schema changes that were sitting in front of a business logic layer and frontend that had already been written. While the project had lots of problems, those particular refactorings were very straightforward. I was able to modify the ORM, and then just fix complilation problems and a few obvious tentacles from them until the application recompiled, at which point it worked again.<p>Some more criticism:<p><pre><code>    This leads naturally to another problem of ORM:
    inefficiency. When you fetch an object, which of its
    properties (columns in the table) do you need? ORM can't
    know, so it gets all of them (or it requires you to say,
    breaking the abstraction).
</code></pre>
I'm rusty but remember that at least in WebObjects EOF at least you can nominate what you want to retrieve, including automatic joins to retrieve stuff over foreign key jumps<p>The author's first suggested alternative ""Use objects"" offers worse technical debt than ActiveRecord. I anticipate there are a lot of shitty systems being on top of key-value stores. You can get fast results doing it, but it has technical debt and doesn't scale horizontally. The key-value store is becoming the next generation equivalent of ""Oh we'll just build it in excel, and worry about the consequences later on"". But depends what you're doing. There are situations where foreign keys are good.<p>The second alternative is ""Use SQL in the Model"" The advice of the heading doesn't match the content of the text that follows. I think the author means to recommend building a service that wraps the model by answering questions. If not, that's the point I think that should be made.<p>It's common for companies to create a database, and then have many entrypoints into it. This is a mistake and creates technical debt. As soon as you have multiple entrypoints like this, you lose ability to refactor your schema (because it's impractical to get multiple stakeholders to make concurrent changes) and your system rots.<p>Instead, you create a model service that wraps the schema, but also has stateful knowledge. For example - it knows the permissions of the user who is talking to it and can tailor its response based on their permissions. Then you return results in a transport format. I can't recommend a good, mainstream mechanism for this. JSON, YAML are fiddly because they're typed, XML is  unnecessarily verbose<p>Anyway - there's no reason not to use a good ORM in this business logic layer. For small systems - sure - use SQL in the model. For the larger stuff, you have a more maintainable system if you use an ORM. But if it's a complicated space, steer towards Cayenne or Hibernate, rather than active record patterns.",1308163594

2658443,comment,2657745,2657745,52,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"This seems incredibly naive.<p>ORMs reduce code duplication. They speed up development, especially when you're treating the underlying data storage as a ""dumb"" datastore that could just as easily be sqlite or H2 as MySQL or Postgres.<p>As for ORMs having some sort of negative impact on the queries sent to the underlying database - it really depends on what ORM you use but any ORM I've used had support for pre-loading relationships in advance when required, removing that N+1 problem.<p>I also want to add that I wrote an ORM for the first company I worked for and when it was finished it was a drop-in replacement for 90% of the queries in our application - and I mean that literally the SQL generated by the ORM was exactly the same as the SQL being replaced. The queries that it couldn't replace (mainly reporting queries) <i>already had an aggressively tuned caching layer in front of them anyway because they were so hairy</i>.<p>But the real point is this: the performance of the ORM didn't really matter because we were a database driven website that needed to scale - so we had layers upon layers of caching to deal with that issue.<p>And that is an extremely important point - the way ORMs generalise a lot of queries (every query for an object is always the same no matter what columns you really need) lends itself to extremely good cache performance. Take the query cache of MySQL for example - it stores result sets in a sort of LRU. If you make n queries for the same row in a DB but select different columns each time - you store the same ""entity"" n times in the query cache. Depending on how big n is, that can cause much worse cache hit performance than simply storing one representation of that entity and letting all n use cases use the attributes they need.<p>Now, relying on MySQL's query cache for anything would not be smart, but replace it with memcached or reddis or whatever memory-is-a-premium cache and the same point stands. 
Another example to drive the point home is a result set where you join the result entities to the user query so that you can get all the results back in a single query. In theory this is a great way to reduce the number of queries sent to your DB but if you have caching then there are many times where you could have very low cache hit ratios for user queries since they tend to be unique (for example they use user id) but where you could still get great cache hit performance if certain entities appear often across all those result sets by leaving out the join and doing N+1 fetches instead.<p>ORMs prevent you from scaling as much as using Python or Ruby over C does.<p>So I guess that leaves the point about leaky or broken abstractions. Well I would never claim that you can abstract across a whole bunch of databases anyway, I think that's a ridiculous claim that most ORMs make. These types of abstractions when people try to hide the underlying technology are really just a lowest-common-denominator of all the feature sets. So if you chose some technology because you really wanted a differentiating feature then most likely you will find yourself working against such abstractions. Interestingly enough, the dire support for cross-database queries which are perfectly legal in MySQL but not in other vendors is the reason I had to roll my own ORM. But the productivity and maintainability benefits were well worth it.<p>So yeah I guess what I'm saying is: premature optimization is the root of all evil, there are no silver bullets and performance and scalability is about measuring and optimising where needed. And finally: ORMs are not an anti-pattern.",1308162886

I would never<p>Incorrect abstraction - I actually agree with this point, but this does not really seem to reflect on ORMs. This point has much more to do with the ongoing debate between the NoSQL movement and relational databases.<p>Death by a thousand queries - I hardly think that this is a knock against all ORMs. Different ORMs have different solutions (or a lack thereof) to this problem. I use Django a lot, and Django's built-in ORM offers a lot of ""frills"" that can help to protect against this (lazy loading, selective loading of columns, selected loading of related models). I know that, in the Ruby world, Datamapper seems to have some ways of dealing with this problem as well. It really isn't as simple as saying all ORMs do this therefore all ORMs are bad.

Also it could be found that when you aren't being talked to, that there is something wrong with yourself, instead of it being the other person's issue. So perhaps it causes some issues that way too. I think society is sort of conditioned to think someone who doesn't socialize at a certain level, somehow has a problem. Which we are a society, socializing keeps us together, so its understood why this is probably seen as a bit more of an issue. Being introverted I like to maintain a low level of socializing, I do it when I want to, I have no problem doing it, its just not as much as other people. But not all people have that ability, and I think people assume the worst, that the person somehow needs ""fixing"" and isn't happy with their social life and doesn't know how to socialize. Where me, bottom line, I'm not talking to you cause I don't want to. Whether its because I find the person terribly annoying, or just can't think of anything worth while to say is dependent on the situation.

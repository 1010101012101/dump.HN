8786447,story,,,4,9,automator,"Ask HN: Automating large Enterprise business operations",,"Hi HN.\nI&#x27;d like some advice about automating business operations - what to consider, what technologies or framework to look out for etc. For background, I&#x27;m working for an ICT service provider, and just got promoted to look into enterprise-wide automation and system. My team is small, but I report directly to the C-level. Frankly, I&#x27;m a hobbyist programmer, and was only promoted to this post due to my enthusiasm and small track records i.e. handling CSV files for analysis etc.<p>The ultimate goals are to improve lead time in service delivery, reduce aging tickets, and reduce cost. I currently see gap in performance management, where the bosses do not have clear visibility or simply do not trust the performance metrics.<p>Simultaneously, there are lean internal consultants doing studies and making recommendations. Also, middle managers are being trained in Six Sigma, acquiring &quot;belts&quot;.<p>To reiterate, how do I start assessing the situation and what kind of technologies or methodologies associated with this scenario? Is it SOA, workflow engine, ERP etc? How feasible is using standard web framework i.e. Django or Flask for business automation?<p>Thanks.",1419299851

Whenever individuals must make decisions on behalf of organizations (public or private), they must be able to justify their actions in the rational, sometimes psychopathic, terms of their institution (to make <i>legible</i> decisions, to use Venkatesh Rao&#x27;s terminology).<p>Though economics is value-neutral when it comes to what individuals define as their best interests, institutions have their best interests defined quite explicitly, and are often indifferent to any other outcome. Applying the rational actor model to such institutions provides a great deal of cover, if not active encouragement, for maximizing the acquisition of power and resources with little regard for the irrational human processes of morality, responsibility and decency.",1419299785

And worse, they are specifically <i>political</i> appointments, not an attempt at appointing a quasi-independent &quot;body of experts&quot;. There was a move some decades ago to change the makeup so the committee would be comprised of independent experts, from e.g. the academic, NGO, or scientific sectors, and maybe even including non-Norwegians.

You will never seriously consider this level of evidence &quot;good&quot; if something important to you depended on it.<p>Second, and much more importantly: even pretending those studies were conducted on a billion people and showed a 5x difference (or whatever it is among SV entrepreneurs), all it means is that this is how people behave <i>now</i>.<p>Sociology doesn&#x27;t purport to be physics, and those aren&#x27;t laws of nature. I mean, you could have done literacy studies in the 1800s and shown that blacks are illiterate (with much more statistical rigor, BTW); what does that mean?

8786423,comment,8785951,8785951,0,0,JacobHarrington,,,"Fascinating read, and it touches upon a problem that seems to exist in every programming organization: you can&#x27;t say why, but you just <i>know</i> who the best developers are. Sure, that statement is somewhat trivial when experience and ability vary wildly, but when the skill levels begin to converge there is a lot more self-organization among the developers such that they somewhat rank themselves.<p>To me the problem comes when looking for new developers to add to the organization. In the thirst to determine what a &quot;good&quot; developer is we&#x27;ve instead settled on choosing those who seem to have studied the hardest while learning how to program. The fact that this knowledge is rarely directly applied in most tech orgs (how many basic CRUD apps are hurt by poor algorithm choices, after all?), but is still the only thing approaching a reliable barometer of basic competence is a pain point for any programmer hunting for a job.<p>Programming is a creative endeavor in many ways, which means subjectivity is involved in the selection of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot;. Figuring out how to codify that into an objective ranking is something that, when solved, will take the computing job market by storm. Or then again, that could just be wishful thinking on my part.",1419299394

Even this much support for code generation isn&#x27;t strictly necessary.<p>The article only gives one reason why generated code should be checked in (&quot;if only for the reason that the program it invokes might not be available on the target machine&quot;) but I suspect there might be other unstated reasons: it&#x27;s useful to have a permanent record of generated code in source control for auditing and debugging, and it ensures that package authors can&#x27;t make downstream builds slower by choosing a slow build tool.<p>In the open source world, your dependencies are maintained by people in other organizations.

My impression is that the pain point they&#x27;re addressing is, you want to build some awesome email integration app and sell it to companies, but you&#x27;re looking at how complicated it would be to speak IMAP and IMAP-with-quirks and ActiveSync and the Gmail API and everything else (in order to build a high-quality integration) and that&#x27;s scaring you. You can outsource that problem to Inbox, they&#x27;ll make sure they get good-quality data from any email server reliably, and you just speak an HTTP API. This involves deploying a separate server which caches email. You talk to the &quot;sync engine&quot; over a reasonable protocol, and the sync engine takes care of talking an unreasonable protocol to wherever the data actually lives.<p>JMAP is an API to directly access an email store. It&#x27;s something that an email provider (Fastmail, most obviously) will directly support, but it also only helps you for those providers that actually speak JMAP.<p>If you&#x27;re an email server developer, an ISP, etc., then JMAP is cool and Inbox is not really useful -- there&#x27;s not much of a point in having an email server that speaks IMAP and then also sticking a frontend to convert IMAP to something else. You might as well just make your email server speak a reasonable protocol directly.<p>If you&#x27;re an app author, Inbox is useful today, and JMAP is only useful, maybe, if all your users are Fastmail users.<p>If you&#x27;re an in-house developer at a large company that&#x27;s running Exchange, and realistically you have no hope of getting the email admins to switch email servers (and you wouldn&#x27;t want to run the email service yourself, even if they offered), JMAP is useless to you, and Inbox is super compelling.<p>(There is probably an argument that the Inbox &quot;sync engine&quot; should speak JMAP on the front end / those APIs should converge.

Assuming the von Neumann machines are small and are being powered by an energy source (i.e lasers) from their origin star system they will spread through the galaxy at close to the speed of light. This spread method creates an interesting effect in that we would not see the stars go out until the von Neumann machines had almost reached us if the origin star was within our galaxy - basically the von Neumann machines would be traveling only a little behind the light front from the origin star system (this would make a good science fiction story).<p>If the origin star system was far enough a way, then the slightly slower speed that the von Neumann machines would travel at should allow us to see them progressing though a distance galaxy.

Digesting a message ABCD, crc(ABCD), is simply the expression crc(crc(crc(crc(A) + B) + C) + D).  To parallelize, this can be rearranged (via distributivity of CRC of XOR) as crc(crc(crc(crc(A) + B))) + crc(crc(C) + D).  This is simply the CRC of the second half, XORed with the CRC of the first half passed through the function crc(crc(_)) (crc^2), which is itself linear and can be precomputed just like CRC is.<p>This extends to arbitrary block sizes and/or arbitrary strides through the message.  So e.g. you can have four threads compute the CRCs of separate 64-byte (cache-line-sized) blocks within 256-byte chunks, separating each block within a thread using crc^192, offset the results as appropriate with crc^64^k, and then combine them with XOR.<p>(Protip: these fun properties are exactly what make CRCs a TERRIBLE choice for cryptography!)",1419297529

As a consequence, the term becomes vacuous, because whatever any human does at any point in time, well, it must have been because she or he had some unobservable notion of utility that was maximized by whatever they happened to be doing at the time. So you end up with a &quot;scientific theory&quot; that does not actually allow you to make any predictions, which makes it totally worthless.<p>Furthermore, facts that seemingly contradict utility-maximization are easily argued away: For example, the fact that humans&#x27; behaviour does not appear consistent over time is explained by utility functions change over time.[1]<p>Once you accept the notion of utility based on this technically unassailable approach to it, however, people have a tendency to subtly shift what they mean by utility, sneaking a hidden value judgement into their argument that might be hard to catch (of course, that value judgement always tends to boil down to: the utility that should be maximized is somewhat equivalent to monetary value). [2]<p>Yes, there may be a small number of genuinely well-meaning academic economists who do this. However, public discourse has very few well-meaning economists[3], and even fewer academic ones. Given the difficulties of the term, it would be a pragmatic move to eliminate it.<p>Frankly, I think the main reason that eliminating the notion of utility is so difficult is that eliminating that term leaves a vacuum that is difficult to fill. Explaining human nature is an extremely tough problem, which we are basically unable to solve today. Rather than acknowledge that they are unable to do it, economists worship their variant of the &quot;god of the gaps&quot;.<p>[1] Actually, this is very reminiscent of discussions with people who believe in the existence of a god. Whatever fact one points out that either contradicts or does not fit the existing (non-)evidence well, believers just tend to retreat to a technically unassailable definition of god that ends up making the statement &quot;god exists&quot; pretty vacuous.<p>[2] Again, this is very reminiscent of discussions with people who believe in the existence of a god. Once one concedes that yes, a god whose existence is so vacuous might well exist, they will at some point switch their definition of god back to one which implies that their god can affect the physical world.<p>[3] The problem is similar to regulatory capture, an idea expressed here: <a href=""http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.de/2014/11/has-big-business-captured-economics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.de/2014/11/has-big-business...</a>",1419297074

Smith&#x27;s &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot; is not a theoretical exercise in a moral and emotional vacuum, but an explanation of how development and prosperity come to be in the real world.[1] There are some examples laid out by classical economists which make the assumptions that you describe, but those assumptions were not key tenets of the classical school.  Men like Ricardo and Bastiat spent their time addressing the real world, with all its corn laws, broken windows, and import tariffs; instead of the physicist&#x27;s &quot;friction-less vacuum&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations</a>",1419296907

At the top of their Wikipedia entry[0], it says that JPMorgan Chase has roughly 2.5 TRILLION in assets. According to this[1] site, 1.29 TRILLION in customer deposits. Hackers believed to be from Russia breached some of their systems and stole... drumroll please... customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. There&#x27;s stuff in there of value comparable to national economies, a mind-boggling amount of money, and they didn&#x27;t get a penny of it. All they got was a glorified phone book.<p>Apple can&#x27;t seem to protect their Apple IDs or iCloud data from determined attackers. Amazon and GoDaddy have given over total control of user&#x27;s accounts to pretty simple social engineering attacks, both giving the attackers the keys to the castle. None of these attackers seem to have much in the way of funding or organization, and the stolen data doesn&#x27;t seem to monetize terribly well. Do you think these companies would be able to keep trillions of dollars of their customers&#x27; money safe from attackers? Chase seems to be able to. Maybe the tech companies should take a few lessons from them.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/JPMorgan_Chase#/Financial_data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikiwand.com/en/JPMorgan_Chase#/Financial_data</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/jpm/financials/balance-sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/jpm/financials/ba...</a>",1419296889

Perhaps, and it would be &quot;flag with a reason&quot;, in other words, choose from a list of common reasons why something should be flagged (like reporting posts on Facebook and other social networks). Anything flagged sufficiently would be investigated; until an admin determines that a post is abuse, it might remain (cannot decide clearly about this). Excessive false flagging would result in the flagger being dinged on karma. And losing the ability to flag. (Another would be to allow one flag per 100 karma points or some such thing.) We know from behavioural psychology that punishment rarely works, that rewarding desirable behaviour is far more effective. Why do we, a supposedly intelligent crowd guided by facts and well established science, behave like schoolyard bullies, shouting down the voices of others?<p>I upvote anything that piques my interest, intrigues me, expresses well what I thought myself, expresses well a thought completely counter to mine (which often means it is the first two things listed as well), and I often upvote downvoted items; the first paragraph implies why.",1419296831

Sure you might not get wet but damn I would not want to be that close to the road in the dead of summer and I cannot imagine the fun on cold days either. Top it off with no real crash protection; just versus normal objects; most likely very little standards in manufacturing, and then there is visibility; both for the user and others. Storage, well as long as it fits on a bicycle it should fit here, maybe.<p>So yeah, its more efficient than an automobile but it does not compete with automobiles. Why compare not compare it to something in everyday use, like bicycles? Price most likely. So they went with an absurd comparison.",1365760748

It would be theoretically possible to create a ghost, give it a speed and heading to make people avoid it.  But I'm not sure what it would achieve.  Maybe I'm not being creative enough.<p>Thing is though, why would that be any different to ""FY holding London NDB UFY 60 descending 40."" on the radio.  If you then dropped off the radio completely a massive poostorm would happen as ATC tried to figure out who that transmission came from.  Whilst ATC have to try and find the plane that thinks it's got full service in class-a space (non pilots this is the busy bits of sky where you have to get permission from guys on the ground) they would divert away from that area.<p>I'm not aware of a TCAS system which doesn't alert the pilot to the fact it is changing the autopilot heading.  If this happened in busy controlled airspace, it would have to be with acknowledgement from ATC or the pilot would at worse do a near miss to avoid a phantom that wasn't there, he certainly wouldn't hit one that was to avoid a ghost which ground wasn't warning him of.<p>If you're over the north atlantic and the TCAS wants to change heading or attitude, it will alert the meatbag AFAIK.",1365760518

He will reject anything that goes against his rose-tinted view of Google. Reason and logic won't reach him, and that's why it's alright to just call him a fanboy and move on, even though that's pointless too, of course.<p>In this case, I just wanted to point out the absurdity of calling iOS a ""complete joke"".<p>> And that'll do nothing to sway the person you're replying to.

Also, I'm not sure people are prepared to mix the problems of cash and electronic transactions just yet, there are some advantages to the banking system we have now, such as the ability to reverse fraudulent transactions.<p>I think the example from fiction, Cryptonomicon, is actually very helpful, because they understood they needed a big honking pile of <i>gold</i> to kick-start the legitimacy of the whole thing, if it's just free floating then it too easily becomes a pyramid scheme and you have people who just do currency exchanges but who never actually use the new currency as money. You want people to hold onto money because it's <i>money</i>, not because they think the money can go up in value, that's precisely what you don't want.<p>Unfortunately, there are now a lot of people in the bitcoin world who do what the exchange rate of bitcoins to go up, because they view bitcoin's as an investment and they still view dollars as ""real money"".

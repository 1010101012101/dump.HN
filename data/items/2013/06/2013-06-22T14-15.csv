But in reality all this time, the population gets more and more frustrated, and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the population revolts.<p>So far the Brazilian politicians have been <i>lucky</i> that all these 1 million people haven&#x27;t become <i>violent</i> and ask for their blood. Because to be honest, I think at least some of the corrupt leaders need to be punished <i>severely</i>, possibly even with the death penalty (like Ceausescu was in Romania).<p>It&#x27;s really the only way they&#x27;ll learn their lesson, and more importantly, future generations of politicians will know now to upset the population to the point where they&#x27;ll revolt and ask for their execution. I&#x27;m not usually pro-death penalty, but if there&#x27;s anyone deserving it, it&#x27;s the oppressive/corrupt leaders that make millions of people suffer through their ruling.<p>I definitely think the leaders <i>intentionally</i> abusing their own Constitution deserve the death penalty, because if they don&#x27;t get that, then it&#x27;s just an invitation for future leaders to abuse it. They swore to protect it and obey it, and there needs to be a way to force them to do just that. Otherwise what&#x27;s the point? Imagine how different things would be in US, if politicians would fear death penalty if they abuse the Constitution, and keep passing unconstitutional laws.<p>I feel almost the same way about bankers who get away with their crimes. How are they supposed to learn their lesson if they aren&#x27;t even threatened by prison time, even though they lost the pensions and deposits of millions of people? If they think they have the potential to earn tens of billions of hundreds of billions from risking the money of those people, they&#x27;ll be much more inclined to do it if they only risk a couple of billion in penalty, and that&#x27;s it.<p>The population is supposed to rectify these sort of abuses by the elite in a society. It&#x27;s up to the population to ultimately decide how much of a punishment these people get, and if their &quot;representatives&quot; aren&#x27;t up for it, then they need to change them, or at least scare them into applying their will.",1371912755

5923663,comment,5917392,5917392,1,0,avalore,,,"As someone who (1) runs a SaaS product for UK letting agents and (2) has hunted for a rented property in the last 12 months I think you&#x27;ve done a nice job but as some others have pointed out I can&#x27;t see why someone who is looking for a property (rent or for sale) would use this over RM/Zoopla.<p>These aren&#x27;t necessarily all applicable/useful to you but some observations/niggles I&#x27;ve had, taking in to account my first two points above, are:<p>- RM charges extortionate fees (I&#x27;m not sure about Zoopla) to agents. They&#x27;re not happy about it, but feel they have no alternative (there&#x27;s a reason for that - chicken and egg). This is from numerous comments made by my customers.<p>- By relying on an API from a major property portal I would be worried - How will you have better data than them? If your USP is UX/ease of use then do you think they would let you get that far before they change their T&C&#x27;s?<p>- Because RM/Zoopla are expensive there are still a huge amount of properties not advertised on these portals. From my own experience, I wanted to go with a private landlord rather than an agent I had to personally visit a huge number of properties that didn&#x27;t fit my requirements (there was no way to tell in advance because they only advertised on classified sites/local paper) - there&#x27;s an opportunity here - make it is for private landlords to easily list their properties AND make sure those listings are of good quality (interior photos not just exterior, etc)<p>- Talking of quality ... Ensure all of your listings are accurate, plenty of photos, floor plans, council tax band, etc. Just forget about low quality listings.<p>- OR, opposite of that, concentrate on properties that aren&#x27;t adequately advertised elsewhere does RM/Zoopla have a property with one low quality photo and a one sentence description? Go out of your way to get that extra information and focus on promoting those properties. When everyone else is looking at RM/Zoopla/etc and seeing the same properties you&#x27;ll have a different inventory set to the rest with more detail.<p>- DONT be like everyone else and focus on the entire housing market in the UK (a few other commenters have said the same). Focus on rented, or for sale, or quality listings, unique listings focus on something you can do better than the rest.<p>- There have been many competitors to RM/Zoopla. Most of them fail because, in my opinion, they can&#x27;t solve the chicken and egg problem (either no visitors or poor quality property data) and end up launching an RM/Zoopla clone with a different UI.<p>None of this is to say it can&#x27;t be done or you&#x27;re doing it the wrong way it can be and I&#x27;d love to see someone succeed, but it won&#x27;t be done just on UI/UX.",1371911033

I mean, it was legal to exterminate Jews in Nazi Germany, send millions to death camps in Soviet Russia and starve 10s of millions to death in Communist China.<p>Strict legality is particularly low bar to pass. What happened to the spirit of the law? What happened to public discussions of the law? What happened to proportional use of the justice system? What happened to basic human rights?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just naive, but when people hide behind the &quot;Well it&#x27;s legal! A secret court said so!&quot; charade, even when they know that that it doesn&#x27;t follow the spirit of the laws that they currently operate under, it just pisses me off.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like when someone cheats a system using a secret loophole that was clearly not intended to be used for that purpose. The person then turns around and says that it&#x27;s a perfectly legitimate move. They then move forward on the assumption that the mere existence of said loophole gives them carte blanche to just do whatever they hell they want to do.<p>It appears as though the NSA has hacked the legal system.",1371911001

It makes videos of fires appear as though the fire is bigger than it would have appeared in person. Keep that in mind while viewing the video. Try it out some time with your cell phone.<p>That the car is completely engulfed isn&#x27;t suspicious. All of the upholstery is flammable. Cars burn quickly once the interior becomes involved because they are usually not starved for fuel (upholstery) or air (windows broken, doors open).<p>The car should be engineered so that there will not be a fuel tank breach in a non-fatal collision. If we assume this is so, we can assume:<p>1. Velocity was high enough to breach the tank with impact. Engine/transmission being ejected can help us find the velocity at impact. It continued to travel some distance indicating a high velocity, as most crashes never have the engine/transmission separate from the vehicle.<p>2. Tank was damaged by the collision with the curb or by collision with the fire hydrant immediately prior to final collision, weakening it, making it more likely for the tank to rupture and spill fuel.<p>3. Vehicle tampering. The car could have been tampered with to make a fire more likely.<p>4. Manufacturing defect. (unlikely)<p>If we assume 1. it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the crash was fatal, just that Hastings was unlucky. Mercedes have lots of safety built in. Hastings was young and fit enough to survive an airbag collision. In any case, this one shouldn&#x27;t be rejected until the final velocity is calculated. Looks plausible to me.<p>Personally I lean towards 2, making Hastings very unlucky. Two means that the final collision caused a catastrophic failure of the tank and probably doused fuel all over the car, which later ignited[1], and moments after that caused a secondary ignition of the upholstery, burning him. I hope he was unconscious.<p>I don&#x27;t like to think about three, even though it isn&#x27;t without precedent. Talking about three is even worse. I&#x27;d say this is least likely, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out. This whole affair smells, and I don&#x27;t like it one bit.<p>[1] The source of ignition was probably the catalytic converter, or an electrical short/spark.",1371910970

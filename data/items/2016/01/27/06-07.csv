10978616,comment,10962320,10970919,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"I seriously doubt anybody gets lax treatment when it comes to meeting the standard requirements of a FAA certification. Regardless of the background of the persons carrying out the certification.<p>With that said, FAA certifications aren&#x27;t completely unbiased and non-Boeing certifications may be subjected to additional scrutiny above and beyond the standards.<p>I used to work in Flight Simulation and specifically worked on a project that had to go through a baseline certification for training readiness.<p>It was an 80s era simulator, produced by a manufacturer other than Boeing, running on older hardware. We installed and updated the system to match the airlines tail number configuration, added new engine models (GE to P&W), updated the visuals to match the current runway configurations, and updated the engine avionics from analog to glass displays. Subject to say, there was a lot riding on our ability to get it certified.<p>After experiencing the process first hand. There&#x27;s definitely some room for subjective bias. They came up with every reason they could think of to fail the system but in the end we met the baseline and then some so it was passed.<p>I think the bigger issue is that Boeing is closely tied to the policymakers so they have carte blanche to pass new standards that fail old-yet-reliable systems. Keep in mind that, unlike the software development world, stability trumps technological advancement. Unless the former directly contributes to the latter in a way that improves safety (ex requiring TCAS). Systems running on 20-30 year old hardware are the norm, not the exception.<p>To make matters worse the FAA regularly releases advisory circulars (ie not standards) that are sometimes leveraged by certifiers as if they are standards. They can&#x27;t really enforce a non-standard but that won&#x27;t stop some from attempting to use them as leverage.<p>A system that fails the first time can still be certified but the process to resubmit will likely delay operations for months. For a Commercial Full Flight Simulator that could add up to $750-$1500/hour, 24 hours/day, 7 days/week in lost revenue. Considering simulators are a &#x27;cheap&#x27; alternative to flying actual aircraft, I could only imagine how much an airline stands to lose if an aircraft were to fail.<p>Boeing is a prime example of a government sanctioned monopoly. It&#x27;s allowed to be so because the company is vital to the US economy, the barrier of entry is too high for a competitor to enter, and Boeing has to compete on the international stage with Airbus. In simulation, the story is the same except instead of Airbus/Boeing it&#x27;s CAE/Alteon (ie Boeing).<p>Many of the new policies introduced are &#x27;safety theatre&#x27; designed to artificially raise the watermark drown the competition.<p>The ironic thing is, Boeing has grown so large they they&#x27;re basically running out of room for growth. Their only option going forward is relocation and/or outsourcing. Both of which they&#x27;ve already started to do.",1453876485

There is no reason that the frontend should be blocked because the API design can be figured out before the backend is written and the frontend can mock out the missing features until they are available.&quot;<p>Came here to say exactly this. At my current workplace, one of the very first steps in any project that involves both FE and BE work is for FE and BE engineers to get together and design the API. Once that&#x27;s done, work can proceed on both sides in a largely asynchronous and independent manner. And one of the first things to be implemented on the BE is API endpoints with multiple mocks that can be requested by the FE, so the FE can start integrating with the endpoints as early as possible.",1453876137

A poet produces poems and sells a book of poems. We assume that the poet has created wealth out of thin air and that wealth is therefore not a zero sum game.<p>But in order to produce the poem, the poet needs energy. Energy for sustenance, comes to all humans in the form of food. Food is either meat or vegetables. Meat comes from animals that usually eat vegetables. Vegetables gain their energy from the sun. The wealth (poems included) that humans produce is limited by the energy we extract from the sun and material we can extract from the earth. All abstraction comes from physical primitives which are limited by physical laws, thus all abstract products such as poems, literature and art are all limited and thus part of a zero sum game.<p>Actually if you follow the energy chain of everything to the root, all things end at the sun (nuclear power is an exception). You could say that the sun is basically an unlimited source of energy... but commerce is directly affected by the rate in which we can extract energy from the sun. Since it is physically impossible to extract energy from the sun at an unlimited rate, the rate must therefore be limited and all commerce, products and abstract ideas that arise from usage of this energy must also be, in turn, limited.",1453876123

Here&#x27;s a call for it from 1905:<p><i>&quot;The time is comm&#x27; and though I&#x27;m no youngster, I may see it, when New York City will break away from the State and become a state itself. It&#x27;s got to come. The feelin&#x27; between this city and the hayseeds that make a livin&#x27; by plunderin&#x27; it is every bit as bitter as the feelin&#x27; between the North and South before the war. And, let me tell you, if there ain&#x27;t a peaceful separation before long, we may have the horrors of civil war right here in New York State. Why, I know a lot of men in my district who would like nothin&#x27; better today than to go out gunnin&#x27; for hayseeds!</i><p><i>New York City has got a bigger population than most of the states in the Union. It&#x27;s got more wealth than any dozen of them. Yet the people here, as I explained before, are nothin&#x27; but slaves of the Albany gang. We have stood the slavery a long, long time, but the uprisin&#x27; is near at hand. It will be a fight for liberty, just like the American Revolution. We&#x27;ll get liberty peacefully if we can; by cruel war if we must.</i><p><i>Just think how lovely things would be here if we had a Tammany Governor and Legislature meetin&#x27;, say in the neighborhood of Fifty-ninth Street, and a Tammany Mayor and Board of Aldermen doin&#x27; business in City Hall! How sweet and peaceful everything would go on!</i><p><i>The people wouldn&#x27;t have to bother about nothin&#x27;. Tammany would take care of everything for them in its nice quiet way. You wouldn&#x27;t hear of any conflicts between the state and city authorities. They would settle everything pleasant and comfortable at Tammany Hall, and every bill introduced in the Legislature by Tammany would be sure to go through. The Republicans wouldn&#x27;t count.</i><p><i>Imagine how the city would be built up in a short time! At present we can&#x27;t make a public improvement of any consequence without goin&#x27; to Albany for permission, and most of the time we get turned down when we go there. But, with a Tammany Governor and Legislature up at Fifty-ninth Street, how public works would hum here! The Mayor and Aldermen could decide on an improvement, telephone the Capitol, have a bill put through in a jiffy and—there you are. We could have a state constitution, too, which would extend the debt limit so that we could issue a whole lot more bonds. As things are now, all the money spent for docks, for instance, is charged against the city in calculatin&#x27; the debt limit, although the Dock Department provides immense revenues. It&#x27;s the same with some other departments. This humbug would be dropped if Tammany ruled at the Capitol and the City Hall, and the city would have money to burn.&quot;</i> -- George Washington Plunkett [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2810/2810-h/2810-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2810/2810-h/2810-h.htm</a>",1453875653

10978533,comment,10974870,10978314,0,0,brimworks,,,"1) All features/algorithms were ported, and we only added new functionality that never existed in the old Python code base. A few of the features that got added include: dispatching builds, getting live logs, re-encrypt keys, deploy encrypted artifacts, fix many bugs, support running multiple agents on a single computer, etc. I should also mention that we previously had two separate downloads: a CLI used for uploading releases, and the agent used for dispatching deployments. The functionality of both of these code bases where merged into our new Lua based &quot;client&quot; so customers only have to install a single binary that is less than 10MB (the binary size depends on your platform).<p>2) Deployments with the new agent were noticeably faster, (like 1 second deployments that used to take 20+ seconds). However, this speed up was largely due to the Python codes design which had a &quot;continuation&quot; loop which was polling based, but the Lua code used coroutines and simply continued the threads when the steps were complete.<p>Overall, I think the choice to use Lua (or more specifically luvi) was a great decision. Note that it did take a few iterations in order to come up with the optimal way of using Lua + libuv. Originally I was taking the Node.JS approach of using callbacks, but that approach has two problems:<p>[a] It is difficult to properly implement &quot;back pressure&quot; so that all queues between producer and consumer are bounded.<p>[b] It is difficult to handle errors properly.<p>Lua coroutines allowed me to write a simple &quot;green thread&quot; library that encapsulated these challenges.",1453875091

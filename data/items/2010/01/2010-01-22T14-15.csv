Keep in mind that it did not tell me in any obvious way that I needed to take extra steps to activate the account. Once I tried to log in it started asking me questions like ""What is your father's father's name?"" and my answer was: you cannot possibly know that yet since I haven't told you.

1069710,comment,1069357,1069581,0,0,sailormoon,,,"I agree and would like to add a couple more points.<p>I think the notion of privacy is perhaps more of an issue in the Japanese psyche. Perhaps it's a consequence of such a long experience living in such close contact with each other but there are an awful lot of ""unwritten rules"" about what you can and cannot do. Witness the uproar when Google Maps took photographs over people's fences - that is simple ""not done"" in Japan and Google were forced to reshoot a lot of photos. It's the same with personal relationships. They are not supposed to be so visible in Japanese society. The trend for westerners to accumulate as many ""friends"" as possible .. I cannot imagine normal Japanese behaving in such a way. The members of the group are indeed kind of private and unsolicited ""friend requests"" would be looked upon dimly.<p>I know a few Japanese on Facebook but they really are the westernised outliers. Furthermore, Japan also has a rich and highly functional range of services which fulfil all the functions they want - it's not just Mixi. They have their own little ecosystem of web apps, usually optimised for the ubiquitous web-capable mobile phones. Facebook adds little to this equation. Indeed FB's strengths, like public photo sharing, might seem like a negative to the Japanese mind.<p>I don't see it taking off there. Or in China, for that matter. It's just a whole different concept of how you deal with social relationships. It sounds like a cliché to say it's just an East vs West thing but seriously .. there is a big gap, and FB is affirmatively on the ""West"" side...<p>update: I'd like to add an example. One of my best friends in Japan has an auntie who is engaged in a <i>two decade</i> long affair with a married salaryman. Basically a mistress. This is very common. I learnt the rules very very quickly - say nothing and accept everyone at face value. Give nothing away. Everyone knows what's going on but everyone just ignores it - it's their right to do what they want.<p>So what the hell would these people write on FB? Taking pictures with each other? Writing blog entries about how they spent the night together? This stuff should never be written down or recorded in any way. It's hard to explain but this is a basic tenet of their society and it's kind of central to their concept of respect. You never, ever divulge anything about the people you know. Those who have been in the military may understand what I am talking about - a set of rules for people getting along for extended periods in close quarters. It is actually pretty similar. You never, ever dob. This is antithetical to FB, IMO.<p>Complex relationships should never be aired in public, least of all in some glib, context-free ""status update"" or shared picture. Living under this kind of social regime .. can you imagine suddenly being taken by the irresistible urge to let it all hang on on FB and facing? Me neither.",1264170396

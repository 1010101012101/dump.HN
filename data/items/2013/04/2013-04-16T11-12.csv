To them, it's war, formally declared or not.<p>Regarding the Japanese: I understand that it was a volunteer force. Where was the threat of being shot?<p>From wiki <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze#Recruitment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze#Recruitment</a><p><i>It was claimed by the Japanese forces at the time that there were many volunteers for the suicidal forces. Captain Motoharu Okamura commented that ""there were so many volunteers for suicide missions that he referred to them as a swarm of bees,"" explaining: ""Bees die after they have stung.""[32] Okamura is credited with being the first to propose the kamikaze attacks. He had expressed his desire to lead a volunteer group of suicide attacks some four months before Admiral Takijiro Ohnishi, commander of the Japanese naval air forces in the Philippines, presented the idea to his staff. While Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome, commander of the second air fleet, was inspecting the 341st Air Group, Captain Okamura took the chance to express his ideas on crash-dive tactics. In our present situation I firmly believe that the only way to swing the war in our favor is to resort to crash-dive attacks with our planes. There is no other way. There will be more than enough volunteers for this chance to save our country, and I would like to command such an operation. Provide me with 300 planes and I will turn the tide of war.[33] When the volunteers arrived for duty in the corps there were twice as many persons than there were aircraft. ""After the war, some commanders would express regret for allowing superfluous crews to accompany sorties, sometimes squeezing themselves aboard bombers and fighters so as to encourage the suicide pilots and, it seems, join in the exultation of sinking a large enemy vessel."" Many of the kamikaze pilots believed their death would pay the debt they owed and show the love they had for their families, friends, and emperor. ""So eager were many minimally trained pilots to take part in suicide missions that when their sorties were delayed or aborted, the pilots became deeply despondent. Many of those who were selected for a bodycrashing mission were described as being extraordinarily blissful immediately before their final sortie.""[34]</i>",1366112434

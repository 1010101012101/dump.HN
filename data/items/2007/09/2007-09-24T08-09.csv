58815,comment,58641,58727,0,0,rms,,,">Doesn't tarnish, separate parts can be rejoined, scarce, hard to get more of it<p>This was important before the Information Age, but now there is no reason to have a lot of physical currency when you can just have ones and zeros. It's easier to use pure energy, the item that embodies scarcity, than something like gold that is much less useful. So it would make much more sense to use oil as the backing currency, or even pure electrical power.",1190623670

But if we were somehow able to bloodlessly kick out all the evil sociopaths in the government and replace them with individuals that wanted to help society as a whole, that would be very good for the value of the dollar. Unfortunately, this is impossible because of the overwhelming military firepower of the government and what appears to be an inevitable tendency towards corruption in democratic leadership.",1190623090

58810,comment,58025,58761,0,0,euccastro,,,"How do you even think about this stuff?  It's almost orthogonal to reason.  The only useful engagement point I can find is observing the characteristics, especially the limits, of my own experience.<p>I think there is some 'metafeeling tone' everywhere, and that the intensity of it is somehow associated to our concept of complex dynamic order.  Although it is a continuum, in parts of the universe that sport a dramatically greater amount of complex order than their surroundings, the feeling of such surroundings is lost as imperceptible line noise. Thus, isolated selves.<p>I think stars feel, although I can't see how their feelings could be much more interesting that those of a pot of boiling water.<p>The universe is more interesting.  Since it is 'everything', it holds all the complexity, all the order, all the chaos, all the information flow, everything that you could relate to consciousness, or to interesting consciousness.<p>Yet, at a macro level, and at any timescale that can be humanly grasped, I suspect the universe is a rather dumb thing.  AFAIK, there is not a terribly complex interplay going on between the top level parts, and I imagine interesting subparts have independent consciousnesses of their own, that the universe is essentially blind to: I don't think the universe is more aware of us than we are of the neutrons in our bloodcells.",1190622739

People wouldn't want to loan or save a currency that changes value so much. The beauty with gold is the price would be stable, as to date no one's come up with a way of getting lots of it quickly and easily.",1190622453

Recurring billing via PayPal, for example, requires your customer to enter a hairy ""User Agreement"" giving you permission to charge them up to several hundred dollars/mo.

In the $10M case I clearly can't pay that but in the $50K case, I might be able to sell my car, move into a cheaper house, etc, in order to pay it. Am I protected in both cases? What about $10K? At what point is it ""OK, you can't pay this, go declare bankruptcy so you get to keep your personal assets""?<p>I think I need to hit the books...",1226454913

Of the core bits of the OS, lots of them are open sourced as well; Darwin is open source as well (and loosely based on NeXT, which isn't <i>that</i> closely related to BSD). The kernel is open source, bonjour, launchd, webkit, and so on. Apple contributes <i>a lot</i> to open source. Oh, most recent addition: <a href=""http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.5/autozone-77.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.5/autozone...</a> - the ObjC GC.<p>The biggest part of the OS that isn't open source is Aqua. But, really. Thats just the UI. And I'm always hearing about how good Compiz Fusion is supposed to be. So, <i>shrug</i>.",1226454911

They are looking into ""blocking of calls"", not ""blocking calls"".<p>Just because American-English has conditioned the world that ""Off of"" is the same as ""Off"" doesn't mean that ""of"" has no meaning.<p>I don't know whether it's anticompetetive to block such calls, but it probably hinges on whether we take telephone to mean ""a telephone (traditional)"", ""any device that looks and acts like a traditional telephone (e.g. USB skypephone)"" or ""any system that carries speech between some number of particular persons over some distance"".<p>Depending on which you choose, you get a different answer and interpretation. There was a local case recently where a ferry-bridge was classed as a bridge, because it's on a chain fixed between two points, and the local authority wanted it reclassified as a boat because it floats, so they could up the harbour taxes 40x. The counter argument was that it only floats between two points winching itself along a chain, what kind of useless ""boat"" is that?<p>As I see it, it's clearly not a good fit for either definition, and thus the argument is completely pointless. This is similar - it's not at all a classic phonecall, so don't treat it like that. They're providing a data service and limiting the types of data that can be sent, that's what should be under investigation. It's a nontechnical restriction designed to bump up profits. Either limit the data rate or latency or max transfer allowance, or adjust your charges to be profitable with increased use, but stay out of what it's used for (legal concerns excepted).",1226454647

361237,comment,361153,361153,0,0,jd,,,"People often write in higher level languages because they want lots of bad code fast. Almost all business applications are CRUD apps (create/retrieve/update/destroy) with some business logic, and they're generally written in C#. The app may crash when you click the wrong button, but the app is cheap to develop and the programmers are easily replaceable.<p>Of course I'm generalizing, and a lot of C# programmers write great and reliable code. The point is that they often don't -need- to write great code, because lousy code is good enough for all business purposes (except when the software is your product, which is rarely the case).<p>The second issue is that people who choose C for their projects tend to (a) understand low-level concepts, (b) care about speed / memory usage / reliability / dependencies, (c) don't consider development time that important. That you create more reliable software that way is obvious - the same programmers would create reliable software in C# (or similar language). But there aren't many situations in which development speed doesn't matter, speed and memory usage don't matter, dependencies don't matter but, for some reason, reliability is very important.",1226453640

It would be really nice if all error possibilities were listed in the documentation so I could pick precisely what to handle.",1226453567
361235,comment,361153,361153,0,0,jwilliams,,,"The thing about C is that you are generally very aware of the side effects. Aside from the libraries you use, the (data) structures are yours. When you set something to NULL, you know damn well that that means to you.<p>As the author alludes to as well - in C you're made more aware of the error conditions you can handle and the ones you can't. So you can code to a level of robustness... Exceptions in Java are all well and good, but I haven't seen many implementations that <i>do</i> anything with IOException except for cascade it.<p>This works really well for programs/modules that can fit in the head of a single programmer. When you go beyond that it gets pretty messy - which is where some of the advantages of metaphors like OO start to help... Course, there is the argument that modules should never get that big, but that's another debate.",1226453517

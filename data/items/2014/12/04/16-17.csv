It&#x27;s far better from a UX perspective to let the user do whatever they want <i>without</i> stopping them but inform them that there&#x27;s a problem at the first opportunity.

8700198,comment,8693788,8698098,0,0,mraleph,,,"> V8 VM optimized for that (type dynamics).\n> Dart VM has a lot problem with performance with this dynamics<p>This claim is substantially false. Where are you deriving this &quot;Dart VM has a lot problem...&quot; from? (feel free to respond in Russian). If you actually knew how V8 is implemented you would know that all values in the V8 have something called a <i>hidden class</i> (internally in the sources it&#x27;s called <i>map</i>) and V8 optimizes based on identity of those hidden classes. This is not that different from the Dart - classes are just not <i>hidden</i> in Dart.<p>> A lot of (problematic) method in these list. Dart VM code generators and optimizers is unable to optimize usage of them by the Dart VM intelligence.<p>You are misunderstanding/misrepresenting why these lists exist. Let&#x27;s talk about them one by one.<p>1. <i>INTRINSICS</i> Most methods on the <i>intrinsic</i> list don&#x27;t even have pure-Dart bodies (so there is nothing to optimized with &quot;Dart VM intelligence&quot;) and they are on the list for two purposes:<p>- provide fast hand written assembly implementation, that is more efficient version written in C++;\n- tell optimizing compiler how to lower these instructions into IR operations.<p>Without them being on the list there is no way optimizing compiler can optimize anything - because it would only see a call to some native runtime function with unknown semantics. How is it supposed to understand that _TypedList._getFloat64 is actually a pair of a CheckArrayBound and LoadIndexed<Double>() instructions?<p>Some of these <i>intrinsified</i> methods do have Dart bodies - but we still provide a hand-written assembly implementation for them. I think these days it&#x27;s limited to methods of the Bigint class. This is the same in any arbitrary width integer library (e.g. look into GMP sources) - you can write it in C++ but people still write these things in assembly because even C++ can&#x27;t always produce the best code for this.<p>2. <i>INLINING_WHITELIST</i> These are the methods that that we know are usually beneficial to inline into the caller&#x27;s code even if other budget constraints are preventing it. Inlining is a very hard problem in compiler construction - it&#x27;s impossible to always make optimal decisions given compilation time constraints of the JIT. Even AOT compilers need hints for this, and if you take a random JIT you will discover that it most likely has a similar whitelist built in. Essentially this white list is here precisely because we know that we can optimize this methods very well once they are inlined (which is complete opposite of &quot;cannot be optimized&quot; that you invoke).<p>3. <i>INLINING_BLACKLIST</i> Similar to whitelist it contains functions that we know are not beneficial to inline. Limited to Bigint class actually now, which is a very special case as explained above.<p>4. <i>POLYMORPHIC_TARGET_LIST</i> this is utility list that improves the structure of the graph that polymorphic inliner builds (it tells inliner that resulting code would <i>not</i> benefit from merging different branches of the polymorphic call even if they share the same target). <i>None</i> of the methods on this list have an actual Dart body.<p>To summarize all these lists exist because they encode knowledge that is impossible for Dart VM to get because those properties are essentially algorithmically undecidable.",1417712251

The system is arguably less broken than internet libertarians think.<p>It&#x27;s often surprisingly difficult to prosecute somebody for repeat breaking and entering or gun violence, but the cops generally know who is causing the problems, so they get them on drug possession. This is where the crack cocaine sentencing disparity comes from. Crack affected communities demanded the law get the gang bangers off the streets, and crack possession was the obvious way to pop them.",1417711749

You&#x27;ll have to be converting between mutable and immutable data structures anywhere the two interact.

Or forcing the functional developer to write in a largely imperative style due to the mutable data structures that prevent copying from being efficient, and can be mutated any time they pass out of his/her code.<p>Or to put it another way; Scala as an idea may be fine; you can mix imperative and functional together, by picking which data structure and approach for a given problem is &#x27;right&#x27;.

The packet contains some information.  But, the developer may package it in an infinite number of ways.  I would say that a &#x27;non-abstract&#x27; packet would be one that would contain all possible state of the system.  It would be akin to photo-realistic paintings or perhaps photography.  But, I would say that an &#x27;abstract&#x27; packet would be one that contains the least amount of structure and metadata for the primary information to be passed.  Maybe it&#x27;s not a good analogy - I&#x27;m just coming up with something on the fly.<p>Picasso experimented a lot with this.  Take a look at his bull drawings.

Then consider if the teacher was a secularist trying to find ways to sneak messages about evolution or atheism or even material that treated different belief systems with equal weight or validity.<p>While I don&#x27;t know of anyplace in my own country where a fundamentalist ideology is as entrenched as the North Koreans&#x27; is in Pyongyang, it&#x27;s still easy for me to conceptualize.  In the U.S. there are no doubt schools where a teacher speaking about secularism would prompt students to resist and parents to complain.<p>With a country like DPRK, I just imagine it as if the most conservative, fundamentalist parts of the US were cut off from the rest of the country and never even had anyone try to argue that man probably didn&#x27;t walk with the dinosaurs or that gay people didn&#x27;t murder babies or whatever.  Even if there were people who thought it was all bunk they&#x27;d probably keep quiet or risk getting fired.<p>Add to that the fact that in DPRK you run the actual risk of being sent to a prison camp for questioning the accepted ideology and I can see why it might just be easier to play along.

8699954,comment,8698166,8698166,0,0,akolbe,,,"The simple story is that the Wikimedia Foundation staff has massively expanded over the past six or seven years; both the revenue and their spending have risen exponentially (from 2 million in 2006/2007 to over $40 million in 2013/2014). Most of this increase in spending has funded the expansion of software engineering staff. It doesn&#x27;t help that some of their flagship projects have been acknowledged failures (VisualEditor) or extremely controversial and divisive (Media Viewer, Flow). That&#x27;s partly why Lila Tretikov was hired: to sort that mess out. And some spending was profligate, as Sue Gardner herself acknowledged, with gravy trains forming and supporting previously penniless Wikipedians. And as the spending increases, so of course the reserve has to increase too, to the point where there are now shooting for more than $50 million a year (compare to $5 million in 2007/2008).<p>The Foundation feel they have to expand because Wikipedia content is free, and is increasingly hosted elsewhere. Wikipedia could survive that, but the Wikimedia Foundation could not. Damon Sicore, the new VP of Engineering Tretikov hired, said the Foundation would have to<p>“scale to a size that enables us to compete with the engineering shops that are trying to kill us. That means we need to double down on recruiting top talent, and steal the engineers from the sources they use… because… well… they are REALLY GOOD. I want everyone to keep this in mind: If we don’t move faster and better than google, apple, and microsoft (and their ilk and kin), they will consume us and we will go away. It’s that simple.”<p>Now he may very well be right there. The problem with the current fundraising campaign though is that it tries to manipulate donors into donating, by making it sound there is a financial emergency and the Foundation can not afford to keep Wikipedia &quot;online and ad-free for another year&quot; without people donating. When in fact they have just reported having more money in the bank than ever before in their entire history.<p>That, and the obtrusiveness of the banners, is what is rubbing people the wrong way. You have long-term, committed Wikipedians now telling Wikimedia management that the campaign is deceptive, manipulative and damaging to the brand, and that they are ashamed to answer their friends and colleagues when they ask him about the financial problems of Wikipedia.<p>That discussion is here: <a href=""http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/532701"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/532701</a><p>Some quotes:<p>A Wikimedia staffer:<p>I agree that the urgency and alarm of the copy is not commensurate with my (admittedly limited) understanding of our financial situation. Could we run a survey that places the banner copy alongside a concise statement of the Foundation&#x27;s financials, and which asks the respondent to indicate whether they regard the copy as misleading.<p>An ex-staffer:<p>The messaging being used is actively scaring people.

But the lights won&#x27;t go off next week if You don&#x27;t donate.<p>A Wikipedia admin, and past president of Wikimedia Australia:<p>Lila, the concern is not that the fundraiser is working, which your soundbite confirms, but that it is deceiving people, or at least manipulating them &#x27;too much&#x27; to be consistent with our values.<p>Ex-Wikimedia staffer:<p>You have a community that&#x27;s upset because they believe the fundraising banners are causing long-lasting harm to Wikimedia&#x27;s brand.<p>This year I&#x27;ve started having people I know worry that Wikipedia is in financial trouble.

Heavy utilisation RIs have been available since forever, and are extremely price competitive with every other major competitor in the cloud infrastructure space (namely Google, and Azure).<p>The big difference is that with AWS, I am probably &quot;stuck&quot; with an instance for 1-3 years, unless I want to take my chances with the hit-or-miss reservation marketplace. This is a really bad fit for some businesses that are still vertically scaling, but don&#x27;t have deep pockets. AWS can still make sense for companies on a budget because of their great portfolio of services, but EC2 is by far the most inconvenient billing-wise.<p>For example, we reserved an m3.large RDS instance, which at the time left us more than enough breathing room. About four months went by, and traffic grew far faster than projections. We weren&#x27;t hurting, but we now wanted to bump to a m3.xlarge to feel comfortable, even after a round of optimizations and profiling. We&#x27;re stuck with that 1-year reservation&#x27;s sunk cost, and have no use for the old m3.large reservation if we switch to m3.xlarge.<p>The other fun part was buying a 3-year m1.medium reservation, only to see the new m3 series instances come out before those three years were up. These new instance types have been landing pretty frequently.<p>Reservations shift a lot of &quot;risk&quot; on to the customer and away from Amazon. GCE&#x27;s pricing model is harder to estimate your bill with, but I actually like the idea of not being &quot;stuck&quot; if I want to be economical. Automatically give me discounts for instances that I run often, but don&#x27;t lock me down.",1417709737

You can implement an answer-set language on top of it in order to make it easier to use for yourself or collaborators in pure-Python... but writing AST-transforming code using Python&#x27;s `ast` module is a huge pain. Just sprinkle some parens around and you can treat the Python AST as if it were just another plain-old-datastructure. It becomes magnitudes easier to write your answer-set solver&#x27;s language interface.<p>And because Hy is freely importable from Python code you can simply use it to write that front-end compiler for your constraint solver.

Hy&#x27;s goal is to be bidirectional, so there are a few things here and there that doesn&#x27;t feel as lispy as it should. Like having data returned when you use assoc as an example. The scoping is an issue aswell, like let-over-lambdas doesn&#x27;t work, and iteration over maps isn&#x27;t as fluid as it is in Clojure.",1417709022

But for an ordinary day to day commute, people shouldn&#x27;t have to be at the top of their game. I think your point boils down to variance. Human drivers have a high variance, we all can be very good or very bad somewhat randomly.<p>Your point about research is really interesting. I think a large majority of cars actually following the speed limit, looking before changing lanes, and using turn signals will have a positive effect on overall safety, even if they aren&#x27;t anywhere near as good at dealing with extraordinary situations. It would be nice to know what % of &quot;good drivers&quot; is required to minimize those extraordinary situations, if any at all.<p>We&#x27;ve all seen that one car weaving in and out of traffic. Perhaps they do indeed make us safer because they force us to pay attention. But they do seem to create a whole bunch of extraordinary situations for dozens or hundreds of drivers to deal with. It only takes the one weak driver (i&#x27;m assuming weaker than self driving here) to panic and then the freeway is a parking lot for an hour. That research would be interesting.",1417708978

An internal application cannot afford that type of resistance.<p>If you had said simpler and more efficient interfaces I would have agreed.

My website started getting some traffic so thought I&#x27;d put together a really comprehensive tutorial on how to play MIDI files on iOS. I started selling it on my site for around $19.99 and started making a couple of hundred dollars per month. Then one of the founders of <a href=""http://www.binpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com</a> reached out to me and asked if I&#x27;d consider putting my component on their site. I decided to go for it and with the added exposure it started bringing in around $400 - $500 per month. Then I decided to spend my spare time making components to save other developers time on common tasks. I developed a piano plugin and then a chat component (<a href=""http://www.binpress.com/app/chat-messaging-sdk-for-ios/1644"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com/app/chat-messaging-sdk-for-ios/1644</a>). The chat component did really well so over time I built it up - currently it brings in about $2k per month in sales and loads of consulting work. Because of the chat component, I was approached by the Founders of Firebase because they wanted to shut down an online chat service they had called Envolve. They asked if I&#x27;d be prepared to make an alternative service and take on their customer base. I took on the project and developed a new chat called Chatcat (<a href=""http://chatcat.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chatcat.io</a>). Currently, I&#x27;m making about $4 - 5k per month in passive revenue from Binpress and the chat. On top of that I can easily make another $5k in freelance work. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this as a low risk path to generating a really stable passive revenue.",1417708864

The more I learned about the differences between gpl/bsd and the more I thought about the philosophical underpinnings, the more I am convinced that Richard Stallman, while eccentric and sometimes hard to bear for some, was and is a man ahead of his time, and that he is absolutely right when he talks about the four freedoms.<p>Despite this, at my recent new position, I gave in and decided to dive into the apple ecosystem because &quot;spend less time fixing your system and more time working!&quot; was what I kept getting told.

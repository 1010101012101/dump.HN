Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 10-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc.\nWays we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:\n- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from\n- every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer\n- actively upgrading our version of Rails, and not stopping until we hit bleeding edge. We hit Rails 2.3.14 last week and hope to hit 3.0.11 within the month\n- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise\n- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves\nCauses is a great place to better yourself and better the world.

3784507,comment,3783367,3784022,2,0,morsch,,,"At least here in Germany, in many ways, the two-years ""consumer complaint time"" works out as an implied warranty. When I'm not discussing the difference between Apple's manufacturer warranty (<i>Garantie</i> in German) and the legally required one (<i>Gewhrleistung</i>), I'd simply translate it as warranty. If anything, the protection offered by the <i>Gewhrleistung</i> extend beyond the ones offered my many manufacturer warranties.<p>If any piece of electronics dies within two years \nthat's not <i>expected</i> the die from mere use (e.g. laptop batteries), I immediately return it to the shop I bought it from (not the manufacturer) and I can typically expect some sort of remedy; repair, replacement or a refund. I'm not sure how much of it directly derives from the EU regulations, I sort of expected it to be very similar in other EU countries but I might be wrong.<p>Incidentally, we also get fourteen days to return anything bought online for a full refund, no questions asked, including shipping costs for for stuff >40 EUR.

If the warranty is high, the additional support costs will added to the product price, such that the support penalty is effectively shared between the customers. On the other side, if the warranty period is short, the product price will be lower, but a small number of customers must pay a lot to repair their devices out of warranty. Then one needs to take into consideration that there are many ways to break a device by being ""sloppy"" but not fall outside warranty constrains. I try to be careful with the devices I own and in the first case I would have to pay for the carelessness of other people and I don't like that. On the other side high repair cost can be a large burden to single individuals, which is when it is reasonable to share risks in the community (see, e.g., medical costs).<p>This is why I guess the European law is basically about getting a working device in the first place and not about how repair costs are being distributed, which is non-obvious to decide.",1333304208

I scrolled thru, saw a female, and clicked thru to her Facebook profile.<p>Girls Around Me, while tacky, isn't that different. If I were a stalker it would be useless, I'd have to use the Foursquare app instead, because Girls Around Me doesn't let me follow individual users... <i>Foursquare does that.</i><p>I feel like this is just the app that is saying what everyone knows - social networking can easily be creepy.<p>Also - it was a lot easier in this mall to find girls by walking around and looking at them. I have a feeling if I were a predator this is probably what I'd do. The information about their location is in real time and they can't opt out or choose to make it visible to friends only. They're in public, and if they chose to share this info on Foursquare it's even more public.",1333304164

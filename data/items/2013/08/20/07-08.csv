In fact, he&#x27;s explicitly suggesting that the same issues that exist with threads don&#x27;t happen, or are at least significantly diminished.<p>I&#x27;ll happily admit that if you treat coroutines like threads and lock where you&#x27;re supposed to, the failure modes are the same. However, since nothing <i>appears</i> to break if you get it wrong (synchronization-related failures that only show up under load, and when they do, they show up by silently clobbering some data), I suggest that there&#x27;s way too much room for people to get it wrong there. (My personal anecdotal evidence appears to corroborate this.)<p>Furthermore, in many cases there are simple ways you can make a synchronous library look async in twisted: deferToThread is the most common/obvious one.<p>So, yes, you get all of that wonderful manual CSP stuff! I guess I just don&#x27;t agree with you that that&#x27;s a benefit.<p>Can you give a practical example of where you used a semaphore to synchronize shared mutable state access? I&#x27;ve only used it for, say, concurrency limiting, I think.<p>I&#x27;m actually very interested in actor-based concurrency, and I think many of my fellow Twisted developers with me (we have a good contingent of actor + obj-capa fanboys).

So it&#x27;s real slim and all it does is serve data. And your client side will be the one responsible for rendering the data.<p>This also may forces your layout code to be front end, which people can steal, but it put more emphasis on the value of your data. Then again you can steal webpage design css/html all the time... likewise with javascript anyway.<p>And another reason for using client side MVC is because they want their web application to act like an application and less of a webpage so you&#x27;ll hear the term single page application a lot. It&#x27;s a whole a trend, they created AJAX so it&#x27;s less like a webpage more like a web application.<p>Of course it depends on your project/website and it requirement and if it&#x27;s more like an application or more of a website.<p>There are some drawbacks to this, SEO namely for angular but you can have work around like phantomjs.

And the product people get run out of the decision-making forums. The companies forget how to make great products. The product sensibility and product genius that brought them to this monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product vs. a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship thats required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts about wanting to help the costumers.<p>> .... companies get confused. When they start getting bigger, they want to replicate their initial success. And a lot of them think, Well, somehow, theres some magic in the process of how that success was created. So they start to institutionalize process across the company. And before very long, people start to get confused that the process is the content. And thats ultimately the downfall of IBM.",1376984820

It is very difficult to overstate the extent to which &quot;government people&quot; live in a bubble. In many ways, they are working from an entirely different set of first principles than those used by most of the HN-reading world. As such, it is difficult for &quot;us&quot; to understand why &quot;they&quot; do what they do, and very <i>easy</i> for us to come up with our own (usually incorrect, or at the very least, incomplete) explanations for their behavior.<p>Of course, the converse is generally true: the laughably incorrect explanations that &quot;government people&quot; always seem to come up with  for &quot;our&quot; behavior often are the result of them interpreting events, statements, etc. through their lens- a lens informed by a completely different set of optical principles than the ones that we are used to using (to abuse the  figure of speech a little bit).<p>In other words, when you read or hear about a &quot;government person&quot; doing or saying something head-deskingly stupid, the odds are very good that the statement or action made perfect sense in the context of that government person&#x27;s world. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re (necessarily) stupid, or even ignorant- just that they&#x27;re not living in our world, and so have dramatically different motivations, constraints, first principles, etc. etc. Their actions may be perfectly follow an internal logic- but it&#x27;s not our logic, and so we have a hard time making sense of it.<p>And all of this goes double or triple when we&#x27;re talking about military or IC people.

That doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to regress every single discussion to philosophizing by using hyperbole such that the discussion of the issues is obstructed by the discussion of your personal philosophy. The vast majority of people do not equate taxation with threat of death, so every time that is brought into the conversation, it completely derails the conversation and makes it unproductive. And no, it is not a more practical argument than I give it credit for. It is a slippery slope argument at best, and that is being exceedingly charitable.<p>Back to the issue at hand, the unhealthy/toxic distinction was just to try to get you to rethink your assumptions (doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked). The real objection I have is the one you chose not to respond to: drastically unhealthy choices by other citizens are born by everyone else through increased costs of health care and insurance. Inevitably your response is that forcing anyone to pay for the health care of anyone else is an act of violence and therefore not permissible according to your libertarian ethics, but that means that we have to let people simply fall over dead if they can&#x27;t pay for treatment, which in the opinion of most is a far greater moral wrong.

Why wouldn&#x27;t a digital recording of something you said be? Because you own it and the court doesn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to search it without probably cause in the first place.<p>> The communications that they send and receive should be subject to well-overseen surveillance<p>Surveillance, all-seeing all-knowing citizen-watching and suspicion-free spying is not okay. Targeted, with-warrant wiretaps are (maybe) a different story. Maybe I define this different than most (please chime in with your own) but the word surveillance means to me that you&#x27;re being watched from above with many other also-innocent people.",1376982274

Currently a block spanning N columns on a desktop must span N columns or 1 column on a mobile device. This means you can&#x27;t have a 6x2 grid become a 2 by 6 grid on mobiles. It will have to be 12 blocks stacked on top of one another.<p>Inuit is another framework that allows for this though it lacks in documentation and a user friendly website.",1376982274

It is about everything, from the touch screen to the heads-up navigation, to the automatic handles, the interior space, and even the fact that it&#x27;s electric.

I was detained crossing the Canadian border for an hour as the border patrol read through my personal emails on my phone and who knows what else. If I hadn&#x27;t supplied the password willingly to them, I&#x27;m sure they would have refused me entry, so I couldn&#x27;t do much about it. But having an OS to boot into on any device that&#x27;s pretty cleared out and submitting that willingly works much better over denying the password. Of course, if you have any really sensitive stuff, this method wouldn&#x27;t work super well, as the devices could be searched more thoroughly, but to stop harassment when crossing borders, at police stops, etc. I think it&#x27;s a good idea.",1376982098

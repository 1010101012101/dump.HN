<a href=""http://constitutionaldaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1153:throw-grandma-from-the-train&catid=49:the-philadelphia-lawyer&Itemid=65"" rel=""nofollow"">http://constitutionaldaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&...</a><p>To quote:
&quot;here&#x27;s seventy-five percent of the reason the Fed, and Washington, are ignoring employment and focusing exclusively on asset inflation:<p>If asset values fell as they should have in a true free market correction, which we were due, an enormous percentage of the old and elderly would be rendered insolvent. We would have a societal disaster on our hands.<p>And so we decided to screw the the young - the more resilient group - to protect the old.&quot;<p>&quot;It can be argued, and should be, that the old are the weakest, and that we have a duty to protect them most. But a far more compelling point is that a nation fixated solely on subsidizing its old at cost of the futures of its young is a nation headed for a fall. The more we prop up housing, freezing out the young, the less we give youth a sense of equity in their communities, a &quot;skin in the game,&quot; both literally and existentially. The more we funnel every economic fix through Wall Street, to protect the old and invested first, with scraps for Main Street, the fewer jobs we create for the kids. The more we spend on pointless health care for the near dead, the fewer options we have to control costs, and consequently, the less hiring we&#x27;ll see.&quot;<p>&quot;But if there&#x27;s a real battle out there, it&#x27;s generational - between the young and the old. Between those we need to offer futures, and those we&#x27;ve more than adequately coddled.<p>Grandma&#x27;s ticket on the gravy train is up. It&#x27;s time we start seriously discussing how and when her austerity starts - how we get her off to make room for the kids. Eased out at the next station, or shoved through the nearest exit door when the engine can no longer handle the overcrowded cars?&quot;",1431262742

9519758,comment,9519575,9519680,0,0,john-waterwood,,,"JSF and EJB are the reason why Java EE is lately considered the &quot;secret weapon&quot;.<p>The fact is that both invoke memories of old times where they were very heavyweight and problematic technologies.<p>EJB was a total disaster, where you needed to implement 3 interfaces and inherit from a framework provided base class, compile your code with a special &quot;enhancing&quot; tool and run yet another tool to generate something called stubs and skeletons, just to do hello world.<p>Modern EJB on the other hand is a POJO with a single annotation:<p><pre><code>    @Stateless
    public class Bean {
        // do something 
    }
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s all. There are no required framework or business interfaces, no obligation to put ejb beans in a separate EJB module and there are no specific compiler tools needed. It&#x27;s a total day and night difference.<p>In modern Java EE there&#x27;s no reason whatsoever to avoid EJB.<p>There&#x27;s a similar story with JSF. The first versions (1.x) were mostly POST focused, had heavy session space requirements, and components were hard to create.<p>In modern JSF 2.x, there&#x27;s first class support for using GET, and the PRG pattern is at the heart of interactions that are logically POST. Session requiremebts are largely minimized by use of a partial state saving (only changes to state are saved) and a stateless mode (nothing is saved). You can use plain html to author pages with a single extra namespaced attribute to mark it as a component to JSF.<p>Again a night and day difference and no need to avoid it anymore.<p>Then JSF has a number of very cool extensions available such as PrimeFaces (beautiful visual components) and OmniFaces (Swiss army knife like Guave is for plain Java)",1431262282

Splitting a method into n different ones, none of which is called more than once is setting up the code for opportunistic reuse and obscures it&#x27;s true function.<p>Sometimes, but in general I don&#x27;t agree.<p>If the functions are made private and giving appropriate names than it&#x27;s really a way of self-documenting code, which helps.<p>Suppose you have:<p><pre><code>    some_function() {
        // Calculate interest
        // 100 lines of code

        // Apply tax
        // 120 lines of code

        // Store results
        // 30 lines of code
    }
</code></pre>
Then the need to have those &quot;banner comments&quot; there already indicate it might be a good idea to decompose the function into:<p><pre><code>    some_function() {
        calculate_interest(...);
        apply_tax(...);
        store_results(...);
    }

It&#x27;s not just about reuse, but about documenting what each section of code does, and about limiting interactions between arbitrary sets of variables.

Have a look at sites like Wufoo or Thinkature. They have complex concepts too, but they know how to present them in a way that draws users in.<p>You don't need to have import data and export data as links on the front page, especially when I can't even seem to do anything with your site without logging in. Just have ""Data import/export"" as a bullet point in your feature list; people will get the point.<p>Speaking of being able to do something with your site without logging in: this is vital. If you want me to make an account, you need to give me a reason to do it. Again, see Thinkature's site, or Adobe's kuler. If you can provide even a subset of the site's functionality to people who aren't logged in, you'll get more signups. Even if you can't do that, it helps if you can explain why the heck I'd want to use your service, like Wufoo does.",1180963166

The article discusses a well known example of the failure of an inflexible monolithic defense system faced with an enemy schooled in asymmetric warfare.  The J-35 is to the naval fleet C2 net as the drone swarm is to the armada of small suicide boats.<p>> Cheap drones are not going to be carrying...<p>Solid rocket boosters and pointy nose cones?  The drones are the missiles.  As far as targeting, anti-tank missiles have had a great deal of success without fancy radar arrays - just object recognition in extremely noisy environments.  I see no reason why that would be impossible for this application.<p>> How are your &quot;light comms&quot; going to work at night...<p>Better<p>> ...or in inclement weather...<p>Ask the Navy, they managed to make it work for a long time without computer aided signal processing.<p>> Think you can see a spotlight in daytime at 20K?<p>LOL, the Germans managed to get a range of 4KM (13K feet) in WWI, in broad daylight, with handheld light signals [0].  So yeah, I think you can see a spotlight in daylight from 20 thousand feet in the year 2016.<p>> ...if we decide to truly let them function autonomously...<p>When you say we, do you mean every nation?  Because it will only take one to disrupt the whole game.<p>> ...it&#x27;s range will be very small compared to a jet fighter.<p>What?

This is assuming you know what you are doing and you have experience with e-commerce. (I was losing money for the first 3 months)<p>-Private labeling on Amazon using FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon)<p>I currently earn some passive income (~$1000/month) by selling products on Amazon. Amazon FBA is great because you just send all the products to Amazon warehouse and they will do the packaging and shipping for you. If you shipped out all the items yourself, it wouldn&#x27;t be so passive. But since all my items are currently at Amazon warehouse and everything&#x27;s being shipped by Amazon, I spend little time at the moment.<p>A summarized process will be\n1. Sign-up for Amazon seller account \n2. Find an item to sell on Alibaba\n3. Purchase the item, receive, check, and send to Amazon.\n4. Perform SEO for your product page\n5. Repeat 2 - 4\n6. After some success, switch to Amazon Seller Merchant Pro.<p>The most difficult part wasn&#x27;t finding the right item, but rather promoting the page. Ranking my product will involve tons of keyword research, pinning everything relevant on Pinterest, and revising copy-writing.<p>Once I start selling about 10 products/day for a single item, I&#x27;d move on to a new product. The best time to start probably is NOT at 3rd or 4th quarter. You want to have steady sales by 3rd quarter. Because if you do, you will experience some shockingly crazy sales starting November lasting until early January. If I now sell 10 units/day for product X, I was selling 100 units/day starting late November. I regret not stocking more items, but it was my first year doing this and it&#x27;s a lesson learned.",1454569074

NodeJs adoption is going up, but if someone is building a CLI for a Rust project using Vorpal, then I have to install another piece of software and bloat my local system. Imagine this goes into my docker container it means the overall size of my container will increase. Of course I typically also install a bunch of packages along with my Python project anyway, like requests library, but because these libraries are typically needed for my backend anyway, the CLI&#x27;s dependency on requests library is debt free. But in the case of me writing a Rust / Go / Python project but shipping a NodeJS CLI version, that&#x27;s pretty insane. But don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, I will write NodeJs and I will look at your library. You have great work, but I want to offer you my opinion on why few people outside of NodeJs will use this to build CLI for their X-language project.",1454568659

The more hyperconnected everything is, the more production of goods - information goods in particular - turn into sudden lottery wins when they reach criticality.<p>It&#x27;s always interested me that the more globally connected our media are, fewer interesting stories overall end up rising to our attention. When the sort function is global, global media all narrow in on a small handful of stories; whereas when the sort function is local, each region has its own distinct handful. This is a different kind of fan-in; the network structure supresses the feeding of stories into the fan-in from way down in the roots based on what&#x27;s already upstream, and you end up with less information.<p>This is distinct from the problem of attention flow on social networks; hyperconnection changes all sorts of flows, and they may not all be for the better.

Example: When a user changes permissions, the old code changes the live DB, while the new code changes the temporary DB.  Later (or continuously), you could also compare the databases to ensure they&#x27;re identical (easier if the datastore remains constant, a bit harder if you are changing to a different storage schema or product).<p>Where it would be in the difficult-to-impossible range is when touching on external services that don&#x27;t have the ability to copy state and set up a secondary test service, but even in that case, you could record the requests made (or that would have been made) and ensure they both would have done the same thing.<p>Definitely an interesting concept overall.",1454567889

Similar effects observed in Salmon and Tuna where there is mercury in the water. But the notion that just after the event it was so radioactive outside the containment vessels that it caused immediate fatalities would suggest 10s of Sieverts of exposure and that was not recorded or measured anywhere outside of the buildings AFAIK.<p>Not that I&#x27;m not glad that Yuricon is trying to commercialize vitrification.

8852489,comment,8850482,8851918,0,0,jerf,,,"The idea of the broken window theory isn&#x27;t that the window was broken was any particular way. The idea is that the visual image of a broken window serves as a signal that the degree of social concern/cohesion/enforcement in the area is low, and will thus encourage further behaviors. Also, breaking the second window is psychologically easier than the first.<p>I say this without endorsement, just explanation. (I&#x27;m ready to believe the evidence suggests it doesn&#x27;t actually work and that the real drop in crime was another cause, but, on the other hand, academics can sometimes just be contrarians too, it&#x27;s not just an online thing, and I still give some credence to successful engineering efforts such that one ought to at least consider the original theory.)",1420657161

The idea that you can&#x27;t do anything with self signed certs and nothing makes them okay is a much more troublesome untruth, IMO.<p>Rejecting self-signed certs and only allowing users to use the broken CA PKI model is the wrong choice.  Browsers didn&#x27;t get it right.  The CA model is broken, is actually being used to decrypt people&#x27;s traffic and though your browser might pin a couple big sites, won&#x27;t protect the rest very well by default.

8852406,comment,8852327,8852327,0,0,api,,,"Oh lordy, where to begin...<p>(1) The startup world is full of creeps and psychos. There are a lot of sociopaths, vapid fast-talking wheeler-dealers, and people who are just flat out bat nuts crazy. There&#x27;s also been a huge influx of douchebags since tech became (supposedly) a way to get rich quick. I&#x27;ve been burned by this a couple times and have gotten better at judging character as a result, but be warned-- here be dragons.<p>(2) Credentialism is a lot stronger in startups than most people believe. Stanford degrees seem to count more than traction. In the end I just broke down and added &quot;did not attend Stanford or work for Google&quot; to my AngelList profile. If you care, you&#x27;re not going to like me anyway.<p>(3) Everything follows an extreme power law distribution, and it always implies a catch-22. If you don&#x27;t live in the Bay Area, it&#x27;s exponentially harder to get funding. If you do live in the Bay Area, you need a substantial exit event to afford a down payment on a modest post-WWII starter house. This also applies to incubators, startups you might join, employees you might recruit, etc.<p>(4) Trendy not-invented-last-week syndrome abounds on the technology side: <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/blog/2003/02/the-cadt-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/blog/2003/02/the-cadt-model/</a><p>(5) Given the quantities of money involved, I&#x27;d expect investors to be more rational than they really are. &quot;Raise on no numbers or good numbers&quot; -- that doesn&#x27;t exactly strike me as rational. No numbers is better than some growth? That&#x27;s not by any means the worst example either. I once had an investor type tell me with a straight face that he looks for founders with a &quot;prominent jaw line, an alpha male look.&quot;<p>(6) Founding or building something is lonely, thankless, isolating, and a lot longer of a death march than you probably realize... unless of course you are &quot;juiced&quot; in which case you can walk into a VC firm and walk out with millions for a product that doesn&#x27;t exist. Then you can hire people to build it while you wheel and deal and pimp your ego. The existence of this kind of &quot;juice&quot; can be enormously discouraging to mere mortals. It&#x27;s enough to make you wonder if this game isn&#x27;t as rigged as Wall Street. (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>quite</i> as rigged as Wall Street, but there&#x27;s definitely a privilege network.)<p>(7) With all the talk of innovation you hear from people like Peter Thiel, the reality is that the most profitable stuff is usually some kind of equity play on the rapid growth of some trendy thing that isn&#x27;t technically that interesting. Examples include Facebook, Snapchat, etc. If you want to extend the human life span, develop AI, or otherwise advance the human condition, sign up for a vow of poverty. The only hack around this seems to be to do something a bit more &quot;boring&quot; to make enough money to then do something more visionary. The poster boy for this is Elon Musk. There are also exceptions -- things that can be both profitable and interesting -- but those also tend to be the hardest death marches of all. While you&#x27;re struggling to create real value, someone else is making millions flipping some kind of social media app of the week.<p>(8) Mobile is the future this week. Last week it was the web. Next week it&#x27;ll be the Internet of Things and nobody will ever fund another mobile startup. Desktop is dead even though everyone builds absolutely everything on a desktop. See #4.<p>(9) Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you -- tech is sexist as hell and geek culture is misogynistic with a faint whiff of creepy pedophilia and other chthonic horrors. If you don&#x27;t have a penis, be prepared for subtile hazing and grunt work and possibly drool on your seat cushion. Racism exists too, but it&#x27;s less stark and omnipresent than the misogyny.<p>(10) Age-ism is big too, and it contributes a lot to #8 and #4. A big reason for this is that all the incubator and accelerator programs are geared toward unmarried childless recent college grads who can move on a whim, room with six other people, and special enzymes that can derive a full spectrum of nutrients from ramen and energy drinks.<p>I could keep going.<p>Yet I keep coming back for more.

When you choose to deliberately insult the cherished beliefs of violent extremists, in the real world you have to know that you are likely to cause some consequences.  (Let me be very clear here.  The violent extremists are morally responsible for the violent reaction.

I think that network-oriented defenses are not the right semantic for modern applications, as modern applications are no longer tied to physical semantics, or the semantics that modern hardware filters on.<p>-----<p>I have a different view on security. A lot of people are talking about defense in depth, and security being enforced by the network. I think although that kind of works, it&#x27;s largely a mistake. Security, as enforced by middleboxes is fundamentally flawed, especially as we see the proliferation of systems that are too complex, and rapidly changing for middleboxes to understand. Although, they can be a tool in laying defensive trenches, they are nothing more than a simple barrier.<p>I think that endpoint security is what needs to be enhanced. Looking at what&#x27;s been disclosed about malware recently (APTs: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat</a>), we need to focus on a few things:<p>1) Isolating components: Components, and processes themselves should be isolated from one another, and the operating system. A web server should be able to run malicious code without fear of it easily getting root access. We have tools to make this possible today, like Apparmor, and SELinux. The fact that distributing Apparmor, or SELinux profiles with applications today isn&#x27;t normal, makes me sad. This also probably means more unikernels, and lightweight hypervisors.<p>2) Modularization: We should do our best to split the components of a system up into small, well-understood pieces. Rather than trying to combine multiple components into one monolithic process, breaking up components into their individual components. I think Cloudflare&#x27;s work around Keyless SSL was great, but we&#x27;ve had HSMs for years -- that could have easily avoided such disasters as Heartbleed.<p>3) Decent abstractions: With the advent of further distributed systems, and modularization, we&#x27;re going to see more and more interfaces between systems crop up. Largely, CISOs are limited to what the systems, and networking team can do. These limits typically manifested themselves at layer 4 on the network side of the house, and limited layer 7 capabilities like URL filtering, and file system ACLs. I think we need better stories around resource access and authorization. For years, we&#x27;ve had systems like Kerberos which would have been a great building block, but yet goes unused. I hope we see X509, and GPG become more ubiquitous for access management, and encryption.",1420655558

The difference lies in the fact that they do serve as an automated rate limiting point, and have different methods for the hackers to extract out funds from them.<p>An example: if you have one hot wallet with the keys loaded in to the system, and a secondary warm wallet (basically, a wallet that will be swapped in as the hot wallet when the other runs out), you can secure the details of the warm wallet better, meaning that certain read access vulnerabilities will only be able to target the hot wallet. Of course, an attacker can empty the hot wallet, and then the details of the warm wallet will be exposed when it is loaded because of the same vulnerability, but this forces the system to have a chance to validate the current state of the world before the second wallet becomes vulnerable, which is not the case if both were being used as loaded hot wallets.<p>There are meaningful automated sanity checks and rate limiting tactics that can be used with automated warm/hot wallets.<p>Of course, if you have a $5mil hot wallet, you should probably hire a &quot;bitcoin banker&quot; or &quot;bitcoin teller&quot; to sit at a workstation and manually deal with some of these kinds of swaps and oversee the audits.

Although a police matter rather than something I have to pursue with &#x27;civil action&#x27; of my own, a lot of hoops have to be gone through before things happen.<p>So the original box - Dell &#x27;high end&#x27; from 2 years ago cost £800. Trying to work out what was wrong with it and then running around town + the internet to get a repair quote has taken a good day of my time. This was quite an effort with a lot of repair shops just not able to give a quote just like that. Either they want £50 for just the quote or they don&#x27;t want to bother with it as it is too much hassle - fair enough. Eventually - thank my lucky stars - I get a quote for £417 from some small repair shop, this was just the ticket I needed to be able to help the police proceed with some action.<p>The thief have allegedly had their &#x27;bail hearing&#x27; and I am none the wiser as to what happened. Even if they were going to pay the £417 the quote came to I doubt that I would want it fixed given the hassle involved in that. A new replacement machine is what I would like, not something that has the scars of quite a traumatic incident. Even though prices go down it still costs ~£800 to get a similar PC (i7, HD screen, backlit keyboard, 8Gb RAM, aluminium case). A £400 &#x27;High Street&#x27; machine might be pretty good but I doubt I will get the magic &#x27;i7&#x27; badge.<p>So the costs - I needed the machine for out of hours support so other arrangements had to be made for that. I spent quite a lot of time with the police at the time of the incident and following things up running around to repair shops - surprisingly draining. Plus the story is not over yet, by the time I am done it could be a week&#x27;s worth of effort to get the thing back, and that is assuming that the thief just comes up with the money.<p>How do I value my time? If I look at lowest of the low contractor rate as a starting point and imagine how much a few days work for a client could be then my time spent running around for some notional £417 could be more profitable. Plus I would achieve something.<p>Oddly though, even though I am &#x27;turn the other cheek&#x27;, in this case I am keen that the thief has the criminal record and the difficulty of getting £££ together. The fact that £417 does not buy me a replacement &#x27;i7&#x27; machine (with backlit keyboard, HD screen and 8Gb RAM) is in some ways a detail.<p>Although I have had the help of the police I am surprised at how things work out - thief released under caution and some assumption that I don&#x27;t deserve my machine simply replaced - &#x27;like for like&#x27; and not patched up together again.

The truth is that it is always hard to make money, and always will be. To see why, we can reverse it in our heads: do you think carefully about how you spend your money? Me too; and so does everyone else. That&#x27;s the hump a product or service needs to get over before it can make much money. And it&#x27;s true 100% of the time.<p>When a product or service looks like an easy way to make money, what&#x27;s really happening is that it&#x27;s a great product or service, so it gets over the hump more easily.<p>Another big misconception is that they think that ideas make money. They say, &quot;there&#x27;s already a great time-tracking app in the App Store,&quot; and think, &quot;so it&#x27;s not an idea worth pursuing, because it already succeeded.&quot;<p>The reality is that execution and operations are what make money--which means that many businesses executing on the same idea can all make money. How many dry cleaners are there in the U.S.? How many pen manufacturers? How many car companies? How many Mexican restaurants? Or car washes?<p>It&#x27;s extremely rare that a concept is totally dominated by one large company. But because it is rare, those stories are endlessly told and retold within the culture. So if people are not thinking carefully, they can come to (paradoxically) perceive those rare types of companies to be the norm.<p>Here&#x27;s a fun exercise: pull up the list of the Fortune 500 companies and see how many names you recognize. These are all huge businesses, but most people will not even recognize half of them.

For an example of a field in which peer review does not appear to be problematic consider finance/econ.  In finance and econ you march you paper around to a number of different conferences. At AFA you even get a discussant that presents a critique after you present your work. After evolving the paper based on feedback from the conference circuit you eventually submit to a journal. At this point your work has been (hopefully) widely circulated in the community and is unlikely to be some piece of crap.<p>Contrast this with engineering.

8852205,comment,8844848,8844848,0,0,edohnberg,,,"Full disclosure, I’m both a graduate from a coding bootcamp and an employee at that same company (Bitmaker Labs).<p>There are quite a few assumptions being made in messages on here. I think that’s partially because coding bootcamps are very different from one another. For instance, the students we have at Bitmaker Labs typically have little-to-no experience coding, whereas shawndrost of Hack Reactor points out that many of their students have coded on the side for a year or two. I can’t speak to how everyone in this industry recruits, but I can share what I’ve seen in my experience with Bitmaker Labs over the past two years:<p><i>- The number of open web development positions is exceptionally high and the barriers to entry (i.e. prerequisite diplomas, degrees, etc.) are very low in many cases.</i><p>Several people have already touched on this point. Ultimately, a student’s abilities are more important than their credentials. So when you have an industry with a huge number of open positions, and students with practical knowledge and a thirst for learning, it’s no wonder placement rates are so high at many bootcamps. For us, over 90% of our students find industry work within three months of completing the course. Bootcamps also do a lot of work to build relationships with companies that are open to hiring junior developers and tailoring their programs to fit employers needs. This can help open doors that are otherwise very hard to find when you are learning on your own.<p><i>- The job openings are for multiple types of programming languages, but the people hired into these positions do not always have experience with those languages. Startups and larger companies are looking for a great cultural fit in combination with decent coding skills.</i><p>As I was saying above, many jobs that we are able to find for students are not posted online. Beyond simply opening doors, we work hard with our students to build networking skills and an understanding of the job market so that they also how to create job openings for themselves. Many companies are focused on finding someone they will want to be around long-term – employees who can integrate well into a fast-paced culture and who will be able to adapt to a changing tech stack. I think this is one big reason companies are willing to hire developers with a lower skill level or limited experience. Bootcamp students are really hungry to keep learning, a bootcamp is just the beginning of their coding career.",1420654998

They are greater, you say, than an officer&#x27;s chances of being shot by a white man, but is the risk objectively large? I think the answer to this is clearly no.<p>So while it might be rational for an officer to behave as though he is <i>more likely</i> to be shot, this is different from responding as though he is <i>likely</i> to be shot. Unfortunately, they are doing the latter entirely too often. Perhaps this is the result of natural cognitive biases (some combination of confirmation bias and negativity bias, maybe), amplified by the images we all see in the media. These are powerful forces that, I think, most of us struggle with. But that does not mean that cops, who are supposed to be highly trained professionals, entrusted with powerful weapons, and the preservation of public safety, do not have a duty to overcome these biases.<p>(I agree it&#x27;s not what you&#x27;ve called &quot;old-school racist.&quot; But it makes no difference.

6853,comment,6668,6668,0,0,annex_hipster,,,"Paul, your essays inspired me to quit my job even though I was looking forward to a nice promotion. A couple of years was enough. I'm two weeks into my startup, which I'm basing on a Paul Graham/Joel Spolsky hybrid model. I'm building up capital by taking on some small- to medium-sized projects while prototyping my real idea behind the scenes with a few collaborators.<p>While my work struggles to find my replacement, I have no problems finding people that A) want to work for me on contract projects, and B) want me to work on their projects (right now there is a queue). I actually work longer now than I did in the office. But I'm not tired. In fact, I have more energy. Additionally, if you normalize my work hours, I am even more productive working on my own. I just generally feel better about myself and am only experiencing ""good"" stress these days. I encourage anyone who finds themselves agreeing with Paul Graham in his essays more often than not to make the leap.<p>I fundamentally agree with Paul Graham about the change we are seeing. In fact, my little prototype bets the farm on the premise that this change is indeed happening.<p>I'm sufficiently capitalized having had a couple of years out of school to make some money that Y Combinator's funding is, quite frankly, an unattractive proposition. Plus, I'm in Toronto and I love the city. I live/work downtown right near the university. I would not want to move. All this said, is there any chance that you will do a talk up here in Canada?\n",1175063879

Problem is that Outlook's UI is not that great to begin with. All that clicking and dragging and split-pane views are so damn annoying and slow. <p>More here: <a href=""http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2006/12/18/why-splitpane-views-suck/"">http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2006/12/18/why-splitpane-views-suck/</a><p>Gmail has Y!

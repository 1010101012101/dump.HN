I also think he is wrong.<p>There is no ""true path"" of SV that it can fall off of and be over. Instead, there is a continued cycle of very technical people working together to build significant equity that is then recycled for more new tech people to do the same.<p>When that stops happening, SV will die. In the meantime (like any other time), there are sparkly things drawing people's attention. And I would be willing to wager the crop of people making big exits today aren't going to be happy investing everything in what they just did.",1337410789

Kiss You Inside Out is simultaneously romantic and seductive, which is perfect since Hedley seem to be speaking to new lovers with the lyrics, and these emotions of love and passion are very intense at the start of a fresh romance. Its is one of those soundtrack to your life songs, the kind that you want playing while youre running wild on a hot summer night.<p>It also helps that the entire composition is catchy as hell. We guarantee that after a couple listens, youll have the hook playing on repeat in your head: Turn off the lights / Take off your clothes/ Turn of the stereo / Give up the fight / Im in control / Yeah, I wanna know you inside out / Ill spend my life trying to figure out / Just close your eyes and shut your mouth / And let me kiss you inside out.<p>Be sure to stay tuned with Hedley, as their U.S. album release is on the brink of being announced. Head over to the bands official website and Twitter page for more updates on Hedley.",1337408023

3995219,comment,3992296,3994989,1,0,Mz,,,"The thing that most annoys me about the situation is that I am saving American tax payers potentially millions and cannot find a means to cover a few 10k in debts. I was a military wife for two decades. Although I am divorced, as long as I do not remarry, I am entitled to essentially free medical care through the military. But I have not seen a doctor in nearly six years and it feels like I am basically being punished for doing the right thing even though this did not just benefit me and my kids but is clearly significantly benefitting society. Further, being homeless and mired in trying to just survive is an active obstacle to trying to further develop my sites. American tax payers could benefit millions more if I could get backing/assistance.<p>I am not a ""charity case"" -- I.e. just a waste of money. I have something of significant value to offer the world but I need help to make it happen. Unfortunately, it looks and sounds like I am a charity case, simply because what I pulled off fell outside the paradigms currently in use and the assistance I need does not fit neatly into a VC/ startup investment type model.",1337407763

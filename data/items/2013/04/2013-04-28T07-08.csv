The fact that you have had few complaints may reflect the fact that people are courteous and do not like to get into arguments. I have very much liked to complain several times about e-cigarettes myself.<p>b- they almost certainly harm people around you although the harm may be less than that of secondary smoke.<p>c - your last argument obviously does not apply to the present situation. If you ban e-cigarettes in places where cigarettes are already banned, then this ban would not cause an e-cigarette smoker to start smoking ordinary cigarettes. In fact, the contrary is true -- if smokers can smoke e-cigarettes in places in situations where they cannot smoke ordinary cigarettes, that very well may result in an increase of smoking.<p>You can smoke your e-cigarettes in places and situations where cigarette smoking is allowed.",1367135796

You probably would not call it secondary smoke, but whatever is being vaporized by the e-cigarette gets exhaled by the user and then inhaled by other non-users in the area. I worked closely with an e-cigarette smoker once and I could definitely feel it.<p>E-cigarette proponents say that because e-cigarettes do not burn anything, they are safer than cigarettes. That is probably true, but safer does not mean safe. They are definitely not safe as the main substance they are intended to deliver -- nicotine -- is itself unsafe.<p>So until there are studies that show that there is no danger to others in the environment all smoking bans should apply to e-cigarettes.",1367135224

Auditing is a huge part of enterprise best practice; it should be best practice for consumers as well, and enterprises should help them with it.<p>2. That said, the number of sites for which we need really solid security is probably under 10. For me it's primary email, 3 for websites I own/hosting/etc., Paypal, bank, arguably Amazon, and not much else. And frankly I forget my bank password and have to keep resetting it (which is part of why my email needs to be secure).",1367132801

So I cut it and my friend would choose a half. After a couple times I realized that thanks to the fact that it's not humanly possible to cut it in half perfectly, the person choosing will always get the bigger half.

They needed a way to trigger certain things (sound recording, etc) when two certain people were in physical proximity. As it turns out, bluetooth bonjour discovery did the trick when they were in the same room. Over wifi, it got triggered sooner, once one of them enterred the building where the other one was (which corresponded to being on the same LAN).<p>The hard problem on iOS devices (iPod touch) was keeping them awake during this, so they could detect eac other. iOS likes to sleep while locked. Got a solution, which made the battery last around a day. I guess they're not using mobile to mobile peer triggers, but fixed-to-mobile and then deliver a notification. Interesting to see this popping up in commercial tech.<p>I was going to spin my code out into a infrastructure for spatial awareness triggers for various home automation tasks, but also couldn't find a killer use case. I'll be following this topic for ideas :)",1367132528

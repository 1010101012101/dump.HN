(Though I display the number of sales on the site, so if you go and add everything up you can figure all this out anyway.)<p>I recently found out about my first direct competitor, who it seems is knocking off other people's creations to sell and clearly got some ""inspiration"" (i.e., ripped me off) on how I do things on my end. Right down to copying HTML from my site. Needless to say it is discouraging, but it also forces you to hunker down to try and stay ahead of the competition.<p>I strongly urge others who are in a similar position to reconsider just how open they are. Especially with the people who will email you privately and ask for guidance in what they will usually tell you is something that in no way competes with what you're doing. There are indeed many sharks in the water.<p>I do think there's something to the whole 'brag about your success and more people will find out about you' thing.

Why would they risk a more delayed IPO (and their ability to cash out at such an overinflated valuation)?  In an IPO _now_ the risk of whether they can monetize falls to the public while stakeholders cash out on the basis of positive future speculation.  In a delayed IPO, the stakeholders assume the risk of being able to actually figure out a revenue generating alternative to the diminishing ad service before user growth flattens---if unable to---panic/skepticism would ensue and the company's valuation (and stakeholder investment) would decline.",1337867085

I think the 2 key failings of the checked exception idea (there are others, but not as important) are<p>1) Precise exception specifications leak implementation details. This will bite you badly, e.g., when you want to change the implementation from under a published API.<p>2) The times when we only care that some exception occurred <i>vastly outnumber</i> the times when we care about the exact types of exceptions that may occur. Checked exceptions don't add any value to the common case, in fact they make it worse, because generic exception handlers tend to live many levels up the call stack from where exceptions are thrown(1), and therefore they ""aggregate"" large amounts of code that that can collectively throw a huge range of exceptions. If you were to carry around detailed ""throws"" clauses, they would be a mile long.<p>The funny thing is, all solutions that solve the problems created by checked exceptions do so by subverting the mechanism one way or another. So you're better off without checked exceptions in the first place.<p>I've always been interested in this discussion because it's one of those cases where an idea seems very good on paper, only to turn out quite bad in practice.<p>(1) This observation is what makes exceptions such a useful mechanism in the first place.",1337865997

This is a government answer to a question posed by parliament, which means that it probably went through a lot of hands, most of which don't even know what PGP stands for, let alone what the technology does.<p>The statement itself is very vague anyway, saying that ""it depends on the strength and the quality of the encryption"". Which most likely translates to: they cannot actually break PGP, but they have some tricks to get key material via other means, and then obviously they can decrypt.",1337864541

Indeed, that's the likely explanation - if Germany really figured out how to decrypt best-practice PGP, they wouldn't be blabbing about it.<p>(Also note that the Subject: line is unencrypted by design.)",1337864445

And we need to acknowledge the reality that people does not behave as theory, law, or whatever other abstract term expects (the law is so abstract that it needs a punishment machinery to be respected, it is not natural at all, and while some people will surrender their free will to goverment compliance, others will not, not even under the threat of heavy legal pain). Not realising this fact of life is naive.<p>You can go around beating people over their head for their wrong doings (natural or artificial), and if that makes you feel better about yourself or your position then take your measuring stick and go on your merry way.<p>I, on the other camp, rather attempt to figure out how people actually works, and make decisions accordingly.<p>Try to understand how things work vs. Do a I say or I'll beat you up.

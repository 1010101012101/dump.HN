Hello, my name is Robert Mugabe.  I am the Leader of Zimbabwe.  My treasury has excess funds that we cannot currently use in Zimbabwe due to political circumstances.  I would like to see this money put to good use and you seem like a good person.  If you send me $50,000 in good faith, I will mail you 100 billion dollars within a month.

It isn't as simple as inserting some tables into a database - building this service will require collaboration between tech companies and music labels, something that happens slowly and dysfunctionally.<p>If you've ever worked in this space, you'll realize that everyone involved on both sides is either a coked out psychopath who is just at the meeting because his boss made him or a ""cool guy"" hacker who doesn't really believe in the service, since he already has a multi terabyte server in his closet filled with all the music he's ever liked leeched from oink or waffles. Neither really have any ""skin in the game.""

They have had a long history of patching their own libraries and their own SO to fix bugs in software like SimCity... yes, they put special-case custom code in their own software to fix bugs in other companies' software. It was all in the interest of backward compatibility.<p>It was also short-sighted; that's not a sustainable way to go forward, because every one of those custom patches increases the maintenance overhead of your code, and it's not already stellar quality code, you're going to be in trouble... and MS was the epitome of the sweatshop, so there's no way that they had much if any good code floating around there.<p>Lately however, the other side has been gaining ground, leading to things like dotNET. They've willingly sacrificed backward compatibility in so far limited ways, which is a start in the right direction, IMO.<p>Since this project is in MS Research, it has a shot, but I suspect that if it were part of the standard development process at MS, it would take 90+ years, based on the story of the guy that wrote the start menu for Vista...<p>I think you're right; no matter what they do with the brand, I agree about windows.

Please understand that while this might be a confrontational retort, it is in no way meant to be a flame.<p><i>A hobby is something you can actually get better at. Watching TV is not a hobby.</i><p>Actually, a hobby is defined as ""an activity or interest pursued for pleasure or relaxation and not as a main occupation"", so TV can be a hobby for some people. Also, people can get ""better"" at watching TV, by putting in more hours, watching multiple channels at once, larger screens etc...<p><i>A hobby is something to which you give sustained effort.</i><p>I dont believe that to be true, for example - I have one tabletop wargame on average every week, I'm a member of a club and it would take up maybe 3 hours of my total week?

261967,comment,261790,261896,0,0,jonmc12,,,"I think its a good analogy.  Oil and bandwidth are intrinsically very similar with regards to the risk / regulation dynamic in a commercial enterprise that builds private infrastructure to the masses.  Oil companies had to make large investments and take huge risks to explore, drill for oil, build a distribution system, etc.  Similarly, ATT, Comcast and Vodafone had to take risks to lay down the pipes for a robust communication infrastructure.  Bandwidth is not as scarce as, say, Oil, but still at any given time there is a limited amount, and an incremental cost associated with building infrastructure for more.<p>The problem in both scenarios is that there is an inherent conflict of interest when these bets pay off.  At the point where every single member of a society relies on a particular infrastructure to maintain quality of life, it suddenly becomes more important to make certain this infrastructure is available than for the company to make a large profit.<p>I thought this context was implicit in the article.  I think what the author is saying is, because of this dynamic, we the consumers need to be aware and take measures to protect our own self-interest as this dynamic plays out once again (so ATT does not become the cash machine that Exxon is.. at our expense).  The ""oil addiction"" analogy sort of dumbs this down, but that's cool with me because as a result the author is reaching a larger audience that more cerebral arguments could not touch.",1217434825

261955,comment,261483,261844,0,0,jlc,,,"Novelists (and short story writers) who publish a first book in their twenties are perceived as wunderkinder.  It is considered much more usual to begin publishing books in your thirties.  I'm basing this on my experience as a keen reader of ""literary"" fiction and as a fiction writer (with a handful of pubs, but no book, dammit).  And no, if I published one today, I wouldn't be considered a wunderkinder ;-)<p>Now, I'm pretty confident in my assertion that this is the general perception, but I haven't compiled the facts to see whether perception coincides with reality.  Certainly, I can think of many young first novelists from over the years:  Michael Chabon, Philip Roth, Zadie Smith, Bret Easton Ellis, David Foster Wallace.  Yes, Neal Stephenson, you hackers, you.  But if you check out the press and reviews on their first books, you'll find that almost the most salient fact about them is their age.<p>Assuming most first fiction books are published in the writer's early thirties, why would that be?  Writing fiction requires a lot of disparate skills.  It takes a long time to develop them, and they tend to develop asynchronously.  The typical case, is a young writer with the technical skills, but not enough life experience to really get inside anyone's head, which is necessary in fiction, of course.  (Certainly, it sometimes works the other way around.)  Some young writers are so good at the technical aspects that the reader is willing to look past shallowness of characters, a tired theme, etc.  And their books are published despite flaws.  I'd say this is the case with Zadie Smith's _White Teeth_ for instance.<p>And of course (he says cynically) sometimes books are published for reasons other than their quality.<p>Murakami, BTW, has all but disavowed his first two novels.",1217434177

People are trained to sign-up. It might make sense to change your front page to include a ""Sign up now"" button that just is a mailto:link or something similar. Maybe with a subject of ""No signup is necessary! Just start sending email to posterous and you win.""<p>Who knows-- just some feedback that I often have to talk people through the initial posterous process.",1217433627

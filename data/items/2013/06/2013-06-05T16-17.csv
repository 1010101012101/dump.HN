Fine, whatever 37S's expectations were to begin with didn't work out, so 37S is closing the service. Makes perfect sense, and godspeed, 37S. But the other side of a transaction is a customer that put money, time and effort into this product. Even if 37S gives back the money, the customer isn't made completely whole; I don't think it's illogical to think folks wouldn't be completely happy with this outcome, no matter how great of a job 37S did communicating the closing.",1370451547

I also know some people who work in this industry that only possess college level qualifications and earn more than me, but are certainly less effective, less knowledgeable and more narrow-minded. I am not by any means suggesting that all people who possess degree level qualifications are better than those who do not, or that they should earn more.

One is as the function from a ring of square matrices to the underlying field (e.g. from R^(n^2) -> R) that sends identity to identity, is alternating (swapping two rows or columns negates the function) and is multilinear (is a linear function in each of the columns independently). These properties are all useful and important on their own, so there is motivation to study a function which has all of them. It's not obvious that such a function exists, but you can prove that. As it turns out, these three properties uniquely determine such a function, which makes it seem like that function might be really important!<p>There's a more general definition too, which is based around the wedge product, a quintessential object in algebra and calculus.

Locality is desirable but is not and has never been the only thing that matters.</i><p>If you haven't actually looked at the block allocation patterns of common filesystems, then you can't say conclusively that fuzzbang is incorrect.  Arguments from first principles (e.g. ""basic physics"") cannot override empirical evidence.<p>Further, locality of reference will have a <i>much, much</i> bigger influence on spinning disk I/O throughput than location at the front of the disk.  The difference between the outer rim and inner rim might be 120MB/s to 70MB/s, so reading a contiguous 200MB file will take 1.7x as long if it's stored at the inner rim (286ms vs 167ms).  However, if that 200MB file is stored in 100 2MB fragments, and seeking to each fragment takes 4ms, your reading time will be dominated by the seek time due to fragmentation (686ms vs 567ms, or a mere 1.2x difference).<p>Based on my experience I'm inclined to accept fuzzbang's description of block allocation strategies.  It used to be common wisdom that you could defragment a volume by copying all the data off, formatting it, then copying the data back on.  I did this once with an NTFS volume (using ntfs-3g), then checked the resulting data in the Windows disk defragmenter.  The data was primarily located around the center of the volume, with numerous gaps.  Filesystems leave gaps to allow room for files to expand.<p><i>B) You have just named three uncommon filesystems that few people will ever use in the first place, much less with TrueCrypt.</i><p>""Commonness"" for the purposes of forensics is a much lower bar than for market analysis.

My roommate started a little over a month before me, and refuses to put money into the game.<p>The amount of time to invest into buildings/resources/farming scales up with how progressed your town is, and gems are present to alleviate this strain. The implication that gems are necessary to win are unfound.<p>The game follows a simple town building principle, use currencies (gold / elixir) to build/upgrade buildings, however you can only upgrade them to the limit your town hall level will allow. The way to gain currency is attack other towns (to steal their resources), or use gems. Even if you use gems to upgrade your things, you are simply progressing further in the game, at the risk of opening yourself up to more powerful enemies. When you attack weaker enemies, there are diminishing returns (look up the loot multiplier). So while gems allow you to progress, you must also adapt and attack higher level towns. These higher level towns can be achieved without any monetary investment in the game. Gems just allow you to reach that stage sooner.<p>I bought gems in the beginning, because the game uses a builder mechanic to limit how many buildings you can build/upgrade at one time. When you start out, you have 2 for free. You can have a maximum of 5, however these are bought with gems and the cost increases each time you buy one. With $10, I soon had 4 builders. With this, I was able to progress much faster than my roommate. I am catching up to his level quickly, almost at where he was in two months time with one month invested.<p>Additionally, gems can be attained for free by clearing brush, however it will be a nominal amount versus buying them outright. But to say gems are required to win this game is not true, but it does save you time versus waiting around a week for a building upgrade to finish. The main thing most people need to realize is this game isn't about spending money, but investing more time into it. The game is a continual uphill grind where the true currency is how much time you devote to it, but I'm still having fun with it for now.",1370450559

Players don't have ""decks"", they all share the same deck of cards. Basically, it plays like chess, all players are equal. So, there's no room for in-game economy between players.<p>Currently I'm considering the following models:<p>1. pay for some additional units (cards) which would basically mean that some players who pay have additional strategies available (not necessarily more powerful, but rather more diverse).<p>2. pay to play more. Amount of duels per day would be limited, and thus the player's progress. The game will feature a ranking system with levels, so paying players could advance faster.<p>The second one seems closer to KoL model. Which now gives me an idea. I could separate the rankings system (leaderboard) from the player leveling system, so that leaderboard is limited to, say, first 5 matches each day, while you could still play additional duels to level-up faster. Although, leveling-up has no effect on the gameplay, it's purely cosmetic.<p>I'm still not sure if 1. or 2. would make more money, but making more money is not my primary concern.

It is likely that new families could not form until the parents of the potential couple were either dead or old enough to retire, so that they could turn over their land and dwelling to the new couple.""</i> [Linda Mitchell, Family Life in the Middle Ages, Greenwood 2007, p. 40]<p><i>""Reliable statistics are rare for the Middle Ages, but the evidence suggests that the typical age of marriage among the peasantry was the late twenties for men, the early twenties for women; similar ages probably applied for the urban laboring classes. The ages decline, particularly for women, further up the social scale. Among prosperous urban families, the marriage age for women was typically the late teens; the age varied widely for men. In the aristocracy, ages in the mid-teens for women and early twenties for men seem to have been common.""</i> [Jeffrey L. Forgeng, Daily Life in Medieval Europe, Greenwood 1999, p. 27]<p>[The following text is concerned with the very beginning of Early Modern period-post Late Middle Ages] <i>""When individual ages are looked at, however, we do find very occasional marriages in the early teens. One girl gave her age as thirteen, none as fourteen, four as fifteen, twelve as sixteen, but all the rest of the brides in the sample, 990 of them, were seventeen or over, and more than four out of five had reached the age of twenty. Only ten of the men were younger than this. The commonest age for women was twenty-two, for men twenty-four; the median - the age below which as many got married as above it - was some 22.75 for women, 25.5 for men.""</i> [Peter Laslett, The World We Have Lost: Further Explored, Routledge 2001, p. 83]",1370449931

Though there are psychological norms people tend to stick to).<p>2) The founders have been working on the company for a while and incorporated well before taking investment. This is the scenario you describe. I added a 2nd sheet (""scenario 2"") to cover this case.<p>As you can see it also contains no circular references.<p>As you said price per share is no longer arbitrary here as it's fixed by the # of founder shares created pre-funding. Sometimes you might do a split (or reverse split) here to adjust the price per share to the same psychological norms as above.",1370449561

Honda started by selling piston rings to Toyota, and from there started manufacturing car part after car part until they had enough to create the cars themselves.  (And it turned out that when you can manufacture a car yourself from start to finish, you can manufacture a lot of other stuff with the same goods, from drills to radios).<p>On the other end of the spectrum, General Electric expanded by maintaining otherwise orthogonal SBUs and becoming one of the first companies in the 20th century to really take advantage of cross-branding, figuring out that if a customer liked their lightbulb they'd be okay with using the same company to buy a handheld radio.<p>(Incidentally, both GE and Honda also profited tremendously from WWII.

It says that ""out-tracking"", the fact that you steer the wheel out from under the bike, is more important than than gyroscopic precession. For motorcycles on highway speeds, I think this is incorrect. If you've ridden a motorcycle at high speed, you know that the handlebars are basically like buried in solid concrete. With normal steering force, I don't think I deflect the handlebars by anything noticeable. The key is that at high speed, the mere application of <i>torque</i> on a spinning wheel, will make it precess, ie turn around the orthogonal axis.

One of the perennial topics of the mid to late 90s was the idea that Perl needed major fixes to remove common pitfalls (e.g. the object model, syntax warts (nested structures are just horrid), etc) and be more suitable for large projects.<p>Years passed.<p>Perl 6 was talked about.<p>Years passed.<p>Nothing happened. People gave up and moved on. The same thing's happened to PHP - years of broken things not being fixed eventually causes people to distrust the language's future and prevented it from moving into new niches.<p>Lisp is more complex, with far more redeeming features, but by now it shares the same failed-promise challenge: I've been writing software for a couple decades, so I missed out on the early history of Lisp, but for most of that time I've kept hearing about how great it is and how it'll soon be as productive as the inferior languages people actually use to get work done - and that point's always been in the future, never the present.

While I also run my own small business I'm looking for secondary employment offer a wide range of skills and experience. I was interviewed last week for a position I'd be really interested in with flexible part-time hours (bonus for the already self-employed). The only catch is I would offer them more than they bargained for, but I don't perfectly fit all the skills they are looking for. I would be capable of doing the job required and more, but I don't bear the corresponding position title on my resume.

No more e-commerce hassles like a merchant account or payment gateway.<p>The anonymity is less strong than many initially presume since ALL PAYMENTS ARE PUBLICLY REGISTERED, including the payment chain. This is why it's important to generate a new btc receiving address whenever you perform a new transaction. The entire exchange history of that bitcoin is public knowledge, from the day it was generated until the very last transaction. Hence, if you use a bitcoin that was sent to a publicly disclosed address to pay for something, that transaction is linked to you forever. So people need to be careful about how they use which bitcoins, and the client doesn't really make that easy.<p>There really is a lot of potential in btc, I've been excited about it since I first learned of it, though as soon as the government catches on they will outlaw it (if they can't find a current law to justify prosecution and/or destruction of the btc network, which is doubtful) and do everything possible to destroy it. They won't like it at all, and neither will the banks that even btc users rely on to store their country's regularly denominated currency.

2454855,comment,2450700,2451551,1,0,ejames,,,"There's basically three categories where this problem shows up: grade inflation, cheating, and discipline.  Grade inflation is most relevant to colleges, discipline only matters for levels of schooling with mandatory attendance, and cheating cuts across all levels.<p>However, the same issue is in common: In theory, there are standards applied to students, and it is an important priority to distinguish between students who meet the standards and students who don't.  In practice, the administration does not necessarily care about applying the standards rigorously.<p>I think the following two articles are a good introduction to grade inflation as a topic:<p>""Can Untenured Faculty Members Stop Grade Inflation?"" - Chronicle of Higher Education, <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Can-Untenured-Faculty-Members/45518/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/Can-Untenured-Faculty-Members/4...</a><p>""In the Basement of the Ivory Tower"" - The Atlantic Monthly, <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower/6810/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/in-the-b...</a><p>It can also be useful to read up on business schools, because a business major is not an ""academic"" subject; more than any other major, the students are looking explicitly for a credential that boosts their income, and don't care about the subject material.  The book ""Ahead of the Curve"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ahead-Curve-Harvard-Business-School/dp/B001RNOPLY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1302987751&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ahead-Curve-Harvard-Business-School/dp...</a>) is a well-written appraisal of the Harvard B-School and includes chapters specifically on both grade inflation and cheating.<p>Going through these publications and/or following the notes and recommended reading therein can lead to more involved reading on the topic.  Articles in the Atlantic Monthly are always a good starting point.<p>The fundamental issue:  If an institution of learning punishes students for cheating, or failing classes, or behaving badly, then somebody, somewhere must have both the authority to do so and the goal of exercising said authority.  But often, nobody wants to be that person, or the authority is conflicted, or the goal is given less priority than the goal of making money/quota.",1302988507

It's for toddlers to learn to take turns, to accept negative or positive outcomes without stomping off in a huff, and to play a game with a level playing field between the adults and children... and at the level we are talking about, if there is a meaningful choice <i>at all</i>, then the child, or perhaps rather <i>toddler</i>, will simply lose. It's more than just ""following directions"", it's the whole set of skills necessary to play a game.<p>This is why family games have a gradient to them, gradually trading chances for decisions, and gradually expanding the state space, until the game player is ready to join the adults fully with something like Scrabble in the early teens or so. The mentioned Connect 4, for instance, is relatively simple and can be effectively ""solved"" by an 8 or 9 year old, for instance, so a 8yo and an adult are still not separated by such a large gulf that the game is a joke. Children are actually pretty good at figuring out that they are being ""let"" win.<p>If you replace Candyland with something that has any choices at all, you've replaced something other than Candyland.<p>That said, I'm not saying the progression is optimal as it stands, but if you don't understand the reasons for the enduring popularity of the ""standard game loadout"", which hasn't seem to have hardly changed in 50 years, you're not going to improve on it properly.

- When adding a feed, include feed detection code, so that I can type in a URL and have the feed auto-detected, instead of having to find the exact feed URL
- Allow a threshold for downmodding like HN... only submitters with X or more karma can downmod.<p>This looks great and I look forward to seeing it evolve and get better!",1216094292

246354,comment,246279,246279,0,0,iamwil,,,"I've had the inclination to do this sort of thing, but the more hardware you have, the more likely, you'll have a component on some machine that will fail.  As one person, you might end up spending all your time replacing or throwing away broken parts to keep the cluster up.<p>The other this is to pay for the electricity of a couple boxes running, regardless of how slow they are at a larger scale.<p>This sort of thing is good as a learning experience, imo, but if one's hoping to scale it up expect to run into lots of infrastructure problems one has to solve.",1216093771

If there were chance introduced at key points in the game (like drawing cards or flipping coins) I don't think anyone would watch baseball, football, or soccer.<p>Also, board games involving skill (e.g. chess and go) have stood the test of time over many chance games.",1216093657

246340,comment,188489,188489,0,0,tedward,,,"It might help to substitute ""ignorance"" instead of ""innocence"" in your essay. To be innocent primarily means to 'do no harm' not ""to be ignorant"" of the truth. 
I think many parents keep their kids ignorant (of evil) because they think it will help keep them innocent (free of the sin of committing evil). As you imply, for a time, this seems right, but eventually you need controlled exposure to toxins (ethical, etc.) to learn how to protect your self.",1216091914

It's a handy alternative to ""scp"" when you don't want to open a second connection to grovel through ""find"" on the target system, but it's even less firewall-friendly than FTP: you can't enable users to grab files with SFTP without <i>also</i> enabling them to SSH to remote hosts.<p>Most enterprises <i>don't</i> allow outbound SSH through their firewalls, in part because SSH is its own slippery slope: if you're allowing SSH, you're allowing people to build VPN tunnels.<p>The real-world operational problem that FTP solves is upload. There is no download application that HTTP doesn't solve better than FTP. If Apache shipped with a mod_upload with a reasonable configuration system and a simple, workable web interface for specifying what to put where, FTP could be laid to rest.",1216091824

However, neither is usually going to be the best solution.<p>What is implied is that RDBMS have inherent complications not due to volumes of data, but rather due to to complexities of using them (both from a sys admin, and developer point of view) particularly when HA is required.<p>I, for one, look forward to a more loosely typed flexible persistence layer than RDBMS however it may come.<p>BTW: Any form of data persistence is an alternative to an RDBMS!?",1216091606

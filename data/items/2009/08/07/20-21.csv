First you would have to compare to other markets you could develop software in.  You have to factor the entrenchment of market leaders in those segments, and also how each of the relative markets are growing or shrinking.  Finally--and this is the thing that is keeping me out of iPhone development--you have to factor in the risks of developing on a closed platform with strict and arbitrary entrance requirements and how those things may change in the future.<p>Both Apple and Facebook have the ability to rip the floor right out from under your profitable app.  Personally I think they are both great platforms, but I would not limit myself to them unless I was just trying to do a quick flip.  In terms of long term value I would want those apps to be tied to some valuable backend service or open web technology that would not completely kill the business if Apple decides to kill my app.",1249678769

Systemic risks are very much existent.<p>And if banks and financial institutions are going to cry for federal bailouts every time a ""systemic risk"" rears its ugly head, the only thing any responsible government official can do is put in regulation to make sure that the systemic risks are controlled.<p>The financial industry loves to complain about regulation but it is the financial industry that brought this on their own heads by (1) fuckign up, and (2) asking the taxpayer to pay for their fuckup.<p>As far as the rationale, it is different from what you said. The rationale is that certain parts of the economy are so intertwined that if one financial company craters it can cause a chain reaction disaster for multiple other completely healthy financial institutions. I am not sure I buy this logic, but again the financial industry used this very same logic to say it was not their fault when the economy imploded, so it is only fair that the same thinking should be applied to them now that the feds are starting to regulate them.<p>Now you could make somewhat of an argument that VCs are not systemic risks, and that may be true if they were mostly owned by wealthy individuals, but that's not the case. VCs are mostly owned by financial institutions that may borrow against their property, so if the value of a VC craters they may cause a sell off spiral in a larger financial institution. Again, I am not I believe the above sentence, but if you buy into the theory of systemic risks, it is pretty obvious that VCs are one.",1249677782

If the US can continue to accelerate innovation, being the biggest medical innovator in the world, costs for older technologies will also fall improving access.  Restrict what technology companies and healthcare firms who use these technologies can charge however, and you reduce the incentive to innovate.

I really don't know whether the interviewer wants the autistic-but-informative answer or the quick of-course-I-know answer. Trying to guess what sort of answer you are seeking induces mild panic in me: I don't know you, but if your response in an interview was 'what a crap algorithm' I'd be thinking 'this guy is a bit Machiavellian...'.<p>I mean, I can think of a much faster way (than this) to get a given term in the fibonacci series using a loop, but this one recurses, which was <i>what was requested</i> - I had to quickly choose a problem domain in which to demonstrate it.

And what Mr. Kamen argues is that the income generated by those expensive procedures -- not to mention a segment of the population that is willing to pay for it -- is what will lead to the breakthroughs in the future that will make (say) kidney transplants unnecessary in another generation.<p>What really concerns me is that I know, because I have Crohn's Disease, that I have a much higher risk of colon cancer. Even at forty years old, I'm trying to put myself into a position where I'll be able to deal with that should it happen.<p>But in the ultimate socialized/rationed model, I'm not <i>allowed</i> to buy myself additional treatment beyond the lowest common denominator. Canada recently fought (and lost, thank %deity%) to prevent citizens from getting better health insurance than the socialist plan. In England and other places you're allowed to get better care, but only if you pay for every bit of it -- you can't take the baseline and then pay for the overage. So that's definitely the direction that ""progress"" is moving in.<p>My biggest objection is that this prevents people from having their own values. I'm not to be allowed to make decisions that balance for or against my lifespan. I can only get the mix that the regulators have deemed appropriate for every person, one size fits all.",1249675384

Basically they lost situational awareness and got behind the plane: they didn&#x27;t understand what is going on with the plane systems (autopilot) and failed to &quot;fly the plane&quot;. While the NTSB report doesn&#x27;t state this, I would not be surprised to learn that they actually didn&#x27;t look outside of the window and instead they were head down punching buttons to reprogram the system.

Typically, the goal of the acquiring company is to make the startup an &quot;honors&#x27; college&quot; that evolves into an R&D lab. Staples Innovation Lab is one example that&#x27;s highly visible in the Clojure community.<p>This can be politically messy because it leaves open questions about extension of corporate policies (do people used to having 5+ weeks of vacation end up on 3? how do transfers work?) and division of labor, but I think it&#x27;s a good thing that&#x27;s generally done with the right intentions.<p>Ultimately, large companies have finally realized that the best way to get top talent is to revive R&D. If you don&#x27;t have the R&D culture that top talent demands, you get eaten by software instead of participating in the eating. One could just pay people more, but the costs of this are exponential (20-30% raises each year to keep people happy, as opposed to 5-10% when they enjoy their work) and only finance can afford that for senior people.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see it. The honors colleges, as they become more numerous, are going to provide young talent with much better places to start their careers than VC-funded startups or traditional large companies. I think we&#x27;ll see it become possible again for the entry-level programmer to have a solid 5-year start with increasing scope of responsibility, instead of having to job hop and play politics to get real projects in the way that most of us did when we were at that point.

They are usually used when visibility is less than 600 meters RVR and/or in adverse weather conditions, although limitations do apply for most aircraft—for example, for a Boeing 747-400 the limitations are a maximum headwind of 25 kts, a maximum tailwind of 10 kts, a maximum crosswind component of 25 kts, and a maximum crosswind with one engine inoperative of five knots. They may also include automatic braking to a full stop once the aircraft is on the ground, in conjunction with the autobrake system, and sometimes auto deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers.&quot;<p>&quot;Autoland requires the use of a radar altimeter to determine the aircraft&#x27;s height above the ground very precisely so as to initiate the landing flare at the correct height (usually about 50 feet (15 m)). The localizer signal of the ILS may be used for lateral control even after touchdown until the pilot disengages the autopilot. For safety reasons, once autoland is engaged and the ILS signals have been acquired by the autoland system, it will proceed to landing without further intervention, and can be disengaged only by completely disconnecting the autopilot (this prevents accidental disengagement of the autoland system at a critical moment). At least two and often three independent autopilot systems work in concert to carry out autoland, thus providing redundant protection against failures. Most autoland systems can operate with a single autopilot in an emergency, but they are only certified when multiple autopilots are available.&quot;<p>&quot;Autoland is highly accurate. In his 1959 paper [2] John Charnley, then Superintendent of the UK Royal Aircraft Establishment&#x27;s Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU), concluded a discussion of statistical results by saying that &quot;It is fair to claim, therefore, that not only will the automatic system land the aircraft when the weather prevents the human pilot, it also performs the operation much more precisely&quot;.&quot;",1387077731

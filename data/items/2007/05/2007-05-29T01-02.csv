The site can demand a higher CPM than Myspace (thanks to the higher quality of its pageviews and its more attractive demographics); the company employs only 85 developers; the user base constantly replenishes itself as new students join pre-existing networks; older users are increasingly comfortable connecting through the site as an alternative to LinkedIn; the international markets leave room for growth. I expect Facebook to go public.",1180403629

While I think the LINA announcement is interesting, I'm not really seeing how it affects me as a Windows user or software developer ...'</i><p>Don't be fooled or distracted by this announcement. I had a look at the developers ~ <a href=""http://openlina.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openlina.com</a> as of now there is no code, demos, examples or things you can consider technical.<p>The biggest problem I have with the crux of the article is it introduces a layer of complexity installing applications to desktops for something that as of the moment people are not screaming out for, <i>off-line saving</i> and <i>desktop applications</i>.<p>Do you want to go back as developers to using the MS toolset (<i>lets face it your going to have to use it to save time OR hobble an open source development environment plus installation tools</i>) AND have all the hassles of installation, support and development of desktop development?<p>I think evolution via speed of development will kill off this approach into something we cannot yet see. Maybe someone has already started?",1180400758

One entrepreneur won over by the Founders Fund's philosophy is Barney Pell, the 38-year-old founder of Powerset, a natural-language search-engine startup that harbors ambitions of challenging Google ...""</i><p>I wonder how well <i>'Clarium Capital Management'</i> are advising their funded companies. Powerset is really setting themselves up for a fall if their search results are a magnitude worse than google. They have made some mistakes that I can think of so far:<p>- they are <i>'talking'</i> about their instead of <i>'showing'</i> their product<p>- talking about technology (nlp) instead of about how it makes search easier, better for users<p>- licensing their <i>'core'</i> technology from PARC, Xerox & not investing in their own ~ <a href=""http://www.powerset.com/press/parc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerset.com/press/parc</a><p><i>""...

A bunch of hype probably inspires you to deliver a little more, but beyond that it seems pretty risky ...'</i><p>Maybe they don't want to release because they know how much <i>more</i> they have to work on it. So far the biggest thing I don't see yet is a feedback mechanism ie: usage. Do they do have a beta program that someone has signed up & used?<p>Spock could also learn from this. My favourite feature in spock is <i>""add an acquaintance""</i> If you select a name (any name because there is bound to be others with the same name) and they don't have a photo, your forced to add by name alone. 9/10 times it's the wrong one. I've given up for the moment.  This would have been picked up in a simple 5 minute test by a novice user to add people you know.<p>I wonder if powerset will make the similiar mistakes?",1182492902

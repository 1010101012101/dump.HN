I admit this is only anecdotal.<p>A fairly large percentage of those students (who are not already US citizens) will try to find work here and contribute to the US economy if they can. However due to the increasingly difficult immigration climate many of them will return home and become the spearhead of innovation for their home countries.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that is the same in the US undergraduate programs.<p>In net, you have two factors here,
1. Fewer US based students are going into graduate STEM programs.
2. More US educated foreign STEM graduate students are being trained to contribute to your future competitors.<p>I wonder what that does that to the long term prospects for home grown innovation in the US.<p>Just citing one study [1] below. I am sure there are even more counter studies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geography-of-foreign-students#/M10420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geograph...</a>",1443311955

10284846,comment,10283582,10283582,0,0,shoo,,,"First up: Microsoft is doing something progressive here, even if it is only a little step in the right direction, so they should be commended for it.<p>That said, the article (annoyingly) doesn&#x27;t give any information to help the reader decide if this is a meaningful improvement or not. Neither does microsoft&#x27;s &quot;carbon fee impact&quot; report [1].<p>Here&#x27;s a crude estimate by looking at the financials from microsoft&#x27;s 2014 annual report [2]:<p><pre><code>    revenue:		87b
    income tax:		6b
    salaries:		30b	(my crude guess)
    other expenses:	30b	(my crude guess)
    profit:		22b

</code></pre>
To sort-of-emulate the GDP calculation, let&#x27;s combine profit and salaries into one USD$52b bucket. Let&#x27;s round it to USD$50b / year.<p>The carbon intensity of the US economy is somewhere between 0.4 and 0.3 kg CO2 / USD$. Let&#x27;s say it is 0.35 kg CO2 / USD$ [3].<p>Based upon these figures, assuming that microsoft is a &quot;typical&quot; subset of the entire US economy (almost certainly not true, but we have no data otherwise), we might expect it to be responsible for an emissions footprint of USD$50b / year * 0.35 kg CO2 / USD$ = 17.5 * 10^6 tons CO2 / yr.<p>Back to the article. The article mentions the figure of a reduction of &quot;7.5 million metric tons of CO2&quot;. Note that this isn&#x27;t a reduction per year, I believe it is a estimate of lifetime net reduction in CO2 emissions due to the long-term projects they&#x27;ve funded both internally and externally.<p>So, now we&#x27;re in a position to claim (very crudely) something like: assuming microsoft has a typical carbon intensity for subset of the US economy, the profit and salaries claimed by microsoft in 2014 indicate that microsoft is responsible for something like 17.5 million metric tons of CO2 / yr. So, in a single year, we expect them to produce more than twice as much CO2 pollution as the total projected lifetime impact of their environmental projects to date.<p>That said, it is great that they are doing this! They should merely do more of it! So should other companies and countries!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/working-responsibly/principled-business-practices/environmental-sustainability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/wo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar14/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar14/index.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Friedlingstein_2014_Persistent%20growth%20of%20CO2%20emissions%20and%20implications%20for%20reaching%20climate%20targets.NatureG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Friedlingstein...</a>",1443311010

10284805,comment,10283990,10284184,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Japanese is a really nice language.  The grammar for plain speech is so consistent that I&#x27;m always tempted to try to write it down in BNF.  The other nice thing about it is that it is economical.  A noun by itself is a grammatically correct sentence.  Copula and verbs are optional.  Any sentence ending in a verb (or copula, as long as you change &quot;da&quot; to &quot;na&quot;) can be used to modify a noun.  It makes it so simple to say complex things.  Finally, things that you would use tone of voice for in English can be expressed with particles at the end of the sentence.  This allows you to be really expressive in Japanese.<p>If anyone is interested in learning Japanese, I have some advice:<p>- Do not learn polite forms until you master plain forms.  Japanese is built on plain forms and polite forms are an extension of that.  If you learn polite forms first, you are going to get wildly confused because everything you assume about the grammar will be wrong.  People think they must learn polite forms in order to get along.  Just do what all my Japanese high school students did: add &quot;desu&quot; to the end of all your sentences ;-).  It is totally wrong and you will sound like an uneducated, hillbilly moron, but people will appreciate your effort ;-)<p>- Read <a href=""http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar</a> I don&#x27;t think there is a better grammar guide out there.  Memorize all the example sentences (if you use flash cards or Anki, then drill from English to Japanese only).<p>- Learn hiragana and kanji (hiragana first).  Pick up katakana over time (it&#x27;s not really very important).  Hiragana and katakana are phonetic alphabets.  Once you know hiragana you can read children&#x27;s books with &quot;furigana&quot; (the pronunciation of kanji is written beside the kanji in hiragana).  Kanji are the chinese characters.<p>- Do not avoid learning kanji.  One thing that I discovered as I was learning Japanese is that I could learn vocabulary along with the kanji faster than I could learn the vocabulary alone.  Kanji is a fantastic mnemonic and is constructed in a comprehensible way.  &quot;Remembering the kanji&quot; by James Heisig is a great technique for learning kanji.  I don&#x27;t like his choice of keywords, though (some are arguably just wrong).  I recommend reading the first section of the book and then deriving your own keywords.  As it turns out, the publisher of the book offers the first section as a free PDF download: <a href=""http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/en/files/2012/12/RK-1-6th-edition-sample.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/en/files/2012/12/RK-1-6th-edition...</a><p>- Read manga as a way to learn conversational Japanese.  Probably this is the best thing I ever did.  Yes there are characters with weird expressions (datte ba yo!) or incredibly impolite expressions (ending every sentence with yagaru), but I <i>really</i> doubt you will fail to pick those up ;-)  Obviously don&#x27;t use them in real conversations if you don&#x27;t want to shock people.  Generally speaking the expressions -- and especially the contractions -- are the way normal people speak in Japan.  You won&#x27;t get this in a text book.<p>- Don&#x27;t read textbooks (except for Tae Kim&#x27;s, linked above).<p>- For introductory vocabulary, the JLPT vocabulary lists up to and including N3 are excellent.  Don&#x27;t bother past there because it is loaded down with vocabulary that you are unlikely to use, at the expense of vocabulary that you will definitely need in every day conversations.  After you memorize N3 vocabulary, just get all your vocabulary from normal reading.  By all means, if you just enjoy memorizing vocabulary lists, feel free to do N2 and N1 vocabulary lists -- it won&#x27;t hurt you.  I just think that it is an inefficient use of time.<p>Hope that helps anyone who is getting started ;-)",1443309663

This man was acquitted due to video, so let&#x27;s put video on every police officer. Toronto for example is playing with this, and it makes financial sense. They have about 5.000 police officers on a police department budget of $1.7 billion. We all know how cheap cameras (just look at the cameras on $50 smartphones) and storage have become in recent years, with a per officer budget of about $350k, spending a few thousand a year (much more than you&#x27;d need for a solid camera & storage system) on cameras would constitute a 1% cost increase, and you can probably offset that cost immediately due to cost savings in faster trials due to less ambiguous evidence, fewer complaints, less use of force etc (for example we&#x27;ve seen in recent months reports of 70% fewer citizen complaints, 30% drop in use of force incidents in Birmingham). Chicago for example spent $500m over 10 years on police abuse cases (obviously paid for by citizens, not the police officers in question themselves)<p>Second is to stop the bs &#x27;internal investigation&#x27;. Police officers aren&#x27;t diplomats, they&#x27;re citizens on duty as civil servants, when they&#x27;re suspected of harming the civilians they&#x27;re supposed to serve, why have them be investigated by their colleagues and close peers? I mean it&#x27;s ridiculous. This is so terrible because we see the old 80/20 rule in police departments, too, I don&#x27;t know the exact statistics from the top of my head but the notion that 80% of the complaints and incidents are caused by 20% of the police officers isn&#x27;t far from the actual number. A ton of honest and awesome cops go their entire career without any abuse of power, you can&#x27;t prevent the others from getting in, but you can make sure they get out once you catch them. Donald Sadowy for example has been accused of excessive force 10 times in 2 years in actual lawsuits, imagine how many times he must&#x27;ve used excessive force if he was taken to court 10 times, yet he&#x27;s still on the force. If you actually run the same 3 strikes and you&#x27;re permanently fired policy on abuse that you do on citizens smoking some harmless pot who go to jail for years, and have officers investigated by an independent court with bodycam evidence, you&#x27;d probably already cut out a lot of abuse from guys like these, let alone if you fire people after one incident and even send people to jail for abuse of power. Beyond that, getting fired should mean losing the ability to be a police officer, period, nationwide. A lawyer for example can lose his license nationwide in most countries, but police officers too often leave one department and simply join another.",1443309644

Before the adoption of that technology, the machine employed for the same purpose was the bailiff&#x27;s firearm.<p>It would be unthinkable for a judge to order the bailiff to shoot a defendant for refusing to stand up while addressing the court. But this judge apparently deemed it acceptable to torture the defendant by administering a five-second electric shock that made him writhe and scream in front of the jury.<p>The judge&#x27;s behavior was a gross abuse of power, and I&#x27;m not saying we should eliminate this technology. Electroshock belts seem valuable for a number of reasons, including the fact that they allow fewer defendants to be tried in full restraints, which may prejudice jurors.<p>Nevertheless, the entire sequence of events offers a chilling case study about the unintended side effects of decreasing the negative consequences that result from using force.",1443308734

This is the example being given for the kind of client code that SyncNinja would enable:<p><pre><code>    someDatabase.lookup(&#x27;users&#x27;, &#x27;john&#x27;, function (err, userData) {
        console.log(&quot;User&#x27;s real name is &quot; + userData.userName);
    });
</code></pre>
This is already possible to do on the client-side, in plain JS, and any kind of server, as a very, very thin wrapper around the available AJAX calls provided by the server web API.<p>So my point is, I see no convincing examples of SyncNinja making something possible that wasn&#x27;t already trivial before, and without the big overhead. Maybe you guys should work on what the value of this system is in practice.<p>Your &quot;before&quot; example doesn&#x27;t show limitations of the browser, but simply a missing thin client library to abstract the AJAX calls.<p>Additionally, you have no prototype of this concept at all. Even a toy prototype with just one kind of event, or something. It sends the message that everything written in the paper doesn&#x27;t come from experience, but it&#x27;s merely hypothetical. And there&#x27;s a giant leap from an idea to a working prototype.",1443308602

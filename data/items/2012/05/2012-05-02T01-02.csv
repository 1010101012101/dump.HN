With respect to your argument, we are in agreement: there is reason to suspect that evolution as a reaper has become more tolerant; on the flip side, I'd argue that genetic diversity is <i>increasing</i>, as a consequence of with an unbridled phase of expansion.

And you say to customers who come to that marketplace ""Don't worry, we're going to do everything we can to protect you from bad purchases"".  Then you say to sellers, ""No deals behind closed doors.  You want access to the marketplace? Sell out in public.""  Every time you use the iOS in app purchase API, Apple has a way to track the payment.  Lets say the customer pays for a service inside of an app that never gets rendered.  The customer can then contact Apple who can verify if the payment was processed, and can go about returning the customer's money while policing the marketplace.  But if the purchase for a service rendered inside the app happens outside the app, then customers will have a much more difficult time getting recourse for making payments to a service provider (app maker) whose app doesn't work properly or doesn't provide the services that the user payed for.<p>Having said all that, Dropbox provided this API to developers.  They should have built it to work inside these rules.  They could let users create Dropbox accounts, they just would not be allowed to charge users from outside of an app for services that would then be rendered inside the app.  It sucks, I know, but it's an important part of ensuring the quality of Apple's marketplace.",1335922846

If the author is reading this: your article is good and you should feel good.<p>One more fun thing about Bloom filters: generalized, they're not just a way of testing for set membership. They're a way of getting an upper bound on some function of a finite input set. For example, suppose that I have a set of a million names and how tall that person is, and I want a data structure that will give me an upper bound on the height of a person given the name. I know, this is totally contrived, but here's what you could do:<p>1. Make an array of height values, initially zero. Call it heights.<p>2. For each name, get several hash values: h1, h2, ... hn.<p>3. For each hash h, set heights[h] = max(heights[h], height). In other words, you're only pushing the height values upward.<p>4. To get an upper bound on a person's height, hash their name and look at your heights array. The upper bound is min(heights[h1], heights[h2], ... heights[hn]).<p>(If you want to be <i>very</i> technical, this works not only for numbers, but for any set that supports max() and min() operations.

You cannot make your services cheaper on other platforms. You have to charge atleast what you charge iOS users for the same service. This is to prevent the success of alternative app stores that will take only 20% or 5% cut.

The Chicago School cries tears over lost market efficiency.<p>But that's a far smaller problem than that <i>monopoly allows the monopolist to choose winners</i>. Maybe not for all time, but it's the same argument that's been used against command economies, bailouts, and even just plain government regulation.  Generally wrongly in the last case, and mostly in the second.<p>Free markets are based on the principle that buyers, sellers, and ideas meet on equal footing.  Where an entity or cabal can select winners, what you've got is no longer a free market.<p>Which is a pity, as free markets are generally powerful forces for good.",1335920697

I went back for my masters a few years ago in exactly that situation (but for the masters rather than a bachelor's degree.)<p>I was SO certain that I wouldn't do anything in CS. I took all my undergrad biology courses, and applied to biology grad school. And played with the biologists some. And discovered that nobody over there really valued my CS skills all that much! Bizarre.<p>But that going into a CS master's program I was able to get permission to spend well over half my time playing with biology and just coast through the program on my experience while picking up a new discipline in biology.<p>Harder to do that on an undergrad program, I guess, but I bet you can find some way to leverage all your experience.",1335920659

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_sy...</a><p>In my opinion:
OpenBSD - Focused on security above all else. Host project of OpenSSH and pf/carp/altq?. Lags behind on architecture support and performance (Previously poor SMP performance?). Primary use: Router/firewall.<p>FreeBSD - All around features and performance (zfs,dtrace,pf,linux syscall emulation layer). The most popular, and I believe has the most development effort. Popular freebsd derivatives: pfSense (firewall appliance), FreeNAS (zfs storage appliance), PC-BSD (packaged up for an easier desktop experience). Primary use: Desktop/server/firewall/storage/database.<p>NetBSD: Focused on architecture support. Supports 57 platforms/15 processor architectures: <a href=""http://www.netbsd.org/ports/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netbsd.org/ports/</a>. Primary use: support on embedded/uncommon hardware.<p>DragonFlyBSD: Interesting technologies being developed: HAMMERfs (compare with zfs), application snapshots, virtualized kernel. Matt Dillon's fork of FreeBSD adding the spirit of AmigaOS. Primary use: Compute clusters?",1335920649

Hes not trying to <i>mock</i> nerds, but rather to point out that their mental model of how the law works is woefully mismatched to how the law actually works, with a great deal of resulting whining and handwringing that could be avoided if they bothered to learn and think a bit about it.

Also ALL of his examples are completely black/white or grayscale images of PRINTED or PAINTED objects, which naturally all do not achieve #000.<p>His views are entirely personal, as are our own.  Personally, I found the #000 in his Next Logo to be the worst aspect of the whole design, since its extreme contrast suggests a low-tech print process or an old EGA screen incapable of more nuance.

4359703,comment,4359257,4359257,1,0,nrmehta,,,"In disclosure, I'm a ""backer"" of app.net and am on the alpha.  And as a hardcore Dark Knight fan, I can fall for any DK quote.<p>But while I respect MG's other writing, I don't agree with all of his conclusions here.<p>Some thoughts:<p>1.  He states that ""the web is simply not conducive to a user-supported service reaching the scale of a Twitter"" to imply that success = scale.  I actually believe the app.net could become a lot like HN - a relatively (web-wise) small group of people who all get value from the service - enough to pay for it.  Does it kill twitter then?  Probably not?  But does that mean it's a failure?  I don't think so.<p>2.  Furthermore, let's examine this point that the only services that can get to scale are ad-supported.  He certainly has good empirical data (facebook, twitter, etc.) to back him up.  But in the software world, open, non-commercial efforts (e.g., linux, smtp email and more broadly the internet) have had gigantic impacts in terms of scale.  As others pointed out, wikipedia is an example of a service in this vein.  I think we haven't played out the experiment yet of what do open, non-commercial distributed services look like.  I wouldn't give up on that.  I personally think that any true communications utility long-term needs to be open (like email).  app.net is still commercial so not fully there - but clearly (IMHO) more transparent and open than an ad-supported model.<p>3.  MG also doesn't talk about one of dalton's meta-points which I also feel passionately about.  The conventional wisdom seems to have accepted that an ad-supported future state -  where ads follow us around, personalized to what they think we want, making us think our services we're getting are ""free"" when they really aren't - is the only possible future state.  I know Tom Cruise got followed around by ads in ""Minority Report"", but that doesn't mean it has to be our future.  I personally believe that humans will recognize over time the real cost of advertising and eventually converge to a more balanced world of paid and faux-free (ad-supported) services.  I'm not saying ad-supported will go away - just that there will be choice (which was actually the main point dalton made in the first blog post he wrote on this topic).<p>Overall, I think Dalton should be commended whether his effort works or not.  He re-sparked some very important discussions and was willing to take a chance on his ideas.",1344490849

A mobile phone comes handy when you have to send just a few SMS. But when it comes to bulk SMS, it is best to use an SMS messenger so that you can send SMS from PC because typing text so many times and adding hundreds of contact names at one go becomes a tedious job and may be impossible to do.",1344489010

There are a number of side missions where you descend onto planets in a multi-terrain vehicle and are supposed to check some things out (you can get out of the rover as well). Although for the most part the planets are barren (much like Mars), I found them incredibly effective at sending the scale message across. The most incredible one though, was a side mission on the Moon, with Earth right up above you.

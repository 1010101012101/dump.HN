I&#x27;ll have to wait until the investment comes through...that&#x27;s how QuizUp works I believe, they unscalably pay people to curate the questions.  Probably why they are trying to go the crowd sourcing route now as paid minions can&#x27;t create them fast enough.<p>About the tutorials, in user testing there was always something any given person couldn&#x27;t figure out without the tutorials.  However, when I added the tutorials with an option to skip, Nobody would bother to read them.

8518142,comment,8515370,8518010,0,0,tedks,,,">When this approach inevitably fails, then this same &quot;societal pressure&quot; will be parlayed into the new common wisdom of outright censorship of the Internet.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to say that social pressure, or in other words, education, is definitely going to fail. Harassers are people. We need to teach boys that they are not, in fact, entitled to women&#x27;s bodies, and hopefully then not just online harassment but also street harassment, sexual harassment, and sexual assault will decrease.<p>But what&#x27;s wrong with blocking 4chan, or gamergaters.com or whatever else? These are sites that are demonstratably, reliably causing people gross personal distress and sometimes egging people on into massive acts of violence. Notably, the UC Santa Barbara shooter was a 4chan member, and almost certainly was radicalized there.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say that &quot;free speech&quot; or &quot;censorship-free internet&quot; are good things; it&#x27;s much harder to look at the actual statistics and realize that every post on 4chan is a little piece of an inevitable hate crime. The average is the total over the number; regardless of the small average contribution of each 4chan post to harassment and violence, the end result is GamerGate and mass murder.<p>Ironically, when it comes to Muslims doing the same thing as white men on 4chan, the media and hacker news is united in wanting to shut down &quot;radical Islamist forums.&quot;<p>At the end of the day, you have to decide what&#x27;s more important: an internet where no website is blocked, or the safety of women. If you decide the former, you are every bit as responsible for the deaths of women as the people who physically pull the trigger, because you said nothing and did nothing when you could have stopped the root cause.<p>As another point, there is massive value <i>to the survivors</i> in making it absolutely clear that what happened to them is <i>not</i> okay; that they did <i>not</i> deserve it; that they <i>should</i> be outraged and that the perpetrators, when caught, <i>will</i> be punished and ostracized. The only way to do this is by actually condemning, punishing, and ostracizing perpetrators. The benefits of solidarity are very real; women who experience victim-blaming after sexual assault have vastly higher rates of PTSD.<p>So societal pressure in favor of feminism and away from male entitlement seems like a fine way to address this problem, and if it leads to the death of websites that organize harassment campaigns so much the better.",1414443533
8518141,comment,8515370,8518010,0,0,chillingeffect,,,"The article likens societal pressure to sexual harassment in the workplace.  However, the power structure is not the same.  In the workplace, bosses/admins had to be convinced to treat the problem different, then the wielded the power to make people cooperate.<p>Online harassment doesn&#x27;t feature an authority figure who can cutoff the access of the harassers though.<p>What is the solution?  I don&#x27;t know.  I think the death threats are a result of the self-hatred and sense of disposession our consumer society creates.  We are motivated by the fear of not having enough and therefore our primal minds are constantly threatened.  The people at the bottom have little to lose and act out.",1414443516
8518140,comment,8515626,8516997,0,0,Erwin,,,"Well, you would put SQL inside a string in Python. PyCharm/IntelliJ already recognize that: as I write execute(&quot;SELECT... &quot;) it considers the string PostgreSQL and autocompletes among the table names in my project&#x27;s database; and If I write (&quot;SELECT foo FROM bar&quot;) if the bar table has no foo, it highlights foo just like it would a Python variable that was not defined.<p>Now interestingly when you are within that SQL string you can press Alt-Enter (the general key for some context sensitive magic) and open a new nested editor window with just the PostgreSQL fragment. Let&#x27;s say that PostgreSQL fragment now itself embeds Python code again (now running server-side using PL/Python). Yep, you can tell it the string inside SQL is Python.. and open another window. I then added an XML string <i>inside</i> the Python inside SQL inside Python, however it wouldn&#x27;t go any deeper. However it does give you the syntax highlighting and language-specific warnings in XML, PostgreSQL, Python within Postgresql and top level Python:<p>Beyond the first level however, I had to manually tell it that this string is Python.",1414443484

Periodically someone will get stupid and talk out of school.  Then what we hear is &quot;Well, there&#x27;s no evidence this is a widespread problem.&quot;  We have no idea how widespread the problem is, and Democrats are fighting tooth and nail to prevent us from finding out.<p>>You might try taking Democrats at their word that the reason they oppose voter ID laws is that they disproportionately affect the poor and minorities who may not have a driver&#x27;s license, for instance, and for whom obtaining an ID might be a hassle and expense.<p>I don&#x27;t buy it.

We only use it to detect reposts when someone uploads an image. It gives some false positives quite often, but that&#x27;s totally okay for our use case. We specifically set it up to err on the safe side. Users are only presented with a &quot;Are you sure your upload is not a duplicate?&quot; message.<p>Currently we&#x27;re just doing a `WHERE BIT_COUNT(images.phash ^ inputHash) < 12` in MySQL over 400k rows, which still works reasonably well (~200ms) given that it can&#x27;t use an index for the XOR/BIT_COUNT operation.

I think it&#x27;s dangerous to bucket people in this way, i know plenty of people with $30k+ gear and use their iPhone most of the time. Those two categories you have are not mutually exclusive.<p>Autofocus in the iPhone is much faster than the majority of Canon (or Nikon) DSLRs, regardless of the number of focus points. Partly because it&#x27;s a lot easier to focus a lens that has nearly infinite depth of field! Most photographers are also gear heads, which is another dangerous thing to say, just like saying (quite correctly) that most serial killers are keen photographers. which true, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily add much to the conversation.<p>why we have this obsession with resolution is largely because of computers. In the &quot;old days&quot; I would make contact sheets and then prints, mainly 8x8&quot; (from a Hasselblad, pre instagram-square-hipness), and they would (and do) look stunning, to use object oriented speak, a fiber print IS-A photograph, where as a digital print HAS-A photograph on the paper surface. They are different, when silver crystals are in (vs on) the medium it becomes something altogether different. In these modern enlightened times we put a photo up on a retina big screen and stare at it from 2&#x27; and of course we&#x27;re going to see imperfections, this creates a cycle of obsession with sharpness. But of course it doesn&#x27;t matter, would a painting be any better if it was created with a smaller brush? This is all a very classical philosophical debate, it&#x27;s the medium is the message all over again.<p>From my perspective this work is impressive, does it make better photos? No, but it does make the photos more representative of what the taker was looking at. Over time we are subtracting the technology component from photography, eventually we will have the ability to record easily any visual experience we have. For me this comes from having enough experience in using equipment and eeking the most out of it, but in contrast my daughter is frustrated by cameras (both her Canon DSLR and her iPhone), she will see something like the solar eclipse and wonder why simply pointing the camera at it won&#x27;t bring about a photo that looks the same as the one that the Mt Hamilton took on their 36&quot; reflecting telescope, or why a photo at her friends candle lit birthday party didn&#x27;t look how she remembered it.

Different investors will have different stages at which they’d like to get liquidity, and now they’ll be able to cash out at the time which is comfortable for them. New funds which are more focused on later stage capital can invest as we grow more and become more stable and predictable with our growth and revenue. The same applies for team members: if someone wants to put their kids through college or buy a house, they can choose to sell some of their equity. Others might not have as many commitments and may choose to keep their shares.</i><p>So basically the Silicon Valley VC ecosystem is reinventing secondary markets for equity shares. This scheme has the same basic purpose as traditional stock markets (i.e. capital formation for companies and liquidity for investors), but is limited to a restricted set of participants, and price formation occurs only during specifically timed liquidity events (rather than continuously). I wonder if investors and founders are really happier this way than they would be on the public markets. If you are an early employee and you want to buy a house (or whatever), would you rather be able to sell your shares at any time to the best bidder or be stuck waiting for the next liquidity event at who knows what price?<p>I think this is an interesting development for a couple of reasons. First it probably is indicative of the huge regulatory burden involved with going public (Sarbanes Oxley &c). Second it shows how much capital really is available in SV VC these days. There is so much money that founders and early investors don&#x27;t even care about access to capital available in the public markets because they can get all the cash they want without having to leave the VC world.

Social Security numbers are frequently used as proof of identity but it is possible not to have one. They are not proof of citizenship.<p>To give you an idea of what this looks like, to get an official photo ID from the State of Oregon you need to provide proof of state residency (generally this takes the form of a utility bill, bank correspondence, etc. with your name and an in-state address on it), identity (a social security card, another state ID, a passport), and legal presence in the US -- which either means legal residency or citizenship.<p>In the case of naturalized citizens, this is simple: you&#x27;re issued paperwork when you gain citizenship. Proof of natural citizenship is more complicated[1], because there&#x27;s a lot of ways to be born a US citizen, some of which don&#x27;t automatically result in documents being filed.<p>People who drive will get a state driver&#x27;s license, which generally has the same requirements in addition to a driving test and the like. State ID cards are frequently just driver&#x27;s licenses with an indication added that they aren&#x27;t actually a license to drive!<p>That all leads to the actual answer to your question: every state handles voting differently. Some require you to register in advance, others don&#x27;t; some require photo ID, others don&#x27;t. My state and a few others conduct voting by mail. Eligibility standards are also allowed to vary by state, with a few constitutional limitations introduced by amendment. That&#x27;s a whole topic in itself, but the brief summary is that there is no constitutionally defined positive right to vote in the US, only a set of criteria that states are not allowed to use to exclude voters (age if older than 18, sex, race).<p>Any major reform of this system would require a constitutional amendment, which is a very high bar to jump in the US.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/idproof.aspx#legal_presence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/idproof.aspx#l...</a>",1414441802

Sacramento is absurd to commute from, same with the Tracy/Manteca/Stockton area (unless you&#x27;re commuting to San Jose, in which case you can take the ACE train).

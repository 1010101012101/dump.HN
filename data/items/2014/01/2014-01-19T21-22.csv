They have the skilled labor to do it.<p>I can get incredulity that they would want to - a chinese certified security inspected android/linux would do what is needed for less money. The US have security checked versions of opensource projects, and it would seem the best way to go. But government mandated projects produce not invented here solutions from time to time.<p>I write the above, but I think this isn&#x27;t an argument about whether China could code an OS, or whether they would code it from scratch rather than basing it on opensource components.<p>I think a lot of Americans are uncomfortable with the idea of China designing what it manufactures, because &#x27;what would we do&#x27;. Inevitably, as number of scientists and engineers in China, India, etc increases, more of this kind of work will be done elsewhere, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the amount done in America has to decrease. The world can just do twice as much inventing, and the speed of progress can double. Or, y&#x27;know, you guys could pivot to Asia, and we can have a 3rd world war.

And you don&#x27;t &quot;transfer&quot; it, you sell it to a party that <i>wants</i> higher risk (for a fee).<p>Derivatives are nice, in that sometimes its possible to separate the risk out from the asset. Consider a $50k loan at 5% with a 1% risk of default.<p>A pension fund and a hedge fund both have capital, but the pension fund have extremely conservative investors and the hedge fund have extremely risk hungry investors. That loan is not a good investment for either.<p>So a derivative is created: the hedge fund agrees to make the pension fund good if the loan-taker defaults for a one-time fee of $550 (the cash-value of the 1% risk + a $50 fee). The pension fund now has a $49,450 loan (actually, it will be booked as a $50k load both paying a bit less that 5% interest - the exact amount depends on the running time of the loan) and a $0 risk budget and the hedge fund just made $50 + a 99% chance of $500 more. All are happy, <i>including the loan-taker who might have struggled to get someone to load him money</i>.<p>(Numbers pulled from thin air for illustrative purposes and lots of details omitted)",1390168765

7086190,comment,7085682,7085682,31,0,innguest,,,"The author of the blogpost is pretending to be &quot;one of us&quot; (people that get lisp) - in &quot;Lisp devotees (myself once included)&quot; - but apparently they never understood it if they&#x27;re still thinking that lisps&#x27; advantages &quot;make Lisp into an unweidly, conceptual sledgehammer that’s often out of scale with the problem being solved.&quot;. The word &quot;often&quot; there also makes me think they&#x27;re making a point without experience or proper evidence.<p>They&#x27;re a lisper who broke their teeth in Clojure. I think when people like me disdain Clojure&#x27;s lispness is because we think it doesn&#x27;t really teach you the philosophy behind it. This is not an argument, just my perception.<p>They&#x27;re also in favor of code censorship (let&#x27;s remember that censoring is detrimental to creative processes):<p>&quot;Giving any programmer on your team the ability to arbitrarily extend the compiler can lead to a bevy of strange syntax and hard-to-debug idiosyncrasies. &quot;<p>I use Racket in production along with my team and may I suggest a humble, easy solution: one person makes a pull request, another reviews the pull, and if there are new macros introduced we can discuss it with the team to see if it&#x27;s necessary. It&#x27;s so simple. The blogpost author is making a big deal out of nothing. To prefer a language that doesn&#x27;t allow that power because the author has a problem trusting others instead of choosing to communicate with their team members is appalling.<p>The author also keeps mentioning Python&#x27;s &quot;simplicity&quot;. How can anything be as simple as (function args)? I&#x27;m yet to understand what people that argue this point mean by &quot;simplicity&quot;.<p>Then the author talks about static checks. &quot;How can a static analysis tool keep up with a language that’s being arbitrarily extended at runtime?&quot;. Simple, do macro expansion before static type checking, as Typed Racket does.<p>They&#x27;re also still playing with SQL DSLs too. I think that&#x27;s such a waste of effort. SQL is already a DSL for talking to the DB. I don&#x27;t want another layer because I&#x27;m not going to be manipulating SQL in my code, because &quot;SQL&quot; has nothing to do with the problem domain I&#x27;m working on. At that point any SQL queries have already been abstracted away inside functions that have meaningful names like associate-product-to-customer or whatever. I don&#x27;t want to talk about SQL ever in my problem domain abstraction layer. Using SQL DSLs as an argument against macros with the angle of static type checking is a poor argument because SQL DSLs are usually for people that use mutable code anyway. I use Typed Racket&#x27;s DB library and its querying functions work together with the type system to let me know if I&#x27;m not handling some potential kind of value that might come from the database.<p>The author then mentions Unix&#x27;s consistency. Unix couldn&#x27;t even decide on a standard notation for command line arguments. Then onto that fallacy that reality is object-oriented. Objects can&#x27;t possibly be as composable as functions because Objects break down into methods (which are not composable, are not first class, etc) whereas functions (lambdas) can make up everything and can really be thought of as an atom for computation (i.e. Lambda Calculus).<p>Complaints like &quot;Clojure has nine different ways to define a symbol&quot; are moot. Pick one that your team likes and go with it. On to the next thing. Also, to argue against Lisps by arguing against Clojure is like arguing against democracy by arguing against the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<p>I do believe the blogpost author is severely misguided in their criticism. To say things like &quot;Python wants the conceptual machinery for accomplishing a certain thing within the language to be obvious and singular&quot; while ignoring the fact that lisps machinery is obviously much simpler and obvious and singular - again, (function args) - is disingenuous. It does make me believe that all their SICP reading was for nothing (I&#x27;ve only lightly skimmed SICP and I don&#x27;t pretend to have read it).<p>The author does acknowledge (en passant) that certain Schemes (they don&#x27;t identify which) don&#x27;t suffer from this complexity (which makes the whole post look more like a criticism of Clojure). I&#x27;d invite the author to look into Racket.<p>They say that lisps &quot;impose significant costs in terms of programmer comprehension&quot;. My experience is that if you divide your layers of abstraction correctly you will be able to work in the problem domain layer where nothing is obscure. And that layer is built from smaller in the layer below, parts that are also clear in what they accomplish because they only do one thing in their abstraction level. I&#x27;ve found that following this rule of only doing one thing per function makes for code that is easy to understand all the way from the bottom to the top layers. Programming this way, however, is the classic, boring way to write code [1], and because it&#x27;s not a fad I guess people aren&#x27;t too much into it.<p>Also to the point above, having already rewritten a significant portion of a Rails legacy app into Racket with the help of my coworkers, it seems that lisps introduce more understanding and shed more light onto the code, precisely because it makes everything explicit (we code in functional style so we pass every argument a function needs) and does away with &quot;Magic&quot; that Rails and rails fans like so much. When something gets annoying to write we implement our own &quot;magic&quot; on top of it, not in terms of silly runtime transformations that lesser languages like Ruby need to resort to, but through dynamic variables (Racket calls them parameters), monadic contexts, etc, i.e. things that can be checked at compile time.<p>And finally: &quot;I think it’d be irresponsible to choose Lisp for a large-scale project given the risks it introduces&quot;. Well, the only risk I&#x27;ve personally witnessed is the very real risk of your coworkers starting do dislike more mainstream, faddish languages like Python and Ruby, because they don&#x27;t allow the same freedom and simplicity and explicitness that lisp does (lisp has a long tradition of making things first-class, which consequently makes these things explicit).<p>[1] We use top-down design to decide what the interface for a given abstraction layer will look like, and bottom-up to decide which functions should be written in the layer below; then we cycle that process by refining the layer below through the same process of defining its interface top-down and then the layer below it as bottom-up. And we use algebraic type checking along with contracts to enforce post-conditions and properly assign the blame to the right portion of the code to speed up debugging. These are all old techniques.",1390168676

So I have been helping a friend of mine with all the math around his new adventure, buying his first flat. Usually he just gives me the numbers directly from the bank and I work with them without questioning much because, although I have worked in finance before, I know jack about mortgages. Still, I had the bank simulation with myself so I deeply believed 0.16%, the interest the bank put on his simulation, would be around the same for everybody else.<p>As you can guess, it&#x27;s not even close. That&#x27;s why I deleted my previous comment, sorry. So why did he have such a nice interest rate? Well, it seems like there&#x27;s a bunch of discounts on the banking system in Europe for mortgages. For example, there&#x27;s a really big discount for disabled people, they will only pay, on a variable rate, 65% of the 3m EURIBOR thus 0.16%. No spread whatsoever.

If a company wants to send a message to a customer, a supplier or its lawyer, they&#x27;re not going to do it on Facebook (with its dubious privacy policies) or post it on Twitter (for everyone in the world to read).

While it was in fact written by some very smart people, we had a very difficult time using some of its constructs that were very cleverly abstracted away behind macros.<p>The problem was that it felt nearly impossible to debug problems we had because of the long, impossible stack traces. Further, trying to get another very smart programmer to understand why some functions behaved in one way and some behaved in very different was very hard to convey. I&#x27;ll reiterate that I thought the other guy I was working with was really smart, and I&#x27;m at least not an idiot, and we both felt like we had a really hard time unwrapping what the code was doing.<p>On the flip side, if it were written in Java (I think some parts are actually but more under the hood), you could point at the code and say &quot;That&#x27;s where the map function gets called on all the workers&quot; (Cascalog is for Hadoop), or run the code and get some kind of stack trace where you could even begin to start figuring out what was going on. We weren&#x27;t even doing anything cutting edge.<p>For me, I love the academic/fun endeavor. I have wasted countless hours playing and learning. But if you asked me if I would base any critical part of my production app on Clojure, especially when there are more than a couple people who weren&#x27;t Lisp experts, I would have a really hard time justifying it after what I saw when I tried.",1390166916

Given the mode-centered architecture of Emacs, this is a big challenge. But questions about very specific indentation preferences pop up on sites like stackoverflow all the time: people want to be able to say &quot;I want a continuation of a line be indented by four spaces, except when the line break is in the middle of the argument list of a function definition -- then the arguments should all indent to the same column.&quot;<p>Coming up with a configurable indentation system that works for every mode would be very cool and thought-after feature.",1390165979

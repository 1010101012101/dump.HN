Typically you can find a rich hunting ground of undervalued and ignored companies below $100M.<p>During the crisis I found it pretty useful to actually screen for negative enterprise value stocks. These were companies where they were trading BELOW the cash they had on their balance sheets. (EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash). Some of these companies were pretty tiny, $10 to $50M mkt cap, but they worked out well. You have to be willing to deal with illiquidity though.<p>2. Odd lot tender offers<p>You can find situations where a company wants to go private and delist. To do that they need to buy out shareholders and get below 300 public shareholders. To do that sometimes they will pay a premium for you to tender shares if you have below 100 shares. Again, this is an area where a small investor can do well but where large institutions are precluded from being active.<p>3. Look for areas where institutions are forced to sell<p>Spinoffs are the classic example. Academic research has shown that spinoffs will in general outperform the greater market. Why?<p>Many index funds are mandated to only hold stocks that are a part of the index. Sometimes an index member will spinoff a smaller unit which cannot make it into the index. The index funds will be forced to sell that company and so its pricing may get below its actual value. That's why spinoffs tend to outperform the market in their 2nd and 3rd year of trading.<p>---<p>There are plenty of other areas too.

Add a big font (30+ px) sentence on what your site does, e.g., ""Create beautiful photo album for FREE"". That saves the trouble of reading the block of text explanation.

For that reason, I quite like Clark's notation for namespaces (which is used by ElementTree and LXML), it makes the relation between element and namespace much clearer. Shame you can't use it in XML documents or XPath queries.<p>Also, that the default namespace only applies to elements, not attributes. I kind-of understand why they did that, but it's still very annoying.<p>> Some people use the namespaces in what appears to be a decorative manner. Some people mandate that the prefix be a certain thing <x:tag xmlns:x=""thing""> works while <y:tag xmlns:y=""thing""> doesn't<p>Oh yeah. Isn't it maven or something, which does that? Or did? I know I encountered it once or twice and I was using ElementTree 1.2 at the time (the one that went into the Python stdlib... and still is) and it doesn't keep track of XML namespace aliases (or defaults for that matter, and doesn't let you set them short of hacking through the private and undocumented namespace map) so everything comes out as `ns0:foo`, `ns1:bar`, ... Perfectly valid, and then you have a retarded tool which doesn't actually understand namespaces (even though the example documents say you need a namespace spec) and want an element called `foo:bar` and not ""the element `bar` in the namespace <a href=""http://foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com</a>.<p>> Some things get it right with xmlns:* , but don't understand what the bare xmlns itself means, so they only trigger namespace logic if there's a colon in the tag.<p>When that happens, somebody ought to get shot. Default namespaces are one of the most basic parts of namespaces (and it's not that hard to <i>parse</i>, though production might be a different issue).<p>>  I'm still waiting to encounter the standard or software that actually uses them correctly.<p>libxml2 tended to work quite well in my experience (mostly though lxml), though I don't doubt I just missed its bugs.<p>edit: damn it, is there no way to escape those damn asterisks in yc?",1282406852

Attackers aren't writing directly to program text; they're writing to data structures that effect command & control (most famously the stack) inside the process. Over the past 10 years, <i>randomization</i> has been more effective than any explicit control over what can or can't be executed.<p>(2) Most modern memory corruption flaws don't involve someone's strcpy(). It's far more common to find math problems in the handling of counted data structures --- you know, like the ones Charlie Stross praises. Meanwhile, if you want ""safe"" string handling, you use a string library.<p>(3) We have pervasive TCP/IP encryption today. It does nothing to address computer integrity. Encryption only keeps attackers from talking to you if you can authenticate and authorize every connection. You talk to thousands of sites daily; authorizing them is untenable. Meanwhile, this business of ""listeners promiscuously logging traffic and cracking it at leisure"" (side note: nobody logs ""promiscuously"" anymore): it takes an awful lot of leisure to crack AES128, or even DES-EDE.<p>(4) ""The world wide web"" has problems, but it's unclear that Stross can actually point them out. Turning Javascript on is unlikely to make you ""some script kid's bitch"" (turning <i>Java</i> on is another story). People turn off Javascript to avoid XSS, which makes one site a bitch, but not your whole browser.<p>(6) <i>Bloody</i> Microsoft took security seriously sooner than any other large vendor, as we're all discovering to our chagrin today. Nobody took software security seriously in 2000 except for software security practitioners. It's as true in 2001 as it was in 1995 that a skilled attacker could have popped any Sun machine, any sufficiently complex web app, any document viewer, any graphics format, or any SSL stack. So why blame Microsoft? They at least got a grip on the problem.<p>Let me be direct: things would have been just as bad if our CPUs had split I&D memory. They'd have been just as bad if everyone used Pascal strings. They'd have been just as bad if we had pervasive IPSEC from day #1. They might be better if we didn't have the WWW, but then, we wouldn't care how good or bad things were (like we didn't seem to care so much when people were owning up DMS500 switches at the phone company in 1991). Things would have been just as bad --- maybe, believe it or not, worse --- had Solaris been the dominant OS in 2000.<p>The problem is, nobody really knows how to make correct software. It's a core problem in Software Engineering and it's unsolved. Without correct software, you can't have secure software. Sorry.",1282406809

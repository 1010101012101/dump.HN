235082,comment,234460,234786,0,0,apgwoz,,,"The ""compelling"" reason for most people seems to be Twitter's lack of stability. Personally, I've decided to accept and deal with it for now and give them a chance to catch up. However, two of the people I follow decided to jump ship, and it would be dumb of me to stick around if none of the people I followed were around anymore... Hopefully that doesn't happen.",1215082463

235079,comment,234903,235067,0,0,froo,,,"Agreed - with things like usernames and passwords, you want to make it feel like they're being involved in process, which helps create a connection. It also helps with the 'stickiness' of your website.<p>If I were to give 2 real world examples, imagine a conversation between 2 people.<p>In conversation one, Person A is constantly talking at Person B, not too, but at - Person B doesn't feel included in the conversation, so probably loses interest and tunes out at some point.<p>Conversation two is a simple exchange between 2 people, with information going backwards and forwards. This conversation is more 'sticky'<p>If anything, I would work at ensuring that you have minimal information required at signup - username, password, email address, simple and interactive.<p>To take it one step further, one could argue that this is infact the perfect configuration for signup information because you are requesting 3 pieces of simple information which is perfect given the human brain's natural affinity to the number 3.<p>Example 1) Comedians usually deliver jokes with the punchline as the third part of the joke, because it has been proven to be naturally funnier...<p>Example 2) Lots of marketers like to highlight that their product takes only ""3 easy steps"".<p>Thats not to say that thinking outside the box is a bad idea - kudos for giving it a try dude :)",1215082029

In other words, when he restarts the server, he doesn't load up any data for the users. Instead he just creates a reference to the filename that contains all the user info and creates a data structure to hold all that info in. Then, when someone attempts to login, he searches through the file and finds the credentials, and if successful pulls all of the users information into memory.<p>Before this change, he stored the information for all users in memory, even the ones who no longer use the site, as soon as the server restarted.",1215081309

You might have wasted other people time, because without your ""SEO"", they could have been served better by SE.

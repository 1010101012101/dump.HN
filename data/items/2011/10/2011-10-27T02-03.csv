This is his first CTO position, and up until August he was the only developer, so a lot of bad practices we have (e.g. no process whatsoever) are holdovers from the way he worked for a year and change. The obvious problem is that working alone dodges an awful lot of problems that arise when you have to work together. Now, we're running into these problems but the CTO isn't dealing with them - he just disengages whenever they get brought up and says something like ""You're right, that's important, but first let's work on ..."". Quite frustrating.<p>And again, no worries on the delete.",1319684169

3161424,comment,3160663,3161279,1,0,guimarin,,,"I disagree with your second point.  I think that making banks which do more than lending money to businesses/individuals into partnerships will do a lot of good.  They won't stiff the US tax-payer with the bill by saying that they are too big to fail and that they risked US tax-payer deposits, as is the case of BofA.  If a partnership wants to take big risks that's their decision. I'm suggesting to remove the moral hazard, by using the threat of financial system collapse as a stick to get the US gov't to foot the risk bill.  3. I do not say kill derivatives, you read that wrong.  I'm more concerned with HFT.  That is trades that are decided on by computers and executed in the single digit milliseconds, contribute to the hollowing out of buildings downtown for data-centers, etc.  4. removing the corporate tax is probably too much of a shock to the system, I think aligning it with the personal tax, eliminating loopholes in both, and lowering both is a much better idea. 5. I think that about 20 years is a long enough time to build relationships and get things that you want done.  I think that there is cultural and idea turnover each generation that needs to be reflected in the bodies that represent it.  Cleaning out the old gives way to the new and the like.  I also think that since we limit terms for Presidents that we should do the same in other places.  I think that long-standing senators can be every bit as much a tyrant as a permanent president, albeit on a lesser scale.",1319683932

What follows from the lack of mass-storage connectivity is that I can't access my files on a public computer, or a computer that I don't have admin rights over (e.g. computers in my university's labs).

I used a WP7 phone for 15 minutes in a store a few months ago, and it seems pretty heavy on MS.<p>Other commenters in this thread have pointed out that Gmail on WP is buggy and lacking in features. Gee, ain't that a coincidence?<p>> 4. Just wait for WP7 userbase to grow.<p>Hah. I've tried this before.<p>In Christmas 2009, I bought a hot new phone on a hot new platform. It was the most innovative phone out at the time. It had the best multitasking (), video calling, great PDF reader, and a great, fast, browser. It had a physical keyboard - which provided all sorts of nice features, like quick access to contacts by typing their names, or shortcut keys in every app. The platform was based on Debian Linux, and allowed native terminal access (i.e., it came rooted), so things like overclocking was a sinch.<p>In fact, save for WebOS, it was the only multitasking phone at the time. But its multitasking is still better than that of Android and iOS today.<p>The phone was the Nokia N900, based on Maemo 5. What happened? Well, the phone sold well, but Maemo eventually died. My phone is now running on a dead platform, and it sucks (apps are suffering bitrot).<p>So, I'm not going down that road again of buying a phone based on future aspirations.

Learning more about their internals, harnessing that for my own ends, creating solutions to real problems I have, without frameworks or IDEs or buzzwords. I don't so much care for anything about the iPad but iBooks.<p>I bought the Macbook Air when Apple upgraded it, and now I carry it with me everywhere. There's plenty I can do on it, even without a network connection (i.e., all my coding), and I really feel attached to my featherweight computer.<p>Mobile coding is really fulfilling, yes. But I will never want to code by touch typing. Since buying the MBA, I haven't once thought about touching the iPad. And I don't see that changing.",1319682221

So I can't talk about Google changing over time, but I do have some baselines to which to compare it.  IMO it's somewhere between the two, but feels more like a startup than like Microsoft (which I liked, fwiw).  I have a lot of the freedom in my work that I'd have at a startup.  I have a broadly defined problem and can decide how best to try and solve it.  I do happen to be on a relatively new and small team, which could be a factor.  I took a couple days this week to add a feature to a popular internal app, because I wanted the feature to exist...didn't ask anyone (other than the guy who owns the app), just did it.<p>I don't think I've been at Google long enough to evaluate how much politicking there is, but I don't seem to have many meetings and as far as I can tell people are happy with me just for being productive.<p>If I were you, I'd interview at Google and, if you get an offer, request to be on a team which is more academic in nature...e.g. ask to be on an AI/ML/NLP team rather than an infrastructure team.",1319681960

The source code of a new version is dropped over a wall after their competitor has already released a device with it(if the source is released at all). Android dev is nothing like the Linux kernel dev. Maybe you would know that?<p>The problem is that Google seems to be unwilling to develop Android in the open. With the fierce competitiveness in the mobile space, I think this stance is understandable (at the least).<p>Apart from that, Android 2.3 is completely open. Manufacturers can take it and do what they want with it. Look at Amazon.<p>Are you trying to suggest that Windows Phone offers Nokia better flexibility than Android would?<p>>Also, Nokia was in talks with Google over Android but Google wouldn't give them many concessions. Your anger should probably be directed at them.<p>Source for this? I'd be interested to read about it.<p>> And it's not even like you can complain about the lack of options on Linux. There's a ton of Android phones coming out every month, each better in specs than the month previous and they're pretty popular and have loads of apps. What next, you'd buy the iPhone 5 but the only thing stopping you is that it doesn't run Android?<p>This is a straw man argument. I never complained about this. My issue is with Nokia, specifically, choosing to go completely with WP7, which, for me, is completely unusable.

In theory, a signal sampled at its Nyquist-Shannon rate may be <i>perfectly</i> reconstructed to its analog equivalent. In practice, quantization (the number of bits used to represent each digital sample) will cause distortion to occur, but the bit depth or resolution of a sampled signal is only limited by hardware - in other words, there is certainly a limitation but one-bit quantization would not be useful (and thus not used) for recording an ultrasound signal.",1319681257

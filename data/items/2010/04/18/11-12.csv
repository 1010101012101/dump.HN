I also wish the author of this article could write better, because he seems to make a lot of the same mistakes I make.<p>Some good points, and a thread of relevance here, but aside from a general call to analysis I didn't see a lot to chew on. The best line in the whole piece was <i>We are obligated to examine what we are doing, whether we are updating our Facebook status or playing Call of Duty, because the results of those actions will ultimately be our burden, for better or for worse</i><p>The worst line came soon after, <i>democracy depends upon demophilia, or love of the people.</i> I'll leave the analysis of that one as an exercise to the reader.<p>There just wasn't that much here.",1271591795

It's not a free-floating line of credit--it's an agreement that you will pay this amount per month for 30 years, and there are no discounts for going faster than the schedule requires.<p>Think of it in this way: as an investment, I'm making a secured loan to you from which I am expecting a given return over the next 30 years. If you're excited to pay me off in 5 years instead of 30, maybe we can make a deal (quite often there's refinancing involved in that arrangement) but I got into this deal expecting 30 years, not 5 years, of interest at that rate, and you agreed to that, too.",1271590202

In this case, the broker's corp cards were not being used in the same way a typical employee would expense a purchase to the business. Rather, Wiseguys was just making up fake identities, and providing their own employees real identities for cards(this was the mistake that got them noticed).

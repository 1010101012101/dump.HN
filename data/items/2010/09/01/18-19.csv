In fact the best thing you can do is to maintain your ability to keep that high paying job or keep getting a higher pay, so that you can cause more economic activity here, where you live.<p>And the chosen few are not always a chosen few, they might have been the most hardworking and ingenious few. And quite often its those few who build places like University of Chicafo (Rockfeller), build 3000 libraries (Carnegie), build Stanfords, Yales, Harvards which create more people like you. Even if I want, I would not be able to help as many people to that an extent because I am not rich.<p>The problem is there are not enough rich people, to create enough economic activity to provide enough jobs. A 20,000 sqft house will employ more people in its construction than a 2000 sqft house. 1000 caddillacs will provide more work than 1000 Neons. Its not that the rich are more important than the poor. The truth is that the rich need the poor to get richer, the poor need the rich to get richer.<p>Have you considered, you are in a minority in your town, because you may be in the minority who may have decided to work harder and study more than others in your town?<p>I think thats one area that one can help to change the tides, work with and convince youngsters to take on the tough subjects, the ones that can sustain high paying jobs.",1283367491

What people are experiencing and objecting to is <i>corporatism</i> [1].<p>I believe that if people would give <i>real</i> capitalism a chance, the result would be positive. But as it stands now, the economics are too intertwined with the politics. In order to successfully implement real capitalism, the power that the state wields to erect regulations that can be subverted would have to be stripped: we'd have to neuter the government. Clearly the government would never allow that to happen.<p>[1] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Corporatism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Corporatism</a>",1283367350

The big problems in picking an advisor are lack of information and lack of opportunity.

On the other hand there may be the professor, who everyone says is great and is working on exactly what you want, but they don't have any money for a new student. You usually find yourself in these types of situations when choosing an advisor.<p>Bad advisors probably set me back at least a year and my former labmates as much as 3 years when they quit the lab shortly before our former advisor ""resigned"".

The blog post goes over the WHYs.<p>So I am suggesting: if you are going to put a pass phrase into this software in the first place, just use the pass phrase.<p>The only trouble here is that you need a backup plan.  Sysadmins like to make you change your password periodically, and this policy differs for every system you use, so you have to somehow remember your new passwords/pass phrases along with which sites have your old passes.<p>The sysadmins have good reason: what if someone DID figure out your password/pass phrase? and what if you did not know it?

If there's one thing I dislike about the past few years of the startup scene, it has been this circle jerk echo chamber of ""we're great, let's all go for a drink to celebrate"".<p>Canada has a broken VC industry. Our telecom industry is indeed backwater. People are getting into startups because there's no other option for them, and the startup jobs offer lower pay with fewer benefits. This would be a great tradeoff if Canadian startups actually thrived to the point where early employees could make back their investment. But the track record is fairly poor there. Government grants and funds prop up a large percentage of Canadian startups for the 5 years or so that they manage to survive.<p>These are problems we face today with solutions that will require long term thinking to resolve. I think we have the right attitude at all levels in this country. All levels of government across the political spectrum are on the entrepreneurship bandwagon, and there is no longer a stigma to starting a business.

We can also assume that the legal system in that country is stable enough to grant Julian a fair trial and judge him based on the evidence.<p>To date his only defense has been that this is a deliberate attempt by unnamed powers-that-be to smear his name because of his role at wikileaks.

High rate of technological development in Japan, Korea, and China right now.  China particularly is hellbent on creating Chinese alternatives to everything, including x86 CPUs.<p>2.

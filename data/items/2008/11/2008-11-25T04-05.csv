Although I would love to have 500 customers (a milestone I look forward to), our current team size (3 people) would make that hard and would probably result in my head spontaneously exploding!<p>We are however working diligently on a couple of utilities and technology that can be considered a single product/service and would allow us to scale quickly.",1227589133

376014,comment,374722,375626,0,0,Retric,,,"Yep, pascal had ^ and @.<p>Around 5 years ago I was spent a lot of time working with really old Object Pascal and some C code that was upgraded to OS 8/9 and then left to rot.  Let me just say that low level networking code on a OS that does not have threads is a PITA.  They had something like interrupts but you could not allocate memory during them.  You had to first allocate using Handel's and then do something before working with actual pointers as part of your run loop and then use that memory during the interrupts. Meh, I think it might have been the most fun coding project I have ever been on, but I don't want to do that again.",1227588982

American children...<p>It does not support the second claim:<p>>The regularity of their number systems also means that Asian children can perform basic functions—like addition—far more easily...<p>I don't have a copy of the book to hand (in India and haven't managed to find it yet) - I can only see the online excerpt.

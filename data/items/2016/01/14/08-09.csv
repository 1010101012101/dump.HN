No need to interpret my words in the most absurd way to make it easy on yourself. ;)<p>> <i>I spent an hour or so digging around for those stats in my opening comment. I&#x27;ve spent probably another hour or two reading your comments and typing up all of my comments.</i><p>People do not need to be green on the issues they choose to vote on. Having prior knowledge and expertise is what makes an expert an expert.<p>Liquid democracy, from every indication, appears to be vastly superior at fairly selecting experts to vote on issues than the silliness we&#x27;re using right now. Since experts can have legitimate philosophical disagreements it&#x27;s only part of the solution. A mechanism for the establishment of city-states to create a market of legal systems is one of the other important pieces.",1452758656

They don&#x27;t seem to have any engineers studying hydrodynamics, percolation, diffusion or geometry or physics in their offices. They reason in terms of big arteries and making car go consistently fast there (50) and construction costs and rely on magic for congestion and diffusion.<p>Riding a bike feels like you are gonna die every morning. Especially in winter.<p>They weirdly enough make expensive dangerous bike paths to solve the problem that are more likely to cause accidents than none. And they evaluate that a fall from a bike make cyclists safe with a 50 cm security distance (I am quite taller and when I fall, it is much more 1m20 margin).<p>Let&#x27;s say that even if some jerks found it funny to scare cyclists and sometimes bump them, on the 99.99% distribution they are nice people but a tad forgetting to watch there mirrors when opening their 50 cm doors in my 80 cm &quot;safe&quot; space on the streets.<p>Had some bruises, fears, strong words and went to the hospital get my wife after some accidents.<p>Still alive, though. Still alive. Pretty proud of us and faster/cheaper than most transportations (car and subways included).",1452758573

That&#x27;s quite a bit of overhead as well as there shouldn&#x27;t be a need to send the root cert. Save yourself some traffic. Also, you could probably pare down the cipher list somewhat. The combo of DHE + 4k RSA is probably going to chew up a bunch of CPU unnecessarily.<p>But pretty nice so far.",1452758569

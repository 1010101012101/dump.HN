Where X can be anything in this universe.<p>Second, you are trying to turn a personal experience into a generalization. A good question to ask would be what would happen If the college enrollment dropped by 10% or 20% or 50% ?  How would this affect the workforce and the industrial output?<p>Another extremely important question is that how do you decide who exactly should drop out?? \nShould people drop out on basis of financial resources or some limited test of intelligence. The problem is that it is hard to tell who should enroll and who shouldn't.<p>While certain subjects can be learnt online, a large number of subjects cannot be learnt.

But I'd expect to have a much better chance at getting into YCR than YC. As such, were I looking for a small amount of funding, I might look at YC and think ""why bother, not a chance"" and then see YCR and think ""let's pretend I applied to YC, then I actually have a chance at this one!""<p>And sure, the cost of applying to each is just filling out an application, and so in future I (the hypothetical me that is in a startup) might apply to YC, knowing that the worst case scenario is I become eligible for YCR. But right now, even the time spent filling out an application is a waste of time if you don't think you can get accepted - but perhaps less likely to be a waste of time applying for YCR.<p>As to why people would want to lie to apply to YCR - a part of the reason for YCR, and for possible funding, is the PG quotes saying ""we are always going to miss some of the best..."" etc, and the idea that teams applying to YC, given they <i>thought</i> they might be good enough, they are more likely to be good than teams who thought they <i>definitely wouldn't</i> be good enough for YC.

One of the reasons that Macs lost the battle was because they couldn't compete with the latest and greatest hardware that that Intel churned out. Through most of the 90s Apple stuck with unpowered hardware while being clobbered by Dell and HP's prices (due to higher volumes and probably better supply chain management). This is no longer the case - in fact, because of Apple's massive iOS device volumes they can probably beat the bigger manufacturers on price this time around.<p>All they need to do is keep up with the hardware trends and keep refreshing their product line. So far they've done this (retina, dual core on iPad 2, cameras etc).<p>So, it's not like the old Win vs Mac battle since the hardware playing field is almost neutral (or perhaps there is a slight Apple advantage here).",1302509447

For some words the distinction between 'make' and 'process' is much less clear; I don't have an opinion on what the consensus is on whether flour is 'made' by humans or not, if the discussion had started out with this example, I wouldn't even have bothered replying.<p>Language is fluid and loosely-defined. It's not because the dominant interpretation is that honey comes from bees, that there needs to be a 1:1 relationship between other source materials and their end product so that the same word 'make' can be applied to those processes. Your demand for an explanation into the difference is therefore meaningless; there is an inherent vagueness in the word. Not everything is so defined that it can be explained in the way you apparently want is.<p>For example, I mentioned that honey is only mechanically processed from the hive into the pot. Does that mean that all processes where only filtering occurs do not constitute 'making'? No. Does it mean the inverse? No. In the flour example, one could make the case (I'm not doing so, I'm just explaining the mechanism) that the conversion from wheat into flour is purely mechanical and therefore does not constitute 'making'. But I don't find it a convincing argument. It just shows that each circumstance needs to be examined from several angles, and that (as I mentioned several times) there is no single definition.<p>(I had a paragraph here on the 'opinions' part of your argument but it was too vitriolic - objectively, I can't tell from your post if you meant it as I interpreted it; so I'm going to suffice with saying that this is not about 'opinions'. It's a about definitions, which are not opinions).",1302508878

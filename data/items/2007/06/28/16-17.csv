All the applications would go through each team, and any team that wants to accept the application is responsible for mentoring them.  That will scale beautifully, because more teams lets them accept more applications which will result in even more teams.<p>But that's just my guess.",1183049814

The difference between Coke, Pepsi, and other colas is more marked.<p>I suspect a lot of people that automatically reach for a Diet Coke every day would also spot the difference.<p>I get the impression you don't drink it?",1183049567

Yeah, there are some features, but I don't use most of them.<p>..You do live in a capitalistic society you know ;) People make things to sell them.  Sometimes there's a specific business advantage to giving something away for free, but I can't imagine that the returns from doing that would be more than the returns from people buying Visual Studio.<p>Sorry for the harsh(ish) words, but this is America, and you don't get much for free.  The ad-driven revenue model is beautiful, amazing, capitalistic communism, but not applicable to everything.",1183049507

YC seems like a cool idea, so if you guys manage to scale it, great!  If other people do something similar, that's good too from my point of view.<p>I'll defer to your longer involvement with technology, but YC is inherently a people operation, rather than a technology operation. I think technology scales more than people in some ways, but like I said, you guys are doing something good, so it's all icing on the cake, I guess.",1183048996

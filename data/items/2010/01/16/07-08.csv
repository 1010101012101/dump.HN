I don't know what a better label would be.""<p>They've created something new, and it seems to be very powerful.  By allowing some small-scale free-market enterprise at the local level, but keeping iron-fisted control at the top, they seem to be maximizing their competitiveness wrt the rest of the world, in a no-holds-barred fashion.<p>Our Western system is in some ways inherently too fair to compete effectively with this new scenario.  Not sure what that means but I suspect it isn't great if you're a big fan of western ideals, most particularly the idea that the rights of individuals should be paramount.<p>I sometimes wonder if Asian cultures simply don't believe that the way we do.  They seem to have a bit more of a 'hive mind' thing going on.  Europe and USA have had to deal with a crazy mix of cultures and ethnicities; not so much in Asia.",1263628635

1056660,comment,1056341,1056638,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Because there's a difference between a geek and an employable geek.<p>There, I said it, it's not going to be a popular opinion, especially since I'm a Canadian expat in the USA ""stealing your jerbs"". I know <i>many</i> others like me, who are being well above average rates to work in this country, whose very employment carries steep legal and bureaucratic overhead for our employers. Yet Canadians, Indians, Europeans, etc etc, are still being imported by the planeloads. I know for a fact that our HR department scours American schools for qualified graduates constantly, yet we can't fill spaces quick enough.<p>I've thought about this some, and my conclusion is that a lot of American geeks just don't work very hard - you have the people who hang out on Digg/Reddit all day. Yeah, they're geeks, but how many languages do they know? Can they build a site from back to front? Do they know their algorithms? People on HN need to realize that they're a vanishingly small minority of the set of all geeks, and that as a crew are in general much more ambitious and capable than most. There's a long way between ""I like computers"" and ""I'm willing to pour ungodly amounts of time into learning computers"". For every geek who takes the time to learn all the toolkits and languages to get employed, there are 500 others who couldn't be bothered, and will complain endlessly about undeserving foreigners stealing jobs rightfully theirs.<p>In other words, for every geek who knows Python inside and out, is up to date on all the latest web technologies, has experience building large scalable systems, etc etc... there are 500 others who can only write VB, and will endlessly complain that they're not employed, or that they're not being paid enough. Unfortunately no ""geek employment"" number will ever be able to separate the two.",1263628354
1056659,comment,1056174,1056536,0,0,rick_2047,,,"I find a flaw in your reasoning sir, you are making a rather large assumption that in pair programming both the participants must have same set of skills. Its rather the opposite I think, they must actually have mutually exclusive skill sets. Like one should have a problem solving mind(navigator) and the other should have a solution implementing mind (driver). Thus if they both work parallel they would actually take more time in solving the same problem rather than if they work in series. For an example if I want to make bio informatics program I would rather be a driver and code and have a navigator who has skills in the other parts of the program.",1263628276

You are taking people best suited to programming and giving them the job of creating a specification which is then given to lower paid code monkeys proficient in Java to churn it out.<p>I'd kind of cheapens the craft when people look at it in this way, my AI lecturer last year was describing the different roles in creating an AI system and saying that that the job you want is a knowledge engineer is the position you want and the programmer is just a nobody who translates it all into code.",1263627182

There's a lot of stuff I'd buy for $200 if it could be had.

1056641,comment,1056406,1056528,0,0,silencio,,,"> I think lots of people just like carrying around a big black camera with their long kit zoom lens on it.<p>You have no idea :) I got my first DSLR back in September of last year, and I've taken it with me to about a dozen holiday dinner meetups and vacation trips to touristy places like the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas since. If I try to use my iPhone or a P&S (as a backup camera), a lot of people end up walking through my picture or can be really rude about giving me a little space to move around and take pictures.<p>But....when you've got a comparatively huge DSLR (well, my D5000 isn't even huge, but it looks intimidating enough with even the 18-55mm kit lens, let alone my even-bigger-with-hoods 55-200 or 12-24), people around you tend to give you a little space and courtesy to let you take your pictures to your heart's content. I also don't get as many people asking me to take pictures for them, cause they assume big camera must equal pro photographer that should be left alone. Not that I mind doing that for others, but sometimes it's inconvenient.<p>So I did find it a bit odd the article went out of the way to mention that DSLR's scream ""look at me"", because that's practically a selling point to a lot of people. :P",1263626280

We have a new robotics club at our college where we also put aside some time for non-technical things. The volunteers hit upon the happy idea that we should make a interesting report to be sent to our university (we are a private one so the office is in the area....somewhere). The title will be ""What ideas for educational reforms can a student get by just watching movies"". So now we are all looking for movies which we will show to the group and make notes on them and then forge a report on the feasibility and prospects of such reforms in college education. We have two movie lined up the recent hit in India <i>3 Idiots</i> by Amir khan and one of my favorite <i>Accepted</i>.<p>I request you all to contribute more movies in this genre.

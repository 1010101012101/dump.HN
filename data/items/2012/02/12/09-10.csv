3581486,comment,3581354,3581414,5,0,greenyoda,,,"Software development seems to be something that's very different than what humans were ""built"" (evolved) for. During the millions of years over which our brains evolved, we had to be acutely aware of our environment so that we didn't get eaten while foraging for food. Driving might be similar to that: keeping your eye out for danger while your main goal is navigating your car to its destination. But that doesn't suggest to me a million-core machine -- it's more like a foreground process with a couple of lower-priority background processes. And adding just a few extra distractions to driving -- cell phones, texting, kids yelling in the back seat -- increases the probability of accidents, which suggests that our capacity for attention is quite limited.<p>However, software development calls for a very different kind of mental work, one we couldn't have evolved to be good at since our species only started doing it very recently: juggling multiple levels of abstractions in your head along with countless low-level details. That's so hard to do that trying to do it concurrently with other tasks severely degrades our ability to do it. Paul Graham wrote about this very eloquently in his essay ""Holding a Program in One's Head"" (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/head.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/head.html</a>).",1329040352

3581481,comment,3579317,3579733,1,0,tomn,,,"I don't know the theory behind this stuff, but here it goes:<p>Headphone jacks tend to have a capacitor in-line with the output terminals to get rid of any DC bias -- this can cause problems like battery drain, lots of noise when you plug headphones in, and damage to the driver coil of headphones -- not good!<p>I like to think of a capacitor like a shock absorber, with the length of the shock absorber being like the voltage it's currently storing. If you push on one end of a shock absorber, the larger the force (current), the larger the rate of change of voltage (length), so this analogy might be useful.<p>Imagine holding on to one end of the shock absorber while someone else tries to move it back an forth at a given frequency. If they try to move it back and forth slowly, the maximum force (current) is going to be low, and so the total energy will be low and you won't get shaken much -- the shock absorber will just change length (voltage).<p>If they try to move it back and forth quickly, the force (current) will be much higher,  and so you can extract a lot more energy from it.<p>I believe it's the same reason portable devices have poor bass response.",1329040059

When you say python forces you to create interfaces, I am not sure I understand. For me, programming is mostly about creating interfaces (as the interface part of API), python or not. When I refactor some C code, static typing does not help me that much, as what's difficult in C is lifetime's object (e.g. ref counting in C extensions), things like that.<p>What is true is that it is easy to write code that is impossible to refactor, because it is full of globals, or ""stringified API"" (e.g. using a dict instead of objects when the set of keys is supposed to be fixed).

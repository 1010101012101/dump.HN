By which I mean that the friendship predates the employment.<p>They're smart enough never to post anything on Facebook about anything they do together, but a few months ago they went out for an evening on their motorcycles, and the friend and my <i>niece</i> posted about riding bikes on the same day.<p>Management talked to both of them the next morning, and pointedly threatened my nephew's job.<p><i>That</i> is the world Mark Zuckerberg is proud of.  <i>That</i> is the world he considers to have integrity.

In which case Apple will either have to drop prices and profits or firmly entrench itself as the high-margin, low-sales player... and drop profits.""<p>With iPod, Apple played this almost perfectly, driving down their component prices by always being the single biggest customer of their suppliers, then deciding how long they could charge a premium versus lowering prices to keep the delta with competitors prices from getting too large.  They kept the prices close enough that most consumers were willing to pay the premium for the Apple brand.<p>I actually think they will do the same thing with iPhone.

Non-infinite tape is, as you noted, a limit on <i>everything</i> we consider turing complete: this is just running at a much higher level of abstraction than your computer. You could (if you were so inclined) create a physical machine with a grid of memory that behaved according to rules defined by CSS selectors. Just because this doesn't do direct memory access and behave like the computer or a traditional TM doesn't make it not a TM. (Or, at least, any less of a TM than the computer you're using.)",1299598075

Why?<p>The filesystem has gone away.<p>Everything about the previous generation of computers revolved around files. To a user, everything on a PC is a file. Nothing on my iPad looks like a file. There are icons for applications. Are they files? Or is this HTML presented in a browser? Does a user know or care?<p>This simple difference changes everything. No files means that DVDs, floppy discs, thumb drives, and all other forms of storage are suddenly repositioned. iTunes sucks in so many ways, but one way it doesn't suck is that I don't care where my songs are, just that there's a database of songs with an interface that is song-specific. Music playing applications are post-PC ways to manipulate music.<p>Obviously iTunes exists on a Mac/PC as well as on an iOS device. On a Mac or a PC, it provides an interface for dealing with music files, but I can still hunt for the files if I want to. If I move a file, I break the carefully crafted illusion of there just being music.<p>On a Mac, I install software by downloading it and dragging it into my Applications folder. I'm manipulating files. Sure, there are fronts put up so I can avoid the files, like installer packages and the new Mac App Store. But the application files are still there to be manipulated and I can still fool around with the Library and stumble over the filesystem's spoor when I go trekking through the Finder.<p>On an iOS device, there are no files, there is no Finder. Software is installed by some magic process that never exposes me to the implementation. The illusion is complete. This is what makes an iOS device a post-PC device. I imagine that there are or will be tablets and phones where I can break into the device and discover that hidden from the user is a world of files. Such devices won't be post-PC devices, they'll be PCs in a tablet form factor.<p>To summarize, my contention is that ""Post-PC Device"" doesn't mean tablet or phone, it means ""No filesystem.""",1299597399

We had never released a website before and after 4 months of hard graft we released to the world!<p>We posted on HN to begin with and got a mixed response, however we got some great comments on how we could improve the site. Whilst this was going on a few blogs covered us - Venturebeat, Killerstartups, thenextweb and we began to slowly grow traffic.<p>What was exciting for us was that people from all corners of the Earth were using the site! To us novices this was really cool!<p>Whilst this was going on we posted more and more articles on HN to try and find out what people wanted from bookmarking. We emailed our userbase to try and find out what they liked and more importantly what they didn't like about our (their) site. We then collated all this info and set about improving the site. Given that we launched on HN, we wanted to share with you what Favilous looks like now.<p>We have:<p>Added an import facility from Delicious<p>Amended the community page and done it in such a way that we can now keep on top of spam.<p>Completely overhauled the homepage so as more people understand the site and sign up and share useful sites with you.<p>Stripped back some of the functionality as some felt it was too complicated - therefore menu's are cleaner, options are simpler and instructions are better explained. We hope it is now a more straightforward bookmarking tool.<p>Added a tag based view so that users who are more familiar to Delicious will now be able to use Favilous in a Delicious type way.<p>Sharpened up the panels and uploaded more background images for you to choose from.<p>Given users the option to choose a different theme this means you do not have to have a background image at all and this improves performance significantly.<p>In the interests of building a sustainable product, we are currently finalising a list of paid features which we believe our community will value. Having conducted our own research we will be looking to implement Bookmarking of RSS Feeds, Archiving and Search of web content, plus some features which are unique to us. You guys helped us get to this position and so we come to you again - what you would most like to see from Favilous (or just a bookmarking site in general).<p>Thanks for all the help in getting us this far!<p>Steve",1299597074

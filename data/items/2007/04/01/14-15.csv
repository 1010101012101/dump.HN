My husband and I are bringing our children along for the journey as we work on our start-up. <p>We went through the start-up stage with another business before we had children, but we won't think of postponing this start-up because of our kids. It is hard work to combine starting up and parenting, but being parents while working a traditional 9-to-5 is hard work, too. <p>We have found that we are happier when we are being creative on our own, regardless of income level. When we're happy, the kids are happy, too.<p>They have adapted well to everything we've thrown at them so far. And we are encouraged by their go-with-the-flow attitude.<p>In the end we want them to understand that you make your own life. The best way we can teach them this is to actually do so ourselves....and that's what we are doing.<p>Sounds like that's what you are doing, too.\n \n",1175437058

By that time, Madison Avenue had learned well how to manipulate the language, and the same condition became _operational exhaustion_. It had been stretched out to eight syllables. It took longer to say, so the impact was reduced, and the humanity was completely squeezed out of the term. It was now absolutely sterile: operational exhaustion. It sounded like something that might happen to your car.&quot; - George Carlin, When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops (2004)",1439060375

Unfortunately we can never prove such a theory in the mathematical sense since we can never be sure that the next time we perform a given experiment it will still yield the same result (it could be that the laws of physics change over time or work differently in other parts of the universe). However, we can easily falsify a given theory if we can produce even one single observation where the theory does not fit reality (which is precisely why general relativity was needed to replace the classical theory of gravity, which could not explain all experimental data [actually the new theory came even before the data in that case, which is amazing in itself]). So, in a sense, proving that something is not true is the only thing we can do with absolute certainty.<p>That said, theories that are proven wrong by experiment and replaced by other theories  are still valid in their domain of applicability, so to say as an approxomation of the larger theory.",1439060075

10028266,comment,10027356,10027870,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"I think the basic problem is that the ease of adding new dependencies means that dependencies are added without consideration. Delegating auditing of dependencies to a specific individual on the team can solve that problem if that person is very conservative about what they allow, but that seems to no longer be the norm.<p>It&#x27;s not just security that this hurts: I&#x27;ve worked on a few projects now where one or two of the dependencies introduced early on later became the source of the majority of the work on the project. Often dependencies added to solve one problem are unable to solve other problems and are designed in such a way that they are tightly coupled to everything that uses them. The result: either you put in the time to rip out the dependency, or you pile workarounds on top of workarounds to the point that it would have been easier to write the dependency yourself.<p>There is, of course, a balance to be had here: a solid library can save you an immense amount of work. But only a handful of the libraries I have used are actually solid, and I&#x27;m increasingly unwilling to pull in dependencies I haven&#x27;t used before.<p>As a rule of thumb: I never want to use a library that&#x27;s not versioned 1.0 or higher. A 1.0 version <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean that it&#x27;s ready for use in production systems, but a 0.x version number has always meant it&#x27;s <i>not</i> ready, in my experience.",1439059715

 - &quot;States close to AD can be achieved if person distributes attention on the field of vision periphery, i.e. focuses attention simultaneously on the regions above, below, on the left and on the right. Distribution of attention on the periphery requires voluntary efforts, since human visual apparatus is designed to detect objects in the central part of the vision field. There is useful deconcentration method when one imagines all objects are pictured on a transparent screen in front of him and concentrates attention only on the surface of the screen. This suspends spontaneous eye movements and focuses attention not on objects, but on fragments of vision field. If person performs the exercise correctly, his eyes do not “cling” to objects when he turns his head, but remain motionless relative to the head. This deconcentration type is called “planar deconcentration”. Further explanations can be found in Bakhtiyarov’s works.&quot;",1439059301

At this level, turning investment into fiat means stopping economic value creation and preventing economy value retention.<p>Unless you really believe that the unemployed would be destroying more than 100% of the value of the investment they need to work, it&#x27;s an incorrect assumption.<p>I think the erroneous assumption that Austrians make is that they think investments are not worth it in the private markets if they have negative returns.<p>That is incorrect, stores of value can be useful as long as they retain part of their value, that is unless their returns are above -100%. You don&#x27;t throw out a bag of apple because one of them may rot early. Idle fiat has a return of -100% to the aggregate economy over the time that it is made idle. On the aggregate, it&#x27;s just paper it doesn&#x27;t actually carry value forward. It is a claim on value created by others who have not promised to create anything. If you had instead invested the money into stock or a bond, something that enables production, even if you would only have generated -50% returns, you would have added much more value to the aggregate than if the savings would have been kept as idle fiat reserves.<p>It is crucial that fiat does not price good short term investments out of the market every time the risk adjusted market rates go below -2%. -2% can be an artificially high rate that puts the private market in a gridlock.<p>Negative returns may well be the natural state for stores of value. Before financial systems existed, almost all investments, had negative returns if you didn’t put work and energy into them. The only way you had to store value was to accumulate stuff, buildings or land. All options either had high maintenance costs, were subject to risk of damage from natural causes and theft, were very volatile or required hard labor to get production out of.<p>Even in societies with good financial systems, getting risk free, hassle free, positive real returns has been difficult for most of history. This probably reflects the laws of thermodynamics that tell us that things tend to decay without work and energy put into them.<p>The 20th century was probably the most notable exception. Because of unprecedented demographic and technological growth, positive risk free returns were easy to find. This however, may not continue forever, particularly amidst a aging and retiring population.<p>Money should not be made an artificial government backstop for stores of value as this destroys the total amount of real wealth in the economy and replaces it with pieces of paper or numbers in accounts. The saving vehicle of last resort should be for people to stockpile stuff they will need in the future (which incidentally creates job because this stuff needs to be produced) not accumulation of fiat.",1439059222

There are optimizations to this, like using Generations in a Generational GC, but those optimizations are still just optimizations for walking the entire heap. BEAM takes a different approach, leveraging the actor model on which it is based: If a process hasn’t been run, it doesn’t need to be collected. If a process has run, but ended before the next GC run, it doesn’t need to be collected<p>Well, how does BEAM know which process ran (so that its garbage should be collected)? Bookkeeping, of course, and that is also &quot;just an optimization&quot;. Similarly, if a JVM object hasn&#x27;t been touched since the last collection -- it doesn&#x27;t need to be examined.<p>> If, in the end, the process does need to be collected, only that single process needs to be stopped while collection occurs<p>And new HotSpot GCs rarely stops threads at all for more than a few milliseconds (well, depending on the generation; it&#x27;s complicated), collecting garbage <i>concurrently</i> with the running application, and other JVMs have GCs that never ever stop any thread for more than 20us (that&#x27;s microseconds or so).<p>While BEAM&#x27;s design helps it achieve good(ish) results while staying simple, the fact is that the effort that&#x27;s gone into HotSpot gets it better results for even more general programs (collecting concurrent, shared data structures -- like ETS -- too).<p>I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again: Erlang is a brilliant, top notch language, which deserves a top-notch VM, and the resources Erlang/BEAM currently have behind them are far too few for such a great language. Erlang&#x27;s place is on the JVM. JVMs are used for many, many more soft-realtime (and  hard-realtime) systems than BEAM, and yield much better performance.<p>An implementation of Erlang on the JVM (Erjang) done mostly by one person, was able to beat Erlang on BEAM in quite a few benchmarks, and that was without the new GCs, the new (or much improved) work-stealing scheduler and the new groundbreaking JIT (which works extremely well for dynamically-typed languages[1]).<p>OpenJDK could free Erlang programs from having to write performance-sensitive code in C (so many Erlang projects are actually mixed Erlang-C projects). While Erlang can be very proud of how much it&#x27;s been able to achieve with so little, instead of fighting the JVM (or, rather, JVMs), it should embrace it. Everyone would benefit.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://twitter.com/chrisgseaton/status/586527623163023362"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/chrisgseaton/status/586527623163023362</a> ,

Is there a sane way for an app-developer-by-day like myself to work out a solid understanding of these concepts so that I can build these systems with a degree of confidence?

For example - a support person talking to a customer on the phone (representing the company BigCorp), complaining about being tricked into submitting a payment for a product feature twice. The support guy/gal can open Pagehop with Option + Space and write &quot;pay :company bigcorp&quot; and this would result in a list of all transactions from BigCorp.<p>Checking activity logs, user data, payment transactions... the list goes on and on. These are all simple queries that don&#x27;t need a special visualization and almost no customization - you simply need the info, fast. This is where Pagehop shines - it&#x27;s a launcher, so it&#x27;s always a shortcut away from you.<p>Team Support would allow you to disperse these tools to your teammates automatically and keep them in-sync.<p>And if you are an advanced user - make a recipe to get an SQL/JSON/etc. query and display results. If I build this feature, I am definitely going to provide something default for this.<p>Coming to think of it - if you have a dashboard in Looker, called &quot;Today&#x27;s Stats&quot;, for example, and lets say you are having a release today - a recipe (plugin) in Pagehop (calling the API of Looker) to show you this dashboard, would be the easiest way to see how you are doing, as often as you like.<p>Finally, as pretty much everything else, the pricing is also hugely different between these products and what I plan to offer. For a team of 10 you need to spend thousands of $, while you would pay ~ $1k for an annual deal for Pagehop with Team Support.",1439058227

If Apple put those rules for an open source project, I&#x27;d reject them just as violently.<p>> Do you have any specific gripes or examples of policies you think are wrong?<p>Yes I think it went far too contextual to be a generic &quot;don&#x27;t be a jerk&quot; policy. It dictates what emoticons one can use and one cannot. Let me backtrack you to history of smileys. Smileys were invented at CMU because researchers often failed to glean the sentiment of a comment made by a peer reviewer.<p>So they started making happy and sad faces on peer reviews. Now, we don&#x27;t know how emoticons would evolve in, say, next 30 years. But it sure as hell is possible that someone in open source community might invent something while coloring outside the lines. If he isn&#x27;t allowed to, we will miss on the invention.<p>Moreover, I have a feeling these policies will be policed more by &quot;community coordinators&quot; or similar people who don&#x27;t code and will ridicule real contributors for using a wrong emoticon in an issue. No real programmer will care about this non-technical piece of junk. Open source is not for that kind of environment.<p>We don&#x27;t know what we will stifle by putting such policies. Thinking that we&#x27;re smart enough to know future is extremely naive.",1439056912

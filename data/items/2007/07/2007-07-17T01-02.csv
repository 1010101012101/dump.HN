Perhaps you're talking to a gifted bunch, but are they really precocious enough to understand the concept of 9-5, let alone ""startup""? If not, then I would cut out points 2-5.<p>I agree that inspiring youngsters is very important, but do you have particular reasons for focusing on the professional aspect of it, as opposed to, say, being able to do cool things with software?<p>Many years ago, there was a kid at a programming camp; he was a bit too young, but not far off from 7th grade. And he declared that he wanted to learn programming to make games, the kind that he played everyday, some 3D RTS. Starting from scratch, for 2 months, that was quite plainly an impossibility. He probably would've had a more profitable experience if he had more reasonable, and relevant, expectations.<p>Rather than PG's essay as a starting point to motivate 12-14 year olds, I would be more inclined to use more ""palpable"" examples, perhaps like the Mars Rovers or movie special effects or something. It'd be pretty cool if you started with a demo where by changing certain parts of the code you could create interesting changes. (But I know nothing about the interests or attention spans of the kids you are going to speak to.)<p>Just a thought. Please post after the talk!",1184637238

It seems kind of silly to be a language snob if the team and opportunity are right.<p>Who knows, you might be able to embed scripting in their product.  Maybe automate a test suite with dynamic bindings to their libraries.  Or maybe be the voice of reason when someone on the team discovers design patterns or IoC and gets delusions of grandeur.

34652,comment,34461,34642,0,0,euccastro,,,"Sorry if I gave that impression.  I realise some of the things  I said in my latest reply may come across as trying to refute arguments which you of course didn't make.  My intention was to go deeper into what you said about the tradeoffs involved.  I admit my arguing for high level languages was a bit out of place in that context; I guess I got carried away by the tone in the rest of the thread.  In particular, in my last paragraph I didn't mean to imply that you were proposing C++ as a pragmatic solution, esp. for startups.  So please accept my apologies.<p>With the Lisper-coding-C++ example I was trying to convey that even if you could think such thoughts, it wouldn't help you much for practical purposes unless you can express them in a convenient way.  So, even if we discard the Sapir-Whorf argument in the literal sense, for practical purposes you may just as well pretend it's applicable.<p>That said, I find different languages <i>do</i> shape how you think about programming.<p>The people that invented Lisp were mathematicians, which of course were used to thinking at a pretty high level of abstraction.  It's not strictly <i>impossible</i> to come upon the same ideas on your own, just as it's not strictly impossible to come upon ideas that are not expressible in your natural language, even if you accept Sapir-Whorf.  After all, somebody had to invent the words of natural languages too.<p>But there is a huge leap between learning a concept(+) and inventing it.  Natural languages evolved over thousands (millions?) of years; modern mathematics took a couple thousand years to discover.  Yet most children learn their native languages effortlessly, and a high school kid learns centuries worth of mathematical advances in a few years.<p>So yes, you <i>could</i> think of the thoughts that higher level programming languages afford without having ever been exposed to those languages, but that would be an exercise of lucidity comparable to finding a bunch of significant new mathematical theorems, or to inventing new words for concepts that can't be readily expressed in English, without having learned about those concepts in French or Japanese before.<p>(+) edit: idea->concept",1184636242

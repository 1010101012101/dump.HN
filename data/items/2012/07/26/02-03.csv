Zynga is fundamentally tied (today) to factors outside of its control (like airlines) but that are (a) controlled largely by one entity (facebook) and (b) opaque to the outside world.  By comparison, airlines are tied to factors (GDP, fuel cost, etc.) that are not controlled by any single entity and that are more transparent (e.g., real-time markets for fuel, widely available forecasts for GDP).

Google is a SOFTWARE company, and specifically a WEB SOFTWARE company.  They are not a hardware company, and they certainly are not a telecommunications company.<p>I don't doubt this will launch with great fanfare, but judging from how many ""new & exciting"" products Google rolls out on a weekly basis, and then shutters shortly thereafter (~2 yrs), I wonder how long this project will stick around.<p>Plus, there's really no evidence to convince me they'll actually be any better than current ISPs at providing wired broadband service.  Laying fiberoptic cables is a very involved, complicated process due to federal, state and local laws.  Verizon has been the leader in fiber optics, and the reason they don't cover a larger area of the U.S. has more to do with local & state bureaucracy than it does with them being ""evil"".<p>Naive assumptions aside, this announcement would have made a lot more sense had they acquired or partnered with an existing telecom company.  Under that scenario, the telecom co. would assume the costly burden of laying and maintaining the cables, and if the project failed there'd be a myriad of avenues for Google to extricate itself and lay the blame for failure elsewhere.<p>If ""hardware is hard"" (it is), then I can't imagine how difficult telecom must be...",1343270292

Bad for others.<p>That said, your understanding is a bit ""off.""<p>Amateur Radio (HAM) has microwave frequencies available for use that would be VERY effective for point-to-point wireless internet.  We even have frequencies that are very close to the existing bands and there would be no problem running LTE over those frequencies.  The problems with amateur radio are regulatory, not technical.<p>Generally speaking, the higher the frequency, the higher the attenuation.  Of course, the higher frequencies are better suited for the kinds of modulation rates necessary for high bitrate communications.  So there's that.<p>But all of this is besides the point.  No technology exists in a vacuum and must compete against others for particular applications and for particular cost models.  That's why telecommunications engineers have no hair and bad tempers.  This stuff is hard.<p>For ""lower"" bitrate communications, wireless is the hands-down winner.  The cost to deploy a network for a given level of service to a range of end-stations is just so much easier and cheaper that lots of other nations skipped over building a wireline network and just went straight to wireless.  Mobility of the stations is almost a secondary concern.<p>Once you get to the point where your communications are less intermittent and higher bitrate, it's really a question of how far you need to go and how much/how often you need to communicate.<p>Lots of LTE stations are connected to a central office (router) via fiber (gigabit ethernet mostly).  Lots more are connected via point to point microwave.  Backhaul of bandwidth is something you dont hear talked about a lot but it's a big part of why it can be hard to get LTE/4G/WiMax into a particular location.  Economics are a big part of that equation.<p>SO, I wish the Google Fiber guys well and I hope they succeed, but the telecommunications market is so broad and complicated that it would be foolish to look at one company's efforts to shake up a single market and equate that with a sea-change in how the broadband market works.<p>edit: I met Milo Medin (who is now running Google Fiber) and he offered me a chance to work at @Home way back when.

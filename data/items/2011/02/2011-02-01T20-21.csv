They've tried educating their customers* about not buying tickets that aren't on the roll.<p>This to me seemed to be the core of the problem; not that the cards were crackable, but that it was possible for a user to select what card to purchase rather than just what game to play. Remove that and the problem largely goes away through simple education about valid play procedures as I suggested.<p>(*  I say educated, but there's the infamous 'Winter temperatures' scratchcard which rather undermines that concept - <a href=""http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1022757_cool_cash_card_confusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1022757_c...</a>)",1296593964

You either store it locally, and as such it is only accessible when the device is on, or it's stored on a central repository or index, meaning it's always on even if one of the devices is off.<p>How do you tackle this? How do you make sure that user A tries to access news feed of user B, and fails to get it because user's B device is offline?<p>Maybe I'm being slow or noobish, but it seems to be the same problem one has with bitorrent: user A downloads from user B if user B is online. If data is common, I have multiple seeds, but social network implies that nobody has the same data. Unless you copy my graph to my friends ""device"" so one has multiple seeds, which could be quite unpractical on mobile devices if I have a lot of friends.<p>How do you solve this ""intermittent issue"" and the synchronization and persistence problems it generates? Without a central ""clearing""/indexing server? Even Skype has ""Super nodes"" to handle this issues...<p>This aside from the fact that ""IPV6 deployment"" is not going to be a easy cake to bake, one has to fix the problems faced by GPG trust model to ensure that two parties can verify (with some degree of trust) that the other party with whom they're communicating is, indeed, the person they expect, dynamic IPs, and so on.",1296593874

It's not too hard to pregenerate a set of every possible ticket combination, just lots of cross joining of numbers tables and a bit of coding of the play rules. Add in the payout rules and you can produce a total set of all possible cards along with the payout for each given card.<p>From this set, we can select exactly the number and balance of paying and non-paying cards we want, chosen pseudorandomly from the set of possible cards. Output that set and sort that pseudorandomly, then send to the printers. You've got a (pseudo) random selection of cards with an absolutely controlled payout pattern.<p>The downside, and what seems to be the critical problem for the suppliers, is that I suspect you'd have less 'near miss' cards this way to entice players.

2167321,comment,2165376,2167127,0,0,jerf,,,"Stop measuring your swap space in terms of disk space, start imagining it in terms of ""amount of time it takes to fill up"". At a nice round 20MB/sec write, it would take a solid 400 seconds to use that much swap at full speed. In reality, you can't fill it that fast either, because it's seeking, also yanking other stuff out to run your other processes, and then sticking the stuff back in to run those other processes, so it's really a mess; the real amount of time it could take just to make initial real use of 8GB of swap could be <i>days</i>, no joke. (In other words, I don't care if you have a 80MB/s drive, it really doesn't matter much, plus swap usage tends to be full of seeks anyhow so it's not like you're going to get 20MB/s either.) Given that a modern system is, relatively speaking, brought to a near-complete halt by being in swap, what possible process are you going to run where you are willing to put up with your system being brought to a halt for even tens of minutes at a time, let alone the hours or days it'll take to fully utilize 8GB?<p>Clearly, you don't need and basically can't use an 8GB swap partition. So, how long are you willing to put up with? That will vary, but let's say 10 seconds before you're ""flipping out and killing processes"". That's a 200MB swap partition. But... that's only 5% of the size of your RAM! If that's the difference between a process completing or not, you've probably already lost. Or you should just kill Firefox.<p>On a 4GB system, the most likely reason a process is pushing you into swap is that it is in an infinite allocation loop, and all having 4GB of swap does is make your system crawl that much more before the process dies.<p>This is a result of RAM sizes increasing far faster than hard drive write speed has. When I had 32MB of RAM, it made sense to have some swap. I could swap out, say, 16MB of unused executable pages (bits of windows, bits of drivers I'm not using, bits of the massive Office suite I'm not using, etc) and get that much more working set, and this could happen in a reasonable time; the system choked for a couple of seconds but recovered in a stable manner. Now swapping out 16MB of executable is a joke. SSDs may change the balance, but these balances have been out of whack for a long time, I rather suspect that even with an SSD it won't be worth swap. Especially since by the time SSDs are truly common 8GBs of RAM may be entry-level because, well, why not? (Poking at Best Buy really quickly,  at the $500 line you get 4GB for <i>laptops</i>, a little over $300 for desktops, coming down fast. I'm not sure they have anything less than 2GB now and even that is really into ""don't use swap"" for the average user.)",1296593459

You should have a swapfile/partition because it allows allocated but currently unused memory (from an application which keeps data hanging around which is not needed for most of it's working life, or an application which simply leaks) to be dumped to long term storage, thus freeing memory for its real use: page cache.

Take the DOM abstraction, it works and is implemented by several SPA frameworks. You can design good looking, ""desktop class"" applications pretty fast. But problem arises quickly when your graphic designers send you those PSD mockups, full of great looking artwork waiting to come to life.<p>With a normal DOM approach you've always been able to solve this. With hacking some HTML, tuning CSS and a lot of swearing you pull through.
But with SPA frameworks that favor ""components"" over low-level, raw DOM elements things usually aren't as straightforward. Very often you need to start picking apart the provided ""ready-made components"" to get any work done. Ends up being very contra-productive and usually takes way longer to do.<p>It has happened to me numerous times before with both GWT and Adobe Flex. Nice and shiny, given you don't try changing the layouts too much.
Surely, I'd be one happy camper if this wasn't the case, web development need to move forward. And I hope the goals proclaimed by both Cappuccino and Sproutcore will work in practice some day.<p>Regarding your other point about routing, departing from the route paradigm will be only be true if what your designing is not a document-centric application. In my world, an SPA can be either document-centric or desktop-like (containing a lot of UI state, as you mention). Think the answer to that is the boring ""it depends"".<p>Worth mentioning, many of these issues are stuff we've been trying to resolve with the Planet Framework (<a href=""http://www.planetframework.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetframework.com</a>), essentially bridging the gap between client and server.",1296593124

2167166,story,,,17,14,GanjaHacker,"Ask HN: Want to do a cannabis start-up with me?",,"I'm an early-30's techie who went through a bit of a midlife crisis a couple of years ago. A divorce sent me into a seemingly un-curable depression which I only snapped out of after doing acid on a hippy bus. Those who know me would be floored by this statement, since I've always been quite anti-drug, even vocally so.<p>My depression was quite humbling. More humbling was experiencing happiness or the first time since I was 6 years old (when my parents started medicating me for ADHD which I now feel was a mis-diagnosis). My depression had made me a poor performer for years, rendering me almost catatonic after my wife left me.<p>Drugs made me happy. I'm willing to bet that legal drugs would have done the same, but well, that's just not the route I choose. After my acid-trip I spent a year smoking ganja, exercising, and facing some incredibly hard truths about myself and my life.<p>I spent 2010 in a ganja-induced haze. I managed to somehow do about $100k in consulting, but mostly I exercised, chased women around, fell in love, lost 100 lbs, and searched for happiness wherever I could, and usually found it alone sitting on the roof of some office building in SOMA (I also learned how to bump locks).<p>Now that I'm feeling more capable, I've put myself back on the job market, and have discovered that most start-ups aren't doing anything that will bring me joy. Today every new company is a groupon clone or a heroku clone.  I just sat down with yet another groupon clone, and am waiting for a heroku clone to come and ""interview me"" in a few minutes.<p>Fuck it, if business in 2011 means talking about cloning shit, I'd rather talk about sativa clones than groupon clones. These bring me more happiness than products who exist only to convince consumers to consume more.<p>Let's do a cannabis-related start-up. Weedmaps owns the ""find me a place to get me high"" market, and they suck donkey dick. I've got a designer, a fellow stoner, who wants to help me build a better weedmaps. She's rad. I even have a guy who is willing to put $35k-$50k into helping build this, plus I personally don't need income for a few years, so I have options.<p>I'm looking for a coder who is a better coder than I am who also is more functional when there's a vaporizer next to her/his keyboard. I'm hoping one of my friends will read this, and think ""hey that writing tone sounds like so and so.. I didn't know he smoked too"".<p>Maybe we'll do a weedmaps killer .. or perhaps we'll just get high together while we work on separate projects, ""Co-Working With Cannabis"" sounds more fun than working for Google, what can I say?",1296591595

Each one of these has screwed me badly. Yes, it's my fault, for not loving source control. You know what? I also don't want to know how my digestive tract works. I just want it to work and mostly leave me alone. If I have a problem with source control, it's like dealing with the after-effects of bad meat. Unless I'm using git, in which case it's like bad meat laced with razor blades.<p>There, I said it.",1296590702

It <i>KILLS</i> the conversation.  It's not 1998 anymore.  Now I either tell them ""I own a software company"" or ""I do special projects for legal/finance/whatever industry"".  The difference in how people open up is tremendous.<p>It's not my fault people have preconceived notions about what I do, but I'm not going to be a social victim of their ignorance.  Other professions do this all the time.  Insurance salesmen and accountants say ""I work in finance."" People who sell light bulbs and toilet plungers say ""I own a distribution company"".

2167091,comment,2166218,2166218,0,0,bugsy,,,"Years ago when I was in undergrad at a top engineering school I had heard about this situation with grad students but it was not clear what the policy was with undergrads. Before starting classes for the first semester, I met with the provost and asked him whether the university asserted any IP claims on any undergrad work, related or unrelated to school. He assured me absolutely not and thought the idea was crazy. I wrote down what he said and asked him to sign it as an official of the school. He thought that was unnecessary but signed it.<p>During my senior year I invented some technology on my own time. A couple years ago a professor from the school found out about this at a conference we both attended, and subsequently I was contacted by one of the school's lawyers who indicated they believed they owned my invention and I was in violation of the school's rights. Fortunately I still had my signed paper and they realized they would never be able to prevail in court.<p>If you have any intention whatsoever of doing creative original work of any sort in college either on campus or off (or even in a part time job off campus), you need to get it IN WRITING that the university will not assert IP rights. If they will not give this to you signed and in writing, do not write a tuition check. Find another college, or better yet, skip college entirely. It is a complete rip off.",1296590500

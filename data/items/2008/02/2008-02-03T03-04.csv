The problem I'm having with this challenge, and Arc in general, is that it's very domain specific.<p>Now, lisp /scheme is really great at making DSLs.  This example makes me think that Arc isn't a new all-purpose language, but rather a DSL language that can easily be modified to withstand criticism.  ""It doesn't have feature x!!!"" ...2 weeks later... ""Well, it does now.""<p>I'm not saying that DSLs are insignificant, or that Arc's creation was trivial, but when examples like this are used, it feels more like a framework than a new paradigm.  I think most Python/Ruby/Haskell/(modern language) hackers could fairly easily implement a library to do what Arc does in about as many lines, but they wouldn't call it a new language.",1202008878

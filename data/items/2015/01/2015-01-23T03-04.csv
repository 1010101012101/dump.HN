Five hours to get from the couch at home to the airport. Astounding. I&#x27;m through the airport and in Melbourne city in under 2 hours.<p>I would definitely pay $100 to reduce that. I think $100 helicopter flights is something I would do with friends just to get a drink across town occasionally. How novel!",1421982191

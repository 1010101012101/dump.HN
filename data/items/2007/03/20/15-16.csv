To me, this is about the scientific approach vs the engineering approach. You can get in trouble with either one. Option one: you have your grand design but nobody needs it. Option two: you keep iterating something but at some point improvement stops (try to cure cancer this way).",1174405632

I'm personally not afraid, but I wondered if anyone had any input on that subject. The things I've heard are that you never want to compete against a company that is smart, fast, and small and 37Signals would be that company. Anyone have any thoughts?",1174404155

4838200,comment,4834372,4837934,2,0,talmand,,,"In the US, the DMCA more or less makes it illegal to reverse-engineer DRM regardless of how easy it is to crack.<p>The DRM could be as simple as the code being ""A"" to bypass the DRM and if you do so, you have broken the law. Even providing that ""A"" to someone else would be illegal, look at all the silliness over the dvd copy protection fiasco. Therefore, they don't even have to pretend that the DRM is strong, just saying it's there is probably enough.<p>It's one reason printer cartridges have chips that communicate to the printer. Reverse-engineering that to provide third-party cartridges is illegal. Well, it used to be, I'm not sure over current policy as the DMCA has a back door for exceptions.<p>For PC games, the DRM is often employed to prevent piracy for the first two or three weeks because typically that's the highest level of sales. After that point it is usually cracked but sales often have dipped anyway. In some cases the DRM is removed in a patch at some point, often because the DRM causes problems for people who paid for the game, which kills long-term sales. Ubisoft recently changed their policies on having a seriously strict DRM to one that is more flexible; many thinking because it hurt their sales and that it was useless anyway.<p>No one thinks of DRM as a long term solution since it is only a matter of time before someone cracks it.",1354042787

The languages with lower barriers to entry also tend to be easier to explore computer science in.  There are some languages like C or assembly that make it easy to understand how the machine works and some languages like Python, Javascript, Lua, or Scheme (sorted in descending in order of how much they get in your way) that make it easy to try new concepts, and a student in university could very well end up knowing no languages from either of these categories.<p>I was lucky enough to circumvent most of these issues by using my mandatory CS courses as an annoying supplement to my programming contest preparation and game programming projects.",1354042762

Growth Hackers are most prevalent in startups, where they wont have the convenience of a larger team of specialists. A 10-man startup (still relatively small) the Growth Hacker has to be able to do the SEO, the Analytics, the CRO, the Social, the PPC, the Retargeting, the Media, and be on the bleeding edge of new customer acquisition technologies as they arrive. New team members may take on some of this work as the startup grows, but for the most part, its all Growth Hacker.<p>The other distinction is implementation. A Growth Hacker needs to be able to code, or its a dilution of the term  a Growth Hacker who cant code at least a little is a Growth Strategist, still a highly valuable team member, but a different animal.<p>The reason this is so important is that in a startup environment, the team is always going to be maxing out their bandwidth. A Growth Hacker can hatch a new plan, and then start building it, bringing in other team members as theyre available.<p>A Growth Strategist on the other hand is utterly at the mercy of the other members of their team  if everyone is super busy (and they will be) new growth hacks can take forever to be enacted, and that can spell death for a startup.<p>I totally agree that the SEO skillset overlaps with growth hacking, but I think its a mistake to equate them 1:1  any SEO worth his salt stands partway down the yellow brick road that leads to Growth Hackerdom, but there are many leagues to go before we reach the emerald city.",1354041886

Some are receptive to reason, others are not.<p>I am working on what I think is an interesting project.  Next summer I hope to launch a local effort to start a tech summer camp for teenagers.  Of course, we will, among other things, teach programming.<p>They are going to start with C in the context of robotics.  I have been teaching my kid using the excellent RobotC from CMU.  This package hides some of the robotics sausage-making but it is still low-level enough to be very useful.  After that we might move them to real C with a small embedded project on something like a Microchip PIC or an 8051 derivative.<p>In fact, I am actually thinking really hard about the idea of teaching them microcode.  The raw concept would be to actually design a very simple 4 bit microprocessor with an equally simple ALU and sequencer.  The kids could then set the bit patterns in the instruction sequencer to create a set of simple machine language instructions.  This is very do-able if you keep it super-simple.  It is also really satisfying to see something like that actually execute code and work.  From that to understanding low-level constructs in C is a very easy step.<p>After C we would move to Java using the excellent GreenFoot framework.<p>So, the idea at this point would be Microcode -> RobotC -> full C -> Java.<p>Anyone interested in this please contact me privately.",1354041748

4838078,comment,4835581,4836393,3,0,bzbarsky,,,"Specifics: web browsers (and specifically Firefox, but it's true for WebKit-based browsers too) tend to be slower on most web workloads when running 64-bit.<p>There are several reasons for this.<p>First of all, web browsers are very pointer-chasing heavy because of the nature of web specs: the DOM is all about tree traversals, and so is CSS layout.  Further, you have to share style, font, etc data across objects to get anything resembling sane memory usage, which means chasing pointers to all that data.  Given that many of the algorithms involved require traversing large chunks of the DOM tree and various ancillary data structures, the upshot is that most of the really processing-intensive parts of a browser layout engine (possibly excluding graphics) are in fact more cache-bound than register-starved.<p>The second reason is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.  Since most of the users are running the 32-bit builds, the 32-bit JIT has had more optimization work on it than the 64-bit one.  The obvious solution is to improve the 64-bit JIT, of course.<p>The third reason is that even in JITTed code it turns out that cache locality matters a lot because JS objects share lots of their state across multiple objects so getting to it involves pointer-chasing.  An actual JSObject in SpiderMonkey is 4 pointers and all the other things you want out of an object you reach through those 4 pointers.  This reduces memory usage enormously compared to putting the data inline in the objects, and actually improves cache locality in general, but exacerbates the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit.<p>You're right that for heavily numeric JITted code x86-64 beats the pants off x86-32.  Unfortunately most JS out there is object-heavy pointer-chasing, not numeric code...",1354041605

I prefer to leave it off my resume because I like to address it myself in conversation (also I know who cares based on who asks), but honestly either way works. So long as your resume is not barren I do not think it is that big of a problem to leave it off.<p>As far as responding to their question, just be confident and direct. ""I left university because of X, and I do not plan to complete my degree at the time/until I do Y/whatever"". The reason you give will be a lot better than the possible reasons they might think up, so do not worry about it. There are many legit reasons for dropping out, including that it just was not for you, all they want to know is that you did not drop out because a personal flaw that may make you a bad employee. If you dodge the question, give a fishy response, or make too many excuses, it may seem like you have something to hide, and they will start speculating.<p>One last thing, do not put too much weight on this question. While I personally do not want to work for a company that has a strong degree bias either way (I left my last company, which I otherwise loved, on a sad note because of this), I do not think that this is that a definitive indicator that a company looks down on people without degrees. I have found that sometimes either someone who is not that technical and who's opinion is not that important (HR person or recruiter) is asking because they do not know better and are just compiling information for a higher up who did not specifically ask about your education, or sometimes an interviewer will ask it because they want to know how you will respond (whether you will be silly and apologize, or be confident in your skills, what's your view on education, etc). It is one of those questions where you can just say ""No, I did not graduate"" and it is not a big deal and you move on, or you can start to sweat, give a long winded excuse, and make your interviewer worry. If they do have a degree bias and do not hire your for that reason, well, then you dodged a bullet.",1354040832

I wouldn't count on the long-term stability of the US.<p><i>One of the main problems with Bitcoin from my perspective is that nothing backs its value</i><p>Nothing backs the value of gold, either. Come to think of it, I'm not sure the whole ""backing"" concept is <i>really</i> valid. I mean, yes, saying currency X is backed by metal Y is giving you useful info, but metal Y is always just a commodity.<p><i>the value is unregulated and purely arbitrary and thus subject to all kinds of manipulation and confidence tricks.</i><p>That's somewhat the case now becuase the market is pretty illiquid (bitcoin is only used by geeks). If/when the market is really liquid and the total value stored in bitcoin is enormous, that won't be the case anymore.<p><i>The current price depends entirely on confidence.</i><p>That bothers me too. But, ultimately, there will always be a demand to store value, and bitcoin is a good candidate, since there is a fixed number of them. If bitcoin were to become really big, whenever there were a price dip, speculators would jump in and bring it up again. And I think we've already reached that point to a large degree. It seems like there really is a floor on the value of bitcoin (and this will be increasingly true, and the floor will get increasingly higher, as bitcoin becomes more popular). You just aren't gonna see gold go down to $500/oz in current USD; nor are you going to see bitcoin go down to $3 (if it does, I and a ton of other people will be snapping it up as fast as possible... which is why it won't get there in the first place).<p>Actually, it could go down to (say) $3 if a big holder of bitcoins dumped them all suddenly and irraionally, since the market isn't that liquid, but there would be an immediate price correction, so it would just be a temporary blip.",1354040747

Steam does not place <i>ANY</i> limitations on what DRM a publisher can use.  They can use StarForce, they can come up with their own magic elixir, they can require you to send naked photos of yourself to the publisher for 'safekeeping' and Valve will permit it.  Steam has 1 guiding principle:  The Publisher is ALWAYS right.  The publisher must be able to do anything they wish, without any restrictions whatsoever.<p>Contrast this to a system like Apple's iTunes which set up a market with strict rules the publishers had to follow to join.  They HAD to sell songs individually.  They HAD to sell them for 99 cents a track.  They HAD to permit the user to burn them to CD.  Etc, etc, etc.  Steam does not have even one single ""have to"" when it comes to games publishers.  It is a publishers wonderland.<p>If you have lightweight DRM on Steam games, you have the games publishers to thank for that, not Valve.  Valve would not protect you from even the most extreme forms of DRM if a publisher wished to do it.  Valve even goes so far as to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars (possibly millions but I doubt it) to have their developers create features which enable publishers to make it look like they're embracing digital distro when they're not.  Case in point: the ability to download a game when its done... and then sit there and wait with it encrypted and complete on your hard drive, paid for... until physical retailers can get the game on their shelves.  And users think this is a feature!  It is a crippling of digital distro, which operates at light speed as opposed to the slow-as-molasses speed of physical distribution.  Valve didn't have to do this.  They could have said 'when you upload it to our servers, the customers who preordered it get the content available immediately', but they didn't, they followed the Golden Rule of Steam - The Publisher is ALWAYS right.",1354040458
4837934,comment,4834372,4834372,10,0,radarsat1,,,"I would like to propose that DRM is not intended to be uncrackable.  It's easy to convince yourself that DRM is flawed, because fundamentally it <i>is</i> a flawed tool.  Companies know this, they're not stupid.  However, DRM is actually not a technical tool to prevent piracy.  Rather, DRM is a <i>legal</i> tool to provide stronger <i>legal</i> arguments that theft has occurred.<p>I'm not saying this is <i>right</i>, necessarily, but I think companies know full well that their DRM scheme will be broken, so it's not really worth investing in an ""uncrackable"" and costly solution.  Instead, the role that DRM play is purely legal -- when the company does decide to go after someone for piracy, the DRM scheme, no matter how simple, provides them with the ability to say that the accused person ""broke a lock,"" rather than simply walking in through an unlocked door.  ""Entering"" vs. ""breaking and entering.""  It's nothing but legal leverage, and effective at that role even if it's not a very strong lock.<p>Of course, to have this argument hold, a company would never be able to admit that they purposefully implemented weak security -- this would be akin to admitting that their door was unlocked afterall, and would weaken their legal argument.  Therefore, there remains a niche in the market for solutions that <i>look</i> secure even if they fundamentally aren't.  It's all about lip service.",1354040457

For example, someone started a ""startup house"" in the first fiberhood to get hooked up, and is now renting it out to startup founders.

I want this. Code faster, sleep less.[2]<p>I kept trying to move objects a little bit without the double pump of first selecting. This makes tiny fly dropping lines which have to be undone or deleted. I think a short, brief gesture from the center of an object might be safely interpreted as a drag. You must already be deciding if it is a connection or a line. What's one more logic branch?[3]<p>I'd like to select several objects of a class and have the option to ""make same shape"" in order to tidy up. Say, grab 3 rectangles and make them the same dimensions. Easy context menu item, but you have to figure out how to select 3 arbitrary rectangles first. Perhaps in select mode a brief touch adds or removes from the set of selected objects?<p> For reshaping rectangles and ovals, I think a horizontal or vertical pinch should change just that dimension, diagonal can still resize preserving aspect ratio. This gives a natural way to change aspect ratio without all the mode-i-ness of the vertex.<p>I find myself wanting to connect more than 4 things to a rectangle, I want them to come in at right angles to a side, but not overlap their lines on the way in. That will take a day of thinking to imagine a solution to rendering that. Having them spaced pleasingly, near the center of the side, in an order to minimize crossovers would be lovely. Good luck.<p> I keep making fly specks on my drawing by touching the surface. I want that not to happen, but I suppose I might eventually want to make a tiny line too. Please resolve my ambiguous actions like an oracle. I expect this to be done so well I never realize you are doing it.<p> Xcode-esque snap to other stuff on the page would be nice, particularly snapping to ""things I am connected to"" would help keep those horizontal and vertical lines tidy.<p>I think adding ""shake to undo"" would be nice.

What does it take to get a job as a programmer? Next to nothing. After graduating with my computer science degree I've spent a few years working with the most incompetent people who were cooks, business graduates, poured concrete 2 months prior (you name it) and then decided to become programmers because they coded a formula in a spreadsheet.<p>I've spent some of the most agonizing hours unclusterfucking big bowls of pasta code with meatballs and all kinds of other shit all sprinkled with cheddar cheese. Then I had to hold their hands so that they wouldn't make such a stupid mistake again, and again and again. Then i left and you know what? These people still work there. This is exactly what this kind of thing encourages. It encourages coders, not software engineers/developers and it ends up hurting the industry more than helping it. Yes, you'll have some high school kids who'll like coding. They'll graduate from school and will be sucked into their first programming job right out of HIGH SCHOOL writing shitty code, making way more than their friends and making someone's life miserable. Then a small fraction of those kids will get better (some much better) and maybe get formal education, while the majority will remain damn coders. The industry allows this and it only gets worse. Look, we're not professionals by any formal definition of an engineering profession, but at least we can try to get there some freaking day. But it's incredibly hard to do when you have so much ""noise"" entering the work-force.

To date, I have written four educational/reference titles around a theme -- ""In 30 Minutes"". The idea is to let newbies quickly understand a mildly complex topic. The most recent title is  <i>The $10 Small Business Website In 30 Minutes</i> (1).<p>Not only do these books contain lots of screenshots and detailed TOCs, I also publish them in multiple formats -- .mobi, ePub, PDF, and PDF for paperback.<p>Unfortunately, I discovered that the most popular writing tools -- Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and Apple Pages, are not up to the task of creating ebook files across all of the platforms. Even if they can export to a certain format, there are limitations that force additional production and conversion steps. I also encountered the problem of forked masters, when I had to use different tools for exporting/converting to special formats.<p>Currently, I am using Google Docs for composition and collaboration with my copy editor. I then copy and paste the text into Scrivener (2), which is the most powerful writing and publishing tool I have ever used. It exports to .mobi, ePub, PDF, and print book PDF. Like TFA, I use Kindle Previewer to test the .mobi files. The ePub files need some mild HTML cleanup, which I do in Sigil (3).<p>1. <a href=""http://10dollarsmallbusinesswebsite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://10dollarsmallbusinesswebsite.com/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php</a><p>3: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/sigil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/sigil/</a>",1354039650

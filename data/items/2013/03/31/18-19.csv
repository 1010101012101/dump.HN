I've been chronicly ill for almost 5 years now and only recently did doctors find what's wrong with me and I'm starting to finally feel normal again. Long story short: Many lost opportunities and  0 in savings.<p>Before I was ill, I was programming since the age of 15. Being ill made it impossible to keep doing this so my knowledge has diminished to a basic level.. I know many things about coding but my pratical skills are too basic atm to search for a real programming job.<p>I want to devote most of my time to relearning programming. To do this I don't want a regular job, I want to be able to set my own schedule. So I'm looking for freelance jobs.<p>Unfortunalty, my skillset isn't that great without being able to program. When it comes to computers, I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. (at least for now)<p>So what can I do?\n- Basic scripting (python, applescript, javascript)\n- Translate from English into Dutch\n- Setting up a blog / site\n- Setting up a linux/windows server (only basic knowledge)\n- Do data entry\n- Do research\n- Also open to doing non-computer stuff\n- ...\nIf I could only earn between  750 -  1000 a month, I would be happy.<p>Two things HN can help me with:\n- If you're in need of some of the things mentioned above or something else you think I could do. My hourly rate is $20/15. Or we can agree on a fixed price. pm me.\n- If you have any other ideas how I can earn money without resorting to a regular job. I need money asap, not months from now so starting a business, (which I intend to do, but it takes time and money) isn't a viable option right now.<p>Yes, if push comes to shove I can always get a real job. But that would be a last resort measure and I rather avoid it!",1364756250

As a rural candidate, they offer to cover your expenses to attend. But...<p>Poor kid:\nNo one can help prepare you for the top-tier interview process! If you're lucky, a couple of your high-school teachers got doctorates from smaller universities. But have no idea on interview process. You worry about the interviews for weeks.<p>Rich kid:\nYou get a dedicated coach, who knows the school's interviewers names, styles, and preferred questions. You're prepared, practiced, and experienced in avoiding any rough patches. You feel confident.<p>Poor kid:\nYou're overwhelmed by the top-tier experience - everyone you met on the way, in the dorms, during the tour - was richer, smarter, better dressed. Many of them treat you with an odd kind of pity. You feel like an imposter.<p>Rich kid:\nYou're relaxed and at ease with your other interviewees. They are your sort of people. There are a few ""farm boys"", and you're curious about them, but you know they're probably not going to make it, and if they did, how could they afford to stay!? You're getting a good feeling about this place.<p>Poor kid:\nIn the interview you're stuck when they ask about your outside interests... you work at weekends, and study in the evenings, along with helping out at home. Outside interests are hanging out with your friends, reading and riding your bike. You know this isn't very impressive, and this makes you feel tiny.<p>Rich kid:\nWhen your asked about your outside interests, you've been coached no to say too much. You have so much free time in evenings, weekends, and holidays - due to your parents hiring cleaners, etc. that you do an overwhelming amount of stuff. A chance to show off the community work that you do, inbetween being a state level competitor in <insert any sport>.<p>Poor kid:\nWhen you're asked where else you applied, you look at the interviewers a little blankly... you applied here and a bunch of 2nd tier colleges. Frankly you're ashamed to list off the 2nd tier colleges. The interviewer must have figured out by now - you are an imposter.<p>Rich kid:\nWhen you're asked where else you applied, you reel off a list of top schools, dropping references to alumni of these schools that you've met or worked with.<p>Poor kid:\nWhen you're asked to work through a problem with the interviewer, you don't know where to start... you've never worked 1-on-1 with a teacher/educator in your life! You were the smart kid in school who was left alone to get on with it. The closest thing you've done to this was when your parents wanted to know what you were working on... and you knew they were only asking to show interest... not because they would understand - neither of them having high-school diplomas. You do your best... but it was awkward, you barely said a thing. You're now sure you've flunked the interview, and basically, you just want to cry at how badly you've screwed up, all those people who believed in you who you've let down, why did no one prepare you for this ordeal! And there's another 2 people lined up to speak to you today??!?!?!?!?<p>Rich kid:\nWhen you're asked to work through a problem, this is something you've done 1000s of times with your after school tutors, your AP class teachers, and most recently the interview coach. You jump at the chance to show off your knowledge. The interview is going well so far, all the weeks of preparation are paying off.<p>OK. So this wasn't quite me, but leans heavily on my personal experience, coming from a household with no high-school diplomas, a below average household income, and a school which, to their credit, pushed me to apply to a top tier university.

They were smart, the worked hard, and boom they are both ""successful.""<p>The comment about the military and its recruitment was also interesting. Because having been a military brat (the child of a military officer) it was clear that the military got their leadership from a wide swath of participants, not ""just"" folks from the military academies, one of my friend's dad was a general (1 star) and he always let us know he enlisted as an airman because his Mom couldn't afford to feed him as a teenager.<p>So the conclusion is that there isn't really a problem here. People who have the talent and motivation can get a good graduate degree from a good school. They need only finish their undergraduate degree at a state school. All the angst about Google or Facebook only hiring if you went to one of ""these"" 21 schools, is moot if you can get a masters degree there after you graduate from your ""loser"" school.<p>So I see the argument that the Ivy League won't even <i>see</i> you if you don't come through the right schools as an undergraduate, and <i>that doesn't matter</i> for anyone who gets an advanced degree. So if you have the talent get an advanced degree, it doesn't matter.<p>That said, it implies that if you are a loser and by the luck of having a wealthy family who shepherds you through the process so that you end up in an Ivy League school, you may find it easier to get hired as an undergraduate.

Coursera has a couple of self-paced classes, I believe, and I wish that more of the courses had that option.<p>I think the majority of MOOC course developers want to run their online courses as closely to their university versions as possible, since that's what they're used to working with. It also provides a handy way for them to go off-duty, in a sense, if the course has a finite end date. Using their current pacing structure (which is incredibly difficult, as the OP points out, for people that aren't full-time students) allows the teachers to do something other than devote themselves solely to the course, assuming they don't want to just post an archive and leave it alone -- which would meet a lot of people's needs, but misses the whole teacher-student interaction, which is pretty much missing from MOOCs anyway. If they want to provide an environment that's like a classroom, with students interacting with the instructors and with each other, you kind of need everybody at the same pace. It would be nice for us if they could slow that pace down, but that would probably increase the workload for the instructors.<p>We're still early in this game. I'm glad that so many professors have been willing to invest the time into developing the courses, and I understand why they are currently set up to be conveniently structured for <i>them</i>.

The idea of synchronous learning, where you have five thousand teachers teaching the same Calculus I class every year, is predicated on a world where these technologies don't exist.<p>As an aside, for this reason I think the collegiate model is going to completely change in the near future as people start realizing how absurd it is. The real value professors provide is having someone to answer questions (and in a lot of cases, professors don't even take questions during lecture). And even that functionality can and is (in my experience) mostly replaced by other students in the class or students who have already taken the class.<p>Put the material up, and let communities form around it. I don't need the professor to answer my questions, all I need is the relevant forum (in the original sense) to ask.",1364753609

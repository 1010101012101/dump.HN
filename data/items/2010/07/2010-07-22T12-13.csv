for the past few months and we think we've discovered the right product to wrap our idea into. 
The quickest description of what we're building goes ""Pandora meets Evernote for RSS"", 
or if you're not into that sort of analogies, it's a personalised newspaper-ish thing that lets 
you to process all the RSS feeds you're following.<p>Anyhow, onward to my question. Our past experience has shown that getting quality alpha/beta testers
is very difficult, so this time 'round we have promised to lend everyone who applies an iPad for a few days 
and on our launch at the end of the summer our ""favourite"" tester gets to keep the iPad.<p>But since iPads don't come cheap, how can we make the best out of the whole experience? I was thinking
about setting up a programme where the testers have to bring the device in every evening to be updated
with the new daily build and while we're upgrading the app, the tester answers a survey about their experiences
and so on.<p>Is that a good way to do this, or do better ways exist? More important still, how would one
go about designing good questionnaires? What sort of things should we be on the look out for? How can we
make sure the users answer even those questions we didn't think of asking etc.?<p>Thanks for the help,

I.e. qsort() calls lots of times, then returns and never refers to the object again; libevent functions may cause any number of calls (including zero, if the event is deleted); if you have a function pointer void (<i>put)(int key, void </i>value, void (<i>cb)(void </i>cb_arg), void *cb_arg) to store data, it may either call back before returning (e.g. data is stored in memory) or after (e.g. data is stored on a slow disk), or even call back multiple times (to provide progress reports). I see no way to handle this in a sane fashion.<p>4. If you are going to need threads by default (e.g. for your GC thread) you are breaking lots of UNIX, notably fork(), and require far too much infrastructure for some kernel/embedded programming. Yes, a good concurrency story is needed, but your program should be able to run without threads.",1279800728

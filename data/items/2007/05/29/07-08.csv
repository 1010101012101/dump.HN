Mostly I just want to learn the API and I think that being able to link into an existing social framework provides great benefits.  There is a definite trade off when it comes to doing something solely for Facebook and I'll be interested to see if it pays off.<p>At my current rate I should have a beta that people can try out in two or three days.  I'll post something here to get feedback, comments, and hopefully users when that happens :)",1180424554

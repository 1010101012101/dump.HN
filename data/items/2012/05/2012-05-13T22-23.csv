Well, none of the existing versioning models work well with law documents, especially acts. The general ideas do apply, but many of the details do not. For example, just think of a merge conflict: who are you so solve a merge a conflict? What you have to do is to just record the conflict and create two parallel universes, one in which the conflict has been resolved using branch A and another one in which the conflict is resolved using branch B. You then keep these two universes alive and apply all the later changes twice. You have to do this until a judge or a legal body declares one of the ""branches"" the correct one; this may take years and the decision reverted (even partially) many times.<p>A few links to relevant standards and systems:<p>* Legal XML: <a href=""http://www.legalxml.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legalxml.org/</a> An OASIS working group that is merging all the relevant national standards into a worldwide standard.

There's an interesting problem there, even if the application is macroscopically boring. If someone has a genuinely boring job (as opposed to an ill-matched job, or possibly a job not worth doing) then that indicates a lack of automation-- perhaps the programmer's fault (he's not skilled or courageous enough to do it) and possibly a manager's fault (for not budgeting time to do things properly).<p>That, I think, is the hardest thing about managing programmers, in which I include the increasingly important long-term job of managing one's own career. There are very few macroscopic indicators of what work is actually interesting (and more importantly, what projects fit which individuals).<p>If you asked me, at age 19 when I knew very little about software, whether it'd be more interesting to work on a game or work on an OS or a compiler, I'd have said the game based on the project's macroscopic attractiveness. Of course, most experienced programmers would prefer to work on the OS. If you're trying to hammer some C++ legacy garbage from another project into usefulness, the fact that it's ""for a game"" doesn't mean very much.<p>What I actually find is that there's only a very slight correlation between macroscopic and day-to-day ""interestingness"" in work (which is why it's so hard for managers to tell which projects are interesting). More important is the work environment-- whether you have the autonomy and creative control to solve problems in a decent way and make the work interesting.",1336946829

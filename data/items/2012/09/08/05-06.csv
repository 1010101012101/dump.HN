4492356,comment,4490875,4492073,5,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I agree. This is needed. Many people are missing the point, which is that there is no real government in those places. The fact that the entrenched powers are warlords and oligarchs means the gating and exploitation angle people are worrying about already exists in an even worse and more dishonest form.  Any such experiment could not possibly make things more broken than they are. That things have settled at such a dismal equilibrium is why so much aid is needed in the first place. Sending aid is attacking the symptom and not the disease.<p>Something like this would be like a culture attack in Civilization. It would show that something better was possible and not an ocean away, completely destabilizing the status quo. I am not surprised so many African leaders denied it - they would not try something that has such a high risk of eroding their power base and the iron hold hold they have  over the path of revenue.<p>Will this work? Well it either will or it won't. If it doesn't then things are no worse beyond a few bitter people. And if it does? The implications extend beyond Poor countries if the richer ones all of a sudden have to start competing for the  flow of talent. If they run slightly different versions in different areas they can even do some optimization on the best features of an economy and government.

4492328,comment,4491554,4491946,20,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I had a partner at a VC ask me that too :-) The question you have to ask is ""What is Flash?"" which sounds really dumb when you ask it but let me explain.<p>So in the storage business everything used to be done on the highest performance, most reliable drives. Typically those were 15K RPM Fibre Channel drives which cost 8x the price of an equivalent SATA drive [1]. In 2003 NetApp created the 'NearStore' line which was filers that used SATA drives. The idea was that tape was way to slow, you could put stuff on SATA drives and for low duty cycles get to it a lot faster, SATA drives were 'nearline' storage which was defined to be ""about 99.8% available."" This was hugely better than tape but not as good as a ""real"" disk array. Of course what people discovered was that you could have some pretty huge data sets be reasonably accessible that way, the first folks were the oil and gas folks [2] but lots of people jumped onto the bandwagon, it was cheaper than a storage array, faster than tape.<p>Now lets look at flash. Most people think of flash as a disk replacement because it connects to the computer through a disk interface (even though it doesn't have disk mechanicals). So it seems like a really fast disk. My assertion though is that it isn't a fast disk, its slow memory. It is 'near line' memory. Which is to say it takes a lot longer to access something in flash than it does in memory, but its craploads faster than getting off of spinning rust.<p>Four years ago, I told a guy who claimed to be Intel's key flash architect that if Intel would put flash on the same side of the MMU as the processor we would completely change the way servers are built. Why? Can you imagine that you've got 200GB of address space that is already ready to go when you turn on the processor? Once you start loading page tables you read in the ones in non-volatile flash and <i>blam</i> all your data structures are ready to go, right now. You want to make some sort of logical computation based on the state of a 50GB data structure, and all you do is follow the pointers? The 'driver' for flash attached as memory is<p><pre><code>   var = *((var type *)(0xsome64bitaddress);\n</code></pre>\nBut we cannot do that because flash doesn't live on the front side bus, it lives, at best, in the PCI Express address space on the other side of the Southbridge. [3].<p>Bottom line Solid State drives are doomed, you can't make them much denser the physics doesn't work, you don't want to waste your time going through the disk driver and I/O subsystem to get to what is essentially more memory. But as flash moves closer to the CPU its impact will become pretty impressive.<p>[1] This lead people like IBM to propose 'bricks' which were 8 SATA drives in a RAID or Mirrored config pretending to be a single reliable drive.<p>[2] One of my favorite Dave Hitz quotes: ""Oil and Gas companies have an <i>awesome</i> compression algorithm, they can take a 600TB data set and compress it to one bit, 'oil' or 'no oil.'""<p>[3] Yes the new Sandy Bridge DDIO architecture helps with this.

I'm not saying other types of leaders don't have to talk, but I just wish people could grasp that a developer ships software by sitting and working at a computer for a very long time, sometimes up to 12 hours a day.  Doing social visits and meetings is time that a dev is not delivering.  If a developer stops developing software so they can spend the majority of his or her time with face-to-face visits and meetings, that person is no longer working in a developer role.<p>No one seems to believe this, but developers have to develop software at some point.  There is no way around it, no one else is going to write the code, make the tests, etc.  In the business world unfortunately, people drop out development but keep calling themselves developers.

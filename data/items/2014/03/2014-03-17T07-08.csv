If these pages aren&#x27;t changing frequently (particularly if they are outdated or shouldn&#x27;t be accessible), then Varnish should be able to cache and respond with them trivially. This will take a tremendous amount of load off of your actual app servers.<p>Additionally, Varnish has ACLs which make it possible to reject requests based on whatever patterns you choose (source IP, request structure, etc). While it puts you into an arms race, if you can identify a pattern in the bad traffic, you can short-circuit it before it ever becomes an actual problem. Black-holing poorly-behaved clients is very easy, and can let you absorb very high request concurrency with extremely little effort.<p>Varnish also makes it very easy to locate URLs and IPs being used in these sorts of things, via varnishtop and varnishlog. For example, `varnishlog -i RxURL` gets you a constantly-updated list of the URLs being hit most frequently, or `varnishlog -i SessionOpen` will get you a list of the most common client IPs.

If it is a lot of different IP addresses then that is a good sign of a DDOS attack of some kind.  If it is a lot of requests from the same IP address or only a few IP addresses it probably is a search engine or something like which is causing the problem.  You can also look up the IP addresses by simply Googling them to see who owns the IP.<p>To fight off the attack immediately I would recommend switching your DNS over to CloudFlare&#x27;s Pro or Business plan (that depends a lot though on your site&#x27;s current configuration, the size of your budget, etc.) with certain settings, then configuring Sucuri CloudProxy with CloudFlare, and lastly implementing some additional security for your server on Single Hop.<p>In terms of preventing future ones, you basically want to be proactive as possible in terms of preventing them, but that won&#x27;t stop everything.  The configuration I recommended above should be pretty good for most sites, but you might want to consider other DDOS mitigation companies as well and you could need something completely different depending on your business etc.  Then you want to have a plan and several other things in place in case it was to get past the infrastructure you implemented to prevent it, so you can minimize the downtime you have etc.<p>It is hard to tell whether that is a possible issue just based on the information you gave in terms of the sleeping MySQL connections.<p>Lastly, depending on what the issue exactly is, it probably would be a good idea to make your site as static as possible, but that is difficult to do since your site is down right now.  Once you get the site back up though and stable, you might consider doing this for a little bit.  Lastly, having a separate site that you can deploy in the event of an attack is a good idea as well.<p>If you want more help, shoot me an email at caleb.lane4@gmail.com.

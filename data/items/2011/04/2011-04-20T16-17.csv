2467323,comment,2465354,2467052,1,0,pstack,,,"Do you really think that the average person browsing iTunes realizes that there is a difference between the TWIT brand and all of the ""This Week In . . ."" stuff? Largely, they don't. I've spoken with people that didn't realize they were unrelated. There's a reason for trademark law. So that someone can't come in and do the same thing you're doing in the same market with an identical branding and stir up confusion and dilute your own business brand. I suppose the audience at TWiT may generally be savvy enough to recognize there is no relation, but the network also caters to a very large audience of laymen who can no more discern the two This Week In tech-related networks than they can discern ""The Internet"" from ""Internet Explorer"".<p>I've dealt with this, personally, when someone produced the exact same service as I had been providing for many years. They changed two letters in the name and that was it. For years afterward, there was great confusion among the audience and I had to deal with people emailing me to complain about problems with the other group that I had nothing to do with, because they didn't realize they were different. They filed reports about me, thinking that I was the other place. They would use my service and get upset that ""the site has changed"", because they didn't realize that they had been visiting ""the other"" site this whole time.<p>The only reason I couldn't do anything about it is because I'm just one guy and I don't have tens of thousands of dollars to spend on lawyers and legal processes or, believe me, I would have.<p>You might also notice that ""This Week In NASCAR"" would, of course, be about NASCAR. There is almost no concern about brand confusion or dilution when one is about technology and the other is about racing. There is, however, potential for brand confusion when one is primarily about technology and tech culture and the other is about technology and tech culture. And when one is distributed over the internet and iTunes and the other is distributed over the internet and iTunes.<p>It is a naming attempt made deliberately for confusion. You can't argue that it isn't, because any reasonable person starting a project would look at the naming conventions of similar services and products and say ""well, I don't want to be confused with this other one, so I want my name to be unique and very identifiable"".

After all, it would be pretty shitty for a major software company with tens of thousands of employees, many of whom are brilliant, and $2B per month in earnings, to be completely unable to deliver software that does not so imperil users that the general advice is for them to avoid using the products at all.  So, given its implications, I think the advice given by EFF is just outrageous.<p>Saying that IE and Outlook are difficult to secure is not in itself inflammatory, except when coupled with the general recommendation to avoid Microsoft.  ANY Internet-connected software is difficult to secure and audit, so why single out Microsoft?  Are the other vendors that much better?  I doubt it.  Can you show me some kind of real data demonstrating that products similar in functionality to the latest versions of IE and Outlook are truly less difficult to secure?<p>The argument that ""adversaries tend to attack popular platforms"" is common sense but not useful, and no more compelling than saying ""The vendor with the largest installed base, the most smart developers, and the most cash, will do the best job, over time, of securing their platform.""  In reality, the size of the user base, and the size of the company, provide nothing more than a rationale, as opposed to real information about the security of the platform.<p>So, in my opinion, EFF is not making a ""fair assessment.""<p>This is not you and me having a debate over beers at a bar.  This is the EFF saying, flat out, MS products are to be avoided, and one reason for that is their popularity.  For most people, this translates to, ""Use a Mac instead.  They are inherently more secure and less of a target because they aren't as popular.""  And while there are lots of great reasons to use a Mac, I think this line of thinking is flimsy.<p>Finally, the MS bashing fest is totally pervasive.  It's firmly in the zeitgeist right now, and I totally object to the herd mentality it demonstrates.  Last week there was a much-debated post on HN by a company indicating that an experienced .NET programmer is ""ruined"" and very unlikely to be a good programmer in general.<p>There are absolutely valid criticisms of Microsoft.

I agree with Rich in principle: a language's design should not say ""yes"" to everything, but I agree with Steve in some of the particulars.<p>After programming in Clojure for two weeks, I had a list of complaints about the language. It has now been two years, and nearly all of my objections went away as the language evolved and as I adapted to using it. Two years later, I just have two notable things to grumble about. Coincidentally, they seem to be closely related to Steve Yegge's concerns.<p>1. No condition system. This is a big deal. Clojure piggy-backs on Java's exceptions, and currently lacks a good mechanism for user-defined error handling. Unfortunately, Java exception handling also happens to suck, since it throws away data in all stack frames from the throw to the catch. Implementing better error handling is under discussion on the Clojure development page (<a href=""http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Error+Handling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Error+Handling</a>). (Steve complains about the lack of non-local transfer of control, and he has a point: it could be used to make an arbitrarily powerful condition system, see <a href=""http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Condition-Handling-2001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Condition-Handling-2001.h...</a>).<p>2. No built-in debugger. The way CL code doesn't just crash and throw away stack information is amazing. The lack of this feature in other languages is appalling.<p>In addition, I sort of agree that being forced to forward-declare things is annoying. I got used to it, but I don't really like the restriction. I do understand the reason behind it, though: auto-interning symbols in the reader (as Common Lisp does) can be confusing and occasionally problematic.",1303315479

A ""just say yes"" mindset is incredibly dangerous; yeah, ok, a trillion people use C++ but that doesn't make it a good language.  Clojure to date has been built with great discipline, and it would be <i>tragic</i> to see it go off those rails in the hopes of satisfying a huge mass-market that a) Clojure is fundamentally unsuited for and b) will never be happy regardless.  When I say that Clojure is fundamentally unsuited for a certain ""mass-market"" I don't mean that it shouldn't or won't catch on and into i.e., the TIOBE top 10 -- just that it can't be everything to everyone, and shouldn't try to be.  It's a wonderful language that understands what it tries to be, and I hope the Rich never forgets those underlying intuitions on (state, identity, functionalism).  Abandoning that discipline own't make it any more powerful, but will just muddy the language to try and satisfy people who won't be impressed because of it.",1303315464

They changed them to true OS threads somewhere along the way, which helps in multiprocessor situations, but I'd love to still have the green threads around as a tool.<p>I don't know enough about the JVM to have any idea how tricky it would be to hack it in; I suspect calling out into a C library that calls setcontext() is going to make the JVM rather unhappy.",1238147872

534884,comment,534667,534732,0,0,silencio,,,"Me too, but at a certain point when you are established in a way, you want to fly a small flag just to say ""hey look, it's possible!"" to other women.<p>When I was wee (oh god, I'm getting old?! but I'm only 20!) I was put off by how many men there were and how weird it was to be the only girl in my entire CS classes, and now I think I'm over most of it (except for the really hurtful/disgusting discrimination, not limited to tech or gender). However, I occasionally meet another woman or some girl barely a few years younger who was put off by gender discrimination in tech (in general, not just startups) permanently or was on the verge of doing so, and I try to get them interested again in one way or another by mentoring in a way. I think in that aspect it's worthwhile to attempt that at least. All the women I talk to about this have found it helpful to know that there are other women in the industry that have been successful and that not everyone is so rude.",1238147173
534883,comment,534330,534499,0,0,BvS,,,"What about buying socks when you are at a clothes shop anyway. Even if its only every two years, you could easily buy 20 pairs at once since you are hardly running the risk that they will be out of fashion next season.<p>Even rich people go to buy clothes themselves at last once every other year, don't they? Seems like less time in contrast to fill out an online form.",1238147145
534881,comment,534679,534679,0,0,berntb,,,"I think the banking crisis was milder in Sweden because of the handling of the crisis in the beginning of the 1990s. Then, the shareholders of the Swedish banks were hurt to save the banks, so the banks knew they would not get _free_ money from the state in the next crisis (which makes the banks a bit of an exception in Sweden, but that is another discussion.)<p>After reading the article, it seems both more complex and simpler than that. Really good.",1238147065

Then again, it could actually be a bug in their algorithm<p>Still, the issue is that Google provides no way of finding out the cause.",1238146952

534877,comment,534747,534747,0,0,davidw,,,"I was thinking that it would be a really cool hack to twiddle an open source Java vm to give it a scheduler like Erlang's, in order to not rely on threads.  It would not be a simple hack, but you could potentially do some very cool things with it.  Erlang style ""processes"" are much cheaper than threads.",1238146418
534876,comment,533782,534463,0,0,swombat,,,"I don't see what the level of writing has to do with whether one is an author or not. You're the author of your comment, and a graffiti artist who draws a penis on a wall is the author of that graffiti. Author merely implies who created the thing.<p>Anyway, all I was commenting is that I find it quite unpleasant when I write blog posts and people refer to me in the third person, as either ""the author"" or ""the blogger"", but between the two, ""the author"" seems less dismissive and I'd pick that over the other. It's worth keeping in mind that the author probably reads these comments too.",1238146161

I'll concede that CBA gives a false sense of accuracy.<p>You initially said ""I'm glad we didn't make a rational decision"", and I don't agree with that sentiment at all.  You are free to base your decisions on your morals and ethics, but when it comes to something as global as global warming I'm not sure you can just force them onto the rest of us.",1238144875

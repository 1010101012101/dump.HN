But it has to be supported by the dvm. Same with .NET IL.<p>My point being, that if your language isn't the main one, you'll be a second class citizen. Now, if accept the current apple line (not that I do), that the restriction is because of their multitasking requirements, you can see how either Microsoft of Android could implement similar restrictions.

Users are happy right now, but the time line of returns is significant.

Open systems are often a dog to get working, but once you do you find the capability continues to pay dividends.<p>- Visual basic lets you create apps quickly but there's a lot of things you can't do, and your platform might be taken away from you.<p>- Microsoft word allows anyone to create small, well-formatted document with low training. But there's tooling lock-in, it's unwieldy to have many people work on documents, it's hard to transform your data.<p>- Iphone lets you get easy access to music and apps. But they won't transfer forever; long-term upgrade options are even more complicated than in consulting software because Apple would need to participate in maintenance.<p>Something we've seen with open platforms is that they move slowly but rarely lose ground.

1255013,story,,,1,2,sahueso,"Concurrency Combination",,"I decided to learn concurrency and wanted to find out in how many ways machine instructions from two different threads/processes could overlap in a theoretical setting where they are executed linearly. The code for both processes is a 10 iteration loop with 3 instructions performed in each iteration. I figured out the problem consisted of leaving X instructions fixed and then fit the other X instructions from the other process between the spaces taking into account that they must be ordered (eg.instruction 4 of process B must always come before instruction 20).<p>I wrote a program to count this number, looking at the results I found out that the solution is n Combination k, where k is the number of instructions executed throughout the whole life of one process, so for 10 iterations it would be 30, and n is nÂº instructions * 2 (2 processes), 60. In other words, the problem is the same as having n number of objects with n/2 fixed and having to fit n/2 among the spaces without the latter n/2 losing their order.<p>I have no idea why n C k works, I understand that the definition of a combination is, in how many ways can you take k elements from a group of n elements such that all the groups are different but the order in which you take the elements doesn't matter. In this case we have n elements and we are actually taking them all, because all the instructions are executed, so I don't see how it can be a combination where we are taking only k instructions from this set of size n, leaving the other k without being executed.<p>Could someone please explain to me how it works?<p>Thanks in advance.",1270906908

That was a visual approach with almost zero visibility.<p>These aircraft are old, but have received extensive maintenance and upgrades, so a mechanical failure isn't likely. What you have to remember, though, is that a Tu-154 does not climb as well as a modern jet. So an aborted landing is much more dangerous, as you don't have enough engine power to climb quickly.<p>The pilot made four landing attempts (these are the best of pilots, so I suspect he was told to), the last one being fatal. Also, I don't expect a sane pilot to try to make a turn at low altitude right after an aborted landing, so the stories about the plane being in a turn probably mean the plane was already in a stall and falling.<p>Also, the runway at this airport is very short for the Tu-154 even at the best of times, so the pilot would have to touch down at the very beginning of the runway.

If the Telcos want to open their eyes instead, they might find they have a lot more to lose than to gain. Ditching Net Neutrality will cost them a whole lot more than it will gain them, as soon as content providers realise that actually, the providers should be paying them, not the other way around.<p>I mean, if Telefonica wants to block access to youtube, why should Google stop them? Fine. Block it. And lose 80% of your customers overnight. If Google wanted to play this game, they should be asking Telefonica to pay <i>them</i> money.<p>It's not a long step from this to having bloggers, newspapers, etc, organise in collectives that can charge telcos for ""access to every newspaper on the web"" or ""every blog on the web"".",1270904582

Moreover too many people died in this accident and any justified suspicions might lead to war. The fact it happened in Russia don't make it's not coincidence.

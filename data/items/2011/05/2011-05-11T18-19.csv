sign up for an account for free.. and start finding jobs in the facebook and php categories..<p>In a single month, I made around $3000 from projects there..<p>If it works for you, you can then subscribe for a $25 monthly fee, which will reduce the fees they charge you from 10% to 3% only!<p>Start bidding with low prices at first.. just look at other bids, and see what is the average, and bid lower than the average with 5% to 10%.<p>This will help you in getting reviews and reputation quickly... and then you can start increasing your bids accordingly!<p>When you bid on a project, YOU MUST send a private message to the employer, explaining how you can do the job, and take a little bit about your great experience... and ask the employer to contact you, and ask you any questions needed.<p>Without sending a private message to the employer, your chances to get the job will be very low indeed!<p>Good luck for you, and if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.

2537845,comment,2526622,2532899,1,0,dmfdmf,,,"Re P1: Jaynes presented his work as a method for science and engineering but throughout his work stated that the method was general. AR said that mathematics is an abstracted form of conceptualization and logic which is why she was studying higher math to understand induction. Jaynes was not an epistemologist (nor an Objectivist) so the failure to distinguish or explain the exact relation between ""A is A"" from ""A = A"" is understandable especially in light of his explicit goal of targeting science and engineering. I did not claim that Jaynes solved the problem of induction nor that his theories were perfect, just that I think he was on the right track and made some significant contributions.<p>Re P2: Jaynes' claim was that the laws of probability reduce to Aristotelian rules of deductive logic when the Pr=1. I do not agree that this makes logic subordinate to a mathematical process -- no more than AR's theory of concepts makes concept formation subordinate to algebra. In any case, the claim is mathematically true (given Jaynes' system which I admit may need revision) but it is also a fact that deduction is dependent on induction which is consistent. So to clarify the exact relations (without violating identity or inverting hierarchy, etc) requires AR's theory of concepts which Jaynes did not have. Moreover, to define the principles of when it is valid (without enumerating all cases) to go from Pr<1 to Pr=1 IS the problem of induction which Jaynes did not specifically address.<p>Re P3: Jaynes completely rejects the the counting and ratio arguments for induction. Unfortunately he flips over to the subjectivist and vague ""degrees of belief"" view of probability and is unable to define it (which is why he needed a theory of concepts). This failure is hardly surprising given that every field today is split on intrinsic versus subjectivist premises.",1305140239

I doubt, though, that not requiring bonding for a money-transfer startup will cause the deaths of 1000 people. As to businesses generally, tort lawyers as a class make a pretty good living holding businesses accountable. The Ford/Firestone controversy comes to mind. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controv...</a>) In that controversy plaintiffs suing Firestone and Ford alleged that people died because tire failure caused rollover accidents in Ford Explorer SUVs. As a result, both Ford (maker of the vehicle with the defective tires) and Firestone (maker of the tires) had to pay a lot money and their stock price suffered. Also, one of Firestone's tire manufacturing plants was closed and Ford and Firestone no longer do business together. So there are consequences when private companies screw up.<p>On the other hand, when government screws up and thousands of lives are lost, like when it holds up the sale of a new drug, fails to defend the airspace against terrorist attacks, or goes to war on bad intelligence, there don't seem to be consequences.",1305140174

Firstly, tying two APIs together with a smart client is a freaking great idea, although if this were a for-profit project, you should probably worry about either one locking you out, and how long it would take to notice oddities and rewrite if one or the other changes its API overnight.<p>In a broader way though, I'm really interested in the idea of using client-side processing for infinite scalability. Even/especially in secure apps, where no hacker's gone before. There's no reason a secure P2P protocol can't be developed in JS that lets an application layer ride between peers, having minimal interaction with any central servers.

You start with an AST whose leaves are of type String (identifiers). You want to slot in something else, like pointers to a link table, or values, etc. Maybe some identifiers are builtins which will modify the AST, or user-defined macros, so the transformation will be non-trivial.<p>In a static language, this transformation would be typed as `AST Identifier -> AST Value`, or the like. This guarantees that you haven't missed any identifiers.<p>The guarantees provided by static typing tend to be somewhat orthogonal to the guarantees provided by testing. Testing ensures that, in some particular cases, the function works exactly as it should. Types ensure that, in <i>every</i> case, the function satisfies some properties that it should. The ideal would be every case and every property, but this is only possible with complete proofs.<p>In my experience, types catch more bugs with less effort than tests.",1305139542

It doesn't matter if I buy petroleum from maker A or maker B, because both are, to the extent that I care, petroleum.

The phrase 'follow the money' works because such activities are at their heart economic in nature (trying to enrich the criminals) and understanding the path to that enrichment often allows law enforcement to disassemble the criminal enterprise behind it.<p>That being said, I would not be the least bit surprised (although I did not read through any floor debate if there was any) if the people who voted for this law did so believing that they were addressing a great threat to society, which is the proliferation of payment processors which are not accountable to the state for tracking or even reporting their transactions in any form.<p>That does cut into 'innovation' as thinkcomp points out but it doesn't preclude it. It changes the conversation from 'build it and see what works' to something more along the lines of a slow plod from idea to implementation while bringing legislators and law enforement along.

In particular, the speaker mentions that older codes have failed to keep up with better techniques for strawbale building.<p>The deeper issue is not whether new materials can be used to meet code requirements, but whether new ideas of what constitutes a safe dwelling are allowed. Building codes are based on assumptions about what a dwelling should be like. For example, the floor should be relatively stiff. If a floor is too bouncy, it won't meet code even if it's strong enough to support the weight. Walls can't be too flimsy. The idea of a house that just safely collapses in a windstorm or floats away in a flood is, I suspect, outside of most building codes' conception of a safe building. The code focuses on the idea of a strong, permanent structure that will resist nature's forces. If houses were plants, the code would only recognize big trees. However, there are also grasses, which much cheaper to produce and also resistant to nature's forces in their own way (they bend). Yet building codes don't recognize structures that are inspired by grasses, only big immovable trees.<p>I don't know if grass-like houses are a good idea or not, but I'm sure that if we expand our thinking we can come up with better shelters. The problem is that it's hard to innovate and government regulation only tends to make it harder.",1305137932

So I'll explain my reasoning for invoking Gdel.<p>I mostly wanted to walk around the historical event I mentioned, the breaking of the Hilbert Program. At the time, it seemed that formal specification of math would provide a complete picture of what math was! Once the Program was finished then the job of mathematician would eke out into ""computer"" (of the abacus sort) or into other fields which interpreted the canon.<p>I'm not sure which death stroke was stronger, the incredible opaqueness and complexity of proof systems like ZFC or Gdel just saying what he was trying was outright impossible, but Hilbert's Program was killed before it even seriously took off, leaving the study of mathematics and the practical formalisms we use to study it pretty ad-hoc instead of grand and unified.<p>I'm unifying that with the fact that the way math seems to be practiced never comes from the formal language but instead first comes from imagining some kind of ""mathematical object"" and then taming its behavior with formalisms. You could consider them to be one and the same and argue that the difference is highly philosophical, and then this is where I'd invoke Gdel and inform you that there definitely exist things we could benefit from reasoning about that your formal language would fail to describe. This existence proof separates the classes of true things and provable things and makes their distinction more than philosophical.<p>Now, talking about what a ""mathematical object"" is gets you to the bleeding heart of the philosophy of science and epistemology. It's a tough question!<p>---<p>As a final note, ZFC is ZF + Axiom of Choice... which, yes, most practicing mathematicians just accept AoC so that they can integrate or whatever. The formal world without AoC is very sparse, <i>but</i> nobody has any sort of idea what the arbitrary decision means. I know that there has been some significant study of ZF-C, though it's been ""impractical"", I don't know if anyone is willing or capable of stating that ZF-C is in any way worse than ZFC. Impractical is a Mathematicians favorite adjective, so they're just two extant formal systems which disagree quite a lot on important things but we mostly pay attention to ZFC.",1305137059

Too many limitations, with virtually no big upside functionality or user experience (unlike the iPad that makes up for limitations with some huge upside).<p>As I'd mentioned before I can buy an ASUS Eee PC with an AMD C30 processor for $289 and be able to use the browser of my choice, sync my iPod/iPad/iPhone, play WoW, use Skype, hook it up to my TV in the dorm, use MS Office, Visual Studio, emacs, vim, etc...<p>It just feels like a half-baked implementation.  The price point on this needs to be a LOT cheaper.  Like $100 or free for a netbook, and make the money up with targeted advertising based on them being locked into Chrome.

2038916,comment,2038392,2038576,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Erlang syntax is derived from Prolog syntax, sure, but with several extra operators and heavy operator overloading. Prolog syntax is cleaner.<p>The "";"" vs ""."" thing is also on Erlang. Prolog has a function to read the next clause (much like Lisp's read parses the next sexp), and Prolog clauses end in ""."". The Erlang interpreter seems to have been implemented so it read every alternative for a pattern in one step, so it ended all except the last with "";"". "";"" is Prolog's ""or"" operator, "","" is ""and"". Prolog just ends every pattern with ""."".<p>That said, you get over those minor syntactic issues pretty quickly, and I'll take a language with ugly syntax but beautiful semantics over one with ugly semantics any day.",1293284915

2038914,comment,2038220,2038619,0,0,rdl,,,"There are cases where a relatively maintenance free power source which can be installed a point of use is worth a lot more than you'd think -- it's basically like a primary battery cell -- a way to transport energy.  It doesn't matter if it's less than unity efficient in recovering the power used to make it, if distribution and storage costs for that power would otherwise be really high.<p>On cellphone towers in the middle of nowhere with no wirelines linking them, a solar panel makes a lot of sense, even if it never recovers as much power as it cost to build.  Or on a satellite.  Or, apparently, on a shack in rural Africa.<p>I agree Africa probably could do better with natural gas, oil, hydro, or coal central plants for now, vs. big solar plants, but a combination of cheap big grid power sources and decentralized renewables seems like the best solution.  Building out a grid in rural areas isn't really cost effective.",1293284689

2038911,comment,2038079,2038575,0,0,ljlolel,,,"She specifically says to go with slow disk I/O (not in-memory indices) because the most important thing is not to have to deal with failing servers.<p>This was written in 2004, and the equivalent statement would be that you should not deal with maintaining physical servers but have the cloud handle it so you can focus on algorithms/parallelism/runtime.<p>Also, unrelated to what you wrote, this is 2004, and statements like ""people search for words not phrases"" are frankly no longer true.  Average query length is way up (even before google suggest and instant) and people have been searching for phrases more and more since 2004.<p>She's completely right, but if she were to rewrite this today, in 2010, it would be an even longer article.

I passed on a job in Stockholm doing Erlang ten years ago because Erlang seemed like a very small niche, even if the platform does make some otherwise very difficult things easy.<p>It was kind of sad, actually, to hear Jonas Boner talk about Erlang at one of the Bay Area Scala group meetings.

2038897,comment,2038108,2038108,0,0,Xurinos,,,"I respect the author's directions -- and Clojure is a fine language -- but I was a little put off by this assertion:<p><i>I’m only really getting at the fact that even the ultra-flexible of Common Lisp wasn’t written to handle all computing scenarios.</i><p>This came after he noted that Lisp includes destructive functions and implementation-specific multithread schemes.  Sure, on the one hand, the CL standard is a little long in the tooth, but on the other hand...<p>(1) ""Pure functional"" is less flexible than ""functional plus features for imperative programming"".  It was weird that he cited destructive, efficient functions as a negative, that they contributed to Lisp not supporting ""all computing scenarios"".  We can happily debate functional approaches as being less bug-ridden and all that jazz, and those advantages come with the tradeoff of being less flexible.<p>(2) A Turing-complete language supports all computing scenarios.<p>(3) Okay, sure, you want access to some OS services, not just academic completeness, and that does end up being implementation-specific.  Fortunately, CL gives us an out: you can implement layers that detect the implementations and do whatever specific thing was provided.  Every modern CL implementation supports multithreading in one form or another.  There are several packages contributed by Lispers that show different approaches to multithreaded and multiprocessing apps.  There is no one true way with that.  Clojure provides several approaches, and there are several libraries for Lisp that provide several approaches.<p>Over Clojure, CL continues to provide some advantages, at least to me... Less syntax; compiles to machine code; mature; no special functions required for recursion, recursive iteration, or trampolining; and not limited by the JVM.  A couple of those end up being Clojure's advantages, too, depending on your perspective (syntax, JVM).<p>Both fine languages.  Just a weird comment in the middle of a good essay.",1293283018

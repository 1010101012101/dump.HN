I'm bad with sequences and I have a volatile short term memory which means I make mistakes and am slow to process numbers and logic. Interestingly these flaws cause me abhor any over complex logic or code where you have to remember more than 4 or 5 things at once to use properly, which makes my code clean. So maybe I'm not a good programmer (I can't write the complex stuff very easily) but the code I write is usually good.

1039380,comment,1037993,1038450,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello, VM is already in alpha on Git actually. There is some more work to do, but I don't think in the Reddit use case there is the need of Redis VM: they are using MemcacheDB as a persistent cache, if it's a cache it should match very high performances delivered by memcached and is not required to cache everything. Redis is as fast or faster than memcached (using clients with the same performances) and is persistent, so probably it's a good fit for this problem.<p>Instead of VM Reddit should use Redis EXPIRE I guess, that is, time to live in cached keys so they auto expire.<p>Btw for people that don't know what Redis Virtual Memory is: with VM Redis is able to swap out rarely used keys in disk. This makes a lot of sense when using Redis as a DB. When using Redis as a cache, the way to go is EXPIRE: rarely used things in cache should simply <i>go away</i> and be expired instead of being moved into disk.<p>EDIT: It would be very interesting to know where the Reddit performance problem is, but Redis Sorted Sets are a very good match to create social-news alike sites like HN or Reddit in a scalable distributed way, with a few workers processing recent news to update their score into the sorted set. The home page can be generated with ZREVRANGE without any computation.<p>It's a shame reddit is not sharing how this cache is used.",1262954613
1039379,comment,1039066,1039066,0,0,gjm11,,,"The title is rather misleading (not the submitter's fault -- it's the title of the original post). It's not ""array comparison that's independent of timing"", whatever that might have meant, it's ""array comparison whose timing is independent of the contents of they arrays"". (To avoid side-channel attacks on your crypto.)<p>I think there's an oversimplification in the first section, though it may be a deliberate one for the sake of clarity. Your goal isn't really to know each byte with 95% confidence, it's to know enough about the bits that you can do a small search and be likely to find the right key / hash / whatever. Which means that what you really want to do is to have a model of how the timings (noise and all) relate to the actual values, and keep going until the <i>total entropy</i> of the secret you're trying to extract gets small enough.",1262954580

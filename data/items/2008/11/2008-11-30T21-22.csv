next week take out 500 Balance is now 14,500<p>and so on.<p>'will be more useful than more debt juggling.' 
it's not juggling debt it's minimising you're costs. Not minimising your costs is the difference between having enough cash to be a startup for another 6 monts or not<p>30,000 @ 20% interest = $6,000 p/a
30,000 @ 3% interest = $900 p/a<p>To maintain the 30,000 debt on a card you'd have to come up with 6,000 a year if it's a personal loan it costs you $900 a year - so fo a couple of phone calls you can change your costs by more than $5,000.<p>'I would be cautious about falsifying a credit application.'

381125,comment,380681,380881,0,0,gruseom,,,"There's very little to it. As I said, sometimes a function is only a function. I'm wary of providing an example, because the discourse on programming languages is distorted by being conducted at the level of code snippets when what really matters is whole systems, which are harder to talk about. But since you asked, I went through my code and picked at random the first reasonable example of what I'm talking about:<p><pre><code>  (defun ranges-intersect? (range1 range2)
    (destructuring-bind (c1 c2 r1 r2)
        range1
      (destructuring-bind (xc1 xc2 xr1 xr2)
	  range2
        (return%
         (and (or (= c1 0) (= xc2 0) (> xc2 c1))
	      (or (= c2 0) (= xc1 0) (> c2 xc1))
	      (or (= r1 0) (= xr2 0) (> xr2 r1))
	      (or (= r2 0) (= xr1 0) (> r2 xr1)))))))
</code></pre>
(The ugly return% is because this code also compiles to Javascript, but that is another story.)<p>See? It's just a function. In the past, I would have made a Range class with an Intersects method. Now, I don't, and my life is better.<p>What's valuable is that this function isn't tied to other functions and it isn't tied to any state. That's what I mean by orthogonal. If I want to use this somewhere, I just use it. I'm not forced to pick up a whole glob of other stuff that's stuck to it. I'm not forced to create anything in order to call it - except a couple of lists of four numbers, if I don't have them handy, but this kind of thing is an order of magnitude more lightweight than defining specialized types and creating instances of them; especially since, if your object model is a rich one, your types inevitably reference other types, which makes creating things hard and forces you to jump through hoops just to get at one lousy function. Eventually people create entire technical disciplines called things like ""dependency injection"" and frameworks to jump through the hoops for them. No one seems to notice that they're taking a complicated thing and making it more complicated.<p>You may object that writing ""new Range(c1,c2,r1,r2)"" isn't much different than ""(list c1 c2 r1 r2)"". All I can say is, yes it is, utterly different in a way that has profound implications for how I build programs - but this isn't the sort of thing that a code snippet can make clear.<p>What's really going on here, I think, is that ""functional programming"" is just a tautology. No one has programmed without functions since the 1950s (assembly language excepted). But the facilities for defining functions were low-level for a long time, which made complex programs hard to write. One way of looking at OO is that it was an attempt to fix this problem by adding the abstractions of class and method over top of low-level functions. This turned out to be a mistake, I think. A much better fix is to just have higher-level functions.",1228081398

381122,comment,380956,381063,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In my experience, the problem's often the opposite.  With most startups, the accountant's job is to tell you when you're being woefully irresponsible with your cash and are about to fail because of it.  That's harsh news to give to a friend.<p>The first company I worked at had an accountant that was a friend of all 3 founders.  She was quite well qualified - Ph.D in accounting, taught at Bentley, had previously worked at several big companies.  But she was not comfortable saying ""No, we don't have the money for this"" when the founders did something stupid, like hiring an expensive engineer sight-unseen from China or delaying the product launch by 6 months while the engineering team pursued a different direction.<p>We ended up going out of business rather abruptly when a $6M bridge loan from the VCs came due and there was no cash to pay it off.  My boss (who was the only member of the management team who wasn't previously friends with the accountant) was incredulous that she could have forgotten that we needed $6M ASAP.  Of course, she hadn't forgotten at all.  She just wasn't comfortable telling management ""Your dreams are about to go up in smoke unless we get more cash quickly and drastically cut expenses.""  Which is completely understandable in a friend, and completely unforgivable in an accountant.",1228081141

381117,comment,380995,380995,0,0,hendler,,,"Great article - because the MVC has a place, but not as the only way to make robust, easy to code and recode, web applications. MVC is not the same thing as a framework either - and because Rails,Cake, or Django chooses an implementation strategy, the ""design pattern"" origins of MVC get lost. Agile gets thrown in there, and it's messy definitions time.
At least MVC being tossed around doesn't offend me as much as the ""Enterprise"" and ""OOP"" Java bureaucrat's rabidness.<p>At least with electrical engineering there are blueprints and ""parts"".  UML does't let me work the way I think (although, when I have enough time, I don't mind it). Can anyone recommend something better than wireframing, IA, and psuedo code for code design? I think that's what's required when you need to pacify those afraid of venturing beyond MVC.",1228081010

Still not all of their ""good"" ideas were validated.<p>Testing ideas, to me, is the best way to change how we think, especially when we're proven wrong. If we know how the experiment will turn out, there's little point in actually running it. And there, I think the process you describe for startups isn't so different than the process for science.

I should have stuck to the initial argument instead of providing commentary.<p>The argument I was examining was ""who are we to decide?"" I think it was answered nicely.<p>To respond:<p>Science is not about ""a good feeling"" about something. It is about mastery. Constructing a model that can be tested. I mean, just think about it -- when I drop a hammer, I can tell you each second how far away it is going to be, its velocity, and its momentum. It's complete mastery to our degree to measure. That's science.<p>I object to scientists becoming social activists, no matter what the cause. Social activism involves fear mongering, public opinion manipulation, politics, and ""messages"" instead of information. Science involves none of this, and if scientists continue to confuse their jobs and their art with others, then science will become cheap and politicized even more than it is today. We'll have ""conservative"" scientists and ""liberal"" scientists and each group will have the usual internet echo chambers to talk into. It's already heading that way.<p>As far as the chicken little, ""why risk it?"" argument, I'd refer you to Occam.

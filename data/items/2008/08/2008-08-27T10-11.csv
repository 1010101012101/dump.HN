Probably a cancel button which takes the user to some previous step would be better.<p>But if this form is part of an enterprise or small-office intranet application, and that's a form you fill out many times a day, perhaps 100s of times, then the form reset button might come in handy.",1219834266

Would anyone here recommend that people use Cobol or Forth to make a web site with, unless the user has some really outlandish requirements?<p>In other words, advice here may be good for getting the 'gist' of how things are or ought to be.  Clearly, when you want to get serious, at that point you should consult a lawyer.  For example, I think pretty much anyone can tell you that forming a partnership instead of an LLC or corporation is likely to be a bad idea, or that people aiming for investments are likely better off with a C corporation.  Of course, there are lots of underlying details that need to be looked after by a professional.<p>Furthermore, I like learning about this stuff, and it's not rocket science.  Complex, in some cases, certainly, but this isn't a group of people that shys away from tough or complex things.  The important thing is to keep in mind that we aren't experts in it, simply learners.",1219833961

People in business pursue the profit-maximizing choice, which at its worst means providing something unique enough that you can charge a monopolistic price. People in government pursue the power-maximizing choice, which at its best means maintaining the status quo until the next election.<p>I guess it's too bad we don't have his whole conversion story, but I notice that NPR will not ask guests how they all became indistinguishable center-leftists.",1219833939

I think that the next revolution in input devices can be a keyboard that is actually like the iphone a display + touchscreen so that the keyboard will drastically change in order to be application-specific.",1219832975

It's not quite clear if he means for people coming in once some of the business groundwork has begun or people coming in as co-founders, but I can't really see it working for either.<p>First employee:  No way you're getting a board seat or that much equity.  Sorry.<p>Co-founder:  If you're going through this many hoops pre-money that seems to be overkill.  If you don't trust the guys that you're co-founding with, you're probably screwed anyway.  I don't mean that trust is everything, things naturally can get ugly, but most of this contract stuff is going to be re-negotiated when you're funded anyway.",1219831358

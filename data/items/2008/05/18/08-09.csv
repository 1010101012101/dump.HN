People just submitted porn, rather than normal content that happened to be NSFW. (Looking at the page now, that still seems to be the case.)",1211100562

193269,comment,193210,193229,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It has felt kind of like the corporate support has waned a bit in recent years...and some of it (like scientific computing, which was momentarily a bright spot for commercial Perl) has gone elsewhere, like Python.  I worked on SciPy and for its corporate sponsors at Enthought for a couple of years, and it was very interesting to note the difference between the two cultures and where development was/is coming from.  A very large percentage of Python development, including development of the language itself, is happening within the corporate world, while Perl is almost entirely volunteer driven.<p>I'm not sure the volunteer nature is entirely positive.  Ruby, with the advent of the extremely commercially oriented Ruby on Rails, saw tremendous growth in a very short time.  It takes a combination of forces to build products that are beautiful inside and out, and even the best Perl projects only ever really get the inner beauty going on.  We've got more/better libraries than any other language, and yet, folks think coding in PHP is easier.  It's a strange phenomenon.<p>I think what I'm trying to say is: The Perl community needs more great web designers.  Oh, wait...We're talking about money and Perl 6.  Right.  So, having real money to get Perl 6 out the door faster is the definition of awesome.<p>Anyway, we're doing our part: We're sponsors of the upcoming YAPC, and plan to crank up our involvement (both monetarily and codewise) in the community by an order of magnitude over the next year.",1211100196
193268,comment,193086,193086,0,0,inovica,,,"Unfortunately this is just all about money. If you read the history of Icahn - especially in the 80's - he was/is a tenacious corporate raider who is more than happy to take a company, split it into component parts and sell it all for a profit. He's only interested in making money from this.  As an investor you can see why he's doing it - he's not interested in the company for running it because of any future potential. He see's value in its share price right now and what he can get for it.  Yahoo is still a great company, that is currently overshadowed by Google. They (the directors) do have a duty to their shareholders though, which is what this is all about.  It will be interesting to see how it goes, but its going to get more complicated I think",1211100001

193252,comment,192654,192654,0,0,mace,,,"I think procrastination and distractions are very much related. When I procrastinate I usually find ways to distract myself with unproductive activities. Unfortunately, unplugging myself from the web is not practical for me.<p>One of the best techniques I've found to reduce procrastination and thus distractions is making lists. Lists work for me because I feel a sense of accomplishment every time I finish something on the list(even if it's the smallest thing.) I've found lists really helpful for decomposing complex tasks too.<p>Another technique I've been using more of lately is to prioritize a very small task to do the next time I sit down to work.  Smaller tasks are less daunting and I tend to do them quickly to get them out of the way. This prevents me from starting my day with any distracting activity (ex. checking email, reading news etc.)",1211097899

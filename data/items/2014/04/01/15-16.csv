There’s TONS of interesting problems, and our customers love us!<p>We’re looking for our first full time engineering hire. As mentioned: if you’re in SF, great, but also let us know if you’re interested in a remote job.<p>* We’re a tiny team, so you’ll need to be at least comfortable with the full stack. It also means you&#x27;ll have a huge amount of influence on how things are done.<p>* Front-end expertise is critical: we have more code in our backbone.js layer than anywhere else, and so you should not only be an expert in javascript, but also know how to manage complex dependencies.<p>* Knowledge of a modern MVC framework. We use grails, but those skills are quite transferable. Java and Hibernate knowledge is a bonus.<p>* AWS and Elasticsearch knowledge would be awesome.<p>We have tons of interesting problems ahead of us, from implementing beautiful realtime dashboards to crunchy machine learning/discrete optimization tasks.<p>Drop me a note at david@interpreterintelligence.com if you’re interested or have any questions.",1396367848

If you knew me you&#x27;d know I&#x27;m not a &quot;build things because we can&quot; type of person. We spent a week tuning PostgreSQL trying to get it fast enough, and couldn&#x27;t (due to the restrictions of ACID we were trying to break). We then hired an outside DB consultancy for a handful of hours, since they claimed they could do it, since consultants for a few hours is cheaper than us writing a DB, and they ultimately came back and said &quot;SQL isn&#x27;t the right choice for this.&quot;<p>I can see how you can make your comment without understanding this context and more. But really, I promise you SQL didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. This is primarily due to the type of data we were putting in there: we needed some aggregates like totals, averages, standard deviation, etc. To get this data, you need to have it inserted first, and we were requesting on the fly in real time at a pretty large rate. This would cause the CPU of the SQL servers to go up pretty hard WHILE also serving hundreds of thousands of insert/update ops/sec. We could&#x27;ve solved this by adding read slaves and all that, but now we&#x27;re talking expensive CapEx for something we were confident we could fix with some C in a week or two.<p>Enter: the two servers linked in my parent comment.<p>We sacrificed durability, accuracy, and some level of safety (if the server crashes before an accumulation period once every X seconds, you lose that data) for raw speed. We calculated out the acceptable tolerances (max % off the real value) and tuned our data structures to that (bloomd and hlld both expose these tunables). We then ran both servers in parallel to our existing SQL solution for a few weeks to verify the numbers were correct. Finally, we switched over.<p>Like I said, when we built that we were doing maybe 450,000 metrics per second. That was 2 years ago. Now they&#x27;re doing much much more than that, and both hlld and bloomd are running on a single m3.medium with no persistence (they aggregate then issue a single large UPDATE to SQL) with no issue.<p>The amortized operating expenses (human labor) cost of developing the servers, along with the thousands saved in server costs, and with the effectively zero ops overhead (they never go down, they&#x27;re stateless, etc.) has been well worth it.<p>Hope that makes our decision a little clearer.",1396367306

Here, a chance to grapple with large-scale payments; there, a purpose-built &quot;big data&quot; storage system; elsewhere, software running on an exotic platform; look hard enough and you may even find custom hardware to tinker with.<p>Consider a greater challenge: the one lurking in the shadows beneath all the other challenges; a maddening, beautiful challenge that awaits all applications, be they YC startups or giant tech companies, the hunt for which leads through the crevices of the payment processing gateways, the arcane backend of the storage system, and the insane, non-euclidian instruction patterns output by embedded compilers. The discovery of the unknown horrible secrets of our universe, the bending of those secrets to your will, and the billing of clients for PDF documentation of those secrets along with their exploitation steps and mitigation advice.<p>Matasano and iSEC together comprise one of the largest pure software security firms in the world. Our clients are the best companies --- and <i>most</i> of the largest of them.

I ran the following two benchmark simultaneously against my Macbook Air 11&quot; that are able to trigger the worst case scenario from the point of view of the HLL data structure:<p><pre><code>    ./redis-benchmark -P 64 -r 100000000 -n 100000000 \\\n      pfadd hll __rand_int__\n    pfadd hll __rand_int__: 320125.56\n</code></pre>\nAnd<p><pre><code>    ./redis-benchmark -P 64 -r 100000000 -n 100000000 \\\n      pfcount hll\n    pfcount hll: 313309.62\n</code></pre>\nSince we are adding random integers in the range from 0 to 100 million we are basically triggering the worst case in which the updates are as frequent as possible in the registers.<p>At the same time HLLCOUNT is running in the other benchmark forcing the update of the cached cardinality as often as possible.<p>Yet we get around 640k ops/sec in a single core, that multiplied for the 4 cores of an Air i7 gets you to 2.4m ops/sec.<p>EDIT 1: Note that while I&#x27;m using random data as argument of PFADD, we are not using N HLLs but a single one, so tis benchmark is surely biased as cache misses are rare. But using multiple keys will not be terrible like losing an order of magnitude, just a reasonable percentage of OPS will go away.<p>EDIT 2: I had a process running in background consuming a lot of CPU, actually I tried again and reached 900k OPS/sec for core, but read EDIT 1 for more info.",1396366883

I turn 19 in two months.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming for leisure for years. I got my first job programming in 10th grade, and loved it. When I graduated a year later, I went to a semester of college.<p>It&#x27;s not that college was easy-- it was difficult for me. I just didn&#x27;t care as much for the subjects I was being tought, and didn&#x27;t try to succeed. It was time for me to pay for the second semester. I managed to pay for the first one with liquid, but that wasn&#x27;t going to happen again.<p>My parents strongly discouraged not going to college, although they are biased in that matter; my mother has dual masters degrees, and my father has a Ph.D, and their degrees are very important to their career pathes.<p>The job I was at wasn&#x27;t enough to sustain myself. I was underpaid, the commute was long, and upper management didn&#x27;t agree on the value that I was adding to the company, despite direct management having a conflicting opinion. Anecdote: one of my friends that worked at a nearby grocery store who&#x27;s job consisted of literally putting fruit on shelves was making more than me, which made me a bit bitter.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find anything locally, since I lived in a remote, rural US town, so I started applying to various surrounding cities. The first job I applied to, I got an offer, and I took it. It was fun, a great learning experience, and I even got a promotion to mid-level developer. I&#x27;ve since left for a job at a similar position at a startup, mostly for fun. It has turned out to be much harder than I expected, but that&#x27;s OK- challenges are fun.<p>I have felt incredibly valued by my coworkers and management. I feel successful, and I have no reason to regret my career choices.<p>My advice to you is to keep pushing forward. I feel like there isn&#x27;t a HN consensus on this topic, but it is my opinion that there are few programming jobs that require a college education and do not provide an &quot;or similar experience&quot; clause, particularly within US-based startups. The majority of my employers haven&#x27;t cared for a degree; they just want their employees to be good.[1]<p>Also, check out online freelancing sites such as oDesk and Elance. It&#x27;s easy to get started, and I only saw one or two listings that required a degree in the three months I spent on oDesk. One of my contracts turned into the full time position that I have now.<p>[1] I may be susceptible to survivorship bias, as any employer that would agree to hire someone without a degree obviously wouldn&#x27;t care for the degree.",1396366690

You need only semi-reliability, ie. knowing when a packet was lost. The way to handle a lost packet is application specific, but most likely you&#x27;d like to send the most up-to-date data instead of retransmitting the state from 100ms or one second ago.<p>Flow control needs to make sure that no more packets are sent than can be received but the goal is to minimize latency, not maximize throughput.<p>The whole idea of &quot;implementing TCP over UDP&quot; is just silly - why would you want to do that?

There may already be something on the market, but what about developing it into a physical device running on dedicated hardware? Crowd-fund an &quot;alerter badge&quot; or pin or whatever, and budget heavily for testing & verification. You could be onto a winner.<p>EDIT: Please don&#x27;t be put off altogether by the comments.

Which is why I think...<p>...There needs to some kind of legislation/regulation on lawsuits.  Perhaps, the plaintiff must pay the legal fees for the defendant upfront, up to a maximum of 5% of the desired damages being sought.<p>Example: If you want to sue for a $1 million, you have to pay up to $50K in legal fees for the defendant.  If you win the case, the defendant&#x27;s legal fees are tacked onto the damages that he must pay. If you lose the case, you lose all your money.<p>I think this would discourage many lawsuits from happening. Only those with true merit would be pursued.",1396365512

Early in the project, most of the connections for testing will happen over a loopback interface and LAN anyway.<p>However, if you&#x27;re doing a real time multiplayer game, you can&#x27;t ship with TCP or your reputation (and sales, etc) will be ruined. No-one likes laggy gameplay.<p>In the above, I use the term &quot;real time&quot; as in a &quot;soft real time software system&quot;, not real time as opposed to a turn based game. In other words, &quot;real time&quot; in the sense that if significant latency occurs, the game will produce incorrect results.<p>Arguably, most games do not fall under this category. E.g. a real time strategy game server has the option to &quot;stop the world&quot; and wait for all players to get back in sync. They are essentially very fast turn based games when it comes to analyzing it as a software system.<p>This means that most games can probably use TCP.<p>If you can&#x27;t survive one second of latency, you must use UDP. You can bootstrap your project on TCP, but you can&#x27;t use it over real networks.<p>> When everything is working perfectly and there is no packet loss (assuming Nagle is disabled), UDP and TCP will perform approximately equivalently; data gets through immediately, it&#x27;s delivered to the application, there&#x27;s no need to retransmit.<p>This is important, both ways. When everything works correctly, either one will do. But in real world, everything doesn&#x27;t work always smoothly. You won&#x27;t know if your network code works well before you&#x27;ve tried it with several players across the world. On the other side of town is not far enough.<p>> And on most modern consumer networks, packet loss is very low.<p>This is true only if you measure using &quot;ping&quot; in a network with no contention. That is not a real world measurement.<p>In most consumer networks, the WAN throughput is smaller than LAN, so if you have several computers hooked up, the router will have to drop some packets if everyone attempts to send or receive at their maximum capacity.<p>Go play Counter Strike and have your little brother turn on a BitTorrent service or your wife watching movies on NetFlix. Packet loss <i>will</i> occur.<p>> You may never even see the conditions where UDP should be faster.<p>It is <i>not</i> about being faster. The throughput of TCP should be pretty much equal to UDP when you average over time. The pings should be similar most of the time.<p>It&#x27;s all about latency. A single lost packet on TCP will inhibit all the packets sent after it until the situation is lost. This can be one second or more, regardless of the quality of the connection in ideal conditions.<p>The bottom line is: <i>know</i> whether you will need UDP or not. Do not guess, measure and test it in real world networks. But you can still use TCP to bootstrap your project.<p>Regardless whether you use TCP or UDP your network game <i>must</i> have a mechanism for dealing with latency, like stopping the world in an RTS game (over TCP) or predicting the movements of characters in an FPS game (over UDP). TCP does not magically solve all the problems in networking, it also creates some.",1396365007

I want to contribute this excerpt from one of the original papers on the topic:<p>&quot;In this paper we present a set of postulates for the  foundation of formal logic, in which we avoid use of the free, or real, variable... Our reason for avoiding use of the free variable is that we require that every combination of symbols belonging to our system, if it represents \na proposition at all, shall represent a particular proposition, unambiguously, and without the addition of verbal explanations.&quot;<p>The motivation was a setting for doing &quot;precise and unambiguous&quot; mathematics. Mathematical results are used pervasively today, so the overall vision is obviously important.<p>Whereas The Calculus was developed in response to the difficulty of calculating physical quantities, such as those about celestial bodies, the lambda calculus had a more foundational motivation.<p>None-the-less, lambda calculus is tremendously useful for solving &quot;real world&quot; problems. Most of these problems arise where doing &quot;precise mathematics&quot; is important but tedious, difficult and/or time-consuming; or the related task of defining computations correctly.",1396364462

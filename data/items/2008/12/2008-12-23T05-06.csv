Shine a 1.5 watt laser across the room at a receiver to charge your cell phone?  Really?  What's the advantage?  Is the market for this thing solely folks who like to keep their cell phone sitting on the side of the room that doesn't have any outlets?  ;-)<p>The competitors like Powercast and Powermat sound a lot more interesting.  Can someone please provide me with the imagination that I'm clearly missing?",1230011889

Public firms report all of their expenses so it shouldn't be hard to see how their money is spent - just look at their income statements and statement of cash flows.<p>I think the real reason why banks aren't reporting how the TARP money is spent is because they don't know.<p>Cash comes in, cash goes out.  But it's hard to match specific cash outflows (besides variable costs - and even those can be tough) to specific cash inflows.",1230011264

  * Going into debt to buy domestic goods is bad.
  * Not going into debt to buy foreign goods is fine.
  * Not going into debt to buy domestic goods is fine. Hence
  * The ""trade deficit"" is entirely beside the point.  Moreover,
  * Consumer spending is not the cause of prosperity.
  * The collapse in consumer demand reflects people realizing they were spending beyond their means.
  * Having the government ""stimulate"" the economy with demand only postpones the inevitable, because
  * There are too many companies making too many consumer goods, and
  * This has to change.

407305,comment,406451,407290,0,0,raganwald,,,"Most of the problem is the `return` keyword. In a proc or lambda, it returns from the proc or lambda. In a block, it returns from whatever is enclosing the block, like a proc, lambda, or method.<p>If you had a block that was an actual object, it could outlive its enclosing environment. Calling return within it would reincarnate its enclosing environment. Calling return twice would fork time.<p>In other words, if a block was an object, the return keyword would create a <i>continuation</i>. This is a very expensive, very heavyweight feature in Ruby, and the whole point of blocks is to provide something cheap and lightweight.<p>Note that a proc or lambda has no such problem, since a return within it returns to whatever invokes the #call method of the proc or lambda.<p>Imagine how much simpler things would be if Matz had worked this all out and decided that the return keyword was more trouble than it was worth?",1230009607

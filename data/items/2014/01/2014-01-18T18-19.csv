The Brian Krebs article stated that the hacker compromised an externally facing web server and used that as a bridge to get into the corporate (private) network.<p>Since the POS terminals were all running a variant of Windows, it might have been as simple as querying the Active Directory to find out where everything was located within the Target network (at least for the Windows machines).  Comments in the Krebs article also speculated that they exploited an account with a BMC systems management tool used at Target as well.",1390071592

It allows strings to be generic over allocators without suffering the performance penalty of a virtual call on every malloc and free. Go&#x27;s solution would be to just take the penalty of a virtual call (as interfaces require virtual calls everywhere) and try to make it up with devirtualization optimizations and/or inlining.<p>> After all, nobody comes into every Lisp thread demanding that Lisp grow a type-checker.<p>That&#x27;s because making a workable type system for Lisp is a <i>very</i> hard problem.

7081803,comment,7081445,7081445,2,0,mannykannot,,,"This article illustrates one of the many ways by which software becomes unjustifiably complex.<p>Firstly, there is nothing about the problem that calls for object-orientation. As the author realizes, the classes in the class-based implementation are non-contributing baggage.<p>All the problem description actually calls for is three functions and a conditional clause. The implementation using functions presented here, however, is considerably more complicated than that, possibly because the author chose (deliberately or not) to attempt to mirror the form of the class-using solution.<p>This code was written for illustrative purposes, but the same sort of thing happens in real-world programming when people make a-priori decisions about the style of a solution, rather than be guided by the requirement. Having an preference for &#x27;sophisticated&#x27; styles exacerbates the problem.<p>A common justification for this sort of complexity is that it makes the code more reusable, and in some cases it is justified. Whenever using that justification, however, one should consider how much simplification is actually achieved, and whether its reuse is likely, and weigh that against the immediate costs of the extra complexity.<p>Another justification is that it promotes correct use, and again this is sometimes justified. Note, however, that neither of solutions enforce one of the few usage rules of the example: that the normalization function should be applied before the calculation. Anyone creating his own concrete derivation from AbstractCalc has to remember to call the normalization function, and gets no warning if he fails to do so.",1390071419

What most people mean when they say police state is when there is political intent to create a police state, a good example of this being the Stasi. However this political intention is not required to end up in a very similar situation. The thing is, the only thing that is required for a police state to form is that enough resources be available to the police and a framework that allows them to use those resources with impunity.

You could learn the language and frameworks that Facebook used, and the stack, and the systems management, and all the places where scale negatively impacted the user experience and how they fixed that. (unlike Google they are very open with this stuff so its easier to do from the outside). <i>That</i> is a goal and then the languages and frameworks fall out of the goal.

Did it miss?

For example, while foo.example.com and bar.example.com are both owned by example.com, foo.co.uk and bar.co.uk are two different domains, since co.uk is part of the UK domain hierarchy (along with ac.uk and so on) and registrations happen at the third level. Therefore it would be undesirable if foo.co.uk could set cookies for the entire .co.uk, as in the UK ccTLD world that&#x27;s equivalent to setting a cookie for all of .com.<p>So there&#x27;s a big list (initiated by Mozilla) specifying that .com is a public suffix, .co.uk is a public suffix, etc., and wildcard cookies on public suffixes are refused. This has been adapted, as a huge hack, to big sites that have user-registerable subdomains. So now .blogspot.com is also treated as a public suffix, since anyone can &quot;register&quot; a foo.blogspot.com under it.<p>However new entries are added on a fairly ad-hoc basis, so a site that allows user subdomains that can run JS is vulnerable by default unless they explicitly get themselves added.

7081699,comment,7078822,7081344,4,0,deong,,,"I switched to the TEK about three months ago after maybe six or seven years with the Kinesis (although without the foot pedals). Here&#x27;s what I would say so far.<p>1. The TEK feels better in terms of physical key presses. Both use the same Cherry MX Brown switches, but because the Kinesis is a big hollow piece of flimsy plastic and the TEK a very solid brick, the overall effect is noticeably nicer to my fingers at least.<p>2. The function keys are much better on the TEK.<p>3. The arrow keys and brackets are better positioned by <i>miles</i> on the TEK. You can remap the keys of course, but the Kinesis only has one column to the right of the &#x27;P&#x27; key, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find a good place to put them, and I just left them where they are. Similarly, the tilde/backquote key is also on that horrible bottom row on the Kinesis. And those arrow keys...putting left and right on the left hand and up and down on the right hand is one of those things that probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but after maybe seven years using the keyboard, those arrows were every single bit as completely unusable as they were the first day I sat down with it.<p>4. In contrast, the thumb well ends up being a better place for things like the enter and backspace keys than a single column in the middle, so score one for the Kinesis there.<p>5. The 209 International TEK has plenty of modifier keys. You get control on each hand, meta on each hand, and a blank key on each hand you can choose how to map. Plus you get a menu key in the middle column, and the space bar is split, so you can remap whichever side you don&#x27;t use for space for something else. On the Kinesis, the thumb wells only have two modifier keys per side, so if you want symmetric layouts, you&#x27;re stuck without a command or control key on the Mac, or super/hyper/windows on Windows or Linux. You can remap Caps Lock for that purpose of course, but there&#x27;s no place on the right hand to put an equivalent key. If you use Emacs on a Mac, you know how badly you need Control, Command, and Option keys, and not having that ability on my Kinesis was one of the biggest reasons I wanted to try the TEK.<p>6. Remapping keys on the TEK is ridiculously difficult. You have to do the remapping on their web site in a (fairly nice, actually) little Javascript GUI. That part works well enough, but then to apply the changes, you have to download and flash new a new firmware image, which can only be done in Windows. Not in a virtual machine, but with the keyboard plugged into the back of a real USB port on a real Windows computer. I don&#x27;t own a Windows machine, so any time I want to try out a new remapping, I have to haul my keyboard to work and reboot my Linux box there into Windows. On the Kinesis, you remap on the fly by pressing keys right on the keyboard.<p>7. I&#x27;ve bought two of both models now, and both are sort of a mixed bag. I can&#x27;t stress enough how cheaply the Kinesis is made. Every once in a while, I have to take apart the flimsy plastic case and glue the USB hub back down (and yes, it&#x27;s just glued right to the plastic shell). The TEK is built like a brick, but one of the two has taken a full month of use so far, and it&#x27;s still not completely &quot;broken in&quot;. That&#x27;s the term that Truly Ergonomic use to refer to the property of your keyboard registering the keys you press. Out of the box, about 15-20 keys either didn&#x27;t work at all, or else pressing them once would insert anywhere from zero to five or six of whatever letter you pressed. They tell you that you might need to press each key a few hundred times to &quot;break them in&quot;. In my case, maybe 25,000 times is more like it. If I didn&#x27;t live in Iceland, I would have demanded a replacement, but since shipping is such an enormous hassle, I decided to see if it got better, and it mostly has. My first TEK worked perfectly, but this second one still has maybe a 2-3% error rate, either duplicating or ignoring keypresses. Which is way better than the 57% error rate I measured on the &#x27;B&#x27; key during the first few days I had it (and several others were nearly as bad).<p>8. The Kinesis has a USB hub. It snaps away from the case and dangles loose inside the hollow shell occasionally, but you can take the thing apart with a handful of screws and glue it back down at least. The TEK doesn&#x27;t have USB ports. Not a huge deal I know, but it means that I need a separate USB hub with the TEK, and with the Kinesis, I could do without one.<p>Summing everything together, #4 is a really big point in favor of the Kinesis. You can get used to either one, but you really have to reach to hit that middle column on the TEK, whereas the Kinesis puts all those keys right under your thumbs. The remapping solution for the TEK is frankly embarrassing, but once you settle on a layout, it&#x27;s not something you need to do very often. In contrast, the TEK feels better and on the whole, has a layout that is better designed for programmers I think, with the brackets and some other non-special keys in more standard locations. And for me, the modifier key situation is at least as big of an advantage for the TEK as the thumb well is for the Kinesis.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t say for sure yet which I prefer. I&#x27;m sticking with the TEK for now, and I <i>think</i>, if push comes to shove, that the modifier keys are going to be the clincher, but both are really good keyboards.",1390069824

I do not think that it was;  I think there is an (quite innocent) dishonesty to the claim, and I feel like calling this out.<p>The language used contains typical signals of the sort of para-academic elitism parodied in &#x27;Fraiser&#x27;, starting with the use of the uncommon word &#x27;jest&#x27; in the first full sentence and continuing with the adoption of &quot;we&quot; and the scattering of various tofferies throughout remainder of the text.<p>I was quite annoyed by this until I looked at the author&#x27;s bio page, whereupon I thought, okay, perhaps for him this feels like his natural voice.  Making the grade is one of his things, and he has in fact made the grade repeatedly and excessively, and he is young enough that there hasn‚Äôt really been much time for him to reflect on this much.<p>He&#x27;s enthusiastic about teaching, which is a rare gem of a quality amongst the professoriate.  So do not be crabby, you old substandard goat, who can barely add two to two without the crutch of an operator.<p>Okay.<p>However, the author&#x27;s audience is much narrower -- he is making it much narrower -- than he may realize.  He is writing for a person like himself, and he is, in a somewhat standard manner, offering the subject by way of little tests of the intellect, couched in suggestions of superiority.<p>This is wonderful fare for a student who&#x27;s sense of self-worth is founded on the suggestion that they are more clever than the others;  it is neither food nor balm for the rest of the anyones who might have cause or need to seek a more general understanding of tensors.<p>What I take exception to is that presenting the subject in this style <i>while claiming to speak to the rest of the anyones</i> will tend to <i>reaffirm</i> &#x27;tensorphobia&#x27; for such people, essentially gaslighting them;  this is not helpful.  It is a distinct harm.<p>I remember realizing, in my first year of university, that a person of ‚Äògeneral‚Äô (low) intelligence would in fact be entirely capable of understanding the proof of the derivative, <i>if it was taught to them properly</i>.  Everyone routinely understands more complicated things.  The true barrier would be their indifference;  they would have no use for such understanding.  But otherwise the failure would not be on the part of the student;  it would be on the part of the teacher.<p>I am not suggesting the same of tensors;  perhaps I myself lack some quality that is needed to understand them.  But I recognize the language that is being used here, and it has an easily comprehensible and distinct meaning that has nothing to do with tensors.<p>I think the author is doing wonderful and useful work, but I think he should reflect long and hard on his rhetorical affectations.",1390069068

That‚Äôs the standard definition and the result is quite intuitive, even for a layman (infinity = verrry biiig).<p>For other applications, it‚Äôs sensible to define 1+2+3+4+...=-1/12(R) with an (R) to denote that you are not using the standard definition, but the Ramanujan definition. (You can drop the (R) one you are sure all the public has enough technical background.) The problem is that the Ramanujan definition doesn‚Äôt have many of the intituive properties of the standard definition. For example, in this article, eq. (8) and eq.(9) say that 0+2+3+4+... != 2+3+4+5+...<p>This is not similar to not discussing Lagrangian mechanics in a secondary school book. It‚Äôs more similar to mix Newtonian mechanics with the properties of the Higgs boson, and mix the density of water and the fact that electron really don‚Äôt have mass, and even say that the R and L electrons are different particle in spite the gravity force cancels the centrifugal force of the Moon (in a no Newtonian reference frame). It‚Äôs confusing, and mixing the theories can produce a paradox and be unintelligible.<p>If you mix them correctly and use just a little of the properties of theory inside the other, you can produce a convincing almost intelligible explanation that produce a paradox. The important point is to hide the technical problems in seemingly obvious properties, like in magic. The standard examples are mixing results of special relativity and Newtonian mechanics, or Quantum mechanics and Newtonian mechanics.<p>For the layman, I prefer an explanation that start saying that 1+2+3+4+...=infinity, then explain that there are other definitions, then a Ramanujan photograph, then some magic and handwaving to show 1+2+3+4+...= -1/12 (R), then enumerate some applications of this new definition, then show that 1+2+3+4+... != 0+1+2+3+4+... , so you must be very careful with this new summation.<p>It‚Äôs impossible to explain all the technical details to a layman, but it‚Äôs important to explain that they are hidden there, and why sometime there is necessary to make definitions that are not intuitive.",1390068524

Not that it surprises me: My mum isn&#x27;t from here, though she&#x27;s now a naturalized citizen, and she has a far greater understanding of US politics than the natives!<p>But then, I also think there&#x27;s a certain amount of similarity among politicians the world over, or as you stated &quot;the real class in power.&quot;<p>To illustrate one particular sore point that meshes well with your description, many bills drafted by the US Congress are seldom these days drafted by politicians and are instead written by their staffers or, through lobbyists, by other entities that have a keen interest on influencing the bill&#x27;s content. When former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated regarding the ACA that &quot;We have to pass it before we can know what&#x27;s in it,&quot; she wasn&#x27;t joking. Many of us laughed, more still called her stupid, but she--perhaps unwittingly--provided an insight into Congress few of us are fortunate enough to experience. After all, of those who do read the bills or are instrumental in their construction, they effectively have free reign to inject what they wish. With partisan politics being such as it is, mobilizing your compatriots to vote on a bill isn&#x27;t especially difficult.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, because when you have laws fabricated by organizations with deep pockets who, by virtue of their expenditure can effectively select those who win elections, any attempt to effect change will be toothless.<p>Anyway, I deeply appreciate this conversation and would like to thank you for the exchange we&#x27;ve had.

I moved out here about a year ago and was looking for something with a balance of affordability, comfort, and location (near Stanford).  Most of Palo Alto was out of the question because of price, and I never really felt comfortable (safe) in East Palo Alto or the parts of Palo Alto near 101.  Going north, Menlo Park and Atherton are even more expensive.  Redwood City can be somewhat cheaper but neither the area nor the apartments were in great shape.<p>So, that leaves Mountain View and Sunnyvale.  Both cities are very safe and quiet (maybe <i>too</i> quiet for some).  There are a lot of apartments in these two cities which aren't ridiculously expensive. However, most of the apartment complexes are relatively small, so your best bet is to come down here and drive around and see which complexes meet your needs.<p>I personally moved to Mountain View near Rengstorff Ave. and California St., an area we call ""apartment city"" because the housing is so dense.  It's quiet and residential and there's a lot of shopping within walking distance.  I definitely recommend this area, but you should still come down and check it out before signing a lease.<p>As an aside, I've got some experience with startups in education.  I worked for a couple successful startups in higher education, and almost founded a K-12 company in the spring.  Drop me an email if you'd like to share war stories -- now, or after you move.",1189658948

54126,comment,53987,54053,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The idea that Global Warming may not be human caused is a radical idea these days, completely non politically correct and disruptive - hence a good candidate for YC news.  I don't know anything about the source of this release, but I have read now at least 10+ scientific articles with evidence on the likeliest cause of warming being the Sun, especially given the fact that all the planets in the Solar system are also warming up at the same time (as reported by NASA), and the fact that this pattern has occurred in the past countless times.",1189656255

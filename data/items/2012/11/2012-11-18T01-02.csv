He says he wants to ""succeed"" -- he didn't say he wants to get ""really big"" anywhere.<p>In your ""startup = growth"" essay you laid it out very clearly.  From the investor perspective, the only thing that influences success (returns) in any way is when a company gets ""really big"".  Everything else is noise.<p>But he's just giving a founder perspective.  It's not contradictory, and to me it makes sense.  I would definitely call what he described in the post ""success"", i.e. using the proceeds from a previous company to start a profitable new one.<p>You might argue from the data that he could have grown faster with a co-founder.  That could be true in aggregate, but there might be some other factor which makes it untrue for certain situations.  As he points out, there are also risks involved, i.e. fights between co-founders which I think you pointed out as a huge source of failure.<p>Also, you only really have data from YC companies, which lately are biased towards having multiple founders.<p>edit: I guess the undertone is that people perceive that you've redefined the rules of the game (certainly ""startup = growth"" does that) and are trying to restore some balance in the dialogue.  I think they perceive a misalignment of interests in terms of pushing for extremely high growth whereas you would argue there is none.",1353202896

I appreciate the support for single founders, but this isn't a supporting argument.<p>> If books can be written by one person and become successful. Why cant startups?<p>Because books and startups have nothing in common? Lots of successful endeavors are done by a single person, but that doesn't put the efforts of a single person vs. a team on the same footing, /especially/ as the problems increase in difficulty. Here's a better example:<p>""If children can be raised by one person and become successful, why can't startups?""<p>Sure. There are many children who have been raised by single parents and have become very successful. But that doesn't mean /statistically/, this is as easy as having both parents.[0]<p>The point that is being made counter to this is very simple: Yes, starting a startup can be done by one person. As can a lot of things. But statistically speaking, there are more successful startups that have multiple founders than single founders. You already provided the pie charts in support of this argument! Now to be fair, correlation does not prove causation, but the point is generally: Starting a startup is hard. Understanding the needs of your customers and both developing a solution to meet these need and reserving time to convince them that you've met their needs (selling) is very, very hard.<p>One of Ryan Carson's arguments (#2) was in essence that having no co-founders means you can top-down dictate leadership. I don't know about you, but I'm not always right. I've never actually met anybody who's always right. Having a team who's on equal footing with you allows you to vet concepts before they catastrophically destroy your company.<p>To paraphrase Chris Rock: Yes, you can do it without a [co-founder], but that doesn't mean it's to be done.<p>A good co-founder will almost always make your business more successful. And that's all there is to it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/upload/parentalconflict.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/upload/parentalcon...</a>",1353202473

I think going solo is multiple times as hard, but sometimes that increased burn motivates people in strange ways.  It also is a hell of a lot cheaper if the person is experienced to only have one, this can increase the runway much farther.  One of the problems I see with YC and Techstars both is that well experienced people with mortgages and kids are at a huge disadvantage due to their inability to take as little as a group of kids right out of college.  Perhaps well experienced solo founders are a different animal, it would be an interesting experiment to try and get a larger data set to see exactly which way it would go.",1353202088

Underneath all the high ideals people like to spout off about Twitter it all just comes off as sour grapes and armchair quarterbacking. Everyone knows how to solve Twitter's problem unless you work for Twitter seems to be the message but we've heard all those ideas enough times and I'm quite sure Twitter is aware of alternative ways to run the company. So are we really going to think so highly of ourselves as to think we have the solution and the people running Twitter are just morons? Large companies do some idiotic things but I think we need to give them a little more credit than that.<p>Now, am I saying we shouldn't blame Twitter? Of course not! The people, particularly and especially developers, have every right to be upset and the criticism of them locking down their API, changing the rules, bending the rules unfairly,  and just generally acting in bad faith are justified. That said, in the end your point still stands. Twitter is a business and this is how it has chosen to become profitable. We have two choices now. Either deal with it or not use/develop for it.<p>In my own personal opinion, I think that despite the anti-Twitter sentiment within the developer and tech community Twitter will still thrive precisely because of what they're doing now whether it's right or not. Obviously Twitter has decided that the prospect of losing the developer community is worth the risk. Hey, that's business.",1353200954

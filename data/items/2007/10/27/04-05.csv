There is a position inbetween having alot of promiscuous sex and having no sex.  I am merely stating why I think alot of promiscuous sex can be a problem.  People are, of course, free to do whatever they want and don't have to listen to me.<p>Anyways, I'm not trying to be a troll.  People keep misunderstanding or needing elaboration, so I explain and elaborate.  If people ignored what I said I wouldn't see a need to keep posting.",1193460838

At the near future I believe WebKit, Prism and other ""embeddable browsers"" will be at any kind of place running our web applications.",1193459387

I remember this clearly because I had exactly the same idea. I suspect that's one of the goals with Jottit as well.",1193459296

73075,comment,71461,72998,0,0,yters,,,"I didn't mean to imply zealous abstinence, just am against the prurient nymphomania or whatever recommended in that reddit thread.  <p>Still, though, I think there is something to be said for virginity.  For some reason it was even an ideal in the Greek world before Christianity, e.g. Plato.  But it wasn't an ideal in the sense that sex was considered bad, just virginity, voluntarily taken, was a nobler thing.  That's another discussion, though.<p>First of all, I'm pretty sure it's commonly accepted that the notion of the 'dark ages' is a product of bad scholarship, though I don't have a good cite for you, so you can ignore that point.  As for religion and science, I'm against any attempt to undermine reason, but this means we have to be open to the truth no matter where it lies, whether in today's 'science' (which is very philosophically narrow) or theology.  However, this doesn't mean contradiction between the two is resolved by ignoring science.  If people really believe theology is supported by the evidence, then they cannot believe there are any real contradictions between science and theology.  That's the position of the sophisticated element of the ID movement.  Also, keep in mind that the ID movement is not essentially Christian or fundamentalist.  For example, Christopher Langan is an ID theorist who is a pantheist, which is pretty interesting.",1193457977

8329718,comment,8327307,8327307,2,0,Thriptic,,,"I worked at RadioShack one summer about 5 years ago during college, and it is frankly not surprising to me that the business is failing.<p>RadioShack was never able to offer competitive pricing on anything besides cell phones while I worked there, and would frequently employ somewhat dubious business tactics when it came to pricing (permanent &quot;sales&quot; on many things like batteries, &quot;sales&quot; where the sale price was the same as the normal retail price which was only disclosed in small type on the bottom of the pricing label).<p>RadioShack had an employee compensation system which STRONGLY incentivized cell phone sales resulting in the infamous aggressive phone pushing. At RadioShack you were (and maybe still are?) paid minimum wage plus you received a percentage of the gross store revenue each day if it exceeded the daily sales target (a few thousand iirc), a fixed amount for each extended warranty sold ($1-2 iirc), and an amount for each phone sold (something like $20-50). At our store we never had the customer volume to hit our sales targets, and so the only way we could make money was to sell phones.<p>The employee turnover at my store was insanely high, and none of the employees knew anything about electronics (including myself at the time), computers, or AV equipment. This was generally OK though, as most of our customers were also not tech savvy and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. Customers overwhelmingly came in to buy AV cabling, batteries, digital TV antennas, and analog to digital set top boxes. We never sold a TV or any other high value item while I was there.<p>Perhaps RadioShack will be able to pivot, but if not, I don&#x27;t think the world will be that worse off.<p>As an aside, I felt bad pushing phones and worse charging ignorant people $30 for an HDMI cable that could be had from eforcity for under a dollar, and would therefore frequently steer customers away towards Amazon for such items. This practice somewhat perversely earned me regular customers, and by the end of the summer I was running what amounted to an off the books IT support desk out of the store where people would bring in their laptops and phones and I would troubleshoot their problems for 50-100 bucks. Thanks for providing me with retail space for my small business RadioShack!",1410958797

For instance, if you click a blue Elvis poster, we don&#x27;t know if it because you like blue or Elvis, hence we end up showing some items that may be far from what you are looking for.<p>That being said, there is without doubt room for improvement and we got a lot of data to help with that today. In the Bayesian lingo, this is all about fine-tuning the priors.<p>One of this things we are excited about is the use case where the user knows what they want, but don&#x27;t know the word for it. For instance it may turn out that I may like Expressionism (this is in fact true) but I don&#x27;t know the word for that.<p>If you know that you want an Elvis poster, there isn&#x27;t much point in using Findmelike right now. I think it would be <i>very</i> cool to have both a text search box where you could enter what you know, and then get the Findmelike visual choice search on the matching items to narrow those down aesthetically.",1410958546

It&#x27;s really cool. I say &#x27;do their best&#x27; because different games sometimes define regions along different borders, stuff like that.

Even though PBA was the stuff with the highest profit margin, I still had to go to those cell phone meetings because I only sold about one phone a month, on average. Nobody else in my store would go near the parts section, so that was essentially my job. And we had enough business in that area that it was my /full time/ job. So I had two choices: help those customers, or don&#x27;t because I&#x27;m too busy trying to sell cell phones. As anyone who&#x27;s ever bought or sold a cellphone knows, it&#x27;s a long process to get everything set up and see the customer out. When a cellphone transaction is happening, everything else stops, so customers looking for help finding a fuse or battery are SOL and end up leaving.<p>In my (anecdotal) experience working at 2 different Radio Shacks in different parts of the country with vastly different demographics, RS didn&#x27;t need cellphones (or laptops, or TVs). I would claim that the cellphone business drove away more customers than it brought in. If RS was a simple, no-hassle PBA retailer, I am convinced that it wouldn&#x27;t be in the shape it is in now.",1410957554

I even went as far as writing a macro that could use defadvice to generically preserve the selection for any other command on the second day of using emacs.<p>A bigger hurdle was learning the Lisp jargon, so that I could find the correct function to call when searching for it, whether in emacs itself, or online. But once I knew about the point, that the selection is called the region and is the text between mark and point, that files are called buffers, that open is called find, etc., it was pretty smooth sailing.<p>It&#x27;s fairly trivial to find the source for an arbitrary elisp function - just C-h f <function-name>, and follow the source link. Plugins like helm (dynamically filtered list searches) make it very easy to find relevant functions too.<p>Elisp has a couple of features that make it work well as an application extension language: dynamic variable scope and function advice are two that are fairly unique to Lisp (technically, Javascript has dynamic scope via the eval function, but it&#x27;s not usually a good idea to use it). These things make it easy to tweak behaviour from the outside.<p>However, contra other people&#x27;s opinions, Elisp is not fast. It is slow, very very slow, compared to efficient languages. My startup time is just about tolerable on a modern machine, but not tolerable enough to stop me starting emacs --daemon every time I reboot. Scrolling through large files with line numbers enabled is slow, and the UI has a few milliseconds of lag for almost every non-trivial action. Dynamic searches need very noticeable debounce delays for list refreshes or otherwise things get unresponsive.",1410956666

But it didn&#x27;t progress any further because Stallman vetoed basing Emacs on Common Lisp (he considers CL to be too big a language, and to some extent just doesn&#x27;t like it). In retrospect I&#x27;m not sure this was a good call: Guile as a general VM with custom infrastructure to support both Scheme and Elisp is not really a more clean, minimalistic infrastructure anyway. The semantics of Elisp/Scheme are too different to be able to just stick in a Scheme implementation with a smallish compatibility layer, like you could with Elisp hosted on CL.",1410956238

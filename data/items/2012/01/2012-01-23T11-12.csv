3500046,comment,3499792,3499905,7,0,thedaveoflife,,,"The lesson from the article isn't that every country should be a net exporter like Germany... it's that Germany has found success by focusing on producing goods and insuring a minimum standard of living for the middle class. While their exact situation may not be repeatable everywhere, there is certainly a lesson in their culture for other nations.<p>You are correct that the Germans have taken advantage of macro-economic imbalances created by the eurozone, but why was it Germany and not France or Greece that has prospered? What is unique about Germany? I would argue it is their culture of hard work, efficient businesses and financial restraint. They do things the right way... why fault them for it?",1327319818
3500045,comment,3496497,3496634,1,0,exDM69,,,"It is certainly valuable to do stuff in CSS instead of Javascript to a certain degree. Especially the small gimmicks that add a little visual touch but isn't part of your core functionality. E.g. some CSS3 transition animations. Doing stuff in JavaScript is slower and more error prone.<p>The recent trend of trying to do everything in only CSS3 without Javascript is mostly a challenge for the developer and some of that stuff serves no actual value. For example, many people have been doing some icons with CSS3, by creating a bazillion elements in the DOM tree and adding CSS3 styles. That serves no practical purpose whatsoever, since the HTML+CSS required probably takes more space than the image it's replacing and is very slow to process and render for the browser.<p>CSS can be used to do practical icons and buttons, though. Instead of trying to create a pixel perfect replica of a bitmap, you can do pretty nice icons by using a nice unicode symbol (or text), and put some rounded corners, a neat gradient and a drop shadow.<p>If only people would stop using absolute pixel sizes in their CSS stylesheets, we could get pretty nice scalable (as in screen size) Web UI's.",1327319810

3500029,comment,3499889,3499992,6,0,swombat,,,"That is a very common ""tech startup world"" meme, and very damaging, in my opinion. Persistence is in fact utterly useless unless you're persisting at the right things.<p>My experience, on the contrary, is that, at least outside the Valley, many founders persist years past the point where they should have given up and done something else instead. And the reason they fail is not that they didn't persist long enough, but that they lack the skills to implement their ideas (usually on the customer development / marketing side). I've seen examples of both skilled founders pulling off apparently boring ideas, and unskilled ones failing at apparently good ideas despite persisting for years.<p>If anything, my observation is that the most reliably successful people I know are not persistent at all - or rather, they're persistent at the overall game of entrepreneurship, rather than at doggedly following a dead startup into the grave. Skilled and experienced entrepreneurs have the guts to recognise that what seemed like a brilliant genius idea 3 months ago is in fact a total waste of time, and do something else instead. The biggest differentiator, though, is skill.<p>Moreover, whereas ""being persistent"" or ""having great ideas"" is a character trait that is quite difficult to change, anyone can learn skills and improve their chances this way.<p>Finally, looking at the example which you picked, Plancast persisted for 2 years - a year and a half after, in the founder's words, ""things began to stall"". That seems reasonably persistent to me. Of course, it's easy to stand on the sidelines and say ""they should have kept trying for longer"" - because it's not your life that's elapsing while they work on that dud startup idea.",1327319306

The contract is created by a legal team that is totally separate from the division hiring you.<p>Generally, a smaller company is more willing to negotiate these terms, since the person doing the hiring is likely to be closer to the person who came up with the contract.<p>I've refused to sign contracts because of draconian IP clauses. I always make sure the contract limits the scope of IP ownership to work done <i>at the request of the employer</i>.

German public opinion didn't want to partake from the almighty Deutsche Mark, which was a rock in troubled seas (the British Pound was crashing, the French Franc was weak, the Italian Lira was losing 20% every 10 years, etc etc); French and Italian elites thought that a common currency would have allowed them to harness the German industrial strength, basically helping themselves to low interest rates they wouldn't have enjoyed otherwise.<p>The German establishment mostly saw the Euro as a straight-jacket, a burden to accept in order to bring about their own reunification, which otherwise would have been opposed across Europe (a reunited Germany would have been dangerously powerful on its own).<p>As it happens, it turned out better for them than for other members; this is why they keep insisting on a monetary approach to public policy that will keep others down, at least until this suites them.",1327319238

From the founders perspective the introduction of the UG (haftungsbeschrnkt) is also great way to found a GmbH on a budget (the needed capital is down to 1, while technically most laws of GmbHs apply), esp. if you are bootstrapping or dont look for external capital right on the start.

But what must have been even worse  and I need to take some blame here  is that while testing I kept submitting the same CAPTCHA over and over and over again. I can picture the poor operator sitting there thinking WTF is this guy doing already?! Then again, maybe they made some quick bucks because recognising the same pattern time and again becomes more efficient.""<p>For the majority of the captcha solving services out there the same captcha is just solved ONCE. When a request is submitted to the API the image data is typically read from the image file and encoded in Base64 or in a similar format. The Base64 string representing the image is then sent to the captcha API.<p>The API will use the Base64 string as a key and check if it exists in a database/key-value store. If it exists, return the value for the Base64 string, if it doesn't exist, send it to one of the available workers. When the captcha is solved by a worker it is saved in the database. If someone would send in the same captcha next time (thus resulting in an identical Base64-encoded string representation of the image), the solved captcha text would just be sent back without any human interference.<p>I talked to one guy running one of these services a while ago and they set it up the following way:<p>1. Requests are sent using JSON to their API.<p>2. The Base64-encoded string representation of the image is checked against Redis to see if it has already been solved. If it has, return it to the client requesting it. Award the person who originally solved it 50% of the fee that the client is paying for it (thus enabling these captcha solvers to earn some kind of passive income).<p>3. If it hasn't been solved, run it through OCR-software. Is the result reliable enough? Save it in redis and return it to the client.<p>4. Is the OCR result not reliable enough? Send it off to a human worker. The worker solves the captcha, the captcha text is saved in Redis as a value associated with the key (the original Base64-representation of the image). Award the worker 75% of the fee the client paid. Return the solved captcha text to the client.<p>5. Deal with invalid captchas (remove entry from Redis, subtract from due commission to worker etc.)<p>6. Rinse and repeat. Scale with more servers + more workers.<p>Pretty cool stuff :D",1327319027

I think that was a poor choice of words on my part.<p><i>For instance, if you have a website that uses AGPL code to produce an HTML page and non-AGPL code to provide a PDF from that HTML page, the two packages would indeed touch, but there would be no obligation to release the non-AGPL code, just the AGPL code.</i><p>Interesting, in your example, if your application calls the AGPL code that is used to generate the HTML wouldn't your application also have to be released under the AGPL? Or do you only have to make available the AGPL ""HTML generation library"" and the changes you have made to it (if any)?<p>I thought that it had already been established that if you use a library under the GPL any code that uses/calls that library must be released under the GPL. The only reason companies can use GPL code server side is because it is not run on the user's machine (technically not ""releasing it""), which was the basis for the creation of the AGPL, to ""fix"" this ""loophole"".<p>edit:<p>Thanks skore, yeah I think your example still stands. Specifically, in the wikipedia article you linked this part:<p><i>By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.</i><p>To continue the original example, if your program just runs the HTML generation program and supplies user data via a command line argument then it need not be released under a compatible license. But on the other hand if you were to ""copy and paste"" the functions from that program into yours, it would need to be licensed under a compatible license.",1327316921

3499922,comment,3495062,3495369,2,0,stan_rogers,,,"A lot of <i>legitimate</i> copyright ownership depends on the ability to assign copyright. It varies by work and by jurisdiction, but the default copyright holder (by statute) is not always the party it should be. In the US, for instance, a corporation's identity might belong by default to the designer, such that they may be able to register trademarks but be prevented from using them freely without copyright assignment. In Canada, the commissioner, not the creator, of a work holds copyright by default, so contracts of commission for things like portraits and weddings photos usually include a copyright assignment clause. (That's actually an improvement over the previous state of affairs, in which the photographer would have to hire the subject as a model for a nominal fee in one contract, then have another contract for purchase and use of the work.)<p>I suppose you could legislate the general condition, but there will always be edge cases. Unfortunately, allowing for edge cases is going to result in abuse.",1327316693

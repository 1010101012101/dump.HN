I don&#x27;t want to work with you, ever. 40 hours a week are for the team, sure, but during the remaining 128 you don&#x27;t have any business in my life. What you propose is creepy.<p><i>25. Be able to take a course online and get graded -- and get a diploma that means something. Education is really ripe for disruption: Coursera is OK, but we need to invent Stanford 2.0</i>
For a diploma to mean something, what you need is not to make the courses better, or harder to pass, or whatever you&#x27;re thinking; what you need is to convince your employer that you have the required skills for your job. The diploma may or may not have something to do with it, but in any case it&#x27;s your employer&#x27;s criterion. What you want may happen over time, but it&#x27;s definitely not a matter of technology.<p><i>26. Be able to sell my advice online. It&#x27;s worth something and I should have some way to monetize it.</i>
Again, it&#x27;s other people, not you, who will judge whether your advice is valuable. Aside from that, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s difficult to become some kind of consultant.<p><i>30. Get a discount from the federal government for being healthy. Fat people should pay more taxes because they cost society more. This means some approved weigh in and testing centers.</i>
What.<p><i>31. Be able to get a $100 MRI. It can be done for this price.</i>
There are a LOT of things that will cost you far, far, far more than what they cost [EDIT: to clarify, that I mean is: far than what they cost <i>to your provider</i>]. This is pretty basic economy, IMHO. Also you may get it for free when you actually need it, if you live in a place with a sane health system (i.e., not the USA).<p>But yeah, as jokoon said in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8648325"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8648325</a>, most of those &quot;problems&quot; arise from politics and economy.

as long as a former collection can be divided into smaller parts

to be combined into a final outcome using an associative combiner.<p>For instance, to compute a count of words,
the former word collection can be either a conc tree in memory
or a file divided in chunks or a bunch of files.
In each case, the sub counts can be computed independently
and reconciled into a total count.<p>The deep insight Guy Steele provides in his talk,
is how to deal with the non trivial cases
like the count of words in a file divided in chunks
where words can cross chunk boundaries.<p>Hence, I highly recommend watching this talk.
As further reading, I recommend too a post [1]
that I written after having watched Guy Steele talk.

You know, the source behind the whole &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; affair.<p>This means that somewhere you have to draw the line.<p>Android has a Linux-kernel, but (from a user&#x27;s point of view) shares near nothing with a &quot;regular&quot; GNU/Linux OS, so it&#x27;s considered an OS of its own. Which I think most people will be fine with.<p>That Debian is a GNU/Linux OS should be beyond any debate.<p>Ubuntu is a plain Debian-derivate. Is it its own OS? It&#x27;s &quot;merely&quot; added a prettier installer, pre-bundled some common firmware and added a new (different) login-manager and GUI shell (Unity) and tried to add some consistent themes on top of that?<p>Elementary OS is (as far as I know) based on Ubuntu. It&#x27;s the same story, except this time they&#x27;re not just changing the shell (Pantheon instead of Unity), they&#x27;re also creating lots og new user-facing GUI applications consistent with their own design-guidelines to compliment it.<p>A user using elementary OS and just the pre-provided GUI-apps a no terminal, will only see components provided by elementary OS. A new OS or just a new GUI? If we accept the principles behind Android being its own OS, this should be too: A user sees nothing of the traditional Linux apps or Linux DEs.<p>If we don&#x27;t accept elementary OS as its own OS, why don&#x27;t we? And if so why do we accept Android as such? You have to draw the line somewhere, and I agree this is hard. But if we accept elementary OS as its own OS, how is this (once built) not?",1416738464

8648347,comment,8645504,8646380,0,0,bostik,,,"The interesting bit is that in addition to scene graph engine, &quot;QML&quot; is actually two slightly different but overlapping things.<p>First - QML is a set of javascript <i>bindings</i> to manipulate the native Qt widgets. In this regard it&#x27;s a bit like Delphi mixed with Smalltalk. You can build and rewrite the UI scenes, using javascript as just the glue language. The more logic is built into the native widgets, the less javascript code will be required for actual UI implementation. (QML requires QtScript, which builds on top of V8. So for random javascript code execution, it&#x27;s reasonably fast.)<p>Second - QML is a declarative scene description language, not entirely unlike CSS. You can embed javascript code to handle dynamic UI updates, which is pretty neat for simple interfaces, and quite nice for prototyping. For anything which requires high frequency and reliable low latency, native widgets are still the way to go. Yes, you can write your own custom widgets; Qt 5.x provides proper development headers so extending the framework is easier than in 4.x days.<p>Technically the scene graph and QML parts are separate. There is quite a bit of history in how the implementations lived and diverged: from a single &quot;declarative&quot; engine to first integrating a scene graph backend, to eventually splitting the QML implementation(s) into their own higher level modules.<p>Disclosure: I had the privilege of working for very propeller-head style Nokia projects where we had direct exposure and visibility to how Qt evolved from its 4.7/4.8 form to the current, modular 5.x rewrite.",1416738127

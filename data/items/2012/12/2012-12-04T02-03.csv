Why would anybody be interested in that, especially children?<p>I learned Japanese as a foreign language in college, and very little time in class was spent on grammar, and not much time was spent on reading/writing. We spent the vast majority of our time on the spoken language, which we learned in the context of simulated real-world conversations. The result was that while we were weak in the written language, our pronunciation and grammar was top-notch.<p>We had no trouble subsequently teaching ourselves the written language (though children might not have the initiative to do that). But if we had not properly learned the spoken language in class and the grammar outside of class at the same time, we might not have had the foundation necessary to progress with the written language.

There's no proof of anything, just a whole bunch of over-exaggerated claims. Does the author really think that people in offices are going to ditch computers entirely and type 15 page documents on a device that has glass so weak if you sneeze on it you risk cracking the screen? No USB ports, so means for connecting multiple external monitors, no CD/DVD/Blu-ray drive, no means of connecting an external drive, lack of internal space, no keyboard...<p>I feel sorry for any business that thinks it's a great idea to stop using PC's and instead opt for expensive tablets with a minimal feature set, investing in potentially tens of thousands of dollars in software and infrastructure to support an office of iPads is not feasible. You know why PC's are the number choice for most businesses, especially in the corporate sector? Because PC's are dirt cheap, cheap to build and upgrade, cheaper software, better support. I've had my Core i5 machine for ages now and I've been able to run games on the highest settings since I built it 2 or 3 years ago. RAM is cheap, new hard drives are cheap, every component of a computer except the CPU is cheap. You can't upgrade the internals of an iPad.<p>As for Office, even Google Docs and Zoho (amongst others) have failed to beat it. Microsoft Office isn't going anywhere for the foreseeable future and the very fact Microsoft have launched cloud versions of Office as well, it's definitely still in wide use and evolving. There are many people who still don't trust the cloud, I don't trust the cloud.<p>It was a nice try, but this is ridiculous. Windows 8 has been out for one month and the author is making extraordinary claims that it has failed to stop the iPad? Windows 8 is not about just capturing the tablet market, it's a great decision from Microsoft to streamline their operating system offering instead of having 15 different versions of an operating system there's only a couple.<p>Remember when journalism used to mean researching and spending sometimes weeks or months on one story?

Its also only the initial connection, as keep-alive is used to eliminate that particular problem with http and https in equal style.<p>Latency issues are real (ie, non-trivial problems), but they are of the nature where context is everything. If you have a small javascript file, then http instead of https will be a multitude faster. If however, you are running a dynamic site, not on a CDN, and are using some kind of javascript goodies, then the experienced latency for users are going to be complex. Add in some banners with ads, and round-trip might not be that relevant at all in the experience of loading the first page. What i am saying is that if latency is an issue, https is not the first place to go the address it.<p>To compare with a real world example, if I load a local news site (round-trip ping of say 30ms), the extra packages of https won't have any direct affect on latency, and the ad-networks from a continent away will be the biggest crime to latency.

But they have the money to, and it's going to be a loss leader to get people to buy other things, like Xbox or in the future their cell phones. Microsoft already co-owns a network with NBC (MSNBC) so maybe they have enough connections to make TV contracts.<p>Pandora/Spotify are bleeding money because of the royalty structure. It's maybe a coin toss if the rates will change. A matter the congress can decide. I think it's worth the gamble. Plus they could leverage this on Xbox too as well as phones.<p>These businesses aren't that profitable which is why I think it makes sense to buy them. Microsoft if they bought all these companies (and if the SEC would allow) would greatly expand their ad network and open up possibilities for new integrations and businesses.  Every other major tech company (Google, Amazon, Apple) has audio/video. Microsoft should want to compete too. I don't see MS Word and being able to run EXEs as enough reason to go Microsoft. I'm imagining them unlocking a wholly integrated entertainment setup.<p>Also, I see MySpace being what it once was. A place to friend all the weird and interesting strangers and follow new bands.

And if you have limited disk space (e.g. a 128GB SSD) - you also lose on that front. (Linux can install comfortably in 4GB; I didn't try to optimize my last Win7 install, I boot it once a month or so to sync my iphone with iTunes, and it's balooned to 15GB somehow without the iPhone data).",1354586837

I had three 21"" HP IPS displays connected to a Mac Pro for a few years and all three of them exhibited tho exact same condition.  The 23"" Apple Cinema Displays we had at my university also did the same thing.  I just chock it up to the IPS display technology, and assume all IPS displays do that to some degree.  IPS is not known for having particularly great pixel twist times, and thats probably related.  That said, I'd still use an IPS display in a heartbeat for the color accuracy.  It's truly phenomenal.

Reports says Mac sales grew only by 5% although these two rates are not comparable because later is % of Mac sales while former is % of PC sales which is much higher
.<p>The reason people used to throw away their working PCs to buy new ones was newer better hardware and hyped up new OS releases. I think PC sales decline is greatly contributed by no new compelling hardware factor. The OS releases of course are less and less compelling because most tasks happens in browser which works fine even on old PCs. If IE was only game in town, people would perhaps still need to get new OS but that's not the case anymore.<p>I guess we are entering new era of PC/Mac refresh cycles were people are going to replace their machines only when it stops working instead of just because new release arrived. People would rather spend $500 on getting a tablet that they don't have than replacing their PC that is already working fine to check emails and browse the web.<p>Interesting thing here is that Wall street analysts would probably going to extrapolate this incorrectly instead of seeing that this is new ""normal"".",1354586672

I'm sure that there are things Disqus does that would show improvements over our homegrown commenting system, but ultimately it just wasn't worth it.

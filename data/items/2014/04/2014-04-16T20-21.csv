7600480,comment,7598721,7599543,6,0,icambron,,,"I don&#x27;t agree with almost any of this.<p>To begin with, I think the reason you don&#x27;t see this as a real language problem is because of status quo bias. Here&#x27;s one way to think about it: your compiler (or interpreter or on-the-fly-IDE-underliner-thing) catches all sorts of syntax mistakes you make. You depend on that. But what if I pulled that all out from under you? Your compiler no longer checks that your function returns the type of thing it says it does in every case and your program just breaks horribly when it doesn&#x27;t. What a terribly stupid thing for your language not to help you with! Well, as you&#x27;d say, you just need to be more vigilant, and it&#x27;s a sign of mediocrity when a developer screws that up. We can extend that to literally every error-mitigation tool we have. In other words, just because you&#x27;ve steeled yourself against this class of error out of practical necessity doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea to leave it around.<p>From the other direction, look at Haskell. I&#x27;m not a Haskell programmer, but my understanding is that its type system and pure functions eliminate entire classes of errors and makes reasoning about the behavior of your program easier. That&#x27;s not programmers being lazy or incompetent. They want their tools to do more thinking for them so they can tackle higher-level problems their tools can&#x27;t, rather than spending their cycles ritualistically ensuring they haven&#x27;t made basic screwups, which humans are intrinsically bad at anyway. People certainly aren&#x27;t attracted to that safety net because they lack the discipline and rigor for the rough-and-ready world of C. Sheesh.<p>There are all kinds of tradeoffs that go into language safety (and you mentioned one-- forcing {} for one-liners makes the code longer and potentially harder to read), but making your language less safe for the <i>express purpose of making it less safe</i> is just crazy. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing when you keep around gotchas to keep out the noobs. Don&#x27;t be the guy who thinks shaving with a straight razor makes him a real man. To push that further, if your measure of the quality of a programmer is how careful they are with syntax gotchas, I submit that you&#x27;re doing it wrong. &quot;Look at this beautifully designed, simple, elegant, fault-tolerant, highly maintainable module our new developer wrote! Oh, but she used an uncommented fallthrough. Fire her!&quot; Being vigilant about little gotchas like this is, I suspect, uncorrelated with all the rest of the stuff you want in a programmer. That her module might be bad in spite of all that points exactly at the tools. If we fix the tools, now her code is awesome, but maybe you won&#x27;t be able to lord your awesome never-mess-up-braces skills over her.<p>It&#x27;s especially interesting that you brought up doctors. Because doctors make mistakes <i>all the time</i> (they only get sued for negligence, which isn&#x27;t just any mistake with nasty consequences). To help with that, they&#x27;ve been steadily improving their tools: EMRs, protocols, checklists, decision trees, standardized equipment layouts, and so on. And it&#x27;s really changed medicine.<p>So I don&#x27;t believe the dichotomy you&#x27;ve set up is right. As applied to the &quot;goto fail&quot; bug, my guess is that the programmer who did it may well have been good, and just made the equivalent of a line-long typo. (Or maybe it was a merge error?) And next time you discover a baffling bug that, in the final analysis, should have been really obvious, I hope your peers cut you more slack then you cut this person.",1397681687

We hired two DBC grads onto my team while I was at WF, and a third after I left. We also interviewed DBC grads who didn&#x27;t make the cut.\nObviously I came to DBC because I believe in what they do. My experience as an engineer on the Wealthfront team was that:\n1. DBC Grads were incredibly driven, hard workers, who had an exceptional ability to &quot;drink from the firehose&quot; and learn what we needed them to learn rapidly. After seeing my first 9 weeks here, it&#x27;s clear that _no other kind of person_ can make it through DBC.\n2. DBC Grads were very effective communicators. I think there&#x27;s a lot of value in DBC&#x27;s &quot;engineering empathy&quot; curriculum.\n3. DBC Grads had a solid enough basis in CS fundamentals and web development to be effective immediately as new hires.\nBoth our DBC hires were adding value right off the bat, and rapidly grew into their role. Wealthfront has a strong mentoring culture, and mentoring had an outsized impact on their ability to grow, because they had already &quot;learned how to learn.&quot; To be honest, they were more independent than some fresh CS grads I know. There&#x27;s no textbook once you&#x27;re in industry.\nWe rejected some DBC grads too. Like in all things, there is a spectrum of talent and ability across DBC graduates.\nIn the end I was impressed enough to leave an incredible team to become an instructor here. Like any junior engineer, graduates of these hacker schools are investments. I happen to think the graduates we produce are particularly good ones.\nIf you&#x27;re curious, here&#x27;s an interview my students did with me about DBC. We talk a fair amount about my experience with our two DBC grads at Wealthfront:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viLYR0kAqAc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viLYR0kAqAc</a>",1397681536

Which I can understand- not everyone enjoys interacting with customers and answering dumb questions like &quot;can you reset my password?&quot;<p>I personally found it really valuable, though.  After the hundredth password reset request, I was pretty motivated to make our password reset function easier to find.  :)<p>Some pitfalls to be aware of, though:<p>1. This only works when the people doing support feel empowered to improve things, either because they can do it themselves or because they feel they are listened to by whoever can.  For example, I can say to our founder over lunch: &quot;People have been complaining about X a bunch this morning.  How about we do Y to address that?&quot;  Then we&#x27;d discuss it, and I could build it that afternoon.  For smaller fixes, it was often just posting on our group chat: &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m fixing A by changing B&quot; and merging it if no one objected.<p>Without this ability, though, it could easily get frustrating.  If you&#x27;re being forced to deal with repeated customer issues you have no power to address, it can feel more and more like an unproductive burden.<p>2. It can have trouble scaling with the complexity of your product.  We were targeting small businesses when I started, and I was able to answer most questions about our product by myself.  As we got bigger, though, and started introducing more complicated features aimed at the needs of larger companies, there were more and more features that I didn&#x27;t have a solid grasp on.  I probably could have kept the whole product in my head a lot longer if I were a full-time support worker, but as a dev I only did 5-10 emails per day,a nd didn&#x27;t have the time to devote to learning some of the more esoteric aspects of our product.<p>3. Not everyone is cut out for customer service.  We tried to hire good developers with personalities we wanted to work with.  That often, but not always, overlapped with the type of communication skills necessary to be an effective support person.  We had a few developers who lacked the patience to deal with slower customers, or weren&#x27;t really good at explaining things clearly to them.",1397680745

I just use it when I need it. I often end up using it as kind of a kludgy logical framework for my research in Linguistics and Type Theory, since I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to use Twelf.<p>Agda deals with IO and mutation in the same way that Haskell does (the IO monad and the State monad); with special directives, these can be compiled down to plain Haskell code. But Agda&#x27;s support for extracting Haskell implementations is pretty wacky and not really mature enough for use (for instance, I have many times had it spit out unbuildable code which I needed to preprocess to get it to work). Idris is a somewhat similar language which is compiled and very easy to run, however.<p>Agda has more support for abstraction & modularity than Haskell by virtue of having a more advanced module system (it has both structures and structures parameterized by values & types, but lacks clean ML-style system of signatures, structures and functors). However, if you are not careful, you will often leak definitional equalities in very dependently-typed code, leading to fragile module boundaries. There are a number of ways to get around this, though; it&#x27;s still an open question how to achieve modularity in the large in an intensional type theory. Homotopy Type Theory clarifies the situation somewhat. Of course, if you&#x27;re just writing Haskell in Agda, then you have strictly more modularity here; it&#x27;s just the interaction with dependent types that can prove tricky.<p>Agda does not support &quot;Type Class Prolog&quot; in the way that Haskell does; it has a limited support for implicit resolution which suffices for overloading, but not so well for doing Haskell-style type class stuff. Eventually, you may find that Modules Matter Most(!), and end up missing Haskell-style type classes much less.",1397679146

But if you make it user-installable (as here), you can sell the exact same camera for maybe $20-30, with only a minimal increase in the cost of production for the modular package.

I&#x27;ve worked with a number of fresh college grads, and I more or less know where they tend to be weak/strong.  The dev bootcamp grad was pretty much the opposite of a college grad.  He was strong with our specific tools (rails), good development practices (scms, tdd, agilish development), and solid communication skills.  However, he was weak with a lot of the stuff you get taught or pick up in college, like programming paradigms, basic algorithms, unix tools, and any domain besides web development.<p>For example, since he knew only ruby, he struggled a lot with js.  I can understand why- when I first learned my second language, I struggled a bit too.  Every language after that becomes a lot easier, of course, because you&#x27;ve learnt how to learn a language.  Since he hadn&#x27;t done that yet, it took longer than expected to ramp up.<p>On the other hand, he was pretty well versed in the rails way to do anything.  He was adamant about our test suite, and would argue for good separation of concerns.<p>If I had to sum it up, I&#x27;d say that college gives you intermediate skills in computer science, and basic skills in the practice of software development.

My (admittedly biased and unscientific) sense is that you really have to be hopeless to flunk out.  The training period is so short that the assignments are necessarily small and limited in scope, so they don&#x27;t test any kind of tenacity or the problem solving and lateral thinking required as a professional.  Granted, University degrees have this same problem, but there at least for a proper CS degree there is some heavy math and theory and exams which over a period of four years will tend to winnow the field a bit more.  Plus, if someone has gone through four years of CS assignments, they should be able to show some kind of programmerly reasoning ability and debugging techniques—if they don&#x27;t at all I think they are pretty easy to write off, whereas someone who has only been coding for 3 months should not necessarily be written off so quickly because they still may need to pass a few eureka moments.<p>I remember my first year of CS after having been generally obsessed with computers and fooling around with programming for over a decade in HyperTalk, AppleSoft BASIC, Pascal and even C.  There was this moment when it just clicked in my head how code was logic manifest.  I know it sounds trite, but there really was this moment where I went from thinking of code as a magic incantation to achieve some result to understanding that code can be anything you imagine, and that you can map your very thoughts to code.  There was some transformation that happened from years of curiosity and obsession, and from what I can tell a lot of people never pass that phase of thinking of code as magic incantations.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s necessary to make that leap, but I&#x27;m fairly certain a 3-month bootcamp will not be sufficient to draw it out for most people.<p>The other problem with bootcamps is that they are just too visible and attractive to people looking for a good career.  I see parallels to Indian outsourcing attempts I was involved in 10-15 years ago.  It was apparent there were a huge number of programmers who had no interest in the craft, but went into the field simply because their parents thought it was a good job.  20 years ago I don&#x27;t think anybody in the US wanted their kids to be programmers, so if someone showed up looking for a programming job they were already most likely brimming with the requisite curiosity to become a passable programmer (even if they weren&#x27;t a genius!).  With the US economy tanking and startup culture being glorified and mainstreamed I feel like bootcamps are the obvious outlet for people seeking the media-fueled romance of being a bonafide Silicon Valley engineer.<p>All of this is a bit unfair to bootcamps.  They may well be the fastest way to learn, and the curriculum may be top notch, but for me personally it&#x27;s a negative signal.  I would be more impressed with a candidate who saved their money and spent 3 months teaching themselves to code using on-line resources.  Perhaps that&#x27;s unfair, but that&#x27;s my bias.  God I would have killed for the web in 1987.  Do you have any idea how much Inside Macintosh (the Mac OS API reference) cost?  Or a C compiler for that matter?",1397678430

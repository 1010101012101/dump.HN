Walking robots seem like they&#x27;re just very hard. Compared to wheeled vehicules, &quot;walkers&quot; touch on a very large number of &quot;frames&quot; (in the sense of Minsky etc). There&#x27;s no reason for a walker if they just use to the safe, level zone of a road and if a walker moves in less structured areas, they need a lot of intelligence to move in a way that&#x27;s useful for people (I&#x27;ve seen a video of BigDog moving through the woods with one soldier guiding via joy but the useful of thing that needs constant attention but can&#x27;t be ridden would be strictly less than that of a horse and that&#x27;s being optimistic it can guided effectively, etc).",1401731768

Rebuilding HDs for 250GB-500GB took a 90 min or so, a 2TB rebuilt takes several hours, all HDs are grinding to recover data at the same time, for hours as well, and this is when you are likely to lose more than the 1 drive and your array.<p>- Consumer and SMB NAS devices tend to buy the hard drives from the same manufacturer, at the same time, so when one drive fails, the other drives are just as likely to fail in the same time period.  I lost two 1TB backups when the HDs had a &#x27;suicide pact&#x27; and when I opened the Hard drives, I saw they were literally made the same day. To be extra paranoid, I used to have 2 or 3 different brand of HDs when I had my NAS.\n- I recommend Synology units and constantly monitor the health of your hard drives. Totally agreed that RAID1 should be the golden standard. I&#x27;ve used several brands and Synology was rock solid.",1401731584

It is more of a quick guide on a number of common server set-ups for mid sized web sites. If you want to learn more about &#x27;how web serving applications work&#x27; I suggest you follow one of the how to guides about setting up a web server of your own and serving up a couple of pages.<p>I actually meant just the hardware aspect of the setup, sorry for the confusion.  That said, I&#x27;m still super interested in how the actual serving works.  The resources you&#x27;ve provided seem to be exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.  Thanks so much for providing those.<p>My experience is in HPC where &#x27;serving content&#x27; actually means &#x27;sending data to other nodes&#x27;.  The upside of this is that in a compute cluster, all the nodes are, usually, in the same room and are actually located very close together.  There&#x27;s still a lot of networking involved in getting the nodes to communicate, but it&#x27;s super interesting to me to see how to scale things on the web where nodes are not necessary even located in the same country!  The example of having the DB and application servers on different machines is a good example.<p>Anyway, sorry for the digression, and thanks again for the links.

7834657,comment,7832783,7834251,1,0,tomp,,,"I totally agree that all communication has a goal/motive; I was referring specifically to advertising/for-monetary-profit communication, mainly because such communication in itself is an indication that the originating party is driven by profit (they are willing to lose money for the chance of convincing you), not by altruism (such as e.g. reading these comments on HN or reading fitness advice on reddit).<p>This also the problem with paid advice (lawyers, fitness trainers, therapists, ...), as the incentives are rarely aligned - the better the service (faster resolution of the problem), the more the customer benefits, and the less the seller earns. Hence, sellers are incentivized to not offer perfect service. Of course, market efficiency is high enough that those who offer really bad service (solve the problems too slowly or not at all) will get a bad reputation, but it&#x27;s reasonable to believe that the optimum for each individual seller (and hence for the market itself) is less-than-perfect-service offered to customers. This is obvious even in fields that are highly regulated, e.g. medicine: most drug research is targeted to managing long-term diseases (HIV, cancer), so that the customer stays a customer as long as possible; one-shot medicine (e.g. for snake bites) are &quot;priced out&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s even worse in politics; politicians can promise anything, get elected, do the opposite, and blame the opposition.<p>On the other hand, the incentives online are different. There is no money, only reputation, good feelings (altruism) and lulz. Therefore, you need a &quot;bullshit-test&quot; to filter out the trolls (e.g. upvoting, reputable peer-reviewed blogs), but if you do that successfully, the incentives of producers and consumers of information are aligned.<p>Finally, this is only my thinking and analysis of the state of the world; I might be wrong, and I encourage you to point out any errors in my thinking and change my mind.",1401730212

So instead of paying $30 for internet I&#x27;m paying $20, and to one of the few people who can possibly yell at the lazy internet vendor to fix things or to management to lower the price. Now, of course, she won&#x27;t. So what if the login page is broken (or doesnt work with any iOS or Android browsers) or if the speeds are terrible. She got her $20, you got the backdoor employee login, and now the regular guests continue to suffer.<p>Even after my bribe/complaints/payment I&#x27;m stuck with yet another sub 1mbps internet that is literally useless to me.  I just end up using the LTE tethering on my phone and minimize my usage so I dont hit my 5gb cap.  I travel 6-7 times a year, usually to nice hotels, and am constantly shocked at how terrible the internet service is.  Ironically, the cheap Super8 or Holiday Inn tends to have faster and cheaper/free service compared to the nicer hotel. Before my wife and I could afford nice hotels, we had much fewer internet issues. I imagine those cheaper outlets are actually competing for the dollar, while the fancier chains know that Joe Business traveler doesn&#x27;t care about $20 a night internet because his company is paying for it anyway.<p>Worse, some hotels advertise &#x27;free wifi&#x27; but once you show up you get a login page that tells you that 256kbps is free and if you want full speed its $20 a night.  256kbps is useless to me.<p>Has anyone started a wifi wall of shame yet? I was going to setup a small wordpress or drupal site just to post my speed results to warn other travelers, ask others to contribute, but the only time I&#x27;m motivated to do that is when I&#x27;m in the hotel frustrated, and of course then, the internet is far to slow to develop a new site on.<p>The real question is why is hotel management culture so broken and blind to the basic needs of their travelers. Imagine if the bathroom had a per use toilet paper fee and the paper was over-priced and of low quality. Would we stand for that? Hell, I&#x27;m going to start that site tonight.

Even if you don&#x27;t have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets. Job Responsibilities<p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time. Job Qualifications<p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients&#x27; requirements by asking good questions, for example.<p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.<p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired. On the front-end, HTML 5 and CSS experience is required.<p>Knowledge of some or all of the following specific tools and technologies is a plus:<p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n    Tools: Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Hudson, etc.), static code analysis (Sonar, etc.), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n    Web: vert.x, Play, Spring, Django, Rails, node.js, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile or similar\n    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), cloud servers, Linux configuration, application servers (Resin, etc.)\n    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL (CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) \n</code></pre>\nWe like technical people who are not afraid to have strong opinions about technology but simultaneously keep an open mind and are flexible enough to work with whatever technology the task at hand requires.<p>That said, we&#x27;re mostly looking for great developers who are great to work with. If you don&#x27;t have experience with everything listed above (and who does?) but are still a solid developer eager to learn new things, you might be a great fit here.<p>Please apply here: <a href=""http://jobs.techempower.com/hn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn</a>",1401729379

It&#x27;s a LAMP stack with init script to load the webapp from git repo.<p>Customer logs in at username.mywebapp.com<p>The beauty of this is that I never have to worry about things breaking or becoming a bottle neck. if one customer outgrows themselves, they won&#x27;t affect other resources. It has linear scalability, new customers, add a new droplet.

I could host it even on Amazon S3 but currently using cloudflare.<p>Updating the product code requires me to restart the droplet instance. However, I test things out on another staging droplet.

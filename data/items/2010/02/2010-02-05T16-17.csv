1103998,comment,1102540,1102687,0,0,Groxx,,,"Note: I'm not a physics major, much less in any exotic physics.  I've just been reading stuff like this for a long time, it interests me.  Expect errors, but I typically find later evidence means I'm at least nearly correct in understanding the concepts.  And please, anyone correct me where I'm wrong, I'd be interested in correcting my own misconceptions.<p>First, an information theory primer (for you or others who don't know):<p>What it seems to be saying is based partially off information theory's view of the universe, where <i>everything</i> is merely information.  This has the nice quality of simplifying a LOT of things.  That apple, up in the tree?  Information.  That apple, falling?  A change in information.  That charged capacitor storing a 1?  Information.  Even an electron changing energy levels around an atom is a change in information.  The key part is that, because of thermodynamics, any change in information can <i>only</i> maintain or increase the entropy of a system.<p>The alternative, more classical view is to see information and matter as separate, or even ignore information, but the same rules apply in an enormous amount of situations, and quantum mechanics casts doubt on the nature of matter anyway.<p>So, motion, energy, matter, everything is information, and <i>information</i> cannot be created or destroyed (see how nicely it plays with Einstein?).  This touches on one of the problems for information theory, in that black holes seem to be a net loss, not merely a change.  Info goes in, and it never comes out, in any form (hawking radiation doesn't appear to reveal anything about what's in the black hole), and the black hole can vanish, taking all the info with it.  There are loads of was to resolve this, but the one important one here seems to be coming from a link in the article [1], essentially saying that, in the same way a hologram stores 3D info in a 2D (ish) material (in information theory, it's actually 2D), the black hole displays all the information about what's inside it (3D matter) via the event horizon (a 2D boundary) as a holographic surface, thus it's not ""lost"" when it vanishes.<p>I don't fully understand holographic principles, so I just won't touch on how that directly applies to this idea.  The important thing here is that, with the above, they seem to be saying that gravity can be viewed as a change in information, and thus maintaining or increasing entropy.  As entropy cannot decrease, some changes in that information are more likely (somehow, the article doesn't touch on it), with mutual attraction being the most.  This all happens on a 2D holographic surface, which is <i>displayed</i> as our 3D world.  The linked article covers it a bit better.<p>I can't even begin to guess at the math involved, but it seems to be fairly consistent with a lot of other theories, as well as internally consistent.  It could also explain why gravity is so frickin' hard to accurately account for, if mutual attraction is merely most <i>likely</i>. (we don't have a working equation, just ones that are ""close"".  Newton was amazing for the time, Einstein refined it further to a huge degree, but we still can't truly accurately predict it)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html?full=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world...</a>",1265389184

Do you agree with and support everything the United States does? I'm going to assume you said no to that (if yes, then I'm arguing with a crazy person). And do you think any one person in the United States agrees with everything the United States government does? It would be <i>extremely</i> unlikely if it does happen, and even if it does happen, the US government has the possibility of veering away from that person. This is because the US government is a distinct entity formed when the mob of people come together. Unlike your computer, it does not act exactly as you do.<p>Remember the focus is not on the company, it's on what the company creates when it is a formation of a bunch of people. It creates a distinct entity which usually ends up being a compromise of its constituents wishes. People act differently in a group, they can lose their humanity, and usually there's less responsibility for misdeeds. This thing the mob creates should <i>in no way be treated on the same level as any individual constituent of it</i>. This is because, as I have tried to show you, it is not simply a vessel of any single human being.",1265389063

1103991,comment,1103465,1103465,0,0,dkimball,,,"I wouldn't imagine there's much of a market for small-arms design. It's an old-school, natural-monopoly sort of subject, one of those for which the slow, careful, bureaucratic model that Paul Graham (correctly!) condemns for software was originally devised.<p>So I'd expect three things to drive down the value of small-arms designers: the point that variable costs are much higher than fixed ones in small-arms manufacturing; the presence of bureaucratic inertia in the militaries and police agencies who represent the main customers; and the fact that the problem domain is very well-understood and has been for quite some time. The AK-47 is showing its age, but is still viable; the H&K G3, the FN FAL, and the M-14 are all around 60 years old (the M-16 is a newcomer at 50 years, and the ""space-age"" bullpups, the Steyr AUG and SA80, are around 30); and the Colt M1911 was designed before the First World War and, from what I understand, is still one of the best pistols on the market.<p>There are a few ""cutting-edge"" weapons that are just coming into use -- the Tavor and the H&K G36, most obviously -- but I think these reflect a change in the perceived threat environment more than an advance in technology.<p>So, in other words: I'm not sure that there's very much to _do_ in the field of small-arms design. There are some small, innovative companies in the field -- Calico Light Weapons Systems is an obvious one -- but the problem with being a small, innovative manufacturer of firearms is that you don't have much of a market. Even when Bill Clinton _isn't_ in office, private citizens will never spend the kind of money on small arms that governments do.<p>I want to emphasize that I'm coming at this from the perspective of an interested amateur, and my interest is more in infantry tactics than in the weapons they use to implement them -- so there may be factors here that I don't know about. I'd second the recommendations by hga and gexla: contact people who know more about this, but, I'd say, prepare to be a little disappointed. (Aerospace engineering strikes me as being a field which is still evolving, and thus ought to be more promising for someone with an interest in designing weapons systems.)",1265389051

Economic gains do not equal what we lose in community.  We should discourage some necessary conditions for meritocracy (e.g. mobility) to promote traditional symptoms of community/culture (e.g. immobility).<p>I don't agree with the article, but I enjoyed the cognitive dissonance.  I think economic gains more than make up for whatever we've lost, and society is adapting to preserve the things that really matter in new ways.

1103980,comment,1103639,1103639,0,0,fab13n,,,"House prices also raise because we have more unaffected money:<p>- food represents a smaller and smaller proportion of our expenses;<p>- manufactured goods also became more affordable, as they're produced either by robots or by 3rd world workers;<p>- double-income families have become the norm.<p>Since the housing market is essentially an auction system, with limited offer elasticity, it's natural that it swallows a large chunk of what could have been our disposable money growth.<p>Now, there are other factors, especially in the USA, which will evolve:<p>- the gold rush on estate as a speculative investment undoublty caused a bubble (although it only explains part of the price explosion). This seems now largely over.<p>- by accepting to lend to everyone, banks have artificially increased the number of potential buyers, hence further increasing the prices reached by auctions.

Readers of his blog frequently seek his opinions about video game hardware and software.  As it has done in the past, the manufacturer of a newly released video game system sends the student a free copy of the system and asks him to write about it on his blog.  He tests the new gaming system and writes a favorable review. Because his review is disseminated via a form of consumer-generated media in which his relationship to the advertiser is not inherently obvious, readers are unlikely to know that he has received the video game system free of charge in exchange for his review of the product, and given the value of the video game system, this fact likely would materially affect the credibility they attach to his endorsement.  Accordingly, the blogger should clearly and conspicuously disclose that he received the gaming system free of charge.  The manufacturer should advise him at the time it provides the gaming system that this connection should be disclosed, and it should have procedures in place to try to monitor his postings for compliance.

Tell your children they can be whatever they want, and then let them follow whatever they're good at.  Even if it's plumbing or retail.

I don't like 'backchannels', what I have to say can stand the light of day.<p>> As I see it, #startups is a channel which has very smart people involved in the startups community including many people working for YC companies.<p>Nobody denies that.<p>> As the channel is realtime we have the great opportunity to point others to interesting stories before they will go to hackernews and see what's new themselves.<p>Which is fine up to a point, and that's where our disagreement probably begins.<p>> Certainly not all people will just up vote articles blindly without seeing if it's actually a good article.<p>But some do, and it is more than enough to make a noticeable difference, and not always for the better.<p>If it were <i>always</i> for the better that would be one thing but plenty of times the upvotes are based on 'who' and not on 'what'.<p>Invariably the biggest effort to 'upvote' centers around self posts by the people from #startups, even when their stuff is pretty lame.<p>It rarely happens that the power of #startups is used to 'rescue' a really good post from falling of the new page without upvotes, but it does occasionally happen.<p>> Just like I think swombat's response was good, I gave him an up vote.<p>That's fine with me. But let's be fair here, there has been enough 'anti jacquesm' sentiment on #startups to fill a couple of buckets with. The reason why I decided to post that bit of log is simply because I'm being told to my face I'm making this up while it's happening right under my nose.<p>For the record, I started hanging out in #startups after receiving several emails with a bunch of stuff that was said behind my back, so I got curious what you guys are up to, this was right after some weird emails to my address regarding HN and I figured maybe that's where the source lies.<p>> If you sticked around in our channel longer you would know that we often joke about taking money and ""giving free upvotes"".<p>You joke about it, and at the same time there is plenty of it happening. If everybody on HN would hang out in #startups it would be a different thing, elsewhere in this thread someone claims that<p>> The folks on #startups are the HN community.<p>but that would be off by at least two orders of magnitude.<p>> Hiding in the channel anonymously and posting the logs on this channel is exactly why people get annoyed with the content you submit which in turn results in calling names (which I should also apologize for) in an informal semi-private setting..<p>I think you have the order confused here, I first received a bunch of logs by email which suggested that there was a fairly concerted effort to downvote my stuff, no matter whether it was on topic or not. This has happened to more than one person on HN, so my feeling at the time was that #startups is not only used to promote content but also to squelch certain individuals.<p>I'm not sure about the latter, but given some of the stuff said in #startups and the resulting votes on those comments I would conclude that the accent is on upvotes but that group-downvotes definitely do happen if only occasionally.<p>If you have absolutely never ganged up on someone in a group setting then of course this does not apply to you.<p>> The people in the channel submit interesting and relevant articles on regular base and I think those submissions are one of the main reasons I visit this site on a daily base.<p>There is plenty of stuff submitted by others, that do not hang out in #startups that sinks without a trace, if you wanted to upvote interesting stuff then you could do that by basically scanning the new page every couple of hours.<p>#startups is for the most part limiting the bundling of upvotes to a relatively small group of people.<p>There are two positive effects from the group there, the one is flagging spam, the other is to upvote interesting articles, but as I said elsewhere that is the beginning of an arms race that eventually will spiral out of control.<p>I can probably muster plenty of upvotes because of the people on HN that I know or have met but I would <i>never</i> ever dream of doing that.<p>I once mailed someone about something I wrote and it was immediately interpreted as 'oh, I'll vote your stuff up', I never did that again.<p>> the channel is certainly part of the solution and not the problem. We submit good content, why worry about the way it happens?<p>I'm not sure that I'm able to explain this well enough, but let me try:<p>When a society forms, around a theme or some set of common interests the idea is that the 'one man one vote' principle will guide that society to stay on the rails.<p>If a small group of people, even with the best of intentions starts to control a dis-proportionally large part of the conversation we are well under way to 'stage 2', which will culminate in people using voting rings, botnets and all kinds of other strategies to drown out each other in the battle for control of the homepage.<p>Already there is substantial code in the HN core to deal with that sort of thing.<p>You are accelerating that process, and possibly the decline.<p>I think this falls under 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions'.",1265388157

(2.2) extend the highlight of the current navigation item to the far right of the navigation box, so that it ""touches"" the content (tabs are always ""connected"" to their content, and you're basically doing vertical tabs here)<p>(3) get rid of the ""links"" headline and the bullet points in the navigation (css is your friend there)<p>(4) whitespace is your friend, even in the example images - the right example looks very crowded. read the osx interface guidelines (or, less preferrably, the gnome one) for examples of good interface<p>(5) distinguish _somehow_ between internal and external links in the navigation. i first thought that that was the difference between bold and non-bold entries in the navigation - but apparently, it's not.<p>disclaimer: i'm not a designer by trade, this is just what i picked up during my studies (independently and on university) and by working together with designers<p>if you want a good introduction to design and a good read at the same time, read ""design of everyday things"" and look for slides of user interface design lectures - many teachers put them online!<p>hope that helped",1265387440

A lot of designers I work with use graphic design as a crutch for their inability to understand true elegant web design (hence why I will never subcontract a designer that ""does primarily print work and web design on the side"").<p>In all honesty, a programmer is more capable of devising and creating an elegant and magnetic site design for one primary reason: a programmer grasps the underlying technology and capabailities (hell, it's programmers that made Photoshop possible!).

In this context, a statist is one who favors the state or equivalently, a statist prefers to solve social problems by relying on force rather than cooperation.<p>It seems to me that most people don't think in these terms. They don't distinguish between the state and everything else. Rather they think pragmatically: ""How can I have a better life?"" or ""What's good for my country?"" Lessig seems to fall in this group. So for example, he sees that copyright law is not encouraging an innovative society, and therefore he wants to change the law. Or he sees that government is acting in the best interest of corporations rather than ""ordinary"" folks and so he tries to change that. He's not thinking in terms of strengthening or weakening the ""coercive institution of the state.""<p>Analogous situations: Most web developers think in terms of solving technical problems, ""how can I get this page to look a certain way?"", rather than being standards compliant. Most  general consumers think in terms of comfort, convenience, value, etc, rather than ""green"" (what's good for the environment) or patriotically (buy American).<p>So when Lessig is called a statist, he is being characterized in the framework implied by the term, which is not the framework in which he thinks.",1265386208

and
<a href=""http://kuler.adobe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuler.adobe.com/</a><p>The next step after color is Typography. You don't need to get into all the nitty gritty crap about it but choose some good fonts normally something very clean and simple is your best bet. ie Arial, Helvelica, Verdana (used on this site) and Georgia. When you get into other fonts its very easy to use them incorrectly. For example you do not want to use Georgia as body text its to hard to read but it makes great headlines.<p>After those two changes the third is the hardest, making things feel well designed. Take a look at how other people have done similar things. A great site for this is <a href=""http://patterntap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patterntap.com/</a><p>Just because something is simple/spare/plain does not mean it cannot look good.

I can't find the study now, so I could be full of it :-)<p>Actually, shifting to off-peak is a good outcome since fewer spinning reserve plants (usually the least efficient) are needed.  But, as you say, not really the desired outcome.<p>My baseline use tends to run at about 300W.  We first did obvious things like replace some of our lighting with CFL, and we got rid of an old chest freezer we didn't need.  We changed behavior through learning to turn off lights when we left a room.  There were some no-brainer things (my stereo apparently allows multi-room hookups, and if you have the buttons turned on, it uses several hundred watts to do nothing.  I replaced a fileserver + routers with an Apple Time Capsule and saved 100+ watts.  We use the dryer differently.  And we installed a few BITS smart strips.  The reason our savings are high is partly because I live in the Boston area, where our electricity rate is currently $0.19/kWh, I think.  Bottom line was that we made a lot of little changes.  I have written about most of them in my personal blog, called fivepercent.us if you're interested.",1265385952

The pygmoid features are the product of convergent evolution. The evolutionary trend towards small stature seems to be due to resource competition from living on an island with barely enough space to support human habitation.

Even if your system can tell that a user is quite likely to fall in the '5' camp, the only safe prediction for a high variance movie is something close to the middle.  Even if you are pretty sure the user would give this movie a 5, the squared error for the small chance of a 1 is enormous.<p>But a rating close to the middle is never going to be chosen  as a recommendation if the algorithm involves recommending the movies with the highest predicted scores.  Instead, an RMSE based system is always going to prefer safe 4's over risky 5's.  This doesn't mean that improved predictions can't yield improved recommendations, but I don't see truly great ones ever coming from a prediction based approach.<p>Personally, I want a recommendation system that maximizes the percentage of recommendations that I would rate as 5's, and don't much care if the misses are 1's, 2's, or 3's.",1238431036

It is remarkably ""natural"" for a Korean person to try speaking English to a Japanese person (even though Korean and Japanese are cognate languages), and it is more expected still for a Chinese person to speak with either of them in English. What I find remarkable, but have observed more than once, is speakers of different Sinitic languages (""Chinese dialects"") speaking to one another in English. Online, which is mostly the context Jeff is talking about in his blog, the early inconvenience of typing in the CJK languages (now resolved, as an in-country issue, but still a big barrier to switching among those languages) resulted in much Internet communication in east Asia being in English by default.<p>After edit: France was mentioned in the reply above to which I reply here, and I'll mention that the Carrefour retail chain has stores in Taiwan, and the signs inside the stores are in Chinese, of course, but also in English, NOT in French. There is no reason of national pride among the Carrefour staff sufficient to overcome the practicality of using English to reach customers in Taiwan. (Taiwan has a large population of English-speaking foreigners, the plurality of whom are Philippine guest workers.)",1238430544
538705,comment,538464,538607,0,0,dasil003,,,"I sort of see where you're coming from in terms of the parity mismatch between RDBMSs and typical application code.  Certainly we can avoid some coding headaches by just dumping things into a data store that is optimized for what we want to do with that data right now.  But then you say that most applications have a well-defined data model and rarely run ""queries"".  This is where I think you've gone terribly terribly wrong.<p>The value of a relational database is that it most agnostically represents the reality of what the data represents.  It's not about ""big piles of data"" or ""making sense of your data"", relational databases are about making your data as expressive as possible.  You're selling this idea that most applications only use data in a few predefined ways.  I have to say that sounds like a complete pipe dream.  Requirements change all the time.  Reporting needs often are not even conceived until you have hundreds of megabytes of data.  Let's not even get into multiple applications using the same database.<p>In every business I've ever been involved with, the data is always more valuable than the code, and it always outlives the code.  Too much of the hype around these alternative database technologies are throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  The idea that ""most"" applications don't need structured data just strikes me as incredibly naive and short-sighted.  Far more applications need structured data than need to scale.",1238430534

This development is very logical for both parties - Y Combinators get believable partnerships to show potential portfolio companies and VCs get the heavy lifting of sourcing & screening offloaded.<p>My point is this - and has always been this - if traditional / non-profit incubators do not offer a way for their clients to get both Validation and Money, then the traditional Incubators will be diminished in their appeal.<p>And, at the same time, if traditional incubators do offer a method to provide Validation and Money to their client companies, they will prosper because of the inherent operating advantage of a local incubator.<p>The most expensive and labor intensive parts of the Seed stage of Risk investing are: Sourcing, Screening and Post Investment Oversight of the Seed company.<p>This is what an Incubator does !<p>The incubator should be compensated for this by a Fund that then delivers funding and validation on a worldwide basis to those incubator clients that are worthy of investment.<p>Hopefully, this will lead to worthy seed companies getting the validation and money they need at reasonable terms based on a discount from Series A - as opposed to XYZ % upfront.<p>Hopefully, this will lead to incubators generating good returns from their compensation for providing sourcing, screening and oversight.

High levels of serotonin are associated with the 'builder' type (managerial, traditional, stubborn).<p>So by taking SSRIs to hack your brain's level of shyness you might actually end up dampening your entrepreneurial vibes and becoming a middle-manager. Crazy, huh.",1238429338

We are used to translating bad english and have no trouble with statements like this:<p><i>In the early part of the 1950's in the USA, a game called ""Violence Fight"" was in vogue among mafia, reckless drivers and general businessmen. The ""Violence Fight"" was the game to struggle for ""No. 1 Quarreler"" with fighters who were gathered from all parts of the USA speaking boastingly of their strength. And of course a lot of winning money as well as the honor were given to the ""winner"".</i><p>(Example taken from here <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnBWgrSt30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnBWgrSt30</a>). Other languages (e.g. french) just don't tolerate stuff like this.<p>For an example of a really easy to learn language, see modern Turkish. For various reasons (vacations and chicks) I've tried and failed to learn many languages. I came closest with turkish, vocabulary was my only sticking point. Ataturk simplified the language only 70 years ago, and it worked fantastically well.",1238429186

It is hubris to think otherwise -- an arrogant sort of laziness of thought which is entirely different from the productive laziness that programmers generally cultivate.<p>A programmer who cannot talk to his colleagues and customers, and blames his inadequacy on them, is a failure at his profession : writing code which <i>solves problems for people</i>.  If you only get as far as ""writing code"" without understanding the people and their problems, congratulations, you fail.<p>On the plus side, the prevalence of attitudes like this means you can do pretty well for yourself if you're bilingual.  I got stopped on the train today by the guy who got me my current job (random coincidence -- we live in adjacent small towns).  He started the conversation like he always does ""Hey, Patrick, how's work?  Say, do you know any bilingual engineers looking for employment?""<p>This week apparently its an aerospace project that needs them.  Its always something -- there's hundreds of billions in trade happening between the US and Japan every year, huge portions of it are high-tech, and engineers here are only marginally better at speaking English than engineers in America are at Japanese.

For me,  Prozac had the side effect of extra-sensory perception:  I couldn't do anything without having immediate karmic effects on people I knew who lived hundreds of miles away.  I'd be sitting in bed talking to my wife about (essentially unpredictable) events that would happen to take place the next day.  People think they might want those kind of powers,  but you can count me out.  I lasted about a week,  but it took most of a month for the metabolites to wash out of my system.<p>One tablet of lexapro causes my interest in sex to disappear entirely for a week.  Personally I think this simplifies my life,  but three days of sleeplessness is quite a price to pay.<p>A friend of mine started taking Effexor,  but then we found accounts of how it's impossible to stop taking Effexor:  blood-curdling stories about pharmacists who'd dissassemble the pills and reassemble them to titrate the dose down,  and who'd still be unable to get the dose to zero.  He stopped in three days,  before the damage was done.<p>Anyhow,  all of those drugs affect serotonin metabolism,  as do the 5-HT2A agonists that some people call psychedelics or entheogens.  Alexander Shulgin did a 30-year research program on psychedelic phenethylamines (drugs structurally related to dextroamphetamine,  mescaline and ecstacy) and found that certain drugs in that family have a synergism with alcohol much like what the author of that article describes.",1238428800

He is just trying to sell another religion. What I have noticed, TDD is being pedled heavy by RoR contracting shops that just care about billable hours and not vested if the startup or company is going to make it on the long run.  I see often that it is the usually youngish and guidable engineers that fall in the trap of eating it up. TDD is something that makes younger and less experienced developers feel good (more locs) and a false sense that the code is correct while there is solid data that even 100% unit testing coverage finds only 20% of defects, at best.<p>Having shipped many world class products, and none of the processes that build those products had any resemble of TDD in them. So, to all the pragmatists out there feel free to ignore the advice on the article. I'd yet to hear a super successful startup that used TDD.<p>Having Tested Code (which is a good goal) != TDD.  TDD to me is putting the carriage in front of the horse. Anybody that have created large systems from scratch, TDD is a major slowdown on the refining process. Your job is to SHIP a working product. Testing is only a small part of it, and its positives should be considered alongside its negatives and side effects on the shipping timelines.<p>Having worked for over 10 years in the industry I have to meet any great programmer that preferred TDD. I hate to attack the author, but from his bio he seems a bit like a process peddler.  I don't see him have worked on any successful startups, or anything that had a good exit.  So take his claims with a grain of salt.

I debug using Firebug, mainly using the DOM view, the console and the JavaScript REPL. Then I might change my credentials to see the page as a different user, for example. I clear the cache now and then, and I clear my cookies often. I also change things like cookie preferences and turn JavaScript on/off to see how my app behaves. I also work on multiple projects concurrently, so I frequently need to switch, meaning yet again to clear the browser state.<p>In other words, I <i>need the browser as a clean slate</i>. I frequently need to throw its state away, and I rarely if ever run pages as ""myself"".<p>I'm a Chrome user, so for this reason I currently use Firefox as my dedicated debug browser. This means I can always throw away my browser state, and I can close Firefox when I'm done with work. Firefox is a resource hog on OS X, and will frequently sit consuming 5-10% CPU even when idle, so this is actually important. I almost never use Chrome for debugging, not just because its DOM view and console are both much worse than Firebug's, but because it's my browser. (Yes, I know that Chrome supports per-window profiles, but Chrome just isn't good enough for debugging.)<p>My ideal development tool would be a thin shell around a web browser component. It would be chock full of techy dev stuff, and it would not compromise the dev aspect in favour of user-friendliness; unlike today's browsers, everything could be provided natively by the tool instead of inserted awkwardly by ""extensions"". It would do away with user-facing features like browser extensions, fancy history and bookmarks. In other words, it would be a hard core, bare-bones development tool.<p>This tool would support ""projects""; each project being is a browser window, and each browser window is logically compartmentalized, with its own cookie database, history, settings, etc., with the option to save certain things like cookies, so that I can ""bake"" current browser state and recall it later. The ideal solution would be for each window to be able to embed different browser engines; there is no particular technical reason why this should not work, although it would be a little more work to implement.<p>I actually started writing an app like this for OS X that embeds WebKit. It was surprisingly simple, and I got a decent DOM inspector view and style editor working, but then my mind wandered off to work on something else.

The only EU country that used egg-washing was Sweden (where about 50% of eggs were washed), and producers who washed them sold them as ""class B"" eggs.<p>In 2004, the EU merged class B and class C, and forbid selling class B eggs directly to consumers. This would have banned washed table eggs, so Sweden objected. In response, the European Commission passed a derogation where egg producers who already washed eggs can continue to do so, for 3 years, provided they are authorized by the national food and safety agency, and sold in areas where that agency has jurisdiction (<a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?mode=dbl&lang=en&ihmlang=en&lng1=en,en&lng2=bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv,&val=286903:cs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?mode=dbl&lang=en&...</a>). I.e., Swedish producers can sell washed eggs in Sweden.<p>In 2005 a safety study was commissioned, which turned out positive: ""Taking into account the very low prevalence of Salmonella spp. in Swedish egg production, the risk associated with egg washing using the current system under strict rules is considered to be outweighed by the advantages of egg washing.""

I've played about a dozen sessions with several rounds each, so I've had the chance to play full rounds as well as entering part way through rounds, and I've certainly experienced my share of building up power and dying. I think the game would be no fun if you didn't lose stuff when dying. It wouldn't take long for everyone to build up max powerups, and then it would just be a bombs everywhere shitshow with very little going in the way of tactics or overall strategy. In addition, losing power ups is a <i>huge</i> incentive to avoid dying. In fact, it's the only reason I care.<p>I agree, however, that it can be really frustrating to spend a precious several minutes farming or searching for power ups only to lose it all in a freak accident, an unlucky wall spawn, or even just getting outplayed by someone. I think somewhere in between would be the best of both worlds -- maybe losing about a third to a half of your power ups would be a good balance. Then you don't lose all the fruits of your efforts in an instance but the incentive to not die is still strong. Yet dying will still happen frequently enough that the overall level of power ups that people have will be low enough to keep game play fun and reasonable.",1362512682

There are a few reasons.<p>First, yes, TDD slows you down. The reason this matters is because a lot of our time as developers is spent exploring ideas, and it's pretty well understood that the faster you can get feedback on your ideas the easier it is to creatively develop them. In fact, the final result of your creative process can be completely <i>different</i> depending on the feedback cycle you have. From the micro to the macro perspective, religious TDD introduces an constant factor slowdown for small projects that yes, ends up being a net win in the long run if you live with the code for long, but is a net loss in the short run and also can <i>prevent</i> you from finding a solution to a problem since your creativity is stifled by the slow speed of idea development.<p>Second, when building web applications, building tests turns out to be fairly overrated. First, people will tolerate most bugs. (Write good tests around the parts they won't.) Second, if you have a lot of traffic, bugs will be surfaced nearly instantly in logs and very quickly via support tickets/forum posts. (What if there are bugs that don't make it into the logs and don't affect people? If a tree falls in a forest...) Much more important than mean time between failures is mean time to recovery. I'd rather have ten bugs that I fix within 5 minutes of them affecting someone than one bug that festers for a month. Not only because this is healthier for the code base in terms of building robustness, but also because human behavior is such that many fast bug fixes make everyone feel good but few lingering bugs make everyone miserable. People want to feel like you care, and are much more likely to feel cared for when you fix their problems quickly, and are not often interested in just how few bugs you ship if the one that you do has been affecting them for a month.<p>This isn't theoretical nonsense, it's a very real phenomenon where you use tests and manual testing to get up to a basic working prototype and then just throw it over the fence to flush out the bugs. It's the only way to do it anyway. (This only really works if you have traffic and can deploy changes quickly. To paraphrase a colleague, production traffic is the blood of continuous deployment.) Obsession over deploying bug-free software (an oxymoron anyway) is usually coming from people who haven't gotten over the fact that we don't need to ship software once a month or once a year but can do it every 10 minutes in certain domains. Instead of focusing on not shipping bugs, focus on shipping faster.",1362512485

One clear trend is every manufacturer believes that a high end flagship phone with a 4.3 inch or larger LCD with HD resolution of 1920X1080 and at least a 1.5 Ghz processor is mandatory. These flagship smartphones may have been introduced early to preempt Samsungs Galaxy S4 announcement.

5326752,comment,5325257,5326389,6,0,bad_user,,,"There's not much value in learning programming languages that are similar. If you learn Ruby, you already know pretty much everything there is to know about Python. If you learn Java, you already know much about C#. The only real value you can get out of learning new mainstream languages is from learning the architecture of popular libraries. Like when I was inspired a few years ago to do database migrations after I played around with Rails.<p>So you end up learning from the libraries written in those languages, not the languages themselves. It isn't a bad outcome, especially since learning a new language that's similar to something you already know becomes second nature and doesn't take too long. It takes me something like 2 weeks to learn a new language.<p>Haskell is on a whole new level though. I don't know Haskell, but in the last couple of months I've been building stuff with Scala and lots of functional programming related idioms, both for personal stuff and for our startup and I've learned more than I learned in the last 5 years. There's lots of good stuff to learn in the Scala ecosystem, like how to build rock solid pieces of functionality with referential transparency, how to work with Futures/Promise, how to do concurrency with shared-transactional memory, how to do non-blocking and safe I/O using Iteratees, how functional data-structures are designed and so on.<p>Of course, Scala is tainted by its hybrid and JVM-related nature. It's much too easy to cheat if it's easier than alternatives that are referentially transparent and even if your interface is pure, that interface is probably wrapping something which isn't pure. In practice it works great for building stuff, but unfortunately I'll have to take the plunge and learn Haskell to be able to take my knowledge to the next level.<p>One example where Scala falls short is in its implementation of lazy data structures. You see, even though Scala does have really good lazy data structures, it cheats here and there because it makes sense to do so ... like for instance a Stream is a lazy list and it does behave lazily, except when it doesn't. <i>sort()</i> on a lazy stream is actually implemented eagerly, which means algorithms using <i>sort()</i> will not have the complexity characteristics of lazy algorithms. There's nothing stopping one from implementing a lazy sort() in Scala, but it's probably not going to have any benefits so people don't do that. That's actually the reason why I want to learn Haskell, because the best implementations for lazy data-structures and algorithms are written in Haskell.<p>Many idioms that people use now in Scala or in other languages have been used in Haskell since years ago. Like Iteratees or type-classes.",1362511899

In addition I only see this as a tool for development, not something that I would want running in production so you don't have the concerns over increased file size or still supporting minification that you do with source maps, assuming you want source maps in production for error reporting.<p>I can envision simply using structured CSS comments to pass the needed information to the browser.  The browser only needs a structured pushing protocol, baseline comment format, probably handling of comments that indicate file boundaries (used for pushing to the correct resource) and a 'plugin api' to allow plugins to parse other comments in a meaningful way, SASS/LESS could provide a 'Dev tools' plugin to parse the comments and support whatever editing features they wanted.  They would also have to support generation of the comments in the preprocessor.<p>The important bit is a standardized pushing protocol, a standardized way to provide additional mapping information and a standardized 'plugin' style system to allow things like SASS to add to dev tools additional editing support.<p>Just one theoretical approach, still a ton of work, but I really think there is a lot of developer time spent dealing with this issue so it may well be worth it.",1362511631

5326587,comment,5325257,5326525,42,0,tikhonj,,,"Haskell is also very simple--not from an implementation standpoint but from a semantics standpoint. Having polymorphism with no sub-typing (and no casting) is conceptually simple and easy to work with. Parametric polymorphism (like Java's generics but simpler and less horrible) is actually an extremely simple concept. The difficulty comes from a) implementing it in a stupid way after the fact (<i>cough</i> Java) or b) having sub-typing. Neither is necessary!<p>In this day and age, semantics are far more important than implementation.<p>You can fit Haskell's evaluation rules and its typing rules on one page.<p>Haskell's syntax is also very simple and consistent. It has fewer constructs than most imperative languages--fewer constructs than anything short of Lisp. It just also happens to be much more flexible than other languages.<p>Moreover, much of Haskell's syntax is <i>very</i> transparent syntax sugar. You can easily desguar it in your head. It makes code nicer to read but does not add any real complexity because it trivially maps to a bunch of simple function calls.<p>Most of Haskell is a very transparent layer over a typed lambda calculus. Lambda calculus is basically one of the simplest possible constructs. Ignoring the type system for a moment, it has literally <i>three</i> concepts: functions, variables and application. We then throw in some very straight-forward extensions like numbers, add a bit of syntax sugar and a type system.<p>The type system is also surprisingly simple. It has to be, for the inference to work! It's also very consistent in the way that is almost unique to mathematics. Consistency is pretty important.<p>This is where I shall bring up the ""Simple Made Easy""[1] talk. It comes up a lot in these discussions, for a reason: most people mix the two up. I don't agree with <i>all</i> the points in the talk, but the core message is completely correct and very valuable.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a><p>Simplicity <i>is</i> valuable. And Haskell, for all its being hard to learn, <i>is</i> simple.<p>IO is a great example here. Monads are difficult to learn, granted. But they are not <i>complex</i>. Rather, they are <i>abstract</i>. In fact, monads are extremely simple; the actual difficulty is twofold: it's not immediately obvious why they matter and they're too abstract to permit any analogies. Ultimately, a monad in Haskell is just any type with three simple functions that behave consistently--it's just an interface.<p>Go is not particularly simple; rather, it's easy. It's familiar. The syntax is more arbitrary, but it is C-like. The built-in constructs like loops are more complex and arbitrary (Haskell, after all, has no built-in iteration at all), but hey, it's C-like. The exposed features? Again, fairly arbitrary.<p>That's how I would sum up Go's design: arbitrary. And mostly C-like. Where C itself is pretty arbitrary. Especially from a semantics standpoint.<p>Essentially, Go has whatever the designers felt like adding. Just look at all the different ways you can write a for-loop! Or the fact that you have a loop at all. Haskell, on the other hand, has a deep and elegant underlying theory which ensures that different parts of the language are all consistent.<p>Haskell is much less arbitrary. Most of the features naturally go together. Many are just generalizations or facets of the same concept. Even the complicated, advanced features like ""type families"" or ""GASDTs"" are just fairly natural extensions of Haskell's basic concepts. It's very much akin to mathematical ideas, which have an elegance and consistency eluding most other languages.<p>Here's a particular example of how the features fit together: algebraic data types. Haskell essentially has two fundamental ways to create data types: you can combine fields into a record (like a struct) or you can have a choice (a tagged or disjoint union). The really neat bit? These aren't arbitrary--they're actually deeply related. In fact, they're duals of each other. Having both makes the most sense.<p>It also gives you a much better way to signal errors. In Go, for whatever reason, errors are essentially built into the language as an implicit tuple. However, in practice, you <i>either</i> have a result or an error. If you have an error, the result is meaningless; if you have a result, you shouldn't have any error! So it makes <i>much</i> more sense to represent errors as a variant, a choice--a sum type. This lets Haskell avoid baking in error handling into the language, making it simpler.<p>Haskell is as mixed-paradigm as the languages you listed. Those languages are imperative with some <i>weak</i> support for functional programming. Haskell is functional with some <i>weak</i> support for imperative programming. It's the same idea, inverted. Except Haskell can also support things like non-deterministic and logic programming. It's just that, for some reason, when people say ""mixed-paradigm"" what they really mean is ""imperative with some functional support"" and never ""functional with some imperative support"".<p>Sure, Haskell's syntax for mutable structures is awkward. But have you seen C#'s or Python's or even Go's syntax for functional programming? Compared to Haskell, it's just as awkward! And Haskell's ""syntax"" for mutable constructs is just a library; it can be improved. It just turns out that imperative features aren't useful enough for experienced Haskellers to warrant the improved syntax. (Also GHC sucks at optimizing sufficiently complex imperative code, I gather.)<p>There's a nice example of what you can do on Lennart Augustss's blog[2]. He essentially embedded a very C-like language into Haskell without using macros.

I think the issue of free work/immiseration of the creative class would make a good piece. The Atlantic could acknowledge that it has succumbed to economic (and perhaps social) pressure, do some human interest pieces on people that have been effected, people that have found ways to be viable despite the economic changes, and maybe regulatory reforms that might make micro-payments feasible.<p>I could see a continuing series on this topic being well received.

Instead, people have spent countless hours trying to figure out ""the right way"" to have interdependent code that doesn't block through a synchronous XHR. Sometimes this has resulted in requiring build tools which turn imports into script tags, etc (which is frustrating for a language that shouldn't require building).<p>This is why Objective-J has @import:<p><pre><code>    @import <Foundation/CPSet.j>\n    @import <AppKit/CPView.j>\n\n    alert(CPView);\n</code></pre>\nWhat's really upsetting is that we're getting the first update to JavaScript in like 10 years, and these fundamental concerns are still not being addressed. Instead of saying ""what can give us the next generation of web apps"", we've dropped the with keyword.

Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.""</i><p>I have often stated and thought that the world to me is not black and white and that indeed no one does pure good or pure bad. But I can't say this view has ever lead me to the conclusion that therefore, no one is better than anyone else.<p>Turning this issue over in my head, I guess I always just assumed that things being on a grey scale - the operative word being ""scale"" - that this would surely mean that things existing at different points on that scale could not be considered as all being the same. Interesting to read that apparently this is not the view held by some.<p>In my personal experience, I find that those whose view is that the world is black and white tend to also be those who wish to impose this view on others. While those who see the world as grey (whether they fall into this trap of the ""Fallacy of Gray"" or not) tend to be less concerned with converting others to their viewpoint and if anything are more concerned with defending their viewpoint from attacks by the black/white people. I'm not entirely sure what conclusion to reach from this observation... Authoritarians tend to see black and white, while libertarians tend to see grey and sometimes the ""Fallacy of Gray"" possibly as a defensive overreaction?",1267073562

People who show up with laptops at 2 (1:30-2 is a common transition period), for instance, seldom stay past 5/5:30 (another common transition period). 5 or 6 hours tends to be the upper limit; most people can only sit in the same spot for so long.

Many modern languages have some sort of symbolic import statement that instructs the interpreter or compiler to add additional libraries to the execution context, but there's no single way of doing that from within JavaScript. Of course, that somewhat makes sense, as you don't want every random site making cross-domain imports and bypassing same-domain policies. At the same time, as the author demonstrates, you can have an agreed-upon API that provides much of the same functionality using XHR, which would make working with multiple libraries from different vendors a lot nicer.",1267071949

In other words, I had unintentionally made a time machine out of Mercurial.

The owners of the biz are the ones who make that decison.<p>Since we're assuming that you're being deported because you're not satisfying the conditions of the startup visa, what are the odds that said owners would have kept you on anyway?<p>Advocates of the startup visa said that they wanted to bring folks into the company to create biz.  Fair enough, but what should we conclude when they complain about deporting folks who don't do what they wanted?<p>And, what should we conclude when they make up stories about the consequences of deportation?",1267070906

If there were a large standard library built into javascript, I fear it would just be more things for different browser makers (especially Microsoft) to implement with different quirks, and you'd still need a 3rd party compatibility framework layered on top of it to be cross browser compatible, only now it would have to cover a large framework instead of just 16 objects.",1267070583

1149977,comment,1149865,1149865,0,0,csallen,,,"There was a time when I played WoW religiously, and actually had my own guild. This was back in the day, when guilds spent 30+ hours a week clearing dungeons that required 40 people to memorize and execute intricate strategies. Even though my guild was relatively successful, motivating people to show up to these raids was <i>always</i> a chore. Many players consistently left dungeons early, or avoided them altogether. Interestingly enough, these same players didn't mind spending hours grinding or fishing or hanging out in the city, doing nothing in particular. They did this despite the fact that raiding dungeons was more productive, stimulating, exciting, challenging, and potentially rewarding.<p>I suspect one of the appeals of doing repetitive, mindless things like fishing or grinding in games is because... they're repetitive and mindless. There are real-life equivalents: clicking around on Hacker News, slumping on a couch for hours watching television, etc. These activities are much less mentally exhausting, much less stressful than doing actual work.<p>Anyway, I think your idea is a great one, but there are some hurdles. If you reward people for menial activities, then they'll waste tons of time on it because it's mindless and easy. Chances are this type of work is not what any company would want its employees doing. If you only reward people for actual demanding work, then chances are you won't really be adding anything.",1267070558

But the fact that this even generates a discussion.. :-)<p>A lot of European establishments I know have decided to never join the wifi movement. And even if many cafes now offer wifi it's very hard to spot people actually sitting with their laptops. Why would you want to, there are so many other things you can do in a cafe.

Python is probably a good starting language for teenagers, but for pre-teens, who are much less cognitively mature, you'll have a lot more luck sooner if you introduce them to an IDE with great code completion and the power to make a GUI.  Obvious candidates are Visual C# and Visual Basic, but I would strongly consider Adobe Flash as well.  Children love making animations with Flash, and Flash's scripting language, ActionScript, has all of the features of a full-fledged programming language.<p>You can start even younger with HTML.  HTML isn't programming, but it's relevant training for a developing brain.  Balancing brackets, thinking logically, paying attention to detail, and the ""write, run, debug"" routine are all present when writing HTML.<p>My path to programming started when I discovered a copy of FrontPage Express (an old WYSIWYG HTML editor) installed on my computer.

First and foremost, I'm not sure what your CS education was like but if it was anything like mine it was mostly useless. The vast majority of skills/knowledge I apply to development and design now were self-taught or I have picked up working as a developer for somebody else. It's easy to ready tons of great articles about practices, methods, etc but until you get your hands dirty and code some stuff that gets real world usage you may be at a disadvantage. For example, things like enterprise-level security practices, planning for scale, having redundancy and fall-backs in place are easy to envision and 'think' you planned for but until you are actually faced with a situation where those things happen you aren't fully prepared. My advice: score the best-sounding full time job you can get and see some live internal tools, business practices, backup processes, etc. Nothing says you can't code your dream product in your free time while still getting exposure to a real, working product/business (and making money to throw at your startup as well!)",1288716337

1861146,comment,1860444,1860864,0,0,gjm11,,,"Yes, you could put a resistive and a capacitive touchscreen one on top of the other. (It would have to be capacitive on the top, resistive underneath.) But although that would give you the best of both worlds in terms of capabilities, it would be the worst of both worlds in other respects.<p>Either sort of touchscreen has two layers of a transparent conductor. A resistive touchscreen has two ""solid"" layers on separate pieces of glass or plastic, with spacers between the two so they don't come into contact unless pushed. Pushing down on it with a stylus brings the two layers into contact. How does this suck? Let me count the ways. 1. Lots of layers. ITO isn't perfectly transparent, and glass/air interfaces are always going to reflect a bit even with anti-reflective coatings. So you lose transparency (by different amounts at different wavelengths too, so either you get a wrong colour balance or you lose more brightness to fix that up) and get more reflections. 2. Poor robustness. Your front sheet of glass or plastic has to be thin enough to flex, and you're flexing it all the time. That's not great. The ITO layer on the front sheet is also flexing, and that's even worse because you want it to be thin (for optical performance) but the thinner it is the more readily it cracks. 3. Thickness. Multiple layers of glass or plastic, physical spacers in between, ugh.<p>Adding a capacitive sensor to this will make the optical quality even worse because you'll need more ITO layers. What's more, the capacitive sensor will have to be on the top (I think trying to do capacitive sensing <i>through</i> the conductive layers of a resistive sensor is a non-starter), which means those ITO layers are also flexing when you push on them, for extra-bad robustness. And you'll probably need to space them away from the resistive sensor underneath a bit, making the sensor assembly even thicker, though perhaps there are ways around that.<p>Perhaps you could combine one layer of the capacitive sensor with one layer of the resistive one, but that seems tricky. A typical capacitive touchscreen uses two layers of <i>patterned</i> conductors, with lots of gaps in (so much so that although there are two layers, over most of the display only one is present, at least in the designs I know about -- it's been a few years since I was in the business, so technology may have moved on). A typical resistive touchscreen uses two <i>solid</i> layers, and putting gaps in them will make it completely fail to work. I wouldn't want to rule out the possibility of combining them, but it would be tricky.<p>Well. Actually, there's another design of capacitive touchscreen which uses a single solid conducting layer a bit like one layer of a resistive sensor. It's much harder to get good accuracy that way, but I've seen sensors of that design of tablet size and larger. You might well be able to combine that with a resistive design, but I bet the accuracy would be poor.<p>(And, incidentally, using a resistive sensor with a stylus ""for fine input"" doesn't seem like such a great idea to me, for the same reason: it's difficult to get really good accuracy from a resistive sensor.)<p>There's another simpler approach: use just a capacitive sensor, and a conductive stylus. That has some accuracy problems of its own, especially if the sensor wasn't designed with stylus use in mind, and it won't enable you to use the device while wearing gloves or a wetsuit or whatever, but it seems likely to be a much better compromise than stacking one sensor on top of another.",1288715734

Which is to say, there are a fair number of things that are startups and can be done with a couple coders and some ramen over a couple months -- often not evening needing a ""marketing"" guru -- while there are lots of other problems which require more specialized domain knowledge (either with respect to technology, market, or both).<p>In this case, what you need to succeed depends largely on having the right set of skills to succeed within your specific domain, assuming you have one. I'm generally of the opinion that there is much lower risk in these areas (assuming you know your market well) since presumably all you have to do is match an existing need with a product, the primary barrier being your competence.<p>How do you acquire the skills necessary? This too depends on which side of the ball you are on. Larger startups need people in different roles. Rather than getting in on a little startup and being part-time coder, part-time cleaner, part-time ramen cook, get out in the would and be the most excellent in whatever facet you excel in. Heck, you may decide that making the world a better place in whatever capacity you are best at (usually also what you enjoy) you is better than attempting getting superrich and retiring at 30.<p>In other words, my advice to all ""startup"" people out there is do what makes you tick, do it as best as you can, and let your startup, <i>if</i> it arises meet a need that you know is real. This may be a problem that people don't realize is a problem (like limited and often unintuitive course management software) or it may be something bigger and better that only a few people will understand (e.g. a cure for Multiple Sclerosis).<p>Anyways, I've nothing against serial entrepreneurs if that's what makes you tick.

I make games for a living and more times than not, jerkiness/glitches are an indication of bad programming than the platform it was written in. Pong is an ultra-simple game but you'd be surprised even on a game as basic as that the issues that can crop up that require elegant coding. Collision in particular -- the simplest, most obvious way in pong to check when the ball collides is to check the intersection of a point and a line, or a point and polygon/rectangle, the point being the edge of the ball (top/bottom of it for the walls, left/right of it for the paddles) versus the edge of the paddle or the whole paddle.  More precise, but more math used and thus a less common way of writing the game, is to check the intersection of a circle and a line segment/polygon.<p>For example in flash, there are some built-in methods that everyone tends to use but don't get ""pixel perfect collision"" -- if you google that phrase you can see where people have tried to come up with perfect collision and how complicated all the math is for it.<p>I know for a fact just from playing this flash/html5 pong that it wasn't coded perfectly because it glitches when the ball gets to too high of a speed, either getting stuck in the wall and bouncing along it but not away from it, or going right through the paddle.<p>So this is really apples and oranges, unless both halves were coded with the exact same algorithms for everything (and just different syntax for the languages) -- very unlikely -- and, as evidenced by the other commenters also completely dependent on the environment/browser implementations of html5 and the flash plugins.<p>However, way cool on the link-bait worthiness :)  I shoulda thought of this =P",1288714742

This can be done by sabotaging voting machines, resulting in long wait times that will discourage people from voting (as mentioned by another comment); or intentionally underestimating voter turnout and delivering too few machines in the first place; or by spreading rumors that it's a landslide and they don't need to vote; or spreading misinformation on how to fill out the ballot, resulting in failed votes; or intentionally putting polling places in the bad part of town to scare away voters; or putting polling places far away from public transit and/or sufficient parking space; or any number of underhanded tactics designed to prevent people from. None of it is ever really proven or investigated, but you tend to get a lot of highly significant p-values on election day, indicating that most of these events are probably intentional, and not accidental.<p>And don't forget Gerrymandering, in which the party in power redraws the voting district lines to ensure that every district has a majority of their party (though that happens <i>before</i> election day): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering</a><p>Edit: I added a few more examples from other replies that represent common methods of intentional sabotage.",1288714406

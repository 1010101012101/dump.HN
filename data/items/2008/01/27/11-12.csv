It reminds me of the recent incident were some gangsters were busted because they posted revealing videos on YouTube. Moreover, I wonder if some crawler could be devised looking for people admitting their scams on their blogs, and solve a huge amounts of crimes that way...",1201435060

104940,comment,104848,104923,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"yep it would be fairly simple to do. The problem with this method is IE6 does not support it and if you are doing client work they are not going to like the fact that it does not work on IE6.",1201434269

104937,comment,104582,104656,0,0,jward,,,"Speaking as someone who cooks a lot for himself and is very interested in nutrition and proper diet, I have no idea why you're even asking this.  Nutrition wise, vegans who play it smart are just as if not more healthy than the rest of us.  Finance wise it's often cheaper because lets face it, meat is expensive.  Time wise it's no different than any other type of meal preparation, which I believe studies have shown is actually faster than waiting for delivery or going out and ordering at a restraunt.<p>The fact is that it shows a level of dedication above and beyond what normal people exert.  I'd say that puts them well in the running for a startup.",1201433501
104936,comment,104807,104875,0,0,Tichy,,,"Well it seemed like a good opportunity to try out Greasemonkey at the time (wrote it for the last application cycle). Just thought the one or other applicant might appreciate it. The bookmarklet somebody else posted might be more elegant, though.<p>Also I had been looking for word count scripts like that and didn't find any, so maybe it can be useful for other web sites, too (it works for the news.yc comment form, for example).",1201433425

104934,comment,104802,104802,0,0,DocSavage,,,"My dissertation involved segmenting and rendering brains from 3D MR images of the head.  One of the ways I checked my software was by hacking the head off a cadaver, imaging it, hacking out the brain, and then successfully matching volumes and photographs of the brain sulci from various POVs with the 3D renderings generated from the segmented images.  That's probably my most successful hacking of a non-computer system :)",1201432852

Also, I just remember MC Hammer being in a promo video of a YC startup, I think weebly. And I've heard he is starting his own social network thing, something music related.",1201432626

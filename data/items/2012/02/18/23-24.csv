Selling ads is pocket money, at the end of the day the wealth is in the mega database of the user data. \nSee, paying users can choose to take their dollars elsewhere so you have to give them what they want, if it's gratis people flock on the service and lack the incentive to go away if the service is somewhat unsatisfying so you can impose whatever you want to them.<p>2) they can't offer such an option, facebook is a machine designed to collect, store, hold and aggregate user data and they built a business model out of it. Putting the user in control of its data is the opposite of what facebook wants.\nYou can't really compare the subscription of news aggregator websites and an hypothetical subscription on facebook. Facebook is unique in the fact that it holds user personal data and has a strong grasp on it through heavy vendor lock-in, you can easily leave slashdot or reddit and get your news elsewhere from an alternative but you can't leave facebook easily because they have your data, data you need in your daily use and there's nowhere to go to to find an equivalent.",1329609324
3608119,comment,3607741,3607741,1,0,darklighter3,,,"One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of people who leave school 'for a little while' with full intentions of going back can find it difficult to do so and then never go back. When you're in the 'real' world you can start to accumulate commitments and the more of these you have the less compatible college is with your life.<p>From other comments it sounds like your main motivation is to make yourself more marketable to future employers. CS grads are already highly marketable especially when combined with internships and/or part-time work. It sounds like you already have good experience and presumably you will have more during college with an internship or some such thing. If you complete a degree you'll have the qualifications that hiring managers would look for. Having full-time experience instead of part-time isn't going to give you any added benefit. And it probably won't get you a higher starting salary - you'll be in the same hiring pool with all of the other new grads.<p>And there are costs to be considered. You'll be delaying your college experience by a year. Your friends will be meeting smart interesting people and going to parties and spending late nights in the lab working on cool projects and learning about things they hadn't even heard of before. You'll have to get up early for work tomorrow. You'll be delaying the start of your career by a year. Your salary can rise pretty quickly in your first five years after school. How fast it goes up will be determined on how you perform on your first job(s) not on some work you did when you were 18. The money you earn next year probably won't make up for delaying that process by a year. Also note that salaries can vary widely by geography and are much higher in the Bay Area, New York, etc. If you want to move to a higher earning location you'll be delaying that by a year.",1329609313

3608113,comment,3607248,3608091,3,0,_delirium,,,"I can buy that in terms of definitions. My objection is more based on the common use-case of ""parsing"" Lisp in this fashion to do some kind of source-to-source transformation, like the example in this post, which I've also wanted to do. The post saves itself by only replacing the first symbol in a form. But what if you wanted to do something fairly simple like replace every call to <i>foo</i> with some other bit of code?<p>In idiomatic Lisp code, you either miss lots of the calls, or you have to complicate your code-walker significantly. This is especially the case if you write CL in the (common, but not universal) style that makes significant use of the <i>loop</i> macro, because you either ignore it as a macro, and consider anything inside it opaque until macro-resolution time (because you don't know what it does to its arguments), or you special-case it as a new bit of CL syntax, in which case your parsing is now fancier. Usually you want something like the latter, because source-to-source transformations expect to also replace things inside loops. Same with, say, special-casing <i>setf</i> forms, if you want source-to-source transformations to ""do what I mean"" in a large number of cases.<p>It's true that it's very easy to literally get the list representing the code, but there's precious little sensible you can <i>do</i> with that list unless you're willing to descend into some of the more commonly used built-in macros that most CLers treat as de-facto syntax, which requires knowing something about the syntax they in effect define.",1329609148

If the project becomes a net benefit then the dissenters get the benefit and win even though their judgement was incorrect.<p>Lots of people dissented from the iPhone. Now they benefit. Their benefitting doesn't hurt Apple or prevent Apple from having funded the project themselves and from making plenty of profit. Apple got what they paid for and then some. Other people come out ahead too but that isn't Apple's loss. I don't think some people getting unearned benefit is something to worry about as long as the primary actors are able to make their profit.<p>The same point could be made more broadly about computers as a whole. Funded by a minority initially, now hugely benefitting many people who didn't take any of the initial risk.<p>I think there is an asymmetry. I'm far more concerned about people being forced to pay for failed projects or projects requiring capital they more urgently need elsewhere -- being actively, involuntarily hurt -- than I am worried about people gaining broad benefits from projects that benefit the primary actors and risk takers plenty (I actually regard this free stuff to lots of people, which is the result of many projects, as a positive, happy thing, not a negative.)<p>If you'd like to discuss further, with interesting people and no downvotes, you could come to:<p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/rational-politics-list?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/rational-politics-list?hl=en</a>",1329608136

In order to share essentially any code we're supposed to pre-clear it with our internal ""open source council"" by filing a jira ticket and asking permission.  Each time, every time.  They meet monthly, so you potentially wait up to 30 days.  Of course the company realizes they only own our work that is directly related to our employment or that is done with company property.  On the other hand, they have two in house attorneys, one of whom was a partner at a very high end law firm.  So in practical terms, in any legal pissing match I'd lose, no matter the merits of the case, since I can't afford my own $600/hour IP attorney.<p>Which is a long way of explaining that many people have very high barriers to sharing code.

The other option that C++ popularized the use of is <> but that's syntactically sketchy since both < and > are valid by themselves. It makes parsing a complete nightmare both for machines and, to a lesser extent, people. I wouldn't be completely averse to indentation-based blocking, but I'm not really a huge fan of it either.

It's about learning the math and science behind computation theory.  You don't learn things like Visual Studio 2010 or how to set up an EC2 instance or how to build iPhone apps.  You learn how to build a compiler, the data structures behind file- and operating-systems, and networking fundamentals (among many other things of course) so that you can then learn specific technologies on your own.<p>If you know why TCP was invented and the core networking stack, and you know what a compiler is and how it does its magic, and when to use a linked list instead of a dictionary, then you have the tools to figure out how to build an iPhone app--or how to use any other computer technology--on your own time.<p>Edit: I also want to add that CS does change, and learning networking or something like RDBMS theory might not have been common 10 or 20 years ago.  But there's few fields worth learning that don't change in that sort of timespan.  Core CS principles do change, but probably not much slower or faster than things like physics or medicine.

They also don't tell you that it's technically legal and cheap to get the same highway squad to build a new road to the same place, and that it only takes a day or so of waiting time -- though you cannot be sure that the same highway squad won't close it down again, and so you pay some extra to some out-of-towner with a private lot between you and the highway, to build their own exit to your place.<p>Nuances like that are pretty specific to the cases that we're dealing with here.<p>Also there is the problem that it's totally a mistake and is silently reversed some days later -- yet nobody compensates you for the lost business or even apologizes for the horrible stain on your reputation. People instead blame you for choosing to open the mall on the west side of the town, which is more popular for businesses but the highway department on that side is well-known for handling these sorts of requests in a generally poor fashion, caving in under a minimum of pressure and not keeping you in the loop, and so forth.",1329606623

I feel very lonely as a consultant trying to show a whole project how to be pragmatic and not only care about making better hashtables, but to actually care about the customer and the product as a whole. The funny thing is that some companies (generally younger and smaller ones) can be so very professional, while bigger ones house teams which are really stagnant and have a completely unrealistic view on software development. I suppose it's logical considering the ""do or die"" situation that most startups are in, but its sad to see these money black- holes thrive within large organisations.",1329606617

Zamyatin, Orwell, Chomsky, Hager, Binney, Drake, Assange, Snowden ... they&#x27;ve been on about this for a century. Ten years ago it was conspiracy theory, now it&#x27;s mainstream social reality. Still, most people don&#x27;t care to listen... secure in their televised Colosseum serial economic treadmill stupour... knocking back throwaway media to numb themselves to the truth, competing to buy fallacious fashion facepalm devices that actively discourage intellectual authorship, context, privacy or even direct unmediated expression... but perhaps the tide is finally changing?<p>On the flip-side, this one&#x27;s nicely timed, given the preface and thrust of Cypherpunks[0], for the same day as the review of Assange&#x27;s case in Sweden... which according to Assange&#x27;s recent interview[1] should get thrown out after tomorrow&#x27;s appeal[2]. I wonder if the UN gets it now? Of course, it&#x27;s semi-irrelevant anyway since the US will cockblock[3] them on actually actioning anything remotely related to real, functional, positive change, but it&#x27;s a nice gesture on the human rights commissioner&#x27;s part for national-level change-makers to point the finger at.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/cypherpunks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/cypherpunks/</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.democracynow.org/2014/7/7/exclusive_inside_embassy_refuge_julian_assange"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.democracynow.org/2014/7/7/exclusive_inside_embass...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.thisdayinwikileaks.org/2014/07/15-july-2014.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisdayinwikileaks.org/2014/07/15-july-2014.html</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council...</a>",1405507979
8041435,comment,8040109,8040600,4,0,alextgordon,,,"IMO the problem is not private-by-default but small modules and the confusion of scope with packages. (I should say that my Rust experience is non-existent so correct me if my intuition on its semantics is wrong).<p>It&#x27;s reasonable that individual Rust files have their own scope. But it is a nonsense to imbue a <i>namespace</i> with an API or versioning story. Programmers do not think that way.<p>What has an API? A package. Something big enough that you can submit it to a package manager.<p>Therefore, private symbols in a package should be public <i>to</i> that package. That doesn&#x27;t mean they should be <i>in scope</i>, but they should be available to be imported by other files in the package.<p>Public/private would then only be relevant at the boundary between packages.<p>There&#x27;s a good reason to do this: it encourages modular design. A small-module language like Python uses modules <i>so</i> much that they miss the opportunity to take on a life of its own.<p>For instance, Django is split into hundreds of tiny &quot;modules&quot;. But no one of them is big enough to be meaningful without the others. There is no singular &quot;Django templates&quot; module, nor a &quot;Django ORM&quot; module. In that sense it is monolithic via over-modularization.",1405507933

We almost didn&#x27;t have to change the code when ported from RequireJS.<p>* Browserify&#x27;s &quot;all in one bundle&quot; approach is precisely what we wanted to get away from, because our codebase grew like crazy. Webpack supports [code splitting][1] which allowed us to cut initial JS by half.<p>* As Pete Hunt said on some thread I can&#x27;t find now, Browserify doesn&#x27;t bring anything really new to the table. Webpack, on the other hand, brings &quot;loaders&quot; (first-class support for applying cacheable transformations as a build step for module). While they are not documented very well[2], they allow insane extensibility. They can be used for anything, from declarative code splitting with require() returning a promise[3], to compiling LESS[4], to bundling CSS as a JS dependency[5], to running JSHint[6].<p>* Hot Module Replacement gives each module an API to declare how it reacts to its dependencies being updated[7]. Loaders can use this API too, e.g. `style-loader` uses HMR to replace stylesheet without reloading the page[8], so you don&#x27;t need to write extra code.<p>The biggest downside right now is the documentation being too technical. In the long run though, I believe Webpack will get more popular once its docs are improved, because it&#x27;s just crazy powerful and extensible.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/code-splitting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/code-splitting</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/360"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/360</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/gaearon/promise-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gaearon/promise-loader</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/webpack/less-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpack/less-loader</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://www.npmjs.org/package/style-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.org/package/style-loader</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://github.com/webpack/jshint-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpack/jshint-loader</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-we...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement</a>",1405507305

Frequently, the bid-offer spread would be many ticks wide, so you could easily be paying $0.25 or $0.50 for each round trip.<p>The current minimum tick size is $0.01, and there are many stocks which trade at that level. Even if you suffer $0.05 of slippage on a round trip, you&#x27;re still better off than you would have been under the old regime.<p>In the old regime, instead of high frequency traders, you had floor brokers who would work orders. Fortunately, floor brokers were paragons of virtue and morality, who would certainly never front run their clients orders, and would take any trade even if it worked to their disadvantage (NB in case you don&#x27;t get it - this is sarcasm. In the 1987 crash, most brokers wouldn&#x27;t even pick up their fucking phone because too many people were trying to sell stock, and the brokers didn&#x27;t want to buy).<p>I honestly find it hard to believe that some people think that was better than what we have today.<p>---<p><i>Edit</i>: The other thing I don&#x27;t get is why ordinary investors (by which I mean anyone with less than $100m to invest) care about this. For a small investor, you are actually getting an even better deal because your order for 1000 shares or whatever can get filled instantaneously, in one chunk, for a great price! It&#x27;s only when you&#x27;re trying to buy hundreds of thousands of shares in a few minutes that you end up suffering price slippage.<p>The standard response is that ordinary investors have their money invested in mutual funds and pensions, who are large investors. But in that case you are already paying 0.5-2% per year to your fund manager, and why do you give a shit if they lose 10 basis points (0.1%) in price slippage because the market is more efficient than it used to be?<p>In fact, why is my pension fund manager trading so fucking much anyway? I don&#x27;t have a pension because I think the fund manager is some genius stock picker, I have it because it&#x27;s tax efficient and my employer contributes to it. Just buy the S&P500 and sit on it.",1405506920

8041342,comment,8040943,8040943,16,0,throwaway283719,,,"What is happening here is really quite simple, and doesn&#x27;t deserve an entire blog post.<p>There are two exchanges, A and B, and a market maker Jill is quoting (say) 10,000 shares on each of those two exchanges for $17.<p>Big institutional trader Jack sees the 20,000 shares and decides that he wants to buy 15,000 of them, so he sends two orders for 7,500 shares each to A and B. Because of various effects (network latencies, routing switching delays, whatever) his order arrives at exchange A first, and is immediately filled at $17.<p>Jill, who has her computer co-located at exchange A, sees that she has sold 7,500 shares for $17, and realizes that there is demand for shares. Because of this demand, she decides to raise her prices. She immediately cancels her remaining 2500 shares on exchange A and replaces them with 10,000 shares at $17.05 and sends an instruction to do the same thing at exchange B.<p>Because Jill has fast computers and low-latency connections, her cancellation arrives at exchange B before Jack&#x27;s buy order, so Jack is told that there are no longer shares available on exchange B at $17.<p>RESULT: Jack is filled for 7500 shares at $17 (half of what he requested) and the new market best offer is $17.05. Jack is welcome to submit another order for $17.05 if he wants to buy at that price. Jill is now short 7500 shares at $17, and will try to buy them back at a lower price (she may or may not succeed - until she does, she is exposed to the risk of further price rises).<p>Jill was able to use her speed advantage to detect that there was additional demand to buy this stock, and raise the price at which she was willing to sell it before Jack had finished buying all that he wanted to. This is <i>exactly</i> the way that an efficient market is supposed to work - it reacts to fluctuating demand (and other information) to set appropriate prices.<p>I think there are several things that get glossed over while people are working themselves up about this -<p>1. Jack is upset because he couldn&#x27;t buy 15,000 shares at the price he wanted to buy them. But Jack has no god-given right to be able to buy shares at the price he likes best. He is subject to the laws of the market, just like everyone else.<p>2. The <i>only</i> reason that Jill has a speed advantage over Jack is because she has paid for it! She has paid to co-locate her server at the exchange, and she has paid to use high-speed connections between exchanges. Are we going to declare that paying for a competitive advantage is suddenly immoral?<p>3. If Jack doesn&#x27;t like this state of affairs, he has several options. He can invest in high-speed infrastructure as well. He can use smarter order-routing logic (e.g. adding delays to his orders so that they arrive at the exchanges approximately simultaneously, or splitting his large order up into multiple smaller orders). Or he can use a broker who will do these things for him. If Jack doesn&#x27;t want to pay for any of these things, then he has to put up with lower quality execution. As much as he might wish it, the ability to buy as many shares as he wants at the price he wants them is not a universal human right.",1405505505

But I have spent a lot of time trying to remove unnecessary allocations/deallocations/copies from performance-critical, string-heavy C++ code. I use a combination of custom allocators and slice-like objects, but both of these approaches make it a hassle to interact with code using the natural std::string.<p>A pervasive distinction between strings that manage their own memory and those that don&#x27;t, along with language and library support to make using them in combination straightforward would be a big win for me.",1405504949

8041325,comment,8040943,8040943,3,0,erpellan,,,"A solution: Discrete double auctions. Instead of continuous trading, the exchange can divide up the day into a series of small windows (say 100ms). When you come to trade in the market, you have to wait for the next window to open. You submit your order and you find out what happened at the end of the window. This way nobody has any timing advantage and the delay is barely noticeable to &#x27;normal&#x27; traders (waiting 1/5 of a second is hardly an inconvenience). It also stops all the order-book shenanigans that HFT players get up to (where they stuff the book with orders and cancel/resubmit them at high frequency).<p>So why don&#x27;t exchanges do this? They make a ton of money in fees, it simply isn&#x27;t in their interest to prevent HFT at the moment. Change their incentives (ie. regulate differently) and they might actually do something about it.",1405504872

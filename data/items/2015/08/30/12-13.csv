It is like a greek iota (ι) with a dot on top. Also it is a bit tall font. Whilst that makes text/code more readable, on the same time it let you see less lines on your terminal.

From what I remember, many physicists are not entirely satisfied with the Standard Model and have been &quot;looking to replace it&quot; for quite some time, the main problem being that it was still the best at describing reality (or experiments results, which is about the same for physics).<p>Could somebody who is into the field answer how relevant this is, and/or perhaps point to a better source?

10143163,comment,10139094,10139890,0,0,tim333,,,"I kind of lived through this effect with the decline of the British coal industry which was nationalised at the time. It became uncompetitive mostly because British coal was hard to get at compared to say open pit mining in Australia, so money was lost on each ton dug up. But the argument against closing it was the miners needed jobs, it was hard for them to switch to other work, sacking them would kill the economy in mining towns and so on. It was easier for the government to pay the losses from taxes on the general population who didn&#x27;t complain very much, than to fire a bunch of miners who would complain very loudly. And who did of course when Thatcher eventually fired them.<p>With hindsight it would have been better for the industry to decline gradually than laying off everyone at once.",1440939019

US electric ovens, dryers, water heaters, conventional split AC, etc run on 240V. It&#x27;s fairly trivial to install a 6.6kW &quot;charger&quot; in most US residences. (It&#x27;s not in a detached garage if fed by only a single 120VAC line.)<p>US industrial is variously 208VAC, 240VAC, 277VAC, and 480VAC; some are single phase; some are three phase.<p>If you&#x27;re discussing only the &quot;walk up and plug into an existing outlet&quot; situation, EU charging will be faster. Not so for permanently installed chargers.<p>As for the very last point, the supply equipment negotiates with the car to advertise how much supply it has. Unless you can tell it to charge at 24A, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; and the charge will be at the slower rate. Same in the US. If I plug my trickle charger into a typical 15A plug, it charges at around 12A. If I plug the equipment into a 20A plug, it still charges at the same rate, because the equipment doesn&#x27;t know that a higher amperage is available.",1440938608

One of the hallmarks of ADD is hyperfocus, so ADD is a misnomer; it could easily be called, &quot;doesn&#x27;t pay attention when the teacher wants syndrome,&quot; or &quot;is not interested in your boring trivia syndrome&quot;. There are a ton of people previously diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s who lead happy, productive lives. Both of these characteristics can be positive in the world of tech entrepreneurship, and could well have been positive in previous environments. [1]<p>That said, I think this guy making his central message, &quot;Addiction is not a disease,&quot; is dangerous to the point of idiocy. In our current society, we really only have one mechanism for aiding those who will need a lot of help, and that&#x27;s saying that they&#x27;re sick. If he would like to make a full-scale assault on the disease model, godspeed. But a lot of people already want to believe that addicts could quit any time if they just applied a little willpower. Reinforcing that means that people who could be saved will die unnecessarily.<p>[1] See, e.g., the hunter vs farmer hypothesis for ADD: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis</a>",1440938370

I tried to use &quot;rational&quot; in the context of the original article, which perhaps I failed to do so. The interviewer notes the contemporary critique of Enlightenment rationality, which Saul seems to share. So when I critique this kind of rationality, I mean a type of faculty that is in a different category from emotions and faith, that is separated from Saul&#x27;s description of the other faculties of humanity.<p>I think Eli and I are caught in what Wittgenstein might call a &quot;language game.&quot; We seem to be using the same word but we&#x27;re really meaning two different things. It&#x27;d be like if I thought basketball was a game involving kicking a ball into a net (soccer) and Eli thought it was a game involving throwing a ball into a net (basketball). While in that case we do have one objective definition of basketball, we don&#x27;t necessarily have one universally accepted definition for &quot;rationality.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m kind of reaching my limit here in terms of knowledge of philosophy; I&#x27;ve perhaps confused things by framing my descriptions using two contradictory definitions of rationality: that of the Enlightenment idea of rational (which I critique) vs St. Maximos the Confessor&#x27;s idea of rational (which I advocate). I think that Eli is arguing from a Kantian sense, in terms of actions being rational up to a subjective idea of an ultimate good. Luckily for us, I&#x27;ve found a paper that discusses these three topics and will hopefully clear up the miscommunication we&#x27;ve had: <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/10973797/A_Byzantine_Critique_of_Enlightenment-Modernity_s_and_Postmodernity_s_Rationality_Case_Studies_in_Maximos_the_Confessor_s_Pistemology_and_Axiology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/10973797/A_Byzantine_Critique_of_Enl...</a><p>Edit: I initially said that Eli and I are perhaps in agreement, but assuming he&#x27;s arguing from the Kantian sense then we aren&#x27;t.",1440936835

The way he downplays Reduce, Macsyma (Maxima), the pioneering work that was Veltman&#x27;s Schoonschip and then FORM... He doesn&#x27;t even mention the folks at Maple. Computer Algebra was a well established field way before Mathematica appeared in 1988[1]. He&#x27;s smart and very good at selling his product, that&#x27;s fine, and for a long time his company has had the resources to hire a lot of good people and you can tell/take advantage of it when using Mathematica. But honestly, I think we could do without.<p>Personally, I find more interesting David R. Stoutmeyer, who made the first CAS for microcomputers in the late 70s, muMath for CP/M, and then the tiny PICOMATH-80 for the TRS-80. He went on to write Derive, that was much loved in the early 90s, because it was very good and you could afford it while Mathematica has always been expensive and for some years (until version 2.2 really) you needed either a souped- up Macintosh or a workstation to run it. Then Texas Instruments hired him in order to develop the Derive-based TI-92/89 (Derive was written in Lisp, its version for those in C BTW) and ended up buying Soft Warehouse and shutting Derive for good... which is just sad and nobody cares.<p>I&#x27;d like to ask for some love for Reduce, now open sourced and hosted at SourceForge -not cool any more, but it lives there-. It still makes a few calculations easier than Mathematica.<p>[1] See for instance this very interesting review of the early Mathematica: <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/mma.review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/mma.review.pdf</a>",1440936431

They saw for themselves what had to change.” The Maidenhead team developed a seven-step process that began before the changeover, mirroring McLaren’s cycle of simulation, pre-planning, debriefing and continuous improvement. Changeover times fell by 60 percent, dropping from an average of 39 minutes to 15, equating to an extra 20 million tubes by the end of the year. “We used to see changeovers as down time,” Glover says. “McLaren sees pit stops as an opportunity to win the race.”</i><p>It seems like it boils down to this.

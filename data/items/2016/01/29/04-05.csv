There are 14 known serotonin receptor subtypes (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT_receptor#Subtypes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT_receptor#Subtypes</a>). Psychedelic drugs (mushrooms, LSD, etc) typically act on 5-HT2a receptors. Serotonin is involved in perceptual filtering, hence why fractal patterns and hallucinations can occur when 5-HT2a is triggered.<p>I would actually say that there&#x27;s a more obvious link between dopamine and mood than serotonin. Dopamine releasers (amphetamines, meth, ritalin, cocaine) produce an immediate uplifting and confidence-boosting effect. MDMA doesn&#x27;t just release serotonin, it also releases dopamine. The serotonin release from MDMA is responsible for its powerful anti-anxiety effect. It&#x27;s believed that the &quot;loved up&quot; feeling from that drug is due to an indirect action of serotonin which eventually produce oxytocin release.",1454043316

What stood out for me in the paper was that out of box performance of VGG (trained on imagenet alone) was as good as fine tuned alexnet.<p>I am interested in assessing if there are any tricks that could be used when querying from a mobile device. In such cases feature extraction can be performed on the device itself, with only feature vectors sent over the network. In case of pinterest, another special case is that a lot queries are performed on images already present in the system. The user simply readjusts the bounding box to highlight the object of interest. In this case they can simply pre-compute 4~20 crops per image. Online feature computation is much more expensive / complicated than offline.",1454042746

It was so hot that they had to hang 12 inches of cooling fans so that processor wouldn’t overheat. It would have been insane to continue this project.”<p>to me at least, it seems that optimistic-reads with in-place pessimistic writes and automatic retries a.k.a weakly-atomic-update-in-place (raison d&#x27;être for tm) is the biggest torpedo in tm&#x27;s direction.<p>for example, assume we have :<p>---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x<p><pre><code>   bool owning_obj = false;\n   some_obj x = new some_obj();\n\n   /* txn-0 */\n   atomic {\n       owning_obj = true;\n   }\n\n   int z = x.some_value;\n</code></pre>\n---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x<p><pre><code>   /* txn-1 */\n   atomic {\n       if (!owning_obj)\n           x.some_value = 12314;\n   }\n</code></pre>\n---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x<p>ok, so now we have a problem :), specifically : although txn-1 would rollback, because the value of owning_obj is changed, but it is too late. the other thread using x (txn-0) will see a constantly changing state. who knows what will happen next.<p>it might be possible to have some kind of RCU semantics here, where you wait for a quiescent state to be reached, but that would be pretty complicated.<p>may you please provide your comments ? it is all very educational :)",1454042616

Of course you don&#x27;t have the money, nor the ability to borrow the money, that you&#x27;d need to actually satisfy a &quot;real&quot; FDIC incident (one component of &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks).<p>The banks realize that you&#x27;ve done this, so what do they do ? They borrow massive amounts of money to one another. Why does this help ? Well it guarantees that anyone who&#x27;s done this borrowing of large amounts of money can&#x27;t be thrown under the bus. Why not ? Because if one of them goes down, it will take down others (by not repaying the loan). So the government is forced to save even the ones where the FDIC reserves might actually suffice. Also, you pay out this loan to your shareholders and management (to yourself, essentially).<p>1.5% ... 1% ... 0.5%<p>The banks are losing money, because they can&#x27;t convince investors their loans are probably backed. But you&#x27;re a government ... you simply legislate that these companies that loan you lots of money exist, and you save them. And then they take more risk, and more risk, and fuck up, and get bailed out, and take yet more risk, maybe get bailed out a bit more. Your interest rate devaluations let you borrow more, but you have to use it to save the &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks/companies.<p>Note that the government is not innocent in the risk taking : because the government is effectively taxing loans (by making sure they can&#x27;t get a proper risk premium, and have to loan to the government -> other parts of the bank need to make enough profit to make up).<p>And of course you&#x27;re still borrowing money for the reasons you started to borrow money.<p>0.5 ... 0.25 ... 0 ... -0.05 ... -0.3%<p>Now you&#x27;re having the problem that these banks are bleeding money - fast.

Outlawing cash, gold, a lot of types of stock, and directly taxing all bank deposits is the obvious answer. And the only other option is to lower global government expenses by ~12%. Essentially a wealth tax.<p>There is of course another option: if they don&#x27;t make a choice there is one other solution : having 10%+ inflation in Europe and America. All mortgages at 15% for a year or two and just deal with the miser that&#x27;ll cause.

So the compromise of one server does not compromise certificates on any other servers and the useful lifetime of a compromised key is very limited.<p>I think DNSSEC and DANE is the best solution.

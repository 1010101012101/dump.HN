It&#x27;s very difficult to predict the future demand for a resource beyond a timescale of decades.<p>A good historical parallel for this kind of situation might be aluminum, which was a precious metal for many years. When it suddenly became available in large quantities due to new chemical processes for extracting it, supply skyrocketed and led to whole new industries.

That alone seems to get me into anything I want even if I was bullshitting (which i&#x27;m not). So people who are far better than me at what they do as software engineer should have no problems at all. However most of who I meet and interview are timid and not very confident. Programmers in general really undersell themselves; even if they did great stuff, they will wind it down to things like &#x27;I built some software which gets input from workout machines&#x27; vs &#x27;I wrote an embedded OS and optimized (32kb it has to process the data!) analytics software which runs on most of the machines in YOUR favorite gym&#x27;. Or &#x27;I did a C++ fast cgi e-commerce backend for an auction site&#x27; vs &#x27;I wrote the backend for an auction site doing 400 million euros of transactions a year with millions of pageviews per month&#x27;. When you get above the &#x27;junior programmer&#x27; people want to hear what you can &#x27;get done&#x27; not some tech details of something which sounds like you just came from uni. I think a lot of people underestimate how much people will rely on them once they are seniors and if they don&#x27;t have that air, why would anyone hire?<p>All programmers above 40 (and 50) who are not afraid to sell themselves are employed (and/or wealthy); the timid ones sometimes are but mostly are not; they complain that no-one wants to hire them.

Let&#x27;s be charitable to the student and assume that it was not pornographic. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that the student was hoping that the teacher would inadvertently show this image on an overhead projector to the whole class. If setting up a male teacher to show an image of homosexuals was not intended to negatively affect his reputation then what was the intent?<p>If you&#x27;re a high school teacher you&#x27;re going to have to have a ticker skin than that to let such stuff bother you. You&#x27;re dealing with 30-odd students with hormones raging and all kinds of issues they need to deal with, your &#x27;reputation&#x27; is not going to be damaged one way or another by you putting up a picture on an overhead projector placed there by another person.

From 6-11 I was at a boarding school in the country, and we had classes of 12 or so at the most.<p>The three science and geography teachers (overlap, in the most excellent fashion) were autodidacts who believed everybody else could be too - and proved it in shovels. I recall the phrase &quot;now why do YOU think ...?&quot; being almost percussion in lessons - almost everything was &quot;you figure it out and then let&#x27;s bash heads and figure out what&#x27;s right&quot;.<p>Nothing beat first hand experience. If we were studying population density, we&#x27;d be taken to a nearby town and would spend a Sunday measuring frontages and documenting usage, to then graph the data and draw our own conclusions. The fascinating takeaway on that was that houses nearer water were usually poorer - rich folks could afford to live up hills and have water carried to them. Properties get rebuilt, frontages have a habit of staying the same, or in multiples of their original size. Stuff I would not know or even think about were it not for this experience. Chemistry was always &quot;here&#x27;s the thing you need to do. Here&#x27;s a mystery bag of reagents and kit. Figure it out. I&#x27;ll keep an eye in case you stray into danger.&quot; Two examples, but it was the core of how they taught sciences - make us do our own investigations, and ask us the right questions to precipitate the correct lines of thought. They nudged me into coding the same way - &quot;there are some dusty old BBC micros and some magazines about how to use them in the basement. You guys figure it out.&quot;. We figured it out so well that we got the machine with the vocaliser to cuss at the teacher when he entered input into a fake basic prompt, and went on to make a &quot;Hugo&quot; clone set at the school. Also just recalled being taught normal distributions by being told to go count car colours outside the school gates.<p>Anyway, the upshot is that from that class, of those I&#x27;ve kept in touch, all still have a childlike curiosity about the world, myself included.<p>I think we were taught to think for ourselves in the most earnest way - something which is increasingly missing in education today. Fuck, we were allowed access to guns, a deep lake with floating islands, abandoned underground cool stores - all on trust alone - and if you violated that trust you lost it, and you were <i>punished</i>.

The background image was of 2 men kissing. Let&#x27;s be charitable to the student and assume that it was not pornographic. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that the student was hoping that the teacher would inadvertently show this image on an overhead projector to the whole class. If setting up a male teacher to show an image of homosexuals was not intended to negatively affect his reputation then what was the intent?<p>If on the other hand the image was pornographic in nature then I&#x27;m confident that any 14 year old would know that &quot;Mr.Blogs will get in lots of trouble for this!!!Lolz!!1!!&quot;<p><pre><code>   > in this case the teacher went absolutely overboard in going after the student

This is not how schools work. A teacher does not &quot;go after&quot; students. They report the incident and school administrators take it from there. And i&#x27;ll state it again - I am not in favor of the felony escalation of this issue!<p>In a previous response you equated this &quot;prank&quot; to posting an image on the back of a chalkboard.<p>Equating the two is deeply flawed. The chalkboard does not have any access control. The default response is : &quot;hey some kid posted a stupid picture... lol!&quot;. A computer on the other hand <i>does</i> have access control. The default response then becomes &quot;wow the <i>authorised user</i> of this computer set the background image to 2 gay men kissing&quot;. This is not a subtle difference.

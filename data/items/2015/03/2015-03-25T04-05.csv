Differing value systems do not guarantee conflict, especially if there are common interests and economic interdependence. Common value systems also don&#x27;t prevent it... Witness the centuries and centuries of bloody conflict that has raged between humans of the same religious belief system, ethnic group, and even the same language and similar culture (e.g. the perpetual Middle East bloodbath).<p>A wildly alien AI might actually have fewer reasons to fight with humans. It might simply carve out some economic niche to earn income to purchase what it needs, and go exist in some physical and/or virtual enclave somewhere. Last I checked Antarctica was big, uninhabited, and reduces the need for active cooling. Then there is space. Why wouldn&#x27;t an AI with no interest in living with humans just go to the Moon? There are points on the Lunar surface in perpetual daylight, meaning tons of free energy. Lots of mineral resources, lava tubes big enough for cities, and no oxygen, mold, fungi, water, or meat sacks, and surely a superintelligence could do something valuable enough to buy a couple hundred heavy lift rocket launches. Funny if Elon who seems worried about AI got it as a customer. :)<p>Like I said: I see no intrinsic reason AI is more dangerous than the 350000 other minds born daily.",1427259538

The threat to FB or any similarly dominant company isn&#x27;t head-on, but rather sideways, where peripheral businesses could eat into their core. So far, Facebook is doing a pretty good job of recognizing those risks.<p>An interesting exercise is to think of how companies have handled those risks and the effects of that. Eg, IBM&#x27;s stance on software as they gave Microsoft exclusive licensing rights, only to backtrack with OS/2 and giving up. Microsoft dismissing the Internet, then playing &quot;me-too&quot; ever since with Bing, Windows Phone, Azure, etc etc. Google&#x27;s social networking efforts with Orkut, Buzz and Plus.<p>> less than even odds of being the social king when, say, 2030 rolls around.<p>Agreed, when you&#x27;re dominating a competitive industry, it&#x27;s pretty hard to stay on top indefinitely.

I&#x27;m a libertarian, and I use that in the non-US definition of the word, which is to say I&#x27;m an anarcho-syndicalist. Unfortunately anarchism is widely regarded as unrealistic, but if it weren&#x27;t for the Soviets mucking around in Spain in the 30&#x27;s, it might be a very different story.<p>What is anarchism? Here&#x27;s how Noam Chomsky, (the same Chomsky you know from your compilers / CS theory course) describes it:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Well, anarchism is, in my view, basically a kind of tendency in human thought which shows up in different forms in different circumstances, and has some leading characteristics.<p>Primarily it is a tendency that is suspicious and skeptical of domination, authority, and hierarchy.  It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified.  It assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them.  Their authority is not self-justifying.  They have to give a reason for it, a justification.  And if they can’t justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just.  And, as I understand it, anarchy is just that tendency.  It takes different forms at different times.<p>Anarcho-syndicalism is a particular variety of anarchism which was concerned primarily, though not solely, but primarily with control over work, over the work place, over production.  It took for granted that working people ought to control their own work, its conditions, [that] they ought to control the enterprises in which they work, along with communities, so they should be associated with one another in free associations, and … democracy of that kind should be the foundational elements of a more general free society.  And then, you know, ideas are worked out about how exactly that should manifest itself, but I think that is the core of anarcho-syndicalist thinking.  I mean it’s not at all the general image that you described — people running around the streets, you know, breaking store windows — but [anarcho-syndicalism] is a conception of a very organized society, but organized from below by direct participation at every level, with as little control and domination as is feasible, maybe none.
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>One big misconception is that anarchism means that there should be no laws, and that murderers should be allowed to wander the streets. What a lot of people don&#x27;t know is that anarchism, just like communism, was also a victim of the propaganda machine that we now call the red scare.<p>I think that a lot of people in tech, who can directly see how open source killed proprietary software, are the people who are most open to the idea this shift can happen.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s just my $0.02.<p>If you made it this far into my comment, give this a read: <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/noam-chomsky-kind-anarchism-i-believe-and-whats-wrong-libertarians"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/noam-chomsky-kind-an...</a><p>And also read On Anarchism by Chomsky, it&#x27;s fantastic.

And nearly all of the developers of those technologies are now in the illumos community and notably <i>not</i> at Oracle.<p>Specifically, Dtrace is primarily the brain child of Bryan Cantrill of Joyent (co-developed with Adam Leventhal of Delphix and Mike Shapiro who left Oracle in 2010) and Jerry Jelinek of Joyent was one of the primary developers of Zones. Matt Ahrens and George Wilson, co-developers of ZFS along with Jeff Bohnwick, are now at Delphix with Adam. Though, as far as I know, Jeff is no longer involved with ZFS development.<p>All major features of Solaris 11 were developed in OpenSolaris. Solaris 11.1 major features are improvements to SMF, the installer, and the addition of ASLR. Major features in Solaris 11.2 are &quot;kernel zones&quot;, OpenStack and SDN [1].

So you would expect to see any new competitor do the same.<p>Second, the &quot;buy competitors&quot; approach only works as long as competitors are willing to sell.  Eventually one won&#x27;t.  Don&#x27;t forget that Facebook tried to buy Snapchat for $3B in 2013, and failed.  Based on emails leaked last year in the Sony fiasco, if they can beat Facebook, they will.

A child was born, a nearly blank slate, and formed into &#x27;you&#x27; by experiences.<p>The idea that you could have been born &quot;somewhere else&quot; or &quot;to someone else&quot; or &quot;in another time&quot; is a nonsense idea. We know exactly what happens to children born elsewhere and elsewhen and to other parents - they become <i>other people</i>. Not people we clairvoyantly share qualia with, not people we are superimposed-upon or people we are hiding-inside, not &quot;us&quot; in any way shape or form, just 100% other people.<p>Following that, the idea that someone could be born twice also seems nonsensical. (Boltzmann Brains excepted; MichaelOChurch2015 might appear for a few Plancktimes in the near heat-death void. Not that we&#x27;ll ever know).<p>The first point; moment by moment in life we experience our surroundings. Continuous sensory input which we continually respond to in large and small scales from planning the next week to blinking and shifting in our seats. I suspect this pervasive connection from experience to physical reality to be fundamental to qualia and consciousness, and so the idea that we could go to an afterlife with no body, no senses, no time, no drive for physical sustenance - and still in any way remain who we are - doesn&#x27;t fit.<p>If you don&#x27;t get up in the morning, because you have no body and didn&#x27;t sleep, and you aren&#x27;t in your normal environment, you don&#x27;t put on your clothes because they don&#x27;t exist anymore along with all your other property, don&#x27;t breakfast or exercise, don&#x27;t stretch your achey ankle, don&#x27;t prepare yourself for your day filled with not going places and not doing things that could affect the organisation of matter and cash, and you don&#x27;t do all that in absense-of-time and there are no faces to recognise... then who are &quot;you&quot; in such an afterlife anyway?

There are two main pragmatic reasons for this: it lets the compiler keep the existing default of being able to jump directly to a known address in the common case (i.e. you don&#x27;t pay for functionality you don&#x27;t use), and it lets you know whenever the code that is executed may not be the code that you&#x27;re staring at.  If you rely on a particular method being called and it is overridden, then your program becomes incorrect, in the sense that it may do something completely arbitrary that you never expected.<p>In Java, we have the keyword &#x27;new&#x27; because we needed a syntactic marker to indicate whenever heap allocation may occur.  Without it, any object construction may trigger a long-running garbage collection.  If you rely on object construction being a fast operation and it triggers a GC, then your program becomes incorrect, in the sense that it may not return results in the timeframe necessary.  This is why Java faced significant barriers to entering the hard real-time space, and that market is still dominated by C and Ada.<p>In Scheme, we have the special form &#x27;delay&#x27; to indicate that an expression should be lazily evaluated.  Without it, side-effects become unpredictable, and you may also get unexpected space-leaks or execution cascades.  If you rely on an operation being strict and instead it&#x27;s lazy, then your program becomes incorrect, in the sense that it may execute side-effects at unknown times or have non-local execution effects.<p>Java decided that the &#x27;virtual&#x27; keyword was not necessary, and omitted it in the interests of reducing language complexity.  Python decided that the &#x27;new&#x27; keyword was not necessary, and omitted it in the interests of reducing language complexity.  Scheme decided that something like &#x27;chain&#x27; is not necessary, and omitted it in the interests of reducing language complexity.  Haskell decided that &#x27;delay&#x27; is not necessary, and omitted it in the interests of reducing language complexity.<p>In all cases, there <i>are</i> situations where that omission comes back to bite users of the language.  Java re-introduced @Override to indicate overridden methods.  Python isn&#x27;t used in performance-critical software where you want object-creation to be fast.  Scheme code is often brittle, where a simple change to the method results in very different stack consumption.  Haskell code often has unpredictably space leaks and execution time.<p>And yet all of those languages have users, some more niche than others.<p>My argument isn&#x27;t really about what Python should or do, because realistically, Python is not getting any form of TRE, and I&#x27;m fine with that because I don&#x27;t use Python in a manner or situation that would require it.  But it&#x27;s that &quot;practically wrong&quot; is a relative term, relative to who&#x27;s using the language and what they&#x27;re doing with it.  Languages have complexity budgets as well; for all the people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> use a feature, the existence of that feature makes the language less useful to them.",1427258098

Particularly in a case where a bogus certificate is issued by an intermediate CA that rolls up to a root CA that is included in all the major browsers.<p>It seems to me that we have several building blocks available and it may be a combination we need:<p>1. CERTIFICATE PINNING (HPKP) - example: <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-21</a> - if a browser had previously pinned the certs of affected sites then it would have known that it was going to bogus sites and could have displayed a warning or prevented the user from going to those sites.<p>The challenge with pinning is that somehow you have to learn what to pin before you visit a site, either by having the pinset or certs pre-loaded into the app/browser or simply by doing Trust On First Use (TOFU). Additionally, if the first use is to the site controlled by an attacker, the cert that gets pinned in the browser could in fact be the <i>attacker&#x27;s</i> cert, which could make recovery difficult.<p>Which brings us to...<p>2. DANE/DNSSEC - <a href=""http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/resources/dane/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/resources/dane/</a> - with DANE (RFC 6698) you put a fingerprint (or an entire cert) into a TLSA record in DNS and then sign that with DNSSEC. A browser or app that supported DANE could deal with the TOFU issue by doing a DANE check to verify the cert that it is receiving from the web server. This would then effectively bootstrap the cert pinning process by providing a way to test the validity of the cert.<p>Because the DANE TLSA records are entered by the owner/operator of the domain and then through DS records are tied into a validated chain-of-trust up to the root of DNS, it would be difficult for an attacker to subvert this with his/her malicious TLSA records.<p>But we have a third layer to help...<p>3. CERTIFICATE TRANSPARENCY (CT) - <a href=""http://www.certificate-transparency.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.certificate-transparency.org/</a> - CT provides a way to log all the issued certs and have browsers/apps check those logs through an auditor.  When the browser gets the TLS cert, it also gets a signed cert timestamp (SCT) and can use that through an auditor component to check if the cert is valid.     The challenge is that right now only some CAs log issuance of certs and only some browsers/apps check via an auditor.  (I also don’t understand myself exactly how real-time CT is, but that may just be that I need to understand the SCT mechanism better.)<p>To me these three different components can work together to provide a higher degree of trust: cert pinning to help with the speed of connecting to frequently-visited sites; DANE to help with the first use/key learning issue[1]; and CT to provide another means of checking the cert validity.<p>Comments?<p>[1] And yes, DANE could be used to store entire TLS certs separately, but right now I’m looking at how these pieces could be used together to give the maximum efficiency and security.",1427257875

For mass media (TV, news, social), the scarcity relationship is reversed: you&#x27;re effectively competing for the user&#x27;s time and attention. Almost zero-sum, especially when considering the allocation of advertising dollars.<p>Additionally, the barrier of entry is low, since anyone can make a Twitter clone in 20 lines of Ruby on Rails. So you&#x27;d be trying to carve out a niche in social, fighting against network effects and the dozen other college dropouts working on the same idea, while hoping Facebook won&#x27;t decide to implement your differentiating feature. That&#x27;s not easy.<p>> Attracting and retaining users that will pay you is hard.<p>For purely discretionary purchases, yes. This is what makes the success of eg, Viber all the more remarkable. They made a $900 million business by selling electronic stickers. Anyone can sell stupid stickers, but it takes sheer execution to get $900 million for it. Not easy at all.<p>Since it&#x27;s so difficult to get paying users in social, you can hedge by relying on a (slightly) less elastic source of revenue: selling those eyeballs and clicks to advertisers. But the traffic needs to be high and consistent for a scalable operation. And again, you&#x27;re back to square one. Not so easy.",1427257256

While I certainly don&#x27;t intend to convince you that it&#x27;s an afterlife experience (because no one knows quite what they are) it is typically positive and very powerful. Subjectively, it&#x27;s an intense spiritual experience that seems to be unmatched by most things in life. As for whether it&#x27;s entrance into an afterlife or the shutdown sequence of a dying brain... who knows? I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have that answered within our natural lifespan. Both you and I are likely to die before we, as a species, know whether there&#x27;s an afterlife. So we have to go into death without full knowledge but, to be honest, we go into <i>every experience</i> without full knowledge. Tomorrow we might wake up and find that the sky is purple. It&#x27;s extremely unlikely, but it could happen.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m as irreligious as you are but I tend to think the odds are better than even that there&#x27;s some consciousness after death, although &quot;after&quot; might not be the right word because I&#x27;m not sure whether time is even well-defined outside of this physical universe. Presuming that I came from nothing, that means that &quot;nothing&quot; can produce qualia, which means that if I become &quot;nothing&quot; after death... it makes a plausible case for rebirth. As Voltaire said, &quot;It is not more surprising to be born twice than once.&quot;<p>So, if the last moments of this life are a positive experience and the &quot;next moment&quot; is either nonexistent or a continuation that might be called an &quot;afterlife&quot;, then I don&#x27;t see much to worry about either way. Of course, others&#x27; deaths are still really hard to take, and I&#x27;m a hypochondriac who hates the thought of sickness (for the embarrassment and sense of failure, not the danger) but I don&#x27;t fear my own impending death.

I&#x27;ve chatted with my manager about my side projects but if he started <i>demanding</i> to know everything, I would find it very rude and intrusive, and it would greatly lower my opinion of him. What I do off-hours and unrelated to the business is not something a manager has a <i>right</i> to know.

It&#x27;s not obvious to me where the mistake is:<p>&quot;For a projectile entirely to escape the gravitation of earth, it needs a velocity of 7 miles a second. The thermal energy of a gramme at this speed is 15,180 calories... The energy of our most violent explosive--nitroglycerine--is less than 1,500 calories per gramme. Consequently, even had the explosive nothing to carry, it has only one-tenth of the energy necessary to escape the earth... Hence the proposition appears to be basically impossible.&quot;",1427256032

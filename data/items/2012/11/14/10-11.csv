I can get 3% risk free right now in the UK (cash investment) and five years of that is (compounded) 16%.<p>The question is can he get the fund back to it's current value plus 16% in five years?<p>Because it's not just about how quickly he can start paying into it again, it's about how quickly he can get it back to it's current value (or it's current value plus 16%), so he's got a comparable amount when the interest rates do pick up.<p>Even if it doesn't pick up and 3% is the new norm, that still compounds over 20 years to doubling it's current value. Is he going to be able to / be willing to make up that money in some other way during that period?<p>That's all a bit all over the place but the point is that low rates aren't nothing (particularly not when compounded), and even with low returns rebuilding that fund isn't going to be trivial.",1352890492

4782855,comment,4781563,4782030,5,0,vidarh,,,"If someone I worked with tried pulling a 36 hour shift I'd physically throw them out of the building.<p>In my mind, odds are 90%+ that'd they'd do more damage (more bugs, slowing down other people) than they'd do good in aggregate over that 36 window, and odds that they'd be more productive in a single 36 hour bout than doing shifts with proper sleep windows is pretty much 0.<p>More than 14 hours or so in a single stretch is highly unlikely to be beneficial to the company/project, <i>with</i> rest in the middle.<p>More than just being in line with research, this is in line with what I've seen over and over again in real projects, where best project during crunch time is generally had by ensuring people leave and rest. Sure, do longer hours for a short period. Sure, ask people to <i>cut down</i> on time off or alternate work/sleep shifts.<p>But the moment your developers hits 18-20 hours, I could talk most of them into making horrifically bad decisions and have them think they were logically sound - your ability to reason goes out the window pretty quickly. I don't want people in that kind of state anywhere near projects I work on, because I've seen what they can, and will, do in the belief they're helping out.<p>> What if they don't have much on their resumes and are excited to make this a successful project, instead of a laughingstock that fell over in the face of scaling challenges? What if they care about each other and want to make this a success for their friends and coworkers?<p>Then learning to understand that there's nothing smart about pulling stunts like this unless you're doing menial work that you can still do reasonably reliably with next to no concentration or short term memory is even more important.<p>> I hope they feel happy and like they accomplished a lot in the face of long odds, and you should too.<p>No, I shouldn't, because if they feel that way they've learned the wrong lesson. They'd also most likely be wrong in terms of their relative productivity with more rest. Unless they were all on illegal stimulants, or his staff consists of mutants, it is simply not worth spending much time even considering the option that this might somehow have been the best way for them to spend their time.",1352890377

4782850,comment,4763564,4780455,1,0,lmm,,,">What's the difference between this:\n>STYLE.on(""element"", {textAlign: ""center"", fontSize: 50})\n>or this:\n>element style=""text-align: center; font-size: 50px;""\n>or this: .element {text-align: center; font-size: 50px;}<p>The difference is that CSS has its own syntax, its own semantics, and its own set of gotchas to learn, different from any other language. (Obviously for a simple selector like .element it's easy to know what it's going to refer to, but CSS is not limited to things that are so clear).<p>>Now, if you need to change that text-align to left you have to change every instance of it throughout your code, except for the third where it only needs to be changed once.<p>Only if you're a muppet. Your HTML is being generated by a program; that program should have a single place where it knows what the text-align of this class (in the general sense of the term) of elements should be, and you can change it in that one place if you want to change it.<p>>Plus, there's the issue that if you want this web page to be indexed by search engines you're going to have problems. If people have turned javascript off or use a white list to control scripts then this page simply will not work with very little available fallback.<p>Right; it only makes sense to use javascript if you're already using javascript for major functionality. That's what I'm really advocating for here: write your styling logic in the same language as the rest of your site's logic.<p>>Keep in mind this thread started for me because of your statement that CSS is not powerful enough to express styling when that's exactly what it does and all that it does.<p>My point was that it isn't powerful enough to express your styling in a fully abstracted way. E.g. if your website's general colour scheme is blue and you have parts that are a light blue, a mid blue and a dark blue, CSS doesn't let you define these colours in terms of each other - so if you want to change it to be green, you have to change three different colour definitions. Because of this kind of thing, people use pre-processors like LESS - which means using yet another language with its own syntax and logic to learn, when you're already using a perfectly good programming language to generate most of your site.<p>>CSS selectors let you target elements in your markup to style them, nothing else. You can use these selectors to reuse your CSS stylings for duplicate elements that require the same styling.<p>Yes, that was why I took pains to say ""some small specific parts of your markup"". Your styles are part of your markup, at least traditionally.",1352890279

The one language I see on the horizon of even having a chance at displacing C++ at the top companies is Rust. A lot of companies already make use of custom scripting languages for parts of the game logic or design or AI behavior, some of them even use Python or Lua. If that trend continues to gain in popularity and, just as importantly, if toolchains capable of working with such environments improve or are created in the first place, we might see C++ relegated to graphics- and physics-engine stuff only (and slowly dying there) whereas the rest of a AAA game is in a higher level language.

You can use the software as much as you want, just as long as you contribute back your changes to others.  An enforced quid-pro-quo, if you will.<p>I absolutely understand the argument that Linus is making, and I agree with him - that, long term, people need to be driven by the need to satisfy some personal need, not some greater community good.

After comparing the new account name with part of my email, I came to the conclusion that someone mistyped their email address, and registered an account on my address. I contacted their live support, here's the conversation:<p><pre><code>    George A: Hello! Welcome to Skype Live Support! My name is George. How\n    may I help you?\n\n    me: Recently I have received an email welcoming me to Skype (not\n    phishing, I verified). The problem is that I didn't create the account\n    mentioned in the email. The account name was ""[NEW SKYPE ACCOUNT]"" and\n    my email is [MY EMAIL 1], so I think that user mistyped his email\n    address, and then Skype sent a welcome message to me. Doesn't skype\n    verifies email addresses before sending a welcome message?\n\n    George A: I understand that you are concerned about your email address\n    being used to setup a Skype account, I'll be happy to help you with\n    that.  May I please have your Skype Name?\n\n    me: [MY SKYPE ACCOUNT]\n\n    George A: I would also need the email address, please.\n\n    me: [MY EMAIL 1]. let me check that this address in on my Skype\n    account... ok, my email on file in Skype is [MY EMAIL 2].  and a few\n    other too, all mine :)\n\n    George A: Well, I see that there is only Skype Name registered under\n    that email address, the Skype Name is [NEW SKYPE ACCOUNT]\n\n    me: Yes, for my account ([MY SKYPE ACCOUNT]) the primary email is [MY\n    EMAIL 2], but other emails on profile are [MY EMAIL 1], [MY EMAIL 2],\n    [MY EMAIL 3].\n\n    George A: May I please ask you to confirm which Skype Name that you do\n    not authorize?\n\n    me: Does Skype sends verification message before assigning the email\n    to account? The Skype name which I didn't create is [NEW SKYPE\n    ACCOUNT]\n\n    George A: May I also have the email address that was used?\n\n    me: [MY EMAIL 1]\n\n    George A: Well, I would need to send you a confirmation to that email\n    address. I would kindle need you to reply back to that email.\n\n    me: Please do\n\n    George A: Then, we will be able to delete that Skype Name for you.\n\n    me: thank you\n\n    George A: You are most welcomed, please expect me email within 10\n    minutes.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n    me: Could you tell me if email accounts that are registered with Skype\n    are being verified by sending a message to them? If so, maybe there's\n    bug in your system?\n\n    George A: We send a welcome email to the registered email address\n    whenever a new account is set up using that email.\n\n    me: OK, that's what I received. And then you also send other emails\n    with offers to the same account. So, basically, anyone can create an\n    account for any email. Why don't you verify emails?\n\n    George A: Please understand that all of us here at Skype take our\n    customers' privacy and confidentiality very seriously\n\n    me: OK. Thank you.\n\n    George A: You are most welcomed. It's been a pleasure speaking with\n    you today. Thank you for contacting Skype Live Support, have a great\n    day. We value your feedback. Please be aware that we will ask you a\n    few questions after closing the chat window about your experience with\n    us today.  Once you are ready please click on the ""Exit"" button.\n\n    me: I suggest adding a link to Welcome email that says ""I didn't\n    create this account"". Bye!\n\n</code></pre>\nRealizing that there's nothing this support person can do about this, I sent email to their ""security"" people. I received no reply.<p>And now this failure to verify emails leads to the linked vulnerability. Nice.",1352888765

4782781,comment,4781894,4782753,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""Is this OOP?""<p>Okay, that's beyond my pay grade. I could argue that either way. OOP is the grouping of data and functionality into units called types or classes. So yes, technically, but I know what you mean.<p>I agree that Java is a bad way to start, but I wonder if I wouldn't come at it from just the opposite angle. Start with C, move to structs, then move to something like the class you show, then to more complex type creation. After all, C++, probably the most widely-used OOPL on the planet, started with the problems of scaling C.<p>The problem here is the confusion between ""the way things work in language X"" and ""the way things generally are"". I think you need a few OOP languages, and perhaps some functional ones too, under your belt to be able to understand that.<p>What I think you're getting at is <i>problem-solving strategies</i>. There is a certain problem-solving strategy available in OOP that doesn't make much sense in FP. Many functional guys look at OOP and say something like ""It all looks like just a bunch of wiring"" -- which is true but misses the point. It works the same in FP, they have ways of solving problems differently than the OOP guys, but that's for another day.<p>In either case, starting with Java is not so good, if for no other reason than you end up in namespace-land with even the simplest code. Start simple, either with Smalltalk or with C, and work in the more complex pieces.<p>Note: I _do_ think that any OOP learning experience should end with creating your own robust type system, just like I think any FP learning experience with creating your own parser and compiler. But this also is a topic for another day.",1352888659

Sure, you can pull more than 8 hours now and again. Sure, you can even pull all nighters now and again.<p>But over a 36 hour period the vast majority of peoples productivity at complex tasks will nosedive well before half way, and stay flat to even <i>negative</i> in jobs like software development, as you slow down other people and negatively impact communications once you get too tired.<p>If you want the most amount of work done in 36 hours, you don't make people work the whole 36 hours.",1352888617

4782753,comment,4781894,4782709,13,0,bad_user,,,"Most people that have a problem with OOP are conflating it with how OOP gets used in Java.<p>Like if you wanted to represent a RGB pixel on screen, in Java that ends-up being a class having methods like draw() and such. And this is the problem with OOP in Java, because of the limited toolset, you always end up having heavy Objects that have their own behavior instead of functions that operate on a whole composite of such values. Having draw() defined for a pixel is pretty bad design and yet people do it anyway.<p>Also, some of the common complaints about OOP classes (e.g. you end up having to write boilerplate, like when defining getters and setters and equals and hashCode) are again related to Java and Java-like bureaucratic OOP languages. In Scala all you have to do is this:<p><pre><code>    case class RGB(r: Int, g: Int, b: Int)\n</code></pre>\nIs it statically type-safe with a good self-documenting structure? Yes. Is it just a simple tuple? Yes. And under the hood Scala also generates a proper equals() with structural equality and the right getters/setters for the values, because in Scala (like in Smalltalk) member access is always done through a method call. And because it is also a class, you can also attach things to the constructor, like runtime checks to make it even more type-safe:<p><pre><code>    case class RGB(r: Int, g: Int, v: Int) {\n      require(r >= 0 && r < 256, ""r must be a value between 0 and 255"")\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIs this OOP? That's indeed a class, but saying that programming with classes as types is OOP is like saying that programming with functions is functional programming.<p>In my opinion Java should never be taught as an introductory language and in universities people should really get exposure to pure forms of OOP, like Smalltalk and CLOS.",1352887755

A good thing to search for could be Cydia, but there are alternative package managers. MobileSubstrate isn't a sure bet either, but I suppose it's a far cry safer than Cydia. An additional method could be trying to map a page you can both write to and execute, which should fail unless specific kernel patches indicative of a jailbreak have been applied (or you're a webview with Nitro enabled.)<p>The best method, however, is to <i>not care</i>, because if you do it's for the sake of either tracking/analytics or screwing over your users.",1352887679

There have been comments which suggests that some fonts are smaller than you'd want on the mini but the other side of that is that there is no one ""right"" font size. When I was in my 20s frankly the smaller the better, now I've turned 40 I'm happier with larger.<p>I agree configurability can be a cop out (and iOS is almost a monument to that view) but there are some things where there are really good reasons why you might make it something the user can work with and this feels like one.",1352887529

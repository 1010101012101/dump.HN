I&#x27;m not saying that someone&#x27;s moderate comfort improvement is worth more than your actual pain -- but the selfish, horrible behavior is <i>not</i> on the part of the passenger in front of you.<p>It&#x27;s the horrible, selfish airline&#x27;s fault.<p>They are the ones jamming as many seats as possible into an aircraft, and overselling every flight. It&#x27;s a business; I get it. Still, though, it&#x27;s difficult to blame someone who is <i>also</i> cramped into a seat in coach from trying to get as much comfort as they can out of the situation. The other (unaddressed) problem is the &quot;domino effect&quot; of seat reclining. If someone in front of you reclines their seat, you lose a significant amount of space -- and the only way to compensate for that is to also recline yours.<p>If you don&#x27;t think people should be allowed to recline their seat a few inches, take it up with the airlines, not the passengers.",1409165890

Which is to say, that when you hit undefined behavior, the compiler would be completely within its rights to make demons fly out of your nose.<p>&quot;Undefined behavior&quot; means the compiler can do anything. In your example, the compiler could execute one statement but not the other. Or it could execute both of them fifteen times. Or it could reformat your hard drive, or start a war. All would be legal according to the spec. (Feasibility of implementing such things is, of course, another question.) The more mundane consequences are more likely to be what you actually see, but the point is that you can&#x27;t really reason about it in the abstract. You have to know exactly how your particular compiler handles it, and it can go well beyond just executing your code in a funny way.<p>For one real-world that approaches &quot;nasal demons&quot;, early versions of gcc would start a game of nethack if they encountered a #pragma statement in your program.",1409165566

An EEG picked up those motor-based signals from the subject&#x27;s brain.<p>Then that binary information was sent to another location, where transcranial magnetic stimulation was used on the &quot;receivers,&quot; who sensed the 1s as visual stimuli and the 0s as no visual stimuli.  After each bit was communicated, they told the researchers whether they saw any visual stimuli.<p>In other words, the &quot;emitter&quot; didn&#x27;t just think of a word and that word somehow magically popped into the heads of the receivers.  We&#x27;re a loooooong way off from that.<p>In fact, if I&#x27;m understanding this correctly, the entire gimmick about words like &quot;hola&quot; and &quot;ciao&quot; being transmitted is misleading, or at least irrelevant in terms of what was actually achieved.<p>Really, the best way to sum this up is:<p>Binary information is transmitted with significant accuracy using non-invasive neural sensors (for detection) and non-invasive neural stimuli (for reception).<p>And indeed, I have a sneaking suspicion that neither the accurate detection of binary signals using EEG nor the accurate communication of binary signals using TMS is particularly groundbreaking ... in which case, the only thing novel about this study is that the researchers decided to pair the two.<p>EDIT: Actually, the paper seems to be implying that accurate communication of binary signals in a computer-to-brain interface is indeed groundbreaking (From the introduction: &quot;the realization of non-invasive CBI in humans remains elusive&quot;) but if that were so, one would think that the EEG component of the study introduces needlessly complexity; the researchers could just as easily begin with a predefined stream of 1s and 0s, rather than trying to extract them from someone else&#x27;s brain.",1409165450

A hostile interview is any interview in which the interviewers are actively trying to remove the candidate from the pool. This can be a very subtle thing; as an interviewer, you have to ask yourself: Am I asking questions in order to attempt to weed out this candidate? Does this question have a right and wrong answer? And if so, what does it mean if they get it wrong? Did I simply discover a limit of their knowledge, or is it more ominous?<p>An important point is that you can be quite friendly and amenable, while still asking hostile questions intended to directly weed out candidates, as opposed to plumbing the depth and breadth of their knowledge and experiences.<p>[1] <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other-half-works-an-adventure-in-the-low-status-of-software-engineers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other...</a>",1409165434

If you had something like:<p><pre><code>    int i = [UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR];\n    if (i > 0)\n        COND1;\n    if (i > 0)\n        COND2;\n</code></pre>\nthen most people would expect that either COND1 and COND2 both execute, or they both don&#x27;t execute. But I believe that a compiler is theoretically free to produce code that executes one but not the other since the value of i is undefined. In other words, the compiler doesn&#x27;t have to act as though i has one specific value after that assignment. It can assume any value it likes independently each time i is used. It can assume that i is positive at the first check and then assume it&#x27;s negative the next time, even though it might be provably true that no code between those two checks can possibly change the value of i. The change to &quot;unspecified value&quot; would mean that the compiler can give i whatever value it wants to, but it has to be a single defined value, and subsequent code must not behave as though i had multiple changing values.<p>But I&#x27;m not really a C programmer, so feel free to correct me if I&#x27;m interpreting this wrong.",1409165227

You seem to switch between making a principled stand and trying to save money, depending on whatever&#x27;s more convenient at the time. Which makes the &quot;principled stand&quot; sound like a crock. So let&#x27;s concentrate on the price.<p>First of all, how do you decide that $200 is OK but $350 is not OK? The airline industry is pretty competitive. If one doesn&#x27;t offer what you want, use one that does. If none of them offer what you want, it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s not actually cost effective (assuming that it&#x27;s legal).<p>Secondly, you&#x27;re just wrong about the cost. I picked a United roundtrip between IAD and SFO, and they want a whopping $84 for Economy Plus on the outbound leg, and $79 on the return leg, on top of a $414 base roundtrip fare. That&#x27;s $174 extra for the roundtrip, within the range you state as acceptable. For another example, I flew IAD-PEK on United earlier this year, and it was $200 each way for Economy plus, on a $1,400/person trip that takes 14 hours each way.<p>I checked on American and for a similar trip they wanted $50-60 per flight for &quot;Main Cabin Extra&quot; which is their equivalent. Finally, I checked JetBlue, which cost a total of $115 extra each way for &quot;Even More Space&quot;.<p>Now, one might expect you to delighted at this, since apparently you didn&#x27;t know before, and it&#x27;s exactly what you asked for.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, most people against patents do not reason about their philosophy making it harder to convince the authorities against patents.<p>My understanding is that before patents, people and companies would invent but keep their invention a trade secret for as long as they can, which meant they had exclusivity to the invention.  Patents allow such exclusivity for a limited period of time in exchange of disclosing the invention and losing rights over it after a specified period.<p>The patents applicability criterion correspondingly includes non-obviousness which is to judge if someone else could come up with the same invention without investing significant time and effort or not.  Majority of the ideas are &quot;supposed to be&quot; ruled out by this criterion.<p>The state of the affairs however is that most obvious of the things get patented because (1) obviousness is unmeasurable, and (2) searching the prior art fully is impractical.<p>Short message:  You cannot call all swans white simply because most you see are white.",1409165140

In C right now, there isn&#x27;t any guarantee your code will actually keep going since it&#x27;s UD, with an &#x27;undefined value&#x27; I presume it means you still get some type of number and your code keeps going with that bad number (Which may or may not have bad consequences.

I think they&#x27;re just trying to specify something more specific then UD, like a SIGSEGV (or whatever signal thing Windows does).

I&#x27;d imagine that the idea that social skills and technical ability are inversely correlated has led to similar things.<p>But also, my experience in TAing the weed out course for the CS major (and from seeing my fellow TAs teach and work, who were more or less the best in class at my University--so much so that I was flown out by a company simply because of my involvement in that class) was that social skills had absolutely no correlation to technical ability:  your ability to understand how pointers or complex data structures worked had absolutely no relation to how socially fluent you were.  In fact, it often went the opposite way, up to a point:  there was some base line of social fluency that everyone I worked with and the best people I taught seemed to meet.  The single best coder I have /ever/ seen work (he alone makes me absolutely certain that the best people in our industry are 10x/100x more productive than the average) was also one of the most comfortable with people and had a very clear idea of his career goals.  I&#x27;d expect him to give confident, unhesitating responses to &quot;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s your greatest strength/weakness?&quot;  Negatively weighting that would mean you&#x27;d miss the hands down most productive person I&#x27;ve ever seen work:  and you&#x27;d probably miss a decent number of the other people I taught with.  (Who, as I said, were basically the cream of the crop from the program I was in. Not all of the best people were there, but all of the people there were among the best.)<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re particularly good interview questions, even though I understand why they&#x27;re asked.  I think that asking questions about actual workplace soft skills (conflict resolution, for instance) would be a much better use of everyone&#x27;s time, since in the end it&#x27;s those things that actually hold a team together.",1409165101

8233925,comment,8233916,8233916,1,0,d0mine,,,"> Choosing UTF-8 aims to treat formatting text for communication with the user as &quot;just a display issue&quot;. It&#x27;s a low impact design that will &quot;just work&quot; for a lot of software, but it comes at a price:<p>>  - because encoding consistency checks are mostly avoided, data in different encodings may be freely concatenated and passed on to other applications. Such data is typically not usable by the receiving application.<p>>   - for interfaces without encoding information available, it is often necessary to assume an appropriate encoding in order to display information to the user, or to transform it to a different encoding for communication with another system that may not share the local system&#x27;s encoding assumptions. These assumptions may not be correct, but won&#x27;t necessarily cause an error - the data may just be silently misinterpreted as something other than what was originally intended.<p>>   - because data is generally decoded far from where it was introduced, it can be difficult to discover the origin of encoding errors.<p>It seems surrogateescape error handler introduces these issues back (only for Unicode strings instead of bytes this time) i.e., a+b is no longer well-defined (a, b Unicode strings may have lone surrogates due to different reasons). JSON permits lone surrogates in its strings so the data can easily spread over the network too.<p>>   - as a variable width encoding, it is more difficult to develop efficient string manipulation algorithms for UTF-8. Algorithms originally designed for fixed width encodings will no longer work.<p>>   - as a specific instance of the previous point, it isn&#x27;t possible to split UTF-8 encoded text at arbitrary locations. Care needs to be taken to ensure splits only occur at code point boundaries.<p>It seems like a premature optimization to claim that UTF-8 being variable-width encoding is a performance bottleneck in most applications.<p>And if we want to show the data to a user then we should handle user-perceived characters (\\X regex) that may span several Unicode codepoints e.g., to avoid splitting a Unicode string inside a character.<p>---<p>Unicode by default is more complex than the article makes it appear to be e.g., see \U0001F385 𝕹 𝖔 𝕸 𝖆 𝖌 𝖎 𝖈 𝕭 𝖚 𝖑 𝖑 𝖊 𝖙 \U0001F385 (it is for Perl but Unicode issues are mostly universal) <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129</a>",1409164839

The arms are too low to properly rest my shoulders (forcing me essentially to either severely slouch or fold my arms the entire flight), the seats are too close to fully extend my legs, the seat itself has a slight incline so that your knees get particularly more uncomfortable, and the space to the next person (particularly with shared armrests, and overweight people) requires me to slightly bend away from them. All of this combines to muscle cramps in the back for a couple of days after flying. It&#x27;s really a miserable experience that I feel could be largely fixed by the airlines, if they weren&#x27;t in debt, greedy, or dieing. I don&#x27;t really blame the people in front of me for wanting to recline (I often do a couple of inches, though never the full length).

And I&#x27;ve been the asshole on the hiring end before - but I (hope) have learned my lesson.<p>I recently interviewed with a consultancy (role was UK-based) that is desperate (quite literally) to hire experienced developers in the technical area I have experience in. I came highly recommended by a recent senior hire of theirs (he had been my manager).<p>The technical filter question in the face-to-face interview was (paraphrased and simplified): &quot;write an algorithm on the whiteboard to check for mismatched braces&quot;.<p>I described an approximate solution aloud, but did not complete the solution in the interview.<p>As it happens I solved it in my sleep the following night - but of course they will never, ever know that.<p>Now everyone will have their pet theories as to why this is a good or bad question, but these are frankly moot because I am confident the hiring developer had <i>no idea</i> what he was testing for with it. He may have a vague &quot;I know the answer, so he should too&quot; mindset, but not much more.<p>What <i>does</i> this question, presented verbally in an interview really test? A recursive solution sprung to mind, but I can recall implementing recursive solutions in production code only a few tens of times over a ten year career. The question does not test for experience with the technology they are hiring for. It certainly filters out developers who cannot come up with an algorithm while standing at a whiteboard infront of a hostile audience. I could go on, but the biases implicit in this question are as numerous as they are irrelevant.<p>After a few years in the industry you typically get to work direct with these so-called &quot;top end&quot; consultancies anyway, so you get to know what these kind of questions <i>don&#x27;t</i> filter for. I can say with confidence and from experience they don&#x27;t filter for ability to create high quality software.<p>The thing is, this &#x27;clever&#x27; &#x27;does he know recursion?!&#x27; question is almost insultingly trivial when compared to the type of problems most development teams face.<p>Like the fact that although &quot;Joe&quot; has an IQ of 150, he speaks in sentences so impossibly convoluted he may as well be mute. Or &quot;Alice&quot; the sole domain expert, who begrudges her position in some way and will only communicate after you have negotiated the massive chip on her shoulder.<p>Hell, most organisations can&#x27;t even provision accurate testing environments and force their developers to run underpowered Windows laptops.<p>Let&#x27;s walk before we can run yeah?",1409163844

I need to do it dozens of times a day to do my job, as does any programmer.<p>I don&#x27;t program javascript at all, but am vaguely aware of the terrible implicit conversions it does. Isn&#x27;t that the important part? I do not have memorized that<p><pre><code>   false == &#x27;false&#x27;    // false, yet\n   false == &#x27;0&#x27;        // true\n</code></pre>\nWhy would I (I had to google that, took 5 seconds, btw)? It is ugly, terrible code. Sure, if I spend my days in a terrible code base I might be forced to learn those conversion rules, but that isn&#x27;t exactly the mark of a hirable person - it is just the employment history of that person.<p>Now, if somebody who claimed they knew javascript was writing &#x27;j := 0&#x27; for assignment I&#x27;d be concerned - but probably they&#x27;ve just been writing a lot of Go lately.<p>I can see a question like this being asked as part of a lead in to a more general discussion about types, type conversion, how different languages manage it and the trade offs thereof. But, most of the nit-picky questions I have ever been asked in an interview were just nit-picky. What is the output of the obfuscated C? What happens if you abuse the syntax like so? Just pointless questions compared to the real thing you should be measuring - can I produce high quality code on schedule and budget that adds value to the organization without making everyone around me wish they were dead rather than talk to me again? Can I recognize inefficieces in the company and improve things? Can I step up and lead a team or a project? If asked to do something outside of my comfort zone, like go on a sales call, can I do it? Will I complain bitterly if asked to fix bugs for awhile? Will I skip off to a new job just as I start becoming productive at your company? Can I mentor junior people? Can I converse with the CEO and tell him difficult facts if necessary? Can others read my code, modify and extend it without undue problems? Can I untangle other people&#x27;s spaghetti code?<p>Measure that stuff, not whether I know if 0 == &#x27;false&#x27;.",1409163497

I have a high bar, yes, but I start off with the assumption that you can pass it, or I wouldn&#x27;t have brought you into my office to begin with.<p>It may be semantics, though. Your implicit understanding is that the glass is half empty, and mine is that the glass is half-full.

When I go audition for a role, I&#x27;m competing against other tall, dark, lean males that can appear anywhere between 25 and 45 years of age. Depending on the number of other actors auditioning, it may simply be a crap shoot. It may simply be that we were all good in our own way, and they just went with THAT guy because he was the last one in the room, or because he wore that one funny shirt that made him stand out just a bit more.<p>When you come in for an interview, you&#x27;re one of <i>dozens</i> of people we&#x27;ve phone screened, and you&#x27;re one of a <i>half-dozen</i> people that we bring into the office.

And if you <i>do</i> get the job, it may not necessarily mean that you&#x27;re the best -- just that you&#x27;re one of the best.<p>Kind of something to keep in mind here.<p>But again, at the end of the day, I&#x27;m rooting for you.

Thought it was a good idea to clarify what makes our project different from most other systems.<p>Even thought pre-commit is written in python we really don&#x27;t care about the language that was used to write the hook/linter. If there&#x27;s a good linter out there written in ruby, you should be able to use it and not have to install ruby/gems/etc. With pre-commit you just say you want scss-lint (<a href=""https://github.com/causes/scss-lint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/causes/scss-lint</a>) in your pre-commit config file and run pre-commit install. When you commit, pre-commit downloads, install scss-lint (without root) and runs the hook against the files you&#x27;ve changed.<p>Currently we support ruby, node and python and we definitely want to expand the system to support linters in other languages like Go, C/C++ and PHP.

AWS doesn&#x27;t charge for ingress,  but it does charge about 5 cents to move a GB out at high volumes,  and that can add up if a lot of stuff is being moved out.",1409162539

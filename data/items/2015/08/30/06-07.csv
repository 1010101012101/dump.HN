Time to upgrade to <i>ed</i>! ;-)<p>I wonder if kakoune[1] supports ligatures in a capabable terminal? I&#x27;m guessing not, but have yet to try.<p>Also, I just discovered that AbiWord actually have a setting to get vi(m) keybindings -- not that I&#x27;d suggest moving from vim to abiword for editing code...:<p><a href=""http://www.abisource.com/wiki/Keyboard_bindings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abisource.com/wiki/Keyboard_bindings</a><p>Based on the issue[2] for Emacs support, it looks like the general &quot;easy&quot; approach is monkey-patching from two-symbols to unicode ligatures and back on the fly. Such an approach would probably work with vim too -- it&#x27;d probably be just as well to handle that bit via a pre/post processor -- and just type in the combined symbols directly in vim (eg: iab >= ≥ to insert the symbol for &quot;greather-then&quot; rather than >= -- and then just deal with editing that as a single symbol. You&#x27;d need to run the source through a transformation to change all occurrences back -- for most langauges -- so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really a good idea. But seems simpler if you just want ligatures, and there&#x27;s a unicode glyph that matches the ligatures you want.<p>Ahem, well -- from the Haskling site: &quot;Some Haskellers have resorted to Unicode symbols (⇒, ← etc.), which are valid in the ghc. However they are one-character-wide and therefore eye-strainingly small. Furthermore, when displayed as substitutes to the underlying multi-character representation, as vim2hs does, the characters go out of alignment.&quot;<p>So then again, maybe not.

While doing the above, the trick is to gradually change habits. Instead of that cigarette, do Something else. Remember to be forgiving - one day messing up is simply one day messing up, tomorrow is a new day. Same for 10 days.<p>An additional suggestion is before or during the gradual cutdown on cigarettes, I suggest breaking smallish smoking habits as well. For example, waiting a little longer every day after meals and after waking (two major habit times), going one workbreak a day without a cigarette (I suggest reading or drinking liquid).<p>And keep in mind that part of the process is learning to be around others that smoke. Smoking can be a social activity and flavors your social life to a point.<p>Lastly, find something to help with the bits of enjoyment/relaxation the person loses through the day. This is, I think, the true reason an antidepressant helps some people quit. Perhaps developing a relaxation technique (used for anxiety or for things like meditation) would help, or having varied little daily rewards.<p>Good luck to them, for sure.",1440917502

10142475,comment,10140810,10142344,0,0,EdwardDiego,,,"> Polynesians are definitely not &quot;first South Americans&quot;<p>Who are you correcting? Certainly not me. I&#x27;m discussing which side of the Pacific drove the pre-Columbian contact. The obvious answer is the &quot;sea-faring people who colonised islands across the vast distances of the Pacific Ocean&quot;.<p>> &quot;The distance from Rapanui/Easter Island to Chile is less than the distance from the Marquesas Islands to Hawaii&quot;, true. But since Polynesians reached Easter Island only in the 1200s, their conjectured sweet potato journey must have been either post 1200s, or much longer than the journey from Easter Island.<p>They only <i>settled</i> Easter Island in the 1200s. There is ample evidence of Polynesian temporary occupation of otherwise uninhabited islands, such as Raoul Island in the Kermadecs, New Zealand&#x27;s sub-Antarctic islands (Campbell, Auckland in particular), and Norfolk Island. Polynesian colonisation was largely driven by population pressure, so it&#x27;s quite likely that they had discovered Easter Island long before they decided to colonise it.<p>> Super alternative conjecture, maybe some people during the glacial age, beneficiary of low ocean levels, brought it to the islands, and Polynesians picked it up from there?<p>Occam&#x27;s Razor definitely applies, especially when you&#x27;d have to drop the sea level by several <i>kilometres</i> to have a lower  ocean level make any difference to travel to Polynesia from America.

Reposting a comment I made recently:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>web chat is often (ab)used in a way that makes it the equivalent of global variables for communication: if offers the path of least resistance for sharing information (state) at the cost of making this information harder to retrieve, search, structure, associate, leverage in the future. Or to try another metaphor, it&#x27;s the equivalent of dumping data on flat free-text files instead of a relational database.<p>Web chat does away with two (at least) properties I have come to appreciate in written communication: being asynchronous and contextual. Although modern web chat systems typically work even when you&#x27;re offline by sending notifications, they&#x27;re primarily a realtime system. There is the implicit or explicit expectation that a chat message (especially a direct one) should be answered asap, unlike an email or a tracker comment. As for context, there is little to none. In more than one company I&#x27;ve seen chat effectively replace the dedicated bug/ticket tracker system, with people polluting one or more channels with intermixed discussions that would be better off as comments on the ticket at hand. It&#x27;s a mess for anything other than transient, throwaway stuff you wouldn&#x27;t mind purging after a few hours or days.<p>Looking forward for a &quot;web chat considered harmful&quot; blog post if there hasn&#x27;t been one already.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;",1440914716

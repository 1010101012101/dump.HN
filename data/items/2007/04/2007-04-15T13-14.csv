Or, do you really know how things are inside Microsoft now?<p>And, btw, I'm pretty much in the younger half of the population(16), and I'd much rather work at Microsoft which allows you to blog and conducts events in countries outside the US than at Google where you aren't even allowed to say what the dominant color in the data center is...<p>P.S. You rock, but this one made me LMAO. Tell me it was a late April Fool's joke.

It was probably the motivation for him adding special files to awk, e.g. ""/inet/tcp/0/localhost/17921"".<p>$ nc -l -p 17921 &<p>[1] 31333<p>$ date | awk '{print NR, NF [greater than sign]""/inet/tcp/0/localhost/17921""}'<p>1 4<p>[1]+  Done                    nc -l -p 17921<p>$<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawkinet/gawkinet.html"">http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawkinet/gawkinet.html</a> has more examples.  Perhaps there's a FUSE module which gives us a network sockets filesystem?<p>Cheers, Ralph.<p>P.S.  It's annoying that posters should waste their time probing the mark-up's flaws.  Is there a description of it anywhere, e.g. what characters vanish, or how to break lines?",1176642162

The amount of signal loss through a barrier increases with frequency, so 2.4GHz signals die out more quickly than, say 700MHz. To be a bit anthropomorphic, radio waves don't see the thickness of an obstacle in terms of inches or meters, they see them in terms of wavelengths, which are inversely proportional to frequency. So opening up high power, low(er) frequency wireless equipment to everyone would most likely be a disaster.<p>On the other hand, the current practice of just handing over chunks of scarce resources to anti-competitive firms _is_ broken, so the author is correct that change would be beneficial.",1250699206

The key part of this is in politics, if a politician promises something <i>they have to deliver it</i> or it becomes a breach of an agreement, just like a breach of an implied contract.<p>Another example is the use of welfare. Under social justice theory, it's perfectly acceptable for no welfare system to be in place, it would however be completely illegal to prevent a person or group from access to what hospital/unemployment services are available, even if it's just insurance. Basically it would make <i>everyone</i> insurable, there would be no ability to deny insurance, but the cost is still free to fluctuate <i>before</i> you get the contract. There would be no denying people care with insurance.<p>In countries with welfare systems, it would reinforce access to them. I know in France they have a welfare system, yet in some areas people can't get easy access to medical care; I know in one area it can supposedly take over an hour to get to the nearest emergency room, over two hours if you call an ambulance. The French take this as unnacceptable already, which is right in line with Social Justice, and right now they've got a conservative in power.<p>The benefits of society are not cold hard cash, they're whatever benefits are available from society. If you're not a communist country, getting cash handed to you isn't a benefit of society, however in the west access to certain services is seen as a benefit of society. Impartial means non-prejudice, so you can't be denied access to one of these benefits on account of race or religion or such; no stupid no-fly lists as air-travel is expected in the west.<p>Justice is just, and believing life should be fair and just everywhere isn't a leftist theory as it's implemented in both political sides of the argument.<p>The shame about social justice is that now when it's discussed people want money hand-outs. What really should be discussed in Social Justice isn't all the rewards, but the punishments. Anti-social behaviours that harm other peoples social entitlements are supposed to be harshly punishable; trespassing, noise pollution and such, that are rarely handled by police until it's a big deal.<p>The biggest shame of social justice, however is that it believes set things are right and wrong. Short-shorts weren't always acceptable, so if we embraced social justice 60 years ago, would people be allowed to wear them? Should women be allowed tattoos, because they were originally '<i>just for men</i>'.<p>This is where their philosophy falls through. Morals <i>are</i> relative in our society, they don't have to be but we chose them to be, which our government and police right now allows certain laws to be disregarded as they become more irrelevant, like public decency laws (now uncovering the nipples, labia majora or anus are the only violations for women, on non-nude beaches), but certain places enforce their own clothing rules (no shirt, no shoes, no shopping) where there are publicly acceptable low decency expectations (beach fronts).<p>Either way, I generally agree, social justice is a stupid impractical philosophy.",1250699012

Of course in C++ there is a possibility to use it as a ""C with some more stuff"" language, and unfortunately it is used as such regularly. But well designed C++ code involves object usage quite similar to Java/C#. Also in C++, RAII is used for managing transient resources, and this probably introduce extra objects which in Java would not be created.<p>For example: Creating a temporary file and after some work deleting it would be done using try & finally sections in idiomatic Java, but in C++ an object would be used where the constructor contains the file creation and the destructor contains the deletion. This way the file lifetime is tied strictly to the object lifetime, which would be destroyed automatically when the code block is left.<p>However, the fact that object allocation on the heap is slow is mitigated by having the ability to create objects on the stack, which is probably even faster than Java or C#. And they are also managed automatically, so stack objects are always preferred if they are suitable.<p>While I think it is an apple-to-apple comparison, it is a microbenchmark, and as such probably irrelevant in most of the real-world cases.",1250698674

If it's administrative software, go to the dean of admissions or matriculation.<p>2. Often times, approval hoops will vary based on the price of what you're selling. Smaller accounts can be approved at the college/department level. Larger stuff may have to be approved by the board. Even larger items may have to go all the way to the district (even if its a 1-school district).<p>3. Get ready for a painfully slow sales cycle. You're essentially working with a government entity. The person who actually wants your goods has to submit a purchase request to their higher ups. If approved, that gets turned into a purchase order (PO) by accounting. You often have to treat the PO like cash as many colleges aren't going to even look at your invoice until your product is delivered and installed. \nThere's probably a 20% chance that someone along the way will be on vacation or off for the quarter ... a document always sits on someone's desk for a week waiting for a signature.<p>Here's some bonus, inside baseball tips ... free to you!<p>4. Go after community colleges. There are over 100 of them in California alone. Granted, CA's economy sucks right now, but they still buy stuff.<p>5. If you do your research, you can find the schools that received various state and federal grants. Some of these grants are HUGE ... as in ""how do we spend all this money?"" huge. If you've got something that could remotely help them meet their grant goals, go after them. Usually the college will setup small departments just for the grant and you can call and ask for them.<p>6. Hit up people (especially the grant people) in early June. Most schools end their fiscal year on June 30. You have to understand, if they have surplus cash in a budget somewhere, <i>they want to spend it</i>. When we did edu software, we literally had schools call us on June 20 and say ""We want your $8K product be we need it approved and delivered by the end of the month.

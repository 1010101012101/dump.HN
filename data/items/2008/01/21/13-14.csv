101541,comment,101297,101507,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"One thing I notice living here in France is that many business people seem to not actually want to do business.  Opening hours (with random closing) are just the start.<p>There are many businesses for whom the customer appears to be a nuisance.  In fact, businesses that work stand out like a sore thumb (for example, I've had nothing but great experiences with Darty and their after sales service).<p>My guess is that there are not more such businesses because French people (in general) don't actually expect good service, and hence they don't get it.   The one thing that makes US businesses actually work IMHO is that Americans are willing to complain about bad service.  In France, people will grumble, or they'll complain and the businessperson will insult them back.<p>It's all rather baffling.",1200922962
101540,comment,101297,101530,0,0,corentin,,,"> why are books cheaper in France [...]<p>I buy quite a lot of books, both in France and from other countries through amazon.{com,co.uk,ca} and I see no indication that books are any cheaper in France. The problem is that I don't buy the same kinds of books, so I don't have a good comparison point.\nI've searched for book price statistics in different countries but I wasn't able to find them.<p>But, since powerful distributors such as Amazon.fr negotiate big discounts with publishers anyway, I'd rather have a piece of the cake than letting Amazon take all the profit for itself. What's interesting is that the main competitor to Amazon.fr, the <i>french</i> company FNAC, offers free shipping as well but, for some reason, wasn't attacked :)",1200922788

101535,comment,101297,101511,0,0,ovi256,,,">I even remember having been taught, in biology classes in middle-school (something like 10 years ago), that AIDS was designed by the Pentagon or some other US agency to kill people in the third world (supposedly, for some imperialist or racist purpose). In history classes, I've been taught that the US basically went to WWII just to ""steal"" the world's gold reserves.<p>Oh please, get a grip on yourself. Can you half seriously suggest this was official curriculum? I can see some abysmal maverick teacher speaking about this, but he wouldn't last long.",1200921195

They will prepare and file fedaral and state tax forms and payments as well. That's a very good deal.<p>We use Quickbooks online (QBOE). Clunky interface. MSIE only. But it's a webapp (don't worry about backups).<p>We use PayPal for credit cards. They are not ""unprofessional"" and their API is simpler than any bank or merchant company that I know of.",1200920980

I have chosen this one, as it explains my feelings pretty well:<p>""The law they put in place may seem like protectionism (it probably is), but if you go to any French town you don't see their supermarkets or major chains taking over, there are always independently run shops. It's not like over here in the UK where you are pushed to work out which town you are actually in because all high streets look the same these days.<p>You have to ask yourself what you want, nice looking towns with interesting shops run by locals (as well as a few larger chains) that aren't being driven out of business by aggressive supermarkets and their internet equivalent; or, as in most UK towns: mobile shop, bank, mobile shop, discount shop, Next, shoe shop (schuh, natch), dixons, another bank, tesco metro, boots, Greggs, Pret a Manger, sainsbury's local, etc. etc. And a couple of massive out of town supermarkets.<p>The French made their decision, we made ours, or at least the supermarkets et al made it for us, I know which I'd rather have.""<p>Oh, by the way, why are books cheaper in France than in the land of the free (and of cutthroat competition) ?",1200920810

But layoffs often hit people who at least one other person you want to keep thought was good, which hits morale, which in turn also drags down people. Partly it's because the web of connections is complex, and there are lots of reasons one of the remaining employees might have respected the laid-off employee, any one of them enough to instill a bit of a grudge against your decision-making (or even incredulity that you fired the now-fired person before them).<p>In a way it's the worst with well-run teams that gel. The ideal situation is that everyone works out what they're good at and develop a bit of a rapport. But then if you fire one of the team members, everyone else on the team has a quite first-hand reason to believe the now-fired person was valuable.",1360799962

But arguing against it by calling it calling it by the name of another thing entirely - without bothering to establish a coherent connection between the two - doesn't constitute a valid argument in the slightest.<p>Further, my previous comment involved nothing resembling a strawman at all; you offered the position that copyright ought to be protected in order to ensure that the time and labor input into the initial design of a creative work would always yield a return for the creator, and I replied by pointing out that these are capital expenditures, to which no one in any field is entitled a guaranteed return at all.<p>Do you seriously regard as a strawman my classification of the advance investments necessary to open a factory and the advance investments necessary to produce a film both as capital expenditures, but simultaneously claim that your equivocation of copyright infringement with stealing is a robust and substantive assertion?<p>> I see no such distinction from a layman's moral standpoint<p>Then why do so many ""laymen"" actively assert this distinction?<p>Again, I have to point out that your methods of discourse actively <i>reduce</i> the credibility of your position.",1360799865

Afterward, even then it saw a unprecedented rise in women in the 80s only to be followed by a sharp decline while every other math/science field had continued to rise: <a href=""http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/spring07a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/spring07a.pdf</a> You may fault the following as this is purely rhetorical albeit reasonable, but I find it difficult to believe that thousands of women who would have potentially studied the field suddenly decided upon a generational line that CS is an uninteresting pursuit. I align myself with Sapna Cheryan's conclusions of the stereotype threat in computer science as an explanation.<p>> I've also yet to come across a single, official complaint of sexism in the workplace within the tech industry.<p>I've come across many.

Some of them are paying good money for the service. Given the amount of scrutiny under which they operate, what is the incentive for them to turn an algorithm into a less effective one and still charge the same amount of money in a growing ""cloud economy"" where companies providing the same kind of service are a dime a dozen (AWS, Linode, Engine Yard, etc)?<p>How does that benefit their business if ""calling their BS"" is as easy as firing Apache Benchmark, collecting results, drawing a few charts and flat out ""prove"" that they're lying about the service they provide??<p>I mean, I doubt Heroku is that stupid, they know how their audience doesn't give them much room for mistakes.

I also think that it's a good example of how some things?  you can skimp on, while other things?  not so much.   I mean, if the airlines show that you can eliminate (or charge extra for) in-flight meals without disturbing anyone too much.   You can even pack 'em in tighter (though, some people will pay extra for a little room.)   -  but yeah, you've still gotta keep the planes in the air.<p>Another interesting bit is that I'm not sure that it'd be cheaper to maintain airplanes to a lower standard, even without the customer backlash.<p>That's the thing;  sometimes, the cheaper part is just as good-   (for example, I think going supermicro is just as good as going dell, assuming the person assembling uses ESD protection.)   - but other things?  non-ecc ram, for instance, in my unscientific opinion, usually ends up being more expensive in terms of downtime and technician hours than ecc ram.<p>Of course, airlines are also almost all unionized; The hosting market is almost the opposite.  Generally more is expected for less pay in the hosting market than of the same technical roles in other sectors.  Traditionally, this means that many people start in the hosting market, then move up (certainly in terms of pay)  into a corporate networking or corporate sysadmin role.",1360799678

I try and convince him to put up text or even RTF versions, and I get back a response about legal analysis and legal representation. And that's how our conversation ended. This last conversation ended only slightly worse.<p>2. It appears he doesn't like my choice of language, or my form. Understandable, but all the words I have chosen are in the dictionary, and they are not in the dictionary because the Queen of England wanted them to be. They have function and purpose, and I believe their usage is valid to show extreme displeasure (towards a government institution and its directors) on an extremely important issue.

5216553,comment,5215884,5215884,46,0,nthj,,,"I'm inclined to wait until Heroku weighs in to render judgement. Specifically, because their argument depends on this premise:<p>> But elsewhere in their current docs, they make the same old statement loud and clear: \n> The heroku.com stack only supports single threaded requests. Even if your applicaExplaintion were to fork and support handling multiple requests at once, the routing mesh will never serve more than a single request to a dyno at a time.<p>They pull this from Heroku's documentation on the Bamboo stack [1], but then extrapolate and say it also applies to Heroku's Cedar stack.<p>However, I don't believe this to be true. Recently, I wrote a brief tutorial on implementing Google Apps' openID into your Rails app.<p>The underlying problem with doing so on a free (single-dyno) Heroku app is that while your app makes an authentication request to Google, Google turns around and makes a ""oh hey"" request to your app. With a single-concurrency system, Google your app times out waiting for Google to get back to you and Google won't get back to you until your app gets back to you so hey deadlock.<p>However, there is a work-around on the Cedar stack: configure the unicorn server to supply 4 or so worker processes for your web server, and the Heroku routing mesh appropriately routes multiple concurrent requests to Unicorn/my app. This immediately fixed my deadlock problem. I have code and more details in a blog post I wrote recently. [2]<p>This seems to be confirmed by Heroku's documentation on dynos [3]: \n> Multi-threaded or event-driven environments like Java, Unicorn, and Node.js can handle many concurrent requests. Load testing these applications is the only realistic way to determine request throughput.<p>I might be missing something really obvious here, but to summarize: their premise is that Heroku only supports single-threaded requests, which is true on the legacy Bamboo stack but I don't believe to be true on Cedar, which they consider their ""canonical"" stack and where I have been hosting Rails apps for quite a while.<p>[1] <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing-bamboo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing-bamboo</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.thirdprestige.com/posts/your-website-and-email-accounts-should-be-friends-part-ii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thirdprestige.com/posts/your-website-and-email-ac...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#dynos-and-requests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#dynos-and-reques...</a><p>[edit: formatting]",1360799349

5216533,comment,5213241,5216353,5,0,tolmasky,,,"No, trust me: I was on the original iPhone team and was responsible for Mobile Safari and ""WebKit"" on iOS, and you are pretty confused about the project.<p>For starters, ""WebKit"" is an overloaded term. There is ""WebKit"" the framework, which is a bridge between the actual gears (WebCore and JSCore) and applications. In other words, it is an API: an increasingly thin Obj-C layer on top of all the C++ that does the real work. Then there is the ""WebKit Project"", which is an umbrella term for all that stuff together (WebKit/WebCore/JSCore). Chrome for example neither uses WebKit proper if I recall correctly, nor the engine in JSCore (opting for v8 instead), and yet it is still considered a ""WebKit browser"". That's because what makes you ""behave"" like WebKit is WebCore, which actually handles DOM, rendering, CSS, etc etc. So saying that Apple releases WebKit for iOS is perfectly acceptable terminology, even if you are wanting to be pedantic about it. Now I don't know what you define as ""juicy functionality"", but I can assure you that WebCore is not just some helper library or something, WebCore more or less IS WebKit. It is certainly enough for you to be <i>able to</i> build your own custom browser for iOS. In fact, even if the iOS version was completely closed source, you could still take the desktop 100% open source WebKit and port it to the phone (just like Nokia and Google did for their phones).<p>So I guess I'm missing the relevancy of your point. If you just wanted to rant that Apple doesn't open source as much as it should, then I sympathize, but it really has nothing to do with the point I was making that due to the <i>separate</i> restrictive nature of the App Store policies, it doesn't matter if WebKit is or isn't open source because you aren't allowed to ship a custom browser engine anyways (at least not one that runs JavaScript).",1360799187

Firebase's use case is primarily for serving structured data (the type of data that lives in a database). For most apps, this is a small piece of overall data usage. Your site probably spends most of its bandwidth usage on downloading static content -- HTML, CSS, images, videos, etc -- which you don't need to store in Firebase (you can, but if you're looking for a cheap way to store big video Files, Firebase is not the answer).<p>Also keep in mind that for most apps, 90%+ of infrastructure costs come from running servers, not bandwidth. So while we may seem more expensive than other services, we eliminate your costs for servers and  backups. The <i>only</i> thing you pay is the per-bandwidth/storage price. Also keep in mind that Firebase apps can often use less data per-user than traditional apps, since they push data only when it changes, rather than polling.<p>The vast majority of the apps on Firebase today will fit nicely in our free plan.",1360797811

No mystical ""calibration scores"" or HR indirections. He gets up and says, ""This is what I did, and here's why I had to do it.""

5216308,comment,5213338,5215306,1,0,wilkie,,,"> My kids are growing up in a bubble that I did not grow up in. There's something about this bubble that slaps erroneous labels on problems. Some of the problems aren't even problems.<p>That's how <i>you</i> see it. They don't have to, and probably won't, see things the same way. Some of their problems might not be problems to <i>you</i>.<p>> But before I can do that, I have to teach them how to walk away, because their natural inclination seems to be to engage.<p>Let them engage! Let them both observe and be heard. They are very capable of coming to a conclusion. Your only role should be to ensure that they are heard, visible, and safe. Why would you first teach them to walk away? Why teach them that this form of engagement is negative? Inaction is valid, true, but we should not be afraid to act or suggest that some forms of aggression or anger are invalid.<p>> Reducing what I was trying to express to ""ignore them and they will go away"" has put the ball in the bleachers.<p>I got this message from this statement you made:<p>> Rather I think of it as not letting other people's drama own any part of me. And that is what I think when anyone complains of anything, be it gender bias or racial bias or religious/political disagreement: nothing can own you unless you let it.<p>Seems like a valid conclusion to make on my part. Be made out of rubber as though you can just brush off all forms of oppression. But, regardless of being made of rubber, an anchor tied to the waist can still sink you, perhaps regardless of what you do. It requires a collective change to reverse... something I believe your children can inspire.<p>> We can't go through life saying, ""I'm not welcome here because of attributes that are beyond my control.""<p>I wonder, in hesitation, just which attributes you speak of. Regardless, maybe... just maybe... they <i>are</i> within our collective control. The more these types of articles come out, regardless of your feelings that they be suppressed due to their negativity, the more positive discussions like ours will play out in front of your children's generation.",1360796537

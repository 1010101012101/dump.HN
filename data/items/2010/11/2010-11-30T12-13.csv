When I suspected the people who say they've successfully done polyphasic sleep are just making up stories aloud in IRC, someone on the channel told me they'd done polyphasic sleep for several weeks.<p>I'd consider polyphasic sleep as working if after within two weeks of starting the schedule a significant number of people could start going instantly into REM sleep when they nap and could stay reasonably alert and functional with these naps for several weeks. This should be easy enough to test in a lab.<p>My guesses are that it can really work (but I'm not sure if it can work for most or for not that many people) and that it's likely to impair mental performance a bit even after successful adaptation. I haven't read many polyphasic sleep accounts from people involved in seriously brainpower and creativity intensive work like mathematics research. Also, I'm a bit wary of cutting away non-REM sleep, since it seems to be the time when the body heals best.

I'm pointing out that incentives are not set as well as they could be, without specifying in great detail how they should be set.<p>Formal end-of-term type grades do not <i>directly</i> serve the students.  They are used by others to rank the students and decide who among them are useful for a given purpose (jobs, college admissions).  Students are still going to want these so they can signal to employers that they are valuable.<p>The grades are incentives that the teacher can use to control students.  The intended use is of course to get them to learn the material.  One point of the article is that they are also easily used for other types of control. 
Because teachers are to some extent judged by how well their students do, there is often pressure for them to give better grades.  Occasionally there is some inflexible rubric of X% of each class must get grade Y.  There is no direct pressure that these grades should correspond at all to mastery of material.<p>Grades on e.g. homework assignments and quizzes can also serve to help the students (or their parents) gauge their progress and find weak areas so they can better learn the material.<p>Most schools in the U.S. make the final grades incorporate these earlier grades.  This means there is pressure on these grades as well making them less useful for the purpose of helping the student learn better.  This also means that they are useful for control, because students care about their final grades.<p>Suppose instead that the final grades were not at all set by teachers.  Imagine something like the AP tests.  Because the homework and quiz grades would not factor in, they are less useful as means of control, and theri only use is now monitoring and helping he student learn.  Because the testers are not teachers, there is much less incentive to score the students highly.  They can measure mastery with much less bias.",1291120731

In short, you need to answer this question quickly and accurately: what makes your browser 100x better than any other browser out there?  Currently, your ""discover, read, share"" sections are not compelling.  Your App Store description is a little better with your quick point form feature list.<p>2) Your integration of Social Bookmarking is very interesting.  I recently reviewed Delibar (<a href=""http://robisit.com/gl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robisit.com/gl</a>).  It is an app that saves bookmarks to Delicious or Pinboard.

I think that you should integrate every single bookmarking and sharing service into your browser somehow.  This is a powerful feature that is not currently being used in iOS apps properly.<p>3) I realize it's early - but listing real testimonials sells apps.  Plain and simple, quotes such as, ""I love this app, it changed my life"" help people spend $2 on an App.<p>Without downloading your browser and testing it, it looks like you have an interesting product.

The problem with unions and/or education is that we keep trying to make one-size-fits-all solutions, eventually treating our children (and teachers) like widgets in a factory. So the teachers and children have started acting like we've been treating them. Further nationalizing it isn't going to help any -- it'll just make matters worse.<p>Each student is a complicated problem on his or her own. That makes each class an even more complicated problem. We need to be able to give people the freedom and accountability to leverage local minima and maxima, not come up with imaginations of how various global solutions might work. School boards alone have too much concentrated power and make too many global rules. It just gets worse the higher up the chain you go. The way we got here was through a long string of really smart folks imagining what magic bullet might fix things for everybody -- it will not be the way we get out.<p>EDIT: Interesting trivia point: one of the big pushes for centralized education ""reform"" originally in the states was that in WWI the soldiers had a hard time working the artillery. It was thought that we had better start having national standards of education so that we could be assured future soldiers would be able to fight effectively. Seems like we will never escape well-meaning people using bad military analogies. La plus ca change...",1291119958

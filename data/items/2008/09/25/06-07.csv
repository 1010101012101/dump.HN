It's not Cornell, MIT, CMU, etc (Posterous favourite school..) but definitely top 10-20 depending on sub area.<p>I also like Colorado School of Mines (www.mines.edu), but not sure they're in Boulder.",1222325991

ShellShadow is not a replacement for screen and screen's ""collaboration"" features are secondary to the tool's original purpose.  \nThere are problems with using screen for collaboration...<p>...how does the ""other person"" access the screen?  You have to give them a id and password to the server, right?  and if you are doing SSH auth properly, you shouldn't allow password access, you should be using keys.  So you have to set up a public/private key pair for a temporary support technician if your server is secured properly, right?  Ok, now they can login without you, right?   How do you control this second user's interaction?  How do you audit what the support tech did and differentiate that I/O from what you did?<p>ok, lets assume you actually want to do the above.  Now, is this server accessible from where the support person is?  If your server is inside a corporate firewall, it isn't, right?  If you have SSHd locked down well, it shouldn't allows access from unknown IP addresses, so they won't be able to get into your shared ""screen"".<p>I could go on.  The bottom line is ""screen"" works fine for sharing your terminal session if both users have login access to the server and the shared interaction is highly trusted, informal, and you have the time/skills to administer this solution.<p>ShellShadow works with zero mods to the server and you do not have to give login credentials to the support tech.  With ShellShadow, we relay/collaborate from the terminal ""client"".  The terminal ""service"" (SSH, telnet, etc) is unaware of the interaction.<p>Watch the flash demo linked from the home page to see the distinction.  <a href=""http://shellshadow.com/flash_demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shellshadow.com/flash_demo</a>",1222325987

314590,comment,313482,314125,0,0,mark-t,,,"I think ideas like ""Oh, that guy was a genius. Normal people could never do that."" are fundamentally misguided. He worked tirelessly on mathematics, filling notebooks in his spare time for the pure joy of it. If you can find somebody else with that kind of devotion to mathematics who is hopelessly average at it, that would be something.<p>I mentioned Ramanujan because he's famous, and he obviously didn't get it from taking university classes. I used to do math competitions in high school, and I'd meet the best students in the state or country. You know what? All of us learned the same way Ramanujan did: we read number theory books for fun, continually asked questions that were interesting to us, and then worked on them until we answered them. Not a single person in the group learned by attending lectures or even through supervision by experts. It's just not how it happens. That's the point I was trying to make concisely before.",1222325553

314587,comment,313041,313041,0,0,FunGus,,,"WTF??? No one has stated the obvious yet, so here it goes...<p>You're telling me that you're 20, have essentially no disposabal cash, you're NOT currently in college, and you're wondering why it's so hard to connect with an attractive 18-24yo woman??? JEEEZ!<p>First of all, a guy your age shouldn't be trying to get into any sort of extended relationship in the first place. That's insane. This is the age you're supposed to enjoy the myriad delights of countless, nameless women. Already done that you say?? Keep doing it. TRUST ME.<p>Second, you can't get ""hurt"" after a single date unless she bluntly calls you a ""fucking idiot."" And then only if you're a pussy.<p>But let's say despite my first point you still insit on trying to find a girl with soul...<p>Buddy, it's time to grow the fuck up.<p>Your financial situation is completely unacceptable to women unless you're a student. You're not going to be able to land a quality woman based on your guitar playing and fun attitude alone. Those days are gone. Women in this demographic are getting MUCH better offers than what you've apparently got going. This demo happens to be in very high demand by guys twith a lot more going on than you do. And yeah, most of them are ""older.""<p>So, if you really want to pursue this, you're going to shuffle your priorities around and START MAKING SOME MONEY! Or hell, if you have it stashed away start spending some of it. And no, I'm not talking about buying better clothes or cologne (though that's not a bad idea!). Instead, I'm suggesting that you take whatever financial, physical or intellectual resources you have and make some BIG moves-in the stock market, technology, IP, start-up, whatever. Use the enormous energy of your youth to bust your ass 12 to 16 hours a day - or more. (It's nearly impossible to do it after you're 30.)<p>Then, as your future takes shape, and money and purpose start flooding in, finding a cool girl that wants to stick around will be EASY. In fact, if you execute the next 10 years of your life correctly, your ""problem"" with women will be of an entirely different kind.<p>And Jeez, one of your dates was kind enough to explain this right to your face: ""[money is] what I need right now.""<p>By the way, I hope you don't take this as a FLAME. I'm telling you this because I'm rooting for you. :-)",1222325286

I'm a nerd, I enjoying learning new languages and it would look great on a resume to have a few more under my belt.<p>But - I always come back to PHP (and the wonderful CodeIgniter framework) when I actually need to get something accomplished. I know it like the back of my hand and I don't care what any of you say about the other languages and frameworks - I could not develop my applications anywhere near as quickly as I could in PHP.<p>Yes, some of those frameworks are designed for rapid development - once you know the parent language! I say find a powerful framework for PHP designed for rapid development and stick with what you know. Play with Python and Ruby on your own time.",1222324481

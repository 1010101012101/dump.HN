You can't argue that anywhere you enjoy going in the online or physical world is determined by emotional responses.<p>Imagine when you got to a restaurant that has music annoying loud. You may still enjoy the dinner food, but you had a bad experience eating the good food because you were annoyed with the music. That scenario similar to this article. You could still enjoy the article content but you were annoyed because of the bad experience. And after so many of those bad experiences you may just think ""you know what, I'd rather eat somewhere not as good just because I won't be annoyed by loud music.""<p>If you don't think that small things like this (that can easily add up over time) do change how your viewers see your site/company (regardless of the content), then you need to think again.<p>However, I could be wrong.

Having each date/instant or extended type proclaim it is an #inst or #whatever means a single handler will ensure they all become proper types on the consumer side, with no knowledge of the application or document structure at all. And if no specific handler is installed, a generic handler can at least ensure that the value returned keeps track that the tagged element was tagged, and how, rather than just silently yielding a string with some encoded cruft in it.<p>The world you are describing is that 'context-sensitive' world mentioned in the edn rationale, where the consuming app must know that the cruft inside the dob: string inside a particular map in a particular context is actually a date or :id is a uuid or whatever, and also know how they represented. Ditto the lastEdited: field, startDate: and foo: fields etc. Are they all the same?

To me, it seems like this idea is where a lot of these dramas come from. People whose ""celebrity"" is overvalued, and people who pay way too much attention to these people. Coders are not rock stars. They're just not.

After all, who wants to pay full price for a product that continues to deliver ads to you? The tacit contract across the web is that <i>free == ad supported</i>, while <i>paid == no ads</i>.<p>However, I'm not so sure if the average consumer (the target audience for the Kindle) will even think twice about this. Consider cable TV; People happily pay for cable TV subscriptions which still include commercial ads. They (arguably) don't get in the way of the end-user experience, yet they subsidize the costs for TV programming. Likewise, the ads on the Kindle are limited to the lock screen and kept out of the way of the actual user experience.<p>Also note that Amazon has deliberately chosen to not offer a higher-priced version without ads. Without an option to pay more to remove ads, the consumer will never have to debate whether or not the annoyance of the ads is worth $30 dollars to them. Instead, the ads become a fact of life and are accepted without question by the end users. Even better, it widens the Kindle advertising demographic to include those with the most disposable income who would otherwise pay to remove the ads. Smart move.",1347025461

However a list of Drupal, ezPublish, phpBB etc is indeed quite a big shift that Symfony2 managed to pull off.<p>also Symfony2 has had 2 major websites in production for 2 years now and a stable release for over a year leading to 1600+ Bundles (of course I would assume 80% are of questionable quality). I am not aware of any major website today using ZF2 and the number of available Modules is much smaller.<p>the fact that Symnfony2 has a lot more contributors than ZF2 can also not be disputed.<p>the fact that the lead developer of ZF2 says that when creating their new Form API he didnt even look at the API already in Symfony2 also shows that they do in fact have a reinvent the wheel mentality.<p>that being said .. ZF2 does have some philosophical differences that might make it more viable for some users with specific preferences. f.e. ZF2 ships with autowiring and a view layer out of the box. these features require 3rd party Bundles for Symfony2.<p>so my point is .. if you really want to position ZF2 as an alternative to Symfony2 then please focus on what makes ZF2 unique. that would in fact be something productive. listing all the things ZF2 can also do is legitimate as well of course, but can hardly be used as criticism to someone talking about the advantages of Symfony2 unless you can illustrate that the bulk of all PHP frameworks out there provide these capabilities and characteristics.",1347024180

Usually the ""placebo effect"" is just the no-op effect of the body healing over time with the body's own healing mechanisms, and the ONLY reliable findings of placebo effects in human medicine, according to the sources I am citing here, are self-reported subjective symptoms like pain and discomfort, not physiologically verifiable improvement in disease states.<p>So let's not rush too fast to assume an explanation for a phenomenon until the phenomenon is better defined. The submitted article goes on to discuss some animal studies related to seasonal patterns of light and darkness. These studies are related to the idea that the immune system is costly to maintain, drawing on many physiological resources of the living organism. That's a reasonably important point and is indeed the subject of much ongoing research. But human beings, with their very complicated behavior patterns for adaptation to many environments, probably have a system for regulating immune response that is harder to observe. I note for the record and for your reading enjoyment that the recent book he Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life by Robert Trivers<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Folly-Fools-Deceit-Self-Deception/dp/0465027555"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Folly-Fools-Deceit-Self-Deception/...</a><p>includes a chapter, with some citations to scientific studies, about immune system interaction with the brain suggesting a theory of self-deception in the aid of bodily healing, on evolutionary grounds.

Your five button screen example speaks to that.  Why are there five buttons? Who decided that?<p>The reality is that it probably could have had the same functionality with 3 or 2 buttons and been easier to use but we always want to add more, not remove, ""stuff"". \nThe reality is that we create software for ourselves and then expect clients to ""get it"".  Dogfooding is great but it doesn't mean that its ""right"" for potential clients.  Just look at 37 Signals.  They hit the nail on the head, but I would consider them the exception.

He said that when he was in grad school, he'd wake up every morning at 4am, work without interruption until 8am, take a 1 hr nap until 9am, work until 5pm, stop work, and then sleep at 9pm.  He kept a strict diet of only eating green veggies and never eating meat (plus, he couldn't afford meat).<p>I've never had any discipline.  In college, I decided I'd finally get some discipline and I would do exactly what my dad did.  I woke up at 4am every morning, took a 1hr nap at 9am, worked until 5pm, went to bed at 9pm.  I wanted to be just like my hero.<p>In short, it was a total disaster.  I was tired constantly.  I slept in class all the time.  I performed decently in school, but I remember it as a pretty unpleasant time.  It was a pattern that was very hard to get to work inside of a college dorm where I also had a roommate sleeping in the same room.  I found myself always thinking, ""What would dad do?""  Not, ""What's right for me?""  I beat myself up a lot when I couldn't live up to the kind of man my dad is.<p>I gave up on the idea of discipline, and it's been great for me.  When I reflect on when I'm happy or unfulfilled with work, I don't think of it in terms of words like ""motivation"", ""discipline"", ""inspiration"", etc., because those words just express patterns and modes of approaching work that work/don't work for other people.  I think, ""Why am I tired?""  ""Why would I rather watch TV than work on my company?""  ""What are the short-term / long-term tradeoffs?""  etc",1347023168

Want a fresh todo list daily? Write down a few lines every morning, transferring from past list as needed. Want a historical record? Well, you just got that for free anyway. And so on.<p>A ""dumb"" todo list interface solves our workflow problems by abdicating the responsibility and making us ""implement"" the workflow manually and just provide support for implementing workflows. And so the need to complicate the UI in ways that will almost inevitably end up adding friction goes away.<p>Creating a mass market application with a sufficiently ""fluid"" workflow support to allow this in a ""smart"" todo list app without adding endless configuration screens is something that'd likely be incredibly hard.<p>For my part, I have my own heavily customized app that works for me.

MGP will convert existing/old movies into 3D Software Scene Format (3DSS) movies, allowing manipulations of original movies, including such changes as camera angles, script changes, mixing two or more movies together, generate  alternative endings, swap characters from different movies etc.",1334563871

2. Do any of the existing tools have a plug-in/extension framework. Surely there's a lot of mechanical code to leverage.
3. Probably look at what the other projects use... convention will help gain support others who already have experience with similar analysis packages.",1334563801

To do so, they should make G+ the identity/social graph platform on which third parties want to base their own services instead of FB connect. I'm sure they could do that, because Google can profit from people going around in the web, while FB needs to keep people as much as possible inside its walled garden.<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like G+ is moving towards that direction.",1334563724

I'm doing nothing wrong"") leads to verbal escalation/shouting, shouting yourself leads to handcuffs, resistance (even passive) to physical force or (according to media accounts) tasering.

(But did not successfully complete it). <p>Well, you need an environment - money, encouragement (advice, not flattery), and co-workers.<p>Only Google and MS or a University can provide these, it seems.<p>Perhaps that's why I cant get my act off the ground :)",1180540608

25434,comment,25410,25410,0,0,tyohn,,,"According to Techstars and Ycombinator; they pick startups because they like the founders not necessarily the business model but;  I've looked at some of the startups that have received funding and I know I'm not a zillionare but they seem to have very questionable income models.  If you take advertising out of the equation, I'd guess many of them don't have an income model.  <p>Here's my guess at the business model; get the mentors at Techstars or Ycombinator to help you develop your company. (i.e. get as many people using your site as possible, probably for free) Then since there really isn't a real revenue source, after you get a lot of eyeballs you sell the company to some larger company.  Wah La ~ Web 2.0<p>I don't want to sound like I am indorsing or rejecting anything I would just like to see more creative income models.\n",1180540310

It definately is the best of breed between excel and the calculator - i can see why it got funded.<p>Plenty of potential where people have to share calculations/revenue models etc. Can see plenty of use in the financial industries and also in startups.

25428,comment,25251,25251,0,0,edgeztv,,,"I had this exact idea for a startup about a year and a half ago!  I really gave it a lot of thought and tried to recruit my friends, but then I heard that Microsoft was doing it, and I (rightly) assumed Google would be too.  <p>Even if I had time, I probably wouldn't have done it either way due to the hundreds of thousands of dollars required to execute it well (360 degree cameras, trucks, drivers, fuel, etc).  I didn't know much about startups or investors back then.<p>But still, it's nice to think that I was able to look into the future back then!  I'm sure others shared this vision too - anyone know of startups that attempted to take this on?",1180538663
25427,comment,25089,25298,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"This is an important point.  Saying that someone can go and add this or that feature to a framework requires that they first have enough understanding to know where to begin.  In Rails, this can be less than obvious.<p>To say ""... extending Rails to do what you want is often much simpler than you think"" is disingenuous at best. \n",1180538390

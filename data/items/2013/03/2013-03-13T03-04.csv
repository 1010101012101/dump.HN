In my comfort zone, I feel (and therefore act) a lot more confident than when I'm in an unfamiliar situation. It can affect tone of voice, posture, body language, eye contact - all sorts of charismatic gestures.<p>I once walked past Bill Clinton having lunch in an NYC restaurant, and from 100 feet away I could almost feel the charismatic aura around him. It was impressive, and has stuck with me. But perhaps it was as related to the several hundred people around with their eyes glued to him, as it was to any charismatic qualities he may have been born with.",1363147033

Even in a small company, asking someone ""why are you leaving?"" isn't hard and doesn't require a tremendous amount of resources.<p>2) Following up from question 1: What do most people state as their reason for leaving?<p>I've never met an interviewer that could rattle off statistics like ""last year X% of resignations were attributed to issue Y"" - but I'd be seriously impressed by one that could. Retention of talent is a huge issue for employers right now, so if your interviewer is in management they should have at least a vague idea what the answer to this question is.<p>3) How would you describe your company's culture?<p>Every answer you get to this question will be biased. It's virtually impossible for anyone to objectively measure culture, and it's even harder to do from an insider's perspective. At best, you'll get an answer where you have to read between the lines. At worst, they'll totally bullshit you. If your bullshit detector is finely tuned, then this can be a very revealing question.

One, they do the editing, contracting that out to people you never talk to. Disagree with an edit? too bad. Two, they do layout and typesetting, but again, with little consultation or input from you. Don't like how they placed your examples or formatted your code? tough. Three, they do the small paperwork of obtaining an ISBN. Four, they contract with a printer, again without input from you; and as Few describes, if the quality of the paper, the print, or the binding displeases you, deal. Five, they list it on their website and fulfill orders as they come in from the web and from the wholesalers.<p>That's it; they don't do significant marketing for any but an expected blockbuster. Stephen King or Bill Gates they'd market. You? Nope. If you want your book marketed <i>YOU</i> have to do it, on your time and dime.

The CCA gives canonical the right to change the license at whim. To be honest, this is fear, uncertainty, and doubt. but no spreading necessary.
Canonical changed to a new, not well understood license, which gave them permission to change to other licenses.

It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and gave it the name ""prisoner's dilemma"" (Poundstone, 1992), presenting it as follows:<p>Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. If he testifies against his partner, he will go free while the partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. Oh, yes, there is a catch ... If both prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail.<p>In this classic version of the game, collaboration is dominated by betrayal; if the other prisoner chooses to stay silent, then betraying them gives a better reward (no sentence instead of one year), and if the other prisoner chooses to betray then betraying them also gives a better reward (two years instead of three). Because betrayal always rewards more than cooperation, all purely rational self-interested prisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them both to betray each other. The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads the prisoners to both betray, but they would get a better reward if they both cooperated. In reality, humans display a systematic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games, much more so than predicted by simple models of ""rational"" self-interested action.[1][2][3][4]",1363143728

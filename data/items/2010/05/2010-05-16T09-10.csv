Your tool is a tool for making tools, which is not what the average Mashable, RWW, or TechCrunch reader really cares about.  They want a shiny new service to show to their friends on their iPhone or something, not a tool that will help their company make money.  They don't even have companies, or websites to optimize.<p>That's your problem, I'd guess.  The group of people you'd appeal is too small.

The problem was not the mathematical models that were developed, the problem was that people don't know what risk means.  Traders have the ""it won't happen to me"" attitude, so they go for the big gains.  When everyone in the industry goes for the big gains, all paid for with credit from big gains that ""will eventually"" materialize, the industry has a problem.  (An example is credit default swaps.  If the bank that wrote you the swap fails, you have taken on more risk than you were expecting.  When a bunch of banks fail at once, then all the banks take on additional risk, and also fail.)<p>Anyway, this was all predicted, but the shareholders of financial institutions wanted the gains that necessitated heavy risk-taking.  And they reaped what they sowed.  You can't blame the quants for this one...",1274001891

I'm just don't think what he's advocating is realistic which unfortunately makes most of what he's saying irrelevant. You simply cannot avoid proprietary software anymore. It's a nearly impossible standard for even OSS developers & users to adhere to. Think about it. You can't drive an automobile. They all use proprietary software. You probably can't even ride a bike because the traffic signals are controlled by proprietary software. You can't own most major appliances. You can own <i>any</i> cellular phone regardless of the operating system it runs. I guess my point is by advocating this extreme approach Stallman is hurting the cause more than helping it at this point. A more realistic approach has some chance of actually connecting with a broader audience.",1274001850

I guess they're complex enough that there's huge ranges of stuff where we don't have good enough theoretical models, so only know what's been experimentally measured? In this case, it was surprising to me for some reason that it's unknown how dispersants will function at mile-deep water pressures; surely there's some sort of model for that? Or is it just that we're not confident in the model?<p>Vaguely related, I ran across recently that apparently scientists don't yet fully understand the effect that makes drinks like ouzo and absinthe get cloudy-white when you add water, due to some sort of stable oil/water emulsion being produced: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo_effect</a>",1274001363

Looks like the tablet market will be as competitive. So if we're not being forced into one platform and have the freedom to simply buy another product that suits our needs what's the real issue here? The post-PC era is going to be about making technology accessible to everyone. Is this bitterness maybe from the old guard who <i>likes</i> a world where they get to be the tech savvy computer genius their friends & family rely on? Or have they built their identity around being one of the privileged elite who are educated enough to do complex and interesting things with technology? Are they offended by the idea a company might choose not to design products specifically for their needs? There's definitely some deeper issues here. Also if Dylan was 20 today he would probably be more concerned about real world issues like climate change, human rights, the corporate take over of America, the ever growing inequality between the rich and poor, etc. I gotta believe his choice of which telephone to buy might be kinda far down the list of concerns.",1274001093

5889229,comment,5888398,5888398,11,0,sxp,,,"Disclaimer: I work for Google but the following is my personal opinion.<p>FWIW, the part about never deviating from the &quot;One True Way&quot; or the description of Google as &quot;a rigid environment with adherence to arbitrary guidelines&quot; is simply not true. One of the things that is brought up in the initial orientation is that Google is meant to be fault-tolerant and flexible across the board. From an engineering aspect this means that if a single server crashes due to bad code, the system should be flexible enough take steps to recover. From an employee aspect, if the employee isn&#x27;t happy with their job, they should be able to flexible enough to take steps to recover.<p>However, since Google doesn&#x27;t micromanage its employees, the employee might forget that this is an option and remain unhappy. In my case, I realized that I wasn&#x27;t happy with my position a few months after joining the company, remembered what I was told in orientation, talked to HR, and moved to a different position where I was much happier.<p>If I thought the rules were actually inflexible, then I would have stayed in my original position, got burned out, quit after a few months, and probably complained about the company to others. Google is flexible, but requires the person to actually take advantage of this flexibility.",1371405130

First of all, what I have read so far, we the &quot;public&quot; don&#x27;t know the capabilities of that agency, so by definition, you can&#x27;t know whether some technique will protect you.<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but a common sense tells me, that if they are able to monitor all Internet traffic, and also can run their own Tor nodes, and also possess software to analyze those big amounts of data that the monitoring will produce, I just can&#x27;t see how you cannot be ultimately tracked even on Tor.<p>As I see it, many of those defenses just assume that your adversary is not able to &quot;cache&quot; the whole Internet traffic, and that he also don&#x27;t have such a strong computer to crack PGP.

This is not an easy task, with each layer having the capability of being a highly specialized area of study. You can spend your life working in operating systems without ever really understanding what a compiler does, or work in compilers without ever actually understanding the digital logic that underlies computer architecture.<p>For students and hobbyists alike, the task of understanding what a computer fundamentally does can seem like a truly uphill battle. Approaching this battle from the top down can seem never ending. The number and complexity of layers between application code and executable binaries is daunting to the newcomer to say the least. Approaching it from the bottom up is still difficult, but it allows you to see the need for each abstraction layer as the shortcomings of a lower layer present themselves.<p>This book takes this bottom up approach to literally take you from digital logic to high level software, literally from nand to tetris. And while each layer in between is highly simplified, it allows you to understand a system as a whole rather than concentrating on the specific layers. Really, a great read. And the projects are priceless. If you make it through this book, you will understand how computers _fundamentally_ work.",1371404596

I understand that the judge decided to allow a reopening of certain aspects of the case v. IBM because he decided it was improperly closed.<p>But from what I understood, the decision v. Novell essentially stripped SCO of any claims of copyright to Unix. Now I know the IBM lawsuit revolved around some slightly different issues from the Novell one, but if SCO has no copyright claims, how is it even paying counsel to sue someone?<p>Is this just a leftover pile of money that&#x27;s literally doing nothing but funding a series of doomed lawsuits?<p>I understand from a strictly legal standpoint they are allowed to go on with certain claims but from a practical standpoint, I just don&#x27;t get it.

For example: &quot;The ARM collective simply show up to Samsung or TWSC, or TI or Global Foundries, ask for a zillion processors to run off the manufacturing lines and wonder if they can have them by Tuesday?&quot; which is just total bullshit. The reason Apple had to buy so many processors from Samsung for so long is because setting up a new processor is expensive and difficult, whether it&#x27;s an Intel or Global Foundries and it sure as hell doesn&#x27;t take less than six months, let alone a week before you can get a reliable shipment of chips for a consumer product. (and before you can talk about volume of ARM vs Intel, compare the dozen+ companies that can manufacture 24-60-something nm to the ONE company that can do 22 and lower: Intel)<p>There are many competitors in the semiconductor manufacturing space because COMBINED they don&#x27;t have the manufacturing or scientific resources of Intel (TI and Qualcomm have massive R&D arms but they&#x27;re more concerned with wireless and other electronics). Intel&#x27;s first mass market 14 nm facility is supposed to go live this year and Samsung just BARELY got their 14nm demo out this year. Intel&#x27;s plant was $5 billion and started in 2011 which means that Intel has years to improve their power, bus speeds, and reliability before any manufacturer will even be able to sell their first processor. As the technology nears sub-10nm, the gaps between performance and power consumption between the architectures will be more and more obvious.<p>All of the other semifab manufacturers are extremely reliant on third party suppliers for their factories whereas Intel helped develop a huge portion of their technology, many times outright owning part of the equipment manufacturers (for example, <a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/computing/132604-intel-invests-in-asml-to-boost-extreme-uv-lithography-massive-450mm-wafers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/computing/132604-intel-invests-in...</a>). 14nm was the point where they hit a lot of physical phenomena that prevent e-beam lithography and some of the other methods from working and Intel&#x27;s pretty much the only one that can really push this technology forward.<p>Edit: Also, <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-processor-5nm,17578.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-processor-5nm,175...</a> - it&#x27;s over.

And, unlike you, I&#x27;m not cherry picking my references.<p>What do I mean by cherry picking?  Let&#x27;s take your Wikipedia link, one sentence before the travel and leisure survey.  <i>New York City accounts for only 1% of United States greenhouse gas emissions while housing 2.7% of its population.</i><p>This is all consistent with what I said.  NYC has a ton of people.  Having a ton of people, it is inevitably an environmental eyesore.  However, per person, it is environmentally better than the alternative.<p>Let&#x27;s look at your garbage claim.  NYC produces 12,000 tons per day of garbage.  NYC has about 8.3 million people.  That&#x27;s 2.89 pounds of garbage per person.  From <a href=""http://www.cleanair.org/Waste/wasteFacts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleanair.org/Waste/wasteFacts.html</a> we see that the average American produces 4.5 pounds of garbage per day, of which 66.8% is sent to landfill.  That&#x27;s 3.01 pounds.  Again, per capita, NYC beats the rest of the USA.  Of course this is slightly unfair.  Again, as you note, NYC has mostly outsourced its manufacturing.  Manufacturing generates lots of garbage.  I don&#x27;t see an easy way to quantify that.  However I do note that NYC has a high density of very rich people whose consumption can be expected to be above average.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in the country.  Based on my experience, people who live in the country create tons of garbage, it is just not centralized.<p>It is true that Mexico city does better.  However Mexico city is also poorer.  Poor people, out of necessity, cannot consume much.<p>Next let&#x27;s move on to your points about raising water.  First of all, as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper#Environmental_impact"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper#Environmental_impac...</a> makes clear, it is true that it takes energy to put stuff high in the sky.  But there are tradeoffs and it is not at all clear whether a skyscraper is or is not environmentally efficient.<p>But that&#x27;s irrelevant.  The population density of NYC doesn&#x27;t require high skyscrapers.  I&#x27;ve lived there.  It is really dependent upon having small apartments, packed closely together.  Most of the city is made up of buildings that are 5 stories high.  (Because at 6 stories you need to install elevators.)<p>As for your general hate of cities, I submit that the facts don&#x27;t support it.  It is true that cities are unnatural, expensive things.  However, per capita, they tend be more efficient.  But fundamentally there is no way to support an unlimited number of people in a finite world.",1371403192

In fact, they were called that even in 2004.<p>><i>Hoover in particular had spent his entire life fighting communism and saw it as the greatest threat our country had ever faced.

Those ideas were spread in all government, not because of some irrational fear of communism, but because they wanted to protect their and their buddies interests.

The thing is, when you wear out an SSD, you get these enormous (multiple seconds) pauses that, if you&#x27;re doing anything I/O bound slow you down to a crawl. Even opening a heavy web page can trigger them. Buy a fast HDD if you want consistent long term behaviour with FDE.<p>The reason FDE breaks SSDs is that the implementation in LVM works at the block level. To send TRIM, the filesystem says &quot;this block is empty, tell the controller&quot; but depending on a thousand things, among which are cipher mode, cipher block size and other minutiae, LVM will invalidate the TRIM command. Without TRIM, SSDs deteriorate rather quickly.<p>Personally, I understand why FDE is needed but I&#x27;m of the opinion that selective encryption (with possible plausible deniability measures) is a much neater, if more difficult, approach.",1371402237

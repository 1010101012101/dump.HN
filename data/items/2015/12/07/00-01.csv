10687491,comment,10677693,10683611,0,0,tobbyb,,,"I think in discussions its useful to deal with defaults because there are always workarounds. For Docker the default is to run init less containers so you do not get a normal OS environment. For LXC the default is run init in the container so you get a container with a normal OS environment out of the box, more like a VM.<p>lxc-start by default will start the container&#x27;s init and any apps installed with services will start with container start. lxc-start has no options or documentation I have seen that enables users to launch as a single process without starting the container init so it will be useful to share how that works.<p>With Docker you launch the app in the container directly from the host and if the app is a daemon for instance Nginx, you need to disable daemon mode or it won&#x27;t work as there is no init process to manage background processes. So with Nginx you would need to disable daemon mode in nginx.conf or start it with &#x27;nginx -g &quot;Daemon off&quot;&#x27; in Docker. In contrast with LXC you install Nginx and it will work as it would on bare metal or VMs. There is no need to think about how the app manages its processes<p>To run multiple processes or daemons in Docker you need to use a shell script, or use a third party process manager like supervisord for instance. The entire Docker ecosystem, and tooling is built and defined around single process containers.<p>A ton of problems around deployments especially for multi process apps, daemons, databases or any apps that require cron, logging, agents etc emanate here. This becomes a process in itself to know how the apps operates and then to configure it accordingly. Your deployments also become docker specific, for instance Nginx with a Wordpress stack deployed on bare metal or VM can move seamlessly to an LXC container and vice versa because they all run normal OS environments.<p>This can&#x27;t happen with Docker and you need to re-engineer deployments. Why take on this extra load, and create incompatibility from a non standard OS environment, or worse give up the init that comes for free for for a third party process manager to do the exact same thing, only with more effort and cognitive load? This doesn&#x27;t make much sense unless there is an extremely clear upside and use case.",1449449920

If you want to hire a bus driver in Manhattan, that person is going to cost you a lot more than hiring a busdriver in Hicksville. Not because there is a difference in skill, but because you need to pay a premium to get access to people who can work in Manhattan.

It&#x27;s driven by who in the globe can do a particular job at a particular price, and there&#x27;s a wide variety in how much that translates to in &quot;goats&quot; for different developers.<p>Traditional remote jobs are still driven mostly by paying for a fixed amount of time working on the job per week. As such, they&#x27;re not hiring for a &quot;job to be done&quot;—they&#x27;re hiring you as an individual. To do that, they just need to pay more than the next best option, which is frequently determined by the local labor market.<p>Given that, option 1 makes a lot of sense, with the catch that you have to have a clear policy so it&#x27;s known ahead of time.

The company will not adjust the senior engineers salary until he puts up a fight and comes in with competing offers.<p>What this suggests is perhaps that the most effective and fair system is no system at all, one that remains dependent individual actors (or businesses) trying to get the best deal that they can for themselves. This is, in practice, what is happening now, but we wouldn&#x27;t have any expectation of every company trying to create some sort of formula to determine what is &quot;fair.&quot;<p>This means sometimes that you will be hurt by environmental factors (say you quit or get fired in a down market in your field), but other times you may cash in (maybe the senior guy at your company quits and you have the opportunity to leverage that into a much higher salary for doing his job).<p>Trying to make some master system that is &quot;fair&quot; and will work in all circumstances just seems silly. The market is perhaps a good arbiter of value on a broad scale over long time periods, but in more localized environments and shorter time spans, it is far more random. Thus, the best personal system in my mind is one in which we can take advantage of the randomness when possible, and learn to handle the inevitable downsides as well.",1449449466

That a Top 1% person in their field can only deliver $ 5303 worth of extra value to their company over their whole period of employment? I mean I&#x27;m no superstar, but that seemed pitifully low just from my own experience of the right action at the right time by the right person being able to secure deals worth a lot for the company.<p>As per the paper:<p>&quot;To generate a straightforward comparison of the value of each of these focuses, we quantify the value of a star performer by identifying the cost savings from her increased output level. That is, a superstar is a worker that adds so much value that without her a firm would have to hire additional workers (or pay for additional hours from existing workers) to achieve the same level of output as when they have that single superstar worker.&quot;<p>&quot;We calculate the percent in increased performance for each of these performance levels and multiply it by the average worker salary, based on company records.&quot;<p>&quot;For comparison, we report in the &quot;Avoid a Toxic Worker&quot; column the induced turnover cost of a toxic worker, based on company figures. Induced turnover cost captures the expense of replacing additional workers lost in response to the presence of a toxic worker on a team.&quot;<p>&quot;Top 1% Superstar: $ 5,303\nAvoid a toxic worker: $ 12,489&quot;<p>&quot;The data were obtained from a company that builds and deploys job-testing software to large employers. Many of these companies are business-process outsourcers (BPOs) that themselves provide a variety of business services (e.g., customer care, outbound sales, etc.) to their clients. The employees included in the dataset are all engaged in frontline service positions and paid on an hourly basis.&quot;<p>So these stats are coming from call center staff and telemarketing where there&#x27;s a lot more priority on people following the script/process than showing flashes of brilliance.

Those folks saying they are vegetarian because they think eating animals is somehow cruel or something are basically saying that if they can&#x27;t hear it scream, its suffering doesn&#x27;t count. We have scientific proof that plants &quot;scream&quot; (give off a pulse) when attacked and also communicate chemically with their neighbors when infested with insects, etc. So plants do have some kind of awareness of being physically assaulted and they communicate in some manner about this awareness, it is just a form of communication that human ears cannot detect. Saying &quot;if I cannot hear it scream, it is all okey dokey&quot; opens up all kinds of ugly questions (like &quot;Is it okay to be a serial killer if you are deaf?&quot;)<p>Anyway, some good arguments to get most of your calories from things lower on the food chain:<p>1) Ultimately, all calories start as sunlight. Eating lower on the food chain makes our resources go further because the higher up the food chain you go, the more sunlight is concentrated in those few calories.<p>2) Health. There are several metrics which are negatively impacted by eating higher on the food chain. Toxic chemicals that negatively impact human health tend to concentrate in the fats of animals. Eating vegetarian tends to reduce your exposure to a toxic world. You are also more likely to get serious diseases, like e. coli and certain parasitic infections, from meat than from plants. Most food poisoning comes from meat or dairy, not plants.<p>3) Cost. </i>Diet for a Small Planet* documented the fact that every country on the planet (at the time it was written) had the ability to produce enough food from traditional, mostly vegetarian, diets to feed all their people. Famine was due to political things, like civil war, and the fact that meat was too costly for poor families who had become accustomed to it and no longer ate the traditional, mostly vegetarian, local diet.<p>I am not a vegetarian. I am someone who eats more vegetarian meals than I did growing up and I have at times been accused of being a vegetarian by my meat-and-potatoes relatives. I also relatively rarely eat beef simply because I am really picky about the quality of my beef. I probably eat less meat on average than the typical American and I am satisfied with the healthfulness of my diet these days. I think a less-meat diet would do most American good. A meatless diet is not really critical and even the author of &quot;Diet for a Small Planet&quot; later relented on her vegetarian stance and repositioned it as &quot;One less hamburger&quot; in a follow-up book, indicating that we stretch the planets resources by reducing our excessive consumption of meat without giving it up entirely.",1449447322

Said client receives a separate capability to revoke the new wrapper, which it can exercise later. Or, the client might supply the object host with some other instructions on when revocation should occur.<p>Macaroons can probably be seen as an implementation of this.",1449446637

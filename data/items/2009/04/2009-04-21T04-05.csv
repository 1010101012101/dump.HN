571923,comment,571768,571768,0,0,brc,,,"I thought this was an entertaining piece, probably very familiar to many.<p>My maxim has always been : I don't to hire a financial advisor who I can actually afford.<p>You either need to educate yourself on what you're doing or stay out of the market.  I know a guy who is paid to give advice to retirees looking to buy funds by a main street bank: he's paid on commission and has very little idea about what is going on.  He dresses in a suit and sits in a little office and hands out shiny brochures, but as far as I can tell, he has less money than me, so there's no way I would ever take his advice.  Most of these people would warn against investing $5,000 in your brother's startup, but would happily recommend purchasing AIG stock, even now.<p>It's my take on the old 'I don't want to be a member of any club that will accept me as a member'",1240289092

Being free, we attract an inordinate number of scammers. I've been developing an arsenal of tools to help identify and track suspects in order to delete their accounts before they do too much damage. The most successful to date has used edit distance.<p>Scammers tend to post identical or slightly altered messages to a large number of users. As you might expect, this has the effect of quickly polluting the valid ecosystem. The solution I employed was to delay sending messages between users long enough to capture spammer patterns and compare the messages to one another.<p>I use the Levenshtein distance algorithm (which has O(n^2) performance). If I get a similarity over a certain threshold. I quarantine the message for further analysis. To work around the performance, I bound the problem by capping the number of messages used for analysis.<p>It has been incredibly effective.",1240288512

406136,comment,405680,406085,0,0,Retric,,,"It would be pointless for you to spend the next six weeks doing 3rd grade homework assignments.  Back in 9th grade my geometry teacher graded homework assignments which I never did.  The class was obvious and I got the highest grade on the midterm without studying or doing any homework.  But, I still got a B because he felt busywork was important.  Next year I had an English teacher who constantly gave out stupid vocabulary assignments to help our SAT scores.  She saw my perfect score on the verbal section of the PSAT's that year, but she still gave me zero's on those vocab assignments.<p>So I learned how important busy work was without actually doing it.  In life looking for ways to avoid busy work has helped my advance.  Teaching people that they need to waste their time stops being useful when you start measuring people on their performance not how they got there.  The real reason teachers grade easy assignments is to let people who work hard, but have no idea what there doing pass.<p>PS: IMO busywork is why few high school valedictorians do anything interesting or meaningful with their lives.  If doing well in high school correlated with doing well in life people might start caring about their performance.",1229925107

I would disagree with the article's assertion that Web 2.0 is about ""sharing"" rather than profiting off user generated content.<p>I'm hoping that Web 3.0 will be about openness.  The thing that bothers me most about the web is that everything is its own little sandbox.  Sure, there are small bits of openness, but companies are still using the data they have to (try to) lock people into their service.<p>With HTML 5 on the way, Google's native clinet, and potentially other technologies on the way there's a lot that could change.  Likewise, there's still a lot of things we all wish the web could do.  As such, there will be improvements and when those improvements get substantial enough they'll give it a name.",1229924778

Instead of focusing on the outcomes, I've been counting the pennies. It's tough when you're leaking your own money and that's before you've even launched anything! I think it is just something I need to adjust to - that in order to make money, one must first spend it.<p>I've also realised that marketing early is so important. I've been getting more active on Twitter lately and though I have a decent blog (been on Digg front page and Lifehacker), I haven't given it the love it deserve all year. I wish I had ramped these two promotion avenues up 6 months ago. This way I'd have a ready audience on launch day.<p>I thought I'd echo your reply for the other budding entrepreneurs out there.

The difference is that the straight-A students have learned to persevere through boredom, while the smart-but-underperforming students often haven't.

406111,comment,406010,406010,0,0,makecheck,,,"In some important cases, languages already have common syntax (such as mathematical operators, regular expressions, and string interpolation such as ""\n"").  And in those cases, the simplest explanation seems to be: ""there was no other sane way to do it"".<p>Some differences really are arbitrary, and could theoretically be merged.  Some are historical, e.g. someone worked on Unix for years and thinks in terms of verbs like ""echo"" because that's what shells used.<p>But usually, there are very good reasons for any differences.<p>One reason is the inherent complexity of a parser for a full programming language.  It turns out that it's fairly easy to confuse a parser, because they're just not as good as human beings at correctly interpreting the ""intent"" of a statement.  Most languages don't have a reason for being unless they introduce a bunch of unique constructs; and they're lucky if their own constructs can be parsed unambiguously, much less after adding support for extra ""standard"" constructs from other languages.<p>Yet another reason is that languages aren't as universal as you may think.  For example, what would 'print ""hello world""' mean in a makefile...when would the print-out occur?  Would languages be allowed to ignore ""standard"" expressions that they can't logically use, or be forced to invent some interpretation of them?<p>A final reason is what would happen when languages are embedded in each other, which is even summed up by your example, PHP.  If one language is embedded in another, it's a <i>plus</i> that they have different syntax: it clearly separates one from the other.  This reduces the risk that you'll have to (for instance) escape or namespace every single name used by the embedded code, to avoid collisions with the surrounding file.",1229922840

In my first year, I would avoid spending wherever possible and often made do with free tools rather than spend cash to buy a perfectly good commercial solution.  I quickly learned that's almost always stupid:  If you can make a problem disappear for good by buying the solution, reach into your wallet and pay the cash.<p>- You should be marketing before you've even started development.  Marketing isn't just advertising -- it's the social component of design.  Where you're 'making something people want', marketing identifies both the 'people' and the 'something' (that is, the market for your product).  If you don't have those, you'll end up with a spiffy 'make' that nobody wants.<p>Erik Sink provides a great summary of the topic under his ""Marketing for Geeks"" articles (at <a href=""http://www.ericsink.com/Marketing_for_Geeks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ericsink.com/Marketing_for_Geeks.html</a> ).

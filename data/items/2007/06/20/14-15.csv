Having just become rich tends to put you in a pretty cheerful mood, which makes all the everyday annoyances of working at a big co slide off you.  Plus Google is probably the most hacker-compatible of all big cos.",1182351191

29529,comment,29516,29522,0,0,wensing,,,"Good question, and one that we went over and tried to model based on things like Google trends and Alexa data for other storm sites.<p>In the end we found that what you are saying is true--the traffic is <i>extremely</i> spiky.  But what we also learned is that there are thousands of people that will traffic these sites all year long.  Not millions, but thousands, and if we can monetize those thousands through very appealing memberships and services, that'll be enough to make ends meet for both of us. :)  ",1182349250

29524,comment,29516,29517,0,0,npk,,,"Very pretty.  I'm not sure who your audience is, but assuming its goal is to reach the widest audience possible, here are my comments:<p>1) When looking at a storm, only information about that storm should be displayed.  When I looked at TS Barry, the bottom half of the site showed a ton of images.  I thought these images were of Barry, but they were of current weather.  Ultimately I found the site very cluttered.<p>2) If the target is a wide audience, it would be nice to have little snippets of text that give a simple interpretation of what you're seeing in images.  Like, this is an IR channel sensitive to water vapor.<p>3) RGB images need some explanation of what the RGB channels are.  The color contrast is terrible.  I suggest an arcsinh stretch which is linear at small values and logarithmic at high values.  I can give you more details if you like.<p>4) There's a yellow line that goes across the RGB images.  Is this the sunrise?<p>5) The main image window is awesome.  Is it really necessary to display all that other information in the bottom half?  Before I said the site is cluttered.  Actually, it's just that part below the main map.<p>6) On the topic of clutter, what's the point of all the buoy data?  I personally can not grok it.  Better to put it on the map somehow.<p>7) I love your use of sparklines in the windspeed.  It would be cool if you added a scale.  Is it possible to put a red dot on the sparkline to show exactly where you are?  I like the color hue change, but a red dot, I feel, would be better.<p>8) This is a cool site. If I hear about another hurricane, I'll definitely use this site.  Clearly this is a labor of love from people who love storms :)  ",1182348364

29521,comment,29307,29344,0,0,antirez,,,"Yeah, also it is not particularly cool after you sold that you need to go at Google to work on this stuff. I mean... ok... after some year the vesting period expires and you are rich and goodbye, but in some way after the acquisition you became a ""worker"" for Google with much less freedom than before: this sucks.",1182348206

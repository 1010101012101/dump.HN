And then sold it.  I'll never be an hourly consultant again, if I can swing it).",1185305236
36420,comment,36132,36221,0,0,Goladus,,,"Joel isn't an advocate of ""plan everything out on paper.""  It's more about discipline and attacking a problem as effectively as possible.<p>It's true that his advice does tend towards shrink-wrapped software, where it's not so easy to just go in and fix something after you've had real users testing it.  But what you describe is closer to what he'd call ""hallway usability testing.""  That doesn't rule out a spec as a valuable component of the development process.<p>Anyway, the test for the value of a spec really shouldn't be taken after just 4 months.<p>",1185305038

36418,comment,36365,36398,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"It's best to use either a constant simple log or an occasional detailed log: I occasionally note nearly everything I do during a single day, so I know how I use my time. But most days I use a brutally simple time-log: one sheet of paper, divided into two sides. One side gets a tick-mark every time I do something I'd normally procrastinate on; one side gets a mark every time I procrastinate instead.<p>That's as complicated as it needs to be (but I have a pretty simple job).",1185304768

36414,comment,36132,36210,0,0,brent,,,"You ARE getting trolled.  This guy managed the development of linebuzz.com (had you heard of it? I hadn't) and knocks advice from a previous program manager of excel (software that is on nearly every computer on the planet) and owner of a successful software company for the last several.  You may hate Microsoft's marketing, but the fact of the matter is that in the early 90's they had great software teams filled with world class programmers.  The linebuzz guy is knocking THEIR boss who led what is arguably one of Microsoft's best products.",1185304140

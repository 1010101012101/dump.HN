If we assume that after a period of adaption eating less is just as much of a joy as eating a bit too much from time to time, there are still other factors.<p>Most of them are a product of vanity, but they still shape our culture.<p>How would I look if I reduce calories? I would lose a substantial amount of muscle mass. I would be weaker. I could not recover from endurance and strength work as fast as I&#x27;m used to.<p>If we throw all reasonable studies into a bucket and have them guide our lives, what would happen?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be tan. I wouldn&#x27;t grow as large because small people supposedly live longer (though this is of course not something we can influence yet). I would have a very low muscle tonus as well as mass and only sufficient muscular endurance and size to do whatever I have to do (which is very little compared to a blacksmith in 1407). I would share a grey substance (heck, let&#x27;s keep the name soylent) with my date that has everything I need to live. I have no car to reduce my carbon footprint. I will avoid the sun in general due to my skin color which is very prone to cancer (thankfully my children will be genetically altered). I will gladly try to avoid talking about any of this because saying &quot;Don&#x27;t you think beeing vegan is awesome?&quot; will lead to an imaginary bullet flying in my general direction.<p>Let&#x27;s have a vote of how many women find this lifestyle that will carry me into my 100s so mind-boggling attractive while I&#x27;m still in my 20s.",1396658355

With our commission only model, we have an incentive to get your car sold. \nTrue store - one of our recent customers had her car listed at said consignment lot for 2 months with no action.

Nearly 100% of all retail order flow is sold to a wholesaler. Wholesalers like Knight, UBS, etc trade with that flow and provide payment to the broker to do so. Mom & Pop who submit an order from Fidelity or Ameritrade get amazing execution. If you read about and follow the current debate, you&#x27;ll find that no one is disputing this. What they are disputing is whether buy-side institutions (for example, Mutual Funds) acting indirectly on behalf of Mom & Pop are being disadvantaged. I argue that these institutions have a responsibility and the capability to select competent brokers to execute their large trades. They ARE professionals, after all. Lest you think ALL buy side firms dislike HFT I refer you to Vanguard&#x27;s comment letter to the SEC, which you can find here: <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-02-10/s70210-122.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-02-10/s70210-122.pdf</a> In it you&#x27;ll find a firm with about 2.5 trillion under management disagreeing to a large extent that HFT is bad. Finally, with respect to retail brokerages, you can read Charles Schwab perplexing condemnation of HFT here: <a href=""http://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-release/corporate-and-financial-news/schwab-statement-high-frequency-trading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-release/corporate-and...</a> This is from a firm that sells nearly all of its order flow to UBS for internalization within its dark pool by HFT and other firms. Go figure.<p>I recommend educating yourself on this debate. It is highly nuanced and very complex. The US equities markets have many facets that go well beyond the displayed market and HFT. The vast majority of professionals in this business would agree on 90% of the desired regulatory change: faster SIP and allowing locked markets are two large ones. You&#x27;ll also likely get a large consensus on eliminating all payment for order flow including rebates paid by lit venues as compensation for posting resting orders and absorbing adverse selection risk.<p>Take care.",1396657440

I spent a few years working in Capital Markets and those guys were hacking together their own DSLs in Java for foreign exchange trades, etc. Looked nothing like Java. Libraries like that are almost guaranteed to be written/rewritten in Scala as more banks adopt it. Grammar is as much a business domain concept than a programming language concept, so cool that Scala supports different lingos so well. Hopefully in the future we won&#x27;t see as many poor workarounds for language inflexibility, Ie, all the horrible duck programming done by IBM with WebSphere Commerce.<p>Grammar aside Walmart is a different beast than most apps. Handling huge spikes in traffic (Ie, Black Friday) was more a factor than new hires learning new grammar. We also had to handle massive amounts of data for catalog processing with Akka which wound up nearly being a DSL in itself. Pairing and a solid dev process is so important. That said if I worked on a different app with different reqs, less spikes in traffic, more developer turnover, etc, I may have used something else. Lots of factors to consider.<p>Grammar is definitely something to watch with open source Scala projects though. We&#x27;ll see if a more canonical lingo develops over time.",1396656136

8769311,comment,8768372,8768929,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I personally use Clicky Analytics which costs me like $12 a month. Gives me real time tracking, Twitter campaigns and a whole bunch of other stuff in a no nonsense interface that is easy to use. Of course, I don&#x27;t need detailed analytics nor need to action particular events like sales, etc (because I just track simple apps and blogs). Google Analytics falls into the same category as Clicky and other basic analytic platforms, they show you the views, but don&#x27;t really let you dig deep and query it.<p>I&#x27;ve always seen Mixpanel as a mixture between an analytics tool and a data analytics platform. Seeing the number of visitors is one thing, but being able to action specific events and drill down in the data is where a product like Mixpanel really pulls away from the pack. I like how Mixpanel allows you to query your data like you are querying a MySQL database.<p>A perfect use-case for something like Mixpanel is online media. Say for example you are Youtube. You don&#x27;t want to just know what videos the most popular or which videos make the most money, you want to know where the people are coming from and what is driving them to consume specific media. If 15% of your revenue is coming from say the top 5 Youtuber&#x27;s, you want to know how those Youtube channels are getting their traffic, is it subscriber count or something else? You want to ask questions like, &quot;Of the top five Youtube channels, how many of them received their views from Google Plus shares?&quot;",1418932572

The only wines tested were white...and white with food coloring. It is unfortunate that red wine wasn&#x27;t actually tested, as it would provide an interesting contrast, nor was taste actually tested at all. So as is all that you can go on is that given what appears to be a red wine, students who presumably have motives other than being entirely straightforward use red wine-type terminology.<p>It is an interesting study, but is not quite the trump card that so many think it is.<p>Further, it&#x27;s a little silly how people are taking products with minor taste differences (most beers, wines, ryes, etc, are made with almost identical processes, yielding close to identical results), and then presuming to claim that the same applies to things that are <i>dramatically</i> different.

The problem, as stated on the site, is this:<p><pre><code>  When it comes to &quot;what we are measuring&quot; the story becomes\n  more complicated because there is no real understanding of\n  the mechanism whereby an REG [Random event generator]’s \n  behavior can be altered by thoughts and emotions or \n  intentions.\n  [...]\n  We do not know how a mental state such as an intention or \n  emotion is able to inform the physical system to affect \n  its behavior. In addition, all of the robust measures we \n  have providing evidence for the anomalous effects are \n  statistical in nature, and the signal to noise ratio is \n  extremely low. This means that we typically cannot be \n  sure that the &quot;signature&quot; of an effect in any individual \n  analysis is driven by the hypothesized influence of \n  consciousness. The details written in the data from \n  single instances are more likely to be chance \n  fluctuations than consciousness effects. Only in larger \n  concatenations, gathering the weak signals from many \n  separate events, can we be satisfied that trends and \n  structure represent the hypothesized effect. \n</code></pre>\nIn short, they believe they have observed an inexplicable phenomenon -- intention influencing random number generation.

As was confirmed by the WWII draft, and I&#x27;ve read that was one of the inputs into the Truman school lunch law.<p>As an extreme example, see <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> where in 1942 the Supreme Court ruled the Federal government could prevent you from growing wheat on your own property for your own consumption.<p>Get back to the price supports, a big problem was an inability for all farmers/farms to make a living on what they could produce.  Specialization meant it was <i>much</i> harder to try to provide for yourself everything you needed, and people responded to these incentives and opportunities in more urban areas, real ones at least once WWII production got started and the draft drained the manpower pool.<p>And of course a large part of this was increased mechanization, which pretty much never stopped replacing farm labor with machines.  My parents are from farms and the Silent Generation, so they experienced the tail end of this.

8769186,comment,8768811,8768811,0,0,golgappi,,,"I understand citizens and residents of US have their own valid concerns regarding this issue. However, as a foreigner working on a  temporary visa who was denied an H1B in last year&#x27;s lottery, here&#x27;s an alternate point of view - Imagine being born and raised in a country that does not have adequate research areas in the the field you love - computer science. What do you do? You move to a place that better encourages your dreams. You know you cannot directly get a guaranteed job in US that supports research and the field of work you love, so you take a hefty loan and come for a graduate degree to US. You live hand-to-mouth (remember that it is infinitely tougher for people from poorer countries to get the total sum needed for a master or a PhD in US.), struggle through all the cultural barriers, loneliness and constantly battle feeling alienated, all to finally one day achieve the life you dreamed of - a job you are passionate about, and a life that respects you as a human being.<p>Fast forward to job hunting - unlike residents and citizens, you know you don&#x27;t have the luxury of &#x27;not having a job&#x27; for more than 2 months after completing your graduation - imagine the stress it puts on you. But you battle it out and land up in a company. If you are lucky, it so happens that you are doing what you love. But for a lot of foreigners, the deadline to have a job and stay here just so you can at the very least repay you loans in USD is far greater than the original dream they have, and so they accept whatever is offered.<p>Well, we say &quot;I&#x27;ve completed a graduate degree, taken up a job and now I have to repay my loan before I can continue with the American dream.&quot;  But then within a year you have yet another deadline - H1B. And unlike previous deadlines, this one is out of your hands - utterly and completely. You are a highly educated person working as a skilled worker in a respected position, and now your whole life is dependent only on one thing - a lottery. A random lottery will decide your fate. At that point it hits home - all your life you thought your hard work was an investment towards a better future, but now you know its no different than if you were buying lottery tickets for the past two decades.<p>Imagine the helplessness, the crushing sensation of all your dreams shattering. That&#x27;s what its like to have your whole life dependent on a lottery. Want to limit foreign workers? Make interviews tougher, change laws to reject the possibility of working after a graduate US degree. I mean it - do anything but please do not let our lives and fate be decided by a random lottery. It is humiliating.<p>P.S. What&#x27;s funny is to realize that unlike all other categories of immigrants, H1B skilled workers are here on their own merit. I am not married to someone with a green card and dependent on him. I am not here illegally after crossing borders at midnight. I am not here because I have a lot of family wealth. And yet, for a country that prides itself on hard work, it is somehow toughest for people in H1B category to get a visa. I cannot help but wonder if today I decide to get married to anyone with a permanent status here, I will immediately be out of this agony, and can choose to be totally dependent on another person&#x27;s income, contribute nothing to the economy, and easily get permanent residence. Can&#x27;t help but chuckle at the absurdity of laws.",1418931056

8769184,comment,8769014,8769014,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"Working Software had 8 to 12 employees during the three years I worked there during the early nineties.  When I hired on, we sold four retail products and one OEM codelibrary (OEM Spellswell) for sell to other developers.  By the time I left, we had nine retail products, three OEM libraries and an Open Source SDK that we gave away for free.<p>We worked closely with an Apple Developer Evangelist on that Open Source product, as the Word Services Apple Event Suite enabled word processors to communicate with our Spellswell spellchecker, so the word processor vendors didn&#x27;t have to license a speller, or deal with integrating one, and users got one common speller UI, one single dictionary.  The protocol was also open, in that we cooperated quite enthusiastically with all of our direct competitors.<p>One day the evangelist, Sue Layman, came to visit our office.  She had not realized how small we were.  She was quite envious at our very smallness, because we could &quot;move quickly&quot;, for example ship a new product in response to changing market conditions.<p>At Apple, one could never write any code that shipped to end-users without an ERS - an Engineering Requirements Study.  In general, ERSs were good things, in that they would explain the proposed design of the code, what it could do for the company and so on.<p>However, lots of people had to sign off on them before a project was authorized.<p>At Working Software, I once wrote a product called Toner Tuner.  All it did was make your hardcopies lighter - that is, an adjustable grey rather than black - so as to save money on toner or inkjet ink.<p>We did that by hanging the controls off the Mac OS print dialogs, as well as injecting extra data into the stream going to the printer.<p>One day I happened to point out to our President that I could, with very little work, build a &quot;watermarking&quot; program out of Toner Tuner&#x27;s codebase.  It needed different print dialog controls, and to inject different data into the print stream, but the hard part was getting any controls at all into the dialogs, as well as getting any data at all into the print jobs.<p>I discussed this with Dave for maybe five minutes, it took a few days to produce a beta (starting with Toner Tuner&#x27;s shipping code), we were able to charge quite a lot more money for Working Watermarker than for Toner Tuner, and it sold like hotcakes.<p>The total amount invested in paying me to write it, Dave to manage me, for our tech support and office staff to QA it - we didn&#x27;t have a dedicated QA team - to design and print the product box, floppy disk label and manual was quite a lot less than what Apple would have paid, just to have a bunch of engineers and managers attend the meetings where new ERSs were discussed.<p>Apple and I expect quite a few large companies do some really stupid things sometimes.  For example, while I was with WSI, Apple once dropped one million pieces of direct mail without testing anything at all.<p>When we dropped direct mail, we would start with a bunch of carefully controlled tests, where we would rent lists from other software publishers, trade magazines and the like, compose different offer letters, try out different text on the outside of the envelope, different prices for the product we were selling in the piece, even send the mail from different post offices.<p>It was only when we were dead certain we had a offer that would profit consistently, that we would roll out a large drop.  Even then we would do it in stages, starting at say 10,000 pieces, then 50,000.  Our very largest single drop was 250,000.  It profited handsomely.<p>Steve Jobs did a lot to restore Apple&#x27;s profitability, but I still see the company do really stupid things, like changing the UI of its software in ways that I cannot tolerate, while at the same time failing to fix quite serious bugs that I myself reported to them.",1418931043

Instead, I&#x27;m confident that when you purchase those goods, even if directly from amazon and not one of the marketplace vendors, amazon will look to find the closest warehouse with such an item in it (even listed from one of the marketplace vendors) and send that to you.  Amazon also makes it quite difficult to just purchase directly from amazon and not from a marketplace vendor.

You can receive services without ever having an opportunity to know what those services are or how much they will cost. And that&#x27;s not restricted to high emergency care its everything. It&#x27;s not comparable to paying for services in other industries where pricing is presented up front or at least before services are rendered. The opaqueness leads to price inflation as well so service prices aren&#x27;t regulated by the consumer market.<p>For example once my wife had to go to the er and we&#x27;d taken great pains to know ahead of time what hospital was covered best under our insurance. Yet the bill contained test services performed in he hospital that were not covered because <i>a room</i> in the hospital was operated by a separate lab company that didn&#x27;t accept our insurance. There was literally no way for us as consumers to know that one type of blood test regularly covered by our insurance in a covered facility would go through the magic door into an uncovered facility. Price inflation and surprise bills are emergent properties of the system and that needs to change.<p>I am all for consumers having choice and taking personal responsibility for their care but our healthcare system makes that effectively impossible.",1418930606

Spectacle is manual window management and Amethyst is tiling window management.<p>Manual window management generally gives you better control and generally less overhead in terms of complexity. So it works well in the case of &quot;I want to be able to move this window to the upper half of the screen&quot;, &quot;I want to be able to make this window take up the entire screen&quot;, etc. You have to trade simplicity to get flexibility, though. What if I want to be able to move window to the upper right hand quarter of the screen? Or what if I want my screen divided into a grid of 3x4 and I want a window in the [0][1] position? You can accomplish all of those things, but you have to specify how to go about it, thus adding complexity. Slate, for example, puts that complexity upfront in writing a config file. Divvy, for example, puts that complexity at runtime.<p>Tiling window management gives you a more hands off approach. So things like &quot;I want all of my windows to be laid out in this orientation, but I don&#x27;t want to move them myself&quot;, &quot;I want all of my windows to be visible at any given time&quot;, etc. You don&#x27;t take actions to lay windows out, you just define algorithms for how they should be laid out and let the software sort them out. You have to trade simplicity to get control, though. Defining those algorithms can be complicated if you&#x27;re not doing something really straightforward, and if you&#x27;re not doing something straightforward it can sometimes be non-trivial to grok what&#x27;s actually going on. Or you end up doing a lot of runtime massaging to get things working the way you want.<p>To each their own, though. I prefer tiling window management, I have coworkers who prefer manual window management. They&#x27;re just different tools.",1418929824

8769025,comment,8767231,8767231,0,0,zeidrich,,,"Without abolishing VAT, what would be a way to ensure that it is properly collected by the buyer&#x27;s country without putting undue stress on small sellers?<p>One thing I can think of is that you could target the payment processors.  They already have personal data about the buyer, so they should know where they are located.  Most transactions are going to be done by a credit card processing company, or something like PayPal.  In either case, the EU could deal with those sorts of companies directly.<p>In that case, merchants could sell their goods without worrying about tax at all.  You buy something at a listed $100, you have 22% local tax, the credit card company charges the buyer $122, seller doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it.  Now, the seller could program some option that could estimate VAT based on geolocation with some disclaimer that the customer will be charged for VAT by the payment processor and are responsible for their own charges.  But that would be a courtesy of the seller, the buyer should be aware of their own VAT.<p>Some things are excluded from VAT, but they are the exception, and in that case, the seller could jump through some small hoops to register with the payment processors to allow those goods to exclude VAT.<p>There are still other methods of collecting payment, like bitcoin, like money orders, whatever.   In those cases, the law should require the buyer to self-assess.  In reality the self-assessment would be rarely followed, and honestly nobody would care if it were small purchases.  But the self-assessment rules would mean that anyone seriously gaming the system by avoiding compliant payment processing options could be punished, while still both avoiding an less enforceable situation like trying to punish a foreign company for failure to charge local tax, or limiting the payment options that foreign companies can provide.<p>This could also solve problems with collecting VAT purchases made from  foreign entities (instead of just companies from other EU states) and could even be extended further (You are a resident of Luxembourg, you travel and shop in France, you pay with a credit card, you are charged less VAT on the purchase rather than having to claim the difference when you return.)<p>In short, compel large payment processors to verify the home of buyers when the account is created, compel them to have some checks to avoid fraud.  Allow sellers to not charge VAT if the buyer is either using an approved payment processor, or if the buyer is from another country.  If you are accepting payment by cash or money order from someone local, then you must charge VAT at the local rate.  But if you are accepting a credit card through an approved processor, whether the buyer is local or  foreign, you charge the rate pre-tax, and the processor is required to A) add the appropriate VAT, and B) verify that the buyer is not lying about their home country.  If you accept a money order from a foreign country, you do not charge VAT, and the buyer self-assesses.<p>Alternatively, you could say that all purchases that do not go through an approved processor have the local VAT added to them, and the buyer is compelled to self-asses for the difference, it&#x27;s just a matter of how much you are willing to inconvenience non-EU foreign countries.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the seller should be required to ensure that the buyer abides by their local tax rules. I do think that&#x27;s a task that can be handled by large banks or payment processors.",1418929617

The claims of the author don&#x27;t really make sense:<p>> &quot;... columnarization, a technique from the database community for laying out structured records in a format that is more convenient for serialization than the records themselves.&quot;<p>Column stores in comparison to row stores don&#x27;t offer any serialization benefit per se. The main benefits are the following, I will be using a record (A,B,C,D,E) as example with all types u32 (4 bytes):<p>* If you only use some fields you have to load less data from memory/disk into the CPU cache and your working set is more probable to fit into cache. For example when filtering only the records where A=22 and B=45 you only have to actually load x<i>(sizeof(A)+sizeof(B)) = x</i>8 bytes instead of x<i>record_size=x</i>20. This can make a very significant difference.\n* When using compression to reduce the size of data, columns can often be compressed better because they only contain data of the same type and nature and thus probably share similarities. When using such a small record consisting only of integers it probably won&#x27;t make a difference. But if e.g. some fields are country abbreviations, textual description or others are ids, one could easily imagine that there are gains.<p>Coming back to the point about serialization, using the same technique as described in the blog post, there won&#x27;t[1] be a performance difference between column storage and row storage (e.g. using a struct). The method described in the blog post just lets the data array of the original vector be wrapped by a Vec<u8> without even moving the memory, so the method is independent of the data type that is stored in the vectors. Of course it will only work for data types that do not contains references, otherwise we could get illegal memory access after deserialization (which should be guaranteed by the rust type system because only Copy types are allowed).<p>The only thing this benchmark is testing is how fast a vector can be initialized.<p>[1] There can be an space improvement of keeping the data in a column layout compared to row layout when using normal structs. Normal structs normally align the total size to the size of the largest field in the struct. A struct containing i64 and i8 would contain 7 bytes of padding. In a column layout this overhead would be avoided. Still there would not be an improvement in this serialization scheme as it does not actually copy any data.",1418929578

That is, it both enabled and limited at the same time.<p>In a strictly technical sense, the US Army is prohibited from disarming citizens of Iraq in their own country, for instance.  But they might just do it anyway.  Because said foreigners would not be able to petition for relief anywhere else but in a US federal courts, and there are currently several barriers to them initiating an action there, which largely do not exist for citizens in the US, that foreigner is usually unable to exercise those rights using strictly peaceful means.<p>In short, it&#x27;s far easier to form your own militia and kill any agents of the US that you find in your own country.  That seems like bad policy all the way around.  It would be much better if the US just obeyed its own laws anywhere it goes in the world.  It might even be prudent to set up a 12th federal circuit, with at least one district in each country with which the US has an extradition treaty, to support cases with jurisdiction established by Article III, Section 2, Paragraph 1: &quot;<i>and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.</i>&quot;  Such courts would be authorized by the Constitution, but as far as I am aware, none exist.<p>If there were a foreign circuit, it is likely that Guantanamo Bay detainees could file Habeas Corpus motions in it.  Foreign banks could fight to restore their privacy safeguards while still serving US customers.  Private military contractors might face civil suits from the families of people randomly gunned down in the streets of their own cities.  If the US had to obey its own laws everywhere around the world, it would certainly devolve into pure chaos~",1418929463

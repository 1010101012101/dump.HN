I understand that it mainly talks about programmers and not computer scientists, but it's less and less true that programmers are not interested in what is happening in computer science research. Lisp invented a lot of the stuff that are now in almost every languages (conditionals, garbage collector, first class function, everything is an expression, recursion) and it took many years to arrive here. But nowadays I see a lot of interests from the programmer community for what is happening in the programming languages research around Haskell, Scala, OCaml, and even stuff like Coq, Isabelle ! In order to understand even a little what is actually going on with these research project one have to study (even if indirectly) mathematics.<p>Now that I have written this comment, I'm thinking that may be I have a skewed/distorded vision and that I'm not really talking about the same people as the article does.

Functional programming tutorials that teach you to write a recursive Fibonacci or factorial calculator are not doing so with the purpose of teaching a useful function, or even a workable one - in fact, more often than not this is called out by showing its performance for moderately large N. They only use those examples because they're simple, abstract problems that can be used to elegantly demonstrate recursion in a relatable way.<p>If we're going to talk about real world, practical applications, then it might be more relevant to bring up a problem for which there isn't a trivial O(1) solution. A dynamic programming problem, perhaps? It's glossed over with a terse dismissal:<p>> Advanced discussions might consider engineering considerations such as tail-call behavior, or the possibility of memoizing results.<p>... But this is exactly why a functional programming language might be better than an imperative for certain applied mathematics problems. Note, I'm not saying that it <i>is</i> better, just that it's not such a simple argument. With a different set of examples, this article could have been written in <i>favor</i> of Lisp just as easily.

While Henry Ford became incredibly wealthy by building the car and mechanising his production to a large extent, the rest of humanity saw huge increases in productivity by being able to drive around and use advanced logistics. Those advances ultimately enabled the next generation of workers to be a white collar workforce rather than a blue collar one.<p>This is symptomatic of living in a bubble. What percentage of the world's population drives around in cars? What percentage of the world's population is white collar?

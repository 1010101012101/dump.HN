6579629,comment,6579218,6579541,6,0,vidarh,,,"The chains are peculiar yes, but not <i>that</i> peculiar: It&#x27;s strongly ingrained in us to return favours, to the point that giving someone something is a brutally effective way of exploiting them by later asking for a bigger favour back (e.g. consider Hare Krishna, that tended to use flowers for this purpose). The effect is so strong that we often try to prevent receiving favours because we don&#x27;t want to become indebted.<p>In that light, these chains are easy to explain: People might like the idea, but people are also likely to want to prevent a feeling of being indebted - if you can&#x27;t pay back the person who did you the favour, paying it forward to the person is the next best thing. There&#x27;s also social pressure to show that you&#x27;re as charitable as the guy in front of you, and against being seen as the person who is either &quot;too greedy&quot; or too poor.<p>There&#x27;s also very low perceived cost: You were intending to pay for your meal anyway; that you&#x27;re actually paying for someone elses meal makes little difference for you - it&#x27;s more like friends that takes turn paying the bill when going out, where it is a social gesture rather than an attempt at charity.",1382270232

If it is impossible for your start-up to build such defences, you will become commoditised rather quickly, and therefore may not be a good investment, however good a project it might be in the first instance.<p>Building barriers to entry is a fundamental activity of the start-up that wants to succeed in the long term. Examples of barriers to entry includes: network effects, customer lock-in, stock, relationships with partners those are not necessary, and indeed often impossible, at the beginning of the life of the startup. However, if they cannot be engineered at some point later, the business is indefensible and therefore potentially a bad investment.<p>Successful businesses like Google, Facebook, or Apple, or Microsoft, may still be disrupted. However, because of the barriers to entry in their markets, these disruptions will happen over a period of years or decades, rather than over a month. That is one of the factors that makes them great investments.<p>When investors ask about barriers to entry, they are not asking what barriers to entry you have right now. Rather, they are asking what barriers to entry you will be able to build over the next few years, should you happen to be successful. And you better have an answer for that if you want their money.",1382268213

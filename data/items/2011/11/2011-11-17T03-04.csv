3246320,comment,3246081,3246081,11,0,famousactress,,,"I'm totally confused by the apparent consensus sentiment going around on this. I adore Instapaper. I think it's unbelievably well done, I use it, and I don't have plans to look elsewhere.. that said, I can't say I worry or get sad about people who develop competing products.<p>Seriously?<p>It's ridiculous to react that way. First of all, I find it patronizing. Marco's really fucking good at what he does. If it turns out that what he does is easy enough for someone else to swoop in and do better easily, then what he does isn't all that interesting. I doubt that's the case.<p>Second... fucking of course. This is how it works, and how it's supposed to work. We're all consumers first, producers second. As consumers we benefit from this mechanism CONSTANTLY, and the things we consume are directly responsible for making the things we produce possible. We all got Facebook from Myspace from Friendster... Look at your car, look at your appliances, look at anything in your life. The ability to completely rip off shit and do part of it a little better is where much more innovation comes from than individual giant Big  New Ideas. The folks that stay on top for prolonged periods of time are folks who capitalize on that are able to do that internally instead of resting on their laurels, and frankly Marco has proven that tendency as well.<p>[Edit] Sorry, further. The point isn't what Instapaper (as a product) is today, and this is exactly why small companies are great. It's what Marco is. When I go down the street and buy fresh pasta from the place that's been making it for longer than I've been alive, I'm not buying a product.. I'm investing in a relationship... A relationship that I can trust to deliver me compelling value on an ongoing basis. It's one thing to swoop in and build a product that looks very much like one that's on the market (only free, or whatever). That's not interesting to me. You haven't really accomplished anything valuable. In fact, it's easy to argue you've literally sucked value out of the world. It's another thing to replicate the ability to deserve people's trust that you'll continue to deliver value in new ways... even if  the original source for your inspiration is gone (and especially if you were to blame for it).<p>TL/DR: I ain't scurred.<p>[Edit] Downvote explanation anyone?",1321502119

3246286,comment,3245407,3246205,9,0,Retric,,,"I have often been complemented on how well I code, but I don't think I stand up to many peoples moderate questioning all that well.  I think this seems from looking for a clean solution to most problems vs. the perfect or most obvious solution.  The vast majority of the time I avoid dealing with the minutia that many people feel is necessary.<p>For example, I once had school project where we where supposed to implement some fairly simple math function in x86 assembler.  My first question in class was what instruction set could we use? (x86 Pentium I)  So we can use the floating point unit? (Yep)  So while everyone else was implementing floating point functions by hand I simply used the built in floating point unit.  I still remember handing in 4 pages of clean code and asked why this was a major project until people started asking for more time to fix their buggy 40+ page programs even though I had told several people what I thought was an easier solution.  I even told people that I finished the thing in a few hours while watching TV but they forged ahead I guess thought the sunk cost fallacy or something.  I mean sure the way you do arbitrary exponentiation is a little funky, but that's better than doing it by hand.<p>Oven and over I see the same things.  Last week someone was demoing his custom cashing solution created by hand and I was like A this does not fit our architecture and B why did you spend the time on this?  Sure it's 'fun' but why bother?<p>At the same time in interviews I have been asked minutia about the java object system etc, and all I can think of is if this matters your doing something horribly wrong.",1321500950

3246260,comment,3246092,3246092,10,0,_delirium,,,"How to tackle this well is a difficult question, so it's interesting to see someone trying. I think sex tends to fall along with personal finance into the category of things most people end up doing without learning anything about it first, or at least, not learning very well. About the most you can hope for in either case is a few don't-do-this rules of thumb being taught in school or via public-service ads, like ""use a condom"" and ""don't rack up huge credit-card debts"".<p>I assume it'd work differently for different students, but for a subject some people find awkward, non-classroom sources of information might also be useful to think about. The internet makes it so that few people are really strictly <i>unable</i> to access a huge range of information. But is the information out there good and well organized? Wikipedia, as often, is probably the least-bad high-profile thing out there, but I'm not sure that Wikipedia on sex-related topics is actually that helpful for a teenager; it somehow has an odd focus, half pop culture and half clinical.",1321500200

2. My argument does not only work for an immoral crime; it is merely illustrated by an example of a law people think is  not wrong.  Shoplifting is merely a counterexample to the logic ""If X is a law that a lot of people break then X is a bad law"".  I do not take this on to conclude that X is not a bad law which would be begging the question.
3. The original logic was begging the question, not I.  The statement ""If X is a law that a lot of people break then X is a bad law"" only holds if X is already a priori a bad law (and, even then, it requires a few more statements to actually work).",1321499060

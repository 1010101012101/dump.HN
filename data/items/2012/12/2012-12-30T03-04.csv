Everyone on it is just feeding off of each other. It's a perpetual pat on the back that makes you feel cozy that you have 300 friends and hides the fact it's making you socially inept. It's been 4 months and i never looked back. Even had 2 of my close friends follow my lead. Get away from this shit and get your social interactions back.",1356836734

Earlier this year some people expected Apple could be the first company to reach the market cap of $1.000.000.000. Right now they're under the $500.000.000 from $700.000.000 last september.",1356836644

Often these mistakes are what catalyze growth and create the scar tissue that helps them (and organizations) to not repeat the same classes of mistakes. You don't fire people when they make mistakes like these, you ask them what they will do to make sure that nobody in the organization is likely to make a similar one. Seems like that is generally Amazon's reaction too.<p>That said, I understand it's pretty damn frustrating having downtime during peak periods :)",1356836492

On the one hand, there is a big drive to move traditional desktop application functionality into the web browser (e.g. google and microsoft's office web apps, photo editing, and even some computation in the case of Wolfram Alpha.)  On the other hand, there is a big drive to push traditional internet content into standalone apps, as this author outlines.  Currently it seems that the vast majority of the apps in the Windows 8 store fall into this category.",1356836410

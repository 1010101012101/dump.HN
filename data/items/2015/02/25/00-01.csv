[1] We&#x27;re not just talking about your typical troll patent, but e.g. techniques for processing signals from MRI machines. We&#x27;re talking about the software behind self-driving cars.<p>I don&#x27;t get the &quot;that&#x27;s why&quot; at all. If you come up with new techniques for processing signals from MRI machines that it would be practical for a doctor to calculate by hand on paper then you can&#x27;t patent them but presumably the same people would still like to. The use of a computer isn&#x27;t <i>why</i> anyone would want to patent such things, it&#x27;s just a conceit to circumvent the unpatentability of math. Any sufficiently fast general purpose computer of any method of operation whatsoever could stand in as the &quot;hardware&quot; for any software patent, because you&#x27;re not patenting anything to do with the hardware.<p>It doesn&#x27;t do anything to say that math done by a computer should be patentable. If you can do math you can do it with a computer. What you&#x27;re really getting at is that you think some math should be patentable but not all math, without articulating any kind of reasoned dividing line between the two. Which is how we get here:<p>> Your right, this is a huge problem. It would be a lot better to have fewer, stronger patents with well-defined boundaries.<p>Certainly it would. But <i>how</i>?<p>The problem isn&#x27;t a regulatory one, it&#x27;s an economic one. Even if you exclude all of the existing software patents that should not have been issued because the claims are excessively broad or vague or claim material in the prior art, the remaining patents still don&#x27;t all have the same value, but there would still be so many that they couldn&#x27;t be accurately priced cost-effectively at scale. And having to pay a hundred times what a patent is worth because valuing it is too expensive has essentially the same consequences as having to pay for a patent that shouldn&#x27;t have been issued because invalidating it is too expensive. It provides the same incentive and ability to file low value/low quality patents and then use them to collect undue rents from everyone.<p>And even that&#x27;s assuming some hand wavy magic solution to eliminating all the improvidently granted software patents, which it isn&#x27;t at all clear how to do cost-effectively in practice.<p>The choice we seem to have is between no software patents and prolific low quality software patents. Given that choice I think no software patents wins.<p>> I think it&#x27;s underestimated how much we owe the open PC ecosystem to the fact that Microsoft could rely on strong copyright, enabling them to make money selling an OS.<p>Which is why software patents are unnecessary. You can do well enough with just copyright, not least because the cost of writing and testing software is generally much more expensive than coming up with the idea of what software to write. Copyright protects the thing that required most of the resources to create. Someone who wants to copy it has to duplicate all of that effort, which takes time and inhibits freeloading, and in the meantime the original creator enjoys first to market advantage and builds network effects.<p>Meanwhile someone who does copy the general idea is forced to present their own take on it, which in practice means making their own improvements and advancing the status quo. Android obviously copied much from the iPhone, but they also made improvements that Apple then copied back. Then Apple has to make further improvements of their own instead of resting on their laurels if they want to stay in the game. Copyright for software inhibits freeloading just enough without eliminating competition, so you get the best of both worlds, and hence the rapid rate of progress we&#x27;ve seen.<p>Having patents on top of copyright throws all of that out of balance. It gives too much advantage to incumbents and large entities. Just copyright and the network effects inherent to software have more than enough propensity to create monopolists as long as the monopolist doesn&#x27;t fall asleep and allow a new competitor to surpass them. Software patents allow the incumbents to prevent even that by maintaining a patent thicket around the market to wall out non-incumbent players.",1424824974

For user-friendly and secure communication software to be written in an open source environment, too many stars have to align.\n2) The market value of data: Software which can be monitored, and data of its users aggregated, analyzed, acted upon, and sold is more lucrative than making something which is truly secure, even from the authors.<p>I believe usable encryption is possible, but I don&#x27;t expect it to come from grassroots open source efforts, nor from the big market players.  If anyone, I expect to see it come a collaboration between large non-profits (such as Mozilla, EFF), and universities.

One day last year it would not turn on, and he and his labmates spent hours trying to diagnose the problem. Finally one of them, exasperated, put his elbow on top of the laser cabinet with a deep sigh, whereupon the laser promptly started working. Excited, they found a big piece of steel and duct-taped it to the top of the cabinet in that very place, with a big &quot;DO NOT MOVE&quot;-note, and the laser has been working fine ever since.",1424822551

You either have discrete containers that denote privacy relations between information and parties or you do not have it at all. Privacy does not exist on a gradient on a computer. You can not calculate the percentage of how private something is. If it is marked &#x27;private information&#x27; and that information is released to a party not under the user / group / role term that is supposed to have access to that category of information, then that information ceases to be private.",1424822548

So there is a comprehensive web of trust amongst them.<p>You can get the entire set of public keys from the &quot;debian-keyring&quot; package, assuming you trust your OS (and you use Debian or a derivative). And if you want to be signed into the strong set, find and ask a Debian developer (you probably have one reasonably local to you).",1424822514

The items will appear randomly based on the user&#x27;s location and will tell them exactly where it can be purchased from and if that item is available or not at that location.\nStatus: Not released, still under development. Demo can be found on the website. Currently in the process of partnering with retail brands.\nAny feedback on the idea and the website would be much appreciated.

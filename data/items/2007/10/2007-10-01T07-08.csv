Indeed they are taking risks here. The ones left behind are picking up a lot of slack. ",1191224032
61523,comment,61333,61516,0,0,rms,,,"At less than obscene resolutions, I greatly prefer monochrome fonts over smoothed fonts, which look blurry to me. Whenever I'm running at 200DPI, I'll switch to subpixel anti-aliased fonts.<p>Windows gives me the option of having incredibly readable subtly smoothed monochrome fonts and Linux only lets me have smoothed fonts. This is one area (the only area, I admit) where Linux is less configurable, or at least has less worthwhile options than Windows. But text readability seems like the single most important issue to me in an OS, so I have to stick with Windows until I find a Linux kernel recompiled for better monochrome fonts.<p>Or I need to download a pixel font for all the standard web and system fonts, but copyright makes that illegal and impossible.",1191224015
61522,comment,61222,61435,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Have you ever used a Prada? It's not nearly as cohesive an experience as the iPhone, and it's not easy to use. The screen is far too touch sensitive. My point is, the iPhone is the first practical touch device, and it's the phone that will mark a paradigm shift-- the Prada would never cause a change like that in the industry. LG is simply not a respectable company, especially in the US where they sell the crappiest phones on the market.<p><p>

61517,comment,61466,61497,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"It is understandable why you think that way, given Google's aggressive ventures into other areas such as mobile services. But I personally think they will bring good things for both users and startups. The reason being that Google is committed 100% to openness. I think their interest in the 700Mhz spectrum is an example of this commitment. The fact that they are willing to spend the money to purchase the spectrum and then build out an open access network for others to freely use (including potential competitors) makes me think very highly of them and their efforts.<p>As far as the Chinese censorship issue, that is a tricky situation. China is a gold mine of growth potential, which Google obviously has interests in tapping. They cannot risk losing access to that market over censorship issues. In a business sense, censorship seems justified to me given the situation. China is just that important.<p>Apple is the company who I worry will become too big and powerful. The difference between them and Google is that they are decidedly NOT in favor of open access. They are exactly the opposite from google, building walled gardens around their stuff to prevent competitors from sharing in their glory. The iPhone is a perfect example. As someone interested in wireless startups, I lose sleep over the Apple and their iPhone. Its hard to compete with Apple when they dont let anyone else in on that platform. I think there are a few things startups could do better than Apple on the iPhone, but as it stands right now this is a nut that just cant be cracked.  <p>

61515,comment,60184,61453,0,0,SwellJoe,,,">>> Say I have a lot of users and servers where authentication fails. I'd love to be able to pick a period (by dragging along a timeline of logs), zoom into to a period, and get any messages regarding LDAP from that time. Then I'd like to take that group of server and regenerate a certificate for each of them to fix the problem<p>>> I have no idea what you're talking about.<p>> It seems like you haven't used Splunk at all.<p>Hehehe...You misinterpret my remark.  I'm saying that what you're describing isn't our problem set with Virtualmin.  I'm saying I don't understand why you're talking about something completely outside of the problem domain Virtualmin sets out to solve as though we've failed in being unable to perform the tasks you describe.  I'm simply confused by all the smoke and waving hands.<p>> I know your a lot of your competitors (eg Plesk) are similarly basic. This doesn't mean that it wouldn't be good to innovate.<p>Here you're exhibiting a lack of knowledge about what we're building (you've already done that earlier by saying, ""Virtualmin doesn't really differ from Plesk in a significant way"", but I wasn't going to really argue that point), rather than pointing out why we're ""similarly basic"".  The problems you describe aren't the problems the vast majority of virtual hosting customers need or even want to solve.<p>Splunk seems like a wonderful product, and I'm glad you like it.  But it doesn't compete with Virtualmin.  It's not even in the same general area--there are some places where Virtualmin overlaps with products that aren't direct competitors (because we are innovating in far-reaching ways and stepping into a lot of different areas that effect hosting providers and their customers).<p>There's even more where Webmin overlaps, because Webmin covers a lot more ground, including system monitoring and alerts.  Splunk doesn't address any of the virtual hosting management problems our products set out to solve--that doesn't make Splunk ""similarly limited"" to other products that don't do what Virtualmin does.  If you don't need Virtualmin features, and you do need Splunk features, then by all means use Splunk.<p>> One doesn't have to build something to have an opinion on it. If you think otherwise, you may enjoy other forums more.<p>Certainly.  I'm just not sure you've really grasped who our customers are (hosting providers), and what they do with our products (enable their customers to build full-featured websites or applications quickly and without human support).  This awareness is a rather vital component in our decision making process.  ;-)<p>That said, we do have timeline features coming in a new analytics product that we're developing (and it shows up in a limited form in the system data analytics graphs provided by Virtualmin).  I'm not disagreeing that there are many areas for massive improvement in the analytics and reporting fields...there are.  It's barely been touched, even by the best products in the field.  But Virtualmin remains a virtual hosting management tool--not an analytics product.  It'll work seamlessly with these other products, but their job description is quite different, and their customer set will vary quite a bit.",1191222645

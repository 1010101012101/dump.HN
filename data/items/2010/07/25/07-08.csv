1545177,comment,1544581,1544609,0,0,gaius,,,"Here's the thing: no-one can <i>make</i> you be a manager. You might be aware of the downsides, sure, but managers aren't pressganged. So by and large, the people you find in management ranks are the people who wanted to be managers <i>and not programmers</i>. This is important because these people hold the budget and ultimately make hiring and firing decisions. Another factor is that angling for promotion is a full-time job in its own right. You can't do the maneuvering necessary <i>and</i> produce code. There just aren't enough hours in the day to schmooze at meetings and do work at a comparable rate to your peers who are mainly working.<p>A manager considers him or herself ""successful"" and looks back at their own career and doesn't see that they were perhaps a mediocre programmer themselves (or actually bad and given a promotion so they wouldn't be able to break stuff[1]). Then they look at a candidate who is still programming after 20 years and they see a ""failure"". That's why ageism is rife in the industry.<p>[1] It's very very difficult to fire someone these days. So you ""promote"" them sideways to get them out of the way. Problem is a couple of years later everyone has forgotten that, and their next promotion is a real one...",1280044754

AndEngine takes this a step further by running it on 2 threads and only locking them into sync during the geometry submission phase of the rendering pipeline. By doing this, you save about 10-12ms per frame to do your game logic while an eglBufferSwap is happening (on my Mytouch3g), which in some cases can cause a big speedup for your game.",1280043528

He was very funny and modest and self-deprecating, but it was obvious to everyone that he was really smart.  And his talk had some of the most quotable bits in the whole conference.<p>""I'm writing a recursive descent parser by hand because I keep it real.""  LOL<p>His listings of the things his language <i>couldn't</i> do were hilarious too.<p>In response to a question from the audience, he discussed how he designed a programming language for the first time, which was really edifying and an interesting discussion of the mental journey.  His answer was really good and I can't do it justice, but it talked about how he solved the problems by working in little stages.  He knew that he could break up a text file into tokens, and that's how he built a lexer.  Next, he realized that a parser was a lot like a lexer, and recognized groups of tokens, so he could build a parser.  So he then had a tree, and he found that he could walk that tree.  As he walked the tree, he realized he could emit bytecode.  It was a really good description, and better than any single lecture in an entire semester of my college Compiler Construction class.<p>The fact that the author didn't even know he was going to be able to speak until the day of the presentation, and came up with a very polished and professional and engaging presentation says volumes about his ability.  I think everyone really enjoyed his talk, and it really had a sense of joy and fun and discovery about it.  And it was funny as hell.

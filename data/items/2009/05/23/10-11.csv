There were 123 stores, all in New England and New York, so the mileage wouldn't have been that bad-- it seemed, at the time, like a good way to get on the Letterman show.<p>Thankfully, common sense intervened.",1243076308

Peace.<p>Also, the article vividly describes the moral dilemma common in corporate institutions of being forced to say or do one thing, while acting otherwise for survival.<p>Just one of the great passages in the article:<p>""I was actually told this by the trainer, Monica, as she stood before a whiteboard, diagramming an abstract. Monica seemed a perfectly sensible person and gave no outward signs of suffering delusions. She didn’t insist too much on what she was telling us, and it became clear she was in a position similar to that of a veteran Soviet bureaucrat who must work on two levels at once: reality and official ideology.""",1243073105

Is it worthwile to pay that expense? For some software, yes, for some software, no. The point is that there is no solid rule here that is true for <i>every</i> software project ( in this case, every Linux distribution).<p><i>""Since its first version, in 2003, Red Hat's Fedora Linux has been the best place to track what's on the leading edge of Linux and open source software.""  Jason Brooks, eweek.com</i><p>I personally would consider something like Arch Linux to be much more on the leading edge, and they would definitely not hesitate to improve their software at the expense of something possibly not working on somebody's system until they get the new update.<p>Case in point: Arch Linux was the first to switch to Python 3 from Python 2. A long time after that probably should have happened everywhere. And everybody whined a lot about how it was ""too soon"" and lots of software would break. Personally, I haven't had <i>any</i> problems with that transition on Arch Linux. Did it break things for some people, temporarily? Yes. Did it move forward the state of the Arch Linux operating system and, honestly, Python 3 adoption in general? Certainly yes.<p>If Linus had been on their forum yelling IT'S ALL ABOUT THE USER and telling people their attitude is stupid, maybe it wouldn't have happened. (Actually, he would have just gotten ostracized from the community.) In fact, they did get a huge amount of flak, but they stood up to it anyway.",1301273997

2376593,comment,2376431,2376431,59,0,tptacek,,,"I think it's important to know that, whether you agree with this deck that key continuity (""tofu/pop"") is a better approach than PKI or not, what we're talking about here is a misconfiguration of SSL caused by a political quandary, not a fundamental problem with SSL/HTTPS.<p>The fact is, if your browser trust roots contain only trustworthy CA's, and you look to make sure you're using a secure site when you expect to, SSL isn't broken. Those sound like two big ""ifs"", and they may be, but consider: they are both user interface issues:<p>* There is no collaborative interface for community-rating CA trustworthiness, or even a reasonable interface for pruning CA's out of your browser --- let alone ""do I trust certificates delegated from this CA, or just the CA itself"". We are still using an interface for this functionality designed in the mid-'90s.<p>* The ""first introduction"" problem that key continuity suffers from is, in the SSL case, caused by the fact that the SSL cues in the browser are subtle. But why should that be the case? Is there really no interface anyone can come up with that appropriately signals ""this page should be and is secured by SSL""? Because if you have that (or STS), sslstrip doesn't work.<p>Key continuity's problems, on the other hand, <i>aren't</i> user interface issues. In key continuity schemes, when your browser is first introduced to a new website, you simply are insecure. If at that moment you are MITM'd by an attacker, you might never again be secure. This isn't a UI issue: key continuity protocols don't have the information available to them on first connection to make that decision.<p>Think to yourself, if you ran the great firewall of China, which system you'd rather have: the flawed one we have now, or the one that <i>explicitly allows your connection on the first and subsequent connections to a new service to be hijacked</i>?<p>I am our resident SSL/TLS apologist. But let me be clear that this deck is good, and raises a lot of valid concerns. I think SSL/TLS is a good system, but I share the (implied) disgust at the way our PKI has been managed. Some kind of reform is needed. I just don't think it needs to come with additional engineering sacrifices.",1301273229

  What need is the iPad meeting?
</code></pre>
From the article, it sounds like the Blackberry is being <i>disrupted</i> by the iPad - but I'm not sure it fits. A disruption is where the disruptive product is initially not good enough for the incumbents' customers' needs, and it has to go elsewhere and get started with other, less demanding customers, who value it for being cheaper, more convenient or simpler. Then, the disruption gradually improves til it is good enough for the incumbents' customers. At which point, it's game over for the incumbent.<p>I'm not sure that the iPad fits this bill. It depends on the needs of the Blackberry's customers, and what they were trying to get done with it.
 It's also probably important to see the iPad not as standalone, but as ""iPad+AppStore""; and as an extension of the iPhone, since it can run iPhone apps.<p><i>EDIT</i> now I'm thinking that the Blackberry was a special-purpose solution (for the enterprise), and the iPad is a general-purpose solution. As soon as the iPad can also do what the Blackberry does, customers will switch. The odd thing is that the iPad/iPhone wasn't cheaper, more convenient or simpler - it was mainly just more general. Maybe more convenient, in being more usable.<p><i>EDIT2</i> The crucial innovation of the iPhone was adding a pointing device (multi-touch - the fact that it's <i>multi</i> is a nice extra) and a large screen. Before then, there was no mouse-like input device. Adding it was comparable to going from the Apple IIe to the Macintosh; or DOS to windows. It made the device easier to use - the crucial about this is not that it was less tedious, but that it became accessible to a new group of users, who previously could not use it. For smartphones, these people simply weren't customers before. They wouldn't have bought a Blackberry.<p>In other words, the iPhone <i>was</i> actually more convenient than the Blackberry - convenience that enabled it to target non-consumption.<p>At this point, the iPhone still wasn't good enough for Blackberry users, because it didn't have exchange integration, so RIM wasn't threatened. But when integration was added, it was good enough, and game over for RIM.",1301271904

2376509,comment,2374410,2376414,0,0,heyitsnick,,,"It's like we are talking about two entirely different subjects. Let me state it as clearly as I can:<p>- I was making absolutely no comment about whether something is true or not.<p>- I'm not saying that what was written was incorrect. And I'm not saying ""this is true but trivial"". Again, I'm making absolutely zero comment about whether what was said was accurate.<p>- My point was, <i>if you are going to answer a question asking for advice that's 'un-intuitive or not common knowledge', making over-simplified, bland recommendations on certain subjects without citation does not answer the question</i> and actually makes things worse.<p>- When I said things like ""where's the citation?"", I wasn't actually asking for HN posters to respond to back it up. I'm not strongly opposed to, say, the reading of body language. (although it's certainly interesting to go off on a tangent and discuss some specific points - I've commented on this topic below in the discussion).<p>- Instead I was using a <i>rhetorical device</i> to demonstrate that the lack of clarification and citation just further spreads unscientific 'intuitive' folklore.<p>That people are actually providing citations to something and supporting a point actually supports my argument, do you see?<p>If you now take this understanding and re-read your first response, you can see the whole ""well I feel sorry for you"" thing just doesn't jive at at all to this sub-thread of discussion.",1301270872

In terms of building brand confidence, my experience is that being honest about mistakes and what you're doing to cut down the chance they'll happen in the future is great from a customer relations point if you do it well.",1301270853

2376502,comment,2349587,2350992,1,0,markkanof,,,"That's always annoyed me when walking through a store and seeing mannequins with clothes on that look like they are cut really nicely and aren't just made for a big fat guy.  Then I walk around to the back of the mannequin and sure enough everything is pinned in place to make it look nice. I get that the clothes are made to fit onto the largest number of people, but it ends up like a design by committee type situation, where the end result is that no one really looks that good in the clothes. So yes, I can definitely see your point that the models measurements wouldn't mean much.<p>What I would like to see is specific measurements of the garment.  The distance from the collar to the bottom of the shirt, the width at the bottom of the shirt, the width of the arms, etc.  The few standard measurements that are usually provided with a dress shirt or a pair of pants are a good start, but they aren't nearly enough to judge fit.  I've had shirts custom made (via the internet) that use the reverse of this process, where I provide them all sorts of different measurements and they make the garment to fit. They all fit very well, so I have hope that making this information available could help with the fit problem.",1301270711

You simply switch to ""teaching"" other people how to do startups.<p>One thing that characters like this have in common with upper managers in large corporations is a remarkable ability to frame failures as successes, at least in terms of promoting themselves personally... which is what they really care about.",1228978789

394066,comment,393731,393908,0,0,gruseom,,,"Yes, I'm beginning to think the simple solution to this boils down to some flavor of coroutines/continuations/laziness - basically, the stuff that Scheme has that CL does not.<p>The reason I find this interesting is that it's the first real problem I've run into where CL didn't have an easy way to do what I want. There are workarounds, of course. But it's interesting to run into a production (as opposed to academic) problem where the elegant solution isn't simply available.",1228978501

394059,comment,393989,394031,0,0,derefr,,,"But enabling anonymous comments would just hurt things in the long run, no matter what kind of additional positive short-term effects it would have. People would feel little need to ""join"" the community, as they could interact with it as guests, and thus they would always feel out-of-touch with it, and apathetic to it (it would be outside their Monkeysphere.)<p>I do have one possible solution, though: for every 50 karma points you earn, say, you get a ""free gift"" of some sort <i>within the system</i> (because otherwise it would encourage gaming of the system to earn such points). One gift could be a one-use ""post this comment anonymously"" checkbox that would then disappear. Another would be, to use a fun example, the sort of ""mega-upvote"" everyone wishes they had around for when something truly deserves it.",1228977940

This part of the program I'm working on <i>is</i> sort of compiler-like, so maybe a technique like that would work.

394048,comment,393731,393731,0,0,gruseom,,,"Thanks for the replies. Several have pointed out that the unique portions of map1 and map2 are simple functions that operate on scalars and are easily composable. However, this is not true of the actual problem I'm working on. I chose a toy example so I could describe it briefly. Unfortunately, it's misleadingly simple (rather obviously so, in retrospect).<p>I guess I'll just add that it's essential that all of these be mapping functions (i.e. they take a functional argument that they call back over some range, passing a value computed using that range).",1228977688

I coasted through high school while many of my peers had to work extra hard to get good grades, and it subsequently took me seven years to finish a three year degree (an illustration degree, no less, which requires patience far greater than what I had).<p>I don't consider it a failure - I consider it a lesson well-learnt, and don't regret the time it took - but if I had developed that discipline earlier, it wouldn't have taken nearly so long nor been so difficult.",1228976958

It became popular because it served copyright infringing content that others charged for, and it makes little money.<p>The major difference however, is that YouPorn followed many pay porn sites and a huge volume of content, as opposed to YouTube which preluded TV really coming onto the web. Often you hear that the TV and movie industries have squandered their opportunity to make money off the web. YouPorn makes a case that no matter what the TV execs or movie execs had done before YouTube, the proliferation of free content would have happened anyway. People like free, even if it is inferior. DVDs have better quality than streaming, even downloading is better than streaming, but free beats 1 cent any day.",1228976698

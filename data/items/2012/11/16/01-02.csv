4792031,comment,4791295,4791794,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"I agree that the primary focus should be on critical infrastructure. But an important part of asymmetrical warfare is also to cause destabilization through uncertainty. If 4g is the norm 2 years from now and older technologies are being phased out, then disrupting the cellphone network in DC during the morning rush hour, for example, is likely to set off sufficient alarms and panic reactions that the response outweighs the disrupting incident itself. When I was younger I lived in London and the IRA was still conducting a terrorist campaign of bombing civilians as well as government targets in that city. They didn't set off bombs that frequently, but they issued bomb threats against the subway network on a near-weekly basis, and of course the authorities couldn't just blow off a bomb threat, so people's day-to-day travel routines would be disrupted at least once a month as one or other subway line were threatened.Nobody dies, but over time it adds up to a significant economic drain, to say nothing of the psychological burden it inflicts on the populace.<p><i>Important to note - it's highly unlikely that any group of people will be able to establish a coordinated attack on 20 major metros. That level of conspiracy would be stopped by the time planning got to the 3-5 city attack.</i><p>The beauty of such an attack (from an asymmetrical PoV - obviously I don't endorse such things) is that the you don't have to deal with proscribed or highly controlled things like explosives. This means that the stakes are low and you can afford redundancy. If you disrupt the LTE system for an hour at a time on a random weekday using a mobile transmission source, you could probably get away with doing so for a while. Again, the public perception that even consumer information (rather than critical) infrastructure can be disrupted at some malicious actor's pleasure is an implicit win for a hostile organization or state actor.",1353031190

Apple's center of success is gigantic subsidy from mobile operators. Investors might have reason to believe that this model is in great danger because of astonishing slew of similarly capable alternatives available to operators. On iPad front they already essentially cut their absolute margins big time by releasing iPad mini. Add introduction of slew of upcoming models running Surface/Win8 in to the mix and you can see that Apple's gigantic revenue streams are in great danger.<p>The fix for this would have been new products by Apple and that's what Mr Market has been expecting for long time. But instead we have only seen new minor versions of same old. The reason Apple's stock has been able to climb at accelerated pace so far was continuous stream of new products every 3 years and that seems to be gone now.

Like how flawed our ""pay per medical service"" system is, or how heart disease is preventable in almost all instances (but still kills Americans more than anything else), or how most modern humans in the US have diet's and exercise habits (or lack there of) that are extremely detrimental to our bodies and their pre civilization biological programming. Our bodies firmware is indisputably out of date and no one seems to care or acknowledge this fact. I'd rather have Ray and the likes pointing these facts out and imagining a future in which someone uses technology to change them vs criticizing them for not being able to predict the future on a %100 clip.

4791941,comment,4791710,4791710,3,0,btilly,,,"I would personally not buy their stock any time soon.<p>I keep meaning to write a blog entry on this.  To understand my reasoning it helps to be familiar with <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> (see <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Cause/dp/0875845851/ref=sr_1_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Ca...</a> for the book).  The basic assumption of that book (backed up with many examples in industries from ship technology to hard drives to backhoes) is that any technology that has a well-established value proposition will tend to show exponential improvement on that value proposition over time.  Users needs also follow an exponential curve, but it tends to be slower than the technology improvement curve.  (A lot slower.)  Therefore if you have 2 technologies competing for that market, eventually the cheap crappy one will be good enough, and after that point hits it wins.  The premium technology will always show great revenue curves even once their low-end users start switching, but those curves hide a great oncoming disaster.<p>In every market that Apple is in, it is the premium product.   It has competitors.  And its competitors have a pretty good sense of the value proposition that they need to deliver.  Therefore every market line for Apple is doomed.  They show no signs of having new ones to wow us with, so Apple has a world of hurt coming.<p>But, you may ask, why did they not have this problem historically?  My answer is because Steve Jobs' genius lay in constantly finding and delivering <i>new</i> value propositions.  He found and defined markets for pretty computers, light laptops, smartphones, and so on.  The whole  Innovator's Dilemma argument depends on competing on a known value proposition, and Jobs never sat still long enough for his competitors to do that.<p>Of course Jobs is now gone, and there is no sign that Apple has anyone who has that talent.",1353029662

It would be cool to see a more open version of Rocksmith where you could load up tabs/songs on demand.<p>For reference, I wouldn't pay for Soundslice, but I have already shelled out $100+ on Rocksmith (Game, Bass expansion, songs, cords, guitars, etc) and am willing to shell out more (Ex: A Rush Pack just came out I believe.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=kUXcLfe8LQ4#t=48s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=k...</a>",1353027636

He then invested the $20 million (all in) he got from Zip2 straight back into X.com which later became PayPal through what can only be described as a series of random accidents that lead to its eBay sale. That's insane risk for someone who essentially had fuck you money.<p>He then subsequently plowed the $300 or so million from the sale of PayPal to eBay, and pushed it directly into both SpaceX and Tesla - well before NASA or the world really had any need for either one of them - there was no guarantee that NASA would need SpaceX, or that COTS would continue to have government support (SpaceX bootstrapped on these contracts), or that any launch vendor would go with him over proven tech.<p>And with Tesla, there was no guarantee that laptops/smartphones/tablets would explode from 2005-2010, driving down the cost of Li-on batteries by an order of magnitude as South Asia's factories came online with their economies of scale, hundreds of millions of people and hundreds of billions in surplus capital that all combined to help make electric cars and an upstart car company price competitive with established luxury car brands.<p>There can be no doubt about it - Elon Musk takes huge risks, he is very lucky, and these are not the actions of a normal person. Normal people do not do these things - the risks he took were abominations on a risk adjusted scale (if the recession continued to decimate the economy and kill demand for veblen goods and SpaceX didn't get that 4th launch - Musk would be done - as in out of money and out of luck).<p>Which reminds me - the best investors are mentally damaged in some way, especially in terms of emotion (a distinct lack of empathy and emotion).<p>Because, if they weren't, well, they'd do what everyone else did, and be just like them.<p>To be contrarian, is to be damaged.<p>This does not mean that any of the people are mentally damaged - I merely found the studies on the relative percentages of functional psychopaths in leadership and investing positions highly curious (<a href=""http://sgforums.com/forums/2092/topics/154210"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sgforums.com/forums/2092/topics/154210</a>).",1353027617

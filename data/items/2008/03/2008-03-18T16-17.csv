139951,comment,139725,139725,0,0,parker,,,"Yeah, I'm new to web development and I'm 26... I started reading about php/mysql in January, and began developing my first application in February, and I'm about a month away from being able to launch it.<p>I didn't start from scratch though -- I knew visual basic for applications from my MS Excel jockey days, and took a couple of java courses in undergrad.  Those give you the underpinnings behind programming logic, which extends to other languages pretty easily.  Making my VB skills transfer into PHP and web development has been satisfying. It feels like I'm actually creating for the first time.<p>I had exposure to the 'online environment' at an internet startup for a year prior to this as well, which probably made the environment a little less mystifying.<p>One insight I'll give you is that I learned more in a week of sitting and coding than I did in the month of reading 3 hours a day.  Try stuff out, test it, see what works and understand what your natural tendencies are and your common mistakes.  Ask for help when you need it, but never avoid a sticking point, always push through.",1205859407

It will work for the majority of the users. More ""likes"" = stronger relationship. However, the podcast is only limited to 20 songs per day for the channels with the strongest relationship, so only the minority of power users that have more than 20 songs a day will need to explicitly follow a channel or another to keep it in the podcast.

While short term stock exchange is usually a risky waste of money, this does help illustrate certain principles.<p>The number of people suggesting that 'always buy' works shows us something: that the economy on average has grown over the past century. Reason being of course that, when one person succeeds, he provides means for another person to succeed. Thus growth begets growth, especially capital growth.

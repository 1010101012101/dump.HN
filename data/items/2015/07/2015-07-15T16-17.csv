9892460,comment,9889039,9891361,0,0,ctoscano,,,"There was at least one study I know of that visualization can mitigate the atrophy caused by immobilization by 50%. From the abstract[1]:<p>> A group of healthy individuals underwent 4 wk of wrist-hand immobilization to induce weakness. Another group also underwent 4 wk of immobilization, but they also performed mental imagery of strong muscle contractions 5 days/wk.<p>Here were their results:<p>> Immobilization decreased strength 45.1 ± 5.0%, impaired VA 23.2 ± 5.8%, and prolonged the SP 13.5 ± 2.6%. Mental imagery training, however, attenuated the loss of strength and VA by ∼50% (23.8 ± 5.6% and 12.9 ± 3.2% reductions, respectively) and eliminated prolongation of the SP (4.8 ± 2.8% reduction).<p>The Atlantic ran a story on that research paper[2].<p>I am curious if the participants in the experimental group strictly adhered to the protocol, or if they flexed their arms within the constraints. More research needs to be done, but visualization is a common practice among top athletes (Michael Phelps and &quot;watching the video tape&quot;[3]).<p>A quick Google search for visualization during exercise yielded another article[4] summarizing a study[5] on the effects of visualization on strength gain. From the abstract:<p>> The first group (N = 8) was trained to perform &quot;mental contractions&quot; of little finger abduction (ABD); the second group (N = 8) performed mental contractions of elbow (ELB) flexion; and the third group (N = 8) was not trained but participated in all measurements and served as a control group. [...] Training lasted for 12 weeks (15 min per day, 5 days per week).<p>The results:<p>> At the end of training, we found that the ABD group had increased their finger abduction strength by 35% (P < 0.005) and the ELB group augmented their elbow flexion strength by 13.5% (P < 0.001). The physical training group increased the finger abduction strength by 53% (P < 0.01). The control group showed no significant changes in strength for either finger abduction or elbow flexion tasks.<p>The nice thing about this study is that it also attempted to explain the strength increases by taking EEG measurements of brain activity. It showed a significant increase in activity related to increased control of voluntary muscle contractions.<p>This effect has been the basis for stroke recovery program developed at the University of Alabama Birmingham by Dr. Eduard Taub. Here is explaining the program and it&#x27;s results to the Dalaim Lama October 2014[6]. This is relevant because the therapy is about reorganizing the brain to use an unaffected area to regain partial muscle control. In other words, the therapy finds and strengthens new neural pathways to control the otherwise healthy muscles[7].<p>There are a lot of techniques that people have used for learning and training that we only recently started to take seriously and verify using EEG and fMRI by peering into the brain. I have been researching this stuff to inform an ed tech product for efficient lifelong learning, specifically to teach people about how the brain works and the implications and applications for learning.<p>I am trying to empower people to be efficient, confident learners. Doubt and not knowing how to learn leads people to believe that they are just &quot;not smart&quot; and discourages from from learning. It is true for children and adults.<p>[1]<a href=""http://jn.physiology.org/content/112/12/3219"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jn.physiology.org/content/112/12/3219</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/muscle-strength-is-in-the-mind/384361/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/muscle-str...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5896846/the-right-habits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5896846/the-right-habits</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sportspsychology/a/thinkstrong.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sportspsychology/a/thinks...</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?uid=14998709&cmd=showdetailview&indexed=google"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?uid=14998709&cmd=showdeta...</a><p>[6]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJlmRISL-QA&feature=youtu.be&list=UUOMZCCUBnjdhjhtNAUfkGqg&t=1h32m30s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJlmRISL-QA&feature=youtu.be...</a><p>[7]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint-induced_movement_therapy#Mechanism_of_change"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint-induced_movement_th...</a>",1436979510

A lot of large companies and banks have veteran specific programs to get us in the door, which are great. Aside from those however it&#x27;s an education game, and educating your potential employer who has no idea that you just got done running a program larger than their organization won&#x27;t really help.<p>I think a lot of combat veterans don&#x27;t understand that going into the private sector after 5 or more years in the military is akin to a software developer trying to get a job on an oil-field. Outside of specific military jobs that translate perfectly - like IT and for people with more time in service to management - it&#x27;s a wholesale change. From a skills perspective you are at a disadvantage from someone who has been in the industry for those 5 years. It&#x27;s hard to sell the veteran specific &quot;soft skills&quot; that are hard to impossible to quantify.<p>A big struggle for me was trying to break into the investor side of the tech world coming straight out of the military. So even though I had been working for years on my startup, had a co-founder, customers and an MVP - I had absolutely no network to raise seed money. I got lucky and hooked up with an Angel group that specifically targets guys like me (Hivers & Strivers Angel fund) and it ended up working out, but even though we passed that first hurdle, since I don&#x27;t have that deeper network it&#x27;s still an uphill battle because I am unproven in the tech startup world and my rolodex is very limited.",1436979333

9892430,comment,9891927,9891927,0,0,reilly3000,,," The underlying issue here is not programmatic advertising, but the proliferation of content itself. The cost of setting up a publishing operation is effectively zero, and anybody who wants to publish online is. The value of an impression will continue to slip as long as it more and more content becomes available and more of it is consumed.<p>It is unrealistic to expect or hope that the supply content should be restrained. The other side of the equation is advertiser demand, and that is restrained by complexity at this present moment: The best DSPs (demand side platforms, or ad-buying tools) are typically met with very high minimums (10K/month to 250K/year) because the cost of supporting advertisers with account reps is so high. Yes, ad tech stacks are also pretty damn hard to build, but most at this point are built for scale.<p>My vision for my company is to democratize the advertising process so that access to the best tools, talent, and strategy is available to anybody with a message to share. If we can pull that off well, anybody that aggregates a quality audience with media should be able to benefit from their effort.

If you throw a pebble into the ocean, you cannot measure that this pebble increased the water level but no one would argue otherwise. No empirical data necessary and it would be silly to argue anything else. Similarly, artificially increasing the cost of hiring labor will decrease the quantity demanded.<p>Put another way, if one were to ask an economist how does the price artificially increasing the price of X affect the quantity demanded of that product, an economist would easily be able to answer without much hesitation or inquiry into the product X. I think a higher burden of proof should be placed on those claiming that artificially increasing the cost of labor doesn&#x27;t affect quantity demanded. Since there are never any real controlled experiments in economics (states or municipalities all have their own history and other factors at play), you have to rely on theory.<p>Someone can agree for an increase in the minimum wage, but at least be honest about it being based on a moral trade-off between decreased employment opportunities for those whose labor is not above the current clearing rate and the benefit to others who would keep their jobs and enjoy higher pay.",1436978862

Say you have the typical situation with no pin on the phone and password auto-filled by the mobile browser for the site. Now if someone loses that phone, another person can login, looking at history or auto-fill settings for clues. Alternatively, if there is a password for the site, it&#x27;s either really simple or the password reset request will come in to the mail client on the phone. Since phones are way more than they used to be, for two factor these days it should be a separate dongle that only does the one factor and it is forced to have a pin by the vendor before it can be used.

You said &quot;care to elucidate?&quot;<p>For your information, I&#x27;ll tell you the reason you just entered my personal &quot;crazy&quot; list.  Absolutely nothing in the article (which I read) or any comment you replied to, prompted your comment, or followup, here.  It&#x27;s just going off the deep end for no reason whatsoever.<p>I kept seeing reference to a simple direct manager asking you to allocate your time in a way you disagreed with, and as a result you have gone on a personal crusade to badmouth an employer by name.  The real world is full of trade-offs.  I&#x27;ll give you a simple example: it is usually better for 1 person with an idea to put it up as a web app and get users, even though it is 100% guaranteed that a sole full-stack developer handling every single aspect of a production server, marketing, creating product, programming, communicating with users, media, everything - all this guarantees that there will be a security issue.  (Because 100% of software has security issues.)<p>Now according to some people, the world would be better if that one person went and walked at a bagel shop instead of creating the service at all.  These people will badmouth and put the work&#x27;s down, do everything to destroy it, simply because he is 1 guy and not a team of 10,000.  These people are (through their actions) enemies to progress, and a very very important thing for startups to do is to avoid this.<p>Now obviously the employer you mentioned with a mature company.  But focusing on delivering product is only possible if there is product to be delivered or people to buy it.  Your ethical viewpoint to me seems completely exaggerated, and insane.  As insane as if you just wrote (I hope you see this would be insane): &quot;Why did I kill her? I killed her because I cannot in good conscience allow anyone to live in the world who believes in astrology.&quot;  (I hope you see that this murder would be horrendously wrong, but based on everything you&#x27;ve written perhaps you wouldn&#x27;t.)  Let me be explicit about why it&#x27;s ethically wrong: the world is a balance of all sorts of influences, and while it is a shame that anyone believes in astrology, the responsible answer is to leave them alone or share the data you have, and if you don&#x27;t like them then to go do something else.<p>Likewise, your screeds could have been justified,  oh I don&#x27;t know, if you worked in a nuclear power plant or something and were asked to do somemthing that would cause a 2% chance of meltdown every year.  A less than perfect product does not fit this description, and it does not have the level of reliability to ascribe to it.  Just like I guarantee that any web app anyone personally makes will have security issues somewhere in the stack.<p>Nothing is 100.00000000%. The response I just read about is completely inappropriate, and you should feel bad about it.  It&#x27;s okay to be &quot;quixotic&quot;.  It&#x27;s not okay for this to extend to &quot;murder&quot; (my analogy) or destroying people worked very hard to create without putting anything constructive in its place.  This can be as simple as directing negative comments at someone making a web app.<p>Finally as a point of information I have absolutely no conflict or interest to declare in the matter, and am not connected to the company you worked for or anyone else.  You specifically asked for feedback about why comment here is totally inappropriate, and I&#x27;ve given it.<p>I judge that your ethical calculus isn&#x27;t correct at all, I think you&#x27;re in the wrong, and I think that every single time you go off on this tangent distracts people and robs them of the chance to be spending time more productively.

There is however some important nuance that is missing. Color theory is a fractal and the deeper you go the more convolutions you find. Motion picture and video artists are typically a lot deeper in the weeds of color than photographers. One phenomenon relates to the psychological perception of color. One reason the picture of the flower is never the same as the flower is that you remember it differently (and yes I realize you may look at the lcd on your camera right after shooting). People in general carry certain &quot;memory colors&quot; grass green, brick red, that do not correspond to the metered color of these things. Grass is deeper green and bricks more saturated in memory.<p>Alexis Van Hurkman wrote an amazing book called Color Correction which is about digital color grading for motion pictures and TV. The issues pomax discusses exist at every step of the process: Capture, Editing, DI, Projection. The engineering standards work around the practicalities of the physics. Canon and Nikon won&#x27;t address this issue. Their markets are dying as it is. Red might. Arri might. Panovision might. Black Magic might.<p>I suggest that pomax spend more time hanging out with cinematographers and DI artists and less time with photographers and coders to unravel more of this.<p>Last comment on the flower picture.

I may or may not be an outlier here. Take my advice with a grain of salt. :)<p>For me, the trick is to make my desire for promotion clear to The Powers That Be. I went to my boss, and I set a goal. &quot;In 3 years, I&#x27;d like your job. What do I do?&quot; If she&#x27;s a good boss (like mine was), she&#x27;ll help you put together a plan to get to that point. If she won&#x27;t help, and you really want that position, then it might be time to leave and find a new job where you might have a more amenable boss.<p>As a manager, many of my developers are perfectly happy to just code all day long. I&#x27;ve asked them about career goals, and they&#x27;ll say things like &quot;I want to learn a new language&quot; instead of &quot;I want a promotion.&quot; I think the default mindset for managers is to assume that their employees do <i>not</i> want promotions, so if you want one, you should definitely mention it at your next 1:1 with your boss.<p>You want to phrase it less as &quot;I want a promotion&quot; and more of &quot;I&#x27;ve decided on a long-term career goal as X position in Y years. What do you recommend I do to get there? I would appreciate any opportunities you can give me that move me toward that goal.&quot; Good managers will love that kind of thing and move heaven and earth to help you out. It might take 2 years to get that particular position, but small changes along the way can make a huge difference. (And by &quot;long-term goal&quot; I mean 3-5 years, so 2 years is good progress.)<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of what is the definition of a promotion? Are you talking about going from &quot;Junior Software Engineer&quot; to &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot;? That kind of promotion is generally just a title change, maybe with some increased responsibility, but not really a different job. IMO, the jump from Senior -> Lead or Engineer -> Manager is a bigger change.<p>Are you getting raises? If you&#x27;re getting raises, and your responsibilities are mostly the same, then I&#x27;d say those don&#x27;t really count as promotions. If you&#x27;re getting raises AND more responsibility, then you&#x27;re getting promotions, even if your title hasn&#x27;t changed in 10 years.

A remote culture inherently has decided that being off-site is more important to them than being able to communicate and collaborate quickly and easily.<p><i>> It is easy to reach out for help</i><p>Easier than standing up and asking for help over the cubicle wall? No.<p>I can see how the increased difficulty of communication could be arguably a better thing, but let’s not pretend it’s easier.<p><i>> There is a lot less wasted communication</i><p>This is true, but it’s balanced by the fact that the non-wasted communication costs a whole lot more. And I think it’s also an overstated claim: just because you can refer back to your communication doesn’t mean anyone actually can find the communications or actually does go back and refer to it.<p><i>> There is a lot less posturing</i><p>I can see how this is annoying, but I’m not sure how this relates to a claim of productivity. In the end, I’m not sure presenting ideas with logic is actually the best way to do things: often I’d rather just do what the best doers on the team suggest, with or without justification. The best plan is the one that gets the job done quickly and with quality, even if it’s one that’s hard to justify logically beforehand. Requiring logical justification for things means that you prioritize the talk of people who talk well over the intuition of people who are actually good at their jobs. It’s worth noting that posturing tends to be most effective for people who are respected by their teammates, which tends to correlate with being good at your job in technical fields. Posturing evolved as a behavior for a reason, and I’d not be so quick to discard it.<p>Also, there’s an apparent contradiction between &quot;Even if we are over-communicating, it is okay, because we aren&#x27;t forcing a squadron of employees to sit in a meeting room pretending to be interested.” and &quot;I have to believe that it has something to do with the fact that most of the effective communication is either written, or is done in large meetings where lots of people are watching.” Either your meetings are larger or they aren’t; don’t pick whichever fits the point you’re trying to make.<p><i>> There is often a higher caliber of workers</i><p>Uh, okay. If we’re allowed to make vague unjustified claims, I guess I can just counter with, “Remote work tends to lead to unhealthier workers because they don’t go outside”.<p><i>> You get a huge portion of your life back</i><p>This is also a pretty unjustified claim. When I worked from home I found that it was a lot harder to “turn off” when my workday was done.<p>Citing commute times is a good justification for living near where you work, not necessarily for working remotely. I’m a 25 minute train ride from my work, and having an excuse to get up and go out is pretty good for me in general.",1436976807

There are a couple of things I would say are key:<p>- Everyone has to use the same communication tools, ie everyone in the office has to be using Slack/Hipchat and regularly do hangouts with remote people<p>- All meetings have to assume someone is going to be remote. It has to be burned into the culture that when you have a meeting a laptop is open and hangouts/gotomeeting/etc are running<p>- Annual onsite is a must! I&#x27;ve been amazed how a few days of in person communication can form pretty deep bonds. Once that username has a face and some shared inside jokes they become human forever. Anyone more key on any team should also strive to make it out around quarterly. I think everyone has people they&#x27;d consider good friends that they only have met in person one or two times while attending a conference or visiting a far away friend, same goes for the office.<p>- Let your local people work from home when it makes sense! Don&#x27;t make your office people trudge through feet of snow while the remoters sip hot cocoa at home. In my experience most people working in the office actually like working in an office and most remoters like working remote. But, whenever possible, let the local people stay home if they need to wait for a package, take care of a sick kid, need some time to clear their head, the office is under construction etc.<p>Even though it sounds like the smallest one, the chat one is actually one of bigger issues. If everyone is on Slack you&#x27;ll find even people in the office start using it to communicate with people a few seats away for small stuff, sharing links, conversations you&#x27;d prefer to be quiet etc. And this eventually means that communicating with someone 10 ft and 10k miles away feels very similar.",1436976776

I really like the way you put this, and would add...<p>There are merits in the past ways of doing things.  Here&#x27;s a simple, non software related example:<p>Unfolding sheet metal parts.  This basically is calculating the flat sheet shape needed to produce a bent part of the proper dimensions.  Metal stretches when bent, meaning the flat shape is not a 1:1 representation of the 3D bent part.<p>Modern software does this with solid models.  We make the part we want, and then the software produces a flat pattern for us.  While this process is very simple, it does require one to have software, model in solids, and so forth...<p>What gets lost here is the actual dynamics of the metal.<p>Further, the analytic geometry methods go unused in most modern solutions, which actually makes unfolding more complex, organic shapes difficult and CPU intensive as they get broken down into polygons...<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, much is gained too.  Analysis, ability to work in context, and automation come with new methods.  In the vast majority of use cases, these gains make the overall current path superior.<p>However, going back to analytic geometry and manual pencil and paper means to produce these parts allows for some extremely efficient workflows and it gives people the means to check their software work, debug problems, and in the case of just wanting to make something quickly, the ability to do so by hand with only basic tools.<p>The most interesting part about this transition for me, as I was there doing it old school and transitioned to new school, is the demand for the basic methods comes up time and time again, despite the software being capable.  People just don&#x27;t always know why, just what.<p>From time to time, I teach mechanical CAD design.  When this topic comes up, I go to the white board and show them the classic methods and basically produce a complete part on a white board with no computer assist.  Once they see the why, a whole lot of software use issues go away and trust / confidence in the tools goes way up.<p>For this particular discipline, it&#x27;s not taught, but can be found in old books, or from manufacturing people who have learned it from others.<p>For most engineers, going through this grants them the ability to visualize the sheet, and or catch a lot of simple errors without having to employ verification software.  &quot;It just looks wrong&quot; becomes part of their tool set, and we all know how valuable that basic intuition is.<p>The same can be said for most manufacturing techniques.  Going back to the manual, hands on means and methods explains so much about what we do today, even though the methods themselves may not be viable in the context of modern automation and production.<p>We have come a long way indeed!

That being said, if you think that&#x27;s a possibility I seriously suggest you have a great back up plan ready (another job offer, lots off ideas you want to pursue on your own and money in the bank, etc).<p>One thing you need to remember, is that while you are valuable as an individual contributor, the founders are valuable for being able to attract and lead individual contributors of your calibre.   Believe it or not, the latter is far more valuable than the former.<p>This is why when you take a job, you really want to take a job working for people you really respect and admire, because they get a portion of credit for everyone that works for them.

As more and more people play it gets more and more data about each character, and consequently more accurate. I imagine eventually it gives up and asks you who you meant - and adds that character to the database. Given that I picked Brian Cox and it said 7500 people had picked him before, it clearly has <i>a lot</i> of data to work with.<p>What&#x27;s more interesting (to me) is <i>why</i> someone created this game. Maybe it&#x27;s to sell ads, but that database has to be quite valuable as a corpus of information about relatively famous people...

6814016,comment,6812499,6813217,6,0,jamii,,,"I&#x27;m just going to copy-and-paste this old comment:<p>When evaluating language tradeoffs the scala community values power more and the clojure community values simplicity more.<p>Scala wants to provide you with the most powerful language possible. Clojure wants to make it easy for you to mold your own language.<p>Scala language tooling works at compile-time and analyses the language statically. Clojure language tooling connects to a running environment and uses introspection. Scala has much better static checking and clojure has much better introspection. While both languages have a repl, the clojure community puts much more emphasis on live, interactive programming.<p>Clojures syntactic extension mechanisms are much simpler, being based on sexps. Scalas are powerful (eg can access the lexical environment) but much more heavy-weight.<p>Clojure has run-time eval. This makes it possible to do eg domain-specific jit (eg compiling DSLs -> clojure code -> java bytecode on the fly). Scala has a run-time interpreter which I haven&#x27;t used but is reputed to be slow.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet explored non-jvm backends for scala but I suspect that clojure will eventually dominate on that front for two reasons: 1) when clojure-in-clojure is finished porting clojure to a new platform will be far easier than scala and 2) clojure was designed from the beginning to be a parasitic language and delegates many features to the underlying platform.<p>Scala breaks backwards compatibility much more often than clojure. Whether this is a pro or con is up for debate. There are lots of small niggling things in clojure I would like to change but on the other hand maintaining scala code across compiler updates is a pain in the ass.<p>Personally, I believe that the number one problem a language needs to address is managing complexity. The clojure community largely seems to get that and is driving for simple, orthogonal language features and libraries to an extent that I&#x27;ve not seen in any other community (eg <a href=""http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2012/10/1/prismatics-graph-at-strange-loop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2012/10/1/prismatics-graph...</a>). In addition, the most exciting research I&#x27;ve seen on that front (eg <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf</a> <a href=""http://boom.cs.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boom.cs.berkeley.edu/</a> ) and most of my favorite tools rely on powerful introspection and runtime code generation. I think Yegge describes this better than I can - <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/pinocchio-problem....</a>",1385636261

Much of the startup founding crowd reads this the wrong way.<p>Top talent seeks better perks <i>because</i> they already have a high salary. When you are already paid well over what you need, getting your own, quiet office and free lunch is a good trade for additional money that would be ok (I mean, who refuses a raise?), but not a major improvement.<p>I, for one, have refused a lot of job offers that went along the lines of &quot;we&#x27;re cool to work with and we have a lot of perks because we&#x27;re targeting people who appreciate what they do and the atmosphere they do it in rather than upfront pay&quot;. This has become so common that I began refusing it in a rather snarky tone. If I wanted a great atmosphere, I&#x27;d strike a deal with the local pub and work from there.<p>Good perks can give you an edge, but the only case when they can compensate for below-par salary is when you&#x27;re working with young developers that are talented, but unsure of their skills and low on self-esteem.

6813997,comment,6810511,6812817,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"From my understanding (which may be limited), treble damages only apply when someone willingly infringes on a patent. So this would be a scenario where someone identifies a patent that relates to what they&#x27;re building, but they build it anyway. This is very different from identifying existing patents specifically to ensure one does not infringe. In this second scenario someone identifies a patent that relates to what they&#x27;re building, so they modify what they&#x27;re building as not to infringe. In some (extreme) cases, this might mean the project should be abandoned. In other (not so extreme) cases, this might mean you need to change one (or more) aspect(s) of the project. In any event, and aside from the legal aspects, I think it&#x27;s a good exercise for anyone building something. You might avoid future legal issues, you might become more aware of where technology is going (vice a perspective built on currently released products), and it might help you innovate further. Brain food.<p>I believe that patent trolls &quot;win&quot; when everyone is too scared to stand up for what they believe in. Plain and simple, if people don&#x27;t take a stand, then things won&#x27;t change. And I don&#x27;t necessarily mean just taking a stand in court, I&#x27;m talking more about how we (as developers and innovators) react to the issue. I agree that leaving the US will probably lower your chances of becoming a patent troll victim, but everything is relative. Maybe you&#x27;re building something truly novel and innovative and you want to protect it? Would this outweigh the risk of becoming a patent troll victim? I guess it depends on what (and where) you&#x27;re building.",1385635750

If your car gets stolen and you ask the police for help, are you stealing?<p>If you don&#x27;t want to pay your taxes, leave the country and build your own, with roads, running water, infrastructure et. all. If you find you need outside investment to &quot;bootstrap&quot; your new country, then you may end up paying dividends to your investors just so you can have running water - how is this any different from taxes?<p>Okay, you might say - but why don&#x27;t we let private companies manage roads, infrastructure, and others? You should ask yourself, do you really want a company whos job it is to maximize profits to be running these basic services? We already have a couple examples of how privately run institutions with perverse incentives can ruin peoples lives.<p>Lets look at the prison industry, which is now private. They benefit from the free labour of prisoners indirectly giving them an incentive to have as many people as possible in prison. As a result America has the worlds highest incarceration rate by a wide margin[1]. Often these people are in prison for reasons illegitimate. While these people are in prison they also represent an innumerable net loss to the actual economy. These are people who could be getting educated or running higher worth jobs.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be a stretch of the imagination that running a country - managing the resources and happiness of millions of people as well managing relations with other countries as represented by millions of other people is an incredibly complex task. Simply boiling down &quot;taxes = stealing&quot; is too simple and naive to actually strongly consider.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/us-incarceration.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/us-incarcerati...</a>",1385635741

There is no way for the minority to do anything but wait until the next election and hope. So conflicts are not really resolved, but rather one side orders the other to shut up and do as they say.<p>A true resolution would be when both sides agree on the price. An simple example would be this:<p>I would like to throw a party on my lawn, but my neighbor disagrees. I really want that party though, cos it&#x27;s my birthday, so I would go to my neighbor and try to convince him to let me have a party. I can see he wouldn&#x27;t appreciate the noise so I would offer him something in exchange for his inconvenience: maybe I would let him use my bathtub for the next month, or maybe I would simply give him some money. If it wasn&#x27;t just my one neighbor, but maybe 3 or 5 of them, I would have to convince them all and pay them all and that would make my party very expensive, so I would consider cancelling it.<p>Now on a larger scale, imagine you&#x27;d have various law firms, each protecting their clients interests and bargaining on their behalf. So, for instance, clients of one firm wouldn&#x27;t like gay people to marry, while clients of that other firm, obviously many of the are gay, would be in favor of it. Even if we suppose that those who oppose gay marriage are the majority, they still probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to outbid the minority here. That&#x27;s because when people are asked to pay to teach others how to live, it becomes painfully obvious most of them are not ready spend their money on it.",1385635632

6813963,comment,6809990,6809990,12,0,Udo,,,"This is basically the same phenomenon that happens with frameworks. At first, the framework gives you a ton of functionality for the (initially) low price of living with its abstractions. As you want more custom functionality, you find yourself either fighting the framework with increasing levels of desperation, or simply coding around it. I&#x27;d argue that the best frameworks are such that you can code around them without causing huge overhead or resorting to objectionable tricks.<p>The same goes for CMSes. Many CMS customers would probably be better off if they took the CMS editor interface as a separate component and wrote the actual page renderer as a custom development separately. The trouble is of course, content systems make it very hard to do that. Having to make things work with the native mechanisms (and the often horrific underlying data model) is what makes huge CMS projects fail or at least perform miserably for everyone involved.<p>On the very top of the list of abhorrently convolute CMSes would probably have to be Typo3, followed after some distance by Drupal. But the more you work with the initially-liberal Wordpress the more you discover it&#x27;s not that far behind either.<p>This reminds me of a bygone era: my startup (now long gone) had its own CMS. Sadly, that wasn&#x27;t our actual product as we were a pure service company and the CMS was only a tool for us. In hindsight, we should have done it the other way around. Our CMS wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it shone in a few areas that made the life of both developers and content editors very easy: a simple, accessible data model and an easily extensible page renderer. Unlike many other solutions it was designed to get things done, not to bill a lot of consultant hours. I&#x27;ve yet to come across an open source (or commercial for that matter) CMS that works equally well.",1385634913

Basically I agree with you. 8 years ago I saw the start of an explosion of new languages/frameworks/etc. All solving 1 of more things of a bigger problem. To my mind it became too fragmented, too many layers where too many things can go wrong and if not, will have a performance penalty.<p>So I went to a more abstract approach by working visually in models. After some tries I discovered the OutSystems development environment for web applications and am working with it since on a daily base. The advantage of working visually is that I don&#x27;t know or see what the compiler creates. (of course I encounter some SQL, JS, CSS and HTML)<p>However, sometimes I miss text based coding, so this year I looked around to see if the development situation had become better. In my opinion it has not. There seems to be less fragmentation but that&#x27;s probably caused by the fact that only a select set survived. Besides that new initiatives have been started.<p>Personally I like the idea of using C as a cross platform language; because it already IS. However, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the lower levels of the used languages use it already in some form (remember it always needs to go native). Besides that, I think that if C would be the standard then within a couple of weeks you will have language X to C compilers and then have ABC->X->C and then have a webvariant WEB->ABC->X->C while undoubtedly someone will create a Javascript to web to abc to x to c compiler. And than there we are again where we started :)<p>So in my opinion the problem lays with the chains. Some abstraction is needed of course but not several layers on layers. I would like to see more direct to (e.g.) c compilers: JS->C, Web->C, ABC->C, X->C whereby it is not the goal to program in C but have it as an intermediate format.<p>I believe that software development has not grown forward enough. There is plenty movement left and right but not going forward. So, I am back to my visual modelling environment and will check later on...",1385634304

Ultimately, we want to adjust this ratio and allow for a\n  much smaller inactive list.  These patches are an essential step in\n  this direction because they decouple the VMs ability to detect working\n  set changes from the inactive list size.  This would allow us to base\n  the inactive list size on the combined readahead window size for\n  example and potentially protect a much bigger working set.\n\n  Another possibility of having thrashing information would be to\n  revisit the idea of local reclaim in the form of zero-config memory\n  control groups.  Instead of having allocating tasks go straight to\n  global reclaim, they could try to reclaim the pages in the memcg they\n  are part of first, as long as the group is not thrashing.  This would\n  allow a user to drop e.g. a back-up job in an otherwise unconfigured\n  memcg and it would only inflate (and possibly do global reclaim) until\n  it has enough memory to do proper readahead.  But once it reaches that\n  point and stops thrashing it would just recycle its own used-once\n  pages without kicking out the cache of any other tasks in the system\n  more than necessary.

Wherever there is an opportunity to assert power and dominion over others, someone will step up and take power by force or coercion.<p>Governments formed as those that took power needed a system by which to subjugate those within their territory and indoctrinate them to help expand their influence.<p>It took centuries for people to adjust those political systems to remove ultimate power from one individual and disperse it amongst many.  The more people that have influence over the power structure, the less likely that it&#x27;ll be able to do really evil things.<p>Our modern democracies are literally the result of thousands of years of evolution of our social contract.<p>If you think they are so bad, look at countries/places where the government has very little power to control its population.  What results are militias and other armed groups that use force to exert influence and maintain power.  This struggle is happening pretty opening in Mexico, for example.<p>If you were, today, make all government disappear, the world would become a chaos of small groups fighting for power.  Over years/decades, groups would push out other groups, and gain larger territories. As size increases, the need to keep the population in line (to remain in power) would require those in power to maintain order through laws, police, and provide services.<p>Government is inevitable.",1385633734

Nothing quite beats their prices.<p>Here&#x27;s an easy example: when the iPad came out at $499, the first competing touch tablets come out at $749 (and of course were crap compared to it too). It took competitors years to reach and go below iPad level prices.<p>You also have to know what you&#x27;re getting and compare like for like. You cannot compare a machine on the medium or lower end of the market with one on the upper end. Hi-end offerings from Dell, Sony etc, are the same (or usually more) expensive as Apple&#x27;s offering, when you match features. And you still don&#x27;t get them all.<p>Was trying to get a PC laptop to match a Retina MPB the other day. I added the configuration options to match it and got it as far as $1700 for the PC laptop on the vendor website. It also had a VGA port as standard, that the MBP doesn&#x27;t have. Seems like a bargain compared to the MBP I targeted that&#x27;s $2599, right?<p>Only the PC didn&#x27;t have hidpi screen, had half the memory (8 vs 16GB), had a 750 HD and not a 512 SSD.<p>Those differences easily match or surpass the $900 difference.<p>What it also didn&#x27;t have that isn&#x27;t easily measured, but matters a lot?<p>-- it wasn&#x27;t as light (I carry my laptop a lot).\n-- it wasn&#x27;t as battery effiecient (I use my laptop outside a lot).<p>Heck, I&#x27;d pay the $900 even just for the twice as much battery life. When you add the with SSD vs HD, hidpi vs plain monitor and weight, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>And there&#x27;s other, minor stuff that adds up: it didn&#x27;t have as a solid construction, it didn&#x27;t have a magsafe-like power connector (tripping on a wire means the laptop goes down -- and I&#x27;ve had that happen in the past), it didn&#x27;t have a multitouch-glass trackpad, it didn&#x27;t have an illuminated keyboard, it&#x27;s thicker, etc etc.<p>Oh, and it didn&#x27;t come with OS X (and for free!).

You look at, say, a Panasonic NCR18650 [1] and it&#x27;s very affordable, but it loses 20% of its capacity after just 300 charge cycles. It depends on temprature, charge rate, depth of discharge and so on, so designers can trade off longevity for upfront cost. There are alternative battery chemistries that last longer - some manufacturers claim more than 10,000 charge cycles [2] but how do you test a manufacturer&#x27;s claims that a battery will last 30 years without waiting until the technology is 30 years old? Or maybe the future is batteries getting swapped at change stations, Tesla style, so you&#x27;ll end up with a different battery every day.<p>We consumers aren&#x27;t equipped to evaluate the longevity claims of the manufacturers, so why should we take on the risk when that 30-year battery might break after 3 years? On the other hand if we pay by the month or by the mile, if it needs replacement after 3 years that&#x27;s the manufacturer&#x27;s problem.<p>In other words, renting gives the manufacturer an incentive not to cut corners, and to make sure their products are long-lasting and low maintenance, because the longer the product lasts the better the profit. Sure beats the printer ink economic model, where the manufacturers have an incentive to make cheap products that don&#x27;t last long because selling more replacements means more profit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf2/ACA4000/ACA4000CE240.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-data/pdf2/ACA4000/ACA400...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.altairnano.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/60Ah-DataSheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altairnano.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/60Ah-Da...</a>",1385632913

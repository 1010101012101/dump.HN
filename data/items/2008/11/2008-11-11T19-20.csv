360871,comment,360738,360832,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"> And that's only for one data packet.<p>A crucial point.  A few years back, I had to deal with some rather ""chatty"" applications that were attempting to span filesets/databases located in both the U.S. and India.  Latency on a single data exchange might be annoying; multiply that by hundreds or thousands of exchanges per each human-level interaction with the application, and said application ground to something that would make a ""crawl"" look high speed.<p>Partly the vendor's fault, for not accurately representing this situation.  Partly the Company's fault for neither anticipating nor investigating it (nor listening to me when I advocated doing so); further, for attempting a non-standard deployment in an attempt to save a few bucks.<p>I guess I'll blame the vendor again for such an unnecessarily verbose and crap-laden application design.  Anyway, the whole thing turned into one giant, festering pool of fail, that the users actively avoided when they could and loathed and sweated over when they couldn't.  Eventually, turnover at the pointy haired boss level made it politically feasible to kill more and more of the pieces, and now some years later the Company has supposedly ponied up the money for a solution that actually works (well, the demos look/work better, and the basic design seems capable of allowing it to work).<p>When I think of the countless hours and frustration wasted on that doomed deployment.<p>So, anyway, watch your network latency, know your application design, and pay attention to the implications.  When testing, test network performance, and inject latency, noise and the like to get a picture of what things will look like in the real world.<p>Sounds simple; nonetheless, this technologically relatively sophisticated company still managed to completely screw it up.",1226433078

It's incredibly easy to start a company; it's incredibly difficult to finish one successfully.

If not, you don't have much to offer besides the money.<p>Put yourself in a candidate's shoes and ask yourself: what do you have to offer that they can't get on their own?  What's to stop a candidate from taking your idea and competing with you?<p>A pre-traction startup is riskier for employees than it is for founders.  If it fails, they get to put ""Software Engineer at Company Nobody Has Heard Of"" on their resume, while you at least have a founder title.  They probably will learn fewer skills.  And they don't get the feeling of being in control of their own destiny, because you're calling the shots.<p>The only thing they <i>do</i> get is a salary, as well as not having the responsibility for success or failure fall on their shoulders.  But here you say you want someone who's not really interested in the money, and you want them to take a passionate, active role in the startup.  If they don't care about the salary, and the responsibility falls upon their shoulders anyways, why should they work for you instead of starting their own startup?",1226431999

Yeah, we have it now, but let's say a night club give its visitors glasses which broadcast what they're seeing through a website so people can check if it's worth going... live streaming on stereoids. Or on sports matches... televisions would love to have more cameras on stadiums. Just imagine if you can figure out that an spectator, from glasses #44403, looked from seat 34 to ZXY axis, which is where something that you wanted to see happened, but your camera couldn't catch.<p>Mesh networks? 10 years ago we didn't have mobile internet, so it came and was expensive, now it's everywhere, and getting cheaper. But I think it's inevitable, someday someone will release a cellphone that can mesh and has mile range, and connect to free wifi networks on Starbucks, and managing all these small hubs of bandwidth inteligentlly will be hard.<p>Video will keep getting bigger, because tvs are getting bigger, encoders are getting better, and all that stuff. Sure more bandwidth helps, it always does, but imagine a movie studio instead of releasing to cinemas, they will, at the same day, release for download ""directly"" to your TV. So this video will have to be mirrored around the world, on cities, etc... because bandwidth pipe will keep getting larger, but there's always room to save costs.<p>If you want to go even further into the future, think space tourism, news from the/for a ISS-like hotel... er.. better get back to work.",1226430093

I think that clamping down once is good enough to send the message across. I'd hope so, anyway, since it takes a lot of effort to get to the point where you can vote things up and down.",1226430036

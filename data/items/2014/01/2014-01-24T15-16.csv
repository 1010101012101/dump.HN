I looked into driving for them to make a few extra bucks and the one thing they could do to get a leg up on their competition is clarify the insurance situation.<p>They all essentially claim that a driver&#x27;s personal auto insurance is good enough and combined with the companies umbrella policy provides sufficient coverage.  But then if you go and read their fine print that really isn&#x27;t the case and if you were to be involved in an accident while driving for them there is a good chance no insurance would cover damage to yourself as the driver or your car.",1390579192

While I&#x27;ve never worked in the valley I have researched and interviewed with 10+ companies there.<p>My findings were that startups there are extremely busy. They are slow to respond to emails, meetings and interviews are often missed/rescheduled, and salaries are relatively low (<100k). When talking to execs it became clear that they demand 45+ hours a week.<p>Compare that to Austin, Seattle, DC, Chicago, and Portland, who all have thriving startup communities that often match SV wages, and SV starts to look less appealing.<p>SV working conditions are not something a college grad should strive for. They should focus on locking down a nice salary with relatively cheap living costs, clearing themselves of debt, and growing their personal worth with side projects.",1390578414

There were people involved in letter writing and politcal campaining at one end, and lab-raiding at the other end.<p>Some of the people raiding labs tried to exploit loopholes in English law to get hold of documents. If you have no i tent to permanently deprive the owner it isn&#x27;t theft, so they would take documents, copy them, and return them.  They lost that argument.<p>And then things got a bit more extreme.<p>Anti fur campaigners set &quot;smoke bombs&quot; in coats, with the intent to trigger sprinkler systems and cause water damage. The sprinkler systems didn&#x27;t work and the shops burnt down.<p>Some people involved in animal industries faked bombs - someone involved in running a hunt claimed activists had set a bomb in his vehicle when he&#x27;d done it.<p>Then anti hunt activists dug up corpses for ransom.<p>Relevant to this thread is the amount of activity around Huntingdon Life Sciences.  Activists used a variety of tactics such as campaigning outside suppliers to HLS. Those suppliers increased their prices or dropped out, which increased costs.  Some activists campaigned outside the homes of people who worked at HLS or their suppliers.<p>While I support peaceful vigorous protest (and I hold a gently anti-vivisection viewpoint) I found a lot of the protesting really troubling.<p>There was talk of changing the law.

To purchase paint and canvas?</i><p>That&#x27;s not a relevant question. It depends on what you want to do. If you want to play acoustic guitar on the streets, sure, you don&#x27;t need much. That doesn&#x27;t meant that everybody wanted to be creative in that way.<p>Some people (milions) wanted to make records like the Beatles or Kraftwerk, or Led Zepellin etc. Some even wanted to write orchestral scores like they heard from John Williams.<p>That you can write a song on a $20 ukelele doesn&#x27;t mean that wanting to write a 5-piece band with reverbs, compressors, clean sounds and 24 channels is not a valid artistic endeavour.<p>That you could buy an 4-track and record some demo-quality material doesn&#x27;t mean that the PC hasn&#x27;t lowered to barried to entry, to the point that someone can produce in his garage/bedroom songs that could only be produced with tens of thousands of dollars of studio time.<p>The same with movie/video production. At best you had access to (expensive) 8 or 16mm film and mighty expensive specialist tools. Now you can have a full blown editing suite, and HD or even 4K cameras for a few thousand dollars.<p>><i>Also, 128-channel audio recording postdated the personal PC.</i><p>Postdated and made possible by the personal PC. I didn&#x27;t say it appeared instantly along the PC. First there was cheap MIDI and sequencers, something that helped tens of thousands of electronic musicians.<p>><i>And the $100k pricetag is absolute rubbish. 8-track recorders weren&#x27;t 6-figure investments, not to mention that machines that could record good quality audio in the 80s were categorically not $1k PCs.</i><p>This is dense. Of course &quot;machines that could record good quality audio in the 80s were categorically not $1k PCs&quot;. NOW THEY ARE. That&#x27;s my point.<p>Again you somehow assume that I said that all those things were made possible the very moment the PC was available -- whereas what I said is that were made possible BY the PC.<p>The $100,000 price tag is the equivalent of what you get, in sound mangling capacity, with a $2000 PC and a $500 DAW -- recording, reverbs, etc.<p>Actually, there were synths, like the Fairlight that only ultra rich artists could afford, people like Gabriel, and that costed $25,000 to buy. Now you can get the same exact specs as an $10 iPad app.<p>><i>As for CAD, sure, you got me there. But the subtext of the conversation has been artistic creativity, not engineering craft skills.</i><p>Perhaps you&#x27;ve been confused. Artist creativity in the sense of what options artists have to create things. Artists including industrial designers and such. Not in the sense of &quot;how creative an artist is&quot;, e.g the quality of his output.<p>This is about how enmpowering the PC has been for lots of artistic endeavours. E.g not if Bach is better than Depeche Mode, but that Depeche Mode could get the sounds they wanted in the first place.<p>><i>Actually, it does. Democratisation means &quot;everyone gets a go&quot;, not &quot;the elites get more power&quot;.</i><p>Not really, it just means &quot;more people than before get a go&quot;.<p>If something was available to X and now is available to 1000*X, that&#x27;s democratization.<p>May I remind you that ancient Athenian democracy, one of the fullest and most direct examples of democracy in how the election body operated, excluded women and slaves?",1390577250

This may be why you see loans with similar verbiage when browsing the Lend page of our website.<p>While these similarities shouldn&#x27;t be a cause of alarm, you may be interested to know that Kiva does use a process called borrower verification to to verify the accuracy of the information included in the borrower profiles posted on the Kiva website.<p>Hope this provides some helpful context, and if you have any other questions, let me know!&quot;",1390576607

No one knows what&#x27;s going to happen in the future.<p>I expect this discontent to grow, but I don&#x27;t think that most people have an issue with &quot;tech firms&quot;. It&#x27;s unfocused anger about economic stagnation and real estate malfeasance. I doubt the people being priced out of the Mission care strongly about PRISM. People are trying to direct this unfocused anger (which looks like it might be the nebula of a left-wing Tea Party) toward their own pet issues (surveillance) and it won&#x27;t work that way in the long run. If this dog runs loose, it will go where it wants.<p>Having traveled pretty extensively about the country, I think technology has a huge problem with &quot;placism&quot;, coupled with an unhealthy obsession with pedigree. There&#x27;s no good reason for technology to be one of the industries where location matters most. It should be the other way. But Sand Hill Road VCs won&#x27;t take you seriously if you&#x27;re more than 50 miles away, companies like Google keep the best projects in the Valley office, and having gone to Stanford matters more than a 150+ IQ. (That&#x27;s not to say that &quot;having a 150+ IQ&quot;, alone, should mean that much. But it is self-evident that a noisy signal of intelligence should be taken less seriously than raw intelligence itself.) It&#x27;s unhealthy for technology, it&#x27;s bad for the Bay Area, and it&#x27;s catastrophic for the rest of the country. Now we&#x27;re seeing pushback against technology&#x27;s location perversion coming not from the engineers, but from Bay Area locals who are entirely disinterested in technology&#x27;s placist dynamics, and who don&#x27;t have strong opinions of technology either way, any more than Parisians in 1793 gave a shit which province got its swamps drained and how such decisions derived from machinations in Versailles.<p>If there is a wave of violence in the U.S., it won&#x27;t be &quot;against tech firms&quot; because tech is not a day-to-day problem for most angry Americans. (Besides, most cities would love to steal a few tech firms from San Francisco, whose people sense saturation and no longer want them.) It will be broader, less localized, and it will be, toward its end, very differently from what it was when it started. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s desirable, either; those sorts of processes are too nonlinear and volatile for anyone to hold blanket opinions either way.",1390576230

If the currency was successful, the end user was never intended to be able to mine a meaningful level of currency themselves. The act of mining is required to facilitate transactions and miners get a small part of those transactions for participating. The initial payouts are there solely (in theory) as incentive for the early adopters to mine when the transaction volume is small and to allow them to give the currency an early liquidity. In practice, because of the deflationary nature of the coin and the domination of speculation over transactions involving some tangible goods or services, people are hoarding them expecting increases in value.

It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it plays out.

They can totally do that.</i><p>Yeah, I had been thinking about how TARP required congressional approval but, of course, the _reason_ it required congressional approval was because the &quot;troubled assets&quot; in question were not Treasuries. A little investigation reveals that section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act authorises the Fed &quot;To buy and sell, at home or abroad, bonds and notes of the United States&quot;.<p><i>> ..whether the increased supply of USD would have a higher velocity than it did when China was sitting on it, which could lead to a weaker dollar or substantial inflation.</i><p>Weaker dollar? Definitely. I expect the ECB and banks of England and Japan would buy dollars - both to help the US stabilise markets and to avoid their own currencies growing tooo strong - but I&#x27;d still expect to see a significant drop in the value of USD. 20%, maybe?<p>Substantial inflation? Inflation is a longer-term, delayed reaction sort of thing so I reckon it would depend on what happened subsequently.<p>The funny thing is that, having been through the turmoil of September 2008, the financial system is probably better prepared and positioned now, than it was before the Financial Crisis, to deal with the turmoil that would be caused by China dumping its Treasury holdings.",1390575634

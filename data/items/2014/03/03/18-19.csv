However, we are still watching our cohorts carefully to make sure that all the users get a good experience and continue to use Plivo.<p>>Does the open source version create urgency/needs payoff?<p>We definitely think that this has paid off. It&#x27;s really increased our mindshare in the open source community and the connection to users have been very positive.<p>>Can you say that the open source version of your product acted as a marketing channel? ex. get users to eventually paying for your paid or pro version?<p>The short answer is yes. Although, VoiceChatAPI is only one of many things you can build with Plivo, it has definitely shown a lot of people the possibilities and that has got people interested in using us for other things.<p>>Do you think the open source version will end up cannibalizing your own paid product?<p>No. The open source version is an unique offering and there will always be businesses who would want to pay more for a more full-featured service. Users who want to host themselves, should have access and those who want more have the option as well.<p>>Where are you hosting your pages and web api?<p>It&#x27;s on Heroku.<p>>If you would do it again, what would you do differently?<p>We would&#x27;ve done this much earlier.",1393873171

We’re building mobile tools to help people communicate and collaborate at work, whether they’re knowledge workers or line workers. Mobile phones can mean more than photo-sharing or checkins. They can mean better day-to-day work and more opportunities for people who were left out in the past.<p>What we are looking for: We’re looking for someone to help us build an amazing web experience, both for mobile and desktop. Our product is aimed primarily at mobile users, so it’s very important that our pages are responsive on smaller screens, touch-friendly, and lightweight, while also looking great on traditional desktop displays. We have a ridiculously talented set of engineers and we’re looking for a front-end developer to join us. You’ll have a ton of technical autonomy: should we use Ember, Backbone, something else, or nothing? You lead those decisions.<p>Why us:\nWe’re funded, which means we can pay competitive salaries and offer benefits. We’re also small, which means we don’t waste time on things like tracking vacation and sick days. Our passion is building great products and our goal is to bring them to a wider audience than the web ever let us reach.

7335546,comment,7333337,7334316,1,0,akbar501,,,"In the tradeoff between a short post and a long elaboration, I erred on the side of being too terse.<p>Node applications can be split between stateful servers (ex. chat) and stateless (ex. API for mobile clients).<p>It&#x27;s the stateless servers where some developers write fault tolerant / fail fast / fast restart applications. Doing so in a stateful server would be counter productive.<p>Also, this does not mean to imply that developers are writing sloppy code that fails constantly or that they fail to implement proper error handling. What I was stating is that unhandled exceptions are unexpected, but when they do occur they indicate something is seriously wrong. Importantly, this puts the application&#x27;s state into an unknown state, which is difficult to recover from. In such situations, a robust approach is to let Node fail, restart fast, and have clean state.<p>The reasons this is a sound approach are:<p>1. If the failure is due to a memory leak, then the graphs will highlight said leak clearly<p>2. The unhandled exception indicates that something is very wrong. A server restart is easily seen in the logs and is a warning that deeper inspection is necessary<p>3. Recovering state after an <i></i>unhandled exception<i></i> is difficult. In a stateless server its better to just restart from a clean state. This assumes the engineers wrote the application to work from a clean state (i.e. after a restart there is no need to recreate state)<p>4. A fault tolerant architecture is good practice as disks can fail, CPUs can fail, network connections can fail, etc. In a cluster failure is expected and applications are architected to continue operation in the face of failure",1393872529

7335536,comment,7334659,7334659,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think there is, but I can&#x27;t prove it. I have anecdotes about specific companies, and some companies are viciously sexist while others aren&#x27;t. Most of the sexism comes from the mainstream business culture (what I sometimes call &quot;MBA culture&quot; but that&#x27;s not entirely fair because some MBAs are fine) and not from tech itself. (Brogrammers are trying to be ballers, not hackers.) The more &quot;corporate&quot; a tech company is, the more it will be sexist. Often this isn&#x27;t overt, so much as an artifact; women get the shaft not because of explicit sexism but because they don&#x27;t negotiate for themselves or elbow their way on to the best projects.<p><i>Regression analysis was used to estimate wage differences, after controlling for the following choices and characteristics: graduates’ occupation, economic sector, hours worked, employment status (having multiple jobs as opposed to one full-time job), months unemployed since graduation, grade point average, undergraduate major, kind of institution attended, age, geographical region, and marital status.</i><p>That&#x27;s really misleading. Some of those variables at least <i>might</i> have gender baked into them. For one example, let&#x27;s say that women are more likely to have longer unemployment spells after college. (I don&#x27;t know if this is true.) Then there could be zero gender correlation in the model not because there is none, but because that input factors it out.<p>With 11 variables, some of those being categories, you&#x27;re going to almost certainly have &quot;small data&quot; issues on real world datasets, where the inputs (empirical &quot;design matrix&quot;) are not even remotely orthogonal. So pardon me if I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that companies explicitly choose to pay women poorly. It&#x27;s that many tech companies end up with shitty cultures that exclude women, which leaves them out of the loop and causes them to end up on shitty projects. It doesn&#x27;t happen by intention. The leadership of most tech companies is criminally negligent on <i>a lot</i> of cultural issues, but not explicitly sexist.<p>ETA: it&#x27;s also worth pointing out the &quot;women don&#x27;t negotiate&quot; argument. I think this is because they get worse results. My wife is a better negotiator than I am, in terms of skill level, but whenever we have to haggle on the price of something, I go out... and I often get more, not because I am better, but because a 6&#x27; male is more intimidating.",1393872452

People would start negotiating for more vacation, more holidays, better benefits, a bigger office, a company car, an assistant, a private &quot;education budget&quot; (ie, pay me to take a vacation) or whatever else they can. The number of ways to compensate someone are limited only by imagination and can move much more quickly than regulation can catch up.<p>A small example of this is when the US froze wages during World War 2, thus employers started offering perks like company-paid health insurance. That has since evolved into the mess we have now - that sure worked out great for everyone, didn&#x27;t it?",1393871180

And there are obviously situations of humanitarian catastrophe, such as a natural disaster or a famine, where direct distribution of aid is the right answer.<p>My objection to most handout programs is based on the negative psychological effects I experienced time and again while working with development assistance grants in Africa and Asia.  The resources we distributed would certainly result in an economic boost, but they also fundamentally changed the way the recipients saw themselves, and the way we saw them.  Handouts caused the recipients to view themselves as dependents whose fortunes were subject to the whims of luck and on pleasing donors, rather than on themselves as drivers of their own lives.  When repeated enough, this psychological side effect can be devastating not only for the individual recipient, but for the broader community that has come to depend on the handouts.<p>The dynamics in microfinance loans are much healthier in my experience - especially in a market-oriented community like Zidisha, where borrowers offer their own loan terms and lenders base their lending decisions on the borrowers&#x27; own demonstrated performance with past loans.

In truth, my sister appears to me more competent than her bf who is in the same field and it&#x27;s nothing to do with gender. My daughter always compares herself to those who are better so it&#x27;s frustrating, to say the least. &quot;YOU&#x27;RE GOOD!&quot; &quot;NO, NOT AS GOOD AS <OTHER PERSON WHO IS BETTER>&quot;. Argh.<p>I guess all this female discrimination just hasn&#x27;t existed for my own personal interaction with others, not to say that women haven&#x27;t experienced it. I suspect when they get into mothering age, they have to make a decision to further their career or their family which is probably where a lot of the &quot;gap&quot; comes from.<p>Interestingly, my daughter&#x27;s school tries to indoctrinate certain lines of thought into them and hearing her opinion on it is always enjoyable to me. Generally, she is of the opinion that men and women are different, make different decisions based on their personal experience and as such, are responsible for their outcomes. I&#x27;m sure a lot of that comes from me, but I&#x27;m glad she is a critical thinker. She specifically says she doesn&#x27;t understand why there is a &quot;girls who code&quot; and refuses to go there, even though I&#x27;ve encouraged her to go.<p>This summer, she will be joining a programming class with 17 year olds, and she is 13. To say I&#x27;m proud of her would be understating it. My opinion on this topic may change, depending on her experience there, since this would be the most likely equivalent to her future working life experience.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I coach a kid&#x27;s sports team and the only girl there constantly complains about the boys calling her names. Here&#x27;s the thing: the boys call each other names and fart on their faces too. What should I be doing? I told her parents that I don&#x27;t think I should baby her and over the period of a few weeks, she actually became more confident to the point where she was a star player in a recent game.<p>Before anyone chides me for being off-topic, the reason I say this is to explain why my opinions are the way they are.<p>So, can we hear from women who are actually IN TECH, who are provably competent (link to github?) and who can demonstrate that they experience discrimination? Because, so far, all I&#x27;ve heard is speculation from journalists and eavesdropping evangelists who can&#x27;t take a joke. I remember being quite impressed with a security hacker who has been posted here before and I did not see any blog posts by her bemoaning discrimination.<p>I have a vested interest in getting at the truth, for reasons I hope are obvious. I want my daughter to be happy in tech and if she won&#x27;t be, then I need to help her find something else she enjoys!",1393870652

Prejudices and handicaps limiting the disadvantaged (in this case, prejudices against women who negotiate) are considered to be unchangeable facts of life; correcting those prejudices is not even considered.<p>I think that instead of disallowing negotiation at all, we could look to university job courses (the ones that currently teach resume and interviewing skills) to teach negotiation skills and techniques.  It would  be something that <i>any</i> student could find valuable.  Not only would it make young people entering the job market more comfortable with the idea of negotiation, but it would make people on the company side of things more familiar and comfortable with the notion of women negotiating (correcting that prejudice, instead of accepting/ignoring it as the Bergeron-solution does).<p>If that proves unsuccessful, then less &quot;personal&quot; negotiation processes could be explored before the idea of negotiation was written off entirely.  Perhaps sending a form letter with every offer letter saying something along the lines of <i>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry but I have to decline [position] because I&#x27;ve received a better offer of [$] from [company]&quot;</i> could work.

Only to look and see yet another (VERY COMMENDABLE)but &quot;charity like&quot; donation.<p>In general, you do not see VCs from the west investing in African startups. That door is almost always closed. When they do it has to be under the category of impact investment and/or a &quot;social enterprise&quot;<p>Why do you think this is so?<p>Two years before the WhatApp acquisition, a Ghanaian startup SAYA <a href=""https://www.saya.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.saya.im/</a> came for disrupt but they could not get any funding. Even with  hundred thousands waiting signups. Almost like they were not worthy to tackle high tech.<p>I am very certain that if these guys had built an SMS app to remind farmers of prices in the market (or something along that line) they would have got funding.<p>Thankfully, things are changing a bit as Dropifi <a href=""http://www.dropifi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dropifi.com/</a> (from Ghana) got funding from 500 Startups.<p>PS: I want to make it clear that what you are doing is very worthy and commendable and this is not meant to be a criticism of you or this action in ANY way.<p>PPS: I will be in SF from Wed-Sunday this week  and would be very happy to chat with people who want to learn about the tech scene in Nigeria (yes and that includes &#x27;Nigerian scams&#x27; et al :)).<p>Oh. I also do not mind surfing on your couch if available too :). You will be paid in Nigerian beer (I brought some).<p>my email is in my profile.",1393869673

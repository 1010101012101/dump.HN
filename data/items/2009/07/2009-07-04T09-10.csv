687052,comment,686953,687010,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"I might have a unique insight here, as a CS Major/Software Engineering Minor, but if there's a personality difference between the average high school athlete and the C-level executives that actually run this town, I haven't seen or heard about it yet.<p>The ""jock personality"" is doing very well here.<p>The good news: jocks don't actually hate or even dislike nerds.  Teammates of mine played World of Warcraft, loved gaming, and participated in numerous nerd pursuits.  Throughout my football career I was deeply interested in Computer Science.<p>Nerds just need to figure out that the jock personality is actually useful, and figure out how to use it.",1246700189

There's no such theoretical underpinning to object databases.</i><p>True, the relational architecture is moved to the object or code level, if you think about it in relation to size, it makes more sense there for the future.<p>The RDBMS was the brain but it is also the storage, code will now dictate how to use the storage and not the storage itself, the storage is becoming a component.",1246700132

There are tons of projects just getting into beta and no doubt they took many man hours to create; yet if the text on the homepage does not entice me in the 4 seconds I give it, I'm pretty much gone for good. No disrespect to the code, the coders, the concept, the vision, I just value my time <i>very</i> highly. Don't we all?",1246699867

687048,comment,686953,687000,0,0,christofd,,,"Agreed. Some of the smartest people I've met were actually quite athletic. The one does not exclude the other - most of our top students in high school (in Germany) were great athletes and are pursuing anything from theoretical physics to medicine.<p>I personally don't like hanging with a nerdy crowd, like sports and sports channels. However, intellectual pursuits are interesting as well. I kinda like the positive spirit that athletes quite often bring to the table.<p>My two cents.",1246699498

In my opinion, that's a classic freemium model to pull in the crowd by the free app, and later sell the (pro) paid app. AdMob reported that, this model really works to get traction to your paid app.",1246698662

We (I?) should probably make this a stand alone package (with the relevant tests from Django's test suite).",1246698232

63823,comment,63009,63820,0,0,davidw,,,"Sure, but there are a lot of fields that aren't really that competitive (where you simply hire cheap laborers who basically work about the same), and where the pressure to conform may be higher than the pressure to find an employee that is 2% better than the next guy.",1191624658

In any competitive field, employers are fairly limited in how 'racist' they can be in their hiring practices without setting themselves up for a fall.",1191624177
63819,comment,63009,63145,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I'm really having trouble following this. You're saying that your odds of success after getting an education are higher than before. But that, uh, getting an education makes it harder to start a startup. You see the contradiction.<p>Is this like saying ""If you're going to be a programmer, you'll do better to buy a computer. But if you buy a computer, you'll have to get money, which leaves you less time to be a programmer!""?",1191624081

63817,comment,63009,63287,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Shit. I thought death, disease, revolution, communism (read Acts), fascism (which was an attempt to revive Rome) and war all predated the Industrial Revolution. In fact, the actual research I've read (<a href=""http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker07/pinker07_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker07/pinker07_index.html</a>) demonstrates clearly that those are declining as we industrialize. But I'm sure you meant to cite your own source. I'm waiting.<p>"" You are speaking from a position of privilege and assume all share that privilege.""<p>Pleasant nonsense. Why should my status change the validity of my arguments? I have an idea -- let's ask a black high school dropout (<a href=""http://www.tsowell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tsowell.com/</a>) if he agrees with me! Then let's decide that an individual's 'privilege', whatever that means, isn't as important as making a reasonable argument backed by data.<p>""If you were right in your theory, the nation you live in (assuming you're American) wouldn't exist right now.""<p>If I were right in my theory that depriving people of freedom in order to force them to make decisions they're going to make anyway (at best!) is a bad idea? I don't see how my rightness would affect American politics. Do you mean that if more people agreed with me, the world would be different? Are you confusing my perscriptions and historical descriptions? Please clarify.",1191623695

63815,comment,63009,63231,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I've found that sometimes, people refuse to say exactly what they mean because it's so absurd. So they write vague, pleasant nonsense about how ""human rights trump economics."" What is that supposed to mean? Economics is the study of what people want and how they get it -- how can it be 'trumped' by one set of things people want. It's a malformed argument. I wondered if the commenter would explain exactly what he was trying to say.",1191623439

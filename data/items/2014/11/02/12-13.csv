The general opinion on the tablet seems good, though, and the thing in question is a Voyo A1 Mini. Mine is the newer, slightly cheaper/less powerful 5V-powered Z3735F variant (vs. 9V Z3735D), bought on Amazon.de - but you can get it cheaper from Chinese-device-focused sites, just watch out for import taxes and the like.",1414933021

Often manufacturers will report on devices as being sold once they&#x27;ve left the factory for the retail store, not when they are in a consumer&#x27;s hands. Because there is great incentive to report good sales, manufacturers will often negotiate around inventory so that a warehouse somewhere gets filled with devices.<p>These devices then sometimes sit in the channel waiting to be sold (sometimes for quite some time, depreciating in value) but if the device flops then the seller writes it off as a loss and they go to the clearance rack.<p>That&#x27;s why you can have amazing numbers for &#x27;sales&#x27; and then 3 months later the thing is a well-known dud.

We only have clusterings of symptoms, but know nothing about root causes. Certain chemicals seem to interact well with the symptoms, but again there is no known mechanism that fully explains the mechanism of action. There have been hypotheses that e.g. schizophrenia is explained by dopamine and depression by serotonin, but these have all proven to be too simplistic, because in many patients the levels of these neurotransmitters do change after taking medication, but the symptoms stay.<p>I should say I&#x27;m not at all anti-pharma. I just think that the marketing should be honest. It should be &quot;this addresses some of the symptoms&quot;, and not &quot;this corrects your imbalances&quot; because the scientific hypotheses about those imbalances have long been disproven.

He says that such people often need 180 days to get medications to work properly, and that the average psychiatric hospitalization is five days, after which families are usually on their own to deal with a medical condition that can be as complex as cancer.<p>Keeping someone in a hospital against their will is problematic from a human rights point of view.  It&#x27;s also very expensive, and it requires some rehab work when the person leaves hospital.  So while some people do need hospital and they have a right to a hospital place if that&#x27;s the most effective treatment it should be possible to treat most people in the community or with shorter than 180 day stays.<p>It&#x27;s baffling to me why US citizens tolerate the awful quality of mental health treatment in the US - where most mental health treatment is provided in prisons not hospitals; where only 3% of occupational therapists work within mental health settings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/Barton-cultural-hub/story-11893611-detail/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/Barton-cultural-hub/story...</a>",1414931534

Yet, when it comes to the mind we have little patience. Somehow, we expect people to get their act together. We label them lazy, unmotivated and indisciplined. A product of poor parenting. We get frustrated that they are not reaching their full potential. In a way, having ADHD in 2014 is like being Gay or having an interracial marriage in the 60s or 70s. Ignorant cynical judgmental people assume that you can will your way out of ADHD through discipline and will power.<p>2. ADHD does give you super powers:\nInsane creativity. The ability to think outside the box. The ability to make off the wall zany connections. Always looking for small advantages and using creativity to your advantage. I use mnemonics to remember things. I hired people overseas who follow up on everything I do. I built products that are on track to doing well. When I do succeed, people write it off as being lucky.<p>I wish I could write more. But I am actually supposed to be doing something else right now.",1414930848

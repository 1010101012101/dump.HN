It running out makes about as much sense as the humanity running out of hydrogen. Deposits economically extractable at present market prices will run out within a few decades. This doesn't mean we run out of phosphorus, it just means that the market price will rise until other extraction methods provide enough supply. It will not have to rise far, given just how <i>common</i> the element is.<p>> Now we are running out of ... energy<p>We are not running out of energy. Nuclear and solar each provides the capability to run for effectively forever -- fracking provides the short-term supply to build them out.<p>The idea of resource depletion is completely anachronistic. Today, we can produce or substitute absolutely everything we need, given input of common elements and energy. And we have sources of energy that do not depend on scarce resources.

Thankfully, the comic gave us a good method of generating passwords to an arbitrary strength, by increasing either the size of our alphabet (dictionary from which words are drawn) or length of our string (number of words), and shows how to calculate the resulting entropy.  As I've pointed out elsewhere, 5 words drawn from alphabetic entries in /usr/share/dict/words (over 62 thousand) is very nearly 80 bits strong, or stronger than a 13 character completely random base64 string (which is going to be quite substantially harder to remember).

5547367,comment,5546222,5546222,2,0,dave_sullivan,,,"I've noticed there seems to be two definitions of a solo founder.<p>1) Single hacker trying to build a business and the product at the same time by themselves.  They do everything, by themselves.<p>2) A business where there is a single founder with all the equity. They have employees and those employees are paid with currency.<p>In the case of 1, I think it's a very hard road. Most software is built by more than one person, and most businesses must involve more than one person. You can of course make pretty good money off of freelancing, but building a business around a product is tough. Of course, not impossible.<p>In the case of 2, you need to be willing to ""put your money where your mouth is"" because you'll need to pay people. And even then, if you see any success and want to grow faster, you probably won't be the only shareholder for long. Jeff Bezos started Amazon alone, but they're a public company now so there are lots of shareholders.  However, it is interesting to look at eg Sergei Brin's net worth as a ratio of Google's market cap versus the same for Bezos and Amazon.

Idiomatically you might write something like ""my_objs.map(&:to_s).map { |s| s.gsub(/\W\S/+, '') }.reject(&:blank?)"" - perhaps broken up into multiple lines - but you're allocating three arrays and re-allocating every string. And in real life you're probably doing more pre-processing steps which involve additional arrays and possibly additional string re-allocations.<p>You could switch to gsub! which does the non-word stripping in place, but it ""Performs the substitutions of String#gsub in place, returning str, or nil if no substitutions were performed"", so you're adding an extra conditional. And it's going to be harder to avoid re-constructing a bunch of arrays.<p>There's no intrinsic reason you couldn't have basic Ruby language APIs which let you write code which chains operations just as naturally and obviously, but don't wastefully re-allocate. Think of how ActiveRecord relations defer the actual SQL execution until it's unavoidable.<p>(Haskell-style laziness might solve the main issue above, but I've run into analogous unavoidable-allocation problems with Haskell. If I'm depth-first searching a board game state-tree I shouldn't have to re-allocate the whole state representation at each step, but it's pretty hard to avoid while writing elegant Haskell since modifying memory in-place has side-effects.)<p>I don't know Go, but maybe instead of talking about why people who still use Python or Ruby are or are not stupid, we can talk about what it gets right that other languages can adapt?",1365957818

""There is a steep positive slope in the numbers of battle deaths between 1816 and 1914 and a steep negative slope between 1945 and 1997."" [1]  Obviously, something happened in 1945 that changed everything.  This change can be almost entirely explained by the United States acquisition of nuclear weapons, and the subsequent policy decision in the United States with respect to war and isolationism.<p>Prior to WWII, US foreign policy was one of isolationism, where the United States largely ignored other nations politics and conflicts.  This policy is very cost effective as long as war is avoidable.  Unfortunately, neither WWI or WWII were, and both were massively costly.  In the wake of WWII isolationism was abandondoned, in part because the United States was the only nation with nuclear arms.  The United States decided to take an active role in stabilization, largely through the use of nuclear deterents to prevent interstate conflict between major powers, and smaller, more frequent ""stablization"" conflicts.<p>Evidence for this is first seen less than three years after WWII ended, with the Berlin blockade, where the Soviet Union attempted to force the west into giving up control of Berlin by blocking supply access.  This led to the delivery of 2,236,406 tons of supplies over 278,228 flights in eleven months (the Berlin airlift), which was enabled directly by the United States threat of Nuclear retaliation against the soviets. The United States publicly moved B-29 bombers to Britain to discourage the Soviet Union from interfering with the airlift.  Had this deterent not existed, it's entirely possible that the situation would have escelated.<p>Less than five years after WWII ended, with the outbreak of the Korean war, the pattern is reinforced.  Before the start of the war, the United States produced 120 MK-III ""Fat Man"" nuclear weapons yielding 18-49 Kt, and started production of MK-4 1-30 Kt bombs, of which it produced 550 by May 1951.  Interestingly, all of the Mk-III's were retired in 1950, and the MK-4's were retired in 1953 because the pace of development was so fast.  The US deployed additional B-29's to Britain, with bombs, to discourage the Soviet Union from entering the Korean War.  When the Chinese entered the war, MacArthur intended to deploy nuclear weapons against the Chinese, in part to distrupt supply lines with radioactive fallout, and planned to destroy China until it surrendered.  MacArthur also made clear that he intended to use nuclear weapons against China if they crossed the 38th parallel, and this was communicated to them.  MacArthur was relieved in part because of these plans, and his belief that the power to order the use of nuclear weapons was his, and not the President's.<p>Ridgway, MacArthur's replacement, was authorized to use nuclear weapons in the event of major air attacks originating from outside Korea, and china was directly notified of such.  The United States entered the war pre-emptively, then used the threat of nuclear weapons to prevent others from doing so, and to prevent the escaltion of the war.<p>It is not difficult to imagine that without these stabilizing actions either the Berlin airlift of the Korean war could have quickly escelated into World War 3.  In 1954, just after the Korean war, the first thermonuclear weapon (5-7Mt) was deployed, marking an end to interstate war between major powers.  The highest yielding thermonuclear weapon the US ever deployed, the 25 Mt Mk-41, entered service in 1960, but by that point, the line in the sand had already been drawn.<p>Since 1945 US policy has been clear, it will interfere in foreign affairs, using economic sanctions, conventional war and nuclear deterents to prevent costly large scale conflict.  The direct result of this has been stabilization, a long-term decline in war deaths, and the end of interstate war between major powers.  It will be interesting to see what happens as this strategy is abandoned as the survivors of WWII die off, and memory of why the US spends so much on its military fades.  Hopefully enough time has gone by that a return to hostilities seems unthinkable; no doubt if there is a return, major hostilities will be massively costly in terms of life, money, liberty, and safety.<p>1: The Declining Risk of Death in Battle

You're still thinking in terms of brute force attacks but actually dictionary attacks are more common as they rattle off the 'low hanging fruit' much quicker. The danger of using common words like Randall did is that they might be in the dictionary so get cracked even before the attacker attempts to brute force the remainder of the passwords from a stolen database. In fact around half of the passwords people pick are vulnerable to such attacks (i'm on my phone though so can't easily cite a reference (I'm out of town this weekend) but it averages at either 40% or 60% of passwords use ""guessable"" / common terms)<p>If Randall has thrown in some punctuation and numbers then he's reducing the odds of that password being cracked.

Some guy I was chatting with at happy hour does research in remote sensing in the ionosphere, and was telling me about certain characteristics that the ionosphere imparts to signals from satellites. I had no idea of this, but together we worked out an interesting collaboration on a ""tangential"" bit of work - using the electron density on the transmission path to help authenticate signals.

In many mammals the selection is clearly for winners of dominance fights who collect harems.  We clearly don't do that.  Our closest relatives, chimpanzees, have a lot of selection for sperm production.  We don't do that either.  If we don't behave like these close relatives, then why would one assume that we behave like bower birds?",1251870986

I think 99% of the people on earth would be in favor of camera setups like this if there was some way to guarantee it would only be used to catch murderers and rapists.  But it's a slippery slope and once you put that power in the Government's hands they will almost certainly abuse it.<p>You're probably right about the cameras being a permanent fixture in London.  But the fact that Government officials are using them more for minor infractions than serious crime  is a lesson that may prevent setups like this in other places.",1251870827

799530,comment,798794,799131,0,0,hristov,,,"Not sure about that metaphor. I don't know much about the railroad's pricing but it seems to me what did them in was that the government decided to subsidize their competitor. The government poured trillions of dollars into highways and there just wasn't much the railroads could do. The railroad is actually more efficient than the road so it is a very bad metaphor for a paper newspaper. Of course that did not matter once the government started making roads and offering them for free to all car owners.",1251869341

The project stagnated with serious issues that were not fixed. Maintainership was then acquired, the project became OpenLDAP, and it remains highly successful to this day under a liberal BSD-like license, and is even incorporated into commercial products like Apple's Open Directory?<p>Same original maintainer (umich), same open source maintenance abandonment, better outcome (incredibly widespread use and active development), different license (liberal).",1251869124

Nor did I say that the age at which children make certain transitions is fixed in stone.  Nor would I try to imply that Piaget discovered everything about the subject.  Nor did I try to indicate that there are not gifted children.<p>However I stand by my claim that Piaget's work provides a framework to understand why a young child's ability at one task (sorting lines by length and objects by weight) is indicative of a much broader range of cognitive skills.  Furthermore the fact that cognitive abilities go through periods of rapid advance over a broad range of areas makes it less surprising to me that you see fairly large shifts in where children stand relative to each other in ability.",1251869032

If many criminals are not ""professionals"", then CCTV could dramatically reduce crimes of opportunity if it does act as deterrent.<p>To analyze it right, I'd want to see if petty theft and other crimes of opportunity were reduced, rather than crimes like street brawling.

""The project reached full maturity with years of development under the BSD license!""<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. Absolutely wrong. You said that Netatalk in its UMich days was ""once successful"" and ""fully mature,"" and that its previous users didn't need to maintain it anymore. Neither of those assertions are true.<p>Fully mature? Reference my earlier post on CNIDs (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=799429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=799429</a>), but there were grave data-loss and severe locking bugs in Netatalk which persisted from as far back in its BSD heyday as I can recall. In addition, the build scripts were all kinds of broken, and enabling a basic security feature like DHX was sometimes the subject of long web HOWTOs, due to how fraught the software was. Before the project came back to life, I recommended other options to my clients not because Netatalk's function wasn't necessary, but because Netatalk wasn't trustworthy. (Fortunately a few motivated developers wrote the CDB and DBD backends, and the problem disappeared.)<p>And the idea that its primary users didn't need to maintain it? Hogwash! Not only were many of the major storage vendors continually shipping it in their devices, but they were shipping privately maintained forks of it with fixes for the issues I mentioned. So it _was_ being maintained, but UMich's source tree was out of luck. The BSD license is why they didn't contribute the fixes back, because they didn't have to. And so Netatalk, always kinda broken, stayed kinda broken.<p>(Yes, Netatalk is pretty much the poster child for BSD projects which have been sorely neglected by their Fortune 500 users. IIRC, Quantum was the sole exception, but don't quote me on that.)<p>Now, it's reasonable to propose that if Netatalk had had a GPL license from the beginning, storage vendors might not have adopted it. But vendors ship tens of thousands of units every month running the GPL'd version, so it wouldn't hold water. In addition, there's no need to link to Netatalk in order to build an administration interface around it, something their developers and lawyers have surely always known.",1251868715

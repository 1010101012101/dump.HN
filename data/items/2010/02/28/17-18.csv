Movements were sharper and more direct.  Break bones, crush your enemy.  He did this frequently while in the Japanese military while serving in China as a bodyguard.<p>As he grew older, post-WWII, his philosophy and style became much softer and more spiritual than the styles he studied in his younger days.  This was due, in part, to his age (changing perspective and physical decline) and the influence of the Omoto-kyo.  In these later days, the purpose of training with weapons were twofold: help students learn body dynamics and learn to defend oneself against an armed attacker.  The purpose wasn't to be armed and gut your enemies, the purpose was to understand the mindset of an armed aggressor, know their movements, and meet their movements without being gutted yourself.",1267379860

In fact, Krugman argued, in a series of contemptuous articles in Foreign Affairs and elsewhere, countries were not at all like corporations. While another country’s success might injure our pride, it would not likely injure our wallets. Quite the opposite: it would be more likely to provide us with a bigger market for our products and send our consumers cheaper, better-made goods to buy. A trade surplus might be a sign of weakness, a trade deficit a sign of strength. And, anyway, a nation’s standard of living was determined almost entirely by its productivity—trade was just not that important.""<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/01/100301fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/01/100301fa_fact_...</a>",1267379856

Easy and safe such that everyone can do it. Perhaps it's not being brainwashed, but the net effect of all human interactions will ultimately be average, so it's important that anyone wishing to achieve better must work a little harder to get nudged above it.<p>This reminds me of the language blub (ironically in an essay titled, ""Beating the Averages""), except PG was very careful to prepare the reader for what he was about to say, ""I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.""

It was one of the most intense things I've ever done. If you are picking an Aikido dojo, look for one that teaches sword movements; otherwise you're not getting the full experience.<p>Aikido is frustrating because it might require 10 years to become good enough for it to be marginally useful in a fight. However, how often do you really get into fights? If you're an aikidoist, you've basically accepted that you're learning about a beautiful art form. If you want the most effective way to hurt someone, try Krav Maga.<p>If you are the sort of person who is attracted to complex, difficult ideas that make you re-evaluate everything, aikido may be for you.<p>Aikidoists also tend to be professionals. It is sometimes called a gentleman's martial art. (No offense to ladies.) You often encounter doctors and lawyers and artists so on. On the other hand, in any reasonable dojo, none of that matters.",1267379679

1157192,comment,1155903,1155933,0,0,aaronwall,,,"Thanks for recommending our site. :D<p>I think there will always be a career in SEO, but what that career looks like will change over time. Years ago it was tweaking page titles and meta tags. Page titles are still important, of course, but then links got added to the mix. And so then it was link trading. And then people figured links had value so it became about buying links. And then Google pushed hard to crack down on that and it became about how to buy links creatively and/or indirectly to maximize returns while minimizing risks. And Google has got more aggressive at folding query stream data into the relevancy algorithms, and they are working on a new infrastructure called Caffeine, which will allow them to fold even more data into the relevancy algorithms. As Google collects more data, eventually the distinction between SEO and marketing blurs as lots of SEO techniques will just parallel strong marketing principals.<p>As far as doing the consulting business model...its a hard business model to succeed at because it is a saturated market AND...<p>- some people excel at doing SEO<p>- others excel at selling SEO<p>the difference between the 2 is non-trivial...depending on what you are good at, (like if you are better at implementation than sales) you might do better as a publisher than as a service provider. and running your own sites lets you keep more of the profits recurring while also being able to test stuff that you might not want to test on a client website.<p>further, there are a few catch-22 situations with selling SEO services<p>- in many ways in the economic sense the SEO consulting market is a market for lemons<p><a href=""http://www.johnon.com/293/seo-consulting-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnon.com/293/seo-consulting-2.html</a><p>how this works, is people are told it is risky, so they invest little...and the investment is so small that they hire a scammer. the scammer takes their money and does nothing, and then they think the whole field of SEO is a scam, and are afraid to invest much with anyone else<p>- the biggest way to get around that market for lemons effect is to be well known and well branded so that people trust you a lot and are willing to pay extra to work with you specifically because they trust you. one of the best ways to do this is be socially active online, go to any offline events you can afford to and network (I got my first SEO conference pas for free for helping stuff all the programming things in the bag and hand them out to attendees), and write a blog. one more key here is that its hard to just try to own the keyword SEO <i>brutally hard</i> ... a better approach is to take a niche and try to own it. reelseo.com is doing video seo. David Mihm is doing local search. and so on. back when I got started I ran one of the first SEO blogs <i>and</i> I wrote an ebook back when it was common knowledge that all written books were out of date (and used that as my strategy in terms of reason for format delivery and product naming). some common niches that people target when starting out are doing stuff in their local area (makes sales easier as you can meet people face to face) and a particular vertical they want to have exposure in (say legal or automotive)<p>- as a consultant who does a really good job you rarely get to capture 1% of the value you create. even if you charge high 5 or low 6 figures for a project, you typically end up adding hundreds to thousands of times that much value to the company. and you still have to fight the in house legal teams to get stuff done (some what you to have x potential upside and limitless downside exposure).<p>- one last tricky thing is that if they don't have an in-house SEO they likely don't care enough about it to invest in having a consultant work on it. and if they do have an in-house team there is a fear/risk in the minds of some which sets a limit as to how much they can pay you before they worry about looking incompetent for hiring $x worth of external help when they already have an in-house team<p>- 2 more tips with consulting here...it tends to be a feast or famine business model...so again publishing your own websites is a great way to smooth out the peaks and valleys. also publishing your own websites lets you be more selective with who you are willing to take on as a consulting client. the 80/20 rule applies to SEO where the top few clients will be most of the income...so anything you can do to create some passive revenues to prevent you from taking on bad clients that won't produce any profits is a win.<p>- I could write on this topic for hours...but don't want to hog too many more pixels. let me know if you have any follow up questions.",1267378906

From what I know of the area, some hospitals had up to 80% community-acquired infections as opposed to hospital-acquired infections, this meant that the majority of these patients were being killed <i>by their families</i>. I know many ICU's in the UK have full out bans on any family members entering, because if anyone in an ICU catches MRSA they're gone.<p>It's easy to blame the healthcare providers, and I'm sure in many cases it is the healthcare providers' fault. However, if they simply flat-out banned people from visiting in the hospital MRSA infection rates (in good hospitals) would drop like a rock.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if hospitals with MRSA fatality rates over 20% allow visitors in the ICU and don't have well established visitor protocols in the regular hospital. I know some wards in the UK (I have friends and family who work in hospitals) will escort you out if they see you go between patients' beds; essentially they allow you to visit 1 person per day, and they frequently have visiting hours only a couple hours long so they can actively enforce this.<p>My advice to anyone visiting a friend in hospital, don't touch them.

If you look at the YSlow presentations, it is absolutely insane how much of a discrepancy there is between user-perceptible loading time caused by the back and and the front end, so if you get something to the front end as quickly as freaking possible, you get ""free"" time to continue crunching on the back end and update the skeletal response with minimal user-perceptible delay.<p>I get a lot of comments from my users that my site is SO FAST!!!1 because of this.  The site really isn't fast -- it is just responsive, which is something that is easy to mistake for fast.  For example, the quite misnamed ""live preview"" feature on one of the pages (which causes about 90% of my CPU load) creates a series of images which take ~2 seconds of CPU time each to spit out and pushes them to the user in response to user input, which makes it <i>feel</i> to most of my users like it is springy like a native application rather than a ""Type a bunch into a form then hit submit, watch an hourglass for a while then a page load, and finally see stuff"" that they expect on the web.",1267377209

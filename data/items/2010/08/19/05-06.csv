Napolitano is the former Democratic governor of Arizona who was put in place by Obama, so I think it's fair to criticize him here.<p>Bush did have issues with FOIA, though, but they were quite different from investigating the politics of people making requests.  Specifically, under Bush, agencies were supposed to deny as many requests as possible.  I don't believe Bush ever had the DHS looking into who was requesting what (at least, not that we know of).

I'll agree that building an economy on payments from the EU is bad. But now that that damage has been done, how exactly do you then make the jump to the concept that government expenses are an instance of not relying on yourself?<p>You're right, inflating the currency would help (if they weren't on the euro) but if you have high nationwide unemployment, the private sector isn't employing people, and they need to be employed to have health insurance, then the government should start paying these people to dig holes and fill them in again.",1282197027

This was not a rant about clojure, but about the article, yet you take my quotes out of their original context and make it seem like so.<p>> Not if you have a GIL.<p>Ok, fair point. But that's not the question. The OP was claiming functionnal programming made parallelization a breeze, which is a very stereotypical position you hear a lot lately. Well, the kind of parallelization which is made a breeze by FP is also the kind that is very easy, not in any language, but in any language claiming to have parallelization features, cf. delirium's answer.<p>> Yet far less tedious and simpler than writing a C module, or a C library binding<p>Okay, i was merely reacting to the claim that ""anything you can do in java you can do in clojure"". Which, for taking your comparison, would be like saying ""anything you can do in C you can do in Python"". Okay not exactly like that, but the fact remains. The impression the OP gives in this regard is that , since there is this java interop, the library problem is solved. Well no, it is not, and very far from it. If this kind of bullshit marketing talk went away, you'd see less newbies complaining in #clojure or on the group about how it's hard to do X.<p>> Uncle Bob taps into a community that's quite different from the language enthusiast crowd of HN.<p>But i'm commenting on HN, not on his blog. This is for a reason. I'm judging the interrest of the article relatively to the crowd here.<p>On a side note, i did not even notice it was Uncle Bob. If i had, my rant would have been even worse, or i would not had written it maybe. It does indeed exhibit the same emptyness i feel from every of his articles. Maybe it's a good article, and i'm overly critical, and i should probably try and write my own article about why i love clojure, to realize it's not necessarily that easy.

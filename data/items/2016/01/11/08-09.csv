He was the best, period, in my mind, and while he may not be in your mind, but his accomplishments and career are undeniable.<p>But every rock and pop singer today has something from Bowie. Kanye and Gaga found ways to navigate both pop stardom and the art world; bands like Of Montreal incorporated theatricality blended with musicianship in their records and live shows. I could list, so, so many more, from Janelle Monae to St Vincent, but unfortunately I think a list of every rock or pop musician since 1970 would take up significantly more room than I have in this comment box. They created something new using his life and music as inspiration - and that&#x27;s fine.<p>Because we like to act as if Bowie is this fount of perfect originality, ideas springing from the ether - and, don&#x27;t get me wrong, he certainly was inventive - but to ignore his influences is to create a myth. We talk about him as the chameleon, but he never morphed into truly untread ground - he always found what was there, and improved, innovated, found new ways to incorporate it. Young Americans followed Philadelphia soul. &quot;Blackout&quot; followed &quot;Nite Flights&quot;. The man operated a goddamn ISP in the late 90s, as another comment mentioned. Blackstar followed experimental jazz and had inspiration from everyone from Kendrick Lamar to James Murphy.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t dare to try to distill his life into a single takeaway, as there&#x27;s far, far too many angles to cover. But here&#x27;s the lesson that springs to mind first, which, now that I write it, comes out slightly more inspirational-poster than I&#x27;d like, but maybe that&#x27;s okay:<p>Creative work isn&#x27;t made in a vacuum, and to try is futile.

In fact I think it would be a great topic to have a poll about but first we&#x27;d need to agree on what to put in the poll :) Straw poll suggests that at least 50% say, &quot;stay the course but tweak knowledge&quot;.<p>Of the tech that the OP listed two things are _not_ hipster.js front end libraries or frameworks, and I wish I had mentioned them in my other response below.<p>1) Bootstrap: This is a huge productivity boost for CSS. You get a responsive layouts, a standard way to do grid layouts and it papers over browser differences and compensates for older browsers. OP says they don&#x27;t use much CSS, that really doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard in 2016. And, hey, Bootstrap is made by those guys at Twitter† (not 3 20-year-olds in a coffee shop as you so amusingly put it!) so they probably know a thing or two about UI layout and design. I&#x27;d be interested to know what % of websites now use Bootstrap or something inspired by it. Bootstrap was released as open-source in August 2011, it&#x27;ll be 5-years-old tech this year.<p>2) jQuery: This is a huge productivity boost for JS. Of course you can use that hipster tool Vanilla JS (<a href=""http://vanilla-js.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanilla-js.com/</a>) but jQuery is so concise, the syntax and semantics are well thought out, again papers over browser differences. You can chain operations together. The way it does selectors is brilliant. John Resig basically had some sort of divine inspiration. That fact that he was 14(?) at the time of writing it... well... that&#x27;s how one learns to be humble in life. Sure raw JS is going to blow jQuery out of the water perf-wise but going by what OP says, dev time is what we&#x27;re optimizing for here, jQuery will be plenty fast. It&#x27;s used* on what, ~ 70%..90% of websites? I&#x27;m surprised a version of it isn&#x27;t built into browsers yet. jQuery is 2006 tech, it&#x27;s a decade old this year. (Also released as open-source in August, hmm).<p>† and Angular is Google tech, React is Facebook tech, Rails is 37signals tech but all have have huge open-source communities.<p>* <a href=""http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript</a>",1452502395

I think that the population selling timeshares on their home, such as via Airbnb, are in different circumstances.<p>I also take issue with the label of &quot;serfs&quot;, because unless you&#x27;re an elite who works only for aesthetics or personal fulfillment, the rest of California must work to live. Everyone is serving somebody. Only a few elites in society get to collect rent on important life services or materials, which is the implication given by &quot;serf&quot;. The relationship between customers and drivers is surely not one described by serfdom.<p>The sharing economy is not the right lens to use for inquiring &quot;why are some people exploited?&quot;<p>If we assume (1) a generally free market where important life materials and services are provided for almost exclusively on the market, (2) that leverage matters in trade, (3) that advantage begets advantage, and that disadvantage begets disadvantage, and thus growing disparity is inherent to generally free markets, (4) that individuals and families begin accumulating debt from the start of life, then I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to see why exploitation occurs. These are factors, inherent to our market configuration, interacting with each other.<p>Uber and Lyft going away isn&#x27;t going to make life better for the generalist unspecialized (highly fungible) worker, and if it does, it&#x27;d only be a band-aid.

Regulations can only do so much for the fact that ride sharing workers lack leverage.<p>A union can also be a partial remedy to the leverage problem, which I would urge Uber, Lyft, and other workers do.

Thus, when trying to make a point, you <i>need</i> the hyperbole and absolutes—because even without them, people will still assume they&#x27;re there <i>anyway</i>, and &quot;temper&quot; your point into nothingness.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that <i>personal opinions</i> need to be expressed in such absolutist terms to have impact, though. When you&#x27;re giving your <i>opinion</i>, you&#x27;re just telling people where <i>you</i> are on the spectrum. A reader can pretty easily tell—usually from the different writing style—what&#x27;s rhetoric and what&#x27;s personal thought; and while people engage with (i.e. debate with) rhetoric, they <i>compare themselves to</i> opinion. When I say &quot;I think the sky is purple&quot;, that&#x27;s not an argument; that&#x27;s a way of letting you know that if <i>you</i> think the sky is purple too, you&#x27;ve got someone to discuss that with.<p>HN seems to really like anecdote-rich &quot;humble&quot; presentations of (opinionated!) personal experience, but the persuasive essay has an important place as well.

And although Folklore.org is certainly <i>entertaining</i>, I&#x27;ve never really seen a <i>productive</i> debate stem from a post there—certainly never anything that inspired someone to code up a new project to prove their point.",1452501564

I was talking mostly about the years 2005-2008 when IE had already won the browser wars and despite a new and better browser (Firefox in this case) already existed, users couldn&#x27;t switch to it (because ActiveX, because VML, ...) and developers couldn&#x27;t [care to] stop using IE-only stuff, because everyone was using IE anyway. The current Chrome situation is more or less the same now.<p>The non-updating users problem is a bit different. I guess it had quite a contribution to the problem discussed above (e.g. if Microsoft had a good mechanism to switch most of IE6 users to 7, they might have made 7 a better - less &quot;compatible&quot; - browser).<p>And Chrome&#x27;s great upgrade mechanism is one of the reasons I think the Chrome situation will be even harder to overcome. IE6 became so old and ridiculously bad that some sites stopped providing first-class user experience to it&#x27;s users, so that users had to do something - upgrade. The same think won&#x27;t probably happen to Chrome, because:<p>1. Google probably remembers Microsoft&#x27;s history and will try to avoid the same mistakes.<p>2. They have an automated mechanism to keep Chrome updated.<p>And as long as they keep gmail and facebook working great in Chrome (and - ideally - worse in every other browser), they are safe.<p>I guess this is even good for the users - uniformly good user experience on all devices.

If you want to learn how to lay out a page in CSS this is essential, but if you want to get up to speed just building stuff, then taking something like Twitter&#x27;s Bootstrap is a handy starting point.<p>Also, jQuery. Learn about using events properly, and keeping JavaScript in a separate file and hooking into the browser/document events you are interested in. jQuery is the starting point for getting your head around Unobtrusive JavaScript.<p>If you are interested in getting your head around static HTML/CSS sites first, it might be worth pulling up a Jekyll tutorial and following that.

Here for example, diminishing marginal utility doesn&#x27;t seem to play as big a part as it did.<p>My guess is that competitive dynamics dominate this issue. Within a career/job it is hard to progress with less than full effort because of competition, for example. On the consumption side, by working less an individual becomes poor relative to his peers. This in itself is meaningful. Where 4 kids in a small 2 bedroom was normal and middle class throughout Europe  in Keynes&#x27; time,  it is hardship today. Living without smartphones or Internet is hard because they are normal,  both psychologically and practically.<p>Second,  inflation is unevenly distributed.  The average salary/price ratio for bread and cheese and cutlery sets improved miraculously but the ratio for a tennis lesson did not.<p>Then, there are many markets that are zero sum or reduced sum. The price of real estate in many limited supply areas like cities rises to the limit of affordability for the corresponding percentile of the population.  IE the median house corresponds to the maximal borrowing amount for a median household.<p>I also think &quot;you make what you measure&quot; applies.  Our governments&#x27; highest measurable priorities are usually gdp and employment. Then there&#x27;s wealth distribution.  Will the median person&#x27;s wealth increase 8 fold?<p>All that said.

10879503,comment,10876864,10876864,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"One answer is that the market forces tend to funnel all increases in income to landowners as rent.<p>I was not familiar with this theory until a few days ago, when someone here on HN linked to an online version (edited and abridged) of Henry George&#x27;s <i>Progress and Poverty</i> [0].  I&#x27;ve been reading it since; its clarity is stunning: I feel as if a great veil has been lifted from my eyes.  Whether I&#x27;ll still feel that way in a few days, months, or years remains to be seen, but for the moment, Henry George has me eating out of the palm of his hand.<p>Whatever the general validity of his theory, it certainly seems to explain the SF Bay Area extremely well.  Salaries here sound incredible to people outside the area, but then it costs so much more to live here as to deny the wage earner much of the benefit.  Broadly, we can break the population into three groups.  Renters, obviously, have to pay the market rents, which seem to rise inexorably.  Those who bought houses here years ago, before the big increases in property values, and are still living in them, are the ones who can really enjoy the high salaries they can earn here.  Those who bought property here more recently, on the other hand, have large mortgages, because someone who <i>previously</i> owned the property made a pile of money when they sold it.  In effect, the mortgage is like rent being paid to whichever previous owner or owners saw the property appreciate.<p>George&#x27;s theory starts with Ricardo&#x27;s law of rent [1], which is a truism of classical economics (and another idea I was not aware of until just recently).  One could say it takes that law to its logical conclusion.<p>EDITED to add: while George&#x27;s theory has not been fully embraced by mainstream economics, it hasn&#x27;t been completely rejected by any means.  Joseph Stiglitz, Herbert Simon, and to some extent Milton Friedman are some of its adherents, and Hayek credits George with awakening his interest in economics.

10879500,comment,10877810,10879327,0,0,quanticle,,,">And now we&#x27;ve got us into another IE6 situation and I think it will be even harder to overcome this time.<p>I hate to defend Chrome, but I don&#x27;t think that comparing Chrome to IE6 is warranted (yet). The problem with IE was that a large number of users were stuck with IE6 and never updated (either by their own choice or their IT departments&#x27;). So web developers had to write code for modern web browsers, and then implement a compatibility layer (I guess we call it polyfill, these days) for IE6. Chrome, however, has an update mechanism that the vast majority of users and IT departments do not override. Chrome is not in an IE6 situation because historically the number of users running old versions of Chrome is small and drops off rapidly as new versions come out.<p>I pulled these graphs from a few years ago, comparing Chrome adoption to IE adoption:<p><a href=""http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chrome-adoption-2012-09.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chrome...</a><p><a href=""http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/internet-explorer-adoption-2012-09.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/intern...</a><p>Notice that Chrome uptake is very rapid, with the vast majority of users being on the current version of Chrome after approximately two to three months. Compare that with IE, where the majority of users still aren&#x27;t using the most modern version of Internet Explorer after two to three <i>years</i>.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think Chrome is in the same position as IE. Google pushes updates to Chrome on a frequent basis, and, more importantly, those updates are actually applied by users. That said, it&#x27;s still possible that Google could tomorrow do what Microsoft did when IE &quot;won the browser war&quot;, which is disband the team and cease Chrome development. Do I think this is a likely scenario? Of course not. Is it possible? Sure.",1452499430

The object invariants must be true when control leaves the object by exiting any public function.  Nothing outside the object must be able to alter the variables involved in the object invariant. Only one execution thread can be in the object at a time.\nIf you can demonstrate all of those conditions, assuming the invariant is true at entry to the object, you have proved the object invariant.<p>This is a useful and well-understood concept in the proof world, but isn&#x27;t seen much in programming languages.",1452499347

You can put in a template LISP command and tell it where you want a 2d point, or a distance and the GUI collects these and fills in the values. It can even do embedded calls to generate these from other things.<p>It&#x27;s extremely flexible and allows you to arbitrarily build new commands that are easy to use. I automated a workflow for a drafting studio I worked at in 1989 and reduced the time taken to complete a drawing from three days to three hours just by writing new LISP commands for all of the most common things we did and wiring them up to the menu on the tablets we had.",1452499324

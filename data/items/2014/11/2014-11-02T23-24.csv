8548674,comment,8548163,8548163,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"I used to commute between Manhattan to Stamford. A 5AM train would take me up and an 8, 9 or 10PM would haul me back. Staying awake for the duration of the return journey was rare. This led to curiosities: going to sleep in Stamford and waking up, four hours later, in Stamford again (Sartre had nothing on this fate) because you slept through arriving and then re-departing from Grand Central. Or waking up phoneless.<p>I lost my phone a few times. I have a habit of lolling over when dozing on trains. This encourages my polished iPhone to slip out. The Metro-North line tours a wide socioeconomic spectrum. I understand the temptation I was taunting some of my fellow passengers with.<p>Most of the time the opportunists were savvy enough to turn off the radio. Not always. Once I saw my phone blinking in from Rye. I stopped at their police station and showed the officer my iPad. Without question, we were on our way. The address I pinpointed resulted in a mother subjecting her son to an Inquisition. Nothing came of it. We apologised. Copper suggested we try the house across the street. Embarrassed from the last encounter, I demurred. He walked up to the door.<p>A young man answered and yes: he had an iPhone. A few minutes later, I was (mentally) $650 richer. (I went back to the lady at the first house with a bottle of wine and the local bookstore&#x27;s encyclopaedia of steamships—he had boat models in his room).<p>New York City and State get a lot of shit for our police forces. And yes, we have a high frequency of idiocy. But swinging the other way, towards ineffectual policing—as Seattle appears to have—doesn&#x27;t create strong societies. +1 New York.",1414972773

I sold it recently and am waiting to receive a 13&quot; Macbook Pro because I needed more RAM and space.<p>The biggest issues I&#x27;ve had with Windows laptops are:
 a) Trackpad is usually horrible. Some of the laptops use a rubber like texture that feels like I&#x27;m scraping my finger along a really rough surface.
 b) Battery life is never as good as the manufacturer claims. It is usually much much worse.
 c) Updating to a new version of Windows is a gamble. Sometimes you can find all the drivers, other times you get old ones which kind of work (or not at all). Either way it is frustrating to have to hunt them down.
 d) Support from manufacturers is AWFUL. The only exception I can think of is Dell. They have been pretty good but I&#x27;m not sure if they have worldwide warranty. I can take my Macbook to an Apple store basically anywhere and have it fixed.<p>There are many other small things that add up over time. It&#x27;s just not even worth it to save a bit of money.

My hosting provider will host email for any domain (presumably works like pawnmail...) and it doesn&#x27;t cost any extra.

The kind of introspection I&#x27;m thinking of seems to run counter to the strict correctness and isolation principles espoused by Rust.<p>>garbage collection<p>This would be implemented using a custom wrapper type. I think it&#x27;s in the works. However, the need for GC is mostly obviated by the statically checked lifetime system.<p>>Also, how does Rust compare to other modern languages, like Scala?<p>Rust, obviously, does not run on the JVM.<p>The type system is similarly rich, although (being HM-based) does not support subtyping (instead opting for the interface/typeclass/trait-only approach used by e.g. Haskell). The most obvious improvement over Scala is substantially improved type inference.<p>Scala absolutely requires heavy heap usage and GC. Rust requires no heap usage and absolutely no GC. All that stuff is determined at compile time, which is great for determinism and performance. The downside is that it requires some more effort from the programmer to think about lifetimes and such.<p>Rust has a substantially lower-level focus than languages like Scala or Haskell. It aims to be a C(++) replacement, not a Java replacement.",1414971954

As a completely different example of the same decision being rational, let&#x27;s remember when Tarsnap wasn&#x27;t accepting Canadian customers (despite a presumably sizable potential market) because dealing with Canadian sales tax law was too much overhead. Even if the path to accepting money legally is clear and well-documented, it still might not be worth it.<p>Not to mention I&#x27;ve heard stories of developers whose motivation to work on open-source projects has gone _down_ since getting paid, since it makes it seem like work instead of a hobby.<p>There is a worldview that seems to me to be prevalent in the cryptocurrency community (I don&#x27;t know which direction causation runs, but there&#x27;s certainly a bit of correlation) that everyone wants micropayments and microtips -- cf. the tip bots on Reddit. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see the tipbots get downvoted, and the tippers to be completely confused why someone might think it unwanted or off-topic.

No, they won&#x27;t arrest criminals, even after you have tracked down the criminals yourself. The government needs expanded powers so it can spy on you, not the criminal<p>Surely it&#x27;s possible to use the same database collecting info on Patriot Act violations to sift through and report on petty crimes also, even predict where and to/by whom they might happen? If the police won&#x27;t do it then surely there&#x27;s someone out there who could hack into the machines running the algorithms for such terrorism and high profile crime prediction to do the same for car breakins?",1414969460

For a normal person, the cost of starting to file taxes (and investigating how it needs to be done) it&#x27;s orders of magnitude larger than any reasonable amount of tips - generally, hiring an accountant would be cheaper&safer than doing it yourself and any non-standard income less than the accountant fee is not worth the hassle.<p>2) Those tips are strictly different from personal gifts - they&#x27;re payment (voluntary, but still) for stuff you did, so tax wise, they would be considered equivalent to commercial export of software. Taxes on international commerce are tricky (e.g., determining if value added tax applies in this case, etc), most jurisdictions have some simplified paperwork, guides and assistance for small business with the expectation that they&#x27;re domestic, not international.<p>3) If you&#x27;re asking &quot;which <i>specific</i> law prohibits&quot; - it&#x27;s entirely opposite, it&#x27;s not like there are specific laws for each taxable thing - the general law mandates that <i>any and all</i> income is declarable and taxable, and then there are <i>specific</i> laws to make exceptions for things such as birthday gifts from relatives or tips for waiters.",1414969415

While Giuliani&#x27;s &quot;broken windows&quot; theory was probably overshadowed by the fading of crack and the clarification of gang territory, it seems pretty conclusive that enforcing minor crimes leads to keeping felons off the streets. Enforcing subway turnstiles led to the capture of a TON of gun-carrying felons that would have otherwise gone on to rob, rape, and murder New Yorkers.<p>Unfortunately, liberals have somehow seized upon such measures as fascist. My parent comment has received at least five downvotes, for nothing more than saying cops are people too. Stop-and-frisk measures in New York, which were enormously valuable in stopping felons from their next murders, have become persona non grata since black people are disproportionately like to be found breaking parole, carrying weapons, or transporting drugs.<p>I consider myself liberal, but I&#x27;m really disappointed by our kneejerk responses to crime prevention.

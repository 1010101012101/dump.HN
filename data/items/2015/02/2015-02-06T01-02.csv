9007361,comment,9001618,9004412,0,0,mrry,,,"I think in its current form, COST simply provides a reality check: for some problems, a given system may be completely inappropriate when a simple single-machine implementation exists. Along with raising standards for distributed systems evaluation, I hope that it encourages people to innovate on the single-machine implementations: for example, the GAS idea in PowerGraph [1] is an antecedent of the Hilbert-curve implementation in Frank&#x27;s first blog post, and it would have been great if the original GAS implementation were separable from the particular distributed system for which it was built.<p>I fantasize about this work inspiring a competition like the sort benchmark [2], but for single-threaded graph algorithms. Not only would this encourage people to develop usable single-threaded implementations, but it have the side effect of increasing the COST for all distributed implementations....<p>As for providing scalability break points, I think this work goes some of the way, but doesn&#x27;t take into account the fact that the input data for a particular real-world computation might not reside in a conveniently-compressed format on a local SSD. Extracting the Common Crawl from an HDFS cluster just to replicate the blog post&#x27;s experiments could take much longer than the computation itself; extracting the social graph from Facebook&#x27;s Tao [3] to do offline processing might be similarly non-trivial. Academic experiments don&#x27;t typically take this cost into account, but recent work like Musketeer [4] has started to consider it, and even offer ways to automate the system choice problem.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi12/technical-sessions/presentation/gonzalez"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi12/technical-sessions/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sortbenchmark.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sortbenchmark.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc13/technical-sessions/presentation/bronson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc13/technical-sessions/p...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/camsas/musketeer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/camsas/musketeer/</a>",1423187682

9007331,comment,9007151,9007151,0,0,dalke,,,"You have mixed two ways to &quot;ask a question.&quot; A search query against Google is one way to ask a question. Stack Overflow supports the same method, through the search box in the upper right hand corner.<p>In both cases you are free to ask the same question many times per day, though I suspect in both cases if you automate it and ask it once every second then you might get throttled or shut off. This is possible because the machine costs to answer this sort of question is low.<p>Stack Overflow also has a way to post a new question, which may have supporting documentation, etc. Google does not have a way to ask that sort of question, in part no doubt because it requires human understanding to answer that type of question.<p>It&#x27;s not useful to treat both ways of asking a question as being identical.<p>Stack Overflow depends on a lot of volunteer labor. These are people who would rather not answer the same question over and over again. It&#x27;s possible to pay people to do tedious work, but that would likely be too expensive for their business model.<p>When I was a kid, before Google Search, there were automated systems like time and temperature; a free number to call which would report the time. There was no limit to how often someone could call it. NASA also had a free number to see when the next launch would be, also answered by machine. And of course even further back still, church clocks are a machine resource so people can tell the time. It&#x27;s acceptable for someone to look at a timepiece every few minutes, but not to ask people for the time at that same frequency.<p>It comes down to that we treat machines as mindless, unfeeling automata.

I&#x27;ll repeat what I said in my blog post here.<p>Branding vulnerabilities accomplishes two things, both of which are bad for the security community and the broader tech community:<p>1. It implicitly establishes vulnerabilities as severe if they are widely reported on. Getting media attention does not necessarily mean a vulnerability is serious. It means you have content that will generate views. I’ve been in the press twice for vulnerabilities found in widely used web applications – neither I or anyone who is even remotely familiar with security would claim that media attention elevates a vulnerability to the same level as Heartbleed. But the broader public doesn’t know this, and the media capitalizes on it.<p>2. It implicitly rates a vulnerability’s severity by how much attention and “buzz” it generates, not by how severe it is according to an objective scale. Yes, Heartbleed and Shellshock were severe. Did you know that all the vulnerabilities that received bounties from The Internet Bug Bounty Program were also severe? They didn’t receive media attention. They didn’t need to receive media attention – the normal process of responsible and coordinated disclosure is enough (and I’m willing to say that for extremely high-severity cases like Heartbleed, a brand may be warranted – but not for anything less).<p>Having widespread press attention via a logo and a name is just another noisy metric that will soon be added to the list of necessities for a vulnerability to have any credibility. Michal Zalewski and Project Zero find vulnerabilities on the scale of the so-called &quot;GHOST&quot; weekly. They are resolved without the need for panic or self-promotion.<p>This activity, like all fame seeking in the infosec industry, is encouraging a race to the bottom where people focus on the wrong things to decide is a vulnerability warrants attention. For every legitimate Heartbleed and Shellshock, there are the 20 vulnerabilities people try to brand put on the front page of Hacker News and /r/netsec.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://breakingbits.net/2015/01/27/your-vuln-does-not-need-a-brand/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breakingbits.net/2015/01/27/your-vuln-does-not-need-a...</a>",1423186187

Hopefully DBA&#x27;s for Mongo now have more experience, and the software has matured enough that this isn&#x27;t a common problem. - or more than it would be for any database.<p>Even then, you can only fall so far if you take regular backups, and have a fail-over & data recovery plan.<p>--------<p>&quot;SQL is hard&quot;:<p>I get your point - a lot of people don&#x27;t like or understand SQL. However, you seem to lump them with everyone who would appreciate an alternative interface.<p>Personally, I quite like SQL - some would call me an SQL-ninja. However, I don&#x27;t think we should be limited to SQL as the one-true-way for accessing data.<p>Sometimes these new &quot;NoSQL&quot; interface allows new technologies to emerge. For example, the reason MongoDB is being used with Meteor is two-fold:<p>1. Minimongo - A wholly javascript based mongo query engine. It would be a much harder engineering problem to build a similar tool for SQL / PostgreSQL.
2. Logical Replication - A Meteor instance is effectively a logical replica of the Mongo Database - only for &quot;live&quot; queries, which it interprets using (1)<p>(1) Means that queries/ their surrounding code can be isomorphic (same on client and server).
    To replicate this for SQL would be a huge engineering challenge. How would you even replicate complex joins etc?<p>(2) Logical replication was only made available in PostgreSQL 9.4 - but without a pluggable query interpreter [even for join-less queries], it still wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>----------<p>Relational Data:<p>Agreed, that data itself is best decomposed into fully-normalised form (Even up to 6th Normal form if you like temporal data). This allows for single-location, conflict-free and consistent updates/inserts/deletes.<p>But data usage is inherently document based - and the generation of those documents from fully normalised data, on huge data sets with complex relations, is a massive problem!<p>Until we have better tools for managing documents made of relational data - eg. PostgreSQL materialised views, but update only invalidated rows, -  there will still be a drive to store data (& maintain) in the format that it is read.",1423185470

If you think being gay is due even in part to environmental factors, then reparative therapy would have to be able to do <i>something</i> according to your hypothesis; however, it&#x27;s been shown to be completely ineffective, which is evidence for the &#x27;completely innate&#x27; hypothesis.<p><a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reparative_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reparative_therapy</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy</a>",1423185283

As your site states, concussion severity is very abstractly diagnosed without data, and your product can make a big difference. The doctor has a tough time deciding whether the athlete is fit to race if he&#x27;s had a crash and a concussion, and it ultimately comes down to a qualitative decision made by the rider and doctor. Data can definitely help save lives here.<p>If I have time for the track this season, I&#x27;ll definitely sign up as a tester. I&#x27;ve never had a concussion, but I sure as hell would want to know how fast my head decelerates after a crash before getting back on the bike.<p>Good luck, and cheers on a great idea.",1423184922

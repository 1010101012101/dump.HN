6886147,comment,6883589,6885661,1,0,robomartin,,,"Something like a Tesla has some 80+kW available at 500V.  This is very different from running an inverter off a 12V lead acid battery.  This is power at an entirely different scale.  As battery technology evolves I can easily see cars, and particularly trucks, having far more than 80 kW available.  A household with a couple of cars would, effectively, have a roving UPS that could provide lots of power during any time of need.<p>Heck, even a camping trip could change radically if surplus electrical power is available from your electric vehicle.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather cook my food with electric power at the campsite than burn wood or charcoal.  Over the last year or so I&#x27;ve convinced myself there&#x27;s very little you can do with a BBQ that you can&#x27;t do with a skillet and an oven.

6886082,comment,6885226,6885226,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Some reasons why this is becoming so:<p>Labor laws make it difficult for people in lower income tiers to climb up the income ladder. It&#x27;s difficult for people who are working less than fulltime jobs to work more hours because of the &quot;40hr = benefits&quot; laws, so instead folks have to work multiple jobs which adds transportation costs and scheduling complexities. The preponderance of regulations and complex taxes has made it more difficult to start many types of companies as an individual, putting them out of reach of folks who don&#x27;t have significant savings and existing income.<p>Public education is no longer as much of a guarantor of basic literacy as it once was, so college education is increasingly becoming a necessary credential for many office work, knowledge work, and &quot;professional&quot; jobs, putting those out of the reach of many low income folks who are put off by taking on so much student loan debt or can&#x27;t afford to support themselves and put themselves through college at the same time.<p>Similarly, anti-blue-collar sentiment has grown, devaluing such jobs culturally and discouraging people from pursuing such positions, even though many are well paying and can serve as spring boards to even higher paying jobs (e.g. self-employment). Moreover, the reduction in vocational training, shop classes, and so forth in public schooling has pushed a lot of those jobs even farther away from the average American adult.<p>The War on Drugs: which impacts lower income, blue-collar, and non-white people more. If you get caught with weed as a sub-urban white teen you&#x27;ll face different consequences than if you&#x27;re an inner-city black teen.<p>Some of these trends will hopefully turn around, especially with the help of the internet in terms of education, crowd funding, and so forth, but it&#x27;s still going to be a pretty difficult problem for some time.",1386740248

Then, when the Nest is booting up, go into Settings and disconnect the Nest from the Internet so it doesn&#x27;t try to software update endlessly.  That has worked and we thankfully have heat again.

From Wikipedia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula</a>):<p>&quot;In mathematics, Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a central statement in complex analysis. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy&#x27;s formula shows that, in complex analysis, &quot;differentiation is equivalent to integration&quot;: complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result denied in real analysis.&quot;<p>Does anyone who knows this stuff better than me know if there&#x27;s any meaningful connection?",1386739807

6885993,comment,6885321,6885596,3,0,veemjeem,,,"I don&#x27;t think decrim feeds crime syndicates.  California has had decrim for cannabis for a long while now.  Dealers can&#x27;t really make money selling cannabis because it&#x27;s already so cheap at dispensaries.  Most of these dealers move to states where cannabis is still illegal.  In a way, dealers are not monetizing &quot;drugs&quot; -- they are monetizing security.<p>Cannabis is extremely cheap to manufacture since anyone with a bag of soil can easily grow several thousand dollars worth of plant material.  The real cost is in securing the product and transporting it to the customer.  In states that have decrim, the police don&#x27;t even bother arresting people with cannabis because catching people running stop signs actually yield more money for the police department.  There&#x27;s no money to be made transporting the goods because the risk is so low.",1386738204

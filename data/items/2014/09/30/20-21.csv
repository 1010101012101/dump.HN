GHC does this for Haskell but the Ocaml guys don&#x27;t because they highly value keeping the compiler as simple as possible.<p>I&#x27;m unclear on how special-casing integers and foisting a lot of bit-twiddling on all integer operations makes the compiler <i>less</i> complicated. Treating all values uniformly and using machine arithmetic everywhere would seem to minimize compiler complexity and make things faster.<p>> By the way, integer tagging is only important if your code s heavy in arithmetic operations or floating point operations (Ocaml tries to unbox floating point arrays, but sometimes it has to box floats). This often not that big of a problem and in the worst case you can always link Ocaml with C if you really want to.<p>Noted: if you want to do numerical work in OCaml, use C ;-)<p>But seriously, is there code that isn&#x27;t heavy on integer arithmetic or floating point operations?

8391039,comment,8389728,8389728,2,0,jrapdx3,,,"A very interesting article.  While the idea of using scripting to extend OS functionality has been around for a long time, surprisingly few attempts have been made to implement it.<p>Of the potential uses, an OS built-in webserver would be especially appealing.  Many scripting languages provide tcp server/client APIs so it doesn&#x27;t seem too much of a stretch to embed this functionality in a kernel.  For example, Tcl&#x27;s &quot;socket&quot; core command makes it very easy to set up a tcp server or client.<p>If performance or security is an issue, some interpreted languages can also be compiled to native code.  There are Scheme implementations that are embeddable in C and can load interpreted or compiled modules.<p>One thing I didn&#x27;t completely grasp is the distinction of &quot;embedding&quot; vs. &quot;extending&quot;.  Are these really disjoint ideas?  I found this puzzling:<p>&quot;... Extension scripts are loaded into instances of a <i>kernel-embedded</i> Tcl interpreter that execute in independent system processes [22]. A set of extension bindings exposes to the scripts the necessary resources for extending the kernel. What distinguishes our approach from [micro]Choices is our support of scripting by <i>embedding</i> the language interpreter, in addition to scripting by <i>extending</i> it.&quot;  [emphasis is mine]<p>On the whole, the idea seems familiar and sensible where sane security policies and safety constraints are applied to actions of the embedded scripting language.",1412109637

8391032,comment,8386649,8387981,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> <i>Never seen any tobacco ad with children smoking.</i><p>It&#x27;s more subtle than that.  Most of the marketing is underhanded.  You can see it in movies.  When did you last see a film depicting a negative aspect of smoking?  Cancer, bad smell, addiction…  I personally can only recall one, maybe two instances.  Most of the time, smoking is the reward after some heroic action, a sign of manliness, a classy move, a cool &quot;rebel attitude&quot;, or just no big deal.<p>The studies about that are terrifying.  Those films have the power to multiply the likelihood of a kid becoming a smoker by at least <i>three</i>.  And I&#x27;m talking about kids who <i>already</i> have a smoker&#x27;s environment (parents, friends…).  For those who don&#x27;t live in an otherwise smoking environment, the multiplier is <i>ten</i>. (Presumably, the initial risk was much lower in the first place.)<p>So, you don&#x27;t want your kid to smoke?  Turn off the TV, or have <i>strict</i> control over what your kid watches.  Don&#x27;t smoke yourself, and don&#x27;t let people smoke in front of your kid.  You&#x27;ve got to admit, past some point, it&#x27;s just too much effort.  Past some point, collective action is required.  I think one of the first steps is to recognise that tobacco is an addictive drug.  That, like any other recreational drug, it should be used with <i>extreme</i> care.",1412109583

Lua is super easy to integrate... you can literally just throw Lua&#x27;s entire source code into your app[2] and it&#x27;ll compile just fine.<p>C. Lua&#x27;s C API is super easy to use, and way more thought-out than Python&#x27;s or Ruby&#x27;s (no offense to Matz or Guido) -- yes, it is stack-based, but this actually makes its API much simpler and smaller than it would otherwise be. You can probably learn all of it in an afternoon (with the right guide).<p>D. Lua is uncannily similar to JavaScript in semantics, and the syntax[3] is ridiculously simple to learn. Semantically, it has way less magic to learn than either Ruby or Python.<p>E. Lua isn&#x27;t only for scripting video games. I wish this &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; would just die. Yes, it is good for scripting video games, for the same reason it&#x27;s excellent for scripting anything.<p>F.

The same social pressures that lead to no defaults then, most likely apply now, even if the tech is slightly different.<p>&quot;a sub that&#x27;s supposed to be by and for women.&quot;<p>I lurked there and read a lot.  Interesting to see their opinions vs mine.  Eventually it got boring.  Encouraging half or more of the new user population to lurk before posting was another usenet thing.

(I wish that study had clarified whether they had surveyed an equal number of men and women.) That link amongst almost every you read regarding reading contracts and whatnot always advocate reading through word for word, and making sure you understand <i>everything.</i> Two things prohibit this - time and ease of comprehension. If companies could bullet point, we&#x27;d all be able to get through it within a reasonable amount of time. Those bullet points would hopefully simplify the language and make clear for those who cite &quot;difficult to understand&quot; as the reason for why they don&#x27;t read through terms and conditions. I imagine some might need to contact legal counsel for explanations every time they want to sign up for internet, use a new application, or even browse a website. These fees would be quite costly, and it is arguable that the total damages associated with failure to reading terms and conditions would not outweigh the expenditure for ensuring clarity and comprehension through legal counsel. However, despite the theoretical advocacy for thorough reading, companies do not actually want us to do this. If they did, I believe they would make it easier. Lawyers like convoluting things; they like leaving loopholes, and making language just abstruse and ill-constructed enough to deter even the most erudite from fully reading anything they&#x27;ve written. (I sound like I hate lawyers, but I don&#x27;t. I took the LSAT&#x27;s thinking maybe I would like to go to law school to learn that school of thought. But I digress…)<p>The article about the Londoners is just sad all around. Are they to blame? Are the companies writing these wandering tomes of terms and conditions?

Seriously? That&#x27;s a huge fallacy.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s all about the cost. When speaking of the NSA, we are primarily concerned with mass surveillance, because lets be honest, if you&#x27;re targeted directly then you don&#x27;t stand a chance, since they can always infiltrate your home then watch your fingers typing your password. And if these companies are raising the cost of doing mass surveillance, with encryption doing just that, then that&#x27;s a good thing. It is in their interest to do so because the bad press they are getting is hurting their bottom line - you may not see it, but post Snowden at least governments and big corporations are starting to think of software/hardware stacks provided by non-US companies and now they have the ultimate argument for the balkanization of the Internet, which can&#x27;t be a good thing.<p>But lets also think about things closer to home. I&#x27;m not from the US, I couldn&#x27;t care less about the NSA. But I do care about my personal data ending up in the wrong hands - personal emails and photos, details on my accounts, projects, written down feelings and so on.<p>There are always organized crime syndicates looking for generating a quick buck. There are always incompetent clerks in your government institutions that out of an oversized sense of responsibility are doing stupid things. For example my personal identification details ended up in a local newspaper by mistake, because of a non-public contract leaked out of a public institution. Now how can I trust these people to handle my data? How could I let any cop inspect my laptop or phone on the spot as part of routine checks, which from what I hear, are becoming more common?<p>Yeah, encryption is not a good solution in the face of insecure apps, binary blobs and a potent global adversary. Thing is, for most people that global adversary is not the immediate threat they are facing and even for that global adversary, encryption makes surveillance more expensive.",1412107539

You don&#x27;t get to take the format that a lot of projects are already using and declare that it now has your particular semantics.&quot;<p>No.  The major.minor.patch version format predates either semVer or Scala and Scala&#x27;s use of it may predate the codification of the semVer standard but most of that standard was very widely spread long before that.  Most importantly, the expectation that only additive changes would bump minor versions and breaking changes would be indicated by a major version change has been near universal for a very long time.<p>Scala to this day, breaks source compatibility with minor version bumps of the compiler.  That is not a natural interpretation.<p>Of course the industry doesn&#x27;t care about version numbers.  You could call it Scala Foo, then Scala Bar, then Scala Waz and no one would care in the least, but having expectations around and controls around source compatibility is very important to a certain segment of the development world and Scala has historically been very bad at that.<p>I think that Scala has gotten much better in this regard over time, but for a lot of its history it was bad at this.  This has made some people rightly leery of using it in projects with long time horizons.",1412107316

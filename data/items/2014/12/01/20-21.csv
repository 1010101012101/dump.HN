Some have expressed their concern that, as\n  Docker expands its scope, there may be less room for them to create differentiated, value-added\n  offerings. In some cases, these vendors want to create orchestration solution that are tailored for their\n  particular infrastructure or offerings, and do not welcome the notion of portability. In some cases, of\n  course, there are technical or philosophical differences. We hope to address some of the technical\n  arguments posed by the Rocket project in a subsequent post.</code></pre>",1417467521

8683735,comment,8683460,8683460,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"Unless I am just misunderstanding the article (entirely possible), the author poses the question: Do we need Node and then doesn&#x27;t really seem to answer the question (perhaps it is more of a theoretical question than an actual question). Nor does it address the claim that Node is baggage (in the third paragraph).<p>Honestly, Node doesn&#x27;t need and shouldn&#x27;t need to support other engines. I strongly believe that the ecosystem is too involved in Node for V8 to all of a sudden just stop being good enough not to mention Google Chrome which is extremely popular is based on V8 and always being improved. If Node doesn&#x27;t fit your use case, then maybe Node is not the right fit for your particular use case.<p>Sure, some developers might have niche requirements that Node cannot fill, but as I said, maybe that is a sign that you are trying to use a tool not fit for the job. You can nails into a piece of wood using a boot, but that does not make it the right tool for the job.<p>I and many other developers know what Node can do and what its limitations are. Instead of trying to change things, potentially resulting in a fragmented ecosystem, we can keep the one engine and ensure that things do not become too disjointed. One version of Node is better than multiple versions running different engines and other components that can be swapped out, sounds like an open source nightmare to me.<p>Once again, perhaps I lack the understanding here, but since when did Node not become good enough for the tasks it was created for? Changing an engine out just cause is not a good enough reason to go ditching arguably one of the best open source engines out there for Javascript.",1417467488

He starts out saying:<p>Let&#x27;s compute the square root of 677329.<p>We start by thinking of it as 67 x 10^4 + 7392.  That means the square root will be 800 and a bit (because the square root of 67 is 8 and a bit, and the square root of 10^4 is 100.)<p>How did he know to start with 67 x 10^4 + 7392 instead of 6 x 10^5 + 77392?  The Square root of 6 is a bit over 2, but obviously starting with this digit doesn&#x27;t get you the correct answer.  In the next step he works with 3 digits instead of two.

Docker brought competition to lxc. And now tools like lxd, rocket and nspawn are bringing competition to Docker.

If you&#x27;re going to compete, just compete!

Docker should ship a default, swappable implementation good enough for the 80% case<p>4) toolkit model. Whenever it doesn&#x27;t hurt the user experience, allow using one piece of the platform without the others.<p>5) Developers and Ops are equally important users.

If you don&#x27;t, we&#x27;ll support and help you :)<p>7) Protect the integrity of the project at all cost. No design decision in the project has EVER been driven by revenue.<p>8) Docker inc. in a nutshell: provide basic infrastructure, sell services which make the project more successful, not less.<p>9) Not everyone has a toaster, and not everyone gets power from a dam. But everyone has power outlets. Docker is the outlet<p>10) Docker follows the same hourglass architecture as the internet or unix. It&#x27;s the opposite of &quot;all things to all people&quot;<p>11) Anyone is free to try &quot;embrace, extend extinguish&quot; on Docker. But incentives are designed to make that a stupid decision<p>12) Docker&#x27;s scope and direction are constant.

It&#x27;s a bit rough to summarize several papers on this topic, e.g. there are several definitions for cultures, but this one fits the text. These solutions can be mediated and made to create synergies. So instead of proclaiming one global culture, it&#x27;s better to see the different cultures as they are and mediate in the 3rd space where two or more cultures meet.

It is the latency from browser to server, server processing, and latency coming back. And because of the difference between latency and our huge bandwidth connections, your browser spends most of its HTTP networking time waiting.<p>This is exactly where the &quot;SPDY vs HTTP&quot; factor comes in. With HTTP, you request each item, and wait for a response. This can only be done one item at a time[1] per HTTP/TCP connection, with a limit of 2-6 (depending on the browser) HTTP/TCP connections per unique hostname. As I mentioned in a comment below, this benchmark is using a single hostname, which is the worse possible situation for HTTP.<p>SPDY, or HTTP/2, instead using a single TCP connection, and multiplexes all the requests over it. In other words it can be downloading pieces of many other responses, all while waiting on other requests.<p>[1] - Yes, I am ignoring HTTP pipelining, because every other person who implemented a piece of HTTP software did as well.

The problem with subscription startups like chargebee, recurly, etc. is vendor lockin. Why lock the most fundamental part of your business into an unproven startup? That&#x27;s a hard bargain to drive, even if the charts are really pretty.<p>There&#x27;s no reason that Chargebee, Recurly could not be emulated in open source software. The solution to the saas problem is simply a nice API + dashboard, with pluggable billing backends. You should be able to swap merchant accounts seamlessly, since that&#x27;s the biggest point of failure.<p>What would be nice is a &quot;launch KillBill on digitalocean&quot; button (I think someone posted a Show HN like this recently?) so that you could launch your own service and start using it immediately.<p>More generally, I think a lot of SaaS startups are ripe for disruption from open source projects. However, many projects miss the mark of usability. What people need is a self-hosted, open source API that&#x27;s as usable as chargebee or recurly, for instance. This means that OSS should be targeting microservice architectures more often, instead of self contained solutions with a bunch of wiring required. I want to see more OSS projects that are structured as a standalone app server with an API and dashboard, so that you can self-host but still get the benefits of a composable API.<p>A good example of an open-source project leveraging &quot;microservice architecture&quot; for self hosted solutions is Seatgeek&#x27;s AB testing project, sixpack.

There are billions of consumers, all eager to spend money, and only 42% of them are on the Internet so far. Clearly Asia is an attractive market, but if you&#x27;ve never experienced Chinese culture then you will have no idea what the context of it looks like. You need to go see for yourself.<p>Much of this post resonated with me. Still, if you&#x27;ve only read the post, and not seen the culture, you are missing a lot. After a few weeks in Taiwan, a few things were very clear. Most notably, LINE is incredibly popular. It&#x27;s the dominant messaging app, ahead of even iMessage, MMS. People <i>love</i> the stickers, btw, and they pay for them!<p>Also, Taipei has a 7/11 on every corner, no joke. You can do all sorts of useful things at 7/11. You can pay your bills, pickup packages, order meals, and more. You can also use a refillable &quot;EZCard&quot; which is an RFID chip that works at many retail outlets as well as subway stations. In general, the 7/11&#x27;s in Taiwan make an effort to integrate as many products as they can into their economy. You&#x27;ll see a lot of offline (hah) LINE promotions, e.g. partnered with drink companies and 7/11.<p>It seems like in general, once users in Asia are entrenched in a service/network, they are fiercely loyal to it. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see users switching from LINE to other apps, and why certain Asian countries might prefer one paritcular messaging app over another.<p>What I miss most, though, is the unlimited 20mbps tethering with my $40/mo pay-as-you-go plan...<p>Oh, and here&#x27;s a prime example of how crazy loyal Chinese consumers are for their products.

I&#x27;d <i>love</i> a service that would auto-cache exactly the music I like to listen to so I could play it when roaming.<p>I&#x27;ve heard Spotify CAN cache, but it&#x27;s too expensive for my tastes. Something like a cacheable Pandora would be nice.<p>But my point is that while yes, it grants an edge to certain established businesses, it&#x27;s not an insurmountable barrier. Not like Comcast <i>throttling</i> Netflix; if you can&#x27;t use the service in its primary form, it&#x27;s DOA. And T-Mobile seems to be adding new services pretty quickly: Even indie stations like Radio Paradise are on the list.",1417464686

Your body naturally produces D3, and the latter is much more bioavailable. Because of this, you will also want to scale down your dose and not take as much. It&#x27;s possible to go too far and end up with hypervitaminosis, which ironically can also cause random bone pains, and calcification of your arteries.<p>It&#x27;s important to test your 25(OH)-D levels every few months when taking extreme supplements.<p>Also, be sure you are getting enough calcium <i>and</i> magnesium. These are the chemicals needed to maintain healthy bones. Doctors do not prescribe the magnesium, and large vitamin D supplements will deplete this, also leading to calcification and other problems.<p>Finally, for anyone living north of South Carolina, you will not receive enough UVB radiation from the sun to produce sufficient levels of vitamin D during the winter months, and milk really has very little vitamin D.

Then, when someone submits a signup form, the website can:<p>- Check if an account with the email exists, and if it does, whether the given password matches the existing one.<p>- If both are valid, log the user in, optionally showing a message saying “there was already an account with these credentials so we logged you in”<p>- If an account with the email does not exist, or if it exists and the password doesn’t match, return a message to the user saying “please check your email and follow the validation link”. The user can’t tell if the email exists or not.<p>In the backend:<p>- If the account did exist, send an email to the user saying “someone tried to sign up for an account with your email, please let us know if it was you. and here’s a way to reset your password if you forgot it”.<p>- If the account did not exist, send an email verification link, which then redirects to a page to complete the user signup<p>Same with password resets, the success message can always say &quot;check your email&quot;.<p>There are ways around revealing the username. But I agree, only doing this in the login page is useless.",1417464003

This means extra work for you. Also, you'll have to take care of an auto-upgrade mechanism.<p>On systems with a package manager, you'll only have to provide updates if you fix an issue in the application itself. You also don't have to write an auto-upgrade mechanism. Just upload a new package to your server.<p>However, if you don't care that much about users' security, statically linking is indeed a lot less work than using a package manager.<p>(FWIW, I'm the maintainer of Mingw-cross-env (<a href=""http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/</a>).

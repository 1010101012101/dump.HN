Though I still remember those times when C wasn't called a low-level language. But these days it goes like: ""C? No StringBuilder? No OOP? What are Pointers? Nah, I don't do Assembler.."". Proud to be a C coder.\nP.S. No offense, dynamic languages and high-level stuff are actually very good and save a lot of time. It's just that I'm in love with C all my life. Cheers.",1259654242

Also, most big websites end up having CSS in other places other than a central location driven by sass.

Logic is logic.  Its english grammar is a thin abstraction over its mathematical form, so I would be surprised if non-english-conceived programming languages would be dramatically different (aside from syntactic ordering perhaps).<p>Actually writing that sentence forced me to think of one such way a Japanese-inspired programming language might differ dramatically:  since the subject of each verb is often left unstated in conversational japanese, you might have primitives that set the current 'variable context' and then all messages after that yet before the next 'variable context' change would go to that variable.  something like:<p>foo(a, b, c){\n    talk_to(a)\n    bar(b, c)<p>bar would implicitly actually be bar(a,b,c) (or a.bar(b,c) if you prefer).<p>This example seems pointless, but there might be other worthwhile ones.",1259652107
969398,comment,968278,968278,0,0,Kliment,,,"Well, the LaTeX approach is one extreme, the Word approach is the other extreme. Pretty much everything that somehow fits in between tends to be mostly one or the other. What's really missing is a plausible middle ground. What makes Word so attractive is that you can open it and start typing, and you can format things as you think of them. That sort of control feels nice. For LaTeX, what attracts me to it is being able to not care about format. Knowing this is someone else's problem feels nice. What's really missing is the middle ground. How about something where you type in text and format at will, then apply styles to (that actually work and make it look nice, unlike Word styles) and then apply tweaks to in word processor mode? And no, LyX doesn't do this. It does both sides of the divide badly. The closest I could think of is Scribus and the like, but those lose on the ""just start typing"" side of things.",1259652075

The benefit of this approach is that it's exact so you don't need a certain number of samples to properly approximate a normal distribution.  The answer is that B is almost certainly better than A.

969392,comment,969322,969322,0,0,lmkg,,,"If you want a cup of approximately coffee-shaped liquid in the morning, Starbucks is great because it's the same coffee anywhere. It's not inspiring, but it's nearly always edible. For a very large number of people who drink coffee, this is the goal and starbucks delivers, anywhere, anytime.<p>If you want a coffee shop experience, with young bohemian college students or starving artists or something, starbucks tends not to deliver. Being standardized lends an air of inauthenticity, and depending on what you're looking for it's a bit too busy what with everyone ordering coffee all the time so they can get through the day. There's usually some people on a laptop, and there are a few that have managed to become havens to the right type of people, but it's less ""coffee shop"" and more ""a shop that sells coffee.""<p>So basically, starbucks is servicing a niche market. Fortunately for them, it's a large niche, and they've self-selected for high-functioning addicts so the business model is sustainable.",1259651803

This a concept originated from Smalltalk. It's super cool.<p>Lisp macros do something completely different: they let you extend the parser of the language. They <i>literally</i> let you write code that edits your code, at compile time, before anything is run. It's super cool, too, but in a very different way.<p>Here's a hig-level view:<p>1) You write code.<p>2) That code is <i>translated</i> to a data structure which is <i>interpreted</i> by a computer.<p>Lisp macros are ways of extending what the <i>translation</i> rules are.

969385,comment,968646,968646,0,0,tel,,,"Starbucks has always seemed self-defeating to me. The original goal was to introduce coffee art to a consumer culture that was, at the time, fixated on Folger's. They've succeeded in moving people to believe that there's a lot more to coffee which has seriously expanded the market for the kind of high-craft coffee possible at smaller, non-franchise shops. Today, Starbucks doesn't really have the brand to move into that niche, everyone knows their secret is just sugar and milk, so they need to stealthily make inroads.<p>Unfortunately, at the end of the day, franchise and craft don't go together that well.<p>I remember reading an article about a certain kind of highly engineered coffee maker. It combined the grinder, water heater, mixer, and press all into one and thus turned perfect coffee into an exactly repeatable formula. A trained operator can never fail to please and Starbucks bought the company hoping to put one of those devices in every franchise and revolutionize the availability of the ""perfect cup"".<p>In pilots the baristas still fill them with stale beans.",1259651436

969383,comment,968038,968819,0,0,roundsquare,,,"I agree that thinking algorithmically about things is a part of what divides techies from non-techies, but I think a part of that is what information an algorithm has access too.<p>This is what I think the author is saying.  With the TiVo example, techies know that the only information available is 1) when the show was recorded and 2) if there is some flag about saving on the show.  Take that information, and we quickly come up with the most natural algorithm (FIFO + check ""save till"" date).<p>I don't think the TiVo example is a good example though.  Here, the problem is the data to use exists, but isn't being populated.  The example with the picture is better.  Think about explaining how google images comes up with pictures.  Lots of people think its searching the contents of each image so when you search for ""Saddam Hussein"" it comes back with pictures of him.  In reality, its searching what the author calls ""meta data"" and just doing it extremely well.",1259651401

To give you an example, I traveled from South Africa to Zimbabwe via the Beitbridge border post last year and it was an absolute nightmare, taking nearly 8 hours just to get through the Zimbabwe side. Our party was flush with US dollars (they don&#x27;t take anything else), had all the paperwork and an infinite supply of patience. We could at least afford to pay the ridiculous &quot;fees&quot; and &quot;levies&quot; to get in. My workers? Not so much.<p>You are at the mercy of the staff at an African border post.

However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There were notable exceptions for certain subgroups. For black and Hispanic students and for students who come from less-educated families (in terms of their parents&#x27; education), the estimates of the return to college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for unobserved student characteristics. &quot;<p>------------------------------------------------------<p><a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2004/10/education-easterbrook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2004/10/education...</a><p>&quot;The researchers Alan Krueger and Stacy Berg Dale began investigating this question, and in 1999 produced a study that dropped a bomb on the notion of elite-college attendance as essential to success later in life. Krueger, a Princeton economist, and Dale, affiliated with the Andrew Mellon Foundation, began by comparing students who entered Ivy League and similar schools in 1976 with students who entered less prestigious colleges the same year. They found, for instance, that by 1995 Yale graduates were earning 30 percent more than Tulane graduates, which seemed to support the assumption that attending an elite college smoothes one&#x27;s path in life.<p>But maybe the kids who got into Yale were simply more talented or hardworking than those who got into Tulane. To adjust for this, Krueger and Dale studied what happened to students who were accepted at an Ivy or a similar institution, but chose instead to attend a less sexy, &quot;moderately selective&quot; school. It turned out that such students had, on average, the same income twenty years later as graduates of the elite colleges. Krueger and Dale found that for students bright enough to win admission to a top school, later income &quot;varied little, no matter which type of college they attended.&quot; In other words, the student, not the school, was responsible for the success.<p>Research does find an unmistakable advantage to getting a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In 2002, according to Census Bureau figures, the mean income of college graduates was almost double that of those holding only high school diplomas. Trends in the knowledge-based economy suggest that college gets more valuable every year. For those graduating from high school today and in the near future, failure to attend at least some college may mean a McJobs existence for all but the most talented or unconventional.<p>But, as Krueger has written, &quot;that you go to college is more important than where you go.&quot; The advantages conferred by the most selective schools may be overstated.&quot;<p>------------------------------------------------------<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in</a><p>&quot;But let’s look at those who got into both types of schools, some of whom chose Penn and some of whom chose Penn State. Within that set it doesn’t seem to matter whether you go to the more selective school. Now, you would think that the more ambitious student is the one who would choose to go to Penn, and the ones choosing to go to Penn State might be a little less confident in their abilities or have a little lower family income, and both of those factors would point to people doing worse later on. But they don’t.”<p>Krueger says that there is one exception to this. Students from the very lowest economic strata do seem to benefit from going to an Ivy. For most students, though, the general rule seems to be that if you are a hardworking and intelligent person you’ll end up doing well regardless of where you went to school. You’ll make good contacts at Penn. But Penn State is big enough and diverse enough that you can make good contacts there, too. Having Penn on your résumé opens doors. But if you were good enough to get into Penn you’re good enough that those doors will open for you anyway. “I can see why families are really concerned about this,” Krueger went on. “The average graduate from a top school is making nearly a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year, the average graduate from a moderately selective school is making ninety thousand dollars. That’s an enormous difference, and I can see why parents would fight to get their kids into the better school. But I think they are just assigning to the school a lot of what the student is bringing with him to the school.”",1425987245

Since Linux is developed in the open, these disciplinary discussions occur before a worldwide audience. One could argue that disciplinary mails should be taken off-list to allow the individuals involved to save face, but it could be counterargued that such mails are relevant and important to the kernel&#x27;s overall development process and shouldn&#x27;t be obscured lest other developers make the same mistakes.<p>The high visibility of Linus&#x27;s posts expose him to a lot of bleeding heart criticism, but it doesn&#x27;t really say anything about how useful or important the mails may or may not be; in short, the criticism that Linus is &quot;mean&quot; doesn&#x27;t say anything about the efficacy of the management style.<p>When management actually has to happen, when the manager actually has to step in and try to correct someone who isn&#x27;t doing their job correctly, it&#x27;s never a popular thing. The political impulse is to rally behind &quot;the little guy&quot;. We all respond easily and quickly to the stories of spurned employees who were &quot;totally mistreated&quot; by the Big Bad Employer. Because of this, it&#x27;s easy to look in and criticize Linus for sending a &quot;mean email&quot;, but probably not very fair.<p>We all want to sympathize with our peers, and no matter how much we may like them on a personal level, it seems there is an almost irrepressible instinct to want to denigrate our bosses. That makes it easy to criticize the calls when we&#x27;re on the sideline and not bearing the responsibility for the outcome. The actual knowledge of that responsibility and all that comes with it, including the massive flood of disastrously uninformed critics and the need to bite the tongue as they take their swipes, is &quot;the weight&quot; that persons in positions of high responsibility sometimes discuss. While it&#x27;s easy to acknowledge the hypothetical existence of such a phenomenon, I think it doesn&#x27;t really crystallize until one finds some measure of &quot;the weight&quot; on his or her own shoulders.<p>I hope we can all save a bit of empathy for the decision makers on the other side of the coin after getting an earful from and commiserating with our disgruntled contemporaries, even if it&#x27;s just on LKML.",1425986103

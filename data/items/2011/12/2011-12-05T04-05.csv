3313165,comment,3312009,3312607,4,0,barrkel,,,"Using Unix utilities (including Unix paths and forking semantics) on your Windows system. I regularly use Unix utilities to e.g. manage Windows processes; frequently, when a game crashes and leaves me with a blank screen, I can blindly alt-tab to a terminal and 'killall foogame', or if it's worse, ssh in.<p>I use Cygwin to get approximately the same terminal environment in Windows as I do in Solaris, Linux and Mac. I have a suite of scripts to massage platform differences (e.g. Cygwin getclip / putclip vs xclip vs pbcopy / pbpaste, or cygstart vs open vs gnome-open / xdg-open / etc.). It means that in the terminal environment, I'm equally at home no matter what the OS.<p>I run Cygwin in rxvt. Using a better terminal than a Windows command window is a must; until I started using rxvt, I didn't even live in bash. Rxvt / bash combo uses considerably less memory, less startup time and less disk space - my dual-boot macbook air has Cygwin installed in the Windows 7 partition.",1323061101

3313144,comment,3312502,3312502,1,0,mailanay,,,"Although it is unfair to generalize this to all Indian software companies, unfortunately, it is mostly true. In my opinion the reason is mostly one of these three:<p>1) Some Indian companies, look to cash in the price arbitrage, and have a short term view (3 - 5 years). So they bid for projects, where they have very little expertise and experience. (In India, there is a huge market for sub-sub-contracting. Companies, win projects and then look for people with expertise to actually execute them. (Personally I have been asked to consult so many times)).<p>2) Education in general is in shambles and especially C.S. education. Also education is (unfortunately) a business. For example the latest fad is to start Android development classes. So many are coming up. (but most of them don't have good tutors. (Again, personally I am asked to come in as ""Industry Expert""). Students join these classes and 3 / 6 months later they consider themselves qualified. (when in reality they know so little).<p>3) Most students (regardless of aptitude to software development) take C.S. is college because of better job prospects. Obviously they cannot be good engineers. There is such a shortage of engineers, that invariably such people do get hired (which feeds the cycle) and lowers quality of output.<p>About Me: I am an Indian software developer and founder of a software development shop.",1323060715

But that's not the real issue.<p>My main problem is the vagueness in wording (which might be attributable to the lack of formalization in mathematics in 1869). What does ""reason"" mean? Is it asking for a proof? And if so, what axioms and lemmas are you allowed to use? Are we talking about integer bases and exponents (things get <i>much</i> more complicated with rational and irrational exponents)? If you're allowed to assume the <i>definition</i> of exponentiation, then the behavior of multiplied exponents probably follows almost trivially.<p>To me, this question is equivalent to asking the ""reason"" that 2 plus 2 equals 4.

I've been working as an IT contractor in enterprise (government, large industrial, large corporate) environments for the last 5 years.<p>I've personally seen<p>- a boss with a policy to only hire ugly or fat girls, because pretty girls distract the geeks<p>- a level 2 engineer passed over multiple times for promotions, because she wouldn't say fuck in the presence of three or more members of the senior engineers group<p>- a systems engineer bumped to team lead, then project lead, then solutions architect, generally held to be the best boss anyone in her group had every worked for and one of the highest delivering tech leadership resources in the company, quit and start a business outside of IT when guys who were consistently performing below her metrics in other teams were getting better bonuses and better base salaries, and she was being told that there wasn't money to go around for her.<p>- an enterprise architect come back from maternity leave (10 months) where she had been effectively part timing (10 to 30 hours a week) because the incompetent guy who'd taken over from her was hopeless and kept calling her for help, who was told that because she'd been out of the current technology scope for so long she'd have to go back to the help desk for 6 months to come up to speed and she'd then be eligible to apply for a promotion, if she did a good job. The incompetent guy who'd been badgering her for her time through her maternity leave was made permanent in her old job.<p>- Company christmas parties organized behind the girl's backs - so that they could be held at a strip club, while the girls got stuck holding the fort while everyone else got paid to go to the pub.<p>The christmas party incident, the three girls who got stuck in the office were told to their face that it was a random selection and they just happened to come up. Three girls in a pool of 40 resources, and they happened to all come up? For a party that they hadn't been told about, at a strip club?<p>I worked with a girl once who probably wasn't as talented/knowledgable as most of the guys in the tech pool. But she was by far the hardest worker. Absolutely crushed our ticket system metrics consistently. But could never get a promotion. At first it was just air excuses 'oh, Dave just deserved it this time.' and things that were maybe plausible. Then they got thin - guys with less experience who weren't very good and way under performing compared to her getting promotions? They just did better in the interview. She started to get pissed about it - as she was passed over for about a dozen different promotions opportunities when the majority of her peers in the tech pool agreed that she should have had the promotion - she worked her ass off. Then she got a reputation for being hard to work with and a complainer - because she had the temerity to be pissed about the blatant discrimination. Any guy who had to put up with that crap would have been just as hard to work with.<p>My experience has certainly been that competent girls get fucked over in IT. And yeah, everyone in IT will be on the shitty end of a bad management decision if you hang around long enough. But almost every IT job I've had, and every competent girl I've worked with has had a laundry list of bullshit like that.<p>When your job is diagnostic investigation and repair - you learn to start looking for linking factors and commonalities. You get good at root analysis. It's not hard for anyone who isn't an asshole to see that the crap women go through in enterprise IT, almost certainly has something to do with their gender.",1323060055

I only outsource easy/boring work. I found a couple developers for the first job that were good enough for me to continue hiring them for subsequent jobs without looking elsewhere.<p>The way I did it (I was taught this by a friend who does it more regularly) takes a bit of extra micromanagement for the first job, but it will pay off for subsequent jobs because you should be able to re-hire the same people. Post a job, wait until you have about 15 offers and then pick the top 5 (filter them on their English and whether or not they specifically respond to your post). To those 5, assign different pieces of your total job as a test job (less than 3 hours of work each, and limited by the hours/week setting). The <i>most important</i> part of Odesk hiring is communication - use middle school English and make it clear that they are to ask questions immediately if anything is unclear. Be friendly and be sure they know that you are happy to help.<p>Of the five people you hire for a test job, at least one of them will probably not even start it. Another couple might start but not finish. You will almost certainly have a few that do decent work, though, and even if they represent different skill levels you can leverage them across different projects.

Having worked in both India and the US for over a decade, my experience tells me that the distributions for programming skills are almost identical in the two populations. The top percentile of programmers in India (those who work for Google, MS, Amazon) are as good as their counterparts in the US. The $12 crowd is about as good as the craigslist freelancers who charge a similar rate.
While you may not have to worry about being replaced as a programmer, what you should worry about is an India startup like Zoho or Freshdesk competing with your company.

My employer isn't one of the ones I mentioned above. But I know from friends working there, that this is the case there as well.<p>I think there are a number of reasons for this.<p>1. Many engineers just aren't interested in the old fogey US tech companies. Do you think a smart kid out of a US college would be more interested in working at Google/Facebook or at Cisco/Microsoft?

So its a lot easier to pick up good talent there even if the company is regarded as a has-been in Silicon Valley.<p>2. At some point in a tech company's lifespan, decisions seem to be made purely for financial/cost-saving reasons instead of for product/customer reasons. This is usually the point at which good engineers start leaving the company because they realize the bean counters are running things.
This is also when these companies start expanding their India ops. Word gets around, and hence this is somewhat co-related to point #1.<p>3.

At a big company, you're more likely to see a higher degree of specialization, whereas in the smaller company, you'll see people wearing more hats.  This should give you a chance to find what you like doing, so you can do more of that in the future.  You'll also learn a lot more this way.",1323057845
3312966,comment,3312502,3312665,7,0,jmspring,,,"I've worked with outsourcing both to India and Eastern Europe in three passed companies.  Your comment of ratios of ""good programmers"" to not, particularly in India is spot on.<p>A lot of outsourcing to India started with Enterprise Java applications, MVC/CRUD type stuff that was simple, but also time consuming.  So, it made sense to move the tasks that didn't take advantage of your strong programmers overseas to help with the burden.  A number of outsourcing firms WiPro, Global Logic, etc. started with this model.  Many, even well into the mid/late 2000s worked on these same Apps.  It was their domain of ""expertise"".  Teams were generally set up to have a ""good programmer"" as a lead/architect that was often your main contact and was responsible for one or more junior developers doing the work.  Even if you had a strong set of requirements and a good relationship with the lead, implementation could suffer from the ""chinese whisper"" effect  -- what you request gets distorted the further down the chain it goes.  For CRUD apps that weren't performance dependent, this was fine.<p>As the push for outsourcing continued, from my experience, these formerly Java Enterprise app shops were asked to do more diverse projects.  The majority of the ones I had to work with were a failure -- if they kept the same team structure -- i.e., remote lead who oversaw remote juniors.  The biggest cause wasn't necessarily one of background, it was more turnover and drive.  The churn was very high and developers were asked to do something boring or beyond their skill set (or, the still lingering issue of sticking to actual requirements).<p>One prior startup I was at outsourced non-core monitoring stuff that was a reasonable success.  However, a local executive was all hung ho about outsourcing more core technology until a couple of us put our foot down and indicated the unaccounted overhead of the local work needed to fix things.  That stopped that angle.  At the same time, we had amazing success outsourcing targeted pieces -- an arm assembler optimization of a key piece of crypto code, being one.<p>The reason for the success?  The coupling of a bounded small project that was sent to a team with that relevant skill set.  This is the key area where outsourcing is successful.  Bounded projects, targeted to a team with the relevant skill set, and good communications between them.<p>Where outsourcing fails is the generic skill set approach nd overhead that most of the big firms employ.  Local management just sees the reduced dollar and doesn't account for the extra time -- to fix, to integrate, and to iterate on deficient deliverables.<p>This isn't an india / US issue.  This is a good approach regardless of the topic.  It just happens that India was the envouge outsourcing destination and the majority of US Management solely focused on the assumed reduced cost.",1323057836

The problem with posts like these is they make massive generalizations which are not true. Not every body here is a genius and not everybody here is an idiot.<p>I have worked in extremely challenging projects which were billed for dirt cheap prices. Considering the cost at which finished the projects it was almost like we were giving our work for free. For every story like this there are a 100 good stories you will hear out here. There are also cases where people do endless work and those hours don't get billed. Yes, there are a lot of cases like this as well. There are 1000's instances where we do work without billing them because some one at onsite put a polite request. I used to work with a very senior person in the UK. During meetings he used to be shocked that we put that crazy hours and efforts for such low prices.<p>The problem some projects fail here in India is because of the same reasons they fails else where.<p>When you talk of all this, even manufacturing in China. You need to look that whole picture and then see how the statistics work. At volume, and that scale of economy, If you measure No of Failures Vs No of Success and measure them against money saved. It's a very different story.<p>One project failing somewhere doesn't talk of the whole outsourcing story.",1323057808

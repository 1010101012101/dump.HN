If you've already heard of that idea, I don't see what this adds. If you haven't, there are better sources.<p>I note that Mr. Dawkins does not compare language to a ""virus"" though he admits it as memetic, saving the words with harsher connotations for his ultimate target. He then takes a one-sided view, accentuates the bad, ignores the good, focuses on the least reasonable religious people he can find, and calls it a day. On the internet, we call this ""flaming"". But hey, at least he didn't bring up Hitler.<p>Bach? The University? Keeping alive European scholarship during the dark ages? Providing a center for community cohesion and services to the disadvantaged?

If your interviewee nails everything, it either means that you've got a class-A programmer, or your interview difficulty tops out too soon. I've become a big believer in gradated interviews. I've got a pretty good SQL series that starts out where the answer is literally ""SELECT * FROM some_table"" (though I find it occasionally trips people up to simply omit the where clause) and goes up from there on this little two-table schema. I've got some good HTML generation series that starts out with a simple ""can you dump out a table from a 2D array or equivalent structure?"" (since I try to do language-agnostic interviews) and go up through ""do you know about escaping"" and ""can you handle optional parameters"" and so on. Over time I've been selecting for the series that produce more gradation.",1259552613

967287,comment,966986,967083,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>If you want to learn how to be a coder, go to DeVry</i><p>It's worth noting that neither a DeVry ""degree"" or a Computer Science degree will make you a programmer.  If you just get the DeVry education, you will know what functions you can call in the Java core library.  If you just get a CS degree, you will know what B+ trees are.  But neither of those alone get you a working database management system; that requires excellent coding skill, and an excellent understanding of the underlying mathematics.  ""The real world"" requires that you have both sets of skills; only having half the education will make you less than half the programmer.<p>I think this is a wider problem in our field; the ""academics"" don't want to admit that the ""industrial"" aspect of programming is important, and the practitioners don't want to admit that the academics are quite-often onto some very good ideas.  Turns out that both sides are important.  The practitioner doesn't want to waste time reinventing simple concepts (which is why we have code organization techniques that were popular in academia long before they were popular in industry), and the academic doesn't want to reinvent industry (turns out that knowing about automatic testing and source control make writing your new researchy programming language a whole lot easier).<p>So it's clear that to be an effective programmer, you need to be well-versed in both the practical and academic aspects of the field.  Dismissing the practical aspects by saying they are a waste of time and that some dude from a trade school can handle them for you is ... short-sighted.<p>(Oh, and if Perl is a ""dinosaur technology"", Java, C++, and C are ""pre-life self-replicating molecule"" technologies.  Just sayin'.)",1259552402

At the end he defines science as a meme but not a virus by saying that virus requires ""spread me"" to be baked into it.<p>If this is the case, however, then ""mystery is a virtue"" is not viral as he claims earlier. Neither is wearing baseball caps backwards, for that matter.<p>Additionally, most scientific organizations and universities include an element of spreading their methods, so they too have a ""viral"" component.<p>When Dawkins claims that the fact that ""the selective forces that scrutinize scientific ideas are not arbitrary and capricious"" makes it non-viral, I get the sneaking feeling that whether or not something is a virus depends heavily on how Dawkins feels about it.",1259552390

967272,comment,966986,967083,0,0,patio11,,,"If you divide the sticker price of my college education by the number of class hours, the implication is that one hour of instruction costs about $80.  In the harsh light of that fact, I would still have paid a few hundred bucks to learn CVS or SVN in college rather than learning bad habits.  My first two jobs programming (academic and quasi-academic) didn't use source control, and I kept my bad habits until I got into industry and was dragged kicking and screaming into professionalism.  I think source control should be taught starting the first day of CS101.  If the exact tool changes in 5 years, oh well, you can learn the new tool.  But it should be an automatic, instantaneous, ingrained part of your process from day one.  (Ditto IDEs and basic Unix system administration.)<p>Four courses that have been worth substantially more than $80 an hour to me: Japanese, Technical Writing, AI (mostly because it really should have been called Introduction To Scripting Languages), and (weirdly enough) my single course on assembly.  That was entirely due to a twenty minute discussion with my professor that had an effect on me, the general gist of which was ""Any performance problem can be solved by caching, if you do it right.""  I haven't programmed a single line of assembly in my professional career but every time a performance problem comes up I cache and the problem goes away.

And if you were to reduce the randomness by somehow requiring the code or the app to conform to some standard in order to make it easier to automate the perusal, well we already have a whole SEO industry dedicated to gaming the current automated search technology, don't we? <p>At some point don't you think it is likely that the social networking application model will be co-opted by market testing enterprises who will design ways to entice lots of people to test software applications while having their physiological reactions captured online. With a record of human reactions directly correlated to a specific application, predictive results from automated searching would then be feasible. ",1193795429

The CIA removed their first democratically elected leader, Arbenz, in 1954 and the country has never really recovered. I don't think Perkins is far off. I've worked in Guatemala and China extensively, and in government in Canada, and none of what he's written here sounds far-fetched to me.",1193792768

And, while it is not slavery, it is real indentured servitude.<p>If I want to stay in this country, I am forced to work all the time.  If I am without a job for over 60 days, I am considered an illegal alien, and get in hot waters.<p>So, I can't just quit and say ""want to travel asia and europe for 60 days"", and then get a new job.<p>Or Just quit for few months, and work on something on my own.<p>etc.. etc..<p>I have 6 years of time-frame to get that Green Card.  End the process of getting it is LOONG.  I can't switch employers, or get a real promotion without having it to reset the process all over again.<p>In the meanwhile, the employer knows this, and uses in it's own advantage.<p>Sure, I can quit, and 
1. go home,  (forget about comming back to this country).
2. Switch employers  (and restart the green card process again).<p>Still, options that are not good for me right now, so  I have to put up with the ""Indentured servitude"" until I get my freedom  (which is the green card).<p>
This thing actually started in the early 19th century, where mexican labour would be brought from mexico to work on US lands,  but they had to pay all the expenses of the travel/documents themselves.  So, they had to work until they paid everything, which took years (with their very low wages).
Hence they were said to be in ""indentured servitude"", not quite slaves, but basically between a rock and a hard place.<p>
All my friends that got green cards, felt like they got freedom. <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servant</a>",1193792460

For instance, I have the impression that in work on program verification and static analysis OCaml is more popular than Haskell. Coq is written in OCaml, for example. The Haskell community much more vocal though.<p>Harper has strong opinions, but he has a few points. Haskell may be great, but one should be aware that it is not an improvement on SML in each and every respect. For example, SML has a much better module system than Haskell.",1374314348

Also, Apple has the courage to regularly deprecate and subsequently remove things from Cocoa/Core<i>/Darwin, keeping it clean, focused and elegant.<p>Which bring us to the GGP comment:<p>> </i>But any other API that is capable of as much as Win32 is would end up looking almost as bad, minus a lot of the legacy cruft, except of course in the time it takes to develop such an all encompassing API, you&#x27;d end up with legacy cruft all of your own!*<p>To which I disagree wholeheartedly (not just because of Cocoa, but every single sane API out there regularly deprecates then drops stuff). Win32 accreted features around a core of cruft like a black hole. The only solution for Microsoft is to relegate the 8/16/32bit heritage lying at its core and drop it dead as it&#x27;s collapsing under its own weight. Which is what they did with the Win8 internal design, where Win32 is relegated to a gangrenous limb awaiting to be severed.",1374313562

He&#x27;s a good writer, and is able to convey confusing aspects of statistical analysis to lay people. There are academics doing academic-y things in the shadows, and there will be for the foreseeable future. Silver, though can maximize the impact of his particular gifts by increasing his audience and chipping away at the enormous levels of statistical ignorance in the world.<p>In fact, there&#x27;s a great tradition of this in the sciences.

6074720,comment,6074486,6074486,3,0,TamDenholm,,,"I run a small cleaning business that brings me in some passive income, but when i was at the start i had this client that i eventually refused to do work for because he wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle. The bill for a months cleaning of his office was 500-ish. The guy was part of a family that owned an Oil and Gas equipment company that must turn over hundreds of millions of pounds per year, and that guy REALLY REALLY didnt want to pay his 500 bill for an office clean. He must have spent about 10+ hours going back and forth through emails and phone calls querying 2-3 hours here, the cost of cleaning supplies, complaints about the cleaners i&#x27;d sent, just to get his bill down, in the end his bill was down to around 400 and he eventually paid it, but he&#x27;d wasted his own time and the same amount of my time.<p>Now i consider 10+ hours of MY time to be worth WAY more than 500 due to what i can earn doing my usual consulting and also because i dont want to deal with douchebags like him, and what i make per year is insignificant compared to the company that he helps to run, so i never understood why the hell he&#x27;s kicking up shit over a damned cleaning bill. Infuriated me to no end.<p>Now i only have clients that pay their automatically issued invoices every month without issue, they&#x27;re happy and i&#x27;m happy, i get my beer money and i can concentrate on my consulting instead of my side business.",1374311219

6074716,comment,6069919,6072420,1,0,georgemcbay,,,"I&#x27;d argue in my case I should in fact be driving 80 mph a lot of the time, because everyone else is, and it is safer to go with the flow of traffic than it is to follow the letter of the law.  As I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware, non-head-on collisions become more dangerous when the delta between speeds of the colliding objects are divergent more so than they are impacted by absolute ground speed of the colliding objects.  In fact, even the DMV tells you to disregard the speed limit if it is at odds with the natural flow of traffic speed.<p>FWIW, I only ever drive 80 mph in 65 mph zones on large 5+-ish lane freeways.  On non-freeway roads, I don&#x27;t speed.",1374311057

I do not remember the quote exactly and i do not have the book with me, so I cannot look it up, but it went something like this:<p>&quot;The play was in perfect harmony with the modern rules of drama and storytelling or, in other words, it was perfectly idiotic.&quot;<p>I read this quote about 10 years ago in a Nabokov short story but I keep getting reminded of it whenever I see a modern movie. And they are getting very idiotic. The strict plot structure is making characters say or do stupid things just so the action can follow the predefined plot lines. This really prevents one from creating believable characters. All the reverses (the false victories and false losses) often make characters reverse themselves until they become mostly unbelievable to anyone that tries to remember the entire movie from beginning to end.",1374310930

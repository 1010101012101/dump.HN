I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars and completed dozens of mini projects, and plan on continuing to use their contractors far into the future. However, not once have I had the contractor sign any formal employment agreement/contract. There&#x27;s a part of me that&#x27;s saying &quot;c0w, you need to protect yourself. You need contracts!&quot;. To those of you who have expertise in this area: what clauses should be in this contract to protect me? In researching this question today I&#x27;ve come up with the following list that seems to be a good starting point:<p>--Standard employment clauses\n--Non-disclosure\n--Non-compete\n--IP and Trade Secrets\n--Forum to settle disputes\n--Non-Disparagement<p>What am I missing here? Does anyone know of any free sample contracts or templates I could use that are going to protect me and my interests?<p>I found a site called rocketlawyer.com and they have a number of sample agreements available for free. Has anyone seen these? What&#x27;s the consensus on them?<p>https://www.rocketlawyer.com/secure/interview/questions.aspx?document=34044058&utm_source=1024&v=3#q1\nhttps://www.rocketlawyer.com/secure/interview/questions.aspx?document=34044083&utm_source=1024&v=3#q1\nhttps://www.rocketlawyer.com/secure/interview/questions.aspx?document=34044085&utm_source=1024&v=3#q1\nhttps://www.rocketlawyer.com/secure/interview/questions.aspx?document=34044086&utm_source=1024&v=3#q1<p>Thanks,\n-c0w",1391497193

VRBO and AirBnB by and large are lead generation based so you don&#x27;t have real time availability on a majority of the properties. This means that a lot of the listings may already be booked and you wouldn&#x27;t know until you contact the owner.<p>- Location accuracy is a challenge. Home owners don&#x27;t want to provide exact addresses due to privacy reasons so for a lot of properties, owners have chosen to provide an &quot;approximate&quot; location which leads to a lot of properties in a neighborhood sharing the same exact lat/long and a lot of stacked pins or clusters on a map.<p>For reference, here&#x27;s a general idea of the number of property types: 300,000+ hotels, 550,000+ vacation homes, 300,000+ airbnb listings (lots of cross listing with vacation rental sites for sure), 50,000+ hostels = ~1M properties bookable after deduplication.",1391497023

One of those things that, once you come across them, you wonder why it took so long for something this logical to come into existence. I am not associated with the project, but these are just a few things I love about &quot;pass&quot;<p>1. Command-line based: which means I can script it, I can run it remotely, etc.<p>2. Uses Git to store the passwords: full revision history, changelog, and remote push/sync features that git is SO good at. Other password managers have to reinvent that whole wheel and none seems to do a good job. This also eliminates the need for &quot;hosted&quot; solutions - which I just simply refuse to use.<p>3. GPG for password encryption: once again, such a natural, awesome way to do things. GPG is already the safest way practical way to secure data-at-rest. I can rest easy that no silly homegrown encryption system was invented. Also, as long as I have the keys, in the worst case I can do the decryption myself, if I do not have access to &quot;pass&quot;.<p>The only thing I believe it might lack is the fact that the names of the entries are in the clear. Which means I cannot setup a github(private) repository as remote for my pass store: the passwords themselves would still be gpg encrypted, thus safe, but the repository will leak names of all websites and userIDs.<p>In anycase, kudos and thanks to the devs!",1391496871

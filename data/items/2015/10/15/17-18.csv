They deliver a boatload of code that does very little for the end-user.<p>* REST and HTTP 1 in combination. A page needs many different types of data. REST makes us send multiple requests for different kinds of data, often resulting with those 60-80 requests mentioned above. We could be sending a single request for some of them (e.g. GraphQL) or we could get HTTP 2 multiplexing and server push which completely fix that problem.<p>* JSON. Its simple but woefully inadequate. Has no built in mechanisms for encoding multiple references to the same object or for cyclic references. Want to download all the comments with the user info for every user? You have a choice between repeating the user info per comment, requesting the comments first then the users by id (two requests) or using a serialisation mechanism that supports object references (isn&#x27;t pure JSON)<p>* The DOM.

And I certainly made no such claim.<p>You wrote: &quot;even in the face of death, a Jew must refuse pork in order to remain true to his people&quot;<p>So yes you did make such a claim, and no, it&#x27;s not true. In the face of death a Jew MAY eat pork, and is actually REQUIRED to eat pork. Except in a public case like in the story.<p>> Eleazar was killed for refusing to eat pork .... I think pork has at least something to do with that.<p>If he was ordered to eat an apple from a tree less than 3 years old the story would play out identically. The pork is completely incidental, yet the author makes it central to his narrative.<p>> The eating of pork products was a key point of differentiation between the Romans and the Jews ..... not because the dietary laws relating to pigs are more important (to the Jews) than the other laws, but because the Romans ate a lot of pork products<p>So you do get it at least somewhat. But the author does not. The author makes the refusal to eat pork as something very important to the Jews to maintain purity, when actually pork does not hold any such central position. ALL the dietary laws are to maintain purity, pork is not more important than the rest.<p>The author believes Jews did not eat pork because it was physically unclean and they were required to maintain purity. This is false. Jews did not drink camel milk either - are camels physically unclean?<p>I can totally see how the Romans would elevate pork above other restrictions, but that&#x27;s a story about the <i>Romans</i> not about the Jews, and it has nothing to do with the eating habits of a Pig.

If the number of women graduating with computer science degrees is about the same as the number of women going into tech jobs, then presumably (3) is not a big factor.

Then the big question would be &quot;Why are so few women graduating in computer science?&quot; That could definitely be related to (1).

The intellectually honest will begin by pointing out that nobody really knows.  From there, we can talk about what we think <i>might</i> be responsible, but if we&#x27;re going to continue in the spirit of intellectual honesty, we must acknowledge that the gender gap in technology is part of a large and <i>very</i> robust phenomenon by which women prefer to work with people, and men prefer to work with things [1].<p>Granted, the people vs things dichotomy may well be the result of social conditioning, but it might also be indicative of an intrinsic difference.  (At this point, intellectually-honest feminists who oppose essentialism must also admit that the latter is a political and sociological theory, and therefore has no bearing on whether or not there actually are fundamental differences between the sexes from a cognitive and biological standpoint.)  Indeed, just as <i>de facto</i> gender differences can be fueled by social conditioning, so too can social asymmetries be fueled by biological factors.<p>While there certainly is evidence suggesting that the gender gap in technology is the result of systematic bias (or even discrimination), we must take care not to lose sight of effect sizes.  I have not looked into this myself, but I would be extremely surprised if, say, the use of gendered pronouns had an effect size that even remotely resembled the people-vs-things effect.  Social conditioning effects tend to be small compared to their biological counterparts (with notable exceptions).<p>So why are there fewer women in tech?  Those claiming to have the answer are at worst intellectually dishonest, at best ill-informed, and in all probability pushing a very narrow interpretation of feminism.<p>My fellow feminists (in name only, sadly):  disguising political ideology as science and abusing the connotations of the term &quot;source&quot; ultimately hurts your cause.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883140"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883140</a>",1444929582

This force constructs and maintains growth, structure, and produces organisms that are enough in some balance―chemical, physical, maybe spiritual, who knows―to survive further.<p>The force will push through the slightest openings in this river which is chaos, and just keeps growing and growing despite being forever torn down, consumed, and worn by the elements of entropy at the same time. This force, when put down and extinquished in one place will again and again remanifest itself in another place, and continues to create and grow against all the odds and the universal tendency for any space and matter to cool down and energy to return to the lowest possible potential.<p>Life is nothing but rare. If we blew up this planet into smithereens, I wonder, why would that force that is life stop swimming upstream at the very once? Why would it not reappear elsewhere? Some might say that the live organisms would just die with the Earth, but what started it here? Why wouldn&#x27;t it emerge again elsewhere just like it did here?<p>If the force is divine it will exist somewhere regardless of the physical circumstances, merely waiting for a new opening in the physical world; if the force is not divine, then maybe it&#x27;s some internal counter stream, an energy flow, in the the universe itself, where one part of the energy flows towards chaotic stillness but where the other part flows back into motion and higher potential: while entropy reduces the energy in action the potential must increase somewhere else, as energy cannot disappear. Or maybe you might choose consider the divine to be the universe itself―about that I cannot say a word. But there is something that makes this thing called life opt-in to this world where everything else keeps crumbling to pieces.<p>If that force is not special in itself, given the setting, then I don&#x27;t know what is.",1444929185

After all, if not youtube, anything else was probably slower at the time. Obviously you wouldn&#x27;t simply lose the desire to watch relevant videos, it&#x27;d be dimmed quite significantly sure but you&#x27;d still want to watch a video every now and then. Whether it&#x27;s a music video, or a chess match or a farming lecture, there&#x27;s just a ridiculous amount of content available. I have plenty of videos I&#x27;d want to watch even if I&#x27;d have to wait hours. (take torrenting for example, or pre-youtube & pre-streaming file sharing, video and music on p2p networks were incredibly slow yet incredibly popular).<p>But if you couldn&#x27;t even load the pages to browse through the videos, that&#x27;d pretty significantly reduce your watching even further.<p>Liken it perhaps to a library where you could only get 1 book per week. Well that&#x27;s not much, but at least you can get 1 book. But if you go to the library you have to wait in line for an hour, and after examining one book section of 10 books, you have to wait 5 minutes to examine the next one. Choosing the weekly book would become such a chore you&#x27;d probably not even bother to go anymore. But if you&#x27;d suddenly be able to examine the entire library with only 1 minute of total waiting, many more would be much more inclined to do so, even if they could still only borrow 1 book per week.<p>Beyond that in my experience, lots of requests in a slow connection often fails before completing fully. I don&#x27;t know why exactly, I&#x27;ve never been a network engineer. While streaming in a slow connection eventually gets there. So it&#x27;s entirely possible that even browsing normal pages was failing entirely before for some people, even though (if they ever did load the page and choose a video), the video download worked fine albeit at a very slow pace.",1444928807

We now use a Common Blockchain interface based on Blockcypher in production.<p>The main motivation for Common Blockchain was that we were tired of having to change our interface after a series of blockchain APIs we were using either went out of business or pivoted.",1444928462

6579506,comment,6579294,6579408,4,0,einhverfr,,,"> So the problem is that corporate media is politically streamlined? Yes, I absolutely think so.<p>Hilaire Belloc in 1918 wrote a wonderful critique of corporate newspapers where he pointed out that their real customers are advertisers, and that in many cases, the cross-ownership of media by other corporations, as well as cross-board memberships meant that the corporate press would necessarily adopt positions friendly to the largest corporations.  His book &quot;The Free Press&quot; (although very right wing) is worth reading.  It totally anticipates Chomsky&#x27;s critiques as well.<p>>  I enjoyed that a lot, until the selection of articles began to appear biased to the right. I think the idea is still great - give me unfiltered opinions and analysis, instead just filter by the &#x27;intellectual depth&#x27; if you will.

The US drone program is still routinely murdering many, even though most people consider it bad.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure most people would&#x27;ve considered the mass murder of Americans bad at the time too, since Christianity was prevalent, and we know what it says about murder. There&#x27;s obviously a difference from now, in that people were more xenophobic at the time, but there are still similarities to the current day.<p>It seems that while most of us are civil individually, as a collective, the civility is lost, and what is manifested is the barbaric elements among us.<p>The framework for what people consider to be good/bad is flawed and contradictory, because while most of us agree that murder is bad, we routinely pay a hit man to conduct it. Very few people consider that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening when they pay tax, but it doesn&#x27;t make it any less true. Some people recognize the fact and pay tax out of fear of what the hit man may do to them if they don&#x27;t pay, and many others will suffer cognitive dissonance in which they convince themselves that it&#x27;s necessary for &quot;the greater good&quot;, and downplay the mass murder and torture.<p>Rather than being content with what we have being better than what we had, we should consider the ways in which we haven&#x27;t changed from the past and do something about them. One thing that hasn&#x27;t changed is that we&#x27;re still paying the hit man. Will the hit man ever stop killing people when we continue paying it? Perhaps we should be thinking how to create a different framework in which there is no hit man. Perhaps then we may be called &#x27;civil&#x27;.",1382265423

Figure out what kind of job you want, find people that have that job and start talking to them.  The most important thing is DON'T ASK THEM FOR A JOB.  Just ask them how they got there and what advice they have for you.  I've gotten more job offers that way than any other method.",1330487883

Dont you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 11 How is it you dont understand that I was not talking to you about bread?

I have been telling my tale of woe on HN and elsewhere for quite a long time and have been unable to get substantive help of the sort that would end my crisis. I am genuinely desperate in a survival kind of way at this point. I have been desperate for money for quite a long time but I honestly am concerned about actual survival at the moment.<p>Thanks.",1330484827

Reduce feedback loops, etc etc.<p>In some of the 'worst' interviews I've conducted, it would become clear with 45 minutes to go that the candidate was a pass for technical reasons. After exploring for other strengths beyond the expected skillset, I focus the rest of these sessions on the really important things the candidate should know before their next interview with some other company. This is easy to present as standard interview questions, but with more explanation and context worked in to setup and 'next step' in multiparty questions. With no explicit ""you've failed"" ever stated, you have an opportunity to maintain a positive conversation, do the candidate a service and a favor by educating on what they need to learn next, and if you're really lucky discover that the candidate is a fast and eager learner who would be a great addition to the team despite current deficiencies.<p>Worst case, it's clear to the candidate where they're lacking without ever needing to state is as such. And who doesn't learn a little bit themselves every time they teach?",1330484690

""a monolithic subversion database"" depends only on the project, not on the bugtracker.<p>Set up a custom field where you put a url and/or git hash... and problem solved. Probably not as nice as Github which integrates both, but on the other hand Github's issue tracking capabilities are far behind JIRA's (no proper workflow, no structure for custom information, etc.) You'll have to figure out what's more important to you.",1330484627

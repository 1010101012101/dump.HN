He seems a little out of his element because a lot of physicists doing earth modeling use compiled languages like Fortran and C/C++ for the big simulations and python for the smaller stuff. Julia is cool though and a great substitute for the python stuff. It won&#x27;t implicitly solve distributed computing and the computational problems people have to create large models.

When compared to Japanese or Arabic, once could say English was created solely for printing. I&#x27;m a native Arabic speaker, so I can appreciate why people would claim it&#x27;s a difficult language to print. Word processors and some browsers, to this very day, sometimes have trouble rendering Arabic properly, especially when it comes to linking characters and Arabic punctuation.<p>> Telegrams historically looked like crap... they couldn&#x27;t even have punctuation!.<p>English punctuation does not significantly alter meaning in my opinion. You have sentence-ending punctuation, which is used to differentiate mainly between a statement and a question. Then you have separator punctuation, like commas, semi-colons, and colons. I don&#x27;t see them making much of a change either. And finally, the apostrophe and quotation mark. In addition, telegrams are short messages, so there usually is no need to convey complex meanings. Therefore, it would have been a slight inconvenience for telegram users at most.<p>In Arabic, changing a punctuation mark above a single letter in a word can change the word&#x27;s meaning entirely. Furthermore, letters are linked together to form words - this is not essential, but would make things much more difficult to read. Also, the position of a letter in a word dictates its &quot;shape&quot;. This introduces a ton of variation to the letters of the language, making it difficult for even modern keyboards to get right. I&#x27;d imagine it would have been even more complex at the beginning.<p>Of course, I think that the main barrier to widespread adoption of the printing press in the Arab World was more related to demand than anything else. At the time of the Industrial Revolution and slightly before it, the Arab countries&#x27; least concern was printing books, as they were too busy dealing with the imperialist occupation.",1448401751

Moving luggage handling below the plane allows two parallel tasks to execute: one stream is focused on passengers finding seats and the other is focused on bags being loaded.  Otherwise you have serial execution of passengers trying to upload bags to the bins before the next passenger can do anything.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/43768488"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/43768488</a>",1448401641

I am singling out students particularly since students tend to be more confident in their abilities and therefore might feel as if they know where a stock will go. Speculating however is a dangerous way to decide how to invest your money. Since the market has been in existence many have speculated and a very slim amount have succeeded. Those that have succeeded got very lucky. Many that want to invest, especially students want to because they want to be worth a lot of money and live posh lives. However, if you look at any list of billionaire investors none are speculating, they are either value investors or activist investors. These are the two most reliable ways to make money in the stock market. But before we talk about these approaches we first need to talk about the dangers of speculating.wall-street<p>What is Speculating?<p>According to Benjamin Graham, legendary investor and the father of value investing, speculating is where someone does not exactly know what they are buying. An investor on the other hand, thoroughly researches the companies they are investing in. Speculators also usually take a lot of additional risk than an investor. The most common thing that I have found about speculators is that they usually don’t have a logical reason based off of numbers and management to buy or sell. An example of a speculator is Jim Cramer. Cramer makes a lot of claims unsubstantiated by facts on his show Mad Money most of his claims are just speculations of how the market or a stock will perform.<p>“An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”-Benjamin Grahambenie graham<p>Hey guys to keep reading this post and to read more like it, check out my blog highschoolinvestor.com\nThanks!!",1448401627

That&#x27;s the point of copyleft: it&#x27;s power comes from exactly the same source as that of proprietary licenses.<p>In the particular case that your &quot;non-GPL&quot; license just so happens to be <i>similar</i> to the GPL, e.g. it&#x27;s FOSS, possibly copyleft, etc. then the original author might be feeling generous and be willing to come to some arrangement, e.g. by retroactively granting you permission for your derived work, or by negotiating a licence change with you (changing the license of either your code, theirs or both). Note that this would be orthogonal to the legalities; it&#x27;s a matter of whether the owner is willing to cooperate.

While it&#x27;s absolutely true that answering questions at a different contextual level from what was expected will give a negative impression, it&#x27;s also true that it&#x27;s very difficult to discern what contextual level an interviewer is expecting from just the question alone and not all interviewers have the same expectations.<p>But what I can assure you of it that at some point when you were veering off track from what your interviewer was looking for, your interviewer was sending you signals that you ignored. They&#x27;re often very subtle and usually unconscious on the part of the interviewer, but if you can attune yourself to those subtle ways in which they&#x27;re reacting to you, you can then vary what you&#x27;re saying (and, just as importantly, how you&#x27;re saying it) to meet the interviewer&#x27;s expectations.<p>There will be interviewers who want to hear abstract, high-level thinking like you exhibited in your interviewer. And there will be interviewers like the ones you met with that will want the opposite. There will even be interviewers like me that try to get you to do some of both and to be able to read my reactions to gauge which I&#x27;m expecting. Because for high-level engineering positions, this in itself is an invaluable skill. As a VP of Engineering, you&#x27;d need you to not only have technical chops, but also be able to read people. Whether it&#x27;s a meeting with board members or knowing ahead of time that a key engineer intends to quit, reading people is an important part of the job.<p>Tuning your game plan going into an interview is very important, and I think this experience has helped you do that. But if you&#x27;re not able to be contextually fluent, you won&#x27;t be able to make the on-the-spot adjustments necessary to really nail the interviews.<p>Some great resources on this come from the world of poker, where reading people and concealing your own intentions is a large part of the skill involved. There&#x27;s also good research from law enforcement on interrogating suspects. Both of these fields are too adversarial to be directly applicable in most situations, but they provide good examples of the kind of concrete things you look for to gauge someone&#x27;s response.",1448400185

Because anyone can write IF games, and this means Sturgeon&#x27;s Law applies, you should look for the masters first: Andrew Plotkin, Adam Cadre, Emily Short, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing many more.<p>Modern IF can be emotional, suspenseful, hilarious, surprising, experimental. There is a downplaying of &quot;gamey&quot; elements, and more focus is there in the storytelling or using the textual platform in surprising ways.<p>For example, one game -- <i>Fail Safe</i> by Jon Ingold -- has the player trying to communicate with the single surviving crew member of a spaceship in distress. Communication is limited, and the game&#x27;s parser <i>is</i> the crew member. Anything the crew member doesn&#x27;t understand is turned into a comms error (&quot;zzhghfz... sorry, can you repeat that?&quot;). It feels natural because it means you&#x27;re not simply typing verbs; instead, you are &quot;giving commands&quot; to a person!

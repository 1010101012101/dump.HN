Assuming they eventually win all the legal battles and drive all other taxi and taxi-like services out of business then how are they going to stop anyone else from entering their market?<p>Each transport market is effectively isolated (you don’t hail a driver from SF to get around NYC). This means any new entrant can achieve critical mass in a market at a relatively low cost (especially if they start with small towns/cities). If Uber do manage to get to the point where they can start extracting monopoly profits they have no means of defending these markets other than competing on unit price. Consumers are going to win big time out of Uber, but I can’t see how their investors will (at least their long term investors). Someone far smarter than me must have answered this?",1437613195

Yes, I&#x27;ve tried most of these (spectacle is new to me though), but I&#x27;ve found that shortcuts aren&#x27;t very consistent between apps, plus there&#x27;s no shortcuts for manipulating windows; eg, [alt+space, x] for maximize.  Maximising windows is a whole other problem (rightzoom mostly fixes this.. mostly).  It&#x27;s little workflow issues like that which put me off OSX.

People have been trained to understand what that shape means.<p>There&#x27;s lots of these errors of understanding throughout the talk, but the biggest one is the rolodex card icon.

And that, no, POST isn&#x27;t somehow &#x27;more secure&#x27;.<p>14.5b) Writing a barebones JSON API for them and watching their eyes glaze over when I explain what it is and why it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>15) Writing a session-based login for them because up until that point, you could authenticate as any user by storing their username in a cookie(because &quot;authentication&quot; was, literally &quot;do they have a cookie with a username? Ok.&quot;). Because my code caused people to log in every few hours the site was considered &quot;unusuable&quot; from a user experience standpoint and the code was rejected entirely, and rewritten from scratch, and then when they couldn&#x27;t get it to work the entire concept of session-based logins was considered &quot;impossible.&quot; Any future user authentication is planned to be handled using, and this is a paraphrase from the &#x27;CEO&#x27;, &quot;if statements and hiding javascript or something.&quot;<p>16) Explaining why using mail() to send emails from a shared server account to maybe every email address in the database might not be the best use of the limited resources we have but being told to add a mailer to the site anyway because it creates a more unified user experience. Bear in mind - nobody is paying us for anything.<p>17) Pointing out that using usernames as primary keys is a bad thing. There are no foreign keys - usernames are just copied as as strings where relevant. Some usernames have spaces in them. These are also echoed into javascript and passed back as function parameters. To say there are occasional issues with double-escaping and encoding would be an understatement.<p>18) Pointing out that encrypting passwords is actually not that great an idea and that being able to log in as an arbitrary user with  nothing but javascript is actually a bad thing and being sorry I ever showed them that because now it&#x27;s apparently an indispensable part of the admin control panel.<p>19) Oh yes - the only way to develop is on the live server with FTP. Version control is asking if anyone is working on the file you want to edit first.<p>19.5) Includes including includes including includes. Including css. Because all of the css and javascript is inline and half generated on the server. Many stalwart souls have tried to chart it out, all have failed.<p>20) Dealing with a pathological fear and mistrust of third party libraries.

They can&#x27;t just loan you money out of nothing.<p>Oh, I agree they have rules they need to follow.  The way modern lending works is the bank makes you a loan and then goes looking for funds to cover its reserves by borrowing against your loan document.  I&#x27;m sure they like to lend out depositors&#x27; money because it&#x27;s cheaper, but they certainly don&#x27;t need it.<p>They borrow from other banks if they can, but if not they borrow straight from the Fed at the &quot;discount window&quot;.  And when the Fed lends money it <i>is</i> literally created by changing a number in a computer somewhere.  So ultimately that $1000 has been injected into the economy though the creation of money (which will get destroyed slowly as the loan is paid off).<p>The point, way back in the beginning, was that the money supply is really only constrained by the amount credit-worthy borrowers are willing to borrow at a profit to the banks.  That&#x27;s why the Fed discount rate has such a big effect on the money supply - by raising it they make unprofitable some portion of loans that would have been profitable at the lower rate.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the central bank is technically part of the fractional reserve system.

They previously did this, of course, but it wasn&#x27;t legal.  And of course, not every &quot;black car&quot; became a green cab, so this still happens.  It&#x27;s the standard way to get around the outer boroughs of New York.<p>I watched a very common event unfold the other day in Brooklyn Heights.  A woman hailed a green cab.  It pulled over and the driver opened the window, asking &quot;where to?&quot;  The woman mentioned an address in Manhattan.  The driver said, &quot;sorry, green cabs can&#x27;t go to Manhattan&quot; and drove away.<p>That is 100% false.  Like yellow cabs, green cabs have to take you anywhere in the five boros, but they&#x27;re reluctant to take you to Manhattan because they aren&#x27;t allowed to pick up fares there.  They have to drive back to Brooklyn empty and not make any money, so they lie to customers to avoid that.  The end result is that you still can&#x27;t get a taxi in most of New York City, at least one that will pick you up near where you live and take you exactly where you want to go.<p>The &quot;ridesharing services&quot; rectify this problem; I&#x27;ve never had an Uber driver refuse to take me anywhere.  If the licensed taxis want to be free from competition, they need to follow their own rules.<p>Anyway, this Forbes article about green cabs tells the exact same story: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngiuffo/2013/09/30/nycs-new-green-taxis-what-you-should-know/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngiuffo/2013/09/30/nycs-new-g...</a>",1437611744

All living things are the products of evolution, and hence competition and the drawing of boundaries between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; (i.e. between the phenotype of the reproducing genome and the environment that is used to provide the resources to reproduce) is an inherent part of all life.  To be sure, cooperation can be beneficial to survival, but there is nothing in the laws of physics that insures that the cooperative boundary should be the entirety of one&#x27;s own species.  Peaceful coexistence is hard precisely because it is NOT our most natural, basic state.  This is not to say that peaceful coexistence is not desirable or achievable; it is both.  But pretending that it is a &quot;natural state&quot; is the left-wing equivalent of climate-change denialism.

Prior to that you would have had to be present when Mohammed revealed the narrations or had a precise rendition of that oration conveyed to you. At times Mohammed only spoke to one or two people when revealing surah. Having thousands of people memorise a number of separate orations exactly without any problem of conflicting versions is really impossible. Conveying the general meaning is within the realms of possibility; surahs revealed to large groups might even allow the preservation of some of the actual wording too.<p>Take an example - Armstrong&#x27;s speech when stepping on to the moon, was it &quot;one small step for a man&quot; or was the &quot;a&quot; not spoken? This is probably the most pored over of all speeches ever, millions of witnesses. Did no camel ever brae in the tents of the Qureshi tribe in Mohammed&#x27;s time?<p>Abrogation causes further problems to this claim as not only do all &quot;thousands&quot; have to remember the exact wording used but the exact order too, and they have only a couple of months from the end of Mohammed&#x27;s narrations to learn the last of them. Not only do they need to know the order, for abrogation purposes (to learn the way to act) but they have to remember the narrations in the same non-temporal order as everyone else. I can believe even that many of Mohammed&#x27;s followers remembered surah, mostly that they agreed on wording, but not at all that they remembered it in the &quot;wrong&quot; (ie not the delivered order) and that the order it was remembered in was identical (ie was &quot;the entire Quran&quot;).<p>Doesn&#x27;t 2:106 say that Allah causes ayats to be forgotten, those ayats must have been in the original - else they wouldn&#x27;t have been narrated by Mohammed - but aren&#x27;t now remembered and so are not in the &quot;entire Quran&quot;.<p>Of course if surah 25:32 (<a href=""http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=25&verse=32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=25&verse=32</a>) that says the Koran was revealed piecemeal is wrong and surah 2:185 is right then the whole Koran was passed on in one month (including future conversations) which makes it easier to attain unanimous agreement but also means that [if tradition that the Koran was passed on in 10 days is correct] the hearers were remembering > 600 ayats of prose each day for 10 days in a row; quite a feat for illiterate desert tribesmen regardless of whether they had a tradition of oral history or not.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in the Muqatta&#x27;at too - how were written character variations conveyed by the &quot;thousands&quot;?",1437610855

Even the ones that seem duck-like enough that somebody might deliberately pass them into your function sometimes turn out to actually honk like a goose (e.g. bytes vs. str in Python, or unicode vs. str in other versions of Python).<p>Having used mostly dynamic languages throughout my career, personally, a huge number of the errors I&#x27;ve encountered have boiled down to getting the wrong type of thing — an unexpected null, a Business where I expected a Person, an array where I expected a string, an escaped HTML string where I expected an unescaped one, etc. Sometimes they quack kind of like a duck, but still do it differently enough to trigger faulty behavior (e.g. people and businesses both have names and addresses, but the latter can be in multiple places at the same time).<p>It usually works right, but in the cases where you&#x27;re passing sensible types, you&#x27;ll probably be OK in a statically typed language too — not always, but usually. Static type systems introduce some edge cases where you need to think about the type system even though you shouldn&#x27;t have to, and dynamic type systems introduce other edge cases where your program&#x27;s behavior can be unexpectedly brittle.

Permanent and under user&#x27;s control. Internet based annotations are inherently unstable - one way today, different tomorrow, completely gone next week.

So, coming to the real question:<p>Looking at women and science - I know some great woman that were succesful in science. I can note one. I don&#x27;t know if she would be pleased, so I&#x27;ll refer to her only with name. So, her name is Zosia. She is going to represent Poland at International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics. She is also a very timid person. And what I want to say - I really like working with her. Not to say I&#x27;m an astronome (cause I&#x27;m not), but every single piece of work in class is really enyoing. And only because of her traits of charactere and knowledge. What was that example for? To point out that working in science with women is not really different that work with men who are on some intellectual level that I can accept.<p>I must say, that women in technology are a rare fration of the spectrum (at least in Poland). Since I&#x27;m 17, I have not really worked in a real environment full of various people. However, what I can thing of this affair is that being to work well is working without looking at gender of co-workers.<p>Maybe, if you&#x27;d like to ask me some others questions, I could answer. I really like issues from cognitive theory, formal logic and pure Maths.<p>Cheers! And I hope you can believe I&#x27;m a human being!",1437609877

Uber drivers are less enthusiastic on the whole, but they have generally said it&#x27;s better than working as a cab driver. I&#x27;ve since stopped using Uber since it&#x27;s hard to feel comfortable about their business practices, but they&#x27;re still better than the taxi monopolies and I&#x27;m happy to see them pursuing the fight and clearing the way for kindler, gentler services along the same lines.<p>I am generally inclined to think that people should be free to make their own decisions about their lives. Whatever you may think about the risk/benefit tradeoff, it seems clear to me that drivers in Seattle who have the choice choose to drive for Uber, Lyft, or a private for-hire service rather than put up with the traditional cab dispatcher. I can make guesses at why that might be, overall, but I am certainly not going to tell them that they are making the wrong choice.",1437609869

If I want a new execution context in Haskell—it&#x27;s a mere ADT, if I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful I use something else.<p>My point is that everything imperative lives in a monad. If you want, you can choose to be explicit about it which opens new freedoms. Or, if you don&#x27;t, you can just use the ambient one in languages which have those. Sometimes people realize great things by picking new monads. If it&#x27;s convenient enough you can do it every other line to great effect.<p>Ambient monads can be a little annoying though since when they exist you cannot &quot;get outside of them&quot; which will reduce your flexibility.",1437609838

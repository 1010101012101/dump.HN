I'm not so sure it's relevant to the SO question, mind, as it's more in line with optimisation than anything.<p>This might include:<p>* Using a caching layer to store and re-use the results of complex, infrequently changing queries, instead of querying the database on every request.<p>* Using a message queue to handle the processing of certain things in the background. If you have an upload form that then manipulates or processes the file in some non-trivial manner, add it to the queue. The queue can drop messages or jobs if it gets too big.<p>I only say this having developed some projects where holding the refresh key down for a few seconds on pages with lots of queries (along with the hundreds Drupal makes anyway) could crash MySQL.

When I was younger I wanted to be a ""hacker"" (the kind that does malicious stuff and ends up locked in federal prison), so I started using tools like backtrack to see if I could break websites, and it turned out I could. I just read things like OWASP, and I currently work for a security company that specializes in financial institutions (AKA banks, credit unions etc) so I acquire knowledge on the job as well. As for books, I found Security Strategy: From Requirements to Reality to be really good, but I haven't really read too many books on this subject to be honest. Certifications are usually cheap and no good, so I don't recommend those. I recommend learning about communication protocols though because if you understand those, you can figure out attacks that may happen just by knowing how they work. As well, there are applications like Webgoat that allow you to download them and they are full of security flaws so you can kind of learn from that. There are guides to teach you how to hack webgoat out there. The key to great info sec is thinking like a hacker, and you acquire by hacking websites (preferably webgoat/your own).",1336413406

My photos alone are over 20 GB right now.<p>Then there is the frequency with which you reboot your computer. It's true every item must be read at least once, but, with enough RAM, it's read only once per boot - if you keep your machine on for a month at at time, reads to /bin will hit the disk only once every month or so. Disk writes can be trickier, since waiting for the physical write may halt the thread for a while, but, unless you specify writes to be synchronous, there is no reason not to trust the OS with the data and let it flush the cache when it's more convenient. And subsequent reads to the data you wrote won't hit the disk again until the memory is needed for something else. Reads from RAM are still orders of magnitude faster than reads from disk.<p>I agree that once you have more RAM than your usual workload and the size of the most frequently used files, adding more memory will have little effect and, when you get there (say 8 GB or so) you are better off spending your money on a good SSD. Given the failure modes I keep reading about, I suggest getting a smalled SSD, large enough to fit your software, and a larger hard disk where you rsync it from time to time.",1336413121

Another might just be to encourage private companies to share more information about network attacks; the supporters of this bill are not wrong that private companies are loathe to do that now for a variety of reasons.<p>But again, ultimately, I agree with you.

Start learning javascript (codeacademy.com is a good place to start with) and then you can go on to learn jquery.\n2. PHP.\n3. Read about MVC/MPV architecture.\n4. HTML/CSS\n5. Install WAMP/MAMP or any other such server on your computer and play with it.\n6. Google any problem where you get stuck.\n   I realized there is absolutely no problem that you can't solve.

(A) require a private-sector entity to share information with the Federal Government;"".<p>As regards ""security"": the bill actually defines this term (a novel twist in ""cyber security"" legislation):<p><pre><code>    (i) a vulnerability of a system or network of a government or private\n    entity;\n     \n    (ii) a threat to the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a\n    system or network of a government or private entity or any information\n    stored on, processed on, or transiting such a system or network;\n     \n    (iii) efforts to deny access to or degrade, disrupt, or destroy a\n    system or network of a government or private entity; or\n     \n    (iv) efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a\n    government or private entity, including to gain such unauthorized\n    access for the purpose of exfiltrating information stored on,\n    processed on, or transiting a system or network of a government or\n    private entity.</code></pre>",1336412173

It also has other tips and tricks about how to secure against different attacks. If you ever have a security question, this site has a lot of secure examples for different code.<p>As the top comment on stack overflow says, never trust your users.

Could you point to something in it that leads you to believe that it provides any of the tools of SOPA? I know these discussions get contentious, but, respectfully, I don't see <i>any</i> mechanisms in CISPA that would enable the government to ""control"" anything. The bill literally does nothing but provide a mechanism for potentially private information to be shared; it is explicitly opt-in, meaning Reddit can't be forced to share anything under the terms of CISPA. There is no sneaky clause in it anywhere that would enable the government to, say, shut off an Internet connection, or turn off a DNS name.<p>I bring this up because there has been a lot of very terrible reporting on CISPA alleging all of these things; from what I can see, that reporting squares up with <i>no</i> version of CISPA that has ever been submitted.<p>If your primary source of information about CISPA is, say, Cory Doctorow, then of course I can understand why you think it might negatively impact Facebook to support CISPA. But Doctorow appears to be flatly wrong about CISPA.<p>Finally, that Wikipedia section is a hodgepodge (tracking opinions on evolving current events is not something Wikipedia excels at).

We have also fixed some issues regarding embedded images, encoding, attachments for EML to MSG conversion.  The main new and enhanced features added in this release are listed below<p>	Appointment.SetTimeZone() now accepts an instance of TimeZoneInfo\n	Supported creation of TNEF message\n	Added a property in MapiMessage class to detect the Outlook message type\n	Enhanced the component to retain the Sender Address formaat if it is not in Smtp format\n	MHT format can now include Email headers as well as Embedded images\n	Updated links in Offline Documentation\n	Embedded images appear as regular attachments when processed by Aspose.Email is now fixed is this release.\n	Saving mail message as .msg file corrupts original attachment file name is fixed\n	Appointment request when received, adds an hour to start and end times is fixed\n	Setting the Appointment Time Zone to ""America/New_York"" adds an hour to time is now fixed",1336411056

Do your OOAD, then construct the code functionally. Once you realize you're not going to refactor, start grouping into classes. Your OOAD helps drive your data structures out.

If that observation holds up, then what we're really talking about with organizing code is creating layers of DSLs, not tiers of functionality.

I hope you don't also go around telling biologists that its absurd that we're descended from Apes, or astronomers that its absurd that the Earth goes around the sun?  How about atomic thoery (which Boltzman was an important proponent of)?  Unlike the Bible Botzman was working from quantitative theories backed up by scientific experiments.  You might say that being a famous scientist is almost the same as being someone who has said things that were regarded as utterly absurd, but which were true.",1336410313

They've properly identified the problem (finally), and do have enormous resources in attacking it. As long as the daily deal product can hold its own and not bleed money, they're well-suited to build the 'operating system for local,' an analogy I've been waiting for. They could do some interesting work in B2B products, vertically targeted/non-discounted/package offering, and generally use their existing resource base to get people offline together in new and creative ways.",1336410191

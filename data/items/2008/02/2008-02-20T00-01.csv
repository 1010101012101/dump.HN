The ""tools"" page link above seemed too good to be true; but it turned out to be true, so does this mean it is that good?  I hope so...<p>I have been playing with Peacock for the last hour and I must say that the last time I had this much fun messing around with any sort of graphics application was way back when I discovered KPT v2.0 back in 1996.<p>Good job to the team at Aviary and worth1000.com!

It seems much learning is a process of successive approximations. Not only with adding -> algebra, but more advanced things, like algebra -> number theory or geometry -> calculus. You get to _doing_ some stuff because it _works_, then you realize (or rather, someone brilliant like Leibniz realizes) there's something the same in all of these cases,",1203466688

I may test it at some point but that would require more code and more risk than most A/B tests.<p>You may have noticed I have a guest login option.  You can play around with it to see what it does, but among other opportunities it asks people to sign up while waiting for their cards to print, etc.<p>I don't count guest signups as conversions for the purposes of e.g. AdWords, and it is a good thing, too.  For targeted AdWords traffic I get a fairly high signup to the trial -- 28% or so.  (That number still amazes me, since it is due to a change I made in this last week.  Landing pages -- they work.)  I also get another ~20% of people signing up as guests.<p>About 1.5% of trials go on to pay me money.

It's a software accessory to the iPod hardware. This may have been a valid argument when DRM was still prevalent on iTunes but these days that is not a factor locking people into iTunes. The iTunes database format is basically just XML. Easily accessible by other applications that want to make the migration to an iTunes alternative easier or an application that simply wants to build off the iTunes database. This is exactly how the BlackBerry media syncing software works.<p>On a broader note I would say anyone who does have a major problem with the 5 issues cited in this article should definitely look for another platform instead of constantly whining about it. It's not like it's all that hard to do. With a few small exceptions it probably takes a couple hours to fully migrate to non-Apple products & services. I guess that's why these Apple whines annoy me. It's very easy to switch if it really bothers you. I feel like the authors of these articles are making a big deal out of something that almost no one really cares about. The media loves the build-em-up, cut-em-down cycle and this seems like another example of it. It's good for page views, no doubt. When I see a real number of people switching to alternative platforms I'll believe it's really an important issue.<p>FYI Microsoft does not offer Zune software for OSX or Linux.",1249780733

There are plenty of books about OS internals. The books and articles I've found before tend to stay firmly in the theoretical, in the abstract. The aim of this series is to show how the theory can be implemented. Then, the reader has the knowledge to (possibly) implement their own algorithms and know how they link to the CPU's internals.<p>As to your second point - do you think that the memory manager in this OS is optimal? Do you think that the linked-lists everywhere are optimal? Of course not.

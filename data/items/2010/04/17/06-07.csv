1272735,comment,1271888,1271888,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"<i>But if you have hundreds of developers, and you have a dynamic trust network (I trust some people, they trust others, and we all tend to trust people more or less depending on what they work on), the CVS model is absolutely HORRID. It just doesn't work.</i><p>I can count on one hand the number of projects described by that sentence. No surprise, the Linux kernel is one of them. Linus built a tool to satisfy his needs. But most developers work in smaller groups, and these groups have explicit trust. Working at a company, the trust network isn't dynamic. Even in large open source projects, most of the commits are by a handful of individuals. It's not a big deal if the occasional one-time contributor e-mails a patch.<p>But most of my gripes with git don't have to do with its ideas. Although it's distributed revision control, in my experience everyone designates one repo as authoritative. Like centralized RVCs, certain users are explicitly granted write access to said authoritative repo. So git ends up working like an svn repo with a ton of branches.<p>My complaints about git have to do with its interface. Coming from svn, git is very frustrating to use. Certain benign commands in svn will erase your data in git-land. For example, ""git checkout filename"" is the equivalent of ""svn revert filename""; it erases any uncommitted changes. Of course, git has a revert command as well, but it doesn't behave like other RVCs. Git checkout can bite you if you have a branch with the same name as a file or directory in your source tree.<p>My biggest annoyance is if I accidentally commit and push something. Usually it's when I forget which branch I've checked out. Undoing a commit/push means rebasing or resetting, and that's where git drives me insane. I have used subversion, CVS, and even Visual SourceSafe, but only in git have I lost previous commits. Again with the misleading terminology. Why call them commits if you can destroy them with a single command?",1271487024

Its about taking risks and suffering the consequences.<p>When you pick a vendor, a bank or insurance company, there's a chance that entity will fail.  You're the one who has to judge that.  It's not the government's job to protect you from failing to do that, especially when others took the time to assess the vendor and decided to use a more stable, smarter company.<p>And its certainly not the job of government to take the consequences from those that misjudged their bank or insurance company and assign those consequences to others that had nothing to do with the decision.<p>I am not ""damning the consequences"".  The consequences are unavoidable.  Its just a question of who should pay for them.  Do we leave the consequences with those making the decisions that led to them?  Or do we dump them off on everybody else?",1271485387

Students were required to use these laptops for their coursework - in class and at home. No laptop - no going to class.<p>2. Despite the software being designed to track stolen property. The school district pursued a student for eating candy (drug suspicion) while is laptop had not been stolen. The software company has come out against the school and disabled the functionality the school used.<p>3. There's a video on youtube showing a systems administrator messing with the students on the laptops while in school (reading over their shoulders and what not).

By default, Hotspot does not compile a method until it is executed 10K times.  Most libraries in the Java ecosystem are written to optimize performance over a long execution lifespan at the possible expense of startup time.  The Apache HTTP libraries allow pooling of threads, HTTP keep-alive as an implementation detail, buffer re-use, etc.  So, evaluating these libraries by starting up a new JVM for each run inherently tests them under a circumstance for which they were not designed/optimized.  Gradle (a build tool) sort of solves the problem of short-run invocations by forwarding command line requests to a long-running Java background daemon.",1373770720

6039719,comment,6037690,6039225,1,0,justin66,,,"> The truth is that it is easier for most governments to justify giving subsidies to their own citizens rather than foreign countries.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with that statement at all. It is a statement that only speaks to public sentiment and it strikes me as probably correct.<p>>  Also self-sufficiency on food is seen by many as a security issue, and therefore there is a resistance to relying on others.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree but I suspect there&#x27;s little actual analysis going on among most people as to the actual tradeoff: the current system means we have an agricultural system that can carry us if we have to fight a world war capable of completely disrupting world food markets, as we are a net exporter of food. On the other hand strife, terrorism, and small wars are more likely until the developing world actually leaves extreme poverty behind. Having to compete with subsidized agriculture in the developed world slows this process. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#Poverty_in_developing_countries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#Poverty_i...</a><p>> The USA pays people to keep land ready but unused so that production can rapidly improve.<p>The only guy I know who gets one of those subsidy checks because he owns land will never, ever be a farmer. His yard was farmland once. Interesting system.<p>> The European Union instead accumulates surpluses - aka the famous &quot;butter mountains&quot; and &quot;milk lakes&quot;. Those are just different means to the same end - ensuring that there won&#x27;t be a major famine.<p>The policy contributes to poverty and famine in Africa. Ideally we would find a way to mitigate famine risk here without sticking it to them.<p>> The US policies started earlier, and were motivated by the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to European policy but the incentives and politics today in the US (in the area of agriculture, and everything else) are radically different than they were eighty years ago.

Could this have anything to do with bias against high-fructose corn syrup, which is chemically almost identical to honey?<p>The LA Times reported on the study in depth, and there are some serious deficiencies.<p>> &quot;After eight weeks, three groups of rats weighed essentially the same  the chow-only rats (462 grams on average), the 24-hour HFCS rats (470 grams) and the sugar-water rats (477 grams). But the rats that were able to drink the HFCS solution for 12 hours each day weighed in at an average of 502 grams, a difference that was deemed statistically significant.&quot;<p>> &quot;Complicating things further, the researchers cite a related study of female rats that found no difference in weight gain between animals that consumed HFCS or sugar over an eight-week period.&quot;<p>>&quot;the researchers found that rats allowed to drink the HFCS solution gained more weight over six months than rats with no access to a sweetened beverage. The difference was dramatic: rats with 24-hour access to HFCS gained 27% more weight than the rats stuck with chow only. But the researchers didnt include a third group of rats with access to sugar, so its impossible to say whether HFCS was worse than regular sugar.&quot;*<p>>&quot;The researchers remedied this problem in a third experiment involving female rats. Over a seven-month period, rats that were able to drink sugar water for 12 hours a day gained 183% of their body weight  the exact same amountas rats who could drink HFCS solution for 12 hours a day. However, female rats with 24-hour access to HFCS boosted their body weight by 200%. Its not clear why high-fructose corn syrup was more fattening over an eight-week period when it was available for 12 hours of the day (but not 24), yet the opposite was true when the experiment lasted for seven months.&quot;<p>This is what happens when reporters don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re writing about.<p>*&quot;(Why didnt they test the long-term effects of sugar? The researchers said it wasnt necessary because sugar consumption didnt affect body weight in their first experiment. True, but neither did HFCS when made available for 24 hours a day, and they did test that.)&quot;<p><a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2010/03/high-fructose-corn-syrup-hfcs-sugar-princeton-study.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2010/03/high-f...</a>",1373770438

6039697,comment,6038752,6039282,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"I see your point, but I&#x27;m not sure to what extent this would be probative (nor do I know how the actual chain of custody and discovery process actually played out, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether the prosecution fell short on its responsibilities or not).<p>The basis of my reservation, which may seem extremely pedantic, is twofold:-<p>First, it&#x27;s undisputed that Zimmerman spent several minutes following Martin while commenting on his suspicions to the police dispatcher. At some point Zimmerman exited his car, came face-to-face with Martin, and then they had an altercation. It seems quite plausible to me that Martin might have punched Zimmerman in the nose as alleged.<p>But it&#x27;s not the case that Zimmerman was doing his own thing, ran into Martin, and was attacked by him. Rather, we know from the recorded phone call that Zimmerman followed Martin for at least two minutes in his car, at which point Martin ran away and Zimmerman got out of the car and began to follow him (per <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin</a> which has the audio recording). Under Florida law (<a href=""http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/784.048.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/784.048.html</a>), Zimmerman&#x27;s behavior up to that point amounts to at least harrassment, and arguably aggravated stalking; it was certainly reasonable for Martin to believe that Zimmerman, through his actions alone, presented a credible threat to him.<p>Whether Martin was a peaceful person or not is thus (IMHO) mooted by the undisputed fact that Zimmerman was chasing <i>him</i>. Running away from another person is the exact opposite of an aggressive posture. Pursuing a person who is running away, by contrast, places the object of pursuit in a defensive posture. One could certainly argue that when Martin approached Zimmerman&#x27;s car to &#x27;check [him] out&#x27; and then ran away, that he had misapprehended Zimmerman&#x27;s lawful intentions. But when Zimmerman got out of car and started running after him, that could only be interpreted as a threat. The act of pursuit made the situation into a conflict, in which Zimmerman was the aggressor.<p>It&#x27;s worth considering what the outcome of this would have been had Zimmerman not shot Martin as he did - ie, supposing Martin had punched Zimmerman, knocked him down and straddled him as alleged by Zimmerman but that the police had shown up and stopped the fight before it went any farther. First, Martin would have have been able to argue that <i>he</i> was standing his ground in response to an unprovoked assault by Zimmerman; and second, that if Zimmerman had been convicted of aggravated stalking (and his behavior definitely constituted the elements of that crime: 1) wilful 2) malicious 3) repeated following, and 4) making a nonverbal threat placing the target in reasonable fear for his safety), then simply by virtue of carrying a weapon during the commission of that crime, he would have been subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years (<a href=""http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/775.087.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/775.087.html</a>).<p>Second (and this is more abstract), whatever the contents of Martin&#x27;s phone, they were not known to Zimmerman at the time of their interaction. So they <i>could not</i> have had any bearing on Zimmerman&#x27;s assessment of Martin. In other words, it would make no logical to sense to say &#x27;Z was afraid of M because M was the sort of person who talked about fighting and trading firearms&#x27; - you&#x27;re inviting the jury to consider knowledge after the fact as an input to Zimmerman&#x27;s self-defense claim.<p>Now it might seem like the prosecution is doing that with regard to Zimmerman&#x27;s past history of studying criminal justice and so on - but that&#x27;s part of the prosecution&#x27;s job in terms of demonstrating motive and prior knowledge. The prosecution is <i>not</i> attributing such insight to Martin, who knew only that he was being followed by a stranger in a vehicle. There&#x27;s no requirement for the prosecution in a homicide case to limit itself to the information that was available to the victim at the time of the incident (otherwise you&#x27;d be able to get away with murder as long as the victim were surprised).",1373769960

Zed says in one of the other comments that the inspiration for this was &quot;What if PHP got it right?&quot;  PHP came out of a long tradition of CGI apps, as a way to make templating dead-simple and still provide a bunch of programming language tools.<p>The brilliant idea behind CGI is that you set a directory as your cgi-bin, drop an executable file, and then the webserver will run that executable and pass in a bunch of data from the request as environment variables and on STDIN, and then send STDOUT back to the browser.  It&#x27;s an incredibly powerful idea with a really simple implementation.  You can write your scripts in any language, they can do anything, they can present further abstractions and run other scripts, they can embed other languages like Python or PHP or Haskell, and they can embed other frameworks like Django or Rails.  And all you have to do is drop a file in a directory and make it executable.  All because of the power of plain text: CGI &quot;speaks&quot; a uniform interface that any computer language can understand.<p>When I saw FuqIt, I thought of CGI because the brilliant idea behind FuqIt seems to be &quot;Drop a Python file or Jinja template in a directory, and we&#x27;ll call it via a uniform interface&quot;.  Kinda like CGI, huh, except it&#x27;s restricted to Python?

It wasn&#x27;t clear from your website if you have any advisory board or not.<p>NOTE: there is a very big difference between board of directors and advisory board, what you need at the moment is advisory board, don&#x27;t give out board of director seats unnecessarily unless you raise a VC round of funding or go IPO :).<p>By getting a good set of advisors you will be able to fill the immediate gap in your skills/experience that you&#x27;re facing and may even decide if any of those (or their referrals) need to be hired, if at all, for executive positions.<p>Now how you find advisors is non-trivial so I will advise you to look for people with experience in your industry and domain, and contact them. Even if their companies seem to be mildly competing at times, you&#x27;ll be surprised how many people will meet with you over coffee and might have recommendations.

Things like &quot;first month free&quot; don&#x27;t address this -- the fear isn&#x27;t &quot;we&#x27;ll try this service and it won&#x27;t work for us, and our money will be wasted&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;we&#x27;ll try this service, and an employee or hacker will sell our data to competitors, spam/upsell our customers, sell our contact lists...&quot;.<p>Obviously these aren&#x27;t the most likely scenarios, but it&#x27;s a bit like hiring a new employee who will be working <i>completely without oversight</i> with your company data...

The day before we launched, Amazon released its Android market and started giving away one app for free a day.<p>Most of the developers we were scheduled to release ended up bailing to go to Amazon.  I was the developer, and by launch day most of the heavy lifting was done (only took a couple weeks to build as I recall), but my partner was the marketing guy, and had all the relationships.<p>Right after we heard about Amazon's thing, he had some personal crises arise and ended up bailing. I don't fault him for it, as he had some decidedly real real-life family drama, but I wasn't even remotely equipped to handle the failure as I didn't know who had bailed or how to fix it.",1339873192

If you have read Chomsky's work from early academic stuff up through today, one unifying characteristic is that he is very good at polemics and very apt to it. That style is so much a part of him that it is completely unsurprising that he would use it even on something apparently strange like the invention of email.

I once had to find a file that a company was compelled to publish but then replaced with a different version after a certain time period. The company said that this was legally fine but rather than argue about it, I just looked at the source code and saw that the href of the currently published file had ""2"" appended to it, as in, ""list2.xml""<p>I knew from past experience that the company had hired someone to basically just make a separate site to host the damn file...in other words, the PR department had minimal knowledge/care about the technical details of the website.<p>And knowing how contract developers worked...that is, they know that if their client no longer sees a visible link to a file, than that file has been ""deleted""...I just tried something like ""list1.xml""...and voila<p>I know buffer overflow hacks are incredibly interesting but how many of the most significant hacks have been done through plain out guessing the target? I don't even mean social engineering...take, for example, the update_attributes hack on Github's rails setup. The vulnerability was well known and dismissed., so the hacker guessed how a project team might slip up and perpetuated an amazing and thankfully benign hack.<p>So I guess, a good start is to just be a decent programmer yourself, and to have understood why you follow the best practices",1339872924

I wasn't picking on Chomsky for being political.<p>Even much of his work in linguistics was polemics - the famous review of <i>Verbal Behavior</i> is pure polemics.<p>edit: and in interviews Chomsky has said that he felt a lot of this work had an essentially political purpose - talking about some nexus between Continental-style rationalism and opposition to totalitarianism, with which he associated the behaviorists",1339872766
4121311,comment,4120136,4121229,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Some people are stupid :-) He would have learned much working for you for four hours, <i>and</i> he would have a rare collectible jersey!<p>But I disagree with this <i>""I find such people manipulative. They have money, so they try to twist the rest of the world to play by their rules.""</i><p>Sometimes it is as you say, a sense of entitlement, however sometimes it was an opportunity they didn't have.<p>Let me share two anecdotes to illustrate, first we have old VAX parts. You know that architecture that Digital Equipment  made around the turn of the century. During the big Y2K scare a lot of perfectly good VAX computers were dumped for scrap, I bought too many of those. But in putting together working examples for my collection I would have extra parts. Sometimes I'd sell those parts. I asked a guy who was buying a part from me for more money than I had paid for the entire system why he didn't do what I do and just pick up scrapped machines? His response was surprising. He related that he spent his time shipping stuff around the country, he made good money doing it. He used VAXes running his custom software to make that work. He spent his time doing what he was good at, and then using the extra money he made to occasionally go out and buy a VAX part. The money was fungible he could translate it into VAX hardware easily. If he subtracted off the money he would lose by spending his time buying up old machines and testing them instead of shipping stuff, and added back the money he saved by getting parts this way, he still came out behind just shipping stuff . So while I might think he was 'paying a lot' for a part, he was, in fact, saving money!<p>A more personal story, early in my marriage my wife and I would occasionally get into arguments about chores. (I'm sure this was unique to my marriage :-)) She wanted me to do a variety of chores, and I wanted to hire someone to do those same chores. My reasoning was that at the time I had a number of people who were willing to pay me $75/hr for consulting on various technical projects. This was work that I enjoyed doing. Further there were lots of people who would do any number of household type chores for $10 an hour. So I could spend the weekend doing a consulting project, make $750, and then hire someone to come out three times a week, four hours a day,  and do chores for the whole month!<p>In neither case, my VAX parts buyer, or myself, was trying to 'twist the world to play by their rules' rather, there are rule equivalences that are arbitrated by their monetary value. My 10 hrs of consulting was 'equal' to a month of housework, but it is absolutely true that I wasn't following the 'rule' of 'husband does housework too.' [1]<p>The life lesson I took away is that, like the concept of 'enterprise' value, strict monetary exchanges don't include the emotional cost as well. The emotional cost can and does change the sales price significantly at times. It can be useful to know when someone is so emotionally invested that the total cost is outside the market. As with raganwald's shirt, the replicas can be bought elsewhere for much less than the total cost. When the startup founder's emotional investment prices the startup outside of market norms it can be leading indicator of trouble.<p>[1] For future and current husbands out there I do not recommend you try reasoning to this by explaining you could spend your time building a robot and then it would do the housework. Rather than impress your spouse with your robotic skillz they get rather insulted that you think their work can be replaced by a robot!",1339872758

I'm not sure if you are aware of this or not, but until Windows Vista, if you wanted to install Windows on a machine which had IO controllers or other hardware it did not recognize required to complete the install, you would need to provide Windows setup with drivers. And until Windows Vista those drivers could only be provided by a floppy. For real. I know it sounds like madness, but those were the breaks. PC vendors had to deal with that.<p>So basically until Vista, having a floppy-drive was a defacto requirement for a Windows-machine. And people didn't like Vista, so until Windows 7 you sort of had to play by those rules as well.<p>As for laptops, I find it hard to give Apple credit for innovating when all they did was the same as everyone else, make things smaller and lighter, only taking it a bit further.<p>So...

How to look into the guts of a program - currently running or while dormant - and figure out how it processes any and all input you are able to feed it.  What mechanisms are in place to prevent exploits.<p>2. Study bug classes and exploitation techniques.  Information leaks are often important to remotely exploit code protected by ASLR.  Build fuzzers.  Use a tool like the absolutely incredible Vivisect recently released by visi at SummerCon a few days ago to see whether it is possible to get to a vulnerable code segment from the entry points you are able to find.  Craft input to reach the identified bug, and leverage it to achieve arbitrary code execution.  Never forget that while your focus may be zoomed in on a handful of opcodes that there is in fact an entire system environment in place and potentially at your disposal.<p>It's a daunting amount of information.  Many of the best have been taught via something reminiscent of oral tradition, and like anything you wish to achieve mastery of you will learn faster with feedback from those with more experience.  Most public hacker forums are about downloading tools for SQLi and have nothing to do with exploit development at all.  But make some friends who are good at it and seek their feedback.<p>I guess start off by reading the corelan exploit tutorials, which go pretty deep pretty fast and may be a good start for somebody with programming experience.

The other problems that plane ownership brings (besides routine maintenance, which the airlines do own) are outside the desired core competency of airlines.  The leasing of aircraft to commercial airlines is quite an industry in itself, and the transactions often involve complex, multilateral bond financing.  There are almost always complex financing arrangements involved.  Few buy a 737 with a bag of cash anymore than one buys a skyscraper outright.  It is done by some of the world's less creditworthy airlines, and American has a penchant for owning, but it is increasingly not the normal industrial practice.  Investors go in on planes just as they do on any other massively expensive capital goods.<p>Thus, the key for a drug cartel would be to get the various intermediaries involved in the aircraft leasing and financing process (some of which are surely quite corruptible) to lease one to ShellCorp, or buy on the secondary market, as some have suggested.<p>The bigger mystery for me is how they manage to fly in the context of overall international airspace control and air traffic control.  Like someone else said, a 747 can't take off and land on a desolate patch of grass.  Law enforcement and intelligence aren't stupid; they know how much money is in the ""air charter"" business, and it definitely won't pay for a 747.

(For example, Margaret Thatcher's research chemistry impact is much less well known than her political impact.)<p>And yet, Chomsky is one of those few, having become one of the leading opponents to the Vietnam War while in his late 30s - as your link itself implies - and so doesn't fall under the premise of your comment.",1339870405

I agree that this seems like a good way to structure an app since it gives you one point with which to interact with your data. But, unless you have a nice javascript frontend that just makes AJAX calls to the backend won't all requests require two HTTP requests: one HTTP request from the user to your server to get the page and then another HTTP request from your server to your API to get data?

We all agree that there was copying in some direction with THIS particular example since the css files are identical. And who knows, maybe they both independently copied from a third party like a library of layouts. But I am presuming C copied from B here and not C and B from A. Regardless, the fact it is identical is far more than coincidence.<p>As far as using the same web layout as far as having header footer menu and columns it's not even a coincidence, it's just a standard layout. It's not a coincidence that someone else has a red car, they are very common.<p>I will address the issue of whether a layout that looks similar is definitely a copy. I don't agree with that.<p>Is using ""0px 2px 5px #CCC;"" as drop shadow settings proof of copying as you are claiming? Absolutely not. It is not some obscure color, it's GRAY. <i>Gray drop shadows are very common.</i> The assertion that the other settings are too particular or unique among billions of possibilities is completely absurd. You really think this is the only site with this drop shadow setting? I will bet you $500,000 it is not. Warning: I already checked. That is not surprising at all. 0px for horizontal offset is not just common but required for shadows coming from an above light source. 2px vertical offset is common as well. 5x blurring is common as well. The entire combination is common and obvious as well. But let's say some random site has 3px vertical offset instead. It's going to look quite similar to one with 2px. Is it a copy or not then? Can't tell from just that, it's irrelevant in fact. Two sites that look similar on the web, using generic common layouts, are not necessarily copies of each other. Even if they use a lot of the same colors and drop shadow settings and margins, especially when we are not talking about #CCC and not a color like #12dca9. It is also not uncommon to have white background behind text and a single pixel grey border. That is on thousands of sites. As is the light grey background. Google finds ""background: #F9F9F9"" on over 500,000 pages, many predating the existence of HM's domain name registration. Did they steal background: #F9F9F9 from others? Probably. I mean, why #f9 and not #f8. #F9 is a bit of an odd choice. HNM at least used blue for their masthead background. HM uses: #F60. Where have we seen that exact shade of orange before? Hint: it was ""stolen"" by HM from the top of this page you are looking at. This leads to another problem. Hacker is a common term. Hacker News is reasonably generic, but it is known as being this site. When I see a site that says ""Hacker Monthly, the print magazine of Hacker News"" and uses the exact same recognizable color scheme as Hacker News, I definitely assume that it is run by the same company. Only if I scroll down to the bottom do I see a ""not affiliated"" disclaimer. This is quite confusing given that it claims to be ""the print magazine OF Hacker News"".

There are really thousands of assumptions each computer program makes about the external world and security research seems to work by giving those assumptions an examination much closer than the original programmers gave.<p>In the end I don't think there is too much to say about ""exploit development"" per se, it's all about identifying those assumptions that could be fruitfully abused, once you find a way, writing the exploit should be the easy part. So, I would take some amateur ftp server, or maybe something famous for its insecurity (I know wuftpd used to have a bad rep) and then basically try writing a FTP client that tries to break some restriction the server or protocol intended to keep. From there, you just have to learn to identify more assumptions, by studying programming languages, operating systems, network protocols etc., whatever might be helpful (and it always amazes me what kinds of crazy details people in security can take advantage of). Another aspect is exploring the assumptions of software you don't have the source code of, so basically reverse engineering.<p>I am more of an admirer of security work than a practitioner, so maybe other people can elaborate some more, but I hope this is a valuable starting point.",1339869653

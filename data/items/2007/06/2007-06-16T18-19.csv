28573,comment,28343,28343,0,0,mhartl,,,"I think the title is a bit misleading: the essay argues that <i>documentation</i> is more important than code.  Comments are only part of that.  <p>The prototypical one-line comment immediately before a line of code is often superfluous---a sign of a missing function, or the need for introducing a more descriptive variable binding.  In contrast, more extensive documentation comments, operating at a higher level of abstraction than the one-liners, do fill an essential role by providing motivation and context.  <p>Whether documentation is ""more important"" than code is debatable, but surely many pieces of nice code suffer for lack of decent documentation.",1182019001

Can somebody explain the appeal of it to me? Now, myspace I always considered lamentable crap, but the <i>appeal</i> was fairly straightforward...it gave people an easy way to build their own websites (which tended to be wildly, err, creative) and a way to connect them to those of their friends. Myspace had a zany, fun, creative...howsoever crappy...appeal to it.<p>But facebook pages have this sedative-like uniformity that I just can't wrap my head around. Why are the kids going to this? The whole thing feels dull.<p>The facebook api--can anybody link to a good example of how this works? I'm not sure what kind of 'applications' you can make with stripped-down javascript-free html, but what do I know?<p>Well, what I know is this: The whole appeal for <i>developers</i> is mathematical. It's just a goldrush--and like any goldrush the profits GO TO THE FIRST ONES WHO ARRIVE. The demand/supply curve is all on the demand side because there are so few facebook ""apps"" at the moment. Once saturation hits, the old web with its old freedoms will be the only real player again.",1182018746

I did start a list of the Feature Request thread, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18085</a> , perhaps you could add them under there?<p>Ideally, the whole DB of posts and users would be available in some other format than scraping HTML that allowed for easy incremental updates allowing those of us interested to produce their own stats or other tools, e.g. search.",1182018160
28565,comment,28410,28491,0,0,Tichy,,,"It's not a security thing, simply a housekeeping thing. It is more readable and understandable if an object only exposes the methods that it's user needs. It's about reducing complexity. <p>I think in Java you actually can access the private methods of an object via Reflection, if you absolutely want to.",1182017553

[...] A type is a concrete representation of a concept.  For example, the C++ built-in type float [...]""
--Stroustrup<p>This emphasis on concrete types is how I use and think about objects.  If it doesn't cleanly act like a concrete type, I prefer to write a library that provides the data structures and related functions separately to the user.  I hate how languages like Java shoehorn EVERYTHING into objects.  It's very useful to keep the distinction between what cleanly forms a type and what doesn't.",1182017254

It's just to different degrees and how we harness it - ie attributes such as self pride/confidence (positive narcissism) vs arrogance/grandiose (negative).<p>Narcissism is getting a more bad rep due to today's over sharing platforms (and for valid reasons), but I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss/defend from the label.<p>You may not notice it, but outsiders can see it more easily (ie: headshot taking half the page).

Secondarily, we reached out to a member of the sales team and got a fairly curt response about their 1,000 startup initiative.

If you want to argue third-party sales, you are correct, which just goes to show how well Nintendo sells its own games. However, a significant portion of the third-party software lead that the PS3 and Xbox 360 have goes away if you ignore Call of Duty, which also just points out how massive Call of Duty is.<p>This data actually surprises me further, because ask anyone who even knows what a third-party is and they would say Microsoft and Sony have much better third-party support. However, sales-wise the difference isn't nearly as significant; considering cheaper cost of development it would also seem irrelevant. It seems to me that third-parties simply didn't/don't want to develop games for the Wii.<p>Now with the Wii U doing poorly, I don't see the trend shifting to more third-party support for Nintendo.

The larger companies however like to buy at a discount, and the discount comes from someone in a foreign country taking part of their pay in dollars and part of their pay in the right to work and live in the US. That seems to vary with individuals of course but my observation at Sun, NetApp, and Google was that it could be worth up to 50% of the base salary for an individual to work in the US. That is a heck of a gap to fill.<p>It would be great if the H-1B system was updated to allow sponsored people to work anywhere as long as it was in the field they had said they were going to work in and they didn't spend more than say 180 days being unemployed.

I have never said that single-letter names are completely prohibited - just that they should be avoided when possible.<p>I actually went and did some analysis on the code I think is good: Underscore.js. This is what I found.<p>I excluded all language keywords like `var` and `if`. I then calculated how many unique names there are in the code and how many of them are 1 or 2 letters long. The result I got was 4%.<p>I then checked how many times each of the names was used and how many times 1 or 2 letter long names were used, Surprisingly I got almost the same result - 4%.<p>So, to conclude - if more than 4% of names you use are shorter than 3 characters than you're writing bad - or at least worse than Underscore.js - code. I'm not guilty of this, I checked my own code too. And how about you?<p>Also, on a more personal note - you're infuriating as a adversary in the discussion because of at least three things: you only answer to parts of arguments that are convenient to you, you don't openly state assumption you're making and you're mixing completely irrelevant things into the discussion.

In ten years time, the sophistication of miniature drones to the size of insects, or with eyes that can see 5+ miles in exceptional detail will be what are available to those with the resources to exploit them.<p>Personally, I think that anyone interested in being anti-drone should be focused on the following areas:<p>* Drone-to-drone combat (Drones that have sensors on them to detect and attack (via collision or weaponry) other drones found<p>* Radio jamming (of frequencies used to control or communicate with the drones)<p>* visuals jamming (massive IR beacons designed to drown FLIR/IR sensors)<p>I wouldn't be surprised to see drone security offerings hitting TheLuxuryDivision within ~18 months time.",1362712110

Given the state of the video codec world at the time of Google's On2 acquisition, purchasing a codec that was explicitly designed to avoid MPEG-LA patents seems like the only viable path they could have taken to a royalty-free codec for the web.  And remaining royalty free is essential to the very concept of the World Wide Web.<p>Developing a new royalty-free standard would only invite participants to try to include as many encumbered concepts as possible to derail the royalty-free aspect, or to delay ratification and implementation for as long as possible to preserve the revenue from their royalty-bearing codecs.<p>Having a standard that is designed by committee should not be an end in itself, but only a means to an end, and if other means are more expedient, then the other means should be used.",1362712018

As the dark pixel represents material and the white pixel is empty space, you'll need to use thin supporting structures within the QR margin of error otherwise there wouldn't be anything to hold the material in place. Do a Google Image search for ""letter stencil"" for what I mean by thin supporting structures.<p>That small caveat aside, it's super easy to construct: start with a solid block of material, take QR code 1, and from one face carve out the white pixels all the way through, keeping any thin connector pieces as required. Rotate to another face, do the same for QR code 2, rotate again, and do the last face for QR code 3. The remaining structure is what you 3D print.",1362711936

Depending on the average length of an input line and how many of the lines are unique, storing only the SHA-256 hash value could take far less memory than storing the input lines along with a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash value.",1362711668

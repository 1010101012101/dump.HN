4034725,comment,4034279,4034479,5,0,mdm_,,,"Hi. Long-time lurker here; I just created an HN account to reply to you. Your post expresses some of the things I've been feeling about social media that I haven't been able to express very well myself (I had to look up ""Maslow pyramid""). The sort of unease and nausea, the whole thing just feels somehow creepy and wrong.<p>I deactivated my Facebook account long ago because of this feeling. I think what it boils down to is that I don't think I should know so much stuff about my friends, family, co-workers, etc without having obtained that knowledge by directly interacting with them in meaningful ways over long periods of time. The Facebook model <i>appears</i> to let me know people better, but it's in a shallow, passive way and encourages me to conceptualize people as caricatures, assembled from a handful of their most obvious or outstanding personality traits. I realize this stuff has been around for a long time, but FB turbo-charges it, and I feel like it's an extremely poor way to ""know"" people.<p>The really messed up part is that while the effects Facebook seems to have are often anti-social (think of how many times you've been out with someone and they're too busy checking status updates on their phone to carry on a real, actual conversation), people are labelled anti-social for not participating.",1338235134
4034724,comment,4034528,4034528,21,0,kijin,,,"> <i>the system was not intended to record anything except gunshots</i><p>So, they could record conversations, but they won't for the time being. A classic example of using software to temporarily cripple the true capabilities of a computing device.<p>In the hands of DRM-wielding corporations, ""defective by design"" results in inconvenience and loss of users' freedom. In the hands of the surveillance state, the same technique results in a situation where citizens must simply trust the authorities to exercise restraint. Because the police could flip a switch at any time and record all sorts of conversations. Somehow I don't trust that the switch will remain un-flipped for long. And when it does get flipped, as it did in New Bedford, everyone will say it was just an accident.<p>Maybe, just maybe, we should accept systems like this as a necessary evil in certain cities where there's a lot of gun violence. Still, I don't like this. When it comes to the government, I'd much rather give them hardware that can't be unlocked ""by accident"" because there's nothing to unlock. The thing is, it's unrealistic to do that in all cases, and we have to hit a balance somewhere. Which is exactly why systems like this raise difficult issues.",1338235129

Apple approved Air Speakers  an app that enabled you to stream audio to your iOS device from iTunes and iOS devices. Using the private key of the AirPort Express. Sadly it was a horrible app. Synchronization wasnt even implemented, so the audio was hopelessly out of sync, when sending audio to multiple devices.""<p>I believe this is why Apple requires you license AirPlay.  Not so they can make a quick buck (I'm sure the license fees are trivial to Apple), but so they can make sure things that work with AirPlay don't behave as the author claims the AirSpeakers app does.<p>They later claim that AirPlay implemented the key to stop piracy; ""The encrypted stream was initially implemented in order to protect the transfer of DRM-encrypted iTunes Music Store audio content,"" but doesn't back this statement up.  I think they implemented the key requirement to enforce their licensing.  I can't back this up either, other than it explains Apple's actions better than his theory.  The licensing isn't there as a profit center, but to give them some quality control so that AirPlay doesn't get a bad reputation for being difficult to use or unreliable.<p>The thing that doesn't make sense is that supposedly Apple rejected this for using private APIs.  This doesn't sound like the case.<p>It'd be interesting to know what the AirPlay licensing terms are like, and whether or not the AirFloat developer or Rogue Amoeba approached Apple to license AirPlay (I'll guess no).",1338234214

Rather, U.S. consumers can't seem to get enough of cheap goods from countries with lax labor laws imported by corporations like WalMart that exert market leverage due to their huge purchasing volume. Even manufacturers of high-end goods like iPads outsource their labor to places where labor is cheap, because they understand that very few people would want to spend $1000 on an iPad, even if the extra cost went toward promoting social justice.<p>So who is the ""we"" that's going to ""force"" this? We live in a democracy, and consumers are also voters. These voters may not be thrilled to re-elect politicians who enact laws that increase the prices of consumer goods (or energy, or other commodities that affect the average person's standard of living). And this isn't something abstract that people will think only affects somebody else -- it's something they'll feel every week when they have to spend a much larger percentage of their income on food, clothing and other necessities. (Yes, the price of food will go up under your proposal since it's largely dependent on oil, which comes from many countries that don't have U.S.-style labor and environmental standards.)",1338233830

It's no mystery why it's so popular. It's the leading platform to share information and media with the world. It is also a platform for apps that have a unique and very powerful advantage: you can just link to an app and you can use it just a couple seconds later, everything is automatically saved and loadable from any web-connected device, and if you don't want to use it again you can simply forget about it. This is a much nicer experience compared to manually downloading and installing/extracting an app.<p>However, the web has many serious problems. The web originated in the early 90s as a way to browse text and images, and new things have been haphazardly stacked on top of that over time, resulting in what we have today. It is a lot trickier to make dynamic content for the web than it should be. Due to the limitations of JavaScript, its web API and the web overall, anything scripted for the web browser feels like it's a flimsy hack. People have made much software to try to make things more sane--jQuery, CoffeeScript, GWT, etc.--but they can't solve the deep architectural problems that the platform faces. The time we could be spending focusing on making cool things is lost trying to wrestle with web browsers to get them to do what we want them to do. That's a huge loss in productivity.<p>We would all benefit if we redesigned the web from the ground-up.",1338233244

    * settings_env/logging.py
    * settings_env/local.py
    * settings_env/dev.py

4034609,comment,4034279,4034279,20,0,drostie,,,"Email has a lot of warts besides its obvious graces, especially when you look at the back-end of how emails are actually stored and transferred and authenticated. So I think we as programmers are naturally drawn to the idea of developing the email-killer. The central problem with the dreamers seems to be that they're not dreaming deeply enough.<p>Email is a communications multitool which leverages the whole human subconscious to effect its various uses: a human is supposed to know whether this is a ""your boss demands that you do this"" email or a ""your friend wants you to look at her cute cat"" email or ""your uncle is ranting about fluoride in the water again"" email. Most email killers do not and cannot eliminate this mental overhead. Graham only says ""other people should be able to add to my todo list"" -- he's not killing email, he's considering an email-aware todo list. That's very common. Skype is not an email killer precisely because it doesn't dream big enough: it is a realtime messaging protocol which hit it big because it worked with video. Trello is not an email killer precisely because it's for organizing groups. RSS is not an email killer because it only solves the limited problem of keeping aware of new content.<p>Email does all of these tasks -- poorly, but it does them. If you want to really kill email, you need to offer the core functionality effortlessly. Email II would understand ""circles"" of friends automatically, so that there is only an ""inbox"" for those people who are contacting you for the very first time. Like syndication, Email II would host the content on the publisher's web server to be downloaded whenever the client wants -- this has spam-deterrent effects, since the network doesn't take responsibility for the content. It would hopefully allow us to unify mailing lists. We can protect privacy with automatic cryptography; ""chris::example.com"" can stand for a public key which is stored on the example.com machines. The email killer needs to be good at segmenting messages so that we can say ""This is the text of my invitation to a wedding, but it also comes with a standard-appointment-form where I describe where and when it is, so that it can be rapidly added to your 'upcoming dates' in the relevant social circle."" (Since this must merge with dates and todo-lists, presumably example.com contains its own list of stuff which chris::example.com has stored for his own use.)<p>And I want to at this point admit defeat: because I think even <i>those</i> ideas are <i>not daring enough</i>. The email killer is probably going to have to do even more than all of that, and my own imagination becomes limited.",1338232861

I assert it would be extraordinarily difficult for a fab operator (like TSMC) to insert a back door without the designer/manufacturer knowing it.<p>I also brought up that in my experience adding back doors was certainly done to aid in testability. Sometimes those aids are done in a way that they cannot be used by third parties (bond-out chips) and sometimes they could be (JTAG access) but are obscured in some way.<p>Backdoor access in the firmware however, is a much easier threat to actualize as it doesn't involve silicon hacking per se. So that is a more credible threat. And I mentioned that we've seen counterfeit versions of 'name brand' products already which would be a fairly straight forward threat.",1338232412

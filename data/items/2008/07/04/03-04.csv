235914,comment,235864,235864,0,0,tx,,,"Wow... Linux gained 18% - nice. The numbers still seem pretty low to me. A close examination of Austin coffee shops would suggest that macs have at least 70% market share and Linux is at least 10% while bookstores have 80/20 split of OSX/Linux with Windows laptops nowhere near.<p>Meanwhile nation-wide numbers for UNIX-derived systems are lower. Damn you, Oklahoma and Midwest...  :)<p>On a serious note, I wouldn't want Linux market share to grow above 10% and OSX - above 25%. Anything above will lead to these systems losing their essential properties: OSX will become bloated with shitty software, trojans and malware, and Linux won't be geeky anymore.<p>I'd like Linux to stay within 3-5% to ensure that we'll continue getting a decent hardware support, and Macs should stay around 10% to keep Apple hungry. Maybe at some point they'll finally switch default setting to gamma 2.2 and fix Finder, iPhoto, Mail, Aperture and other similarly dysfunctional softwares: kind of hard to recommend a Mac to a Windows-based photo enthusiast (especially Picasa user), he'll laugh to death after glancing at OSX which is supposedly superior when it comes to photo work.",1215143709

Helps to keep thinking fresh and flexible. Just a matter of defining appropriate conditions of success and failure (which may itself be a part of the game ;).",1215143700
235912,comment,235390,235755,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"It's implemented in machine language somewhere.  Programmers should know what a register is.  It's implemented in electrons, too.  And, some of the best programmers I've known were EE majors.<p>Don't get me wrong, it's wise to know your craft.  That's never a bad thing.  But it's foolish to use a tool that is, frankly, not as powerful.<p>Saying a tool is ""powerful"" doesn't mean ""you can do lots of stuff with it.""  You CAN saw down a tree with a screwdriver.  But a chainsaw is a much more powerful tool for that job.  Yes, a screwdriver can do lots of things that a chainsaw can't, which only proves that it's a more versatile tool.  The <i>power</i> of a tool depends on the context of the problem you're trying to solve.<p>I'm guessing that screwdrivers are used in the assembly of chainsaws.  They still suck for cutting down trees.  Same with C vs just about every other language.  C is a fairly small step up from assembly.  An important step, no doubt, but for most tasks that software developers face, especially on the web, it's not appropriate.",1215143548

You basically implement a simple interface that defines the map/reduce operations and then your code will be copied to the cluster nodes through a peer-to-peer classloader.<p>In a recent test I validated a million image urls in less than a minute. In a small EC2 cluster running GridGain.<p>It's certainly worth looking into if you are interested in that kind of stuff.<p><a href=""http://www.gridgain.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridgain.org</a>",1215142682

235903,comment,235835,235835,0,0,aasarava,,,"Even if you disagree on the exact number of people you need to test with, the key point here is that you don't need to have access to an expensive usability lab to get good feedback on your product.  Just looking over someone's shoulder as they fumble their way through the interface you designed can be a huge eye opener.<p>My partners and I have been building a family intranet service (Kinverge.com). As soon as we had a working prototype together, we each sat down with various members of our family and asked them to perform several tasks on the site (register, invite others, add photos, post a message, etc.)<p>After the initial instructions, we kept our mouths shut and simply took notes.  And this is important -- don't jump in and try to help when the tester gets confused or lost.  Seeing the actions users make when they're lost is just as important as seeing how they got lost in the first place.<p>The notes we gathered during these sessions later helped us decide what changes to make to the site and in what priority.",1215142452

235899,comment,235390,235806,0,0,jrockway,,,"But C doesn't have any mechanism other than exiting or returning a value that indicates ""false"".  Both are non-optimal.<p>One (exit) makes the code simpler, but makes the consuming application extremely flaky; the other bloats the code with a weird API where functions modify their arguments:<p><pre><code>   errorcode_t do_some_work(int arg1, int arg2, int *result)\n</code></pre>\nand forces the client code to check every single error and decide right then and there what to do.<p>It's possible to write code that way, but why would you want to?  This is a solved problem; why keep using a square wheel when round ones are available?<p>(Yes, there is longjmp.  Still a lot of work to use that square wheel.)<p>In the end, don't think I care what programming language you use.  It doesn't matter.  But I do think that C should be dying off now; it is much less useful than it was 30 years ago.",1215142178

People are creatures of habit and will continue doing whatever they were doing before.  That doesn't mean we need to care though.<p>But anyway, threads aren't the solution.  They are way too low-level and too easy to screw up.  That's why I recommended STM previously.",1215142024

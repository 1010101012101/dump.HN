Stormbringer,0,1352,1.0,0,633,"True story: today I went down to the local $non_profit and helped out one of the guys get his new Apple laptop hooked up to the network and the network printer. The network worked immediately after entering the WEP password. The printer didn't work first time, so I deleted it and tried with new settings. It worked the second time. I also tried to persuade him of the virtues of buying a 1-2TB drive and using Time Machine.<p>It was so easy it was embarrassing.<p>I contrast that with some work I did with a startup last year. I bought one of their own Windows laptops into their HQ, and trying to get onto their own wireless network was a nightmare, even though I had a room full of techies to help. I strongly suspect that in the end the tech support guy just turned off the wireless router and left it off because it was too much trouble.<p>I'll do Apple support for love (ie free support for friends and family) , but you couldn't pay me enough to do Windows support. I fully appreciate the guys that do take on that thankless task, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone.<p>Does that make me an incoherent raving Mac fanboy? You be the judge. But consider at the same $non_profit I stood and patiently nodded while one of the 70 year old blokes told me about his Windows experiences. At the end I fully commended him (he's running anti-virus, anti-spam and does regular backups) for his efforts, and I assured him that he was doing the right thing with the backups, to keep doing exactly what he is doing. I didn't preach to him about Apple at all, I don't see the need. If he's happy, let him be happy. If he is doing everything right but has some nagging feeling that he should be doing something else, I will reassure him that he's miles ahead of the rest of the pack.",1290656708,1452891611

StudentSell,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Studentsell.co.uk was founded after it became clear that the Scottish College and University community had no dedicated online service to aid students with their studies and student life as a whole. We have identified a market place that has yet to be fully tapped into via the Internet and could be considered as an electronic version of the ultimate student notice board.<p>Studentsell.co.uk is an entity designed to act as a medium that enables students in Scotland to trade physical items and share information with each other. We do not incorporate a bidding system used by auction sites...there is no reserve pricing, auction end times and last minute sniping here. Instead members are offered items at a set price for immediate purchase.<p>Studentsell.co.uk is quickly becoming a name synonymous with further education in Scotland and developing into an integral part of College and University life for students all over the country.",1216414004,1452886327

Its that conviction that gets us out of bed every morning and keeps us up late at night thinking of better ways to empower creative people.<p>Company Overview<p>In developing StudioVox, we envisioned a social networking site that would energize interaction between people working in different creative fields and change the playing field of creative promotion. StudioVox is the first online community that includes all creative fields and provides a complete ecosystem for creatives; creative professionals, creative industry, agencies, and fans all on a single platform.<p>Description<p>Creatives promote their work and talents, agents and industry find talent, and enthusiasts view, discuss and purchase the artwork and music they enjoy. These three entities produce a vibrant community, create the foundation of StudioVox, and move us towards our most fundamental goal  to be the most effective medium for promoting creative people in the world.",1360095867,1452909634

When I began to think about raising seed capital, there were few alternatives to consider. Thats when I realized that instead of founding a company, founding Baseline would be the best use of my skills and interests. Bringing a diverse experience from eBay, Microsoft, Kleiner Perkins, Starbucks and Digital Equipment Corporation and an avid love for affecting change, Baseline addresses the gap between individual investors and institutional venture capitalists. My purpose is to help founders build and grow their early stage companies into change affecting enterprises.\nSince inception Baseline has invested in more than 60 companies including YC co's OMG Pop, Heroku, Xobni, GoLocal and others.  In total, I've helped more than 15 companies exit and there are more in the works.  Baseline is proud to be a seed investor associated with such promising companies as Instagram, Twitter, Weebly, Formspring, Heroku (acquired by Saleforce.com), CoTweet (acquired by ExactTarget), GeoAPI (acquired by Twitter), IndexTank (acquired by LinkedIn), Rupture (acquired by EA), Sendori (acquired by Ask.com), Parakey (acquired by Facebook), Versely (acquired by Cisco), Aardvark and DocVerse (both acquired by Google) and Hunch (acquired by eBay).",1332699646,1452908450

Chase after the things that interest you and make you happy. Stop acting like you have a set path, because you don&#x27;t. No one does. You shouldn&#x27;t be trying to check off the boxes of life; they aren&#x27;t real and they were created by other people, not you.

Specialization is for insects.</i> - Robert Heinlein, Time Enough For Love<p><i>All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptable.

After going through a succession of the early consoles I finally got my hands on an almost real computer in 1983, a Timex Sinclair TS-1000, which had a whopping 1K of memory, and no usable software. I worked my way up from there, through C, VB (don&#x27;t hate), Perl, Cold Fusion, the .NET stack (mostly C#), Javascript + JQuery, and most recently Ruby on Rails.<p>I&#x27;m also loving Ubuntu, if that means anything to you.<p>Feel free to check out my CV at http://careers.stackoverflow.com/steverb.<p>My blog is at: http://steverb.com<p>If you think I could help your project, feel free to contact me via email at me@steverb.com.<p>http://strictlydev.com/devs/steverb",1251297867,1450207814

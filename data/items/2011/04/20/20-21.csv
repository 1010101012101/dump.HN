Begin with a simple JDBC-backed servlet + JSP web app, like a blog (boring, I now), and deploy it to a servlet container like Jetty or Tomcat.<p>2. Migrate your servlets to Spring MVC and all that that entails: creating an applicationContext.xml, setting up the DispatcherServlet, view resolvers, message sources, form binding, transaction management, etc.<p>3. Migrate the JDBC components to Hibernate. I hate Hibernate with a passion but it's <i>de rigueur</i> in modern JEE. Bonus points if you use it as a JPA provider.<p>4. Deploy your app to a application container like Glassfish. Learn how to use JTA and how to access container-managed resources with JNDI.<p>5. Make the front end and back end of your web app talk to each other over JMS. Look into ActiveMQ and other service bus middleware.<p>The first three are pretty much essential if you want to score a gig. The next two not so much but they'll give you an edge during interviews.",1303333030

I agree posting even fewer pages may suffice. However, some contribution levels will be $5, $10, or higher. We feel people donating higher amounts will want to see a little more of the story's direction. We do allow authors to release and edit writing as they see fit.

A perhaps more ""prototypal"" approach would be to define instances by using object literal syntax. But the object literal syntax does not allow one to define the prototype, so it is more limited than using constructors.<p>One of the proposed extensions in the abandoned ECMAScript 4 proposal was to allow prototype definition in object literals, like:<p><pre><code>  var obj = { x : 10, __proto__: protoobj };\n</code></pre>\nThis would make prototypal inheritance more natural, since you don't need the constructor as an intermediate step.<p>ECMAScript 5 has the method Object.create which creates a new instance with the given prototype:<p><pre><code>    var obj = Object.create(protoobj, {x: 10});\n</code></pre>\nBut this is not yet widely supported, while ""new"" has been in the core since day one.<p>Basically the JavaScript language has been slow to fully embrace its prototypal nature.",1303332208

I respect Al's long held stance not to do parodies without the artist's consent while acknowledging that he is legally within his rights to do so. But I also don't think it is really that surprising that Gaga would want to actually hear the song rather than just give the go ahead based on lyrics. Anyone who has been online for any amount of time knows that the written word comes off a lot different than spoken/sung. And it is actually not that surprising that she wouldn't consent, considering it is fairly harsh in calling the song a Madonna ripoff and calling her persona fake and manufactured simply to take money from her fans. It is a pretty big anomaly given Al's history, I can't recall anytime he has really gone after the artist he is parodying before.<p>Al is being a bit disingenuous with the whole ""I respect the artist's wishes"", but then releasing the song and banking on the Streisand effect to do its magic.

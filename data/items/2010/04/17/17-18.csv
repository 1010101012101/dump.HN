This is a game ""that explores our own relationship with our past...you encounter enemies and collect puzzle pieces, but there's one key difference...you can't die."" You can go back in time and correct your mistakes. In chess, this is known as taking back a move, and negates the whole discipline of the game. Nor am I persuaded that I can learn about my own past by taking back my mistakes in a video game.

Because most of us have played some game, be it Shadow of the Colossus, Okami, Flower, or another game, and thought, ""this game is beautiful."" We think the developers of these games deserve accolades and they deserve to have the game recognized for what it is - a piece of art.<p>I don't wish to insult Ebert - he is a man I admire for many reasons, but I don't really care about his opinion in this case.

1273368,comment,1273241,1273335,0,0,cgranade,,,"Which is a real act of moving the goalposts, really. Can video games only be art if they compare with masterworks? What, then, of those poets today whose works will fail to stand the test of time? Are they doomed to have all their toils ""not art"" simply because somewhere, sometime, there was a better poet?<p>A deeper complaint, however, is that the great masterworks of video games are incomparable to the great poets, filmmakers, novelists and poets because video games are an inherently different medium. If the plot of Heavy Rain were presented as a TV miniseries or a movie, it would be at best mediocre, but the plot is simple in the game precisely because it branches and reacts to your choices-- something no movie can do. Thus, the story expands in ways that a movie cannot, and it loses in a naive comparison.<p>As I've said elsewhere, the Metal Gear Solid series is a wonderful example of an artistic work, but it too would lose much if direct naively compared to a great novel-- its charm comes from (among other things) its delightful strangeness, its vibrancy and its interactivity. The story is dynamic and something to be <i>explored</i>, rather than experienced.<p>A better comparison may be to a written work like <i>Lyra's Oxford</i>, a companion to Phillip Pullman's excellent <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy that serves to show glimpses of what the protagonist's alternate England looks like, letting the reader explore a truly foreign land. How much more, though, can you explore the post-apocalyptic landscapes of Fallout or the dark urban fantasies of Final Fantasy VII? By leveraging interactivity, these games allow you to explore an environment in ways that books simply cannot. This isn't to say that books don't have their own strengths over games-- they definitely do!-- but rather to emphasize how different the media are.",1271525760

Just because one <i>can</i> embed poor prose or low-budget animated cut scenes doesn't mean that the medium is limited to just such things.<p>Don't tell me that the surreal landscapes of <i>NiGHTS into Dreams</i> weren't art-- I spent many hours as a kid exploring every nook and cranny of those levels all while trying to run away from the dreaded alarm clock. The start of the fourth level of <i>NiGHTS</i> forces you, the player, to make a choice that ultimately draws you into the game even more-- you must trust that you have enough control of your environment to jump off of that cliff and fly.

You, the player, have to make a physical action to get through the battle.

This is key because it makes GPL <i>fundamentally</i> different from a EULA. As the FSF notes, licenses for proprietary software try to take away your freedoms, whereas GPL adds to them. This works because GPL only imposes requirements on you when you do something that the law otherwise disallows. The typical EULA tries to stop you from doing things the law otherwise allows.<p>If you obtain a legitimate copy of a GPL program and completely ignore the license, but only do things that copyright law allows you to do without needing the permission of the copyright holder, such as running the program, or making modifications to adapt it to run on your specific machine, you will not be in violation of the license--because the license only expands your copyright rights.<p>Affero GPL's requirement to distribute source is triggered by letting someone communicate with your running copy of the program.

That is the definition of a code.<p>Text is considered to be a digital code, because words have no ""likeness"" link with what they mean, whereas images form an analogical code because an image generally looks like something real.<p>Now when considering a programming language, textual or graphic, you're in presence of a third system, which is analogical no with reality, but with ""conventional"" parts of the textual or visual code. Since textual code is inherently conventional, one might be inclined to think it is better suited to programming languages than visual code, whose analogical properties are never used (visual programming languages use arrows and other conventional constructs, never representation of real things).<p>Moreover, textual code has what is called a metalinguistic property, meaning it can talk about itself but also about other codes (like visual code). Whereas a strictly analogical visual code cannot. Even a digital visual would be less effective since we already know the textual code's conventions but would have to learn the visual ones. And it is obvious that a programming language benefits greatly from metalinguistics (which sometimes goes by the name ""reflexion"", just consider macros).<p>Simply imagine the amount of work to implement lisp-like macros in a visual programming language, even if I think there are more intricate things to do in a visual programming language.<p>As a side note, remark that lisp macros could be made a lot more understandable with a more verbose syntax.<p>Speaking of which, it's interesting to note the article doesn't speak about conciseness (which as we all know from reading pg and personal experience is important :D). It's the trade-off for digital systems versus analogical systems : digital systems are harder to learn but are more powerful (because of new concepts) and easier (because of conciseness) to use once you know them.<p>And in the end, I just don't <i>feel</i> something graphic would be easier once you get past simple if/while statements.",1271524900

It's not surprising that when comparing these games to film, using that framing, that Ebert would find it lacking.<p>But what about a classic game like Super Mario Bros?  It doesn't have a complex story told on wordy fortune cookies, it's not trying to force a particularly complex emotional experience, and it's not beautiful in the way of modern games.  However, I'd still say that it's art.  A different kind of art.  One that's not comparable to film as so many examples here are.<p>Look at Mario himself: There are so few pixels to work with but not only is he clearly a human, he actually has character.  From his overalls to his 3 pixel mustache.  The world itself is a unique fantasy of plumbing, princesses, and mushrooms.  The music, due to technical limitations, is a bunch of repetitive beeps and boops but is infectious and never gets annoying even after days, months, even years of playing.  The shrubs and the clouds are the same -- something that went unnoticed by players for decades.  The first 5 seconds of the game shows you, not tells you, everything you need to know to play it.

I think reasonable people can disagree about this.<p>But if you care even a little bit about how your code fits into the marketplace, the AGPL is a fine choice, striking a balance between proprietary or restrictive licenses and ""yes, please rape me"" licenses like MIT.<p>That's not a knock against the BSD/MIT licenses.

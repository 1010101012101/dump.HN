8264577,comment,8263402,8263402,3,0,paperwork,,,"I once had to get my head around over 120k lines of complex, concurrent, buggy spaghetti Java code (for a real-time trading system).<p>My first attempt was to reverse engineer the code into a UML diagram. For some reason I keep making this mistake. A messy code base will result in an extremely messy diagram. It can give a few insights, but between finding a tool which will work and trying to make sense of a tangled mess of lines, visual diagrams usually aren&#x27;t worth the time.<p>I found that a tool called Chronon was somewhat useful (google &quot;DVR for Java&quot;). This tools just records a single run of a program. It is great for going forwards AND BACKWARDS and you step through the code, take a look at different threads, state of various objects, etc.<p>My strategy was to run the server and have it execute a small and simple bit of functionality (execute a single order). Follow it all the way from input to output. Make the scenario a bit more complex and follow that through to completion. This way you get to understand the core functionality, edge case code and start to get a sense of performance enhancements, etc.<p>I found myself making steady progress and fixing a number of bugs, until I hit heisenbugs, caused by overly clever concurrency/object pooling. It is enough to drain your soul :)",1409769970

The biggest pain is that they only support AT commands as a protocol. It&#x27;s very difficult to work with reliably, especially in a memory-constrained device. Whenever you issue a command, you need to check the next line to see whether it succeeded or failed, but the next line might be the response, or it might be an entirely unrelated unsolicited response (an asynchronous notification). You end up with either a complicated state machine or having to treat every command specially.<p>Even synchronizing the commands and responses is tricky, because you have to send an &#x27;AT&#x27; and wait for an &#x27;OK&#x27;, or if you didn&#x27;t get one, send an &#x27;AT&#x27; again. Then when you get an &#x27;OK&#x27;, is it from the first AT or the second one? So you have to spend a second eating all the data comes in before you can start sending commands for real. It&#x27;s all so... ugh.<p>I&#x27;d love for someone to implement a well-thought-out binary protocol as an alternative.<p>I see the example code give here just cheats and waits 100ms for each command to happen, then assumes it was successful and moves on to the next.",1409769632

However, they&#x27;re workable when both participants are willing. For pollution, only one participant is willing. The polluter doesn&#x27;t want to pay damages, you have to force him. Many people can come together to force one entity to do something (class action lawsuits) and one large entity can exert its power to force many people to do something (government), but it&#x27;s really hard for many people to force many other people to do something. When both the source of the pollution and the damage it causes is spread out, the cost of enforcement overwhelms the damages. Imagine a metro area with 100,000 road owners who are being held liable for pollution-related damages to five million local residents. How do the individual residents collect, when the individual road owners don&#x27;t want to pay? Do they sue each one for 1/100,000th of 1/5,000,000th of the total damages in the area? Traditionally, this is solved by the local residents organizing and then exercising power through that organization, i.e. government.",1409768644

I love open source software and use (and contribute to) it all the time, but the sad fact is that, despite the &quot;many eyeballs&quot; claim, most open source software is very rarely audited. I am willing to believe that KeePass is in fact implemented well and safe to use, but I don&#x27;t actually know anything about the developer(s) behind it, don&#x27;t know anything about the future development of the software (will it still be the same developers? Will new unknown people start contributing? etc), and pretty much the only thing that the developer(s) stand to lose by screwing up is reputation.<p>On the other hand, AgileBits (makers of 1Password) is a company, with actual money on the line (in addition to reputation) serving as an assurance that the product will not only continue to be developed, but will remain secure.<p>If KeePass screws up, some reputation is lost, people may switch to another product, and the developer(s) can just move on to working on other software if KeePass can&#x27;t be salvaged. If AgileBits screws up, not only is reputation lost, but so are paying customers, depending on the severity the entire company might go belly-up (e.g. if 1Password is compromised heavily enough that it can&#x27;t be trusted anymore), a lot of people are suddenly out of a job, etc. Basically, there&#x27;s a lot more at stake for AgileBits, which makes it much easier to trust that not only are they going to do their job right, but they&#x27;re also going to have processes in place to ensure a build never gets released externally that doesn&#x27;t pass QA, etc.<p>And don&#x27;t forget that as a paying customer of AgileBits, I can get support from them for any problem I might be having. Open source projects don&#x27;t typically employ support personnel, and generally rely on the community to try and provide whatever support they can.<p>---<p>Ultimately, this comes down to the fact that this is a specialized class of software, where one breach can mean irreparable damage as the attacker now has access to your passwords for everything. For that kind of software, I really want the backing of a company, with a significant amount to lose, rather than just some unknown collection of open source developers.<p>Which is to say, for nearly any other class of software, I&#x27;m much more inclined to judge it based on its merits, and open source has a lot of advantages.

8264415,comment,8263179,8263179,1,0,phireph0x,,,"I&#x27;ve owned 4 (!) different TI graphing calculators throughout the years.  I believe it started with the TI-85 in the mid-90s, followed by the 86, then the 92, and finally culminating with the TI-89 in 1999.  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve really surpassed the 89 in terms of functionality.  I ended up selling the 92, as it was replaced with the functionally-equivalent 89 (in the familiar TI form-factor), and gave the 85 to my sister, so today all that remains is the 89 and the 86.  I have fond memories of playing games and writing small programs on TI graphing calcs (ticalc.org still exists, apparently).  At first only BASIC programs were supported, but then some folks figured out how to hack the 85 to run assembly, which continued on the other models.  TI fought it at first, but later reluctantly supported assembly programs.  Some enterprising hackers managed to implement rudimentary audio support via the data port, which I thought was quite impressive.  The 84 Plus is essentially the old TI-82 platform iterated a number of times (TI-82, TI-83, 83 Plus, 83 Plus Silver, etc.)<p>I&#x27;ve been waiting for years for TI to make a graphing calc smartphone app, but with margins such as those described in the article, why would they?  It&#x27;ll likely take a major shift in the testing standards (i.e. allowing mobile devices) for this situation to change.  Test proctors might have to become more vigilant, but I imagine if airplane mode was strictly enforced, then smartphones might be allowed.  Seems that the communications features (which can facilitate cheating) are the primary concern.",1409767925

We try to help, get scared off when we get too close, then retreat to our safe enclaves of high pay and social walls -- then close the door behind us.

What does someone working for a funded startup cost?  $200K/yr if you skimp on office space?<p>Figure that as a bootstrapped company, you spend 1/3rd of your time earning money to feed yourself (Without dependents, you can live pretty okay off of 1/3rd of a competent coder&#x27;s salary, even in SV.) Note, it may be easier, say, if there are three of you to rent out one of you as a contractor full-time and use that money to pay everyone else, rather than all of you working for other people 1/3rd of the time.   Getting part-time work that pays good is a significant marketing effort, while $90/hr corp to corp full-time work is easily obtainable through the body shops.<p>So to compete with a company funded with a half-million bucks, you and your partners need to be willing to put in almost four years of your time.<p>this is not unreasonable.  I&#x27;ve done rather more than that.  and there are many advantages;  getting contracting work, in my experience, requires a hell of a lot less marketing effort than getting VC money.<p>Of course, the difficulty increases as your funded competitor gets more funding;   if, say, your competition has tens of millions in funding, say, rather than just half a million?  yeah, that&#x27;s going to be rather more difficult.",1409767246

Yet it is of utter importance they also get access to actual non-flat toys/tools/... in order to develop dexterity, the feeling to handle objects and even creativity. Also not to forget about getting enough movement/excercise and not getting used to a sedentary lifestyle: most tablet apps unfortunately don&#x27;t require the user to move around, on the contrary.",1430063971
9442145,comment,9440094,9440824,0,0,Bjartr,,,"Interestingly, the fact that the intersection feels confusing forces people to pay close attention to figure out what&#x27;s going on. That can lead to fewer accidents in some cases.<p>I can&#x27;t currently find it, but I once read about a roundabout that had accident problems, but had very good signage. People felt entirely in control going into it and weren&#x27;t paying as much attention as they could be. By removing the signage people wouldn&#x27;t inadvertently take for granted the behavior of the other drivers, they&#x27;d slow down more, they&#x27;d pay closer attention, and as a result the accident rate dropped.",1430063966
9442144,comment,9441827,9441827,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"I don&#x27;t think raw jQuery is often used to build full dynamic frontends and SPAs. It&#x27;s typically used to bolt on effects, transitions and asynchronous data fetching into otherwise statically generated server-side web pages.<p>Although SPAs, frontend frameworks and the model of communicating microservices is gaining lots of traction and visibility for web applications (particularly paid services that replace former desktop apps), plain old server-side CRUD that renders template variables from a data model is still going to be the dominant paradigm on the web at large, not to mention more of a conceptual neat fit to begin with.<p>In some ways I predict there will be a sort of resurgence in server-side CRUD frameworks again as being the hot trend you read about on HN, once people found out that you can easily build real-time, reactive UIs without having to context switch and directly deal with the often subpar client-side interfaces. Furthermore, the act of generating HTML and JavaScript from native language constructs will be lauded as a great time-saver, not to mention giving the same benefits of the so-called &quot;isomorphism&quot; that platforms like Node are hailed for. For examples of these concepts, see the Nitrogen and N2O frameworks (both Erlang).",1430063957

Or at least, it holds that they <i>ought to be</i> once we stop being silly and think clearly.<p>Most everything we&#x27;ve ever learned in machine-learning and cognitive science instead tell us that concepts/categories are <i>statistical</i>, and that formal logic is therefore not only a brittle framework for real-world reasoning but thoroughly incapable of describing where its own constituent objects come from in the mind.",1430063940

If you&#x27;re a beginner at Linux, and want to learn more I would highly recommend Arch to you. Arch was the first *nix system I ever installed by hand (OS X doesn&#x27;t count), and even as a developer, I learned more spending 3 weeks installing the OS than I&#x27;d ever known about linux previously.<p>I&#x27;m a big supporter of the mentality that you should know the stack you&#x27;re working on (regardless of OS), and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s too easy nowadays to ignore all the important frameworks and libraries that the tools you&#x27;re using are built on. Arch forces you to understand them, because you can&#x27;t just &quot;guess&quot; your way through. The thing I loved about installing it most was that on my 3rd and 4th attempt I realized how fun it was to just break stuff to figure out how it works. I&#x27;d never had the chance to do that to an OS. You learn how to diagnose errors, how to discover them, what to Google, and why it happened in the first place.<p>Understandably, most people might not be in the job situation where they need to do something as time consuming as install Arch as a dev environment, but I think that if you want to learn about operating systems, in a structured and incredibly well documented environment, Arch is unparalleled.",1430063909
9442140,comment,9441187,9441979,0,0,MetaCosm,,,"> I take serious issue with the &quot;lesson&quot; that this article is trying to teach at the end, which is that you should not generalize your particular problem into something abstract...<p>The problem, simply stated by Emil Persson is &quot;Premature optimizations can be troublesome to revert, but premature generalizations are often near impossible.&quot;<p>Or, less delicately phrased by Chris Eric -- &quot;Premature optimization, that&#x27;s like a fart. Premature abstraction is like taking a dump on another developer&#x27;s desk.&quot;<p>The root problem is -- you think you know all the possible use cases, you don&#x27;t.  You think you can see the future, you can&#x27;t.  Solve for what is in front of you -- abstract it when you need to for reuse.<p>As for Alan Kay and his fight against complexity (which is fair and nobel fight, great video on it: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/82301919"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/82301919</a>) -- he is arguing for the RIGHT abstractions from the perspective of DSLs ... with all the good (and very, very bad) that entails.  That said, it is 7 levels of bullshit when you get down to &quot;deploy to metal&quot;.  Sure, it is a few hundred lines of code for a DSL and OMeta to render geometry -- but skip to 1:40:00 for the real scoop.  It was incredibly hard to get to run with any level of performance on ACTUAL hardware in the REAL world.  Alan Kay even puts forth that you should always keep the option of &quot;rolling your own hardware&quot;, which sadly speaks to a disconnect with ACTUAL software development (and hardware development for that matter).  There is no doubt he is a legend of CS (and brilliant), but I simply think his perspective is too far away from reality.<p>&quot;Software does not run in a magic fairy aether powered by the fevered dreams of CS PhDs.&quot; -- Mike Acton (<a href=""https://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc</a>)",1430063907

9442115,comment,9441245,9441556,0,0,lambda,,,"It&#x27;s frustrating having the proliferation of different package managers.<p>Each one can work well in isolation; but when you then need to integrate with your platform package manager or another language&#x27;s package manager, you get a combinatorial explosion of possible interactions.<p>One example that I&#x27;ve been particularly frustrated by recently is Python/Emacs integration. I have Emacs and Python installed via my system package manager (apt). Then there are a bunch of Emacs modes that I need to install via the Emacs package manager (elpy and its dependencies). Those in turn have dependencies on Python packages (rope/flake8). And finally I have a bunch of different python packages that I work on that are all linked to from a virtualenv so that they&#x27;ll all resolve properly in all of those tools.<p>If I upgrade one part of that system (apt, emacs packages, python packages), it frequently breaks other parts, because there aren&#x27;t any proper dependencies between them. I then have to spend a while fiddling with the whole setup to get it back up and running again.<p>Basically, the more package managers you have, the less value they have. The whole point of package managers is to manage a whole set of packages together, so you don&#x27;t have to manually go through and resolve all of the dependencies yourself, manually figure out which version of this package goes with what version of that package. But every time there is some dependency between two different package managers, that breaks down.<p>Another part of the frustration is that they are all basically doing the same thing, but with slightly different implementations. In the end, a package manager&#x27;s purpose is to let you figure out which packages you need, by resolving dependencies while honoring version constraints, fetch those packages from an archive somewhere (and verify that they are intact and haven&#x27;t been tampered with), unpack them and install the files in the right places, and run some glue code to set up indexes, documentation, and so on appropriately. The only part of that task which really needs to differ between package managers is that glue code, plus the policies for inclusion in the centralized archive; everything else is basically solving the same problem in a whole bunch of slightly different ways (different ways of representing and comparing version numbers, different ways of verifying package integrity, different ways of doing local mirrors, etc), and so you get a whole bunch of incompatible and differently buggy implementations of the same kinds of things, or some functionality just missing from certain package managers.<p>What I would really like to see is a single unified package manager core, that handles all of the basic functionality that they all set out to solve, with the ability to utilize multiple different repositories (so that different projects could have their own policies for inclusion and sets of packages that are designed to work together), and appropriate places to hook in all of the language (or distro) specific glue that you need. I&#x27;ve been mulling over trying to write such a package manager, but of course when doing so you need to be careful or you will run into this problem: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/927/</a>",1430063552

But they can also optionally provide different kinds of visual feedback including traditional pop-up menu windows [1 @ 4:30], cursor icons [2 @ 4:40], drawing strokes and animated overlays (i.e. pac-man [1 @ 8:35], precision [1 @ 13:12], window management [3 @ 2:08]), and &quot;direct manipulation&quot; real-time in-world continuous feedback (i.e. object rotation tool [2 @ 4:40], font style selection [4 @ 1:55]).<p>[1] <a href=""http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/video/1991/1991_piemenus.mpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/video/1991/1991_piemenus.mpg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/TheSimsPieMenus.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/TheSimsPieMenus.mov</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/TabWindowDemo.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/TabWindowDemo.mov</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/JavaScriptPieMenus.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/JavaScriptPieMenus.mov</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cu_1vTNPw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cu_1vTNPw</a><p>The Sims supports two different kinds of pie menus:<p>1) The round pop-up menu windows that you get when you right click on an object to select an available action [2 @ 2:12], with a head in the middle, surrounded by text item labels.<p>2) Also the direct manipulation &quot;object rotation tool&quot; that lets you turn an object around to face four different directions [2 @ 4:40], which uses audio and cursor feedback plus in-world &quot;direct manipulation&quot; feedback by rotating the object itself in real time.<p>Operationally, the object rotation tool tracks exactly like a four-item pie menu sliced vertically and horizontally, with a small inactive region in the center. But visually it&#x27;s so obvious what it does that there&#x27;s no need to pop up a window with labels.<p>Real time visual feedback previewing the effect of the gesture in the world is the ideal direct visual representation, so if there&#x27;s a good way to obviously and unambiguously represent the menu actions directly, like applying attribute changes to text [4 @ 1:55], it renders distracting pop-up windows unnecessary (or optional and useful for training).<p>In 1988, the HyperTIES hypermedia browser [6] supported pie menus with directional flicking gestures and mouse-ahead display pre-emption for paging forward and back (left and right), navigating the history, selecting which window to open a link in, and user defined menus with feedback based on continuous direction and distance (color hue/saturation/brightness [1 @ 10:42], font family/style/size [1 @ 12:14], etc).<p>[6] <a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/home/ties/LookBackAtHyperTIES.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/home/ties/LookBackAtHyperTIES.html</a><p>>Designing to facilitate browsing: A look back at the Hyperties workstation browser. Ben Shneiderman, Catherine Plaisant, Rodrigo Botafogo, Don Hopkins, William Weiland.<p>>Pie menus to permit low cognitive load actions:<p>>To avoid distraction of common operations such as page turning or window selection, pie menus were used to provide gestural input. This rapid technique avoids the annoyance of moving the mouse or the cursor to stationary menu items at the top or bottom of the screen.<p>>3. PIE MENUS TO PERMIT LOW COGNITIVE LOAD ACTION<p>>The Hyperties browser uses pie menus as accelerators, to make commonly used commands quickly and easily available. A pie menu is a type of pop up menu whose selections are laid out in a circle around the menu center (18). The menu pops up centered on the cursor, so that each selection is adjacent to the cursor but in a different direction (Figure 1 and 6). A selection is made by moving the cursor in the direction of the desired selection, and clicking. Experienced pie menu users can make selections from familiar menus quickly and reliably without even having to look at the menu, because the menu selection depends on the direction between the two mouse clicks that invoke and select from the menu. The distance of cursor motion does not effect the selection, but the further away from the center the cursor is, the more precise the control of the selection is.<p>>The browser has a control panel at the bottom of the screen, with buttons showing the names of available commands, to turn the page, return to the previous article, show the index, etc. When users are browsing a document by pointing and clicking on highlighted text links in the main contents window, they move the cursor down to the bottom of the screen to press buttons in the control panel, and back up to continue browsing. The permanent display of those controls is important for the novice and occasional users. On the other hand, pop up menus reduce the distraction of moving the cursor by making these commands available wherever the cursor currently is. This reduces perceptual and motor load. Pie menus are arranged with their items in easy to remember directions. For example the BACK page turning commands are to the left (and the NEXT page is to the right) (Figure 6). This arrangement facilitates gestural input and encourages development of muscle memory. Experienced users can make gestural selections from these menus so comfortably and rapidly that it is often unnecessary to display the menu. This is called &quot;mouse ahead display suppression&quot;, and its point is to reduce the perceptual distraction.",1430063216

Meanwhile, non-embedded software on workstations was growing, theories were developing, algorithms and organization and business models were applied.  And firmware grew and grew, but mostly like an engine grows in that abstractions are minimized, optimization happens in-place and theory is largely tribal knowledge.<p>It&#x27;s only in the last 10 years or so that firmware has metamorphosis end and is confronting other software.

9441979,comment,9441187,9441187,0,0,drostie,,,"I take serious issue with the &quot;lesson&quot; that this article is trying to teach at the end, which is that you should not generalize your particular problem into something abstract, solve that abstract problem really well, and then solve your particular problem as an instance of that problem.<p>Modeling your problem as FizzBuzz is a good way to model an unrealistically simple problem. FizzBuzz itself is only meant to filter out the vast masses of applicants who are struggling to find <i>anything</i> in the job market and therefore apply to any job they see hoping that someone will recognize them and take pity on them. It&#x27;s not a realistic starting point.<p>Alan Kay&#x27;s words are really insightful on this matter; he says that &quot;the right perspective is worth 80 points of IQ.&quot; If you can figure out the right way to look at the problem (the right generic problem to solve given your specific constraints) then it&#x27;s like being much smarter than any ordinary programmer really is.<p>He gives a much more instructive example: the Windows operating system. This thing is millions of lines of code, so much that if you printed it out in textbooks it&#x27;d stretch to the top of the Empire State Building. This was produced by a bunch of people doing exactly what Tom Dalling is suggesting: work only on your specific subproblem, do not solve the generic problems of &quot;how do I make an operating system?&quot;, etc. There&#x27;s no <i>intrinsic</i> reason that a graphical operating system needs to be so big that nobody can read it in a lifetime.<p>And the bugs that exist in Windows are undebuggable. With that many different components at play in the greater ecosystem, knowing which two are interacting to cause the problems that plague you requires an unbelievable amount of insight into what the computer is doing when it performs those quirks.<p>I agree with the specific point that <i>software bloat</i> sucks; I&#x27;m working with Ext.JS right now and boy is it bloated with internal abstractions that don&#x27;t make much sense. Fortunately they isolate other people from dealing with those abstractions, but if I were at Sencha developing on the product I&#x27;d constantly be wondering &quot;why do we make an &#x27;Operation object&#x27; for the thing that the user wants to do? What&#x27;s the real point of that?&quot; etc.",1430060645

9441977,comment,9441500,9441725,0,0,swombat,,,"I wonder how you would feel if the reciprocal attitude was adopted by your employer - i.e. if they continually interviewed potential replacements for your position, to:<p>* get practice at interviewing people for your role<p>* have an idea of what your market worth is, so they can use this in salary negotiations<p>* stop interviews being a difficult process they only do when you leave<p>* keep the option of finding a better candidate and replacing you on such occasions.<p>I&#x27;m going to take a wild guess and assume you would not tolerate that from your employer. It would show a lack of respect, trust, engagement, etc, basically it would convey to you that your employer doesn&#x27;t even care about maintaining an appearance of giving a damn about you as a person. You&#x27;ve only just started there last week, and they&#x27;re already thinking about firing you and replacing you with someone better.<p>Personally, whilst I think the attitude of getting upset because someone leaves the company is immature, I also think your attitude is disrespectful and shows such a contempt for the place where you&#x27;re working, such an extreme lack of even the remotest sense of loyalty, that I wouldn&#x27;t want to employ someone with your attitude ever.<p>This is without even delving into the fact that you&#x27;re imposing a tax on the system, taking time away from your current employer (presumably with this attitude you&#x27;re quite happy to pull sickies to cover your frequent job interviews), as well as other potential employers (interviewing people costs time and money; interviewing people who have no interest in changing jobs is a total waste of money for the company). If everyone suddenly behaved like you, regularly applying to even just a dozen jobs a year even though they have no intention of changing jobs, the recruitment process would incur such gargantuan costs that the economy would suffer, if not crash. Basically, your suggestion above seems to convey that you only really care about yourself. At least that&#x27;s what it makes me feel from the really self-centred way you&#x27;ve described it.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that this reads like a personal accusation, but you made statements about your personal system of behaviour and I find that system deeply objectionable.<p>If I got the wrong end of the stick (perfectly possible), please do correct me...",1430060622

The importance of ubiquity should not be discounted. Many languages have succeeded in their target markets on this basis alone, and Javascript may certainly be one of them! But let&#x27;s not forget that, in almost every other way, it falls short of ideal.<p>Some examples:<p>* Very difficult to parse (while not strictly necessary for a compilation <i>target</i>, still very helpful)<p>* Esoteric type conversion system (leads to bugs)<p>* Lack of integral type (this can be worked around, but the fact that it needs to be worked around makes it a bad target).<p>* Highly dynamic type system (makes it difficult to optimize code, and a good compilation target should be easy to optimize)<p>* Paucity of parsers (I may be wrong, but to my knowledge, there are very few parsers that are neither (A) written in Javascript, or (B) developed as part of a browser rendering engine[0]. If I remember correctly, Facebook&#x27;s Flow is one of the rare counterexamples[1].)<p>* Single-threaded runtime (makes it challenging to implement languages that explicitly allow parallel execution as part of their semantics)<p>There are ways to address each of these. For example, asm.js limits the scope of the language with the goal of increasing performance of a subset of the language. But they&#x27;re still shortcomings that have to be dealt with in the first place.<p>Not that any compilation target is perfect in all of the above ways, but Javascript&#x27;s combination of all of these makes it a very frustrating choice.<p>[0] For example, V8 and Spidermonkey were both originally motivated by Firefox and Chrome. The fact that so few people attempt to write their own (except in Javascript), even for fun/experimentation, should give a very rough indication of how challenging it is.<p>[1] Someone may be able to provide clarity on this: I know Flow is written in OCaml, and I know that at least some of the parsing happens in OCaml, but I also know that Spidermonkey is involved somehow. Is it just that the AST produced is identical to the Spidermonkey AST, or does it actually use Spidermonkey itself at some part of the parsing process?",1430060450

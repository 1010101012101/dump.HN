922468,comment,921592,922337,0,0,jriddycuz,,,"I guess it really just depends on what motivates you. Grades never motivated me, and I never felt like my academic peers and I were ""like-minded"", so school ended up feeling more like an impediment to my education than an enlightening experience.<p>There are certainly problems with learning on your own, not the least of which is maintaining the drive to push through the icky parts. But in the absence of external motivational structures, you can give your self-discipline a workout. I'm not a particularly disciplined person, but I can still commit to doing 1 hour of math a day. I guess I think of it like my daily mental exercise. It's hard to develop this habit though, and if you can't, school's not a bad option.<p>One of the other problems with learning math on your own is not having anyone to ask questions. To help with this, I've actively tried to make friends (of sorts) with math professors at a nearby school. I get lunch with one every once in a while, and we talk about sports and life and math. This can kinda substitute for the community of like-minded people that school provides.<p>All this goes to say is that you have to be aware of how you learn and how you get motivated. If you are externally driven, and don't mind learning at a pace you did not establish, school will be useful to you. If you don't <i>grok</i> extrinsic motivation, school's rough and you should learn on your own.",1257364734

Perhaps the best in the world. if you get a takedown for political speech, nearly any small provider would be happy to fight for you, because it's wonderful publicity.   (I say small provider, because in order to fight for you, someone with enough authority to do so has got to see the takedown, and decide it is bogus.  At large companies, the people reading the takedown often don't have authority to decide to fight or not.  the same incentive applies, though, so if someone at a large corporation with authority saw a bogus takedown for political speech, they might make the same decision a small provider would.)<p>I know I'd be happy to defend original political speech against a bogus takedown notice... not because I'm patriotic or altruistic, but because the publicity would be priceless.  this is America, and my customers are nerds;  being at the center of some scandal where the feds were trying to shut down some opposing political viewpoint would be incredible, from a self-promotion standpoint.<p>America becomes a bad place when you want some kind of commercial speech (or when your 'political' speech is commercial... but even then, so long as it's clear you have a valid claim and are not just copying someone else's copywritten work, it's pretty easy to find a provider willing to fight for you in order to garner the positive publicity.)<p>I might be willing to stand up for political speech, but I'm going to cooperate with taking down customers who want to violate trademarks to sell knock-off goods (knock-off goods are fine, just don't violate trademarks.)  I'm also not going to spend a penny defending people who want to share movies or other copywritten data.  Right or wrong, that's not a fight I can win here in America.<p>I keep telling my customers this;  if you want to say something politically controversial, do so here.  if you want to copy the latest movies, etc... host in eastern Europe or china, and don't involve me.",1257363323

Instead, they compute the difference in the received timestamps, which gives the difference in the distances to the satellites.  That puts you on a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Enough of them and you can pin down your location.<p>Some GPS units work by iterating to a solution, effectively computing the time, but it's not as easy as simply knowing the time and computing the distances.<p>The real explanation is more complex, and way cooler.

922363,comment,922198,922198,0,0,jz,,,"About 4 years ago, I was 22 at the time, I started experiencing pain in my right wrist and forearm. Once the pain became unbearable, I started using the mouse with my left hand. Almost immediately I experienced pain in my left wrist and forearm. Initially I thought it was Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I went to physical therapy 3 times a week for about 6 months with little or no benefit. I started reading books on RSI, trigger points, and myofascial pain. I was afraid that I would need to switch careers (I'm a programmer). My attitude towards work changed drastically and my want to use a computer outside of work became nil. I started cutting out of work early and going to more meetings. I did anything that would keep me away from the computer. Driving became painful. I had to quit lifting weights and playing sports since they worsened the pain. I then saw a surgeon who (you guessed it) said I needed surgery on my forearms. I left his office confused and psychologically broken. I decided surgery would be my last resort and I would try any noninvasive approach. I enrolled in physical therapy (different therapist) for another 3 months and stopped going. This round of therapy was actually making the pain and numbness worse. I tried wrist braces which also made the pain worse. My wife found a myofasical treatment center in Chicago (<a href=""http://www.myopain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myopain.com/</a>). After my 1 hour visit, the intensity of the pain decreased. I left armed with the knowledge to treat my pain. That was almost 2 years ago and I have been virtually pain free. I had a week where the pain started coming back about 6 months ago. I went back in for another hour appointment and she diagnosed my problem again. So to sum things up:<p>* I started experiencing pain in my wrists and forearms about 4 years ago<p>* After 6 months, the pain became so intense I started working less and avoided my computer as much as possible<p>* Went to physical therapy where they misdiagnosed my problem<p>* Stopped physical therapy after 6 months or so<p>* Was recommended to a surgeon who (big surprise) wanted to do surgery.<p>* Tried a different physical therapist<p>* Tried wrist braces<p>* Went to the myo pain center in Chicago <a href=""http://www.myopain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myopain.com/</a><p>* I was able to treat myself after a 1 hour visit at the myopain center\n* Went from being able to work on a computer unbearably 35 hours a week to 70+ virtually pain free (when I worked for a YC startup)<p>* I now work from home and have made some ergonomic changes that have also helped:<p><i></i> The top of my monitor is at eye level.<p><i></i> I use a trackball and the Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard.<p><i></i> I got an overstuffed thick pillow which helped support my neck when sleeping on my side.<p><i></i> I use this book to find and treat the trigger points: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Treatment/dp/1572243759/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257359906&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Tr...</a>",1257361913

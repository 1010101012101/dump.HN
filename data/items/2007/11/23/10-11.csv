What I don't get: how do you get a significant number of ""friends"" on those networks who are willing to watch/read your spam? <p>My real life friends typically don't use social networks and, not being entrepreneuers themselves, they often did not get the point when I asked them to get a stumbleupon account just to rate my site. On the other hand, I could not yet muster the motivation to worm my account onto some other people's friends list just to make them rate my submissions. <p>How do you handle that problem? Perhaps a ""entrepreneur helps entrepreneur"" network for those things would be in order?",1195813268

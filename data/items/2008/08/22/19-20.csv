But I look at things like the official Apple support for MacRuby (Apple is employing Laurent to re-implement ruby in Objective C, so that ruby objects are Objective C objects - you'll be able to program Cocoa in Ruby without having to take the performance hit of crossing a scripting bridge all of the time!), and I don't see a commensurate support of the Python world.

Do you think some kind of secret trade-off where corporations got to kill vast numbers of people secretly in the middle of the night to keep prices low would actually work for _any_ corporation?</i><p>How could you keep a people supporting your government if you were killing people running it? Do you think some kind of secret trade-off where the government got to kill vast numbers of people secretly in the middle of the night to keep your standard of living high would actually work for _any_ government?<p>I don't make the same nebulous distinction between governments and other entities.  A government is just type of corporation that is allowed to kill/incarcerate people.<p>I hope you don't think I am anti-corporate.  Quite the opposite, I think that the shared stock company is responsible in large part for the civilization we see today.  Feudalism would have continued indefinitely until the markets were allowed to take over.  And I think that government should be run like corporation: the interests of the shareholders is made explicit and shares can be bought and sold on the open market.  The job of the CEO is to maximize revenue and only shareholders have a say in whether the CEO is doing a good job or not.  This is in essence what we have now with congress playing the role of CEO and special interest groups playing the role of shareholders.  The only difference is that everything would be formalized and transparent.<p>And yes, I do a LOT of reading on the history of government, specifically between the renaissance and the 18th century.  Read enough and you'll start to see that democracy is a type of fascism.  It is a fascism of public opinion but fascism none the less.  Our capitalist republic government is not quite as bad as a democracy but it is also not a stable entity, it is a delicate balance between the powers of mob rule and that of individual liberties.",1219433595

For $80 bucks it's an absolute steal.<p>The toners aren't free, but the price per page is very very low. I think it's in the top 5 of home laser printers. We're talking a few cents per copy here (including paper). A great deal once again. I researched the different printers before I bought one, and I knew full well that Brother can't make much profit on the laser printer itself - so the toners are more expensive. This is great, because this way people who print only semi-regularly can still get affordable laser printers.<p>Manjoo the author agrees with me: great printer and very inexpensive. So what makes the author think he is getting cheated? Why does he think Brother owes him anything? Why does he feel so outraged? The guy would be HAPPY if the toner ran out 20% earlier, but then he'd have faded pages for a while. Brother decides to put some more ink in there (doesn't cost them much) so the quality is high all the way to the end, and then the toner shuts down.<p>""Fight back against the lying infuriating evil ink-and-toner cabal?"".

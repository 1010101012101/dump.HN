10634459,comment,10634359,10634359,0,0,rubyfan,,,"In practice most programmers are business application developers and don&#x27;t need the education a CS degree demands. If you really want CS degree skills then I&#x27;d assume you want a job in bio/pharma/physics, etc. and if that&#x27;s the case just go get the degree. CS focuses heavily on math and algorithms, if you want those skills then learn discrete math, calculus, etc.<p>If you want to compete against Joe average programmer with a degree then just learn Java or .Net plus the latest greatest technology fad offering (think Hadoop, Node/Angular/React, Rails back in the day, etc). From there you should have no trouble finding a startup company or a small contracting outfit with ties to bigger consultants serving enterprise clients. If you&#x27;re good then accept a right-to-hire situation and an enterprise IT shop will pick you up.<p>Don&#x27;t sell yourself short and don&#x27;t take shitty odd consulting jobs from small businesses because you feel inadequate due to lack of degree. Create demand for your skill and reap the rewards. At the end of the day you will likely be the only one who cares about the degree.",1448567866

Seems like a good choice. Not sure how it compares to something like ChaCha20 on performance, but I&#x27;m guessing it compares favorably (though it&#x27;s unlikely to be your bottleneck either way).<p>Since I wrote the above linked article there&#x27;s been a bunch of discussion, some of which has been about using crypto to back Math.random(). I&#x27;m sort of torn on that front - I feel like a good PRNG is useful for some stuff (like array shuffles), but maybe not? Maybe there are undiscovered (or even discovered, but not well known) vulnerabilities that justify CSPRNG even there, as there are with hash collision vulnerabilities.<p>Anyways, what I learned is that the benchmarks (particularly SunSpider, it seems) are putting pressure on implementors to (over)emphasize Math.random() performance, but nothing is really pressuring them to produce good quality. Sounds like the best thing to do might be to put some quality requirements in the ECMA spec to balance the performance pressures. Check out my recent Twitter likes for more details.

Champion racewalkers can average more than 14 kilometres per hour (8.7 mph) over a distance of 20 kilometres (12 mi). ...<p>> Power walking or speed walking is the act of walking with a speed at the upper end of the natural range for walking gait, typically 7 to 9 km/h (4.5 to 5.5 mph).<p>Quoting from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_walking_speed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_walking_speed</a> :<p>> Many people tend to walk at about 1.4 m/s (5.0 km/h; 3.1 mph).

It&#x27;s awesome this is being done in a community driven fashion. Once these issues are worked out, it would mean the existence of a very flexible componentized UI system. In other words it&#x27;s on par with web assembly in terms of creating a de facto universal virtual machine, but in this case a universal graphical system. Yes it&#x27;ll have warts, and painful spots, but that will be far outdated that there will be multiple implementations based on a living specification. E.g. Many of the things that made PC architecture great should apply here. I think it&#x27;s already started with the rise of clojurescript, typescript, and llvm ecmascript emitter.<p>I&#x27;ve been toying around with the idea of implementing an actor style computation framework on top of web components. In this area details like instantiate in order become crucial. It&#x27;s a bit odd to see the subtree notification order down on the &quot;other items&quot; list.<p>Has anyone else made progress in applying an actor computational model on components? In particular in embedding nomadic data into them via message passing? A lot of interesting work has been happening in formalizing data processing in combination with closures [1,2].

10634295,comment,10634053,10634263,0,0,dsacco,,,"Well, that entirely depends on your goals, budget and location.<p>Do you want a made to measure suit, tailored to your body? Or do you want a bespoke suit (mostly the same, but tailored entirely by hand).<p>If you&#x27;re in America and you&#x27;d like an entry level &quot;luxury&quot; made to measure suit, Brooks Brothers is nice at $1500/suit or so. You can also try for other luxury brands, up to and including Tom Ford, at $40,000/suit (or more).<p>For a bespoke suit you can spend anywhere from $2000 (cheap) to mid five figures. Saville Row in London is &quot;the place&quot; to go for these, but if you&#x27;re in America there are many small shops in New York City across all sorts of price ranges.<p>In general a bespoke suit is better than a merely made to measure suit (at least financially it has a better cost justification and there is an &quot;experience&quot; factor), and a brand name is commonly thought of as less desirable than an independent tailor.<p>Beyond that it&#x27;s harder to give a good answer without more detail on what you want, how much you can spend and where you are. Personally I&#x27;d never get a suit at Men&#x27;s Wearhouse, I have found the attention to detail and patronage there is lacking. At the absolute bottom in terms of price, mysuit.com is nice for bang for your buck factor.<p>My personal recommendation is to spend the money on a bespoke suit, all things being equal. An experienced tailor making a bespoke suit will cost more, but will more easily achieve an attractive and comfortable fit than a machine will. You also have much greater choice.<p>In my opinion, paying for a made to measure suit is only slightly better than buying off the rack. Bespoke suits are <i>usually</i> offered by independent tailors, not larger brand names. This means that bespoke suits are <i>usually</i> expensive due to the skilled labor costs associated with making a fitted suit by hand. But a made to measure suit is <i>usually</i> just a higher offering than an off the rack suit at a brand name luxury store (Brooks Brothers, Emporio Armani, Canali, Brioni, Zegna, etc.). In other words, you pay for some tailoring skill and a lot of brand name. I&#x27;d rather spend $5000 on a bespoke suit from an obscure but skilled tailor on Saville Row than $5000 on a made to measure Canali.<p>I encourage everyone who can to purchase bespoke or made to measure suits, however. I find tailored suits so comfortable that I enjoy wearing them. The signaling effect is also nice. You can clearly tell the difference between a suit off the rack and a suit that has been tailored to a custom fit. If you spring for higher quality materials you can vastly improve the durability and comfort as well.<p>If you&#x27;d like a few exact brands to check out, indiscriminate of price:<p>• Bespoke suits - Huntsman, Gieves & Hawkes<p>• Made to measure suits - Brooks Brothers, Canali<p>• Tailored shirts - Thomas Pink, Turnbull & Asser<p>• Ties - Hermes, Drake&#x27;s of London<p>• Shoes - John Lobb, Stefanelli, Bemer<p>Hope this helps you out.<p>EDIT: petewailes also has good advice in this subthread",1448565634

There&#x27;s an irony here.<p>So the first thing is to understand the kind of tailoring you&#x27;re after. There&#x27;s a difference between fully bespoke and having adjustments made. The latter is 98% of the fit that you&#x27;ll get, with a shorter time to wait, and you&#x27;ll be wearing similar things before which can give you a better idea of what you&#x27;ll end up with if you haven&#x27;t bought a fully tailored suit before.<p>The second thing is to consider what you&#x27;re buying for. There&#x27;s a difference, obviously, between buying for a daily suit to wear, and purchasing for a more formal or occasion specific outfit (for example, a white tie event suit with tails).<p>That being said, here&#x27;s some general pointers.<p>Wool is worth the money. It wears well, it&#x27;s classic, and it&#x27;ll be able to adjust nicely if you put on or lose weight/muscle. A good navy or charcoal wool suit as a daily is a solid choice. Look for a good weight in a daily wear. 8-10oz would be my choice.<p>Jacket: partially or ideally fully canvased would by my choice. It&#x27;s more expensive but harder wearing, and it&#x27;ll mould to.the shape of your body better. It&#x27;ll also generally have better definition and shape.<p>Ask what will be hand sewn. More fiddly areas like the cuffs and collar will get a better fit if hand finished. On a similar note, think about what you want in terms of a style considering your body shape. If you&#x27;re leaner, a suit with narrow darts and some padding in the shoulder will accentuate the torso. Pinstripes have a similar effect, in lengthening the body. Talk to your tailor and get recommendations based on your particular body shape. For example, I&#x27;m tall bit broad shouldered, so I tend to go for a smaller card shoulder pad, to allow for definition but still create mobility in the arms.<p>Now, for more formal wear, you&#x27;re going to be getting more expensive. Similar considerations apply, but think about the whole outfit. What shoes you&#x27;ll be wearing will influence fabric colour choice. Is it white or black tie? Bow tie or less formal?<p>For a full white tie outfit, for example, you&#x27;ll want to think about how often you&#x27;ll wear it. There&#x27;s places you can save money, in terms of garment longevity if you aren&#x27;t planning on wearing regularly. For example, lighter wools will cost less (essentially you&#x27;re buying less material, and the thinner wools are easier to work).<p>Also, plan to spend some time. A full fitting will be between 30-50ish measurements, depending on your size and body shape. That takes time. Ask about how many times you&#x27;ll need to be fitted. Assume twice, but a larger person may need three or four.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d generally say classic for formal and daily, but modern for events. For example, if I&#x27;m attending a more relaxed business event, I&#x27;ll wear a Saville Row with a particularly bright lining, or perhaps something with a more interesting outer fabric.<p>If you want to chat more, feel free to email me.<p>Apologies for any typos - on my mobile.",1448565197

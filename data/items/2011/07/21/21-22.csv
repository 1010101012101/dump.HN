2791466,comment,2791293,2791293,9,0,FaceKicker,,,"The article mentions writing down one of your application-specific passwords, but this is a silly argument, as the entire intention behind the application-specific passwords is that they are only ever seen/used once.<p>You copy/paste the password it gives you into Pidgin (or whatever you're using it for) and then click ""hide"" on the box that displays the password, and then you can <i>never see it again</i>.  If you trust the machine you're entering in the password so little that you're worried about keyloggers (which copying and pasting might take care of, but I don't know enough about how copy/paste works or how keyloggers work to say), then (1) you should probably not be using that machine to access accounts that you care enough to use two-factor authentication on (because for all you know someone could have installed remote desktop software that would allow them to take control of your accounts the second after you log in, for example), and (2) you can revoke the application-specific password so that they will never work again.<p>Obviously, using application-specific passwords does make your account less secure, but without them, every single client application, e.g., Pidgin, would need to implement Google's two-factor authentication system in order to be usable.  As a user, you are free to choose not to use application-specific passwords at all and get the same security you would if Google had chosen not to allow these application-specific passwords; you just won't be able to use any client applications that don't support them.",1311285393

In simple terms, you need to push your max all the time; as you get stronger and develop more muscle, you need to keep increasing the resistance to reach the next level. This is very well established in scientific studies.<p>Simple logic dictates that this is is impossible with pushups. You cannot change the resistance without changing what muscles you activate, and an averagely built male can do more than 8-12 pushups per set from the very get go. The only way forward is to increase the amount of pushups you do in one go, and that throws hypertrophy out the window.<p>This is why pushups is a rather useless exercise, beside the fact that it's difficult to do correctly and causes injuries (doing them on your palms can fuck up your rotator cuff, and doing them on your knuckles can fuck up your hands and wrists).<p>But even without scientific proof, I think most people have this experience with pushups (whether they've thought about it consciously or not): the people who do them are rarely very big, they're the thin traditional martial-arts type, at best.",1311284245

One of them is already dim, and it's dominated by the brighter one so you don't normally see it.  (Sometimes in the right light you can see both reflections at once.)  The two reflections are offset, so that when the bright reflection is showing you the view out the rear window, the dim reflection is showing you a few degrees lower, probably the back seat.  When you flip the dimming button, the mirror turns upward a few degrees, so that the dim reflection is now showing you the view out the rear window.  You can't see the bright reflection any more because it's now showing you the roof inside the car, which is pretty dark in relation to the rear window.  Now the ""dim"" reflection is actually bright enough to dominate.<p>I assume that this is accomplished with some sort of double mirror, where the ""bright"" mirror is closer to you, and some light leaks through it to hit the ""dim"" mirror behind.  These could be made into a single unit with no actual space between them.  It just needs two layers of reflective material that are at slightly different angles.",1311283916

2791369,comment,2790023,2790023,1,0,silencio,,,"> Virgin America, which sells early boarding as part of a perks package to customers who buy seats with extra legroom, experimented with giving early boarding to passengers who didn't bring large bags on board. That showed promise for speeding up boarding, but because it was unfamiliar to customers; it slowed down some people and offset gains, a spokeswoman said.<p>This bothers me to no end. I fly Virgin 1-2x roundtrips a month, and I've seen this program put into place very erratically. If they wanted to see results, they should have offered that on all flights for a certain period of time, instead of only here and there and mentioning it only once after boarding priority. A lot of the time, it was only mentioned when they wanted people on a full flight to gate check their carryons, and then they forgot to mention it again before boarding the first group (after priority/families/special needs) at all.<p>The other half of the problem was that some people decided that ""one carryon that goes under the seat in front of you"" meant 1 personal item plus 1 carryon (e.g. your usual limitation). So you basically had like 5-6 idiots with the largest carryon bags possible and a ginormous purse or shopping bag getting into the line with the people with only one backpack or carrying a laptop sleeve, and these weren't people with priority boarding or special needs. The Virgin employees never said anything to them, if they even noticed the extra bags.<p>I wonder why it offset gains, I really do.",1311283515

That's an explanation that your brain applies to the situation, but it's not what actually happens.<p>A similar experiment is to hold a coffee mug and stand in front of a mirror.  Grasp the mug by the handle with your right hand.  Look in the mirror.  Where is the handle?  <i>It's still on your right</i>.  The coffee mug in the real world has the handle on your right, and so does the coffee mug in the reflection.  There is no left/right reversal.<p>Edit: You're not an idiot.  The mirror's behavior is simple, but it's also very non-intuitive.  If it were intuitive, people wouldn't ask the question.",1311283090

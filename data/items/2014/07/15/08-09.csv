I appreciate your civility.<p>> (Subjugation and mistreatment of blacks by whites is and was a huge problem, but it is not causing the crime problem, and it is not helping anyone to pretend that it is).<p>Centuries of subjugation and mistreatment has led to a socio-economic underclass. This is _fact_. There is plenty of documentation. Even though things are getting better the fact remains that this is the cause of the crime problem.<p>Rather than attribute the obvious source to the problem you have said:<p>1) That black on white crime is racially motivated, &quot;get whitey&quot;. You can&#x27;t just say that, you can&#x27;t just trot out unsubstantiated claims. I just don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s true.<p>2) That if only blacks got their act together in the way other races have that they&#x27;d improve their lot.<p>3) That there are poor people or underclasses in other societies and they don&#x27;t carry on the way blacks in the US do.<p>Or words to that effect.<p>For me that is not pattern matching, that _is_ prejudicial thinking. And you accuse blacks of racism! You state implicitly and explicitly that it is because of their race that the crime rates are higher and that the urban decay is worse than other places at other times. That is prejudicial thinking and we can leave morality out of it. My concern in analysing the language and the logic that you use is if you are using the same standards for every group of people. I clearly see that you are not. That means you are exhibiting bias, that your thinking is prejudicial. You&#x27;ve learnt this, you need to unlearn it. I know it&#x27;s not easy to confront that which is within us that is biased and prejudicial but there you go.<p>Tell you what. You point me towards the stats and the literature (not the anecdotes!) that have led you to these conclusions and we&#x27;ll explore this topic together.",1405414550

8035380,comment,8030314,8033689,4,0,antirez,,,"In the first post Redis + asynchronous replication + (an alpha version of) Sentinel were found to lose writes during partitions. This is an obvious result of asynchronous replication + failover, since this is, technically, an eventually consistent system where the merge function is picking a single timeline when there are divergences. Redis was improved since then by adding heuristics to practically lose less writes, but basically this was an expected result that nobody can change.<p>In the second blog post I proposed, just for an argument of a different discussion, a strongly consistent system where basically you have God coordinating the failover, and every write replicated N times. This is something that&#x27;s not even worth to test, since it is obvious that a system like that is linearizable, however it was still tested, and since it was obviously flawless per definition, the flaw was found, very surprising, in something that violates <i>any</i> CP system, that is, serving reads directly without any agreement.

That said, distributed systems are all about details, and while I&#x27;ll try hard to do my best, I can still end with something buggy.

You might be surprised to hear this, but I applaud the PDFy service and am glad someone has built it.<p>Scribd is not designed to be a simple, lightweight way to host a PDF file.  Yes, this was the original idea of Scribd 8 years ago, but we&#x27;ve long since left that path.  We see that market as having been made irrelevant by a combination of Google Docs, Dropbox/Box.net/etc., and better PDF readers now built into browsers like Chrome.  There may be room for someone to build an imgur like service for PDFs too, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re doing.<p>Scribd is really good for two things:<p>1)  Scribd is a subscription reading service (&quot;Netflix for books&quot;) where you can read over 400,000 professionally published books for $9 / month, including thousands of new releases and best-sellers.  It doesn&#x27;t include many programming books unfortunately (yet!), but if you like to read other things, it&#x27;s a good deal.<p>2)  Scribd is good for serious authors and publishers who want to publish a lot of content and organize it well.  For example, the World Bank uploads thousands of research reports to Scribd and organizes them into collections.  And many serious authors publish books and other writings with us.<p>We&#x27;re sorry that we haven&#x27;t done a good enough of explaining who we are as it&#x27;s changed over the years.  And we&#x27;re sorry if you&#x27;ve been frustrated trying to use Scribd for something it&#x27;s not particularly good at.<p>To joepie91_ - I think it&#x27;s cool that you&#x27;ve started this.  We have some experience building document hosting services, and I can see you are already encountering some issues we&#x27;ve worked on, like DMCA and copyright.

Also in Chand John&#x27;s personal case, I get the feeling from reading his essay that he&#x27;s a little bit too arrogant and that this might have turned employers away. For example:<p>&quot;Imagine you’re a brand-new Porsche in 2011. You’re sitting in a dealership, being test-driven by many enamored consumers but never purchased. Later you hear that the 2011 Toyota Camry outsold the Lexus 1.5 to 1, the Cadillac 2 to 1, and the Porsche 10 to 1. You ask yourself: Was it worth being an impressive, expensive car, if no one ever buys you?<p>That ironic situation is very real for many Ph.D.’s. I faced it myself after getting my master’s and doctorate in computer science from Stanford University, where I built software that revolutionized the study of human movement, became an early expert and core developer of software featured in Scientific American, and was one of four Ph.D.’s chosen from Stanford’s engineering school for a research award.<p>...<p>It was like being a chameleon and trying to get jobs where you had to be red, blue, or black. Yes, you’re capable of becoming any of those colors, but companies would rather hire animals that already were those specific colors. My unusual Ph.D.—in contrast to my professors’ beliefs—severely limited my career options in industry, despite my software background and my Stanford computer-science degrees (which are widely considered synonymous with wild success in Silicon Valley’s tech scene).<p>...<p>So we have today’s employment climate. At one end, companies hire whoever can get the job done, like consumers buying reliable, affordable sedans. At the other end, universities, including deeply industry-savvy ones like Stanford, pump out Ph.D.’s who, like luxury cars, are too specialized and expensive for most employers.&quot;",1405411643

One of most important features of SQLite is that it&#x27;s included in Python base libs. One very important factor is that it&#x27;s also faster than many other databases out there. What? Faster? Yes, because it runs in the process, and doesn&#x27;t require context change to proceed. So if I make 100k queries looking up information, it&#x27;s probably fastest using SQLite than other databases, which run in their own process.<p>Timing 100k reads from database: MongoDB: 43.3 s SQLite: 19.4 s<p>Same test with 4 parallel threads MongoDB: 29.9 s\nSQLite: 25.1 s<p>So as we can see, SQLite is much faster for single thread batch processing that most of other databases.

I don&#x27;t have a toy OS (not enough spare time), <i>but</i> I did work on one as part of my job.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any documents, but the way you&#x27;d generally want to do it is wrap hardware- and board-specific parts of your code in a hardware-agnostic interface which is what you use to write higher-level code in the system. That way, getting the OS to run on another CPU or board is all about writing the relevant callbacks. You can get the general idea from Linux&#x27;s mach-* and plat-* files. This isn&#x27;t really OS-specific; I&#x27;m pointing at Linux because it will probably be easiest to get documentation about it, though my personal preference is elsewhere.",1405411360

It will mean the end of a creative vibrant society if this is left unchecked - we simply cannot walk thru life as if there /may/ be a boogyman around every corner.<p>People need to be taught what reasonable risks are, and be better themselves at making good choices - moreover, we should all learn or be taught the difference between fear, and actual risk.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t the government, it&#x27;s just the canary in the mine for a far larger societal problem - the abject fear of anything and everything - in short, this never should have been reported in the first place, much less investigated.",1405411328

So its simply more efficient for the company to hire an experienced BS(CS).<p>But with a PhD, you can target jobs that the employer feels are too complex and demanding for a simple BS",1405411266

We are changing the way small business funding works.<p>We are a VC backed start-up with a small empowered development team. Engineers at Lighter Capital are true owners of their projects.

No engineering by committee.<p>To succeed at Lighter Capital you need to be not only adept at our stack (C#, MVC, Javascript, HTML) but independent and driven enough to  see your project to through to the finish without a lot of hand holding.<p>If this seems like the right fit for you, email jroper {at} lightercapital.com",1417478388

8684901,comment,8680983,8684077,0,0,lorddoig,,,"Because they keep proving it over and over again? (at least in certain problem domains they do.)<p>Government activities are generally important to a lot of people, if not because said people are direct consumers of the alleged benefits then because they paid for them.  We keep paying and they keep ballsing it up, and everything we know about the theory of government (in an economic sense) tells us this is a <i>design flaw</i> and, ergo, not something that can be expected to self-resolve.<p>And it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re totally inept all the time (although ineptitude is a recurring theme) - sometimes they do get good stuff done.  The much harder question to answer in these cases is how efficient was it?  How much tax money was shat away in admin/stupid compliance BS, and is all that wasteful pomp really a necessary price to pay for democracy?  Could there be another way?<p>It&#x27;s all very contentious, high-stakes stuff and if you disagree strongly enough with it all to wilfully not comply you&#x27;ll soon find the whole system is propped up on various threats: they&#x27;ll take your money, your home, your pride - they may even take <i>you</i>.  And they&#x27;ll do it all under a banner of moral righteousness that turns it into you vs. &quot;society&quot;.  How could that ever not be a talking point?<p>I talk about it most days in one way or another, and not because I&#x27;m some horrible right-wing fanatic who wants to wipe my ass with money and glee in the suffering of others, but because it&#x27;s an incredibly fragile, wasteful system that perpetually sits on a knife edge and I suspect does just as much harm as good.  It&#x27;s misguided in so many ways and so, <i>so</i> hard to change that all I can do is moan about it and hope that my moans contribute in some way to getting the volume of the debate loud enough to think that something <i>could</i> change.<p>So, yeah, that&#x27;s why I think it keeps coming up.",1417478219

These types of companies push forward in hope of getting acquired but this strategy isn’t sustainable. Businesses are not lottery tickets.<p>At octavius we are more interested in building sustainable businesses. We incubate ideas that can generate cash from day one, and our process of systematically approaching product development allows us to better understand risk. Once we have an accurate understanding of a market, products that have the best opportunity to succeed are spun out into their own companies to grow. The partners of octavius are founders who have bootstrapped to sustainability or sold businesses in the marketing tech space. We are currently based in a beautifully restored brick warehouse located in El Segundo’s just south of LAX.<p>#### Tech Lead Responsibilities:<p>The tech lead should think of development as a craft and see themselves as master craftsmen. They are primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of the products that we are incubating. Ideal candidates are full of ideas and are constantly looking for ways to improve themselves and the world around them. Candidates should also be able to lead a team of developers.<p>#### General Requirements:<p>* The belief that the only limitation on what is possible is ones imagination<p>* Open mind<p>* Self motivated<p>* A passion for learning<p>* The ability to “think on your feet”<p>* A willingness to solve problems with the best technology available<p>* Enjoys working on various projects<p>* Must operate effectively on a team<p>* Hustle<p>#### Specific Requirements:<p>* Clear written and oral communications skills<p>* 5+ Years experience writing production quality code<p>* Demonstrated experience working in multiple tech stacks ie Rails/Node/Ember<p>* Experience launching and managing AWS instances<p>* Experience recruiting and leading a team<p>* A CS degree or equivalent work experience<p>* SaaS experience is a plus<p>Email recruiting {at} octaviuslabs.com if interested<p>-----",1417478213

8684895,comment,8683827,8684392,0,0,saidajigumi,,,"> I wonder if some standardized tests can be, in principle, constructed to measure programming abilities.<p>This absolutely misses the point of the article.  It is definitively not about programming abilities, or speed of these abilities.<p>Many authors have hit TFA&#x27;s points from different angles.  For example, Tom Demarco&#x27;s excellent Slack[1] introduces uses of &quot;efficiency&quot; (what speed is the organization moving at?) versus &quot;effectiveness&quot; (is the organization moving in the right direction?).  DeMarco uses these to illustrate that many organizations optimize for the wrong parameters: they want to move at breakneck speed (&quot;efficiency&quot;, &quot;butts in seats&quot;, etc.), but in doing so trade off their vital strategic ability to think, design, to steer the ship!<p>In an organization without slack (briefly, the ability of knowledge workers in an organization to engage in vital reflective tasks, a key part of TFA&#x27;s design process), everyone&#x27;s so focused on Getting There that no one remains to decide if <i>There</i> is the right place to be going.  This can and does result in everything from classic technical debt to strategic business failure.  DeMarco describes a pile of organizational anti-patterns that stem from this philosophical damage.<p>I like that TFA&#x27;s author connects these concepts explicitly to more recent thinking on the importance of design process.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0932633617"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficie...</a>",1417478138

We are building a fun, no bull, buzzword-free business.<p>We make amazing AR glasses that make a 3D, holographic world that springs from your table, wall or other objects.  Unlike VR, these images are part of your world: you see them mixed in with real objects and other people so you can work or play together.  You can move around freely and look at virtual objects from all sides.  Since you look at a normal distance, we don&#x27;t have the near eye issues (distortion, nausea etc) of VR and since our glasses are open and light you can wear them and play for hours.  (You can also play VR games as well).  Our focus is not only the big &quot;AAA&quot; games -- it&#x27;s in our DNA to support social, user-generated content and make it possible for hackers to do things we can&#x27;t imagine ourselves.  We have a lot of fun things in our pipeline.<p>We make and are shipping real hardware (yes, to paying customers).

I can&#x27;t access the paper from here, but I wonder if the intelligence results in the New Scientist article are just about the shiverer mice. Here is the abstract:<p>Neonatally transplanted human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) densely engraft and myelinate the hypomyelinated shiverer mouse. We found that, in hGPC-xenografted mice, the human donor cells continue to expand throughout the forebrain, systematically replacing the host murine glia. The differentiation of the donor cells is influenced by the host environment, such that more donor cells differentiated as oligodendrocytes in the hypomyelinated shiverer brain than in myelin wild-types, in which hGPCs were more likely to remain as progenitors. Yet in each recipient, both the number and relative proportion of mouse GPCs fell as a function of time, concomitant with the mitotic expansion and spread of donor hGPCs. By a year after neonatal xenograft, the forebrain GPC populations of implanted mice were largely, and often entirely, of human origin. Thus, neonatally implanted hGPCs outcompeted and ultimately replaced the host population of mouse GPCs, ultimately generating mice with a humanized glial progenitor population. These human glial chimeric mice should permit us to define the specific contributions of glia to a broad variety of neurological disorders, using human cells in vivo.",1417476042

8684676,comment,8683827,8684284,0,0,allendoerfer,,,"It is not the fault of these tools. You can think of code as data, and programmers producing this data, just like many other professions are producing data, too. Programmers often have a variety of far better tools to handle this data. I think the reason for this are of course the programmers dogfooding, but also the culture of life-long learning, which minimizes UI design to just API design. An intuitive GUI for a crowd less open to learning new things is so much harder to make.<p>I nevertheless see this as a gift. It is your attitude with these tools, that makes you unhappy. I I often have this strange feeling of missing out on an even better technology, the cool kids might be using. I think the key here is to be confident with your choices of tools, improve them, when their is pain and identify when something is good enough for some time (measured in years) before you should reconsider again. In the end it is also about handling the tools. This sounds very reasonable but in practice it is often hard to overcome the urge to use the new shiny tool, which seems to make you a better programmer, when you define yourself as one.<p>I don&#x27;t think the extremist view of skipping them altogether and condemning the whole thing is the solution. I believe people, who feel they can&#x27;t keep up in this imaginary race either search for ways to define themselves in another way e.g. in alternative careers (like you) or in their opposing way of programming (like the article author) throwing the others in a bottle of people, who do it wrong.

8684670,comment,8683034,8684460,0,0,adwf,,,"Yeah, it&#x27;s always interesting comparing drinking laws.  In the UK we&#x27;ve tried to crackdown on underage drinking quite a bit in the past decade or two.  But it hasn&#x27;t really worked particularly well.  Part of it is that in their crackdown on drinking, they&#x27;ve massively increased the taxes on alcohol (as if price will stop people partying!).  These have really squeezed the little country pubs so much that roughly 30 pubs are closing down every week now.  You may think that this is a good thing on the surface, but all it does is drive people (and kids) from the small safe pubs in the villages, to the big venues and clubs in the towns and cities; which are open far later and push far stronger alcohol to maximise sales.  And it&#x27;s the concentration of people in the major drinking towns that leads to a lot of the disorderly behaviour, violence and accidents requiring A&E.<p>Whereas 20-30 years ago, small village pubs were a mainstay of drinking culture.  Turning a blind eye to the occasional kid drinking a pint or two was a heck of a lot safer than pushing them into the cities with fake IDs.  Or buying litres of spirits and downing them on a park bench.  But pubs can&#x27;t afford to take any risk nowadays, for each 17 year old you accidentally let into the pub, it&#x27;s a £10k fine for the manager, £5k fine for the barman who serves the kid.  Plus a possible revocation of license.<p>Then there&#x27;s the social downsides of being too strict on drinking for the rest of us. The &quot;Think 25?&quot; campaign is particularly terrible, it catches even people like me at age 30.  I can understand that maybe I look under 25, but do I really look 17 years or less - that&#x27;s what the law says they have to legally look out for after all.  <i>That is my legal right.</i>  It&#x27;s insulting and an infringement on basic liberties that we should be able to take for granted.

8684626,comment,8683827,8683827,0,0,angersock,,,"I&#x27;ll disagree with a few points here.<p>First, I think that the key is a mindset, not an age--I&#x27;m the youngest person at my company and yet I&#x27;m consistently the one pushing for smarter, smaller, better-designed solutions to our problems. It seems that a lot of people, especially those with an academic background, forget one of the three qualities of a good programmer: extreme laziness.<p>Developers (often younger ones) that manically hop from framework to framework and sprint to sprint because design work is &quot;too slow&quot; end up expending more energy than if they&#x27;d just been lazy and really <i>thought</i> about what they wanted to accomplish before they worked on it. This is especially true in business, where that mindset is invaluable for skipping work you&#x27;d otherwise do while finding fit.<p>Second, I disagree that on a good team engineers aren&#x27;t fungible: the fact is that, if you have one person who &quot;owns&quot; a part of the code, you are inviting disaster and bad design. This, and not its converse, has been proven to me over and over the last decade. Sure, one person might have the domain expertise or familiarity with something to really nail it, but they should <i>never</i> be the only one on the team who can do so.<p>If they <i>are</i>, you slip them pizzas under the door, make them happy and productive, <i>and then sack them as soon as you can extract their knowledge for they are a liability waiting to turn into a problem</i>.<p>Third, and perhaps most controversially, the author supposes that good design is important. For almost any business, sadly, it isn&#x27;t. Nobody gives a shit when you have deadlines to meet and bills to pay--and if you&#x27;re lucky, you can push that burden up onto the next poor bastard to inherit the codebase after you&#x27;ve cashed out.<p>I really, really wanted to believe that good design mattered, that somehow it had intrinsic value. Sad thing is, it doesn&#x27;t. BeOS failed. Plan9 failed. Inferno failed. Transmeta failed. Sun and SGI failed. Smalltalk failed. Lisp failed. Erlang failed (and cleverly stood back up, but not because the majority knew or cared about design).",1417475214

And either way, work would then occur to make Docker support that standard format.<p>The only real difference is that, in this approach, the ecosystem also gets a second viable runtime for these standard containers out of the deal, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad thing. You can&#x27;t have a &quot;standard&quot; that is useful in a generic sense without at least two major players pulling it in different directions; otherwise you get something like Microsoft&#x27;s OpenDocument format.",1417475166

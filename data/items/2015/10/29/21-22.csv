In addition there are 5 available &quot;spreading factors&quot; per channel that are orthogonal to each other. A lower spreading factor device may communicate at twice the data rate of the one above it (but with worse range). So for example one device may communicate at 1kbps at SF12, another may communicate at SF11 at 2kpbs at the same time. This means you can have 31 devices communicating 1kb within a 1 second window, on a single channel.<p>Other technologies can have many more simultaneously communicating devices. In the case of OnRamp/Ingenu, a factor of 1600 more due to their encoding scheme.<p>Narrowband technologies like SigFox (based on TI radios), have way more than 64 channels available in the US, I believe in the range of 1000, but are more susceptible to interference.",1446155357

10474585,comment,10473293,10474427,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"Not the OP, but one I think about a lot is converting functional, monadic code that uses first class functions/closures to equivalent imperative variants.<p>For example, manipulating collections with functions like map, flatMap, filter, etc. has become common, even in popular imperative languages like C# and Java. These calls are can be chained together to create non-strict sequences (IEnumerable, Stream, etc.) which are made strict at a later time. Each call creates a new sequence, and many take closures. Both of these require memory allocation and indirect dispatch.<p>However, in many cases it extremely straightforward to convert these into loops. For example, the following C# code:<p><pre><code>    list.Select(f).Where(p).SelectMany(g).ToList()\n</code></pre>\nCould be turned into:<p><pre><code>    var outList = new List<T>();\n    foreach(var x in list) {\n      var y = f(x);\n      if(!p(y))\n        continue;\n      foreach(var z in g(y)) {\n        outList.Add(z)\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis works, even if we known nothing about f, p, and g (e.g. they can be impure functions). This optimization is especially effective if these functions are lambdas. It is also always going to be faster and safe; the only difference is that we removed a series of extra allocations and indirect function calls. This example is admittedly simple, but many functional patterns and behaviors can be rewritten into longer imperative variants that avoid extra allocations.<p>You are right that you can have subtle changes in behavior with similar high level optimizations. For example, most functional languages make calls like these actually create a new collection at each call. If any of these functions can throw and exception or cause an effect, then we cannot perform the above rewriting because if will call the functions out of order. But if a compiler can take the time to analyze functions for external purity, these can be optimized as well.",1446155176

We can have an astronaut with a yo-yo hanging down and one with a yo-yo extending straight away while the world otherwise looks exactly the same to both of them. Both astronauts have to go through the same change in angular velocity just in opposite directions to get to the same state as the other one but one would see the yo-yo dropping down while the other one will see it rising. How does that make sense? What is so special about the one coordinate frame without centrifugal forces? With respect to what is the astronaut not rotating? Note that nothing looks unphysical here, just different but without any obvious thing that justifies the difference. And I am definitely not trying to say I am right and you are wrong, it just doesn&#x27;t look consistent to me to have centrifugal forces in an empty universe.",1446152483

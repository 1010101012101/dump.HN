You're probably blind to Google ads now, too.  (I almost never click on them.)  So... how long will it be before Google-ad blindness kicks in for the general population?",1191937829

65245,comment,65221,65221,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Good point that the way you want to present yourself on the web isn't necessarily the way you get perceived. This is kind of like the difference between procedural and event-driven programming. We design sites as collections of ""fuctions"", but most of the time people just pop in from Google for one thing -- that's how we get to introduce ourselves to the world.<p>\nI know I have a technology blog where I'm getting between 5 and 10K unique hits per month. When I designed it, I thought how people would come to the main page, read what it's all about, check out the topics and latest comments, maybe take a look at the feed What I'm finding is that Google is dumping all kinds of traffic onto my site due to searches for Salma Hayek, Pluto the Disney Cartoon, the Sweedish Bikini Team -- all kinds of extraneous stuff I added to mostly technology posts in an attempt to keep things light. I love ya, Google, and I love the traffic, but I never thought it would turn out this way.",1191936166

I think it'd make for a really interesting new genre of blogs very different from the traditional essay style. A web-based  Ajax chat style writing system and an IM client plugin as well, would make it super convenient and painless to create new posts. Traditional bloggers might occasionally do these coop posts together, others might do this type alone.<p>I had this idea because friends and I sometimes talk on IM about a topic and the chat log turns out to make quite interesting reading.",1191935489

On the stimulus side the German central banking system has always been hawkish (possibly due to their history) and this has continued to a large degree with the ECB.",1415012320

8550182,comment,8549804,8549804,0,0,cpks,,,"Dell, and the computer industry as a whole (sans Apple) has been flailing for years.<p>Lack of progress and innovation: Before Apple shipped the Retina iMac, the best laptops had the same resolution displays as the best cell phones. Typical laptops were both slower and lower resolution than phones.<p>Confusion: Buy a 4k display. Figure out what graphics card you need. DisplayPort, MiniDP, DVI, VGA, HDMI, versions of all of those, &quot;dual link,&quot; maximum graphics card resolution. It&#x27;s a disaster. Things don&#x27;t just work. I called Dell asking what would be needed for a quad monitor 4k setup with Dell monitors and computers. They didn&#x27;t know, and they didn&#x27;t know who might know. Dell has Inspiron, XPS, Alienware, Latitude, and Precision as major product lines, and most of those have 3-4 sublines. What&#x27;s the difference? Even Dell doesn&#x27;t know (hey, Dell, did you know your reputation is set as much by your business stuff as consumer stuff? People don&#x27;t differentiate). Resolution? Always labeled by weird labels like &quot;SXGA&quot; and &quot;SXGA+.&quot; If you want the actual resolution, best of luck. And don&#x27;t get me started on processor speed. What does i7-3500 even mean? If the config options have an 8 core with 4MB cache and 2GHz, and a quad core with 8MB cache and 2.2GHz, and one is of a different generation, I doubt even Intel knows how the speed compares. Going for the cheapest always makes sense, given how long it would take to figure it out.<p>Lack of choice (or nice products in general): The lines are close enough to each other that the computer you need is almost never there. The old Inspiron 8000/8100/8200, and corresponding Latitudes had interchangeable parts. You could configure to order. Today, want that high res display and a trackpoint? Can&#x27;t get it. Or want that in matte (not glossy?). Tough. Want to drive multiple high-res monitors from a laptop? Boohoo. Don&#x27;t like wide screen? Well, we don&#x27;t like you. None of those options, individually, are big sellers, but the lack of <i>any</i> of them demolished the high-end computer market.<p>Consumer-unfriendliness: It&#x27;s 2014. Why do I need to lug my power adapter with me? Couldn&#x27;t we get a standard that worked with Dell, HP, IBM, and everyone else, and when I go to a conference, hotel, or family, I just plug into their adapter? Of course not. It would hurt power adapter sales. How about standard batteries where it makes sense? Even if I upgrade a Dell to a newer Dell, my batteries all go obsolete.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder PC sales are dying. This stuff isn&#x27;t rocket science, but the organizations making PCs are f-ed up enough internally they can&#x27;t even get any of the basics right.",1415011705

Everyone has their own opinions about what the main engine is and it&#x27;s hard to get anywhere.<p>Here&#x27;s my own perspective, it has nothing to do with any city in particular.<p>(A) Housing is not a free market. Supply and demand exist, but that is not enough to make a market free. It&#x27;s never a free market because decisions are (necessarily or not) always made at the political level. This covers things from planning, interest rate policies, bankruptcy laws tenancy laws, and even things like bank bailouts. Housing is unavoidably political.<p>(B) There is a conflict of interests between home owners and renters. One wants high prices, low availability, the other wants low prices.<p>(C) There are lots of interests that fall on the rising prices side. Rising prices make it easier to make money on loans, building, etc. They make it easier to raise tax revenue that funds public services that all sorts of parties have an interest in.<p>(D) Owner-occupiers should be neutral. They own one house, regardless of market price. But because of financing, and a lot of incorrect but persistent psychology about personal wealth they usually feel firmly on the high prices side. No one wants their house to lose value.<p>(E) Nominal increase in property value is inflation. Inflation has real impact on the &quot;real&quot; economy (as economists use the term). This has to do with the value of outstanding loans and annuities.<p>We are looking at problems that are mostly political and cultural as if they are economic. Ultimately a lot of the things that drive demand for houses are the same as the things that drive demand for universities. Demand for elite universities is not about competing for education as a scarce resource. Same with housing. It&#x27;s not about competition and scarcity .

The worse case scenario is that after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, the project is delayed by any one of dozens of parties that can block development for years.<p>In summary, of the 1/10th of the required housing we do build, it is quite literally __impossible__ for any of it to be affordable and turn a profit.

To demonstrate this, let&#x27;s looks at some alternative models such as those in Russia and the Chinese domestic markets, and contrats those with the west.<p>The Chinese and Russian ssytems are very corporatist. In both cases huge corporations completely dominate the domestic economy. In Russia&#x27;s case these are technically privately held, but the oligrachs are so closely tied to the political ruling elite that this realy is just a technicality. In China the major corporations are owned by the government and explicity run by government place-men. In both cases these corporations enjoy economic, financial and political patronage and privillege that makes it functionally impossible fror &#x27;independent&#x27; corporations, companies or individuals to effectively compete with them.<p>You might argue we have a similar ssytem in the west, but we realy don&#x27;t. es there are instances of political patronage. Yes there are cases of undue political influence by corporations through lobbying.

In fact it is illegal NOT to run always be running a business in a live/work unit[2].<p>Most live/work building&#x27;s rules will require that you maintain a business license.

That said, it looks like Stockton is a bit farther from SF than your post would indicate... And I&#x27;m only guessing that a commute in and out of SF daily would be about 3-4 hours of time (just from what I&#x27;d seen going to/from the airport into the SOMA area)...  I may be mistaken here.<p>I&#x27;ve spent enough of my life commuting.. I do best with about a half hour commute, which gives me warm up/down time for my day...  I really don&#x27;t want to have a 12-13hour day from when I leave home, and get back.<p>All of that said, I don&#x27;t get why there is such a focus on bringing people into the Bay area... It would likely be easier and cost less to relocate the Yahoo guys and build-up further in, or hell, Atlanta or Phoenix.  The company could spend the savings on building up the community they move into, probably get great tax incentives, and the employees would bank a lot of cash on the relocation.  New hires would come in to more closely match the local economy even.<p>Phoenix, for example, has pretty decent internet... an okay cultural scene, some great food (okay, not as good with seafood), and already has some very large companies doing software development here (American Express, Paypal, Wells Fargo, Go Daddy...) with a lower cost of living.  Yes, summers can seem like hell on earth, but there are lots of places within an hour or so that aren&#x27;t.<p>Okay... done ranting...",1415009217

8550084,comment,8549348,8549763,0,0,pilif,,,"<i>>The behaviour Apache is using is clearly a bug.</i><p>not so sure. RFC2616 in section 3.1 says:<p><i>The HTTP version of an application is the highest HTTP version for which the application is at least conditionally compliant.</i><p>So you request HTTP/2, but the server responds in HTTP/1.1 because that&#x27;s what it understands and tells you so. The server is free to not accept your HTTP/2.0 request, but it&#x27;s also free to go ahead and respond in HTTP/1.1.<p>The RFC does not mandate a server to not accept requests in versions it doesn&#x27;t understand. The only thing the RFC says is that you&#x27;re not allowed to state that your request or response is in a protocol you don&#x27;t in-fact understand.<p>In-fact, I would argue that, considering<p><i>Applications that are at least conditionally compliant with this specification SHOULD use an HTTP-Version of &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; in their messages, and MUST do so for any message that is  not compatible with HTTP/1.0</i><p>Stating HTTP/1.1 is the only valid thing to do according to the RFC. I know that was likely not the intention, but I would certainly read the RFC that way.<p>Also see section 2.3 in RFC 2145:<p><i>An HTTP server SHOULD send a response version equal to the highest version for which the server is at least conditionally compliant, and whose major version is less than or equal to the one received in the request.  An HTTP server MUST NOT send a version for which it is not at least conditionally compliant.  A server MAY send a 505 (HTTP   Version Not Supported) response if cannot send a response using the major version used in the client&#x27;s request.</i><p>So, again, Apache MAY send a 505 but it&#x27;s totally allowed to know nothing about HTTP/2.0 yet, parse the request as HTTP/1.x and then respond with a HTTP/1.1 response.",1415009183

It was all meant to cover the fallout from the late &#x27;80s / early &#x27;90s asset bubble exploding.<p>Debt servicing costs are roughly 23 trillion yen, compared to tax revenue of 45 to 47 trillion yen for 2014. So half their budget is now just going to paying interest on debt. That&#x27;s a fiscal death spiral. Things are about to get a lot worse in Japan.<p>It&#x27;s already so bad they&#x27;ve taken to destroying the Yen to buy a very short amount of time, which is accelerating the overall erosion and rapidly dropping the standard of living. All of their projections for recovery have fallen flat (the failed Abenomics), as anybody with a basic understanding of non-Keynesian economics would have known ahead of time.<p>Want to know what comes next? A more dramatic debasement of the Yen, as a means to stave off default a bit longer. It won&#x27;t work, their debt situation will get worse, and the cost to service that debt will climb, sapping even more of their tax revenues; confidence in the Yen will fall, and their ability to prop up the debt situation by debasing the Yen will begin to weaken; sooner than later, they will no longer be able to maintain the facade.",1415009070

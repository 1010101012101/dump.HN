I hope I can help the understanding via this comment.<p>Pretty much all <i>poetry</i> for example is full of misunderstandings, obfuscated, with clever literally devices and it is intentionally so. Consider poetry then! Think about why many people value poetry over a clear concise newspaper article. Why do humans like art, why do people like these confusing things? Do they actually enjoy the confusion, or is it something else that they enjoy?<p>Your example is Jane Austin vs 50 shades of grey. Perhaps other comparisons would help. How about Dan Brown vs Shakespeare?  How about Beethoven vs Bananarama?  How about Turner vs Bob Ross?  Do these comparisons help in understanding what defines a quality piece of work? Do you think that a university that for two years examines Dan Brown in it&#x27;s literature department will continue doing so when Dan Brown no longer becomes popular and Game of Thrones becomes popular? What does that say about the educational and artistic value of an author when they are forgotten a few years later?<p>Should the subjects of universities be decided by the consumers, the young students? Or should they be decided by the academic establishment? What difference would that make to education, to critical thinking? This is some of what the article was about.",1429872903

9432403,comment,9431394,9431394,0,0,netcan,,,"I had a really interesting conversation with a couple of guys a few months ago about cost of living. Cost of living is a really interesting entry point into thinking about economics, policies, wealth and such. I really think our decisions would be better if this was a bigger part of the economic debate rather then the very abstract macroeconomics, political theory and abstract ideological debates we have been carrying for so long. The role of technology, policy and taste/choices is a lot easier to decipher. I think it&#x27;s a lot more productive way of structuring public debate/demands/protests.<p>Cost of living at the fat centre of the distribution for many/most households in advanced economies looks something like like this:<p><pre><code>  - Housing + utilities (25-50% of income)
  - Transport (10-20%)
  - Groceries (7.5-15%)
</code></pre>
Housing is the big hairy item. It&#x27;s dishearteningly competitive, so high income places often have correspondingly high housing costs and the percentage remains constant.<p>Anyway.. Transport.<p>Transport is a major cost item and it&#x27;s quality is important. A fundamental ingredient in most people and place&#x27;s fundamental economic wellbeing equation. It&#x27;s also one of the most fixable with technology.<p>A 90 minutes commute on crowded public transport is way worse than a 10 minute walk or drive. Transport infrastructure takes up a lot of space, affects air quality, makes noise, affects walkability and lots of other key quality of life issues. Energy. Time. Health. Money. Transport is a very big deal.<p>If you&#x27;ve seen cities that had major increases in cycling and/or electric bikes/scooters, you were probably surprised by the success. There is a lot of potential here.<p>10-20 mph electric bikes, given the right customs, rules and infrastructure can be awesome in dense urban areas. Potentially game-changing over time.",1429872247

    blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages

9432296,comment,9431394,9432196,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Nah, scooter is a wide ranging term. More specifically we have snorscooters, bromscooters, and motorscooters. The motorscooter (actual term that exists, though not popular) is just a regular motorcycle.<p>The snorscooter is limited to 25 km/h, but is manufactured generally at 30, up to 45 km/h with artificial limitations on the engine which can be turned off. (guess what happens). And these are allowed on bicycle paths.<p>Only the bromscooter and motorscooter, must go on the road.<p>So yeah cyclists do end up sharing their lanes with vehicles going up to 45, while a bike in the city usually goes around 15. Particularly annoying is cycling with a friend, and having to cycle in front of each other instead of side by side every 30 seconds because something twice as fast wants to pass you by.<p>I quite like the electric scooters in general as a consumer, a friend of mine has one and I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and it&#x27;s great. But generally I&#x27;m not a fan of the concept. We&#x27;ve come a very long way here with cycling, spending 20 minutes going to your work, 20 minutes back, 10 to the grocery store and 10 to a cafe in the evening, that&#x27;s pretty much the daily required exercise you want every human being to have. It&#x27;s plays a huge, mostly unintentional, part in our health. It&#x27;s very safe, as we have lightweight, nimble, 15 km/h vehicles on dedicated lanes. And it gives rise to a different form of city planning, one where life is designed around a 30 minute cycling distance radius, as opposed to what I experienced in the US (living & work & entertainment are hugely separated. You have to do groceries by car, and go to work by car.) And lastly, of course, the environmental factors of not just running motorised vehicles (whether electric or fossil fuels), but also the manufacturing of them.<p>So while I&#x27;d love to see motors go electric, particularly cars, I&#x27;m at the same time concerned that the scooter versus the bicycle will become more popular! :)",1429870396

9432291,comment,9431944,9431944,0,0,QuantumRoar,,,"Scripting languages try to seduce you to just fiddle around until the output looks like something you want. While that quickly gives you some results, I think it&#x27;s a huge roadblock in the mid- to longterm. Especially when programmers are only familiar with &quot;easy&quot; scripting languages, there are rarely insights about the general approach to the problem until the project already grew to become an abomination.<p>While fiddling around is still somewhat possible in Haskell, the language itself makes it quite difficult. Haskell kind of forces you right at the beginning to pause and think &quot;Well, what is it that I&#x27;m actually trying to do here?&quot; It let&#x27;s you recognize and apply common patterns and implement them in abstract ways without having to think about what kind of values you actually have at runtime. In that way Haskell is the most powerful language I know.<p>Have a tree/list/whatever? Need to apply a function to each of the elements? Make your tree/list/whatever an instance of the Functor type class and you&#x27;re done. Need to accumulate a result from all the elements? Make it foldable.<p>Something depends on some state? Make it a Monad.<p>You either get a result or you don&#x27;t (in which case any further computations shouldn&#x27;t apply)? Use the Maybe Monad.<p>You need to compute different possible results? Use the List Monad.<p>Need to distinguish three different possible values that are different compositions of elementary types? Make yourself your own type and pattern match the behavior of applying functions.<p>Need to output in a certain way? Make it an instance of the Show class.<p>Most concepts that are used every day have some kind of idea behind them that is abstract and implementation independent. Haskell kind of forces you to reference those ideas directly. The downside is that you actually have to know about those concepts. However, knowing about the such concepts makes you also a better programmer in other languages, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a bad thing.",1429870295

As part of their arrangement with the city, Verizon has to pass a bunch of neighborhoods in NYC that will have very low FiOS uptake.[1] They have to recoup the cost of that from somewhere, and charging high prices for premium tiers is how they do it.

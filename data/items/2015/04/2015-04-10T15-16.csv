Do you use it for mobile development, what&#x27;s your usual environment?<p>I am using a late 2008 Macbook (Unibody Macbook 5.1) for the same sort of activities you use it and find it fine and that is worrying me a bit, I use it about 6 hours a day for my personal projects and entertainment. It originally came with 2GB RAM which I upgraded about 5 years ago to 4GB, then a couple of years ago I upgraded it to 8GB, which is the maximum it takes. I also replaced the 160 GB HDD hard drive with a 256 SSD, I replaced the battery once, and had to change the power adapter too. I&#x27;ve also upgraded the OS from Leopard > Snow Leopard > Lion > Mountain Lion > Mavericks > Yosemite. To be clear it&#x27;s an original &#x27;Macbook&#x27; which was phased out as a brand and recently (today actually) been reintroduced as the new &#x27;Macbook&#x27;. The processor is an ancient Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz but somehow I can keep managing to working on my Node.js, Xcode 6/Swift projects alright.<p>I believe your Macbook Air is not upgradeable in the same way as my Macbook so this is perhaps the reason you are finding you need more performance. I&#x27;m not trying to suggest you don&#x27;t need a new machine by the way, I am genuinely interested where you find performance becomes an issue because even though I am happy with my laptop some of my friends can&#x27;t believe I am using this laptop as my primary (and only) machine so I do feel a bit insane sometimes. I once thought it may be that I&#x27;ve just gotten used to the slowness and don&#x27;t notice it but I do use a high end desktop at my day job for C++/C# dev work on Visual Studio, and used the latest laptops at the Apple Store but only for browsing so it is hard for me to compare dev work.<p>I really hope I&#x27;m not spending twice as long as everyone else compiling or doing other processor heavy tasks and just got used to it, that would be pretty stupid. Even the new Macbook 2015 which has what is considered a weak processor by the press has better benchmark scores than the processor in mine. Perhaps I&#x27;ll go from my old Macbook to the new Macbook.",1428681577

9355159,comment,9353998,9353998,0,0,startupfounder,,,"Increasing physical health significantly increases mental health in my experience.<p>Biking + Water = joy!<p>Fitness: Ride a bike! See the world! As you are already indoors most of the day staring at your computer screen (as I am) I highly recommend taking up an &quot;out-the-front-door&quot; outdoor physical activity that you can do for the rest of your life.<p>Biking is low impact on your body and you can get an incredible amount of fitness in a very little amount of time while taking in fresh air and sunshine. I have burned over 1,000 calories in one hour and over 10,000 calories in a day while traveling over 150 miles on a bike. It doesn&#x27;t get easier, you just get faster.<p>As a side note: fat leaves the body through CO2 on your outbreath! WOW mind blown!<p>Fuel: WATER!!!  Drink water & eat real whole foods. You should always have clear urine so drink water first thing in the AM and all day long, drink enough to take a piss break every hour to get you up and out of your work chair. This alone will make you feel 10x better.<p>Healthy fueling happens in the grocery store. Shop the edges of the store (not the aisles) and buy things that contain lots of water and are a single ingredient: vegetables, fruits, bananas, apples, carrots, dates, watermelon, etc. not items that are processed. I have a sweet tooth and after eating fresh bananas and dates I don&#x27;t even touch/want the ice cream in the freezer. I swear, dates are the most amazing food on earth! Take them on your bike rides instead of processed bars. Eat as much fresh raw food as you want, your body processes it quickly and you won&#x27;t feel bogged down like when you are digesting meat.",1428681540

While I do like the radio-style format in many cases (as opposed to the on-demand format of services like Spotify) I still tend to prefer human-programmed streaming &quot;stations&quot; over algorithmic ones.  Picking a style and having it play a variety of music is great but as a long-time fan of several Shoutcast stations, there is simply nothing like a playlist being designed by someone with a love and knowledge of music.<p>One of my great joys in life is to listen to a station with great choices and great variety and realize some thematic connection between the last few songs the DJ picked.

Walking is a basic human movement pattern and is one of the first things we learn how to do early in our lives.<p>My grandfather passed away at 94 two years ago from old age. He never went to the gym, never participated in long marathons and he was a <i>frequent</i> beer drinker. But he did long walks everyday on the farm in the morning and evenings, he also ate well and by 10pm he was in bed.<p>Morale of the story is that, go back to the basics and stick to them. You won&#x27;t go wrong.<p>Edit: Added a reference.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/april/walking-vs-sitting-042414.html?hn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/april/walking-vs-sitting-...</a>",1428681149

You seem to think that HTTP should remain the &quot;default&quot; and that HTTPS should only be used where expressly justified.<p>If there are legitimate technical reasons to use HTTP then use HTTP. However HTTPS should be on most sites or services unless you have a specific technical, legal, or otherwise reason not to do so.<p>Keep in mind that every HTTP site you visit at Starbucks can be MITM-ed. So if you&#x27;re visiting a HTTP site and then hitting a &quot;login&quot; or &quot;contact&quot; button which redirects you to HTTPS one then for all intents and purposes the entire site is now not MITM protected since an attacker can change that link to point to an insecure domain they control. HSTS won&#x27;t even protect you from this if you&#x27;re using sub-domains (since the attacker controls the link itself, so can link to another site they control).<p>Another popular example is: What if someone sitting in Starbucks is looking up AIDs information or something else potentially damaging to their reputation? If all of the federal government&#x27;s web-sites are HTTPS by default then that little AIDs informational site is likely HTTPS also, however if HTTPS has to be justified using some kind of threat model, then more than likely it won&#x27;t be HTTPS as it doesn&#x27;t contain the kind of content people typically protect (just static HTML pages and images).<p>So in the threat model are you going to examine the possibility of reputation damage and complex phishing scams (e.g. replacing a government department&#x27;s phone number)? And if you do look at it at that level are any sites really going to be able to justify not being HTTPS?",1428680775

It&#x27;s making me not want to commit. I treat a commit as an extended save operation, so unconsciously avoiding saving is definitely not something you want to do. I know most people would object to my use of a commit as an extended save, but I stand by that opinion as well, especially in these days of deploy-by-commit systems like Heroku. Sometimes I make commits that are smaller than a commit message would be so having to write a message will be a big waste.<p>Also, commit messages are a form of documentation; but they are one of the least useful ones. Much less useful in my opinion than docstrings, topical guides, references and blog posts.

Of course, I am already seeing results after 4 weeks of doing this.<p>2. This was unexpected, but I started using Rise.us and got a great registered dietician.

At first I didn&#x27;t really get it, but now, I&#x27;m doing the same thing. It&#x27;s really good for me having someone who can help me make better decisions about what I&#x27;m eating. Lots of veggies, moderate portions of meat, little fats. It&#x27;s working well for me.<p>3. Cut out booze. Having young kids and non-stop days with something always going on; it&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to have a few glassed of wine a night. Now I&#x27;ll maybe have two glasses a week.

My buddies in the dealership domain are my customers. They call me up and ask me for a feature directly.<p>From my experience, this yields better quality features than talking to the domain expert that's probably trying to translate <i>his</i> conversation with the customer.<p>2. There's the advantage of you being in a domain where most people are your friends <i>then</i> your potential users. A lot of psychological walls are broken this way (what is he trying to sell me?). We trust each other by our reputation in the industry and this tends to extend to they quality of software they expect from us. Them knowing that we're developing it ourselves helps a lot.<p>Imagine cold walking into a business like a salesman would and offering your product. Now imagine walking into the business where you know the owner very well and you intend of having coffee with him first, then telling him about how you might be able to help him out. Big difference.<p>There are more, but these come to mind now.<p>So it's not only quality of software, but also how much easier it is to get your first paid user base that will enable you to create a good product that would hopefully scale beyond your paid-users-as-friends.",1267477191

1159742,comment,1159545,1159596,0,0,jmackinn,,,"Unused Gift Cards is a real thing, although not so much a problem.  At one of the places I work, we are about to introduce gift cards, and from a business standpoint they are awesome.<p>Anyone who has a business that could use gift cards should offer them.  On average, gift cards will leave anywhere from 10% to 30% of the original total unused (depending on products the card can purchase and the total cost of the card).<p>These companies that are trying to solve the 'problem' (they are definitely not a problem if you are the one selling them) of unused gift cards may run into problems of their own.  Read the back of most gift cards and you find that just like concert tickets, they are non-transferable, non salable, and have no cash value.  While it would be incredible difficult to prove a certain gift card was transfered or sold, upset card sellers may be able to go after the companies facilitating the selling (pure speculation).<p>Personally, I don't think that unused card trading companies will take away much of the profitability of gift cards, but it also may make consumers feel more comfortable buying gift cards.<p>Either way, unused gift cards are very real, and if you can, you should look into selling them.",1267476975
1159741,comment,1159435,1159646,0,0,pyre,,,"As far as I know Toronto's real estate market hasn't taken much of a hit at all during the past couple of years. I think there is growing sentiment that this is a delayed bubble waiting to burst though.<p>I have no data to back this up, and I'm hearing it from family/acquaintances that aren't really in real estate or economics, so take it with a grain of salt. I'm also on the other side of the continent and living in the US, so I'm a little out of touch with conditions there other than what I gather get second-hand from others.<p>As to the article itself, it doesn't really mention that some markets (like in Alberta) suffered real estate slumps, though from the data it looks like a lot of those people did not become insolvent, even though their house value dropped.<p>It's interesting to note how different the markets can be in Canada though. When oil prices skyrocketed, BC and Alberta were doing really well for themselves due to the oil sands. On the other hand, Ontario was slowing down because most of the economy is predicated on manufacturing (Ford, GM, and others have plants in Ontario; Oakville, Windsor, Oshawa, etc), exports to the US, and drawing in Hollywood with incentives to film in Toronto (though I think that they are province-wide, and not local incentives). This was mainly due to the rise of the USD-CAD conversion rate though that was coupled with the rise in oil speculation.<p>It'll be interesting to see how some of these things play out in the future. From listening to CBC radio during that period, I gleaned that Canada at one point was a mostly resource-based economy, but that in more recent years (for varying definitions of 'recent'), things have changed to become more dependent on the US investing money due to the benefitial USD-CAD rates. What happens if the US hits a larger slump? How will this affect Canada? Will the aggregate affect be minimal due to the rise and fall of different sections of the country negating each other?",1267476959

Most people opt out.  In that, it's exactly like every other ""free"" system - anyone who can afford to go outside the ""free"" system does.<p>Given that, why would you want to expand the scope of free?<p>> I'm not sure why you're picking out ""Efficiency"" in a health care system, and deliberately ignoring ""Effective and valuable"". While efficiency is commendable, you're missing the point of a health care system somewhat...<p>It's almost impossible to be effective without being somewhat efficient.  We don't have infinite resources to spend on medical care and expanding public won't change that.  What it will change is reduce efficiency, which leads to more total spending and/or less medical care.  (It's likely to be both.)<p>Which reminds me - ""public option"" advocates don't want to talk too much about ""effective and valuable"" as some of their key research support is based on lower cost per death, not cost per life.  Unless, of course, the goal is effective deaths.",1267476788

Few vendors really care about Linux. On the other hand, Windows has it really easy. Before the release of a new version, vendors work their asses off with Microsoft to ensure that before the OS reaches market, their drivers are already up to date. Apple has to care about only one piece of hardware which is manufactured by them (leaving peripherals of course).

1159682,comment,1159438,1159438,0,0,ryanhuff,,,"I have fallen into the trap of trying to come up with an idea that is completely unique.  Its tempting to look for new categories to attack, while dismissing categories with entrenched players as the lack of competition looks so appealing.  In reality, unless you have some highly unique attribute to bring to market, trying to create the new market can be highly problematic.  If it hasn't already been done, are your potential customers even looking for a solution to a pain?  Also, are you certain that if you found a new market, that the lack of competitors isn't a sign that there really isn't a market?<p>Even though existing markets are full of competitors, the opportunities in existing areas are much more plentiful.  Instead of looking for the next big thing, why not focus for a niche in an existing market, and grow it from there? The competitive landscape is constantly changing, and new opportunities are always being created as the market shifts like the tides.  What it often takes is just a new twist on an existing concept.  If you attack an existing market, all you really need is an opening through a target niche to gain a foothold, and from there, iterate as fast as you can.",1267475607

(Plus some MySQL performance tweaks, which I won't go into here)<p>Some advantages:<p>* When it comes to redundancy and failover, you can re-use the existing master/slave replication functionality in MySQL, rather than worry about whether your k/v store of choice supports anything like this, how stable it is and how to configure and manage it etc. One less thing to worry about especially if you're already doing mysql replication for other data.<p>* MySQL can keep hot data in RAM and cold data on disk, and is pretty tuneable in this regard; some of the trendy k/v stores aren't so hot on this front (eg Redis, although they're addressing it in version 2)<p>* With InnoDB tables (which are pretty good for k/v functionality) you get the transaction support which can save your ass from some nasty race conditions with concurrent processes writing back to a cache. Especially handy if your main relational dataset is also in MySQL since you can update the normalised data and the cached data in one transaction<p>* You can join 'relational-style' tables directly to the 'k/v-style' tables, rather than having to fetch a bunch of IDs and then look them up (for some stores, one at a time) in a separate store. Which is a great when you have some infrequently-changed data that can be denormalised as cached blobs, and some frequently-changing data which refers to it.<p>* Possibly more...",1267474257

1. How did you come up with this as a topic for an eBook?<p>2. Is this your area of expertise, or did you see a niche market?<p>3. What are some specifics on your AdWords campaign?<p>4. Looks like you have a strong online presence. Do you think that helped sell your book or was it completely irrelevant to its success?",1267473746

The author spends most of his time associating government spending with negative impacts on well-being.<p>This essay advances a vague, unmeasurable quantity as being of paramount importance, disguises the intent of the essay with a few apolitical examples, then proceeds to argue that a number of recent government initiatives are obviously ill-conceived, in light of their impact on this unmeasurable quantity.  As a whole, the essay is little more than an attack on government, framed as an objective discussion of economic methodology.",1267473654

Invoicing and time tracking fall under category #1 along with project management and bug tracking as one of those things that naturally come to mind when thinking about a startup to work on.<p>In my case, I'm glad I started Ronin, despite the level of competition out there. I really felt (and still do feel) that I had something unique to bring to it. In my case, it was a certain workflow that I had experience with coupled with strong UX/UI experience. And, I felt the current players in the market were insufficent (for my tastes).<p>The real key here is to realize that in such a field, there is a large noise to signal ratio. Unless you can rise above that, it will just be 1 major player getting the lion's share of the users and the rest tripping over each other. (In my field, for example, Freshbooks is still the major player.)<p>On the other hand, if you succeed to the point where you are a level above the noise, you have a built in insolation layer that discourages overly simplistic and naive attempts at entering the market.<p>If you think you can commit to bringing a noticeable, appreciable and sufficient difference in quality, there's no fear in wading into a well-established field. Almost everyday I get emails from users that have noticed the difference in quality that we provide. However, if you're just there to throw up a half-assed attempt or to be a player with no discernible quality differences, I'd seriously reconsider.",1267473623

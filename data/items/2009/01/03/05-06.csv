I recommend you get some sort of a network byte counter, then go to a few sites that feel similar in size/scope to what you plan. Use their ""bytes per visit"" as a ballpark figure.<p>For instance, I'm using Safari and turned on the ""Show Network Timeline"" then reloaded hacker news. 34kB. Then I went to slashdot.org: 643KB for a first visit, probably more like 74KB for subsequent front-page load (scripts are the bulk but they cache).<p>If you use a VPS solution, you will be managing your machine which is nice, but if you aren't already skilled at that it will be a distraction from your webapplication that you might be better without.<p>The big question with VPS solutions is ""how fast is my machine today?"" I have a tiny slice at VPSlink that used to be nicely snappy, but now is painfully slow. Something outside my visibility has changed on my server and there is nothing I can do. My slightly cheaper server at RapidXen is much faster.<p>Slicehost guarantees CPU share based on your slice size, but I don't see the denominator, I assume since a nearly 16GB slice is available that is the denominator which would give you 1/64th of the machine, worst case. Disk IO is another thing entirely, 1/16th of a modern CPU is ok, 1/64th of a disk drive spindle is painful. I suspect that is why my VPSlink machine has become slow.<p>Money can mitigate some of this, just buy a bigger slice. Mine are tiny because I am interested in how much I can do in a ~$7/mo server.",1230961878

The modus operandi is drastically different between the two sites.  Twitter isn't a ""feature"", it's a ""service"", a highly extensible and mobile service.  The fact that it is focused on such a simple protocol as telling people what you are doing, imo will ensure its longevity.<p>Given that people look at Facebook statuses as a mere <i>extension</i> of a user's profile, versus a Twitter timeline <i>actually serving as</i> your profile, simply distributing your Facebook status on a web page isn't going to phase Twitter one bit.<p>And I still stand by what I said earier: Facebook and Twitter users aren't the same.

418161,comment,417463,417881,0,0,niels_olson,,,"=========================<p>First, a bit of context<p>=========================<p>This article was written shortly after the spectacular collapse of Long Term Capital Management in late 1998. At the core of LTCM were Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, who shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model was inspired by some calculus developed for rockets. Rockets have to constantly recalculate their trajectories, constantly reassuming certain assumptions about the path ahead. It didn't take much to see how similar math could be very useful for trading: it's simply a matter of choosing the right space and the right projectile (eg, imagine the space of all stocks and your portfolio as the projectile).<p>The Black-Scholes model is at the core of what Mandelbrot calls ""portfolio theory"". <i>That</i> is what collapsed in late 1998, what would prompt Mandelbrot to write an article or motivate some editors to ask him to write an article. Keep in mind, the one of the claims the fractals guys make is that fractals help explain turbulence, which is very related to, again, rockets. Interestingly, from 1947 to 1949, Mandelbrot studied aeronautics at Cal Tech (which gets <i>huge</i> USG and DoD money for aeronautics). Shortly after returning to France, his focus appears to have sharpened on what would become the seeds of his fractal theory. He started publishing papers in applied fields, like fluid dynamics and economics. So, just based on history, without thinking about the content of the theories themselves, I think it's reasonable to assume that Mandelbrot would have some professional interest and awareness of the Black-Scholes model.<p>Now, considering that the Black-Scholes model is quite competitive with fractal theory in the big-money arenas of fluid dynamics and economics, and considering the bells of Stockholm have not yet tolled for Mandelbrot, it is little wonder he would be keenly interested in discussing the merits of his theory in the context of the competing theory's recent and spectacular failure.<p>Scholes et al claimed to provide predictive power with their model at work in LTCM's computers. It is worth noting, in the current recession, the Black-Scholes model remains at the heart of the false confidence all those ""Quants"" on Wall Street gave their bosses, which is what led to their bosses feeling comfortable with 30:1 leverage positions.<p>I couldn't agree more with Anon84, except to extend the analogy further: no mathematics can explain the markets in a predictive way such that people don't loose money. If that were the case, everyone would make money and then you'd have, oh, wait, a bubble. Here's a direct analogy:<p>Black-Sholes trading : Russian Financal Crisis of 1998<p>Rocket on infinite trajectory : Giant black obelisk appearing in the flight path right in front of the rocket<p>There are things that can be done in markets that are not possible in the space-time continuum.<p>Buyer be warry.<p>--------------<p>Quant, btw, is a pun. It's quantitative economics, sure, but it's also ""Quantum"", because it has been, since I was an undergrad in the '90s, the easiest place for a physics grad to get a job. To see how tight the relationship is, Google for quant and search the first article you find for ""Black-Scholes"". The two are inextricable.<p>===========================================<p>Second: portfolios target 95%<p>and neglect the 5% that makes us<p>human<p>===========================================<p>You see, the markets aren't the space-time continuum. They are full of nasty discontinuities, legal, psychological, and otherwise. Thus hedge funds are always looking for 'smart people motivated by curiosity', which translates roughly to ""We find these damn discontinuities in our trades, and we need someone who can just focus on the math and not worry about how much the fund is leveraged and whether or not our seed money came from Russian mafiosos and how much return we promised to the sovereign wealth fund of  Ethiopia (if you'd rather keep race out of the argument, please replace Ethiopia with Iceland)""<p>And that over-the-top quote points out the issue: the mathematical <i>descriptive</i> theories make assumptions, but the real world contains the <i>entire</i>, <i>real</i> space and the <i>real</i> consequences, and <i>real</i> people and the <i>real</i> environment will bear those consequences. If you wipe out Ethiopia's national wealth, then they have no money until they dig up some more gold. Little babies die, fathers abandon their families looking for work, homes are lost. But, hey, at least the price of gas went down. Good thing America has so well insulated itself from the consequences of its actions.",1230960823

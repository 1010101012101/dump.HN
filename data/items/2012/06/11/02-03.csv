The Google+ layout is much better than it used to be, but it needs a real two-fragment layout on large screens, which it still does not have. Why have a layout that is half-hidden on the right, especially on large screens when two fragments could easily be placed side by side?<p>Is is possible, even easy, to do a single code-base that ""auto-magically"" adapts to one Fragment object visible, or two, depending on the platform's choice of layout.",1339383565

4093016,comment,4091569,4092935,2,0,david_shaw,,,"I think the reasoning behind this is that credit card numbers have a very low life expectancy after they are leaked. One or two fraudulent charges, and the CC# is generally cancelled.<p>Medical records, however, usually include full personal details (address history, medical history, SSN, phone numbers, etc.) and by definition can't be changed. Therefore, should someone access this data, there is a whole range of fraud and identity theft that can be executed. Most people don't have credit monitoring services, and it's way easier to <i>take out</i> a fraudulent credit card and rack up charges that will never be detected (until some of the bills go through or the credit card defaults) than it is to use a legitimate one.<p>So, it's not the medical data <i>per se</i>, except maybe blackmail or insurance fraud (not common), but more generic identity theft.

4092980,comment,4092629,4092629,5,0,tferris,,,"The ongoing discussion about outsourcing on HN is getting slightly tedious. Outsourcing is like a good api and makes sense ...<p>- if it abstracts things away from you<p>- if is much cheaper and yield better results than if doing it yourself<p>- if the communication, specification and resource management overhead is in a healthy relation to the actual work<p>- and most important: if you stay independent<p>So, some good examples which make sense to outsource: tax, simple content work like writing and all areas which are not related to your core competencies. The problem with outsourcing IT and dev stuff is that even if you are yourself a developer that you still quickly get dependent on the contractor and over time your influence on this contractor will vanish away until the contractors dictates timeline, priorities, features for slowly raising day rates. Changing the contractor leads to new costs for training or for a total rewrite. Thus, if you want to outsource development, outsource those parts which do not belong to the core of your product or which can be isolated from the rest with a clean API and no dependencies to other modules.<p>I believe that most development stuff should be done by the founders themselves. Not because they enjoy coding, no the reason is simple: A founder or business owner basically build a business systems consisting of business processes. Business processes and a business system are the premises for a scalable business. And we are doing tech business anyway, so our code is nothing else than efficient representations of our business. Our code reflects our business processes. Thus, I wouldn't like to let third parties decide on the core of my business. I'd code even a simple website for my product myself because it's easy and it's reflects all the Marketing processes of my company and I want to control them myself.",1339382508

The report is lengthy, as it addresses many questions, but the core argument for the craziness in China's real estate market is that it is the most common form of (long-term) investment in China, and the government is the biggest beneficiary of it.<p>Basically, if you look at an asset breakdown of personal wealth, real estate will account for 65% of all investments in China, while in other countries like the US or in the EU, that number is close to 20% (source: World Bank & Citibank's Investment Research and Analysis). Other than that, because of a reform on the tax sharing mechanism (in 1994), local governments are highly dependent on the real estate market, as 40-55% of their direct income comes from land sales and property-related taxes. That gives the government a very high incentive to keep property prices up and the real estate market booming.<p>I can email the report to anyone interested in it (sorry, can't just upload to the public here, I worked at Citibank once, could get me into trouble), just send an email to me (rafaelcamera@gmail.com) and remember to put HN on the subject.",1339381477

These paying customers could care one iota about Codd's 12 Rules, 3NF, and Chef/Puppet configuration. If you truly believe that those things are more important than <i>getting paying customers</i>, then you, my friend, have a hobby, not a business. The IMPORTANT thing is <i>""getting them to sign on the line which is dotted.""</i> Not mucking about at the CLI.<p>>To suggest that you want to concentrate on the ""business aspect"" simply means that you don't want to do the hard part. By outsourcing, the article states: ""I have more time and I can spend this time for marketing and blogging"". ... Right. Because blogging and marketing is so very tough?<p>Sigh. The common engineers fallacy of thinking that <i>creating</i> is enough. It is not. Steve Jobs was a <i>salesman</i>. And I can assure you that marketing is not as simple as throwing up a wordpress blog and a facebook page. It takes <i>real</i> work. Which I suspect you would know if you'd ever done it.<p>HN: You don't get rich by agonizing over data structures and algorithms (unless you're Google). You get rich by leveraging resources so the multiplier effect works to your advantage. If the most efficient path to getting paying customers is to outsource, then do so.

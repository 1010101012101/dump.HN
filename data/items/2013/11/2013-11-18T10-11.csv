6753718,comment,6751492,6751492,1,0,d4nt,,,"Google, and tech companies in general, should not be trying to innovate <i>despite</i> the need to make money, they should be trying to innovate <i>because of</i> the need to make money. If Google have lost that culture of innovation because of a short term need for operational efficiency then it will hurt them in the long run. People have observed how Microsoft failed to capitalise early on the internet, the smartphone explosion and the tablet explosion because of a poor culture. While that effect takes many years to hurt the bottom line, it is real and it hurts. If Google go down the same road then that is them failing at plain old capitalism, not the death of some alternative utopian dream.",1384772009
6753717,comment,6753044,6753622,1,0,teraflop,,,"Regarding #1: it&#x27;s not really coins that are mined, it&#x27;s blocks (which happen to include a reward paid to the miner). Blocks are numbered and include a hash of their parent, so you can get a tree-like structure of blocks. But only the longest branch &quot;counts&quot;, so miners have an incentive to spread information about the current highest block as quickly as possible.<p>In cases there two blocks happen to be mined simultaneously there&#x27;s a brief period of uncertainty regarding which transactions were committed and who earned the mining reward. But as blocks are generated on both branches at random intervals, eventually one will become longer and snowball from there. The key is that the average time between blocks is about 10 minutes, muck longer than the communication delay between miners.<p>As to #2: first of all, the Bitcoin protocol knows nothing about exchange rates. And secondly, in a market-based exchange, you can&#x27;t just &quot;tie&quot; a price to anything. You could set up a fixed-price exchange, but if the market price was different from the one you picked, either buyers or sellers would look elsewhere to get a better deal. (That is, unless you provided some additional benefit over the existing exchanges that was considered valuable enough to make up for the price difference.)",1384772009
6753716,comment,6753044,6753622,1,0,vertex-four,,,"> what prevents collisions from two miners mining the same bitcoin at the same time?<p>Absolutely nothing. There can, in fact, be two blocks at the same height. This is a temporary fork. What happens is that miners mine the next block on top of one or the other at random, and the chain which gets the next block &quot;wins&quot;, and everyone then mines on top of that.<p>To make it clearer, at any time, the longest chain of blocks wins. There can be two chains of the same length at any point, but that doesn&#x27;t last for long, as it&#x27;s statistically incredibly unlikely that this will continue for more than a block or so.<p>There&#x27;s a page full of times that it&#x27;s happened, here: <a href=""https://blockchain.info/orphaned-blocks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/orphaned-blocks</a>",1384772000

If it is communist, it is a great filter for people who would like to own the means of production (equity) rather than getting paid from surplus profits! (salary).

6753608,comment,6752197,6753236,2,0,bad_user,,,"Here are some ideas:<p>(1) you can import your email from any account (that supports POP3) in a new GMail account. Just go to Settings -> Accounts in your new GMail account and configure it (note that the old GMail account also has to have POP3 activated). Actually from a new GMail account you can also send email using an older email account by SMTP. So basically, with a new GMail account, you can keep using an old email account from within the same interface, if that&#x27;s what you want (heck, you could use a Fastmail.fm account from within a GMail interface, if you don&#x27;t mind the slight latency).<p>Make sure that you label these emails with a special label, such that you can filter them later more easily.<p>(2) on your old email account, you can set a &quot;Vacation Responder&quot; that informs people of your new email address automatically.<p>So yeah, if you like GMail, then don&#x27;t wait and do migrate to your own Google Apps domain. You won&#x27;t get ads anymore in GMail, you&#x27;ll have the option to migrate without losing your email address and you&#x27;ll be treated like a customer (in my experience that doesn&#x27;t necessarily match other people, their support has been very responsive).<p>And $5/month is not very cheap, but on the other hand it&#x27;s the price for 1-2 coffees and I value my email. I do prefer the &quot;Flexible&quot; plan and not the &quot;Annual&quot; plan, because the later imposes a termination tax. So do it, don&#x27;t wait.",1384769798

And you need to pay at peak for whatever your peak is and deal with additional complexity of elastic scaling to begin with.  No doubt you&#x27;re paying smart people already to figure this out - it doesn&#x27;t come for free.<p>In any account - if you take a largish box you might rack as an example (Dual-socket Sandy Bridge Xeon, ~256GB RAM, SSD, approximately a cr1.8xlarge), that box costs about $30k annually on AWS.  You can buy it for around $8k.  Over two years with hosting costs, you&#x27;re looking at around $10k vs $60k roughly.  Numbers work out similarly for other instance types although you would need some scale - perhaps a dozen of these systems - for this to make sense for your application.<p>Netflix I think is a special case - video delivery which they almost certainly don&#x27;t do from AWS is their biggest cost - api/web traffic would be dwarfed in comparison, so who cares if it&#x27;s expensive on AWS in that case?  They probably enjoy the flexibility of AWS more than the little bit of money they might save by doing it themselves.

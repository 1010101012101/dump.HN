I find it disturbing that other commenters in this thread would evidently use this program if they had a chance.<p>I can sense the downvotes already... but let me explain why this program is terrible. If I charged everyone a tax, and threatened people with violence if they didn't pay up, then everyone would recognize it was wrong. When government does it, the brainwashed masses think it's a good thing. But it is bad when the government taxes people just like it would be bad if I taxed people. It doesn't matter what the government does with the money (which is mostly wasted, but that's beside the point). It is still wrong.<p>To rat someone out who opts not to pay for the protection racket that is taxes is to participate in the crime of stealing their wealth. That is why this program is terrible. It converts ordinary citizens into criminals.<p>Government has one tool that legitimate organizations don't have: force. Because it is wrong to force people to do stuff, government is immoral. Government is therefore a criminal organization, like a scaled up version of the mafia. If these ideas appeal to you, I recommend reading the works of Murray Rothbard, in particular ""For a New Liberty"", but his books on economics will also set you on the right path.",1315280964

2964026,comment,2963861,2963861,8,0,Ogre,,,"This is one of the things the Amiga did really well.  Among its specialized hardware was the Copper, which was a very simple processor whose clock was tied to the video clock.  You could use it to schedule blits (using the Blitter, another special bit of hardware whose specialty was moving rectangular bits of rasters around) and other operations (like moving hardware sprites around) immediately after the CRT beam passed the location where it was being drawn.  So with careful planning, you could get all your draws done without tearing and without having to resort to double buffering.<p>I recall hearing that the reason the Video Toaster was an Amiga exclusive piece of hardware was the availability of the video clock as well.<p>I miss that stuff.  But not all the time, double and triple buffering are certainly much easier.  It was also possible quite easily to do double buffering on the Amiga, and I think it was probably much more common than the bare-metal copper approach.  But for people who really wanted that level of control, it was there.",1315280555

I'll add that to my reading list.<p>To clarify: I've always taken the plot of ""Idiocracy"" to be fictional fantasy, and I simply used Wikipedia articles as a short-hand to summarize the ideas advanced by the movie.  I realized that such a plot is so charged with the potential to offend people, I've never had a conversation with anyone about it (after all, we all think we're on the 'sweet' side of the curve, right?). Personally, I don't think such a brain drain could occur, but I'm always interested in research about such topics.<p>Also: thanks for pointing out the importance of the IQ/intelligence debate. From what I've seen in my reading, IQ is really a proxy for a few things: quality of education, social advantages, etc. I agree 100% that IQintelligence; the Wikipedia articles in question should be rewritten to reflect this fact.<p>However, while IQ does not represent intellectual horsepower, it has been shown to be that aforementioned _proxy_ for other sociological and other factors -- in that sense, it is still useful to compare IQ with fertility.

2964023,comment,2963757,2963954,10,0,tzs,,,"Tax laws generally start out simple, then get complex patching holes. My favorite example.<p>Once upon a time a long time ago, a company wanted to pay a dividend to shareholders. That would be taxed as ordinary income to the shareholders. The company's accountants had a brilliant idea.<p>1. Do a stock split. Say, 105 for 100.<p>2. Do a stock buyback, where the company buys back 1/21 of the outstanding shares.<p>Net result to shareholders: every 100 shares becomes 105, then the company buys back 5 out of every 105, leaving the shareholder with 100 and some cash. Since the cash came from the sale of stock, it's capital gains.<p>The tax code was fixed so this would not work, by inserting a new section that gives conditions that a stock buyback must meet to be considered a stock buyback. If it fails to meet the conditions, it is considered to be equivalent to a dividend distribution and taxed as such. The conditions have to take into account a bunch of factors, so as to not penalize legitimate buybacks but not leave holes that allow abuse.<p>I believe that a large part of the complexity of the tax code comes from this kind of thing.",1315280493

On the way out of the auditorium I was punched in the side of the head and some other kid ripped up the paper certificate. It wasn't nice, I was scared of other kids and went very quiet/introverted and focused on escapism... which ironically probably made the creative as I spent all my time imagining, drawing, reading.<p>I have boxes of awards, I think I've won some sort of award every year of my life without trying. This year I won an advertising award. I've never worked in advertising, I just got approached as I was running an online news team. I suggested an idea, prototyped, it sold, industry choked on how left field it was, and now I have an award for being the top advertising creative person of 2010.<p>I'm quite an extrovert these days as I got past most of that sort of stuff... but its still there.

I would usually try and get out of it if I could but often people don't quite understand the concept enough they don't feel comfortable making the sell.<p>It was only working on a project and management decided to do a team building day. They brought in psychologists to do pshycho-analysis so we could see each others benefits and flaws, and they where blown away by my results and offered me to participate in some other tests they had (as I turned out to be an anomaly and they don't often just stumble across prime research people).",1315278228

The article didn't seem to be talking about business-level stuff as much as non-business-focused decisions.<p>I did mention that Dell is used a lot by businesses for service, and I know many companies that go with Dell <i>just</i> because of the service.  That's largely out of the realm of most consumer-level experiences with the Dell brand (my grandparents never had a Dell repairman show up to fix the hard drive, and I'm not sure Dell even had an option to pay $$$ to get someone to come out).<p>Also, I was speaking as an individual consumer - I could have said 'Dell' instead, but in both cases the issue's the same for me.  As a consumer, my experiences with HP, Compaq and Dell have been pretty abysmal over the past decade, and I'm not hearing about any fundamental shifts in their businesses that would increase my faith that I'll have a better experience with their products in the future.  A spec sheet touting low-power chips, increased wi-fi coverage, lighter screens, etc - none of those will bring me back as a consumer.  For businesses, they'll pay a premium for top-notch support (and they do - Dell/Lenovo/others).  For consumers, we don't really seem to be given this option.",1315278095

2963927,comment,2961594,2961968,1,0,luke_s,,,"I have just completed an R&D project for my company on using JQuery Mobile, with knockout.js, so perhaps I am qualified to answer this.<p>As another commenter pointed out JQuery Mobile (JQM) is following on from JQuery UI, not from straight JQuery.  Knockout.js is a databinding and templating system.  As such JQM and knockout.js are complementary instead of competing.  Our system used knockout for databinding into the JQM UI.<p>My recommendation coming out of the R&D project was to use knockout for production apps and to continue to watch JQM, but not use it for production just yet.  JQM is still evolving rapidly - there were a number of major changes made during our R&D project.  We also ran across a number of issues making JQM work with knockout.  For example JQM didn't like knockout changing some of the HTML dynamically, after JQM had been initialised.  The JQM team are aware of the problems dealing with changing HTML via javascript and we saw a number of fixes committed during the course of our R&D project.  One day soon JQM will be very good, but its not quite there yet.<p>Furthermore not every mobile application will benefit from JQM.  Unless you are building an essentially forms and data driven application, it may not be very useful.  Depending on your needs you will be able to get very far by using knockout to produce clean semantic markup, then just applying CSS over the top.",1315278037

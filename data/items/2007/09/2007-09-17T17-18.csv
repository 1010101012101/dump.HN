55789,comment,55643,55696,0,0,bp,,,"The text you quoted points to a real flaw in thinking on the part of the EU commission.  If the commission has a problem with Microsoft due to monopoly practices, that is one thing.  However, once they state they are seeking for Microsoft's products to reach a certain point of market share, they are on a very slippery slope.  <p>This just points to socialist thinking in that the EU commission wants the market to be divided 'fairly'.  The commission should be focused solely on specific incidences of anti-competitive practices and specific resolutions.  They should never be interested in arranging the market just right so that companyA has 50% share, companyB has 20%, etc.  <p>The fact that the commission is focusing on this really brings credibility questions to mind and makes me wonder what their real goals are.  <p>At the risk of bringing another contentious point into an already contentious topic, if this were an EU-based company, would the findings be the same?

55778,comment,55643,55696,0,0,hello_moto,,,"IBM, Oracle and some other big software house actually charge more than Microsoft (sometime even double). I know this because I've talked to one of the MS product unit manager regarding MS prices. <p>I don't think there's any company that has offering such as MSDN subscription. <p>In the sense of their products are crappy.... I'd say that is a statement with no reasonable arguments. Vista Ultimate comes with Windows Media Center which is far more usable and better than Apple Front Row. <p>I would extend my argument further that there is no software company out there that can provide the services/features as good as MS given its size. Most companies died before they can even reach half of MS features. You can argue that's a feature bloat but I need them rather than a set of dis-integrate software with poor interop. <p> ",1190048920
55777,comment,55660,55773,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"I don't understand why people are hyper-focusing on this one attack. Attackers have been cracking passwords, quite effectively, long before tools like Ophcrack were available. Any decent salt scheme beats Ophcrack; it doesn't take much to make hash chain storage infeasible. But you can make your salts longer than JSESSIONID's and they still won't be a speed bump to a ""conventional"" password cracker.<p>I'm not arguing that users should be forced to choose secure passwords. They should, of course, but we're talking about how you store them. If you store them using a single-iteration SHA1 hash, then no matter how you structure your nonces, your scheme is insecure and you should be embarassed.

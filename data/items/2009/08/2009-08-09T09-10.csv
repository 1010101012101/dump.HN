750583,comment,745895,746914,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Google doesn't try and impose themselves between me and the information I'm looking for</i><p>Google's core business revolves around interposing itself between you and the information you're looking for.  Google  Image search excludes certain content from by default.  Gmail filters spam by default. YouTube forbids many kinds of content. They do these things because <i>people want these things</i>. If they filtered information that people <i>did</i> want to access, they would be more likely to call it censorship instead of a useful service.<p><i>I may not like what they're doing in China but I recognize that they have a gun to their heads and that they are being forced into the role of censor.</i><p>Utterly untrue. Google is absolutely not forced to do business in China (or any other country that they alter their results on behalf of).  They <i>choose</i> to censor themselves in order to access that market. (In crystal clear terms: <i>Google censors itself on behalf of government in exchange for money.</i>) If you are morally opposed to doing business with companies that are complicit in content filtering, then you must be morally opposed to using Google.<p>I contend that most people are <i>not</i> morally opposed to this -- they merely think they are.  And further: that this is ok.  But people would be better off admitting this than being selectively ignorant.<p>Google choosing to filter it's results for ""tiananmen square"" is not <i>less bad</i> than Apple choosing not to sell dictionaries that contain the term ""cumdumpster"" in the store that it operates. And yet people in the U.S. are prefer to engage in moral outrage over the latter. <i>This is fucked up.</i><p><i>Apple, on the other hand, seems to delight in meddling in my business.</i><p>Apple is <i>choosing</i> to require content ratings in order to access the market of people who care about content ratings.  There is no evidence anywhere that Apple's content restrictions are in place for any reason other than market pressure to conform to the same moderate standards that most of our culture does. (That is: saying they ""delight"" is a stretch). That you personally do not conform to those standards says nothing about whether Apple, a profit-seeking company, should do so. Also, I would point out that it is not <i>your</i> business being meddled with--Apple does not censor your content at all (and indeed, they did not censor Ninjawords' content). It is Apple's business. They operate a store and they choose what they are willing to sell in it.",1249811767

750564,comment,750408,750493,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""It's not vitamin D. It may be vitamin D or it may be vitamin D + calcium. Why didn't they have a group that was supplementing only vitamin D and not calcium? I don't know, but since they didn't test that, there's no way to know that it is just vitamin D.""</i><p>The first rule of scientific criticism is:  always read the paper.<p>The classic clinical manifestation of a Vitamin D deficiency is rickets -- the direct consequence of a calcium deficiency.  This is because vitamin D is a known enhancer of calcium absorption from the intestine.  All other benefits are hypothetical.  In light of this information, the researchers controlled for the variability of dietary calcium across participants in the study; they chose to supplement calcium for everyone up to the highest US RDA value.<p>Does that mean that it might be the combination of calcium + vitamin D that conveys the greatest benefit?  Well, yes, in fact, that turns out to be true.  But since it's trivially easy to supplement calcium <i>and</i> vitamin D simultaneously (and nearly every vitamin D supplement that you can buy includes a calcium supplement), clinically speaking, it makes no difference.<p>But most importantly, the title of the original paper is <i>""Vitamin D and calcium supplementation reduces cancer risk: results of a randomized trial.""</i> (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17556697?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17556697?ordinalpos=1&#38...</a>), suggesting that the authors are well aware of the relationship between the substances, and are actually <i>interested</i> in the combined effect of calcium and vitamin D.  They wanted to know if calcium + vitamin D had a greater cancer-reducing effect than calcium alone, and found that it did.<p>As for your other critiques, the authors state right there in the abstract of the paper that the results are for postmenopausal women in Nebraska, and they don't try to overgeneralize.  But since the relationship between vitamin D and calcium are the same for men and women, it's really not unreasonable to suggest that the results could apply more generally -- even if you had to adjust the nutrient levels to fit the age, sex and location of the patient.",1249809422

750562,comment,750325,750325,0,0,cwb,,,"Why is the focus on money here? The impact of the technologies they create dwarfs any monetary contributions. What's the value of their technology on top of what the obvious sellable product is? That is, how much more valuable is their product to the user on top of what the obvious product would have been?<p>It affects some products more than others. Productivity tools have high leverage, as do protocols and standards, because they are means to ends. End-user products like food, music, sex (for fun, not reproduction), and housing tend to have little leverage because they are closer to the ends. That is, more of them increases wealth.<p>iPods are good because they let lots of people enjoy more music than before. However, it is probably on slightly better than the obvious product and in any case, the possible impact of a media player is limited.<p>UNIX (or HTTP or C) on the other hand is non-obvious and a fundamental tool impacting work higher up the value chain. These things have enormous impact on wealth because of the knock-on effects of the tools and they afford. Innovation and development is approximately exponential and, rarely mentioned, prone to get stuck in local maxima. Here be dragons. Would we have as powerful an Internet if it weren't for a few key UNIX design decisions? What would a Microsoft designed world-wide computer network look like?<p>Try this: how much time do you think people spend trying to align things in PowerPoint that could be made a snap with better tools (maybe 2007 fixes this)? Let's say 2 min per presentation. With an estimated (by Microsoft) 30 million presentations a day, of which say a tenth are newly created, that means 6 million minutes, or about 11.5 man years, are wasted. Every day. Because PowerPoint doesn't make alignment easy. Not to mention that it may limit people's ideas. What if other Microsoft products have shortcomings more severe than those in PowerPoint?<p>Microsoft products often strike me as <i>worse</i> than the obvious product, prospering because of lock-in/short-sightedness.<p>By giving his money away, I doubt Gates could ever make up for the value creation Microsoft has blocked. He would have to find something with enormous leverage that would otherwise not happen -- don't get your hopes up. Thus, though I hope he proves us wrong, Gates is down in my book as one of the bad guys. Things are looking better now, but we've lost years of exponential innovation.

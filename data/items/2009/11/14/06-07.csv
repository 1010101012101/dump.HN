The debate was whether his fame had anything to do with it, and it did. He would not have been able to make such a move had he not been famous. The fame made it possible and easier for him. You or I certainly wouldn't have been able to effectively promote such a product based on our own personal brands. That's all I'm saying.",1258181628

The process was marred by vague, unresponsive communication, insanely long wait times, and inconsistency.<p>If this whole back and forth between RA and Apple had taken a week instead of almost 4 months, their response probably would have been very different.  They probably wouldn't have left the platform.  The process is broken, and it makes things worse for both developers and users.",1258181599

Unless there is an all-at-once unanimous decision to stop working on the iPhone platform by atleast 80pc of developers, nothing is going to change. The only way that can happen is if someone builds a phone better than the iPhone, and offers developers some kind of massive incentive to shift (which is not likely going to happen in the near future).",1258181433

Thats it. Reminders are nice, but not essential. Same with tagging and organizing todos,  logbook to see when they were completed, searching the todos, etc. Very <i>useful</i> to have, but not <i>essential</i> to the application. A todo list is still a todo list without them.<p>After launch, its much more guided by A. What I personally think would be a nice addition to the application and B. What features are commonly requested by the user. B takes priority over A, if its a paid application. After all, you want users to recommend your product. What better way then to give them something that you know they want?<p>Example: I would want a way to see how often I complete tasks, what days that I'm most productive on, etc. Users request to be able to search todos and edit details.

941504,story,,,2,4,maybeunskilled,"Ask HN: How Can One Correctly Assess Their Own Ability?",,"I am sure that most of you have, by now, heard of ""Unskilled and Unaware of It.""[1] This paper, authored by Justin Kruger and David Dunning in 1999, describes how the least competent tend to overestimate their abilities while the most competent tend to underestimate. The eponymous ""Dunning-Kruger effect""[2], referenced on HN from time to time, serves as an explanation for those unfortunate individuals in our field and in others who possess that toxic mixture of ineptitude and intellectual indolence (they lack the drive to improve, because they see nothing that requires improvement). While providing us with a compelling warning against hubris, it does not seem to provide any further clarity concerning self-assessment; according to Dunning-Kruger, you likely succumb to illusory superiority or illusory inferiority, but either way your perception of yourself is likely to be illusory. One of the authors, Dunning, described how the study shook his confidence: ""I began to think that there were probably lots of things that I was bad at, and I didn't know it.""[3]<p>One might conclude from Dunning-Kruger that since accurate self-assessment appears difficult, you ought to just err on the side of caution and try to underestimate your abilities. After all, what harm can come from that? Unfortunately, this advice seems to contradict insight gleaned from other cognitive bias studies. Take the Pygmalion Effect[4]. Teachers were told that certain students chosen (unbeknownst to the teachers) at random had high IQs and would turn out to be high achievers. The result: those students ended up becoming the high-IQ high achievers that their teachers had been led to believe they were. It would seem from this that one should do the opposite of what Dunning-Kruger intimates; you should overestimate your abilities, assume you are among the elite, and with enough time and effort your reality will come to match your perception of yourself.<p>I feel somewhat torn between not wanting to end up as one of those arrogant incompetents but also not wanting deprive myself of whatever benefits positive thinking might bestow. After all, can you really be successful without some confidence? How do you manage self-perception, confidence and humbleness?<p>1. http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/unskilled.html<p>2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect<p>3. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/01/18/MN73840.DTL<p>4. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect",1258180732

You do not include Apple icons, Apple, logos, screen shots (edit: or pictures) of Apple products, Apple trademarks, other trademarks... OK, it sounds like a long list, but it's really not that bad.<p>You can blame Apple, but part of the blame also has to go to trademark law, which requires them to do this in order to protect their valuable trademarks. Yes, there are other issues besides trademark issues for which the App Store rejects things, but it's amazing how many stories about this boil down to someone not having read the Apple guidelines, or having read them but not believed them.<p>Even Android has rules relating to trademarks:<p><a href=""http://www.android.com/branding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.android.com/branding.html</a><p>Edit 2: I've read the RA ""refutation"" of Lamarche, and it is close to delusional with its implication that a screen shot could not be considered a trademark infringement. The matter is totally open to interpretation, but that is not the point. The important thing is that any company, including Apple, is required to take the strict interpretation if they want to do the best job of protecting their trademarks under the law.",1258179040

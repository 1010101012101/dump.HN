343278,comment,343000,343000,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"I'm naive, but isn't doing something over and over again always a sign that you're doing it wrong? Even if you have to work in PHP and write simple database table management screens all day long, there's nothing to stop you from stepping back a layer, for example by writing programs to write that PHP and MySQL code in whatever language you choose. I believe that if a problem really is trivial in programming, there's always a way to make it trivial.",1224903372
343277,comment,342920,343240,0,0,neilc,,,"The idea that the economy can be saved by entrepreneurs that <i>never</i> need to raise money is sheer lunacy. I can believe that the funding climate might not be someone's primary consideration when deciding whether to start a company; I can also believe that it might not have much influence on the very early stage growth of the company. However, outside investment still plays a fundamental role in the growth and success of most companies of non-trivial size.",1224903222

Is this ""double taxation"" also a cause for moral outrage?",1224903121

343271,comment,342920,343015,0,0,mlinsey,,,"That's interesting (and partly true), but it's nowhere close to the argument being made in the context of political debate about what capital gains taxes should be.  After all, you've presented an argument against <i>all</i> taxes (or at least, all taxes beyond what's necessary to maintain a minimal government).  That's quite frankly a much different (and more fundamental) debate than whether capital gains taxes should be fifteen or twenty five percent.<p>The debate in Washington and in the political media largely centers around whether or not a higher capital gains tax will discourage innovation, which is the argument that Matt is addressing.<p>I think you have a perfectly valid and consistent view, but the original article was most definitely <i>not</i> ""strawmanism"".  It might have been strawmanism if he was writing the article as a reply to you, but he wasn't.",1224902738

If there are too many people invited, they might not feel obligated to respond. What if you had a dedicated invite service and you could not observe the number of people coming (say to a dinner or a party etc). Would you feel more obliged to respond?",1224902175

I've recently become more aware of how easily my own thinking can get knotted up in opinions, and get distracted from the facts or the actual problem.

343259,comment,342920,343015,0,0,jeremytliles,,,"Umm, yeah, and unfettered capitalism does such a wonderful job of allocating resources. Government is terribly inefficient, but what other entity is going to maintain infrastructure, a social safety net, schools, and other basic services from which society benefits? I hate that so much money goes to DOD, TSA, farm subsidies, and the like, but reducing government revenues doesn't force the government to make tough choices, it simply causes it to run an even more unsustainable deficit.<p>By the way, if you lower taxes (and thus government revenue), it's not defense and corporate subsidies that suffer--they always get their piece--it's infrastructure and social programs. The ""starve the beast"" concept simply creates more suffering for those who can't afford things like private schools, expensive out-of-pocket health care, and jet time-shares.",1224901645

He emigrated from the UK as a child, along with his father and uncle. (Who both worked as programmers in the UK) Since he still has British citizenship, we've considered spending a few years in the UK. What's stopped us (so far) is that it seems like programer salaries in Britain are extremely low compared to the cost of living there. Things like housing, food, and transport are 50-100% more expensive in the UK, but the salaries appear to be roughly the same as here in Canada. Worse, it seems like most of the software companies are clustered in the very expensive areas.",1224901048

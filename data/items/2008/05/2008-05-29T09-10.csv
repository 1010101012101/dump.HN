They end up being used as bin liners and sitting in land fills for hundreds of years.<p>The real problem is how to get the microbes to function in landfills so that the contents can degrade at a faster rate.<p>Then you've got the problem of stopping secondary effects in landfills such as water seepage. What happens if high concentrations of these microbes start dissolving plastic water pipes? We could replace one mistake with another.<p>There is a long way to go but the kids made a good start. Ultimately we just need to stop using plastic bags.",1212055004

203159,comment,202665,202764,0,0,trominos,,,"Collatz is completely unapproachable. Sure, anybody can understand what it's saying and run the algorithm on a couple of numbers. Very few people will be able to do anything else with it. (I think that saying that you can ""understand why Collatz is hard"" is disingenuous. Maybe you're admiring the fact that something so simple can be so intractable, but unless you're a phenomenal mathematician you're not understanding it more fully.)<p>Now, YMMV, of course. It's just been my experience—and the experience of my mathematically-inclined friends—that banging your head against a problem that is way out of your league is more frustrating, less rewarding, and less useful than working on something within your abilities. If your goal is a distraction, go with what works, but if your goal is to improve your problem solving abilities, don't act like a spectator—do something you can actually do.",1212054126

A doctor didn't prevent me from dying of malaria, DDT eliminated malaria in the US before I was born. Doctors didn't cure my cholera, other people flushing preventing me from being exposed to it. The NY/NJ water utilities prevented me from being exposed to water-born diseases and my refrigerator/consistent food supply protected me from spoiled food.</i><p>Malaria is still one of the top killers of people world wide, which is why the Gates foundation is funding vaccine research.  There are 300 million people world wide infected with malaria, and 1.5 million people die from malaria each year.  How's that DDT working for them?<p>I'm an ER nurse by trade, and I pick up old medical textbooks in antique shops whenever I can.  There are usually entire chapters on Polio, Tetanus, Tularemia etc...  These are diseases that we just don't see any more.  Why?  Because of vaccines and antibiotics.<p>My uncle, (now a surgeon) almost died in the 40's from a ruptured appendix.  Know what saved his life?  The new miracle drug that had just come on the market:  Sulfa antibiotics.  I haven't seen a person die from a ruptured appendix in years.  Why?  Because of antibiotics and surgery.<p>People used to die from infectious diseases all the time, and they do in the Third World as well.  Yes, prevention and basic sanitation help a lot, but that's not the only answer.<p>Pneumonia used to be a major killer.  It's not anymore.  Why?  Antibiotics and oxygen.<p>I was born with a cleft lip.  I had two surgeries on my lip before I was 1 month old.  My parents took me down to Honduras where they worked in a rural village running a school.  People in the village were shocked that there was something that could actually fix cleft lips.  There were a number of people in that village and surrounding countryside who lived decades with a cleft lip, not knowing that a surgeon could change their lives.<p>To say that medicine doesn't help people is absolutely absurd.",1212054079

It may be compact and light but as you mention, it doesn't have as good a spec and costs more. You're paying for style and size, and unless you travel <i>a lot</i>, is it worth it?",1212052894
203152,comment,203040,203142,0,0,silencio,,,"I was so sick and tired of being able to choose between only silver (the pro laptops) and white (the iBooks) that I vowed my next Apple laptop would be a color I want (black) no matter what. Apple thankfully came out with a black MacBook when I was finally getting sick of my iBook after having sold my PowerBook G4 (it was 17"" and too big). I hounded the salespeople at the local Apple store until they had one in stock.<p>It ended up being cheaper than a ""professional"" paint job (which usually doesn't include the keys) and cleaner than a paint job done by yours truly. The whole laptop is black, including the colored parts of the ports that you can see and the keyboard. I know it doesn't cost them that much to manufacture a black version, but I thought it was well worth it.<p>I don't think many others have been able to pull off charging for a color option, but it's not exactly unheard of (think cars and metallic paint).",1212052852
203151,comment,202918,202918,0,0,lux,,,"Not that it's an actual autobiography, but ""Journey to the End of the Night"" by Louis Ferdinand Celine was based closely on his own life and was really something to read, albeit a tough something to get through at times.<p>I was warned that it would be difficult to relate to as a ""modern-day young democrat"" and in my case at least, they were right.  I've since bought two more of his books though (all of which seem to be fairly autobiographical) and can't wait to read them as well now.<p>A word of caution: Not very inspiring material, just interesting literature.  And it definitely had a profound influence on many subsequent authors.",1212052810
203150,comment,203040,203040,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I have a white MacBook that's about a year old, and it's already taken quite a beating.  I've been in school, and admittedly I have been pretty rough on it.  But there are scratches in the white lacquer, and more disturbingly, there are some cracks in the case, near the trackpad.<p>Since the black MacBook doesn't have the same glossy finish, you won't have the same type of exterior scratches.  But I doubt build quality is actually much different between the two.  I'd be wary of buying another MacBook.<p>The MacBook Air is only about $300 more, but all reports indicate that the build quality is phenomenal.  (Same with the MacBook Pro.)  If you're going to be using the laptop on the road, and you want to keep it a few years, then I'd spend the extra money for the Air.<p>Plus, you're clearly more excited about the MacBook Air... so go for it! :)",1212052700

Not much chance that the MacBooks will be updated, but you never know..but given your timeframes it seems you don't have a choice.<p>My two cents: black MacBook and get extra ram and battery for the same price as an air. The air is a nice machine, but if it's going to be your only computer on the trip, you might want to reconsider (taking into account your budget, length of travel, et cetera).<p>On a sidenote, I've been sorely tempted to buy an air but I've been sidetracked by the vastly cheaper ultraportables (like the eee and hp mininote 2133) that fit in my purse. Something to go between my blackbook and my iPhone. The air doesn't quite fit that niche well and I would be pretty mad if someone stole it or I lost it, while losing an eee wouldn't be as tear-inducing. They don't run (unhacked) OS X, so I can't do some development work (iphone iphone iphone ;) ), but I could do other things on there...and they all do email and web and what have you.",1212052226

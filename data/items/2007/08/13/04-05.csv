41843,comment,41709,41709,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I once suggested on some blog that the death of newspapers would be tragic because bloggers are almost all writing editorials (and often much better than editors do) but almost never peform reportage. Of course, I got <i>flamed</i>. Of course bloggers are reporters.<p>But ""Reporting"" isn't blogging. It isn't even ""writing"". It's going out, learning about a foreign subject in a day, driving/walking/tramping all over the place, interviewing multiple people, establishing government, police, underworld contacts, getting double and triple confirmation on key facts, adhering to rigorous journalistic ethical standards, etc. That's reporting and it isn't fun, and almost no bloggers do it--just like almost no open source writers write accounting software.<p>The first fatality will be local news. God knows why anybody subscribes to local papers, but they do serve the purpose of keeping an eye on local politicians, who have a tendency towards corruption. Once the local rags are gone, I dread what will happen to municipal governments...<p>Does the average blogger want to sit through the Lions' club chicken dinner every Sunday in order to hear the latest about councilman X. Didn't think so...",1186980507

""This intersection has four gas stations--let's stop at one now, like everybody else has.""<p>In fact, like the manager implies, it's more likely that Second Cup will be stealing business from Starbucks than vice versa!<p>It's very simple.  Almost every local and visitor who notices the two coffee shops will automatically think Second Cup must be much better if it's surviving against a franchise setup across the street!  Their curiosity will get the better of them.  The only way Second Cup can lose is if they have a pessimistic attitude with the customers, because word will spread.  The local newspaper will write an article about the coffee business in three months time--it will either say Starbucks is a welcome addition; that they're hurting small businesses; or, in the best case, that both businesses are doing well.  It's free publicity in any case.<p>I think Second Cup will see an increase in out-of-town visitors.  A lot of visitors will have already tried Starbucks coffee elsewhere, and when they're asking for recommendations, the locals will recommend 100 Coffee Street where Starbucks and Second Cup are, than Trevor's Coffee at 23 Vine Drive where there's only one option.<p>But Second Cup won't only benefit from out of town visitors.  The locals will respect Second Cup even more for being the little guy. (Remember, until paired up with the big guy, they were just another small business, like a Laundromat.)  Next, anybody who wants coffee is now much more likely just to drive down that street, and make up their mind on which business to visit while driving there (customers know they don't have to make a decision until they get there, and if one is closed or busy, the other one will be open.)<p>Third, businessmen have a safe bet on taking clients to a coffee shop, as well--whether the client wants a Starbucks they're familiar with or a local flavor.<p>Finally, anybody who runs errands to pick up coffee for a group of employees can easily pickup coffee ordered from either place.<p>The true business that would be hurt in this case would be a 3rd, lonely coffee shop in that town.",1186979976

If the AP can't sell their content, who's reporting in Angola? Who's covering the un-sexy stuff in Nevada elections, etc. <p>The other is the issue of aggregation. It might just be that bloggers are the new journalists and Techmeme/GoogleNews are the new New York Times, so maybe it's not a huge problem, but overall, I think most people aren't interested in building up and filtering RSS feeds to find the news they care about. <p>",1186979818

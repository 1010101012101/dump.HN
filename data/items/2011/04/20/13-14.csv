This means that an event handler that doesn't un-register itself from it's event will never be garbage collected. In the context of a GUI application, this means that you have to be careful to ensure that child windows remove their event handlers when they're closed. Otherwise, your application will leak memory, as the closed windows will never be garbage collected.",1303307998

The differences should have been crystal clear to me. Think of the difference between using your iPhone/iPad/Android and your computer. Notice how everything on your phone occurs nearly instantly. Most of us don't even consider it, because these devices never came with slow magnetic platter drives. Even with minimal (by desktop standards) RAM and absolutely anemic CPU power, these devices manage a level of responsiveness that makes them disappear in to the background as we use the software. An SSD brings this experience to your desktop. The performance difference is present in everything that you do, not just launching applications.",1303307200

The product of their business would be the list of CAs to trust (to be realtime-updated into the browser), they would collect a monthly fee, and would be insuring their users up to amount of $$$ in case one of the CAs on their list screws up (or not, depending on their SLA).<p>This would create a system with two components - on one side ""CA reputation services"", on the other hand - ""CAs"" - watching each other and being vigilant, in an effort to not lose their respective customers.<p>As soon as there is no monopolies, I think this approach could work - and relieve the browser vendors off making the tough decisions. They can still keep the list of root CAs, but just have them all ""off"" by default - so that the tech-savvy could make their own decisions, and publish their own lists, if they want to.<p>The ""CA assurance"" layer would actively fight the attempts to create the monopoly in the CA side (because then they'd be out of business) - and the CAs should not be able to affect the ""CA assurance"" segment since the entry barrier there would be quite low.<p>This approach still does not solve the ""CA sunrise"" problem - making it more difficult for a new CA to enter the market. (But maybe that is a good thing ?)<p>EDIT:<p>however, what this approach <i>would</i> address is the ""local trust"" issue: the said mom and pop shop can very well be trusted by the locally-significant CA assurance service, and not bother with the worldwide paperwork at all.",1303306166

2466498,comment,2463305,2466350,1,0,roel_v,,,"I use PHP only for hobby project nowadays, since that what I used in my last web dev job 10 years ago. So I'm much more comfortable with it than with Python or Rails or any other language in that class, but I don't care one way or the other really - I use C++ in my job nowadays. Just to say, I don't take offense - I have passed the days where I took the software tools I use for a fundamental aspect of me as a person.<p>(That said, full disclaimer: I'm writing a PHP extension in a hobby project for a popular library to use that library from PHP, so in that sense I've moved closer to it again over the last 2 months).<p>Anyway, my main point was that you said ""to point out that PHP's interpreter is in fact rather slow compared to pretty much everything else"", which I still don't agree with. On straight pass-through to C calls, the overhead is a lookup in a hash table for the function name, and some wrapping of arguments into a union if need be. Arrays are slow because they're also implemented as hash tables; for high performance, one can use structures with iterators that can skip this step. But these are all just single data points; I haven't looked into the implementation of the tests you linked to, but I guess it's not that hard to find counterexamples. That's the nature of tradeoffs you make.<p>Your comment seemed to imply that the runtime is somehow deficient, compared to others; I'm still not convinced that is really the issue, especially since PHP is really just C with some wrappers around it. Whereas for example Python apparently does (used to do maybe, I don't know) much more bookkeeping etc for the dynamic features that enable its syntactic niceties. Advances in VM precompilation may catch up with that, but how would it make such progress that it would be <i>faster</i> than the straight-to-C equivalent?<p>Also your mention of hiphop I don't understand. When hiphop compiles something to C++, and then into machine code, it can only be slower than the original PHP code if it changes the algorithms - which are hiphop issues, not related to the speed of the runtime.<p>Anyway I wasn't claiming that PHP is the fastest or best documented; I just don't accept at face value your claim that PHP is <i>significantly</i> slower than other languages in its class on a sufficiently wide range of real-world use cases.<p>(for the documentation, I always liked it - most of it lists the parameters, a simple example and some corners cases, and the comments are great, of course for people who are capable of separating the chaff from the wheat. Actually I think there is still a script in the php source tree written by me that transformed the docbook docs into man page format, so that I could open the docs of the function under the cursor in a split window in vim with a single keystroke; that was in 1999 though and 'parsed' the docbook with regular expressions, so if anyone in their right mind had a look at it in the last 10 years they would've deleted it).",1303306130

PHOTO: AFP/FILE<p>WASHINGTON: The United States worked behind the scenes to help Israel contain UN probes into possible war crimes committed during the 2008 and 2009 Gaza war, Foreign Policy reported on Tuesday.<p>The online foreign affairs magazine cited exclusive WikiLeaks cables detailing moves by the US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to prevent a more thorough UN investigation of alleged abuses during the conflict.<p>Some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during the three-week-long Israeli offensive in December 2008 and January 2009, which was aimed at halting Palestinian rocket attacks.<p>According to one cable, Rice spoke with UN chief Ban Ki-moon three times on May 4, 2009 to urge him to remove recommendations for a wider investigation from a board of inquiry report into attacks on UN sites in Gaza.<p>Rice underscored the importance of having a strong cover letter that made clear that no further action was needed and would close out this issue, the US diplomatic cable said.<p>Ban said his staff was working with the Israeli delegation and called her after the letter had been finalized to report that he believed they had arrived at a satisfactory cover letter.<p>Later that year Israel and the United States pushed back against a similar effort to investigate the war by the UN Human Rights Council, which appointed a team led by the South African jurist Richard Goldstone.<p>The release of the Goldstone probe coincided with US efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and in another cable Rice links the two during a meeting with Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon.<p>Rice told Ayalon that Washington is still studying the report, remains concerned about the fact-finding missions mandate and many of the recommendations in the report, according to the cable.<p>She then urged him to help us help them with progress on the peace process, saying that the report can be more easily managed if there is progress.<p>The Goldstone report said there was evidence that both Israel and Palestinian militant groups had committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, urging independent probes on both sides.<p>Two weeks ago, Goldstone stepped back from the report, saying new information about Israels military actions led him to believe he had erred in concluding that Israel targeted civilians during the 22-day conflict.<p>He cited a UN committee of independent experts that followed up on the report and found that Israel has dedicated significant resources to investigate over 400 allegations of operational misconduct in Gaza.<p>In contrast, the Hamas, the militant group ruling Gaza, have not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against Israel that triggered the offensive, Goldstone wrote.<p>Israel, which bitterly opposed the investigation from the beginning, has since demanded that the United Nations rescind the report.<p>But last week, three co-authors of the report, Pakistani human rights lawyer Hina Jilani, Christine Chinvin, a professor of international law at the London School of Economics and former Irish peacekeeper Desmond Travers, rejected calls to retract it.<p>We concur in our view that there is no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in anyways change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict, they said in a statement to Britains The Guardian newspaper.",1303304571

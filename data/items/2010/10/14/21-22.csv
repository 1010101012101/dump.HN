These are learned abilities.<p>How do we learn them? Two ways. (1) spend time on our own. This can either be brute force (i.e. just exploring every folder over several projects until a pattern emerges) or though a guided tutorial. (2) Ask someone with more experience.<p>As for as (2) goes, when someone asks me a question that I think is trivial, I try to realize that its not trivial to them. This person is asking because they respect my ideas and they think I can save them a good deal of time.<p>I don't hold everyone's hand though.

I think it needs to be made clear that you're talking about ""sociopaths"" in a clinical sense, meaning people with no conscience. This isn't judgmental in itself. And from what I was reading recently, such people do make up somewhat more than 1% of the population, which probably fits into the right proportion for your theory.<p>2. Any amount of self-honesty reveals that I'm a ""clueless"". But I think you paint this in a rather negative light. Because you're discussing things in largely monetary terms, the ""clueless"" come out like dummies. But I believe that in my case, while the monetary side might make me look like a ""promoted loser"", there can be other rewards that even the accounting. This is especially true when the sociopaths that I'm dealing with tend to be ""light side"" rather than ""dark side"". (although I must also admit to the possibility that I'm <i>so</i> clueless that I've even been hoodwinked in this.)<p>3. I've perceived glimpses of Powertalk, but I find it tiresome. I don't <i>want</i> to work that hard.<p>4. The places I've perceived it isn't in business, but in politics (without being judgmental, I think that Bill Clinton was the absolute master of it -- that's an acknowledgment of his brilliance without looking at what he may or may not have used it for). I'd really be interested in an analysis of how these roles play out in the governmental arena. You noted that it's applicable in the ""Goodfellas"" context; I expect it is also for government, although, at least in a democracy, the roles being played and the masks that define them, must be different.",1287093417

1792798,story,,,2,1,haidut,"Ask HN: What NLP features would you find useful (pay for)?",,"I am a co-founder of news startup called Euraeka. The site can be found at http://www.euraeka.com and I have posted about it here:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=670844<p>The bottom line is that given the nature of the startup I had to implement a number of text processing routines using NLP techniques. I am thinking of developing an NLP API with those features for people to build upon. Here is the list I currently have in production:<p>1) Text extraction: i.e. given a URL or the actual HTML, strip all unnecessary junk and return the raw English text. This routing can also parse text into sentences, and words/frequency hashes. Stemming is also available.<p>2) Tagging: i.e. extract the top N representative words.<p>3) Text summarization: automatically extracts the top N most representative sentences for a given article. Basically automatic text summarization.<p>4) Cognitive fluency - i.e. a numerical decsription (range 0 to 1) of how difficult is to comprehend a given text.<p>5) Author intelligence - i.e. a numerical description (range 0 to 1) of what is the estimated verbal IQ of the author of the text.<p>6) Named Entity Recognition and Extraction - i.e. given a text, mark all entities in it that represent a person, place, or event. Examples would be this sentence: ""Secretary <person>Clinton</person> is expected to <event>visit</event> <place>Pakistan</place> to discuss ongoing military cooperation"".<p>7) Semantic similarity between two texts: i.e. a process that given two texts returns a similarity measure on how semantically close the texts are. This is NOT a simple word overlap comparison. This takes into account context similarity which is much more powerful. For example a simple word similarity measure would return no similarity between the text ""Senator X visited Pakistan"" and ""Senator Y visited Afghanistan"". However the semantic similarity would return a high number based on the context that both sentences are about similar political figures visiting neighboring countries related in terms of the war on terrorism.<p>8) Typing effort: i.e. a measure on how difficult was the text to type: i.e. a physiological measure that gives an estimate on how much effort went into typing the text. For instance words that requires typing keys that are far from each other on the keyboard are harder to type then words with keys close to each other.<p>9) Text mood classifier: i.e. automatic classification on positive/negative mood of the text.<p>10) Text style classifier: i.e. automatic classification on subjectivity/objectivity of the the text.<p>11) Topic classifier: i.e. automatic classification of text into general topics like business, politics, science, technology, etc.<p>So my question is - which ones of those do you think would be worth exposing into an API? Any of those have potential as premium service? Do you have any additional ones to suggest that I can implement?",1287093227

1792791,comment,1792353,1792353,0,0,jessriedel,,,"So, the strongest and most common objection against the English rule is that it would prevent the poor from suing even if they had a good case; they just couldn't afford a 10% chance of owing thousands of dollars.  I am very sympathetic to this objection.<p>But can't this be (mostly) solved by having the <i>lawyers</i> take on the risk?<p>Already, lawyers will offer to work for free unless the plaintiff wins.  (""You pay nothing unless we recover on your behalf."")  That is, they risk their own <i>time</i>--but will do so only if they think there is a good case.  This makes sense because it is the lawyers, not the plaintiffs, who are best able to assess the likelihood of winning.<p>So then couldn't lawyers also take on the risk of paying fees if the litigation is unsuccessful?  Is this legal in the US or elsewhere?  Is it done?<p>(Also, I think I heard somewhere about a guy who couldn't afford to sue a large company which stole his invention.

You can play in a super high level language like Lisp, or you can mold silicon.  Somewhere you have to choose your level of abstraction.<p>If I am teaching somebody how to think about an algorithm like sorting an array, worrying about memory allocations is tangential, an inconvenient burden C delivers unto us.  If I want to teach them about working with memory, pointers, and so forth, C is an excellent language for the job.<p>A crazy thing is happening here when we look down upon beginners who want something that feels like a natural language.  Why CAN'T we simply say, ""I want an app that opens two windows: one with a list of my music files, and the other with cassette controls.  Make it so.""?  Someone could develop a language that does this; AppleTalk, for example, has some crazy high-level stuff similar to this.<p>We have been mentally shackled by our languages.  We think in them.  It is hubris to suggest that this the canonical way to think when programming, that, for example, ""i = i + 1"" is the idiom for incrementing a variable.<p>I do believe, to be truly effective in our line of work, that our beginners must eventually come to an understanding of the platform upon which they develop.  They must understand memory concepts.  They must understand timing concepts.  They must understand multiprocessing concepts.<p>But there is no reason to ram C down some poor soul's throat as a first experience.

1792774,comment,1792537,1792537,0,0,lkrubner,,,"Folks looking for a practical place to start with Lisp should consider using the Emacs editor. I just recently went down this road myself. I am now a huge fan.<p>For about 6 months in 2006 I made Emacs my default editor. (Xemacs, actually). But I did not learn Lisp, at that time, and there are other IDE's out there that have a nicer GUI. So I started using simple text editors like Kate, and then sometimes NetBeans.<p>And yet, for years, I've been wanting to work with a fully scriptable editing environment. I often have the need to grab a large amount of text data, transform it in various way, and save the finished product. I kept thinking that at some point I would learn sed and awk, but I never got around to it. Usually, if I needed to make some quick changes to text, I'd write a one-off PHP script to do what I needed.<p>Then I got interested in Clojure, and through Clojure I got familiar with Lisp's syntax.<p>Then it occurred to me to go back to using Emacs. So now it is my main editor, again, my default programming environment. I use it for everything. And I've learned Emacs Lisp. Every single day, the combination of Emacs and Lisp helps me be more productive.<p>Way back in 1999, I started to learn PHP. One thing that made PHP easy to learn, back then, was that I did not need to compile it. I only needed to put it on a server running PHP, and that was most servers. It was an easy programming environment to step into.<p>Lisp is like that when you are working in Emacs. You can write a line of Lisp anywhere you like, then invoke it with a special key command. You can write quick one-off scripts to move text around inside a file. Or, if you like some code and want to reuse it, you can just save it as a function and put it in your .emacs file and then that function is available to you whenever you are running Emacs.<p>I have heard of Emacs greatness since at least 1999, and yet somehow, not till this year did I dive deep and learn both it and Lisp. I realize now, everything that people have said about Emacs over the years, it really is true - to have a programming environment where every element of the environment can be programmed and re-programmed using the language of the environment gives you an extremely powerful tool.<p>If anyone is looking for a simple place to get started with Lisp, I would say, simply, use Emacs. We all need to edit stuff, and so your work will provide you with a practical place to practice your Lisp, everyday.<p>Those of you who prefer some kind of GUI, look into Xemacs. It can be set up to respond to your mouse-clicks.<p>Also, if you'd like to learn about Emacs and Lisp, the book that Robert J Chassell wrote is a very good introduction:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Emacs-Lisp/dp/1882114027/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1287092649&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Emacs-Lisp/dp...</a>",1287092687

If someone calls you a Nazi, they are calling you something horrible. But if someone calls you a homosexual, even if they do it in an insulting manner, they aren't saying anything horrible about you at all. They are just showing their own ignorance and bigotry through their choice of words.<p>So that's why I objected to indirect comparison of calling someone a Nazi vs. calling someone a homosexual.",1264345094

I assume it's an act of impulse by one of their employees, I would be amazed if it was actually discussed and cleared by their PR department.

1073321,comment,1071623,1073223,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Thanks for the upvote! ;)<p>I think we have a misunderstanding here. First thing to clarify, I think, is whether the owner of the ""avtr"" name gave it up willingly. If he didn't, the discussion it closed: it was at best bullyish. But what I understood from the article is that it was mutual:<p>> ... but I wanted to explore opportunities to work with you to acquire the name. In the past, we have offered product in exchange for social domain names. One case in mind was for the new movie Avatar , we were able to give promotional items to the owner of twitter.com/avtr for Coke Zero.<p>I read this as a transaction. Now, the GP is still very very upset. Personally, I think it simply isn't GP's business what the avtr owner did with his domain. It's very much like Richard Stallman berating you rudely in public for buying commercial software. His ideals, just like GP's, should not dictate what one does with his property, time and money. If the GP thinks offering ""useless plastic crap"" was an offence, he's free to reject such an offer whenever it's made to him. But I do not understand why we should all align to his standards and refuse transactions we may find profitable or charitable or just the right thing to do. Not to mention that a promotional item can easily be anything from a t-shirt to a bike or a car.<p>Now again, if I misunderstood something I apologize. But I find the GP to be the one trying to push things here, not the big corporation.",1264344164

In these reviews, the flux along various routes was measured and routes with too low a level of traffic, mainly branch lines, were targeted for closure. At the same time, major routes were strengthened to cope with the expected source-sink relationships for both passenger and freight traffic. Interestingly, the reports focussed on efficient rather than any explicit consideration of resilience, which may explain the sensitivity of the current UK rail network to disruption.""<p>Where:

There are A LOT of these people out there - hence ComScore has done OK for themselves. Unfortunately I agree that over the long term, their importance in the world of media buying will dwindle, and they will become more of a competitive research tool used by middle management and tech bloggers to re-enforce their viewpoints.",1264342807

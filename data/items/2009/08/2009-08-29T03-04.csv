The problem is, 9/10 sites for bands just don't let you share data (some examples: Virb, PureVolume, Reverbnation, Sonicbids).  And they are extremely protective of the data they have.<p>Derek does mention the idea of customer support logging into Facebook accounts to update the content manually.  That is fine for a few dozen sites, but to scale that you would need a huge staff.  We're not just talking about entering NEW shows, but also being able to modify them at the last minute when data changes.  That is very hard with 10,000+ bands.<p>The end result is, until all these sites create an open platform to share info, it just is not possible to make a cost-effective solution to make one step entry happen.  I wish it was.<p>In the meantime, we are integrating with all the sites that DO offer open solutions (Twitter, Eventful, etc)",1251517086

I'm also curious what Mark will do staying on as CEO - if it's solely a tech sale (as the listing suggests) and there are no customers, his role will be...transitioning the new developer(s) onto the system?<p>Not to diminish Mark's work, but this sure sounds like a small payment to buy some technology, and a press release to make both parties sound like much larger entities than they are.",1251516001

What is actually required is a training wheels level program or book outlining how and where to get the clients. Yes, some of us may have gotten lucky, or had a break that flew into our lap - this is not the rule. And in fact, anything else other than the rule is noise. Getting paying clients should be a key goal of any business. Selling your personal anecdotal experience does not help unless it is distilled into a repeatable formula.<p>I would like to point out that I've been at this game for a short while with mixed results. What has worked in my favor, well in favor of getting closer to winning a bid or getting paid: clean business presence, professional copy, actually rephrasing all requirements back to the client and how I'm going to solve his problem, not lowering my prices at all - I keep my bids in the upper 25% of what I perceive the ceiling to be, be attentive to every minutiae that seems core-like to the project, communicate without long delay regardless of level of inquiry - no question is too trivial.<p>Above is a result of unintentional lack of effective execution and then actually committing to being a better manager rather than an engineer. I didn't understand that while I was confident in my abilities to get the job done, I still didn't get that job because I didn't prove it to the client and sold myself.<p>Avenues that I used on and off: cheap advertisement on radio, local newspaper, business directory, offered to sponsor two contests, scavenged elance, offered promo work for free just like what the other fellow is doing on HN. Regardless, it is hard and not steady. I can tell that specialization and asking for a monthly retainer to offer pre-allocated hours to specific clients is probably the key to crossing that income stability threshold.",1356663120

There are other OSes, including Blackberry OS and various Windows versions, out there an actual phones already, too. At best, FirefoxOS is starting at 5th or 6th in line, although it's probably further back than that. That's a lot of catching up to do, especially given that it isn't really revolutionary or unique in any beneficial way.<p>Android and iOS give developers much more flexible environments to work with. To many experienced developers, especially those with a diverse background, being forced to use JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS is just not going to be seen as an advantage. If anything, it should be considered a reason not to target Firefox OS.<p>Things haven't been very bright for Mozilla lately, either. Firefox's usage is dropping, in favor of Chrome and even IE in some cases. This isn't surprising, given how it has been one mistake after another since Firefox 4. Thunderbird is on the rocks. Firefox for Mobile has been a complete failure. Aside from Bugzilla, which is looking pretty outdated these days, their other projects don't have much of a user base.<p>When one takes an impartial look at Firefox OS, there's just nothing compelling about it. There's no reason for its existence, and it doesn't really offer anything we couldn't already do. It seems to me to be more of a ""we can do that, too!""-style project driven by vanity, rather than any real need. They'd be better off putting the effort toward improving Firefox on the desktop, which seems to be their only remotely viable project.",1356661404

But any company can build a chemical factory wherever the patent laws are favorsble. In reality the difference was cultural: Germans have had a kick-ass chemistry culture since alchemy turned into chemistry.<p>The chapter explains dye manufacturing changes with patent laws. To anyone with chemistry knowledge, this is ludicrous to the point of deliberate dishonesty. Dyes are embarrasingly easy to discover. If you take an existing dye structure and make a tiny chemical change, the new material is probably colorful and is not covered by the patent on the original dye.<p>In fact, a lot of early pharmaceutical work was done by taking chemical libraries from dye companies and screening their thousands of structures for biological activity.<p>The argument against patents on the basis of ""me too"" drugs is also ludicrous. The chapter actually says that patents are damaging because they give patients <i>too many choices</i>: there is no need to waste the money on having all those alternatives. In reality, there is huge variation between similar drugs. Many variants turn out to work better for different people, and some variants turn out to have unacceptable side effects. The only way to find out is to make a bunch of alternatives and try them all out.<p>The chapter becomes even more ludicrous by saying thst the COX-2 inhibitors are just a wasteful duplicate of cheap ibuprofen. Folks, ibuprofen and related drugs kill probably a few hundred thousand people a year with side effects. They're more dangerous than Al Qaeda. (Although by bad luck it turned out that the aCOX-2 inhibitors were worse, but in a different way.)<p>The chapter makes the absurd claim that patents hurt drug discovery and patients, ignoring the elephant in the room of generics manufacturers. If patents were so harmful to innovation, the the generic companies would be leading they way with new drugs. They are most emphatically <i>NOT</i>. Except for a few minor formulation chsnges, they do nothing of their own.",1356660930

While in the US a vast number of people want to create their own business or already did when they are quite young, running a business or starting one is a herculian task in Germany. And you get punished when you fail. And you get taxed to death when you don't. Running a company can easily become a social stigma too. Even if starting your company happens to be easier now then it was 10 years ago, still the majority of people are rather focused on finding a secure position in a larger company with lots of benefits then ""creating"" something ""new"". \nNumerous reasons I guess for why that came to be (I don't think it was like that in the 50s/60s) - maybe as society ages there is less of a ""drive"" for radical innovation and a risk-averse mentality becomes mainstream. Either way, before I came to the US I had heard about ""the difference in mentality"" but I could not believe how ""different"" it really was and how much of an impact that meant on a daily basis: the biggest eye-opener was the completely different attitude towards things that needed to be changed and people just ""did it"".",1356660285

I write relatively error free, bullet proof code, but I am very, very slow. So the value isn't there, even if the code can be left alone for a long time. There are markets for that, but not in the languages at which I excel, and I have zero interest in learning others. Less than zero.<p>I would, however, hire me any day of the week as a system architect, especially one who had to work with non-technical people and translate vague requirements into something that could work.<p>I would also hire me, any day of the week, as a software development manager, senior manager, or VP (sorry, don't want the job, consulting is too sweet a gig): I am very, very good at estimating (design, development, test, documentation), organizing all of that, and managing it, and managing the people who manage it. I've been a pretty good shit-shield for my staff, keeping away all organizational disruptions.<p>I excel with mixed bag teams where I get to set architectural direction with the assistance of a few really bright people, and set organizational priorities for that team, and for the broader team: What we develop is what you sell, what you need to sell is what we will develop.<p>Perhaps your path lies therein, somewheresomehow. If you have technical skill and people skill and vision and strong sense of what could go wrong and how to mitigate it, there will be places for you.<p>(I hate sales. I like the product management aspect of marketing, and some of the branding aspects, but despise a lot of the rest. Operations? Bleagh. Of course, I do all of that as a one-man-shop, but as a necessity to enable what pays the bills. YMMV, of course. If you want to lead a shop, learn those, you'll need to understand them.)",1356660157

The numbers of minds captivated with stories told by the likes of Carl Sagan are, as you mentioned, orders of magnitude bigger than what Appelbaum could accomplish. But take Mikko Hypponen or Moxie Marlinspike - great speakers with great things done - would you say that they come even close to what Noam Chomsky reaches with his talks? I don't have concrete data on this, but I do believe the answer to be a clear no. And that's maybe because the majority of the population of the world isn't as interested in computer security as they are in debates about religion, science, politics, sports, consumer electronics or whatever. Maybe this field is just too young to be a permanent part of day-to-day concerns or to have more than a couple of tens of thousands of people interested in it. And maybe that's why it's probably worth considering supporting the few public figures this field has.",1356660152

Of course if you want, you can sign up for AdWords and get something like a free $100 credit just for signing up. Then you spend that by buying keywords that people might use for a query that your page would answer. That is called 'search engine marketing' (SEM) and once you burn through the free stuff you'll have to decide if its worth buying more ads or not.",1356660097

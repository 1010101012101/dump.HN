But I couldn't recreate it because ""logicholeflaw"" was already in use!<p>After a while I figured out that capitalization counts. But still, it was a bit confusing.",1200585108
99803,comment,99666,99729,0,0,sspencer,,,"I felt vaguely ridiculous as an American traveling in London for this exact reason.  I have decent shoes that I wear all over the place:  they are made of leather, they are (I guess?) relatively stylish.  But in England I felt like I was a homeless person wandering around with cardboard boxes on my feet.  It's always interesting transitioning from a country where no one cares what you look like to nearly any place in Europe, where Appearance Matters(tm)!<p>On the whole I like the European model a little less since I always feel a little outclassed, even just going to a market or something.   But Europeans traveling in America are probably in a constant state of disgust at the disheveled state of most of us...",1200584988

It would hardly be my first mistake, nor will it be the last.<p>But then I read this:<p><i>""... he would not confirm when (or if) Yahoo would also allow become</i> [sic.] <i>what is called a ""relying party"" (allowing users with third party OpenIDs to log in to Yahoo). He did say that the goal was to move in that direction, but gave no further guidance.""</i><p>OpenID! Where all IDs are equal, but some IDs are more equal than others!<p>Yahoo is hardly alone. I can't find an OpenID login on AOL or Facebook, either. Blogger (aka Google) supposedly ""supports"" OpenID, but their login page doesn't let me use one.<p>These big ""adopters"" sure are happy to <i>provide</i> OpenIDs, in exchange for detailed information about which sites you log into and when. But they're understandably reluctant to <i>accept</i> OpenIDs, because what's in it for them but a support headache, a loss of control over the customer relationship, and more data for their competitors?<p>Remind me again why this isn't just the Mexican-standoff version of Microsoft Passport, with a soundtrack by Ennio Morricone? I guess it's nice that I can now <i>choose</i>, site by site, which of my corporate overlords is going to own all my login data. And we get to watch as Mike Arrington and Tim O'Reilly force Google, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, and Facebook to play chicken, a spectacle which will sell a few banner ads.<p>In other news, there are now 360 million OpenID holders, just as there were once 360 million AOL CD owners. [1] Do OpenIDs make good coasters?<p>[1] <i>Note: one of these statistics was made up for entertainment purposes. Do not cite on Wikipedia.</i>",1200584838

99800,comment,99447,99680,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"As far as I know, the price regulation doesn't generally extend to internet connectivity (it's for voice lines)... except for the lowest tier connection they offer (that mythical dry loop 768k line for $10/mo)... and the phone reps will actively deny that account option even exists unless you insist that you know it does.<p>My guess is they want to start a content delivery system of some sort to sell music/video to a captive audience (their customers) and just want to prepare the ground for blocking out competing pirated content.<p>This guy doesn't make the best argument in the world, but I think the privacy issues of this alone should kill it.

Doing otherwise might increase the perception that their work is something which could instead be done by a permanent employee.<p>No axe to grind, worked both sides of that fence. Not sure if I think there is much truth to it. I do know some odd-looking consultants though :-)",1200583613

99792,comment,99755,99755,0,0,pingswept,,,"It seems that Yahoo is allowing users to use their Yahoo IDs as OpenIDs. This will make some other sites want to use OpenID for authentication, because who wants to manage credentials if you don't have to?<p>However, if I'm understanding it correctly, this will not allow people to use OpenIDs that are not obtained from Yahoo to log in to Yahoo.<p>It seems to me to be solving half of the problem (needing new credentials for every website) but not the other half (having a corporation be the repository for those credentials).<p>If anyone with more of a clue can explain to me how this is not a base perversion of one of the major ideas behind OpenID, I would be obliged.

In four hours of asynchronous communication, he did two design iterations, got feedback on both, and fixed a bug that someone found.  And this was unplanned, in response to unsolicited feedback.  What else should he have done to slow it down more?",1200582018

We got a little over 1000 signups and tons of great feedback.<p>Tichy, the drawing is done with a Canvas tag and the IECanvas hack to get it to work in IE.  Drawing with DHTML is really nothing new, but until recently you had to do it with tons of colored DIV tags.  SVG and Canvas make life a lot easier for something like this.<p>yaacovtp, Thus far it seems the number one use case for this thing is to facilitate the drawing of balls onto things.  Followed by tic tac toe.  Followed by work.  I bet it will become a bit more useful once we fix some of the major issues people found yesterday, and add some new features to make it more suited to its intended task of team collaboration.<p>Anyway, I'd encourage folks to check back in a few weeks to see if we've made any progress.  Thanks again for all the great feedback!<p>Jason",1176227422

11372,comment,11110,11110,0,0,irakundji,,,"ABSOLUTELY!  The education system as we know it is a socialization process.  I makes mindless zombies very well but I fear that it swishes personalization and creativity in process.  Is it not a wonder that those kids who walk to the beat of their own drum in school becomes successful and those who always followed the rules become great paper pushers?  That's what school does, it teaches us to seek an approval that's external to us (ie. teacher's approval, grades, awards) and not a sense of internal approval (ie. pride, enjoyment, satisfaction).  We all get at least nearly 2 decades of this socialization process to be pounded into a mold (whether we're round, or rectangle or rhombus, we're all going into that square hole, because that's the only way to succeed in school, and if we don't, we're deemed a freak and forced to be medicated and the like).  It's that same mold that we must break free from if we're to draw into the inner creativity, that inner peace.  I think after we've done so, we'll all be a lot happier and much more productive.  --- Sorry for the ranting, it's a touchy subject. ",1176227111

11369,comment,10789,11004,0,0,zach,,,"I liked the Brad Bird interview, but I was totally blown away by the Spline Doctors' podcast with Andrew Stanton.  I was like, yeah, the Nemo guy, I guess he's a writer... okay, so I didn't know his backstory with Pixar or anything about him and it just was an amazing interview to me.<p>Anyway, I wanted to explain the emphasis I put on just how much you want to really desire to create what you're making, to be dying to get it in front of people.  So here's the part I wanted to excerpt from the interview that really gives you folks in News.YC-land the sense of how driven you want to be:<p>---<p>Interviewer Andrew Gordon: What would you say is the hardest thing about directing an animated movie?<p>Andrew Stanton: The hardest thing about directing an <i>animated</i> movie is keeping yourself excited about it.  It's hard enough to make the crew excited about it, but keeping yourself excited about it -- trying to remind yourself why you wanted to do it.  Because it's all about the details once you really start making the movie.<p>It's no different than building a house, or, building a really extravagant mansion.  There's a million details that you have to spend more time with after the bigger ideas of where the rooms are going to go and how it's going to be structured, and it can get you kind of bogged down.<p>Joe Ranft used to have this great expression that there's always a point during the making of a movie where there's sort of the Columbus where-is-the-land moment, where everybody on the boat is going ""You promised us the land.  Where's the land?  We're not seeing it!""<p>And people get bogged down in all the minor problems or the major problems that won't go away, and it's all justified -- it's all legitimate to have that response.<p>So, for me, to prevent that is to get really, really picky about what story you're going to tell up front.  And this is my opinion, and it's not a rule.  But if I have an idea that I kinda like, then I don't want to do it.  If I have an idea that affects every fiber of my being, like ""I want to see that movie made whether I make it or not"" -- it's like that idea <i>has</i> to get on the screen -- that's a real good quality to start with.  Because it's going to get attacked for the next four years.  And there's going to be, sometimes, weeks or months where nothing seems to be going right.<p>[...]<p>It's like looking for oil or something -- it's like ""where can I find something that has enough fuel that's going to keep me going for years?""  Because there's going to large stretches of time where nothing is working, nobody's happy, everybody thinks that the sky is going to fall, and what's going to get me out of bed is just because that idea still <i>has</i> to be on the screen.<p>So I want that when I'm going to go into battle.  Because it's going to be battle.  So if I don't have that going in, then I won't go into it -- I won't make that movie.  And I'm starting to try and insist on that with other filmmakers here at Pixar, because I just know the benefits of it.",1176226842

737156,comment,736794,736976,0,0,halo,,,"The issue is that they're both flawed solutions and you should pick the solution that's the least worst depending on what you're trying to do. Sometimes that's tables, sometimes that's CSS, sometimes it's some combination of the two. They both have advantages and disadvantages.<p>Saying ""CSS dropped the ball, and that CSS failed to incorporate tools for describing layouts in table-based ways"" is an incredibly oversimplified summary. Back in 1996, CSS1 was published and while the styling was incredibly well-thought-out, the layout part of it was somewhat tacked on (somewhat to its detriment), with the aim that CSS2 would tackle the complex layout issues that needed to be addressed. CSS2 was introduced in 1998, except no-one implemented much of it for years, most notably display:table which gets the most of the advantages of using CSS and tables within CSS. Sometime around 2002 or so (after the death of Netscape) someone realised you could hack around with 'float' property (introduced in CSS1 and well-supported) to achieve column-like layouts.<p>Once IE6 and IE7 dies we can finally switch to display: table. I'll give an optimistic estimate of this happening in 2013, but it really depends on how long XP/Vista last.",1249196238

I never rely on `this` unless I'm inside of a $.each call because it's so implicit and error prone.<p>If you're trying to use bind with a function that you've written, I'd say just rewrite it to not use `this`. It'll make it clearer. If it's a function from some library, complain, then do something similar to the last example from the article, though it seems more complicated than it needs to be.",1249195690

737148,comment,735879,736197,0,0,startupcomment,,,"From the research that I have done, taxation of software sales varies from state to state and may depend on the form of delivery of the software.  From the states that I looked at, there was a greater likelihood of sales tax applicability if the software was of the ""off-the-shelf"" variety (not custom software), but if installed through a download rather than shipped, it was not subject to sales tax.  I agree with Scott - just call your state tax office and explain your situation.",1249194928

I cringe every time I hear it when the word ""use"" would suffice.<p>(I can accept its use as a noun in the financial context, because it means more than ""use"" in that sense.

737141,comment,736712,736908,0,0,redsymbol,,,"Re ignoring feature phones: Good point.  Making a  distinction between feature phones and smartphones gives us the choice to not support the former.  At least in the USA, it's probably rarely worth the effort.  (Don't know about other markets.)<p>Native is sometimes the way to go, for the reasons you mention.

I'd say that even goes for print... but whatever.<p>I spent a few hours reading old RFC's because of this whole thread.<p>It looks to me like rfc 1942 got popular, and the CSS folks never came to grips with that. CSS1 is pretty given the constraints of the day. I think about CSS in two terms (I don't think there's a standard for this, i just made them up) Formatting, setting fonts, colors and padding; and layout, i think old newspaper guys would call it paste up, where the big blocks go on the page.<p>CSS is great at formatting. It sucks at layout.<p>This was their approach to layout, <a href=""http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/Stylesheets/model.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/Stylesheets/model.html</a><p>Mosaic had support for tables five months before that, <a href=""http://www.eskimo.com/~bloo/indexdot/history/mosaic.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eskimo.com/~bloo/indexdot/history/mosaic.htm</a><p>They must have known, and i don't think they had a credible solution to layout problems. they weren't willing to make a full layout language, so tables won.",1249193968

Remember the two different baseline alignment models?); too many people seem to have forgotten all the tricks they had to learn to make those layouts work properly, and how complex the resulting HTML had to be.",1249193963

There is no clear distinction between contracts that stifle competition and contracts that are legitimate means of competing.<p>There are all sorts of exclusivity arrangements or vendors selling only their own branded wares or that of their partners in their own store. It's not like Apple invented this scheme. For a very long time telcos selected every single application that was allowed to run on their network.<p>Consumers have their own means of defending against such practices. They can simply stop buying iPhones for instance. It's not like there were no alternatives. As a consumer, in this case, I have to say don't need the government.",1249193870

That is a strange exception, and those people are hunters who eat a lot of meat anyway.<p>There are abundant written accounts of native north americans.  There were those who grew corn and squash, which means they have little in common with paleolithic humans who had no such crops.

Recursion as the primary mean of expressing procedure calling.<p>Does anyone know what that statement means?<p>The author misses the real essence of Lisp, which is that:<p>1) a single data structure, the heterogeneous list, can be used to express  everything in the language, including the program itself.<p>2) the linear nature of lists makes it easy to recurse on them, thereby enabling significant use of recursion as a control structure, thereby simplifying the reasoning process  about the code.<p>3) the simplicity and pervasiveness of the list structure makes it easy to write macros in the language, thereby increasing the range of abstractions that the language can express.<p>4) bindings are dynamic, increasing language flexibility and making the use of a REPL even more valuable.",1249192954

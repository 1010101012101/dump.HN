End of meal... time for dessert.  Your friends love you and, together, singe you the nicest rendition of 'Happy Birthday To You' you ever heard. Life is good.<p>This was an illegal performance.  Secret police comes in, puts your friends in prison (they stole & performed the song) and also you and everyone in the restaurant at that time go to prison as well because you got the song without paying the creators.<p>Of course, according to the New extended SuperSOPA law, the restaurant is closed down, and it's owner is sent to prison as well, because he should not have allowed all this to happen in the first place.<p>Do you really want to live in that Orwellian world?",1326545978

3464138,comment,3463426,3463426,3,0,buff-a,,,"""This is also why programmers who use typed functional languages frequently brag about their low bug count yet eschew methodologies like test driven development: tests pale in comparison to the power of actual models.""<p>I've written complex systems. Games. Graphics modelling tools. Network game engines. I've seen a lot of code.<p>I've never seen anything that complex written in a functional language.<p>Why?<p>My hunch is that models are powerful, but brittle: they don't stand up against constantly changing requirements. A great quote I read the other day was ""If it compiles, it works"". Great. Now change the requirements. The ""beauty"" of imperative languages is that they continue to compile and continue to provide some value of ""work"" even while they are morphing from one requirement set to the next. Functional languages are cast-iron. Imperative languages are steel.<p>UPDATE: I should also be clear: I think in models all the time. I just don't have to get it down perfectly on paper for the code to compile. I used to hear, back in the day, C++ programmers opining that we should all use C++ because object-oriented programming is superior. Regardless of whether or not OO is superior, they completely failed to comprehend how one could do object-oriented programming in assembly language, or that we'd been doing it the whole time.<p>So its entirely possible that there's something I dont get about functional programming that means I don't understand what I'm missing. But its also possible that I understand the theory <i>better than you</i> and so I don't see the distinction you are making because <i>there isn't one</i>. To discern which is true, however, I'm going to need concrete examples, not opinion pieces.",1326545875

Some laws, however, are too absurd to remain.<p>Piracy, for me is certainly not about not wanting to pay. It's about the feeling that the money I pay mostly doesn't go to creators, but to the companies in-between who doesn't deserve it. I don't want to support such an industry.<p>It also the fact that I want to push for legal alternatives which are as easy-to-use as piracy today. I want to press a link and have a 1080p DRM-free film download in minutes. The cost is not the issue.<p>I hope that, within 20 years, sharing will be legal. Just because it's written as illegal in the law today, it's not set in stone. Things can change, and for the sake of the creative people, I hope it does.",1326545641
3464133,comment,3464060,3464128,7,0,rbanffy,,,"There are a couple issues here.<p>The first one is whether copyright infringement as I think she was part of really hurts content producers. If someone is unwilling to pay a couple dollars for a movie in iTunes, you are not likely to buy the DVD either, thus, it's not a lost sale. If, OTOH, the work gets more exposure thanks to alternative distribution networks and that generates more customer engagement, the content producer wins in the end.<p>The second is whether books, movies, music and games whose primary purpose is to make a profit can be considered art. I think they can't. The primary purpose - and usefulness - of art is to transform the people who experience it. I don't think laws should protect the business model of selling art and experiences, but their usefulness.<p>A third question is whether it's even possible to prevent the duplication of digital goods. Most probably it isn't. Businesses must adapt to new realities - should typewriter makers be afforded the right to ban computer sales because they hurt the already established business?<p>Another one is whether they were turning in a profit. If they were, part of it belongs, rightfully, to the content producers.<p>Finally, there is her attitude towards law enforcement. I understand her frustration with what she considers unfair laws and processes. I am not sure her attitude is constructive and that sending her to jail was the best way to deal with it. If I were the judge, I'd like to lecture her about what she's doing that can be misinterpreted as threats. Jails are very tense environments and they don't need more agitation than they already have.",1326545613

3464130,comment,3461728,3463610,5,0,gbog,,,"I see what you mean. This is about very complex structures and interactions.<p>But in fact, I believe with enough time you can get used to any level complexity and find your way through it. It is a bit like a big city: however complex it is (intertwined roads, subways, highways, etc.), if you live there long enough, you will get a precise mental model. Same with software projects: after some time, abstraction will not be those foreign short lived unstable concretions that you hold in your head and that vanish away if someone says hello. They will be good old friends and the sole invocation of their name will instantly call a lot of solid knowledge to the bar.<p>So in this line, I'd say clever guys are just faster and more agile (maybe both are the same thing). Above a certain level of tolerance to abstract thinking, anyone can understand and work on big complex projects, given enough time.<p>There is another difference between good and great developers, though. It is the ""best path-finding skill"". For instance, given enough time, I would probably be able to write a Python script solving most sudokus, but I fear I wouldn't find as elegant and straightforward a path as Norvig's. <a href=""http://norvig.com/sudoku.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/sudoku.html</a>",1326545209

It's the kind of jingoistic bull that led to the Patriot Act and Homeland Security.<p>If someone told you the price for living in the most free society possible, is that 5,000 of your fellow citizens would die annually by terrorism, would that not be worth it? I would willingly risk my life, given the threat ratio, for that exchange. Particularly given the counter-terrorism efforts are already killing that many now.<p>If someone wants to blow their self up, or randomly stab you in the throat with a knife, the odds favor they're going to do it. You can try to prevent it, you can deal with the outcome, sometimes you'll succeed, sometimes you'll fail - what ultimately matters is that you don't fail big (nukes). That's it. You battle and deal with terrorism, you don't defeat it. You can't argue with irrationality or insanity, and someone somewhere is always going to be willing to commit terrorism.",1326542491

Paul Kocher, one of the designers of SSL3/TLS, told the NYTimes that he was astonished that anyone would rely on MD5 in 2008; is it possible that <i>nobody</i> at Thawte really understands how SSL and x509 works? If so, is it really an industry success story that they got included with IE?",1230670772

414666,comment,414330,414520,0,0,pelle,,,"I agree completely. Unfortunately the outcome is normally very different when the market has to route around it.<p>Rent control here in SF only affects people in older buildings. One of many unintended consequences of this is the ridiculous state of Tenderloin. Back in Denmark where I own an apartment, rent control forces me to only be able to rent it out as a corporate apartment to foreigners. The official rent would pay less than quarter of the mortgage. No wonder it is hard to find a good apartment in Copenhagen.<p>An example is the market response to the generations of social engineering started as the New Deal, which eventually led us to the very distorted issues we now see in the financial markets.<p>Another example are the costs of health care in the US, that were caused directly by the deductions for employers created in the 40s.<p>Instead of an efficient market, where people picked the most efficient insurance for their situation, it became an arms race of who could offer more benefits together with a bureaucracy to make sure their insured (who don't pay directly) don't abuse the system.<p>Let Richard Branson or any other smart entrepreneur at the health system without the handicap of social engineering and it would be fixed within a year. Rather than fixing it all signs at the moment point towards further regulation and thus further distortion.<p>The market will always route around social engineering no matter to what limits the regulators attempt to control it. The outcomes are rarely as good as if the market was just left to do its job. Of course when this happens like it has so obviously in the current crisis, people talk about it being the fault of the market run wild and want to bring in more regulation, when the regulation it self was what caused it to go wild in the first place.",1230670674

I would compare it to the Union winning the battle of Gettysburg, but then not taking the opportunity to chase the retreating Confederate army and finish off the Confederacy then and there. If Apple continues on like it has been over the next couple of years, once the economy gets back on track, they will be a dominant position such as they have not been since perhaps the days of the early Macintosh. So, no, I don't think Jobs should quit now. He should hang in there at least a few more years until the recession is over, and really leave Apple in a dominating position, if he wants to then retire. If he quits now, despite the iPhone's success, there are too many vultures out there for there to be a continued guarantee of market dominance. Macworld events aside, Jobs needs to stay at the helm for the good of Apple. The PC Wars may be over, but the phone wars are just beginning. Jobs needs to stay in there and give 'em hell.",1230670568

The capability architecture meant that programs did not run in a flat memory space, as we take for granted these days. Instead a program consisted of a number of memory objects, which in Flex could range in size from one integer, to the whole of physical memory. The memory objects are referred to by ""pointers"", and it is these pointers that are called capabilities. However capabilities were much more than just pointers. It is impossible to create (or forge) a capability without asking the system for a new object, and it is impossible to access memory that was not pointed to by one of the capabilities currently 'owned' by the program... ...In Flex, capabilities were visible in the user interface, and could be mixed freely with normal text stored in a ""text object"", or ""Edfile"".

I am not a libertarian and do not believe that all intervention is harmful, but disagree with your thesis that markets are able to route around governments.

We're talking about the impact of not revoking the certificates in question.  At which point there is a very very small possibility that I will be targeted by an active attacker with the know-how to exploit this issue.  The rest of the time SSL will continue to work as designed and will protect me from wifi snoopers and suspect routers.<p>There absolutely are passive attackers.  There are people running open wifi points that log http form submissions with a ""password"" field, and then try the same username/password on a few major sites (ebay, amazon, etrade, gmail, BoA, etc...) automatically (working on the assumption that people use the same login/password on the many non-ssl authed non-important sites as they do for their important accounts).

The brunt of all that is that Tesco is very good at finding patterns in sales, predicting what new products will take off (and in what areas), and when something will be popular.<p>From this, at least if you live in the UK, it's likely that Tesco has a better idea what you're going to buy when you walk into a supermarket than you do.",1230667984

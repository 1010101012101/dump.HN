1928958,comment,1928776,1928776,0,0,aspir,,,"In my opinion, you can't read a blog or a book to be able to sell, it just takes practice. But I'd recommended the following goal:<p>Introduce yourself to as many new people a day as possible, and do your best to remember their names. Selling is about relationships, and if you can't build them with strangers, you can't sell.<p>Everyone has a cool story and something they're passionate about. Find it. On a similar note, try to at least be able to hold a surface conversation over lots of topics and hobbies. It's not hard: golf/sports=""Tiger Woods is ..."", politics=""they're all windbags"", family=""kids are fun"". Discuss in that surface/shallow manner until something deeper comes up. You now may have something to spend hours talking about, and you may have laid the groundwork for a new close friendship.<p>That's touchy-feely, of course. But it works. For selling, take the above model and replace ""passion"" or ""hobby"" with ""career."" Ideally they should be similar. Relational bonding is how you sell things.<p>In fact you're not selling anything to anyone; two associates are solving each others problems. Think of it in that light, and you're on the right path.",1290408763

There are many ways of learning though, and if you want instruction and materials personalized to you, those are available -- albeit at a much higher cost. And there are other, self-directed methods of learning that are a much lower cost than either method (e.g., going to a library, doing research online, etc.). [Aside: who pays the cost is a separate issue, but someone must pay it.]<p>Given that society is constrained by scarce resources, I think that re-using tests is a perfectly reasonable allocation of resources for many teaching situations. Other materials are re-used regularly, such as textbooks, and there's nothing personal about that. Would you say that using the same textbook as someone else turns you into a ""widget""?<p>It's unfortunate that your educational experience was so unpleasant. My K-12 experience seemed quite wasteful as well. But I think that has more to do with incompetence and laziness. Doing more personalized teaching requires more teachers, which means they will have an even harder time attracting enough quality talent, and an even harder time firing bad teachers. That doesn't sound like a net win on quality to me, even if it is more personalized.",1290408746

That's it? Sweeping obviously does not apply to the actual trades since tens of millions of dollars involves a couple of seconds of trades.

(100% for elementary school teachers.)<p>1)  Providing value in a scalable fashion in SEO is hard, because Google has an incentive to make it hard.  If SEO were only as hard as AdWords, Google would lose billions of dollars.  Google considers virtually any repeatable process that improves rankings to be black hat.  I don't enjoy having to joust with a giant team of PhDs who have infinite budget.<p>2)  The SEO tools space is hard.  Small-scale website owners are often very skeptical that there is positive ROI in SEO.  (There is positive ROI in SEO.  Crikey, if you learn one thing from me this year, learn that.)  You have to do <i>huge</i> amounts of teaching to raise people to the point where they can begin to benefit from it.  That starts, literally, at ""What is a search engine?"", because most website owners <i>do not know</i>, especially in small business.<p>For marginally savvier website owners, like the average HNer, you can skip some of the teaching and proceed directly to ""I don't want to pay you money for this.""  You've been on the same HN I have for the last year, right?  We talk a good game about raising $50,000 each of a dozen angels and valuations in the tens of millions and whatnot, but what happens <i>every single time</i> someone suggests raising prices past, oh, $20 a month?<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1510986"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1510986</a>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1780348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1780348</a>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1357592"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1357592</a><p>SEO makes me thousands a month.  I'm not interested in selling it for less than many hundreds a month, <i>at the low end</i>.<p>3)  Enterprise sales is not my idea of fun.  Selling SEO to people who really would seriously benefit from it -- companies which do a lot of transactions online -- requires a high touch sales process.  I'm not incapable of that -- I do it for consulting -- but it isn't my passion in life, and it wouldn't scale easily without me building a sales force.  That requires a whole lot of skills (hiring, managing salesmen, showing up promptly at nine to an office somewhere, etc) that I don't have experience with, natural aptitude for, or any reason to suspect that I'd be really good at.<p>4)  What would it <i>do</i>, really?  (Your ""real"" question.)<p>Broadly speaking,<p>+ SEO analytics: Hard to demonstrate value.  Most obvious feature sets are well represented by free competitors.  Significant competition from SEO training providers who like to throw in a bag of tools subscriptions to make the $N00 a month fee look cheaper.<p>+ Tools which purport to ""do"" SEO for you: if it works Google will call it black hat, if it doesn't work it is snake oil.  I have seen an <i>awful</i> lot of snake oil.<p>+ Demand Media In A Box: Probably the best SEO tool I can think of writing -- automate topic selection and direct outsourced production of content for it.  Let's hypothetically pretend that I both was capable of and wanted to write this: what is my incentive to selling it to people who pay little money and need lots of handholding when instead I could point it at any problem domain I wanted and make a million dollars <i>each time</i>?<p>5)  What is the opportunity cost?<p>I'm pretty good at what I do: I make and sell software, and I do occasional consulting for other people who mostly make and sell software.  Consulting is fantastically lucrative, and would (and has) helped me get together enough money to launch any software/service I care to.<p>I picked out one I thought was a good bet, and am busy implementing it.

'borrowing' answers from other students on homework is a shortcut, but it's okay if the student understands the material in the end; cheating on an exam is not an okay shortcut.<p>""Surprisingly hard"" is the name of the game.  I mentioned that writing exams is hard to motivate why an instructor would use a test bank.  At a research school (I'm at a research focused school), being an instructor is only a small part of a professors (or grad students) job.  Using a test bank (from books/publishers or private ones) is considered to be fine, as it lets them focus more time on the things they ""should"" be doing.  Many things that are considered okay in this context are abhorred in others, e.g. having grad students be primary instructors is okay here but would be taboo at a teaching focused school.  Of course, most teaching focused schools don't have big grad programs.<p>Incidentally, I'm on track to graduate this year.

Person A knows X. Person B can profit if he were to learn X. Somehow, person A's knowledge gets to B, either directly or through some middle-man. B profits. Person A gets some sort of renumeration, perhaps directly, perhaps more indirectly.

You do want to get rid of low performers (and hire better replacements) and in a large enough pool the bottom 20% will really be worth replacing with better people.",1377381589

Computerised dispatching systems tell trucks where to go, even with human operators, and a human is probably a little better at driving than an automated truck. The gain is that the trucks no longer park for any reason other than maintenance, while humans have to stop to embark/disembark. And will frequently have, eg, a fatigue break during night shift.<p>If anything, supply/demand curve logic suggests there would be more trucks overall.",1377381510

That&#x27;s the part of the population without critical thinking skills or the desire to fact check things they read. If you&#x27;re selling a hairspray or something, being a bit dishonest is probably highly recommended.<p>The problem is these companies are trying to hire top notch talent - the 5% of the population that is least likely to be happy about dishonesty. Especially when it comes to a major decision like a new job. It&#x27;s simply a mistake and the marketing is unneeded - if you&#x27;re a YC company, the HN crowd has at least read your announcement in techcrunch and knows what you&#x27;re trying to do.",1377381507

6269935,comment,6269800,6269800,2,0,angersock,,,"I think that one of the most frustrating aspects of dealing with people (at least for myself, as I&#x27;m loathe to extend my experiences to others) is that they fail several key things:<p>People are not:<p>* linear time-invariant<p>* rational<p>* abstractable<p>By the first, I mean two things. People do not react proportionally to a change in input--raising your voice slightly or disagreeing somewhat harder may suddenly get you punched in the nose instead of just yelled back at somewhat more, or being even nicer to somebody may not return any change whatsoever. Moreover, the same input applied at a later time may completely change the reaction of a person--a harmless text message repeated at a later date could set a person off.<p>By the second, I mean that people simply do not follow a logical chain in most situation. Given a set of rules and inputs, you&#x27;d think that a person (and even their mental state) would behave predictably; this is obviously false if you&#x27;ve ever done business or sold to consumers or dated.<p>By the third (possibly the largest), I mean that people can&#x27;t be reasoned about at a high level. You simply <i>can&#x27;t</i> ignore or approximate all of the little minutiae that make up that person&#x27;s background, and if you try you&#x27;ll find that everything falls to pieces. &quot;Every girl likes compliments&quot; fails, &quot;every customer wants the cheapest goods&quot; fails, every abstraction falls over in contact with the enemy.<p>EDIT:<p>People seem to be reacting negatively to the opening statements of the article. When I read it, I interpreted it as the author trying to express the idea that even massively difficult technical problems are still amendable to standard problem-solving techniques, in implicit contrast to &quot;people problems&quot; which the author finds elusive.<p>A correct reading, I suggest, would be that the opening is more an attempt at example than braggadocio.",1377381281

I&#x27;m an Australian Mining Engineer, (co-incidentally employed by Rio Tinto, although obviously I&#x27;m no spokesperson and have no idea what the higher-ups are doing, or even blokes on other sites). While I don&#x27;t have any knowledge of the autonomous truck project, pensions & workman&#x27;s comp have basically nothing to do with it.<p>The mining industry in Australia is on the tail end of the biggest expansion in living memory, and it turns out it is near-impossible for love or money to move Australians out into the desert to work in mines.<p>It was not unreasonable to have trucks parked up because there simply was no human to drive them, and the salaries for a truck driver were in the $150,000+ Australian dollars, plus food, lodging and plane flights. This doesn&#x27;t represent a scary cost for a mining company - it represents a scary lack of worker supply. A parked truck is an unhappy truck.<p>In addition, we have very strict OH&S laws and the site mangers can be raked over the coals for the wierdest things. Eg, if I saw a light vehicle parked on non-level ground without wheel chocks, it would probably be escalated to the site Manager (not a pit supevisor, not the Manager of Mining, but the person responsible for the entire site) and  someone being sacked would be an option on the table. Getting rid of the humans is a huge benefit from a safety perspective, which we take very, very seriously.<p>Finally, automated trucks will provably do the right thing, all the time, without getting fatigued or taking breaks.

Elsewhere consult a fellow starter-upper and/or a corporate lawyer.<p>4) I&#x27;d build the product <i>after</i> finding the first customer, and I&#x27;d build it together with the first customer. I&#x27;d stay away from friends-and-family money at all costs. My friends-and-family are worth more to me than whatever money they can supply and the risk of failure is no different for this new fantastic idea than for any other.<p>6) Debatable. I work for quite a few venture capital companies and NDAs, while not the norm are definitely in play especially in the bigger deals.<p>7) I&#x27;d weigh those a bit more careful depending on where the centre of gravity lies. If someone contributes <i>just</i> an idea and won&#x27;t be doing any work an equal portion would not be on the table because it will become a deadweight in the long term.<p>9) depends. If the service is marketing then that would be up for discussion. Large amounts of leverage in marketing can be a big success factor and a partnership with a company with both eyeballs and experience can make life a lot easier. One way this is sometimes structured is through an investment part of which is then spent at the company doing the investment, other times it is an outright swap. Complex but workable.<p>10) only works for b2c. Not everybody builds apps.<p>11) contradicts 4.<p>12) strong disagree. If you feel that you&#x27;re selling yourself short then simply don&#x27;t. Venture capitalists telling you to take money at any valuation ...<p>15) no way. No deadweight, even if that brings business. Likely they&#x27;re just trying to offload their friend and you&#x27;ll end up with deadweight and you <i>still</i> don&#x27;t get the business or it turns out that it nets less than the friend costs. This doesn&#x27;t scale unless you fire the friend right after you do get the business (in case that happens...). Needless to say this is unethical.<p>16) stay in touch but not once per month, you&#x27;ve got better stuff to do than to re-visit all your rejects once every month. Selling starts at &#x27;no&#x27;, so do keep an eye out, they never leave the &#x27;prospect&#x27; bin.<p>20) do it, but if you can charge for it.<p>25) some sour grapes there.

Taxes are at some stage in your development unavoidable. If you are putting everything on red then not paying taxes can be a valid strategy, it can also be the fast track to bankruptcy. Adjust to your comfort level and don&#x27;t let VCs push you into making bad long term decisions, their goals are <i>not</i> aligned with yours.<p>35) Don&#x27;t. It complicates matters tremendously and opens you up to potential lawsuits and any move you make after that will be classed as favouritism with the rest of your crew. It also makes for a very uncomfortable atmosphere in case the relationship ever sours.<p>36) Employees should be fired if and when they don&#x27;t keep up their end of the employment arrangement or when you can predict you will run out of cash (this can be costly in and of itself!). If your employment agreement states you should not gossip then don&#x27;t, otherwise I don&#x27;t see how you could fire someone for that. Employees with an attitude are pretty common and those are often the best people.<p>41) then work like hell on getting your revenue more balanced. One customer that can sink you is a time-bomb waiting to happen.<p>44) do your homework and know your competition better than they know themselves. Know their weak points and their strong points, show how your attacks drive at their weak points and how your defences are taking care of their strong ones. This can be a lot of work. But don&#x27;t let yourself be taken for a ride by your competition, you are driving your own course.<p>45) Figure out what it is worth to the other party. The cost+ model is likely going to end low, especially if you are a dominant player and/or have a significant userbase or network effects in your offering.<p>47) that&#x27;s just sad.<p>48) this works if you run a lawyers office and in some b2b offerings. (I&#x27;m trying to imagine github charging extra for github pages or issues).<p>49) b2b only<p>52) only a little bit and only in the beginning. and make that clear.<p>56) debatable. Blog if it works for you, if it doesn&#x27;t cost you a lot of time you need to spend elsewhere and if you can do it as part of some strategy. Don&#x27;t just blog to blog.<p>57) strong disagree. Care about what you are netting and keep track of which sales are netting you money and which ones are losing. Get rid of the losing ones. Revenues are nice for a flip or a crash-and-burn strategy but at some point you&#x27;re going to run out of infused cash and you&#x27;ll have to stand on your own 2 feet.

This is not pseudo-science but a very serious discipline where very serious research is\nunderway worldwide that range from investigating the Casimir effect, finding new alternative sources of energy, and developing a means of future long-range space travel. Efforts are currently underway at a U.S. aerospace\ncorporation to include creating hardware to investigate using ZPE to provide energy.

However, the\namount of U.S. research dollars spent in this endeavor is abysmal such that even the simplest experiment cannot be performed.

This means less light, and also, as discussed elsewhere, a much wider minimum depth of field on the m4/3 lenses, due to the smaller sensor.  (I meant to say &#x27;fast wide-angle primes&#x27; in my original post, my mistake).<p>> Long working distance macro: Olympus 60mm f/2.8, working distance 7.5&quot; for 1:1 image<p>My understanding was that 7.5&quot; was the MFD (the distance from the film/sensor to the subject), not the MWD (the distance from the front element to the subject), on this lens, but I haven&#x27;t used it.  This review seems to suggest a working distance of 90mm (~3.5 inches) at 1:1, but it may also be wrong:<p><a href=""http://savazzi.freehostia.com/photography/olympus60mm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savazzi.freehostia.com/photography/olympus60mm.html</a><p>If it does have a working distance of 7.5&quot; at 1:1 that&#x27;s very respectable -- up there with a 150mm, and not far below a 180mm full-frame macro.<p>> Fast super-telephoto: 100-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Panasonic<p>Again, the focal lengths here are good, and it&#x27;s a zoom (try finding a 200-600mm zoom lens of any aperture for a full-frame camera), but the aperture is again a bit disappointing when compared to something like a 400mm f/2.8, both in terms of the amount of light it lets in and how shallow the depth of field is.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me -- there are a great range of lenses for both m4/3 and Sony NEX cameras, which cover the popular focal lengths and produce stunning results.  They&#x27;re also usually a <i>lot</i> cheaper (that Panasonic telephoto is around $600, vs. around $10,000 for a 400mm f/2.8 full-frame lens) and a lot lighter.  But if you&#x27;ve already spent $10,000 on a 400mm f/2.8 for your full-frame camera (and are making money from it), you&#x27;re probably going to want a lens that will give similar results before you go mirrorless, which I think was the author&#x27;s point.",1377380442

It doesn&#x27;t really matter which SLR you use, they all produce good images, but the glass is important.  I do postprocess my images.  In fact I usually shoot with postprocessing in mind.

What you view as a terrible film is often what millions of people enjoy. What you view as great cinema millions of others would find boring.<p>As an antidote most people I know do not share the same tastes as me (I find the 30s-50s as my golden age of cinema and love Humphrey Bogart) as I with them. While my wife can&#x27;t stand black and white movies (with a few exceptions) I also really dislike most modern romantic comedies (with a few exceptions such as Love Actually). Of course she says she enjoyed the black and white movie that I made. :)<p>This also holds true to television as well. I don&#x27;t want to keep up with the Kardashians or see which C-list celebrity has the best dance moves. Other people didn&#x27;t want to watch Rubicon or don&#x27;t want to watch Portland Timbers soccer. (I also think I&#x27;ll be much worse off with unbundling of cable channels as the niche channels are often included in packages with more popular channels and will likely die off without enough interest and pricing power to sustain the programming.)<p>John August, a screenwriter with a great blog and podcast and a geek at heart, has made the observation that talented writers are starting to prefer working with TV (channels such as HBO, Showtime, AMC, FX, etc.) as they&#x27;re given more latitude to tell their stories than they are in a feature length film for a studio. So, if you were to ask me for a prediction (and you didn&#x27;t), that is the way I imagine the industry going with Amazon, Netflix, etc. picking up some of those shows as well. Those, along with live sports, will continue to draw audiences as they provide topics of conversation for the majority of society. (Obviously you and your group of friends are too sophisticated for that and discuss philosophy and indie rock but you&#x27;re a small segment of society.)<p>You can never please everybody. And you&#x27;ll likely go broke trying.",1377378626

The lineup today no longer has SLRs they are all SLTs, with a fixed semi translucent mirror just for the phase-detected focusing system. The optical viewfinder was replaced by a screen fed from the sensor.<p>The (very well confirmed) rumors are that they will be doing away with the mirror completely, and going full mirrorless. Without the mirror there the extra space should allow for all kinds of fun adapters to other systems.<p>Their existing mirrorless sytem (NEX) is also moving fast. They are about to announce a SLR-shaped camera and the rumor is they will be moving NEX to full-frame and adding in-body antishake at the same time.<p>When it comes to high-end mirrorless Sony is the one to watch.",1377378583

A big part of the job for a software engineer is balancing abstraction with specificity.

My argument is that unless we&#x27;re shipping the &quot;big system&quot; on this release cycle, we should do what&#x27;s best for the small system. In all likelihood the system will never get big and by the time it does the requirements will change.

Is fetching one page for example independent of another one. If could be so it is concurrent, but it also might not be true, if it is a child page. You have to fetch one page, look at links and then fetch those pages. To the tasks have hard coded sequence so those are not concurrent.<p>* Parallelism is how that algorithm or problem is solved or executed. It could be that you can execute all concurrent units at the same time so you achieve parallelism, which is great. Or it could be that due to a particular architecture or other reasons you execute it serially. Maybe you just have a while loop and fetch one page, wait fetch another one. The problem is concurrent but it is not run in parallel.<p>Notice my definition doesn&#x27;t include CPU or IO in there. In real world there is both. CPU concurrency interleaved with IO concurrency. That you can then end up running none, one or both in parallel when you execute.",1377378009

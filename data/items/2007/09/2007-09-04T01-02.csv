Just do it yourself.<p>Other than that, it depends how you value your equity.

49835,comment,49787,49818,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Sure, there are qualitative arguments both ways in terms of trust.  It was just a conjecture.  I'm sure people have done quantitative research on this, and it probably varies by situation anyway, so it is probably not worth discussing further.<p>But that it is a different thing from off-site vs on-site.  I can pretty much guarantee the optimal checkout process (among the universe of checkout processes) would be an integrated solution minimizing the number of steps and abrupt transitions in the overall process.  Such an optimal process might include additional options for Google Checkout, PayPal, and others, i.e. third parties for those people who want that.<p>What it comes down to, is that for every step, there will be a drop off %.  Putting checkout on your site allows for less steps.  And it allows for more possibilities in look and feel, etc.  That is, it allows you to move more freely around the universe of checkout processes toward the optimal process for your particular situation.  <p>From experience, this universe of checkout processes can have vastly different outcomes in terms of sales.  By the way, I worked on another site that saw an immediate increase in sales from moving off Yahoo Store to an integrated checkout, and then another big increase when the checkout process was further optimized with, among other things, upselling and coupons right in the process.<p>I just don't understand the want to move this off-site when you have the capability to do it on-site.  I assume the main goal of this site is to sell stuff.  So I would imagine that you would at least want to experiment with one of the main things involved with selling stuff, i.e. the checkout process.  You could even run experiments testing off-site vs various on-site configurations.  I suppose I could see a compelling argument if it took months to create something functional.  But it is probably an order of magnitude shorter.",1188870761
49834,story,,,7,11,tony_wonder,"Equity for lawyers?",,"It seems that Silicon Valley attorneys typically work on a deferred basis, taking 1-2% equity for $10-20k legal work.  Does this type of fee structure work well?<p>I once remember reading somewhere (possibly by Paul Graham) that trading equity for legal work isn't ideal in many cases.<p>Additionally, what's the most cost-effective method for filing for a S-Corp/Delaware incorporation?  If I have existing incorporation documents, would I be able to go straight to Delaware authorities to apply for a business license?<p>Thanks in advance for the helpful insight.",1188870096

It's actually a good way to get your messaging about your startup sharpened to a finer point.  Having a very crisp, easy two sentence overview of your business is difficult but critical.",1188869471

So that's me/my project - if any startups want to talk about licensing schwag (I would love to include some YC companies), let me know (roddy at startupschwag dot com). If anyone wants to discuss the model I'd be happy to - it seems simple enough, but I'm always open to devil's advocate perspectives / refinements / flames. ",1188867732

Apparently it hasn't been updated for Leopard yet, but it will be along.<p>Another effortless way to get MySQL installed is to use MAMP, which also gives you an independent Apache with mod_php and some admin tools.<p>I wouldn't know whether or not Mark's catty complaint about automated MySQL security updates on the Mac is valid. I don't sweat MySQL security on my Mac, because it's just for development. I don't run public-facing Mac servers -- I run Linux servers, just like everybody else. MySQL is one of the few Linux killer apps, and it's developed on Linux; of <i>course</i> its support on Ubuntu is first-rate.\n",1194843006

A substantial minority of students fails in every \nintroductory programming course in every UK university. Despite heroic academic effort, the \nproportion has increased rather than decreased over the years. Despite a great deal of research \ninto teaching methods and student responses, we have no idea of the cause. \nIt has long been suspected that some people have a natural aptitude for programming, but \nuntil now there has been no psychological test which could detect it. Programming ability \nis not known to be correlated with age, with sex, or with educational attainment; nor has it \nbeen found to be correlated with any of the aptitudes measured in conventional 'intelligence' or \n'problem-solving-ability' tests. \nWe have found a test for programming aptitude, of which we give details. We can predict success \nor failure even before students have had any contact with any programming language with very \nhigh accuracy, and by testing with the same instrument after a few weeks of exposure, with \nextreme accuracy. We present experimental evidence to support our claim. We point out that \nprogramming teaching is useless for those who are bound to fail and pointless for those who are \ncertain to succeed. \n",1194842807

In that image, we're looking perpendicular to the axis of rotation.",1194840182

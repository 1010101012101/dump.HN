But my point remains that for 99% of developers we want a library that provides functionality (e.g. an ORM for a common database) and in that respect CPAN will only have an advantage for very obscure requirements.  And even then it still loses to Java.<p>The testing stuff is good and it's the direction everyone should be going but not having it obviously isn't too much of a problem because so few systems currently have it (CPAN was successful long before it had it as well).",1294746969

You don't think that people's preferences tell us anything?<p>It's irrelevant because it's an incredibly over-simplistic metric and it's subject to manipulation (i.e. everyone hearing 2nd and 3rd hand the US is the greatest country in the world, which in some ways it was some decades back and deciding to go there).<p>>American poor people are stereotypically obese and have multiple cars and big screen TVs.<p>Done with credit.

Can they get a hip replacement for ""free"" like they could in e.g. Sweden?  Why are cancer patients divorcing their spouses to ensure said spouse wont end up losing his/her retirement money paying medical costs of a dead person?<p>>Why is comparing the pressure between {your favorite western European country} and the US irrelevant?<p>Because it's impossible to quantify why this pressure is happening.  Is it because of coincidence?  Misinformation?  Informed choice?  Opportunity (e.g. ""we can walk to the US but can't afford to get to where we really want, and anywhere seems like it would be better than here"")?  Given that we can't say with even the slightest amount of confidence, this number is almost completely meaningless.<p>A number that would have more meaning would be if some place had no or negative immigration but that's not the case in any first world country as far as I'm aware.<p>>Huh? Opportunity is surely one factor in ""place to be"".<p>But it speaks to the location of the actor, not how good the country he's going to since he is choosing the new country over less than the whole set (i.e. if someone leaves mexico to go to the US that is more likely to mean that he/she chose to go the US over staying in mexico or going somewhere else in middle america than to mean that he chose it over France).",1294744826

I think because she is a successful driven professor she has upped the ante on this. So, in addition to what her mother considers successful she has added the cutthroat business and academic world of what is considered successful, then drummed that into her kids and got a book deal out of it.<p>As an immigrant from a caribbean island I see where she is coming from almost perfectly. Immigrants to the US aren't, in general, ditch diggers and gardeners. It requires a clean record, education, and motivation. Then when you arrive in the US the state isn't required to give you anything. From the moment you land, you and your family are basically on your own to find housing and work, though they do have local outreach programs to help in this. This survivorship mode carries on even when you are successful and especially when you have kids. My mom had few words for me, ""STUDY!"" and ""What did you learn today?"". ""I love you"", was reserved for birthdays and Christmas. Playing was reserved for weekends and summer breaks.<p>The one thing she did impart to me was motivation. At some point, when work demanded more from her, I had to be completely self-sufficient (or as much as a 10 year old could be). I was looking after my brother and sisters, studying, and running the household by myself (notice I haven't mentioned my father...long story). I enrolled in music courses, summer study courses, and enrolled at a magnet school. My mother stopped pushing me to excel and I started doing it on my own.<p>Now, I've moved to another country and started a family. And that same immigrant psychology of sink or swim has manifested in me. My son is only 3 but I'm pushing him to excel academically. I've said some of the same words to him that Chua has told her daughters (minus the verbal abuse). And I think at some point he will also be self sufficient, no angry mother or father leaning over his should to make sure he does his work or chores.<p>At the same time, the relationship I have with our mother is vastly different than what my brother and sisters have with her. I speak to her like a soldier speaks to an officer. They speak to her like a child to speaks to a mother.

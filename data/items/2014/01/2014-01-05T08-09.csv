At that point I had been playing guitar for about 7 years, and had somehow internalized key signature.<p>For me, it feels very calculated, although I didn&#x27;t begin doing it intentionally. I essentially compare a new song against an internal database of known songs. For instance, my reference song in B minor is &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. If I hear a new song that sounds like it&#x27;s in the same key, it must also be B minor. After I built up an internal collection for each key and practiced enough, it went from being a mechanical process to an intuitive one. It&#x27;s not perfect, though; most of the &quot;boring&quot; keys sound similar. That is, I have a lot of trouble distinguishing between C, G, and F - fewer accidentals means less &quot;color&quot;. In addition, keys within a fifth of each other can sound really similar since they&#x27;re only one accidental apart. I&#x27;ll often misidentify something in Bb minor as being in F minor, or something in E as being in B. Surprisingly though, half-step differences end up sounding very different. My wife and I watched Pitch Perfect recently, and during a scene where two women were singing &quot;Titanium&quot;, the fact that they were singing it in B minor rather than C minor was extremely apparent.",1388911997

I see a link with the peculiar &quot;bad taste&quot; of shanzhai: they do not care what &quot;good taste&quot; people think of pink Teddy bear shaped phones.<p>- I am living in China since 10 years, my wife is Chinese, my kids are half-Chinese, all my colleagues and many of my friends are Chinese. My comment was not &quot;subtly racial&quot;, it was (trying to be) ironically emphasising the fact that in some people&#x27;s disdain of shanzhai cheap gadgets, there is also the fact that those who build them are Chinese.<p>Just like 30 years ago saying a car was Japanese meant something cheap, copied, second-grade, right now the same applies to Chinese manufacturing.<p>And, in fact, often justifiably so! There are three kind of products quality made in China:<p>1) The very cheap that is sold in developping countries (have you ever seen those electric plugs with a single hair of copper inside for conductivity? cost nothing, burns after 10mn use).<p>2) The high quality sold to developed countries with Western brands. E.g. the Apple usb dongle in question here.<p>3) The medium quality sold internally and in developed countries as cheap alternatives to 2) above.<p>By the way, this 3) class is the most interesting because as the Chinese middle class raise its income level, it will have to become better and better, until a Chinese brand will do better than what is imitated currently (just as Japan did with cars, hifi, etc.).<p>I hear often that Chinese people cannot produce quality because of some of their &quot;cultural atavism&quot;, and I think this is very wrong. In the past, they were manufacturing the best of breed in many domains, and in all their region of influence having &quot;北京&quot; (Beijing) stamped on goods was enough to triple its price.",1388911752

You need an HTML star to pull that off.&quot;<p>Or a diligent resetter of expectations. And HTML star should be able to effectively argue against that sort of requirement. Otherwise, what are you paying him for? Markup monkeys are dime a dozen, and there&#x27;s an A List Apart Sliding Doors article those code monkeys can just follow.<p>I&#x27;d expect more from an HTML star than just knowing how we did rounded corners before border-radius. I&#x27;d expect leadership, and standing for correctness.<p>In both Yahoo and Amazon we succeeded in pushing back against rounded corners in browsers that don&#x27;t support border-radius.

The community support around Arduino is fantastic, and is a great way to get into hardware.<p>Although somewhat overpriced, the Arduino starter kits that you can get are a pretty good first step. I bought one a few years ago for about $90. The premium you pay is worth it, in my opinion, for the components, instructions, and sample projects that come with it. Starting with projects from a kit like this lets you get your feet wet, while picking up bits and pieces along the way. From there, you can branch out, make modifications to the code, buy new components, and start building your own projects.<p>More information about what kinds of things you are interested in would help in guiding you also, although I think Arduino is probably the best starting point in any case.",1388911197

Sampling is just another version of that.&quot;<p>This statement assumes they are not sampling other peoples music illegally. The law is based on the argument that if I sample so much as hiss from a record without consent that it is illegal. Why? The reasoning is that said hiss was recorded within a specific set of variables that can never be reproduced ever again in the exact same manner any time &#x27;within the known universe&#x27;.

What would you try to learn?<p>I would go for chess. The age when you start playing chess seriously seems to have a big effect on how strong you can get. If you want to reach world class strength, it seems you have to start when you are 8 or under. Wait until you are 10 or so, and your potential seems limited to strong GM.

7015046,comment,7014299,7014299,2,0,brudgers,,,"I first encountered it in high school. In the back of the class my friend Rich would read it during second year Algebra lectures - he&#x27;d sit under the light on the emergency circuit while the rest of the class was darkened so that the teacher could write on the overhead projector while monotonically lecturing for fifty minutes after lunch.<p>Before the images of Escher and fractals and recursion had a couple of decades to work their way into the background noise of common culture, GEB was mind blowing. Now, with high speed internet, cleverly written essays interconnecting ideas are much more common, and Escher&#x27;s black and white drawings feel less visually rich in a world saturated with computer graphics. The Bach still stands on its own, but the fact that the book can only talk about it and the reader is still on their own in so far as experiencing the music goes, and an appreciation for Bach is both the part of the book that took the longest to develop and the part which has stuck with me the longest...well maybe a skepticism of systems and general pessimism  derived from the possibility that Godel might be right has stuck with me longer.<p>Though Hofstadter might have become pretentious in the thirty-five odd years since he wrote the book, in its time, it certainly wasn&#x27;t pretentious - it was a risky literary exercise by an unknown author. It&#x27;s essentially Hofstadter splattering his young and brilliant mind onto the printed page - drawing connections between the principles and intermingling Pythonesque dialogs and treating the whole thing seriously is absurd. And wonderfully entertaining for the right readers.<p>That said, the most dated aspect of the book is the mindshare it has obtained. The idea that a book offering such deep technical engagement could achieve popular exposure in today&#x27;s world, borders on the unthinkable.<p>It&#x27;s not for everyone, and it certainly isn&#x27;t fundamental to computing and the world being more jaded and less stoned and more informed than the world of the Carter administration, calling <i>GEB</i> dated is a fair criticism.<p>Anyway, my recommendation is to pick up a copy from the library and see if you enjoy it.

Gates was unhappy in the letter because it was hard to make money charging license fees in arrears.  In my business, I charge for a lot of development up front.<p>The lesson I take away from this is that conventional software licensing, while it addresses a legitimate need in some areas of software (the need to diffuse development costs), means effectively not only shifting risk onto the developer but increasing it by orders of magnitude.  The sort of risk that one has from investing in a feature for an open source project is far less than the risk that a software house takes in building the next version, because they take on all risk, centralize it, and then hope to make it back through control.  This doesn&#x27;t reduce risk for the end user though by very much.",1388909021

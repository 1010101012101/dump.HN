1770961,comment,1770435,1770435,0,0,alexqgb,,,"This is such a ridiculously ridiculous post. I'm saying that having worked on a number of media campaigns for a small but excellent medical research charity that has benefited enormously from the technical progress made in the last few years.<p>That benefit comes from making savvy use of everything from (now) cheap digital cameras and video editing, to carefully cultivated email lists, dedicated web-pages for outreach teams, and growing profiles on social networking sites.<p>All that seems like basic stuff, I know, but that's what's so amazing. Five years ago it was either much more expensive, or nonexistent. Today, it's ubiquitous (Facebook, for example, had 1% of its current base in 2005, and today I can shoot a better picture with a $5k camera than a $75k camera could capture back then).<p>That massive and very sudden shift has allowed organizations to do things (real, saving lives and avoiding death things) that simply wouldn't be imaginable - let alone possible just a few years ago, at least not with the limited resources they had for outreach.<p>So, Jolie O'Dell, if you want to see homeless people getting help, stop waiting for 'tech to do it'. Instead, just go out and talk to some homeless people. You don't need an app for that. Nor, you'll find, do they. And when you <i>do</i> figure out what's most likely to help, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised at how helpful all these new resources can be - provided you're creative enough to use them imaginatively.<p>Separately - all of you working on this 'pointless' stuff; you're awesome. And thank you. You're making vital connections. You've helped tremendously. The world is a better place because of you. Please, by all means, carry on.",1286524192

I think what this means is that because of the pace of technology, we have things that go from an idea in someone's head into an ecosystem of businesses, applications and technologies in just a few years.  The ability to rapidly develop and share what we've built lets people fill in the gaps from deep meaningful, concepts like ""never lose track of your friends"" all the way to ""Mary gained 20 points on farmville today"" so quickly that it's hard not to mix them up as being one in the same.<p>I'd argue that this is similar to the car going from ""new sector of transportation, economy, and way of life"" all the way to ""now with rust-proof undercoating with 0 down, 0% APR and $1000 Cash back"", just much more quickly.

This is absolutely not a minor thing, it's life-altering.  Perhaps it's too early on in the process to understand that, but 10 or 20 years from now, everyone will get it when they look at who has been around and what they've shared as experiences.<p>Twitter is the global hive-mind.  It tracks what everyone in the world is thinking about, or at least it or its successor will when extends its reach that far.   Yes, most of that is shallow, because most of what most of us think about is shallow.  Duh.  That's sort of by definition if you think that through for five minutes.   If we were all deeper, then the norm would be redefined and we'd all seem shallow again.  Twitter succeeds at capturing the hive-mind specifically because it is so short.  Your immediate thoughts are immediate, they're bite sized.  The format matches the format of your thinking.   There's value in knowing what people are thinking, though of course that value will be applied in different ways.<p>Foursquare is a few things.  One, it's designed as a universal customer loyalty system on its primary level.  I suppose if you think commerce is of necessity shallow, you can dismiss this as meaningless.  Of course, it does give the small niche businesses a tool to level the playing field, but even that's probably not enough for some.  But what about this- it's also restoring a sense of place to urban and suburban environments.   There's a trackable history of who was where and when.  It's not as disjointed as it was, there's a throughline.  ""Oh"", you might say, ""Bob goes to the same coffee shop I do, but three hours later"".

It's all Schedule C expenses, of course, against your income -- make sure keep good records.<p>If you're doing an LLC and not planning on any future investors, Delaware isn't really critical, IMHO.  (Many investors want a C-corp in DE).<p>Finally, even though it's just ""paperwork"",I found having an LLC with a real EIN (and a phone number and FAX number and a real address), added some legitimacy that has been very useful in a few circumstances.<p>For example, health insurance for a one-man business (me) was cheaper for the same coverage than the ""direct"" plans for individuals.  But they wanted a bunch of proof, like my certificate/articles of incorporation in DE.  Go figure.",1240361472

Probably not the next project and probably not the one after that, but eventually I want to turn one of them into a company that I can work on full time.<p>There's a lot of great guidance out there on how to come up with a killer business idea. YC's ""Make something people want"" stands out among them. By adhering to that maxim alone you could probably do very well, but I feel like its missing something.<p>There recently was a discussion about a site called Parrot Secrets, which sells an eBook about raising and owning parrots. According to one site, the owner makes a few hundred thousand dollars a year from the site and he doesn't even own a parrot. He made something people want and has become very rich because of it. I don't want to start a site like that.<p>""But why not?"" I kept asking myself. Indeed, if the goal is to make money, there's a lot of easier ways to do it other than a Y Combinator-type startup.<p>I realized that I very much want to build a long term company. Something that I can still be running 20-30 years from now. Not some fish-widget-flashy-url-shortener-social-network-thingy.<p>My question boils down to this: <i>How do you identify an idea that has the potential to become a long term business?</i><p>I think the key is founding a company with a <i>vision</i> and not simply focusing on acquisition. Bonus question: How does YC feel about companies who say they are not interested in getting acquired?",1240359597

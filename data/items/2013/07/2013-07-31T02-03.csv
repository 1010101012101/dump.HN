Already this year will be sold more tablets than pcs.<p>This is why for microsoft was really important to get marketshare in the tablet market. Now they seriously risk to be stalled in step2 for a long time cause:<p>1 - no one is using winRT or willing to use it<p>2 - no one who is using win8 use mainly the metro ui or will to have a system in which that is the main ui<p>3 - for reason 1 and 2 the developers are not going to spend their time in making app for that ecosystem, preferring still win32 and the desktop/web functionalities or other os more strong in the tablet market (ios and android atm).<p>Also the fact that windows phone is using another group of libraries and the market is totally independent in relation of winRT is another problem.<p>It&#x27;s like for the first time microsoft failed each important decision they had to make",1375239595

6131652,comment,6129148,6131525,7,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sure, but I think he ends up missing the mark. Ultimately his talk boils down to &quot;let&#x27;s revolutionize programming!&quot; But as I said that ends up being fairly trite.<p>As for testing, integration, building, and refactoring I think it&#x27;s hugely mistaken to view them as &quot;symptoms of a problem&quot;. They are tools. And they aren&#x27;t just tools used to grapple with explosions of complexity, they are tools that very much help us keep complexity in check. To use an analogy, it&#x27;s not as though these development tools are like a hugely powerful locomotive that can drag whatever sorry piece of crap codebase you have out into the world regardless of its faults. Instead, they are tools that enable and <i>encourage</i> building better codebases, more componentized, more reliable, more understandable, etc.<p>Continuous integration techniques combined with robust unit and integration testing encourage developers to reduce their dependencies and the complexity of their code down as much as possible. They also help facilitate refactoring which makes reduction of complexity easier. And they actively discourage fragility, either at a component level or at a product/service level.<p>Without these tools there is a break in the feedback loop. Coders would just do whatever the fuck they wanted and try to smush it all together and then they&#x27;d spend the second 90% of development time (having already spent the first) stomping on everything until it builds and runs and sort of works. With more modern development processes coders feel the pain of fragile code because it means their tests fail. They feel the pain of spaghetti dependencies because they break the build too often. And they feel that pain much closer to the point of the act that caused it, so that they can fix it and learn their lesson at a much lower cost and hopefully without as much disruption of the work of others.<p>With any luck these tools will be even better in the future and will make it even easier to produce high quality code closer to the level of irreducible complexity of the project than is possible today.<p>These aren&#x27;t the only ways that programming will change for the better but they are examples which I think it&#x27;s easy for people to write off as not core to the process of programming.",1375239558

6131562,comment,6129148,6131279,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"> If you were to envision programming nirvana would it be mostly test coverage and scrum boards?<p>Far from it. Indeed I think that TDD is vastly over-used and often harmful and SCRUM is more often development poison than anything else. But the fact that these things are popular despite the frequent difficulty of implementing them correctly is, I think, indicative of two things. First, that there is something of serious and fundamental value there which has caused so many people to latch onto such ideas zealously, even without fully understanding where the value in such ideas comes from. And second, that due to their being distanced from the &quot;practice of programming&quot; they are more subject to misinterpretation and incorrect implementation (this is a hard problem in programming as even the fundamentals of object oriented design aren&#x27;t immune to such problems even though they tend to be baked into programming languages fairly deeply these days).<p>I think that unquestionably a routine build/test cycle is a massive aid to development quality. It doesn&#x27;t just facilitate keeping a shipping product on schedule it has lots of benefits that diffuse out to every aspect of development in an almost fractal fashion. For example, having a robust unit test suite vastly facilitates refactoring, which makes it easier to improve code quality, which makes it easier to maintain and modify code, which makes it easier to add or change features, and so forth. It&#x27;s a snowball effect. Similarly I think that unquestionably a source control system is a massive aid to development quality and the pace. That shouldn&#x27;t be a controversial statement today though it would have been a few decades ago. More so I think that unquestionably the branching and merging capabilities of advanced source control systems are a huge aid in producing software.<p>Development velocity has a lot of secondary and higher order effects that impact everything about the software project. It makes it easier to change directions during development, it lowers the overhead for every individual contributor, and so on. Projects with higher development velocity are more agile, they are able to respond to end-user feedback and test feedback and are more likely to produce a reliable product that represents something the end-users actually want without wasting a lot of developer time along the way.<p>Some people have tried to formalize such &quot;agile&quot; processes into very specific sets of guidelines but I think for the most part they&#x27;ve failed to do so successfully, and have instead created rules which serve a far too narrow niche of the programming landscape and are also in many cases too vague to be applied reliably. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that agility or increased development velocity in general are bad ideas, they are almost always hugely advantageous. But they need to be exercised with a great deal of thought and pragmatism.<p>Also, as to testing, it also suffers from the problem of being too distanced from the task of programming. There are many core problems in testing such as the fact that test code tends to be of lower quality than product code, the problems of untested or conflicting assumptions in test code (who tests the tests?), the difficulty of creating accurate mocks, and so on. These problems can, and should, be addressed but one of the reasons why they&#x27;ve been slow to be addressed is that testing is still seen as something that gets bolted onto a programming language, rather than something that is an integral part of coding.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve rambled too long I think, it&#x27;s a deep topic, but hopefully I&#x27;ve addressed some of your points.",1375238048

If it wasn&#x27;t for Office they could have fixed the settings that were missing in the Metro interface and the thing wouldn&#x27;t have felt slightly Jekyll & Hyde. Instead it looked more like the Office team didn&#x27;t believe in the product (or wasn&#x27;t given enough time) and it seemed half-assed.<p>I have a friend who has a 64gb RT and loves it, but he bought it for $50 after the original owner wanted to get rid of it.

If X and Y are at the top, and A and B are at the bottom, Twist A and Y, and the interconnection x in the middle goes away. But, you know, X is related to Y (same level in the sw stack), and I really wanted to represent them at the same level. Opps.<p>And, I&#x27;m sure you can see that all it takes is one additional complication, and you are at a point where you have crossed lines no matter what.<p>Textually there is no worry about layout, graphically, there is. I&#x27;ve seen engineers spend days and weeks just trying to get boxes lined up, moving things around endlessly as requirements change - you just spend an inordinate amount of time doing everything but engineering. You are drawing, and trying to make a pretty picture. And, that is not exactly wasted time. We all know people spend too much effort making PowerPoint &#x27;pretty&#x27;, and I am not talking about that. I mean that if the image is not readable then it is not usable, so you have to do protracted layout sessions.<p>Layout is NP-hard. Don&#x27;t make me do layout to write code.<p>tl;dr version - code is multi-dimensional, but not in a &#x27;layout&#x27; way. If you force me to do 2D layout you force me to work in an unnatural way that is unrelated to what I am actually trying to do. You haven&#x27;t relaxed the problem by 1 dimension by introducing layout, but multiplied the constraints like crazy (that&#x27;s a technical math term, I think!)<p>And then there is the information compression problem. Realistically how much can you display on a screen graphically. I argue far less than textually. I already do everything I can to maximize what I can see - scrolling involves a context switch I do not want to do. So, in {} languages I put the { on the same line as the expression &quot;if(){&quot; to save a line, and so on. Try a graphical UML display of a single class - you can generally only fit a few methods in, good luck with private data, and all bets are off if methods are more than 1-2 short words long. I love UML for a one time, high level view of an architecture, but for actually working in? Horrible, horrible, horrible. For example, I have a ton of tiny classes that do just 1 thing that get used everywhere. Do I represent that exactly once, and then everywhere else you have to remember that diagram? Do I copy it everywhere, and face editing hell if I change something? Do I have to reposition everything if I make a method name longer? Do I let the tool do the layout, and give me an unreadable mess? And so on. The bottom line is you comprehend better if you can see it all on one &quot;page&quot; - and graphical programming has always meant less information on that page. That&#x27;s a net loss in my book. (This was very hand-wavey; I&#x27;ve conflated class diagrams with graphical programming for exmaple - we&#x27;d both have to have access to a whiteboard to really sketch out all of the various issues).<p><i>Views</i> into 1D code is a different issue, which is what I think you are talking about with NoFlo (I&#x27;ve never seen it). If you can solve the layout problem you will be my hero, perhaps, so long as I can retain the textual representation that makes things like git, awk, sed, and so on so powerful. But I ask what is that going to buy me opposed to a typical IDE with solutions/projects/folders/files on a tab, a class browser in another tab, auto-complete and easy navigation (ctrl+right click to go to definition, and so on)? Can I &#x27;grep&#x27; all occurrences of a word (I may want to grep comments, this is not strictly a code search)?<p>Hope this all doesn&#x27;t come across as shooting you down or bickering, but I am passionate about this stuff, and I am guessing you are also. I&#x27;ve been promised the wonders of the next graphical revolution since the days of structured design, and to my way of thinking none of it has panned out. Not because of the resistance or stupidity of the unwashed masses, but because what we are doing does not inherently fit into 2D layout. There&#x27;s a huge impedance mismatch between the two which I assert (without proof) will never be fixed. Prove me wrong! (I say that nicely, with a smile)<p>Sorry for the length; I didn&#x27;t have time to make it shorter.",1375236732

PC makers had to basically ship DOS/Windows, killing off any hope that BeOS, OS/2, etc would gain any foothold.

6131450,comment,6131070,6131070,10,0,bhauer,,,"I use my Surface Pro nearly every day, so this sort of report makes me feel that:<p>a. I am an oddball (probably true).<p>b. Microsoft&#x27;s marketing for the Surface sucks (generally accepted as objectively true).<p>c. The Surface was a weak attempt (A subjective matter. I like mine, but there is lot of room for improvement. Ask me if you want more details).<p>The pundits have said their pieces, and I have written my own thoughts/rant about Microsoft&#x27;s current unenviable situation [1].  But as a user of a Surface Pro, I&#x27;ll offer up some of my random thoughts here as well.<p>Hardware-wise, the Surface Pro is one generation too early; it needs a Haswell CPU in order to provide user-friendly battery life and perhaps shed some weight.  To meet their launch timing objectives, Microsoft had no choice but to use Ivy Bridge.  As it was, the Pro was disturbingly late to market compared to the RT.  The RT&#x27;s flailing in the market muted the thunder of the Pro release.  The market&#x27;s response to the lackluster RT had already set in, casting a long shadow over the Pro.  When the Pro finally arrived, less technically-savvy consumers were already disinterested.  Even us tech folks were lukewarm despite the Pro being quite nice even if you use it as merely an ultrabook.<p>If Surface 2 is entirely Haswell (that is, both entry-level and Pro-level are low-TDP x86), and nothing else changes, I think the hardware will be just shy of superb.  As it is, the Surface Pro packs ultrabook performance in a tablet-like form factor.  Browsing the web, writing code, working with e-mails, Twitter, IM, IRC, the works--it&#x27;s all as fast and smooth as the workstation I have at the office (a first-generation i7).  It makes conventional tablets seem alarmingly slow and limited.<p>On the other hand, because the Pro is heavy and encumbered by a hungry CPU, it&#x27;s not as versatile as conventional tablets.<p>I think it is now evident to most that Windows RT should be unshackled.  Microsoft was apparently worried about cannibalism, but that worry is overshadowed by an utter dearth of sales.  Microsoft should strongly shun their baked-in culture of capriciously angering consumers.  They <i>know</i> arbitrary software limitations will upset consumers but they do it anyway.  Stop that.<p>Personally, my computing lifestyle is not especially amenable to &quot;computing device addition,&quot; and yet I half-reluctantly acquired a Surface Pro because I wanted portable computing capability and had never owned a high-end laptop.  My tablets left me wanting more, but laptops never quite fit my desires (too large, too low-DPI).  Plus, I am a bit of a Microsoft fanboy, I&#x27;ll admit it.<p>Rather than adding another computing device, I would prefer a model where all my applications run on a compute server I own and operate (my workstation at home would suffice), and all of my devices connect to views of those applications.  Adding a Surface Pro gives me yet another first-class computing device to manage.  So now I have all of the following devices in my life wanting me to manage applications, manage data, manage configuration, manage presence, manage and synchronize state: my home workstation, my office workstation, my media PC, my phone, my Surface Pro, and my other tablets.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to add another device to the pile with no change to the underlying model of working with devices.  I feel Microsoft is fairly uniquely positioned to present a unified computing model to users that Google and Apple seem reluctant to provide due to cloud stickiness (that is, a desire to solve application continuity and data continuity by moving applications to their public cloud rather than user-owned/managed applications).  Microsoft is chasing the Google and Apple model and so far they are failing.  As a Surface Pro owner, and Windows user on my workstation, I&#x27;d like to see Microsoft change course to provide a unified computing model focused on my devices working in a master-slave configuration over (tunneled) private networks.<p>Frankly, I want my Surface Pro to be a touch and keyboard-enabled, high-DPI, remote terminal to responsive (in the web-app sense of the word) application instances running on my workstation.  That way, it&#x27;s not a first-class computing device with all of the encumbering nags that entails.  I want a subservient tablet that is just one view, one set of input and output devices, for my singular computing.<p>Finally, as I included in the linked rant, I believe a massive problem for Microsoft is the insanity of MSDN pricing.  I strongly believe that their pricing model is actively hostile to developers, especially in this time of indie-oriented application development.  They may have all sorts of special business programs that provide exceptions to the standard pricing--I honestly don&#x27;t know--but the standard pricing stares you in the face and says, &quot;Go away, Windows development is not for you.&quot;  That sucks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft</a>",1375236153

Good advertising, on the other hand, can help a bad product sell. Just look at how much revenue the original Blair Witch Project generated. Microsoft created a mediocre product with the Surface RT. In a market crowded with absolutely excellent devices, there is simply no room left for mediocrity.<p>Furthermore, Microsoft didn&#x27;t only fail to illustrate the few redeeming qualities of the Surface to consumers, it didn&#x27;t even begin to try.

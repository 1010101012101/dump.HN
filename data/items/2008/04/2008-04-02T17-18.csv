This is how most companies do business -- brinksmanship is very useful for a CEO.<p>Why go looking for trouble when it's probably going to find you anyways?  Scribd offers a great service, it's fast, it's useful, and it's not really their fault that people abuse it, any more than it's the phone company's fault that individuals make obscene phone calls and pitch scams.<p>My suspicion is that they would be willing to deal with the copyright infringement stuff if they could do so without crippling their productivity.  As it stands, wait-for-notification is probably more cost-effective.<p>I worked at a large free-hosting website from 1998-2000.  We had a full-time staff of 12 people looking for copyright infringement and kiddie porn.  Anything less severe than that was simply not worth the trouble.

For some it's the experience, for some it's working at a startup, for some it's the money, for some it might be working on java.<p>Figure out what the individual want's, both long term and short term and if working at your company is a bridge to where that person want's to go.

Duty is a debt you owe to yourself to fulfill obligations you have assumed voluntarily. Paying that debt can entail anything from years of patient work to instant willingness to die. Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect.<p>But there is no reward at all for doing what other people expect of you, and to do so is not merely difficult, but impossible. It is easier to deal with a footpad [a thief] than it is to deal with a leech who wants “just a few minutes of your time, please - this won’t take long”… Time is your total capital, and the minutes of your life are painfully few. If you allow yourself to fall into the vice of agreeing to such requests, they quickly snowball to the point where these parasites will use up 100 percent of your time - and squawk for more!""",1207156031

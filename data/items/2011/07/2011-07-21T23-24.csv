Not being critical here, I don't know anything about your background.<p>For some people, they have a demonstrated level of competence which allows them to work on what ever they are passionate about. If that is combined with a modest disregard for money such that they work somewhere because they are passionate,  and for any salary as long as it meets some base level. If you want to hire them it is effectively impossible.<p>You have recruiters call them, they brush them off. You invite them to conferences and schmooze them with all the great things going on at BigCorp and they thank you politely for the invite and don't call back. You shower them with flattery, gifts, whatever and they persistently ignore you.<p>But if they get passionate about an idea and start a company around it and work day and night to breathe life in it, and more importantly take outside money, then BigCorp gets a chance. If BigCorp can convince the investor(s) to sell them the company they can move this thing you are passionate about into their company and have this star entrepreneur follow it.<p>Then there is a somewhat less sensational side, you've started a company and you've convinced people to invest, people who are now your friends, and it hasn't turned out quite the way you hoped it might. Perhaps the timing is off, or there was some gotcha you thought would be insignificant but turned out to be much more difficult, or maybe someone turned up a patent or something that makes your idea impossible to implement. Maybe its as simple as customers are willing to pay you what you need to make in order for you idea to be a viable business. You've got talent, you demonstrated an ability to execute, but your investors aren't going to come in on another round of funding because they, like you, no the concept as planned is dead.<p>You are friends with these folks (your investors) and you don't want to screw that up, so if BigCorp comes along and buys the company which pays off the investors, you get to keep your friendships intact, BigCorp gets to put some golden shackles on you for some period of time, and you get to try again after the shackles come off.<p>The short of it is that its rarely successful for a large corporation to 'poach' employees by luring them away with promises of better pay and more regular working hours.",1311292688

If you don't like the feature, dont use it.<p>That said, I think there are some possible areas of improvement:<p>1) I agree with the author that the ability to revoke a 30 day session would be excellent. If someone steals my laptop I'd like the option to force 2 factor on that device.<p>2) I'd like a Windows/Mac OS X authenticator token app. This exists for RSA, I'd like the same for Google. (bonus point for making it different than the token on my phone and allowing me to disable the software remotely)<p>3) Provide a way for application developers to register that they're the one using this particular one time password and then disallow the use of that password by any other app. (perhaps this could be achieved with OAuth?)<p>In general I like the Authenticator functionality, I think Google has put a lot of thought into it and I'd love to see them try and push for wider adoption.",1311289558

For example, you cannot change the master password, backup email account, or disable two-factor authentication using an app-specific password. So if one gets leaked somehow, you can always recover your account (though of course a lot of damage might have already been done).",1311289404

This is factually wrong: ""all they can do is read your mail."" As someone with Google two-factor auth and an iPhone, I can tell you it's not that sophisticated.<p>You can label the access key ""IMAP key,"" but that's just the human readable label. There is no functionality tying a key to particular Google services; any key unlocks them all. There <i>should</i> be such functionality, which was one of the points made in this (admittedly flawed) article.<p>For the record, you are right when you say they don't ""own"" you account, since they can't change the password. But they do have broad access.",1311289222

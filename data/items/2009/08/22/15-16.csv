Decent video production is hard to do, and takes a lot of time, but Google places relevant videos at the top of certain searches.  It's easier to get on the first page of a video search than it is on the first page of a regular Google search.<p>Blog, blog, blog, blog.  Google primarily indexes text for it's search.  The more fresh, well written, original content the better.  That being said, it will take months before you start to see that have a solid effect on your bottom line.<p>Find each and every single forum devoted to learning Chinese.  Become a member on those forums and interact heavily.  Build credibility on those sites by providing valuable interaction, and then feel free to post appropriate links to your software.  A lot of forums let you have a link to your site in your sig.  That can only help you in the long run. <i></i>* disclaimer <i></i>* I'm not suggesting spaming, I'm suggesting good, solid interaction.  Geeks don't really use them that often, but normal people use forums quite a bit, and Google loves to index forums.<p>Connections.  Email anyone and everyone that might be interested in your product.  Develop relationships with people interested in learning Chinese.  Find cross marketing opportunities.  Read some business and marketing books, take those ideas and run with them.<p>Become a sales expert.  Start reading books like crazy on sales and marketing.  Your technical co founders are going to be working like crazy to get the software side of things up and running.  Every idea that you can bring to the table is going to help them out, and make your product better.<p>Study usability like crazy.  A lot of times, technical people can get really wrapped up in making something work.  They can often get too close to the product to be able to see it objectively and relate to how a customer uses their product.  They need to know what problems the customers are having with their products, and what is confusing to them.  Help them do that.<p>Do usability studies.  Find friends and neighbors that have never used your product, and get screen captures of them using your product, and video their facial interactions with them using your product.  Meetup.com does this for every new iteration of their product.<p>Find new uses for Mechanical Turk with your product.  You can do some amazing things with Mechanical Turk and a little HTML knowledge.  Have Turkers test one or two specific aspects of your software, and get their feedback.  Pass that on to your engineers.  Manage A/B testing through Mechanical Turk.",1250956695

779378,story,,,152,78,gsaines,"Ask HN: What's a Non-Programmer to do?",,"My two business partners and I have been running our startup for about 14 months, we're ramen profitable, we have a small user base and we're growing steadily. (We've posted to YC a few times before, you can check out our website at www.skritter.com.) By all accounts things are looking very good for us, but we have a somewhat persistant problem that is hurting morale: simply put, I feel underutilized and we all three decided we should ask YC what other startups do about this situation.<p>To give you a little background, Nick, Scott and I were all three best friends in college. Nick and Scott were CS majors (among other majors) and I was an economics major. When we first started the business we all three decided together that we didn't want to seek venture capital or anything big, we wanted to raise as little money as possible, get to market, and then live (or die) off of the profit. We raised two rounds of philanthropic funding, one for $30k and one for $25k, it was literally free money.<p>After that the problems started. We didn't yet have any revenue and our service wasn't going to have high margins, so a lot of traditional marketing just wasn't going to have positive ROI (I know, I ran a LOT of numbers). I focused on doing some menial labor, and I also did a lot of design work, but even that wasn't a lot of work. At the same time I was having trouble feeling productive at 40 hours a week, Nick and Scott were working 60 hour weeks consistently and were still behind. To their credit, they were extraordinarily graceful about the problem, always downplaying the inequality in work, trying to find me new productive tasks and the like.<p>So here's my question: do other small startups have this problem? And if so, what have you done to mitigate the workload inequality and give the businesser meaningful stuff to work on? Put another way, if you're a three person startup or you have a full time business person or designer, how do they spend their time?",1250954385

I have never heard of a YC company starting earlier, especially since they haven't had the chance to review all the applications and potential candidates.<p>PG may make personal investments outside of YC, but then you lose access to the program. There are many other routes you can go for fund raising... Angels, normal VCs, bootstrap consulting or one of the other programs similar to YC. Those programs may fit your schedule and geographic location better.",1250954355

About how convenient they could be for reading not only books, but blogs, rss feeds, mail. How nice would it be if they could also work as gps navigators, if they could play some video and post to twitter. Now I know some of these devices already have these features, but how about having a platform (like iPhone) and an application store for it? Wouldn't it be great to open these devices for developers? Because, to think about it, I spend about 1-1,5 reading rss headers and blogs a day and it's really not that fun to sit in front of my desktop or notebook for that. I'd like something more mobile, but not as small as a cellphone. And, I assume, this could be one of the trends of the industry: we don't need to have these large shiny screens anymore for something as trivial as reading.",1250953503

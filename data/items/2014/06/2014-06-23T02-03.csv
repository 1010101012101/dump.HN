I&#x27;m just leaving it as is for now.]<p>> <i>Gregory Clark has an awesome book on this, The Son Also Rises.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t read Clark&#x27;s book personally. But a passage via SSC [1] (a link which I cited for you to follow and actually read):<p>> <i>efforts to democratise education and eliminate discrimination over the past century appear to have had no discernible effect on mobility</i><p>which is, uh, sort of better relates to the toppish-level discussion.<p>SSC cited how Georgia raffled off the land they stole from the Cherokee. The white lotto-winning descendants weren&#x27;t appreciably better off. This exemplifies how dynastic wealth can diminish because of a lack of some intangible value (work ethic? genes?), which incidentally Gen Y may not have inherited from Gen X and the Baby Boomers. I.e. I see no issues with my theory so far.<p>Also your Socrates quote is off point. The Greeks had this notion that civilization had descended from a Golden Age to a Silver Age, and from there a Bronze Age. They also believed civilization would continue to decline linearly. This is obviously silly since the Western World&#x27;s economy has appreciated a wazzilion fold since the Renaissance. But the point of the Chinese Proverb was more consistent with the &quot;Mandate of Heaven/Dynastic Cycle&quot; meme. I.e. dynastic wealth ebbs and flows like a business cycle. This idea is incompatible with neither dynastic long-term growth nor societal long-term growth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/26/compound-interest-is-the-least-powerful-force-in-the-universe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/26/compound-interest-is-th...</a>",1403491750

The lectures were basically him starting on the upper left of the board and continuing until he hit the lower right, some 90 minutes later.

When will people finally learn to read the spec and implement things based on the spec and test things based on the spec instead of just making up themselves what a URL is or what HTML is or what an email address is or what a MIME body is or ...<p>There are supposed URIs in that list that aren&#x27;t actually URIs, there are supposed non-URIs in that list that are actually URIs, and most of the candidate regexes obviously must have come from some creative minds and not from people who should be writing software. If you just make shit up instead of referring to what the spec says, you urgently should find yourself a new profession, this kind of crap has been hurting us long enough.<p>(Also, I do not just mean the numeric RFC1918 IPv4 URIs, which obviously are valid URIs but have been rejected intentionally nonetheless - even though that&#x27;s idiotic as well, of course, given that (a) nothing prevents anyone from putting those addresses in the DNS and (b) those are actually perfectly fine URIs that people use, and I don&#x27;t see why people should not want to shorten some class of the URIs that they use.)<p>By the way, the grammar in the RFC is machine readable, and it&#x27;s regular. So you can just write a script that transforms that grammar into a regex that is guaranteed to reflect exactly what the spec says.",1403490950

There are street signs inside it&#x27;s halls. John is deep inside the foundations of the building. John is part of that foundation, so it fits.<p>John knows. What? Well, just about nothing he&#x27;ll tell you. But it is a lie. John is part of the cadre of people that know what they do not know, and John knows it&#x27;s a lot. But that is the trick, John <i>knows</i> that he is a moron. This is because John has just about seen it all.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. On labtop centrifuges, the transformer for the high velocity motor sits right under the catch lid for liquids on most models. Not the best design, but if it fries, just about anyone will know. And pay. They cost a lot, as they need to be precise. So John repairs them for the UCLA researches that can&#x27;t be bothered. But there is a thing that John knows, because he&#x27;s part of the cadre.<p>If nitric acid, common in organic chemistry, drips on the transformer and fries it, something happens. John knows this because one day he was soldering on the PCB to repair the transformer and the whole ground trace went missing in about one second. John lost his eyebrows to find this out. Turns out, the nitric acid reacts with the various chemicals in the transformer and the PCB. The PCB gets eaten and becomes, well, a very good way of removing hair on your face. The whole board gets contaminated with a drop and you have to very very careful when soldering thereafter.<p>John knows this. Not really anyone else but who John talks to knows this. And since John is part of the cadre, not really anyone knows. But all the guys, and they are universally men, know. And they <i>care.</i><p>The cadre is full of the people the OP talks about. Large shirts holding in bellies of Tab and Fritos, heavy breathing, glasses, a lot of Weird Al and Dr. Demento trivia. These guys are insufferable at first. They couldn&#x27;t hold a girlfriend, let alone a wife, to save their lives. They know nothing of sports or chrome. Their lives are their work. The people upstairs from John are completely reliant on John, and they hate it. John isn&#x27;t unfriendly, in fact, hes a great guy.

The two hour commute and the craptastic deployment process are all you need to explain why you bailed after just a little while.<p>If there are financial reasons against quitting, or you don&#x27;t have enough cushion to quit right now, then reset expectations. Focus on sleep. Eat healthy and hearty, exercise, and if you aren&#x27;t well-rested, call in sick. Put your physical and mental health first, always.<p>It sounds like isolation, drudgery, and disappointment are ruling your life. A reset could help that.

But if you don&#x27;t have those requirements, you will often come out behind in rewriting all code rather than going with a green field.<p>It also depends on whether the work one is doing is cutting edge (lots of experimentation and learning required) or basic dev work over relatively well known concepts.",1403488802

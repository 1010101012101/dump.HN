Problem solved! No need to call the FTC. No need to have all nerds from Silicon Valley wasting their time on HackerNews, trying to figure out what percentage of relative size should be considered acceptable to be taken by the OS. No need for yet another discussion about Apple/MS/Google...<p>Everyone here is smart enough to know that there are tons of trade-offs when designing a product, and in this particular case the trade-off was ""yes, MS wants to have a full-blown OS on a mobile-oriented system, which usually require SSDs. SSDs consume less power, are faster, take less space, and the trade-off is <i>cost per gigabyte</i>.""<p>Marco <i>knows</i> that. He knows that MS will have to make one of the following choices:<p>- Save storage space. They could remove the rescue partition, but then you lose the ability to recover your system.<p>- Add more storage capacity. They could just offer a 128/256 SSDs. But then their costs go up, and then their base model would have to cost more.<p>- Use a different/slimmer OS. But then you can't run Windows apps anymore.<p>- Use a Hard-drive instead of a SSD. But then you'll have higher energy consumption, and it will be slower.<p>Of <i>all</i> of the design choices, the best one is obviously the one they took. <i>Unlike</i> iOS devices, the Surface Pro is extensible, so storage space is <i>not</i> at a premium.<p>I will repeat: Marco <i>knows all that</i>.

SoundCloud, for example, would just silently fail, and I would have to manually disable the feature to get it to play (in practice, I just loaded the URL in Chrome).<p>Since Firefox 18, this has been much better. Now, there is an area next to the address bar that you can use to enable content, even if there is nothing on the actual page that you can click [3].

4587497,comment,4585946,4586626,2,0,bjourne,,,"One important difference between how that completion works and zsh's is that zsh cycles between the available completions if you repeatedly type tab. E.g. if you have the files [less01.png, less02.png, less03.png] and type ""eog less<tab>"" in bash will show you the files. Press tab again and it will list the files again. In zsh, the second tab press would fill in ""less01.png"", then ""less02.png"" and so on.<p>It's a matter of preference which completion strategy is the best, yes. :) But for me I've found that zsh's way to do it saves me many more keystrokes than bash's way.",1348862358

No planetary magnetic field.<p>In short, scientists think there has to be a convecting, rotating, liquid metal core in order to create a substantial magnetosphere. Venus's planetary core is almost certainly missing one, two, or three of those things.<p>The fact that Venus is extremely hot on the surface (460C) is at least partially assisting with creating a ""stagnant lid"" tectonic regime where no heat-venting plate action is seen. So if the surface of the planet is nearly as hot as the mantle and the mantle is nearly as hot as the core, convection doesn't happen. Wiki ""geothermal gradient"" for more.<p>Thus no magnetosphere, thus no electromagnetic deflection of the sun's blast. Not a dealkiller, but certainly not preferable if you'd like to move in someday.",1348862344

This may increase your level of devotion and commitment if you return to school.<p>* By working in the field, you may acquire a better sense of which educational areas have value, and which don't need your attention.<p>* By working in the field, you will meet people with different degrees (and no degrees), and this may allow you some insight into which degrees have which prospects.<p>So my opinion is that working in the field has nothing but advantages. By the way, many colleges agree -- many of them recommend a ""work-sabbatical"" to give students some perspective on their educational choices.<p>> <i>Can work experience really count more than a degree?</i><p>Sometimes, yes. It depends on the individual. Count the people in the field who don't have a college degree:<p>Bill Gates, Paul Allen, cofounders of Microsoft.<p>Larry Page, one of the cofounders of Google.<p>Mark Zuckerberg, you know -- Facebook?<p>Larry Ellison, Oracle founder.<p>The list goes on.

Dain City is maybe 500 m off the centre rather than outright wrong as suggested in the list. Ayr comes back as ""8 George St, Kitchener ON N0B 1E0, Canada <+43.29177700,-80.45398100>"" - the coordinates and the postal code are correct, the street and city name are not - I don't know how to rank the correctness of such a result. Same deal with nearby St. Jacobs. Port Robinson is also described incorrectly but has the correct coordinates.<p>The answer for Burlington has first coordinates that are ""close"" (well within the city but not at centre/downtown/city hall), and the 'region' one is about 8 km off with a silly large error radius of 15 km. Ditto Kingston, Kitchener, and Markham. Similar deal with Clarington, Clarkson, Falconbridge, ""Sudbury"", and probably a bunch of others, though there's the added difficulty of Ontario municipal organization thrown in for those ones. Bizarrely, Ottawa's point result is perfect whereas the 'region' result is more than 20 km away with a specified radius of 55 km, but I'm not sure if that warrants a 'wrong' rating.<p>Echo Bay points to the body of water rather than the settlement around it, and I don't think it's fair to expect the search to know you meant the settlement specifically. Jordan Station is marked ""close"" but is in fact 500 km off. Wilno is marked ""close"" but is 10 km of forest away. The results for Mississauga are unreasonably far away from the centre of the city but within the limits.<p>Then there's search context - if you ask the service for ""Baltimore Ontario"" with no further context it might get it wrong, if you ask it from a device that knows it's at least in Ontario (or even New York or Michigan) it might work better.<p>It would also be useful to somehow quantify the results by search likelihood, popularity, community size, etc. A few names I recognize from the missing or wrong list are fairly small settlements. Scrolling through the list (currently on W), the largest results I saw that were flat out wrong so far are Belleville, which is about 10 km off, North Bay about 8 km off, Whitchurch-Stouffville about 6 km off, and Burlington/Kingston/Kitchener/Markham/Mississauga 'region' issues as mentioned above.",1348860852

I chose working in the industry over accepting the university place in Computer Science that I was offered. For added context: I'm a non-US citizen working in the US. The college offer was in my home country in Europe.<p>Fast forward 12 months and now I wonder how this decision will affect my long term employment prospects. While I would have work experience relevant to the positions for which I would like to potentially apply unless I change my course I will lack any quantification above a high school level on paper. I could see this being a possible disadvantage even in preliminary screening of applicants were I to apply for a job.<p>What I have seen of the tech industry would make me think that ability trumps your paperwork but I don't know how long that will last or whether I would be barred from working any higher up than simply being a developer. Would management positions be completely out of reach were I to continue? Can work experience really count more than a degree?<p>Any thoughts on this would really be appreciated as it's an issue that I have been pondering for quite some time. I figured HN would have a varied enough audience to be able to give good advice from all sides.<p>Thanks HN!",1348860802

Meanwhile, FCP 7 was yanked from the market at the exact same time - again, without warning - meaning (very) established users couldn't continue to rely on a very good system until the ""improved"" system was actually improved.<p>I remember seeing an extraordinary amount of dismissiveness on this very board from people with no media or post experience who were sneeringly characterizing editors and post-producers as neo-luddites who simply didn't understand technology (!) and who didn't want to change. The idea that Apple could have taken a big step backwards and tripped while doing so seemed like anathema. ""Clearly"" the fault must be with the users. ""You just have to adapt to what MUST be good for you"" came the refrain.<p>From the perspective of people who actually knew what they were doing, this came as insult added to injury. All the cloying remarks about Apple ""simply moving the cheese (to a better spot!)"" missed the real point, which is that Apple had made the cheese inedible then thrown it off a cliff. And they'd done so without warning, leaving a lot of heavy investments in equipment, media, and skills in the lurch.<p>Because it all this played out in a specialized niche, most people ignored it. Apple's chief competitors (Avid and Adobe) jumped on it, and life moved on - with Apple's once-sterling reputation in the professional post-production market forever dimmed.<p>Now that the same pattern is playing out with Maps. The big differences are (a) Maps are insanely mainstream - everybody notices this (b) Maps - unlike video editing - are absolutely central to mobile computing in general and (c) Mobile computing is clearly the future of not just Apple, but computing in general. So now there's a replay of the FCP X blowback, but this time, it's headline news worldwide. And the obvious response (switch to another system) isn't one Apple can afford having this many people make.<p>I have no idea what prompted this fiasco. Much of it may be external to Apple (e.g. a Google deal they couldn't live with). But judging from the reckless and completely unnecessary way they botched the FCP 7-X transition, I suspect something unique to Apple's culture is on display here.<p>It isn't pretty. But judging from the letter, Tim Cook seems to get it. They really Really REALLY need to get Maps right, and I really hope they do.

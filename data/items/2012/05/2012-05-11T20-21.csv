Brass tacks:<p>Some guy coded/paid to release this opensource project on his own time, and for free, you can easily copy it or change it in any way you see fit. His time is his own, he paid it into this project without asking anything in return, the second you start making complaints about him being lazy, or him not spending his time how YOU want him to spend it, especially when you NEVER EVEN TRY to contribute, you're acting like an asshole.<p>-----
Elaboration:<p>You seem to not understand this concept AT ALL. Let me give you an example. This example is not perfect, because within it there is actually MORE room for complaint, since the person in the story cannot contribute and fix the problem the way he could in the phonegap situation.<p>Pretend you are homeless, but have a functioning car and get an allotment of 24 gallons of gas per day.<p>A private person drops off a plate of free sandwiches, they made these sandwiches with their own time, using money they made from working in a coal mine at their real job, and the food is from their own stock, which they paid for. They put them out for all to eat for free in a heavily trafficked area and go home exhausted at the end of a long coal mining day.<p>But you live on the other side of town. So you complain about the person being lazy.<p>The person complaining is an asshole.<p>But! That person still has a more legitimate reasons to complain than you do, you have been given all the ingredients, they are literally stacked on a table right in front of you, there is one very easy (as you have said so many times) solution before you eat the sandwich. When you pick it off of the table, you have to turn it sideways before you can fit it in your mouth. You have personally done this yourself and managed to eat your sandwich, and yet you complain.<p>AND! Not only do you complain, but instead of very easily turning the table so EVERYBODY else with a sideways mouth can easily eat sandwiches, you stand off a few feet from the table eating your sandwich and shouting about how that free sandwich guy is such a lazy asshole.<p>-----
Summation:<p>You can always complain, feel free to do so, some people complain when it rains or when the sun shines. Just keep in mind that complaining in certain circumstances makes you an asshole. This is one of them.<p>-----
Longer missive. (I didn't put any time into making this clear or readable, readers beware):<p>You list all these things I am ignoring, I don't have to address every point you make. Do you feel your are entitled to my addressing every little point you make? By all means, complain about it, as clearly stated in my last post, you are free to do so, and you show quite the appetite for it.<p>I am addressing a specific instance where entitlement was displayed (coincidentally, your counterpoint about say ""but, but, talk about how much I liked Sass"", is one where you didn't encounter a problem. Of course I wouldn't expect you to demonstrate a sense of entitlement when stuff works.), and then I listed some actions you could have taken that would determine if your response to the hardship you faced was silly, that isn't changed based off of your other experiences or peripheral issues, nor do I assume that your attitude is perpetually silly and entitled, or that you are prone in all areas to displaying an entitled attitude.<p><i>if someone makes a tool that could easily be cross-platform and they choose not to then that's reason for complaint.</i><p>Seriously, do you even know how github works? If it is so easy to fix then fork the project or submit the pull request your damn self. For an opensource project, if it is ACTUALLY as easy to fix as you say, then complaining in this fashion is like complaining that your mom forgot to put mustard on your sandwich when you have a knife in hand and the jar of mustard is open in front of you. Sure, complain all you want, you have every reason to do so, shout to the heavens and whine, disparage your mother behind her back to the world at large. But seriously, don't be a baby, just take the time to dip your knife in the jar and spread some mustard, grow up.<p>Well (and this is said within the context of my prior post, and this specific project, meaning, you are allowed to complain to your hearts content, knock yourself out man) if it is as easy to fix as you espouse why haven't you submitted the pull request on this free, opensource project? This ease of ""fixing"" which you speak, combined with your lack of addressing it, combined with your complaint, provides the perspective that makes your complaint silly. In fact, the more valid your complaint (ease of fixing, etc.), the sillier your complaint becomes (unless you have submitted the pull request and are now complaining about inaction or something).<p><i>Your response to all that is that when I run my own site job I can be opinionated and exclusionary. But I'm complaining about other people being exclusionary and you find fault with it from me.</i><p>Either you didn't get the point I was making in the first place or you wrote this part really poorly, please provide clarification of what you thought I meant and why you used the word <i>BUT</i> you seem to be indicating the second sentence was dealing with the same point as the first sentence?<p><i>Then the do I have to pay to complain question. Also the linux community complaining to Adobe which I agree with. Again you ignore.</i><p>My whole post was an answer to that question! Also, the second sentence is just blame shifting ""but but, look at what other people are doing! Address that too!"". Let me quote myself, which has already addressed my opinion on both issues, if you had cared to read it:<p><i>I never said you can't or in some ""moral"" sense shouldn't complain, nor do you have to contribute, but as cathartic as your post may have been, that is all it is, complaining for the sake of complaining (feel free to try and shame or bitch about open source projects all you want, but when that is the first and only thing you do, you're being lame).</i><p>Clearly in the context of contributing, this means I think the ""best practices"" for complaint, and what makes a complaint lame or not-lame, is different for open and closed source, due to a persons opportunity to contribute.<p>I checked the pull requests on this project. Looks like for all the complaining you speak about (I will take your word for it), including your own, there isn't a single damn windows user who has actually submitted a pull request to fix the issue, nor from what I can tell has anyone forked the project and fixed it themselves. So it looks like this is a collective failure on the part of all developers (who are complaining) currently developing (using this project) in the Windows environment you mooching lamer (again, only within the context of this project and those who have complained, I don't know why I am writing a post this long, you clearly didn't read my last one (which was much shorter), or are unable to comprehend). Cry, bitch, moan, whine all you want, I am sure you can find the justification that this is reasonable behavior somewhere in your own mind, but that is who you are if you continue with this kind of behavior, and quite frankly I wouldn't want to support a community with my opensource project, that created and I work on using time that is COMPLETELY my own, when they complain without contributing.<p>Complain in your little corner all day long, I don't mind or care, I welcome it, because it makes it easy to identify your freeloading lameness. Super lame. When you have submitted the pull request to fix this ""easy"" problem you keep kvetching about, then you will be less lame.<p>Complain to your heart content. The fact remains: Submit the Pull request, otherwise, you are just an entitled leach complaining about an issue when you could be supplying an easy fix (You said it was easy right?). That is my final communication on this specific matter, if you want to continue the conversation submit the pull request with the easy fix first.",1336769872

3961340,comment,3960906,3961047,2,0,smithzvk,,,"Well, I think that there is something like the ink packet for bitcoins, or there could be.  I may be wrong (and please correct me if I am mistaken), but it is my understanding that every Bitcoin transaction is public (just peruse the block chain), it's just that they are transfered between possibly unknown parties.  You could track where those bitcoins went (the thief's account), and where that thief subsequently spent or laundered those bitcoins.  You can trace them as far as you like though they would quickly get combined with bitcoins that came from legal means and then you can only give lower and upper bounds on how many bitcoins are illegal in each wallet.<p>We could, as a society, decide that we will not accept bitcoins transfers from addresses that are reported to have taken any stolen bitcoins, whether directly implicated or implicated by violating the rule I just described.  We could also decide that the only way to get your address back into good standing is to, for instance, transfer whatever coins that could possibly be ill-gotten into a bitcoin sink (an account that everyone agrees to never accept transfers from, basically dead bitcoins).  You can even come up with more continuous proposals; not just illegal or legal, but rather you can have a 90% clean account, and it is clear how that translates to value of your bitcoins when dealing with people who won't accept illegal coins.<p>This is in many ways like an ink-packet.  That doesn't get the other person their bitcoins back, but it removes the financial incentive to steal.  Of course this is probably ripe for abuse.  It would definitely be a way to screw over whoever you were sending money too, but it wouldn't be a charge reversal.  You lose the money but the other party gets no spendable money.",1336769567

</code></pre>
It's funny you say that, because Git is the only version control system where working with branches, forks and merges in big projects is not only doable, but in 90% of the cases painless. You can't really appreciate Git until you've tried doing the same tasks in Perforce, SVN and CVS. No other similar software has the same painless approach to branching and merging, not even other distributed systems.<p>Also, its interface is hostile because it requires the user to understand a little about its internals. You may disagree that this is good design, however it gives you unprecedented control over the repository, which you need often when the shit hits the fan. Also, Git is freakishly fast and efficient. Much like C, an interface done with taste, but that doesn't appeal to those with weak hearts. And the fact that such projects as Linux are maintained with Git, projects which have a huge number of contributers, it's a true testament to Git's awesomeness.<p>And btw, considering how version control is one of the most important tools at your disposal, if not the most important in big teams, stop reading those SVN 2 Git tutorials and go read a freaking manual. It's worth it, because you'd be amazed at how much power it has under the hood.",1336768985

I know they aren't selling my data, or my privacy because I actually know what I am purchasing.  I am giving my money over to them for a service they offer.  ""Free, unlimited"" is just something that I have a few concerns with.  The first, would be that I have no idea how they make their money (probably advertisement?), but if not they are perhaps selling your data or privacy to third parties.  Of course, there is an option that it is run by someone with just so much money that they don't mind giving it all away for free.  But that is very rare.  The second concern I have is how long can a free and unlimited service stay up.  This is why I have moved my stuff out of Bitcasa after testing it, even though after an SSH I realized I had over 300 Terabytes to store items.  I just can't justify those sorts of things though in my own sense.  So yeah, I agree spidey-senses be a tinglin'.",1336768478

This will effectively remove a lot of the excuses that you might have had such as 'it wasn't me', 'I wasn't there' and 'I never meant to buy this', which were the most common excuses consumers would come up with after using a service for anywhere up to 6 months and then yanking back all 6 months worth of payments and saddling the merchants with the loss of income, pay-outs to affiliates already made and additional charge-back fees on top of that.<p>So even if the goal was a fairly noble one it looks as though the whole idea is predicated on one tiny little detail, which is that VBV is supposedly hack-proof, but in fact this is highly dependent on both your bank and the security of their implementation. Neither of those are as ironclad as they should be to remove all doubt.<p>But of course the banks/card companies are not willing to end up holding the bag if there is trouble so it falls to the consumer to prove that they really were not involved in the transaction and that is very hard.<p>On the positive side in this whole debate: Even if a consumer is defrauded there is always someone who benefits and following the money usually leads to the perp. That's why it is hard to order stuff online with credit cards that were not issued in the country that the person using them is from, that's why it is hard to spend your money on three different continents with the same credit card within a single day and so on.<p>Lots and lots of money goes in to early warning fraud detection (before the fraud happens) and this nips a very large percentage of potential fraud in the bud.",1336767444

I'm sure that hacking into any real bank would be quite lucrative to hackers, but their security is more difficult to penetrate. Yes, if a 'regular' bank was hacked and money was stolen, those stolen from would be reimbursed, whereas with bitcoins there is no chance of reimbursement, but the gain to the hackers would still be there. Bitcoin sites run by individuals are low-hanging fruit, but I wouldn't say they will 'never' gain mainstream use.

Could a 'safe' executable page allocator be created for just this purpose?<p>If the JIT'ing code is tricked into compiling and executing 'malicious' code, hasn't the operating environment - what libs the process can load, what syscalls it has access to, etc - already been security-hardened? My understanding of WinRT is that it's already a bit of a sand-boxed environment, with limited and measured access to the machine's resources.<p>If it's possible for the JIT'ed code to do something REALLY bad, like install a driver or write to arbitrary system files or something, then it was possible for the JIT'ing code to do that too, and that's almost certainly a really really bad thing.<p>Even if it's just a matter of the JIT'ed code violating the trust agreement between the user and the JIT'ing code (ie doing something that the user was OK with Firefox doing, like reading the address book, but doing it for malicious reasons), maybe a new trust agreement can be designed, that would make users aware that the JIT'ing program is inherently a bit more dangerous?<p>Or maybe what really needs to happen is we have to treat JIT's as pluggable, upgradable OS infrastructure, sort of like the image loader or dyld/ld-linux.so? In that case, if the Firefox would install a browser and the Firefox JIT'ter as separate components, and then Firefox would ask it's JIT'er to compile/execute javascript into a separate process - one with much more limited access to the machine?",1336766636

Instead, it's a voluntary measure whose implementation depends mainly on the advertising networks rather than the browser vendors.<p>So if we want DNT to have <i>any</i> effect, it must be something tracking companies will consider a meaningful signal of user preference.  The risk in enabling it by default (for a browser that will eventually be used by 20-30% of the web) is that tracking companies would increasingly ignore it -- even the ones who have pledged support for DNT in its current form as implemented by Firefox/Opera/Safari.",1339088375

People have  certain expectations for others, even in high tech.  The HS Diploma is one of those things.  The college diploma still has a lot of the same stigma, though it's weakening.   This stigma is a risk you'll have to weigh in your college or startup decision as well.<p>As for 'deeper in the stack', well, learning assembly in various guises is a good first step.  Understanding how the pieces fit together, and how to make things faster is the next.  I'm not sure if you're ready to start absorbing Knuth and the Art of Computer Programming (for reference, I'm not sure I am either), but that might be a good start too.<p>Oh, and another thing: understand the math.  Learn the math behind this computer stuff.  Understand how to measure the complexity and cost of a given algorithm.  Something that might help there is Project Euler.  It's something I enjoy hacking on when I have free time.<p><-- hopes my children learn to code like you have.",1339088342

HBO does not appear to have reacted to Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Justified, or Sons of Anarchy as existential threats to their business.<p>If Netflix is the threat that is going to motivate HBO to go direct to consumer, they're going to have to put their money and their execution where their mouth is first.

If you are a border control agent and you want to assess if a businessman coming through is a security threat, you don't ask him, ""Are you a security threat?""  No, you ask about his work and get into his conversation.  If he's honest and straightforward, you move on.  If you catch a discrepancy in his story or he is oddly defensive (as it sounds was the case here), you ask some more questions to figure out what is going on.<p>Personally, I enjoy talking about my work.

You have to automatically deploy new instances of your applications, distribute those instances according to the load on individual nodes of its clusters. Also, they have to do more or less the same with the datastore. If you have loads that experience sharp peaks, new instances will have to be spun up and that may take some time. Some seemingly random variations on response time are to be expected when you consider it's not only your application that's running there. You can somehow mitigate that by setting up warmup requests (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig#Warmup_Requests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/a...</a>) and tuning the minimum pending latency (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/performancesettings#Setting_the_Pending_Latency"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/pe...</a>).

The hypocrisy is... challenging""<p>So you see this border interrogation as part of a systematic policy to intimidate developers entering the United States with expertise in cryptographic dev? Gotta be honest, that seems like a wild and illogical extrapolation to me based on this anecdotal story. So the end game of the United States government is what exactly, in this effort? To keep people with cryptographic talent outside of the US?<p>1) Why? I presume your point is that the government is attempting in a very, very, very round-about way to stifle free speech? Please inform me if this is not your point, I don't want to put words in your mouth.<p>2) What would that accomplish. We live in an era of instant communication and transportation of software. Developers can work on products from anywhere in the globe. If this man was denied entry to the United States, what is stopping him from simply working for his company from abroad? The answer: nothing.<p>It would serve pretty much zero purpose to run a campaign of intimidation against an incredibly small subset of the developer population... Programmers with cryptographic expertise who frequently travel in and outside of the United States... I don't get it. What about all of those with crypto experience who are already in the US and don't travel. Aren't they a threat? Are they being targeted? Where are their stories?<p>Doesn't the government, when they are looking to either break or make these same crypto software, draw from the same talent pool as private industry here in America? Why would they run that talent out of town?<p>If the US government wanted to suppress cryptographic research or otherwise circumvent it in an effort to subvert Free Speech, don't you think there are more precise and non-haphazard-and-idiotic ways of doing it?<p>This goes against the general sentiment of comments I've seen in this article, but I just have to say it. I think the idea is ridiculous and above all, completely inefficient for the goals everyone is ascribing to the border agents and the government here.<p>Logic doesn't really back this up. I can't imagine the point of this. I am not naive enough to think the government doesn't do some shady stuff, but I simply don't see the point and don't see this as an effective tool in whatever their war on developers is supposed to be.",1339087492

Krugman-cum-commentator occasionally contradicts Krugman-cum-economist. For example, [1]<p>2. Krugman falls into the same trap as most economic commentators, in assuming that one side of the Keynes/Hayek divide has been proven right (which side depends on the commentator in question), refusing to acknowledge the lack of predictive success that the entire spectrum of macroeconomics suffers from. The truth of the matter is that neither side should consider the debate won, since both haven't achieved the scientific holy grail: to be able to reliably predict what will happen, given the inputs. And since this is the case, they ought to be a little more humble in their assertions.<p>3. The role of economics is to help us understand choices. It cannot tell us what choices are correct, only how they compare. Making policy requires that we overlay some value system to weigh those choices. Yet Krugman (and others) continue to overlook this part of it, and simply assuming the values, acting as if policy follows directly.<p>4. It's false that the GOP has embraced the Austrian model. Both the GOP and DEM are corporatist, and love regulation -- just of somewhat different sorts. Despite their rhetoric, except at the fringes, the GOP does not actually follow Austrian, Chicago, or any free-market ideology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/01/krugman-v-krugman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/01/kru...</a><p>EDIT: full disclosure: I'm frequently guilty of #2 myself.<p>EDIT 2: change ""frequently"" to ""occasionally""; don't want to be too hyperbolic.",1339086975

If they were renegotiated at any point in the last five or so years, I would think it likely that such clauses exist.  Perhaps not with every provider, but with enough to make things problematic prior to the next round of re-negotiations.<p>e.g. 
Suppose something in the contract indicates that Comcast only kicks back to HBO a fraction of the cheapest available consumer-facing price. (Protecting Comcast from HBO's turning around and cutting a sweetheart deal with another cable operator the next day)<p>In which case HBO's $10 cut of the $17ish that Comcast charges [1] would itself erode should HBO make a hypothetical $12/mo offering available.<p>So even if HBO's cable subscriber numbers held steady, they may well be facing a huge drop in revenue simply by making an economically-feasible direct-to-consumer offering. [2]<p>Or, it could be a more direct clause simply prevents any direct-to-consumer offering.<p>But that situation sounds the most likely to me.  It would have been in the cable operators interests to ask for such clauses and in HBO's interests to concede. [3]<p>[1] Numbers based solely on prior articles I've read. I haven't had cable, let alone HBO, in quite some time.<p>[2] I think we can all agree that even HBO would be dead-in-the-water among cord-cutters at anything north of $15/mo. And anything between 10 and 15 gets debatable.<p>[3] Even three years ago streaming was not 'ready' to the point of justifying a fight with cable operators.  Even now it's anything but a sure thing.  Particularly when there hasn't been a real break-out leader in the IP-set-top-box space.  They'd need to sign and support a half-dozen deals and platforms to give this thing an honest shot at the moment.

That's what I was responding to.]<p>I agree completely that businesses must act in an ethical way. However, I don't feel that Dow was unethical. The wiki pages on this are very one sided, making it appear an open and shut case. Dow disagrees, and I've heard that from toxicologists that I knew and respected personally.<p>To quote from 
<a href=""http://www.dow.com/sustainability/debates/agentorange/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dow.com/sustainability/debates/agentorange/</a><p>____________________<p>Agent Orange<p>The jungles of South Vietnam were ideally suited for providing enemy cover for the guerilla tactics employed by troops battling South Vietnamese, American, and other allied forces during the Vietnam War. To offset ambush attacks and protect allied forces, the U.S. military sought to defoliate combat areas by developing and using the herbicide Agent Orange. U.S. military research developed Agent Orange, and the product was formulated based on exacting military specifications.<p>Companies supplying Agent Orange to the government included The Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto Company, Hercules Inc., Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company, Uniroyal Inc., Thompson Chemical and T-H Agriculture and Nutrition Company.<p>Public concern over Agent Orange has centered not over the product itself, but an unavoidable by-product that was present in only trace levels of one of the product's ingredients. The unavoidable trace by-product was the dioxin compound 2,3,7,8-TCDD.<p>Dow's Position<p>As a nation at war, the U.S. government compelled a number of companies to produce Agent Orange under the Defense Production Act. The government specified how it would be produced and controlled its use.<p>The scientific investigation on Agent Orange has gone on since the Vietnam War and continues today. There have been extensive epidemiological studies of those veterans most exposed to Agent Orange. Today, the scientific consensus is that when the collective human evidence is reviewed, it doesn't show that Agent Orange caused veteran's illnesses.<p>___________________<p>You are of course free to disagree with me, and Dow. However, this is such a political topic it boggles my mind we are discussing this on Hacker News. So how do you feel about Mitt Romney's chances, while we're at it?",1339085195

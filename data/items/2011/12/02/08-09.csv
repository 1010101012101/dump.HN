Most videos are in M4V format. However, the M4V videos from iTunes, are DRM protected. That means you cannot put the M4V videos to non-Apple devices. If you want to play the videos on other players like Archos, Zen, etc., you need to remove iTunes DRM from M4V and convert iTunes M4V to other video formats like WMV, MP4, AVI, etc. so that you can enjoy those iTunes M4V videos without any limitation.Well, to remove DRM M4V, you must choose a reliable third part DRM removal software which can legally remove DRM protections from M4V videos. Here we highly recommend Aimersoft DRM Media Converter, a fast and handy DRM removal to help you get rid of the M4V protection and convert the M4V videos to any video and audio formats like WMV, MP4, AVI, MP3, etc.",1322816365

It's false. Well ... it might be false. Extrinsic rewards ($10) tend to displace intrinsic rewards (I saved someone's life!).<p>If the reward is high enough, you will certainly get lots of donors. But if the reward is too high, poor people may get shut out.<p>Because of the intrinsic reward, it might be better if blood was donated. I'm not so sure about bone marrow though - if there's enough of a shortage (due to it being much harder to donate than blood), then it might be worth it. Poor people won't be able to afford it (or will be really screwed by the costs), but at least some people will get it. And donors won't feel the warm glow of having saved a life, but they will feel the warmer glow of a big fat cheque (as I'm assuming the extrinsic reward will be higher than the intrinsic reward it displaced).<p>As for organs, you could end the shortage now if you mailed out donation forms, and said that anyone who didn't sign on as a donor (after they don't need the bits, of course) would be shunted to the bottom of the list if they needed one later on.",1322815298

If you find yourself doubting this happens, do this: ask ten women you know if they had ever negotiated for something, and what happened when they did. Then draw your own conclusions.<p>I never negotiated for something work-related, and I'm a man, I've been in the workforce for the last 10 years. My wife negotiates all the time, she works in procurement, it is her job.

The instructor was a female nazi-like drill sergeant type.  They were expected to practice yelling in people's faces and being super pushy and the like.  One day when it came her turn in class to yell at people and all that, the author of the piece said ""No, I don't really want to do that.  I like being nice to people.""  She was berated and told how she had no hope of getting anywhere in the world and so on. She continued to politely decline. The instructor finally gave up and moved on.  The author quietly gathered her things and left the class, deciding she didn't want to complete the course.  As she left, she overheard someone in the back row (who was dutifully waiting their turn to yell at people as they were told to) say ""God, what a bitch!""<p>Don't confuse style vs substance.",1322813748

Five hundred years ago, women were barely better off than slaves. A hundred years ago, they couldn't vote. Fifty years ago, it was still considered impolite for them to have strong political views. Now, they are subtly discriminated against by men in a variety of contexts, but probably less so than at any time before in history. Fifty years from now, if we keep working on it, it'll probably be less. But I have trouble visualizing a model of the human brain where all of that discriminatory behavior is learned.

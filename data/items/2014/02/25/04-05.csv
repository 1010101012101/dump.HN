That requires a slower speed than I could read a simple novel (800+ wpm), but still much faster than I could read it in paper (under 300 wpm).<p>This took practice. I was reading economics books by Mises at 300 wpm in spreeder for a while and gradually increased the speed. I kept the speed low enough to understand it. However, it was never worse than regular reading.<p>Also, I started with 3 word chunks. I found that a lot easier than 1 word chunks.

I was pointing out that just because our laws against these crimes do not stop every instance, there is no reason to abolish the law itself.<p>You&#x27;re talking about things which have a wide variety of perfectly legitimate uses which we (quite properly) allow in spite of the fact that they can, on occasion, be used to harm. This is obviously and substantially different.<p>Indeed, when you think about it, these very different things are nevertheless complementary. We allow potentially dangerous things to exist because we&#x27;re (reasonably) well-assured that any truly harmful applications can be dealt with using the laws we reserve for handling grievous harms.<p>Regarding the &quot;example&quot; you brought up, the difference between robbery and pot is that pot is actually quite popular and the war against it is being waged with profound incompetence and for reasons that are increasingly suspect. Robbery, on the other hand, is - and remains - widely unwelcome in nearly any setting, even among thieves.<p>I&#x27;ll do you the favor of assuming you&#x27;re actually intelligent enough to grasp all this and that you&#x27;re simply trolling.

As someone who speed-reads regularly, I find that reading three words at a time works much better than one word, especially w.r.t. retaining context.<p>It also seems to matter whether chunks are split around punctuation or not, i.e. If the sentence is about to end after two words, the current chunk should not show the first word of the next sentence, just show the last two words of the current sentence. I couldn&#x27;t find a speed-reading app that did this the way I wanted, so I wrote one for iOS (<a href=""http://velocireaderapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://velocireaderapp.com/</a>)<p>I also agree with the comment below that dense texts are best read without speed-reading. There&#x27;s a sweet spot between easy and hard, boring and fun for texts that are ideal for speed-reading IMO.",1393301013

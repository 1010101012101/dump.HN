5807110,comment,5806132,5806817,4,0,gizmo686,,,">greater negative liberty\nWhat does this mean?<p>>We could even make a requirement that individuals remain in the work force (even if they can't find an employer willing to hire them at this time): they would provide proof that they've applied to jobs, were seeking further education, or the like.<p>I've long been a supporter of a negative income tax (actually, until recently it was a basic income), and this is one idea I've been trying to develop. I have some concerns about how well the idea you layed out could be implemented. It seems like it is doomed to fail due to the nessasary bueracracy. Either the process of proving you were looking for work becomes so streamline that you do not need to actually exert meaningfull effort (and possibly waste employers time to get the needed paperwork), or proving that you are seeking work would become a significant burden.<p>The solution I've been thinking of is some sort of work on demand program, where, while your unemployed and reiciving your guaranteed income, you can be asked to do short term work for the government (and/or private companies). Obviously this would need regulation to prevent it from being exploitative, but it would allow the governent to make more infastructure investments without needing nearly as much money. It might even save more money than we are paying people through the program as we would effectivly be getting labor at below market wages. An important part of this system is that there be no long term commitment, so if you find a job, want to move, etc, you will not be prevented from doing so. This may also require an additional investment in training the unemployed to do the specific job we need them to (but training the workforce is a good idea anyway).<p>Apart from the obvious regulatory issues, which seem solvable, what I can't quite figure out is how to make this fit in with a negative income tax. Effectivly the work on demand model makes the government an employer of last resort, and what would be negative income tax simply becomes a paycheck. The best solution I can come up with is abandon the negative income tax idea and embrace the government as an employer of last resort model. This sidesteps the problem of a lazy unemployed by requiring them to work to receive the income. If the 'normal' workforce gets to small employers could 'rent' these workers from the government, again at sub-market wages.<p>This however, risks employers not hiring 'normal' workers, but rather work on demand`ers. If this is the case, then many people would be unable to get a normal job, and effectivly be forced to work for sub-market wages, potentially leading to a situation like the industrial revolution where much of the workforce is trapped in low paying jobs because they are the only ones available.<p>However, because the government controls the minimum income, they  control the wages of these workers, so they can increase said wages as this starts to become the case. But, as this happens we move even more into the government become the sole employer. Once this happens we begin to loose the free market, causing us to be in an effectivly socialist state. However, when a specific region of this economy becomes inneficient, an entrapanuer would have the oppurtunity to make above minimum wages by competing with the existing provider. If quality of life is good enough for everyone that no one wants to do this, then we win. If quality of life is bad enough then someone will do this. Hopefully this will allow the free market to create and maintain the proper equilibrium point between socialism and free-market.",1370141771

5807106,comment,5805460,5805460,32,0,cromwellian,,,"Should be titled the Banality of Google Strawmen for the often repeated conspiracy theories of Google working with the NSA.<p>Assange, who was on the cypherpunks list (as I was in the late 80s/early 90s), should know better when he writes something like ""The advance of information technology epitomized by Google heralds the death of privacy for most people and shifts the world toward authoritarianism. This is the principal thesis in my book, 'Cypherpunks.'""<p>He clearly was present for the Clipper chip fiasco which showed the state's fears over cryptography in the hands of private citizens, and the central tenet of cypherpunks was a belief that modern, unbreakable, cryptography could defang the state's ability to invade privacy. Back then, the big debate among 'punks was stuff like untraceable assassination markets using BitCoin-like distributed money in which police and the state were powerless. Anarcho-capitalists were salivating over how in the future people would be able to share and communicate with no intervention.<p>Point being, if you want privacy guarantees, truly want certainty, the technology exists to secure it. He was in fact, part of a movement aimed at providing the software to do it and make it easier for the average person. His experience on WikiLeaks shows how one can keep secrets from the state, even the US Government.<p>How one goes from the idea that cryptography presents the opportunity for undefeatable privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, etc no matter how much the state is against it, to, voluntary use of Google is the death of privacy, I don't get.<p>Now, I never believed that cryptography alone could overcome the state, but a lot of cypherpunks did. But there was a huge intersection between cypherpunks and libertarians, who would take the view that people have the right to trade their personal information and that there is nothing evil or bad about organizations offering to make that trade.<p>I also think people are too fixated on Google, when VISA/Mastercard, your Bank, your phone carrier, and your ISP have much longer, more comprehensive, and detailed records on your behavior that the police can, and have, been monitoring far longer and with less oversight. Remember Carnivore? Do you trust Comcast? I trust Google more to fight for privacy of my data against the government, than any of those organizations. After 9/11 AT&T practically rolled over for the US government. When a crime happens, the police can subpoena your email, but the reality is, they obtain your phone and financial records first. Google's stock price would go to $0 if there was a serious breach of trust, the company is built on that. AT&T or Comcast are not built on love of their products.<p>Google's ""Don't Be Evil"" motto is not about perfection, it is a value, a gradient, that you strive for. As Assange alludes to, Google culture is made of a mixture Silicon Valley graduate student culture, the hacker ethos, etc. The company chock full of 10,000+ people who believe or have internalized these values to some extent, whether you believe they are deluded cultists, or naive, that's how folks feel. There's simply no way Googlers would tolerate something like secretly sending user data to the NSA, it would be too hard to prevent internal employees from revolting. As an employee, I'd rather Google lose money and stock price and have the government shut them down, than send a firehose feed to the NSA.",1370141714

I was taking a lot of online programming courses and geting involved with local meetups, etc. When a friend who'd ended up in a non-programmer role at a tech company offered to put in a good word for me for a poorly-defined 'assistant' position, I went for it. I was honest about my skill level, and it turned out that there was a lot of work that anyone sufficiently interested could do. It was a lot of pretty boring stuff at first, documentation and testing, mostly. But there's always some small project that falls exactly in the 'inexperienced new guy' sweet spot--something that everyone wants, but can do without, and no one has time to write, or else something that some manager has asked for that a project lead doesn't want to waste developer time on. After I did well enough on enough of those, the requests to do the more boring things got fewer and farther between.<p>In general, my job search strategy has always been to look at opportunities orthogonal to my field. I didn't look for software jobs per se--if I had to compete against CS degrees I'd have been a goner. Instead, I looked for positions where I could use the knowledge I had as a multiplier for my productivity doing something else.<p>It also really helps that the market for good devs is pretty competitive. It means that once you're in and you've proved yourself a bit, it's easier (and often less financially risky) for your employer to take a chance on your ability to learn than it is to hire another dev when something needs to be done.<p>But as I said before, this approach sort of kicks at least one can down the road; if you start off at 'assistant' level, it's hard to move up in people's perception.",1370141058

Google has a very large number of machines, and an even larger number of hard drives.   Hard drives have fundamentally not changed seek times in over a decade, even as capacity has doubled (up until relatively recently) every 18 months.   So more often than not, for many work loads (not just at Google, but across the entire industry) are seek constrained, not capacity constrained.   So when Google migrated from ext2 to ext4, it's actually pretty easy to calculate how much money was saved by utilizing disks more efficiently, and the team which spearheaded this _was_ in fact recognized by the company and by the founders.<p>As far as the need to continue to derive new value to the company, of course!  This is true everywhere; the phrase ""what have you done for me lately"" is one that is not unique to any one company, and would _you_ respect someone who did one great thing many years ago, and then proceeded to rest on his or her laurels?<p>Of course there are many different ways of adding new value.  If you can demonstrate how a new cache server is faster or more scalable, and thus can drive value to the company, that's certainly one way.   Or maybe there is new technology, such as faster networking technology or faster flash storage, which means that assumptions made five years ago are no longer true, and that can be a justification to rewrite some part of the infrastructure.

In what sense do you think it's not?<p>It's called ""hydrodynamics"", google it.<p>A purpose built high speed electric train pushes around air, not water, and can move the same cargo with far less power and definitely less pollution.  Instead of doing 20 knots it would travel at 200 to 300 miles per hour.  It could also plot a more direct route between, say, Los Angeles and New York than going through the Panama Canal.<p>A typical container ship doing that route burns over a MILLION gallons of bunker fuel.  And there are tens of thousands of ships making that trip per year.  When I checked, fuel costs for the trip were in the order of USD $1.5 million plus approximately $300K canal crossing fees.<p>Between fuel, fees, crew, bonding, and other operating costs each trip probably costs well beyond two million dollars.  That's the competition.  The high speed cargo train I envision should be able to make the coast-to-coast trip for far less money, pollute less and make a nice profit in the process.<p>The part that is equally important is that such a train system would have vast ramifications across industry segments.  I could see it creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, if not millions.  I would feed the industrial base with much-needed cash.  It would provide a unique opportunity to build a massive power and data backbone to service the next hundred years of growth, including a transition to electric cars and trucks.  It would also provide a solid business advantage to the North American continent for the next 100+ years.  The advantages only multiply as oil price increases.<p>Looking at this as just an idea to get containers on a new-fangled high-speed cargo train would be to miss what lives below the tip of the huge iceberg such a national project would represent.<p>BTW, the idea isn't to eliminate all container ships.  The only way to make that happen would be to create a project of unprecedented international cooperation that would, effectively, connect the continents with high speed cargo rail.<p>An setup connecting US and Canadian Pacific ports to the Gulf of Mexico and US and Canadian Atlantic ports would cut cargo travel times from Pacific to Atlantic from about two weeks to a day or two at the most.<p>If you can get cargo from US Pacific to US Atlantic in two days you can now compete with the Suez Canal in getting goods from Asia to Europe (about 30 days).<p>Container ships could now travel from China to the US Pacific coast.  They'd transition cargo to land-based high-speed trains for a trip to the Atlantic.  Once on the other coast container ships would take the cargo to Europe and other destinations.  It would be cheaper, faster and pollute a hell of a lot less.<p>Strategically speaking, this would also place the US in a very unique position as the preferred cargo travel route between major world-wide sources and destinations.  This has to be good.  And it would be an advantage easily good for a century or more.<p>Going further, I could see a new generation of container ships developed to service the new routes.  The idea being to maximize performance at every level.<p>Yes, I put a effort into researching this a nearly every level.  It's hard to post references and links here because the information is spread all over the place and you really need to do a bunch of math to see the logic.  It was very easy to conclude that high speed passenger rail in the US is nothing more than highly refined political horse shit.  It has nearly no value and it will be a constant drain of resources as we keep them running for the few people who will use them.  You would have to both massively modify American cities, roads and culture for them to begin to make sense.<p>Don't get me wrong, I also understand it would be easier to prove the existence of god than to build a new true high speed transcontinental cargo rail system.

Sure, most corporate jobs are crap whereever one goes, but the odds aren't any worse than in VC-istan, and the ageism problem is less severe.<p>For one example, banking is considered ageist (most people retire by 50-55) by society-at-large standards but no one is going to look askance at you for being 40 and a non-managerial programmer. You should be at least VP by that age (and preferably ED/MD) but you don't have to have reports.<p>One nice thing Wall Street has done for its top (non-managerial) traders and programmers is use the title system to validate non-managerial high performers: you can be a ""Managing Director"" without having to manage other people. If you're going to have titles, you have to start giving them to engineers... even though a part of me would like to see titles just not exist.",1370139125

If nothing else, I work at Google (although nowhere near Chrome or Chrome OS), and a lot of our non-coding workflows already favor browser-based tools.<p>The vast majority of my day is spent in the Chrome SSH client ssh'd into my desktop Linux box where I've usually got a half dozen windows open in a persistent tmux session. I've bound tmux to switch windows with alt+function keys, so this is pretty comparable to working on a good old-fashioned text terminal with much prettier type. My development life is largely writing C++ in vim. These days with a suitable set of plugins, vim can make for a really solid development environment (with semantic completion, file navigation, etc.).<p>For the rest, well, most of that happened in a browser already anyway.

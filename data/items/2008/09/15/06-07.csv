I realized some time ago that I was moving into a world that I didn't like. I was closing my self off from my data, my services, and turning myself over to the control of others. See <a href=""http://autonomo.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://autonomo.us/</a> for a blog from this point of view. (Not my own.)<p>What I would love is to have an open-source dropbox like tool that can be installed on my own personal webserver. Maybe thats a project to consider working on. If my skills extend that far.<p>Edit: Clarified autonomo.us and fixed a spelling error.",1221461723

He has described the first two chapters in a 50 chapter novel of building a business.<p>I don't understand why he quit just when he started to get a bit of traction.  He got past his first lawsuit (it appears, and most employees of a company aren't aware of how much legal and sometimes government friction their is involved in running a going concern), he started to discover how important a D&B number (or a proxy thereof) is for customers who buy from him on credit, he overcame some serious product quality issues, and began to understand that running a business is hard, hard, hard work.  The story had just _started_.<p>And then, he quits.<p>Now is the time that he needed to start networking with other manufacturers (or wholesalers, or retailers, or product designers - or whatever he wanted to be) and understand how to improve his product design, his sales channels, etc...<p>It sounds like he limited his distribution to less than a hundred organizations.  Certainly less than a thousand.  The type of product he had _required_ knocking on tens of thousands of doors, calling, emailing, mailing, and reaching out to people who could distribute it.<p>I don't see where he hired his first employee, that would start to take over some of that manual labor, marketing, calling, packaging, delivery, etc...<p>I didn't get a chance to read about the technical improvements that he made in shipping, or even any of the passion that he had for selling.  I realize this was a ""All startups fail for different reasons"" + ""An MBA doesn't mean you will be successful in a startup"" type article, but reading between the lines, I wonder if there was an even better, ""I didn't really fit the Startup Character"" article - despite some initial victories.<p>Compare that to an entrepreneur who is passionate like Joel Spolsky - even on a completely trivial side project that I suspect is mostly part of his recruiting efforts for FogCreek he keeps blocking and tackling and overcoming obstacles (check out <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/oldnews/pages/December2005.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/oldnews/pages/December2005.htm...</a> for the summary of one)<p>Anyways, I do enjoy reading ""How my startup failed"" stories as much as ""How my startup succeeded"" - but I don't sense that his startup failed.  He just quit.",1221460349

You could feel the recession in the late 80's, early 90's. Everything just shut down as discretionary spending stopped. The real difference b/w the 80's crash and is that while a lot of money for houses has been handed out with little due diligence, there is still an tangible asset that can be sold. I'm not so sure this was the case in the 80's crash.

It's not fool-proof, but it gives a good overview in most cases.  There are quick tests that are obvious with a portfolio:  does it look good, does it make sense to you.  Beyond that, you could take some of their work and conduct usability tests if you, yourself cannot identify problems in that area.  Basic usability tests will give you a good idea of how well the designer understands it.<p>Another trait that you should watch for is variety.  Make sure they can demonstrate proficiency in a number of design styles (unless your needs are particular and they meet that area).<p>As for interview questions, you can get a good idea for usability instincts by asking for on the fly designs for simple interfaces.<p>If you have the budget, the best of the best are household names (or you can easily look them up).  These will be sure bets to get you a great design, but it will cost.<p>Something to consider when searching is to find a similarly structured application to yours, with a design you love, and find out who did it.",1221459102

1970532,comment,1969963,1970443,0,0,tptacek,,,"In a similar vein: Daniel Ellsberg knew the contents of the Pentagon Papers and knew exactly what the public interest was in having that particular information leaked. Mark Felt had a thesis about the public benefit in leaking Watergate. Jeffery Wigand knew what and why he was leaking tobacco documents. Mark Klein knew what & why about NSA surveillance. Those were purposeful leaks.<p>These leaks are indiscriminate. Does <i>anyone</i> believe that Bradley Manning had any idea what he was handing off to WL? Remember, WL themselves claim to have redacted those documents to protect innocents (the belief that they couldn't possibly have done so adequately animates much of the flak they're taking). If WL had to redact them, then the  <i>actual leaker</i> (presumed to be Manning) had to have disclosed them unredacted --- <i>to complete strangers</i>.",1291507102

Presumably, in the ""founder drives a Porsche"" scenario, the startup is not in imminent danger of collapse and the employees are not subsisting on ramen.  So if the founder decides not to cash out, the employees have the ""stable financial footing"" of having a job that, presumably, they like and are good at.  On the other hand, if the buyout was a talent buyout aiming for the founders or a shutdown buyout, if the founders decide to cash out, the employees may have some $$ in hand but are back on the job market.

I bet that every civil engineer, if asked at an interview, could explain the basic design of Galloping Gertie and the flaws that caused it to fail.

I bet that every journalist, if asked at an interview, could quote some of the advice of Strunk and White.<p>As a broad statement, certainly not always true, computer programmers seem to be less knowledgeable of their professional culture than other professions.  There is no equivalent to <em>Architectural Digest</em> or <em>Journal of Accountancy</em> or <em>Morbidity and Mortality</em> for programmers, so programmers have to work harder to keep up with their profession.  If you can demonstrate that at an interview, you have a leg up on the candidate who can't.<p>Do you have to know the linear solution to the maximum sum subsequence problem to get hired?  Of course not.  But if you know it, and the other guy doesn't, then all other things being equal, you get hired, not him.<p>I should also have mentioned that there must be some context to the programming questions being asked at an interview.  There are probably better questions to ask a PHP web developer.<p>Oofabz: Bentley recounts the history of the problem.  Several experienced computer scientists believed for several weeks that the O(n log n) solution was optimal.  If you think the linear solution is immediately obvious, you're special.<p>DannoHung: It may be that I have not fully specified the problem, but an empty sequence has a sum of zero, which is the maximal sum if all elements of the sequence are negative.<p>Abyssknight: I've never shipped anything.  I've always worked in an internal support position, never on a shipping product.  But I regularly develop and install new programs for my internal customers, in addition to supporting vendor code; I guess you could say I've shipped those programs.<p>Goombastic: I'm not a stupid HR guy.  I'm a programmer who has stopped asking this kind of programming questions because I don't think they tell me much about the candidate.

If someone came in with code owned by their employer with their employer's copyright on it and not their own, it would be absolutely critical to verify that their employer knew about it and cleared the licensing for that specific code in writing, or from some very public facing repository on the company website with explicit documentation about the license. Any sort of 'well it should be OK I think' or 'they told me it was all right' would raise red flags and require much more explicit permission.<p>It will be interesting now to see what the reaction of other contributors will be to the new policy that some animals are more equal than others. I have had no problem contributing to open source and having my contributions listed as ""copyright by various contributors"". But once one contributor gets his own name separated out in the code headers, then I want my own name in all those code headers as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if others would want the same as well.",1291506646

1970499,comment,1969854,1969854,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Sounds pretty reasonable to me. On the figures in the article, Facebook has an effective leading P/E worse than 20. That would be on the high side for a good investment in an established company in a vertical market, so presumably it is based on investors' assumptions about future growth and market directions.<p>Let's consider growth first. We're talking about <i>Facebook</i>. They <i>already</i> dominate the social network space, with an amazingly high percentage of the potential user base in many countries. There isn't a lot of growing to be done in terms of product base (i.e., number of Facebook users) in those countries. Likewise, Facebook users already seem to spend a staggering amount of time on the site. There isn't a lot of growing to be done in terms of getting people to use the site more and therefore increase the value of ads. Growing into other geographic markets might help, but they have still failed to establish dominance in places like China, so that's far from a safe bet.<p>In terms of market direction, though, it seems like all the most likely routes are downward. There must be at least three obvious risks of a business-threatening scale:<p>1. Advertisers could find a more efficient mechanism and desert Facebook <i>en masse</i>.<p>2. An alternative social network, or simply other ways to entertain yourself and keep in touch with friends, could cause users to desert Facebook <i>en masse</i>. (Keeping in mind that most of Facebook's power comes from its viral, highly networked nature, this is a serious risk: you only have to lose enough users that people can't rely on sending out news/invitations/whatever via Facebook and assume friends who aren't on it are weird.)<p>3. Privacy regulators could clamp down more than they already do as public awareness of the related issues continues to increase, underming the whole targeted advertising business model.<p>I suppose that's all relatively sane compared to Zynga, though, where the leading P/E isn't quite as bad but their entire business model is effectively based around the continued dominance of Facebook or a similar platform <i>and</i> their ability to keep people's interest in the long term.",1291506187

And the student would decide what level of certification they care to try and get. And much like a Ph.D. thesis defence, a committee would take an adversarial position to the student and if the student successfully defends what they've learned, they would get a shiny certificate of some kind.<p>Or maybe all will just hinge on a student contributing something to human knowledge by publishing a scientific paper which gets <i>cited</i> by someone.

That resonated with people and made the left look really bad.<p>Even in less successful Presidents like George W. Bush you see this.  Bush didn’t lie.  He really did think there were WMD in Iraq.  Any rational look at the situation makes that very clear (why would he push WMD so hard if he knew they’d never be found and he’d come off looking like an idiot?).  Yet rather than push the much more compelling argument that Bush simply didn’t fight the Iraq war competently you have people on the left screaming “Bush lied-People died”",1291505722

1970418,comment,1969979,1970353,0,0,bugsy,,,"OK, in a previous comment you said 'Google (my employer) ... cleared about 200 (75% of those requested) projects in the last year for copyright release'. Now you are not the guy that this article is about, or are you? Who released the projects? ""Google released"" means someone else there at Google, as opposed to ""I, as a representative of Google, released 200 projects"".<p>Now, many posts later, you are saying ""we released"" and ""I've been given the authority"" as if you were the one authorized to ""release the copyright"".<p>But previously you said someone else did. Did you get the authority in the time between the two comments? Who are you? Who at Google can verify that you have the authority to release Google code? What documentation of this is there? You say no paperwork is necessary? Is there an official list somewhere of which code Google legal/corporate has released? How does your term ""copyright release"" differ from placing something under a open source license? Usually 'releasing' copyright means placing something in the public domain. Are you using the common usage when you use the term ""release"". What about the 25% not 'released'? Did any of those represent code that had already been placed by the coder in a outside project? Were they informed afterwords to remove the code?<p>Here we have a coder who is contributing to a project who says the author of the code for copyright purposes is Google Incorporated. But he is not the legal representative of Google. What legal authority does he have to transfer ownership or determine contractual licensing terms of code owned by Google on their behalf? If he does have this authority, or it has been granted him by you or someone else, it has to be in writing or it means nothing. Yet you are saying it doesn't have to be documented anywhere?<p>Maybe this is authorized by the appropriate people at Google. Maybe not. Without any documentation of it, there's no legal bias for saying this © Google code is BSD licensed.",1291504024

As tablets, Chrome based netbooks and more advanced smartphones flood into the market we’re going to see a bunch of people who realize they just don’t need a home PC anymore.<p>* In business I think we'll see a big increase in user-focused design.  Too many corporations are running into problems with employees using web based solutions on their own to avoid the cumbersome software the company used (that was built based on corporate requirements rather than user friendly ones)<p>* In startups I think you're going to see the VC industry try to self regulate in the hope of preventing a bubble.  So you'll start to see a coordinated effort to lower valuations and force startups into business plans that become profitable faster.

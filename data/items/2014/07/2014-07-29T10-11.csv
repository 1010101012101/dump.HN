8101582,comment,8101276,8101395,5,0,dalke,,,"I can think of a few likely problems. The lack of surface area would make it harder to get fresh water; something that&#x27;s already difficult. One of the main exports is copra, but I doubt that growing coconut trees on a platform will be economically worthwhile. The same holds for other agriculture currently on the island. (Sea level rise would also affect aquaculture in the lagoons, but I can&#x27;t guess if it would be better or worse.) I expect it will be extremely expensive to raise the two international airports and over a dozen domestic ones.<p>Assuming intense agriculture at 0.25 acres per person (that&#x27;s 8x the current population density) implies 100 sq. km of platform area. I see that sea docks cost around $30/sq. foot. That&#x27;s just a bare dock, without soil, so let&#x27;s say $50/sq. ft. &quot;furnished&quot; and at wholesale pricing. (I suspect I&#x27;m far under the actual price.)<p>That&#x27;s roughly $50 billion, or almost 20x the country&#x27;s GDP.<p>On top of that, add maintenance costs. I can&#x27;t begin to estimate that.",1406631488

8101564,comment,8072494,8072699,1,0,dorfuss,,,"Well, very true. I have graduaded in cultural anthropology which is not hot among employers over here (or most probably anywhere).<p>Most people I know (in Europe) with such degrees join the crowd of 25+ living with their parents, supporting the left, eat vegetarian food and promote eco/pacifist ideas ;)<p>But seriously - most people I know have had very difficult time finding their firs full-time jobs. There is such a surplus of graduees with only non-technical skills and the jobs out there are very unattractive with telemarketing being the worst (IMO). I&#x27;ve read somewhere that on average it takes at least 6 months to find any employment.<p>An Italian TV station broadcast a program on a fastfood chain organising recruitment at a marketplace in a small city (Viareggo?). There were 50 candidates per one job offer(!). And the recruitment process was rather hard and expectations from the candidates high. Italy is one of this countries where finding a job is a pain in the neck, especially for people with no experience or in their 40. and 50.<p>The common stratedy is to shoot your CV around anywhere and hope that someone will invite you for an interview, no matter which industry or salary. One cannot be very picky.<p>On the other hand, though, after I finally got my first job, I participated in the recruitment process from the other side and I was shocked to witness that so many pleople did not show up at the interviews, came late, did not know to whom they came, what the company is about, expected very high salaries or started off enumerating the tasks they are not willing to perform etc., etc. Most of these people were &quot;unemployable&quot; as our chief of analysis put it. I couldn&#x27;t understand this and I still don&#x27;t. The remaining 10% of the candidates were great and/or overqualified. And those who finally were employed were not necesarily the best ones, but those who were neat, calm and submissive.<p>Edit: in my opinion it is very important to narrow down your search to, say, 10 companies you would really want to work for, and try to get in for an interview no matter what - go the place the employees go for lunch break, practice your elevator pitch, if you don&#x27;t know the name of the decision maker, try to get it from the news, blogs etc., and send them your CV by regular mail. Try to call them in their office - you have to be smart and lie a bit - if an office assistant picks up and asks why you want to speak to the director, tell her/him it&#x27;s about the job add (although there was no job add).",1406631194

8101560,comment,8100583,8101527,3,0,syedkarim,,,"You make a good point. Falcon 9 pretty much launches at will; they go up almost monthly. In that case, it&#x27;s just a matter of someone coughing up the $80M to schedule a launch. I imagine there is much more lead time necessary to build a Falcon 9 than there is to build an Electron. Dneppr could go up more frequently, since they have a stockpile of about 150 ICBMs to convert into launch vehicles, but for whatever reason, they don&#x27;t go up more often. Maybe the $30M price tag? PSLV is much more about advancing the Indian space agency&#x27;s interests than than pure commercialization, so that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t go up more often. But your point still stands, if someone had the cash, they could commission anything to launch--though manufacturing lead time also plays an important part.",1406631081

Temperature is an indicator of good climate. If someone&#x27;s answer to &quot;it is cold in here&quot; is to put a lighter under the thermometer then the problem isn&#x27;t the thermometer, right? It is the people who are confusing indicators from goals. And that is a culture thing.<p>If that is your climate though you can still recover from it (I know we are doing way better than before at least:)).<p>First steps are to embrace ambiguity and uncertainty in evaluations. The culture twist (when I have seen it) comes from &quot;Noone recognises my work&quot; -> &quot;Lets define KPIs for your work&quot; -> &quot;I am not evaluated fairly, look at how much work I do compared to guys that are evaluated better&quot; -> &quot;Lets define guidelines for evaluations based on our KPIs&quot; -> &quot;Everyone (except me) is cheating to score high on the KPIs to get better evaluations&quot; -> &quot;We need better KPIs that can&#x27;t be cheated on&quot; -> &quot;We are doing a whole amount of stupid stuff because people worry about KPIs&quot;.<p>I think the first two steps are fine. There is direct business value in being able to compare how you are doing compared to the previous month, or some other department or whatever.<p>The problem comes in the third step - once the KPIs determine how someone is evaluated, then you are in a downwards spiral, because now you are saying that how you get there isn&#x27;t as important as getting there. To get out of that you need to embrace the ambiguity that comes with letting evaluations happen, and maybe be &quot;unfair&quot;.<p>Basically - uncertainty in evaluations is better than defining evaluations on KPIs.

So a way to say, take EIP x.x.x.x, don&#x27;t ever release it and then indicate what instance to associate it to is great.<p>Another example of this feature is starting from an existing VPC and build from there, or even actually inherit information from the current state and convert it to an &quot;auto generated plan&quot; to build from.

8101448,comment,8097776,8097776,2,0,voyou,,,"A lot of this seems like it&#x27;s just MVC, except what they call the &quot;View&quot; is a traditional MVC Controller (the UI element that handles user interactions and sends these to the Model), what they call the &quot;Controller-View&quot; is a traditional MVC View (something that gets notified when the Model changes and displays that change to the user), and what they call the Dispatcher is what traditional MVC calls the Model.<p>They write &quot;Flux eschews MVC in favor of a unidirectional data flow&quot;, but MVC already <i>has</i> a unidirectional data flow (Controller -> Model -> View). Is this just a case of those who don&#x27;t understand MVC are compelled to reinvent it?<p>EDIT: Actually, the main addition over MVC seems to be that the Stores declaratively specify their relationships between one another (which are then resolved by the dispatcher), rather than the developer writing a specific Model implementation that explicitly orders the changes to related elements of the model. I&#x27;m a bit suspicious that this would be less explicit, and so harder to maintain, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.",1406628626

It&#x27;s a little more expensive than Dneppr, but they only have rideshares once a year. RocketLab&#x27;s biggest competition, right now, is The Indian PSLV. They don&#x27;t have set pricing, but I&#x27;ve heard that half of the stated RocketLab price is possible. But again, there is no regularity with PSLV.<p>There are a few other dedicated smallsat/cubesat launchers on the horizon, but that&#x27;s also a three year horizon. For the time being, the Kiwis will have a monopoly. Unless, of course, Elon wants to being back the Falcon 1. I believe that rocket had a greater payload, but also was a bit more expensive. Lockheed is bringing back the Athena, but I doubt they will be cost-competitive with RocketLab.<p>These guys aren&#x27;t exaggerating: This rocket is a huge deal for the advancement of the new space industry.",1406628057

Currently, the many exercises are generated automatically with random numbers every time but such a scheme is impossible with harder, deeper problems  instead the problems need to be written thoughtfully and carefully, something that is hard to do on a large scale. In addition, answers to problems are usually significantly harder to verify than answers to exercises and so would be hard to implement on a large scale like Khan Academy is trying to do.<p>Like you point out in this post, problems are probably best left (for now) to individual teachers who can spend more time and effort on individual students than is currently possible on a larger scale.",1310791017

Very few consumers have the ability to measure their bandwidth usage, and those that do do not have the legal firepower to challenge ISPs in court. I mean, even if you manage to get a day in court, who are the jurors going to believe - the ISP with the $50,000 traffic measurement box, or you with a BSD router lash-up? In practice, bandwidth caps mean that ISPs just get to either drop or drastically throttle your service towards the end of the month by saying you've exceeded your limit.<p>I won't accept bandwidth caps unless a) usage is determined by an open, transparent and verifiably accurate method and b) there exists an appeals process by which one can appeal erroneous cutoffs. Without that, the power inequality between ISPs and regular consumers is an invitation for abuse.",1310790929

2770118,comment,2767867,2769014,-4,0,andrewflnr,,,"In an atheistic viewpoint, using contraceptives is basically a bug. Look at the real motivations; it's so you can have sex (satisfy reproductive drive) but not have the burden of actually reproducing, so you can still be comfortable. One way or another, it boils down to that. The drive for comfort (or laziness, depending on how cynical you are) is, I assume, another survival instinct to encourage conservation of energy for when it's needed.<p>Basically, if you don't have an immaterial soul, all your actions are determined by evolution.

It's good that now pervasive technology is helping teachers relearn that children who occupy the same classroom don't all have to literally be ""on the same page"" at the same time.

They discovered ways to cheat on the drills: In the logarithms unit, for example, they noticed that the third multiple-choice answer was always the right one."" But as the article points out throughout, what online reporting and pratice has allowed is for children who are already attending school anyhow to use their class time to discuss what are actual PROBLEMS for each learner, with interaction with a live teacher, saving drill for times of the day when the teacher is not available. That's not a bad improvement at all.<p>I should mention that in my own family we spend money on the ALEKS program<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/</a><p>for our homeschooled children, and we find that very helpful. It has many of the same strengths of the Khan Academy program (but is not free, nor does it have audio explanations) with a more complete syllabus and more challenging problems. The ""knowledge spaces"" theory underlying ALEKS<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf</a><p>is quite interesting and will probably have to be reflected by any complete K-12 mathematics program anywhere in the world.

It is a most worthy aspiration not only for women, but also for men. No matter that I, as a man, may make breakthrough scientific discoveries, become a billionaire and donate it all to charities, or something else that makes a big impact; my biggest aspiration and the biggest legacy I leave to the world will still be my children.<p>> but a father can pursue his dreams because he need not be around after depositing a sperm donation.<p>A father plays just an important a role as the mother in raising kids. Since a woman's body is more involved in nurturing a child, the father provides for her and the children. And yes, this means a big sacrifice on the part of the father. But it is something that millions of fathers make willingly and lovingly, one that I will too. For example, I could say I don't want to have kids, a family, etc, and just put my whole life into business, make a lot of money, and spend the rest of my life traveling and vacationing. But if I want to have a family and raise kids, I can't do that. My family would need my money and my time.<p>> There is such a thing as a sustainable society that never reaches it's full potential...<p>You have a point there, and I don't have any hard evidence backing up my statement that a society cannot survive sustainably if its women are subjugated. But I'm not saying this blindly either - we do have solid evidence of the kind of detrimental effects a broken household can have on children, and I extrapolate this to a society and I just don't see it functioning sustainably if the whole society behaves like a broken household.<p>> Most parents want their children to be successful.

This is an utter UX fail!<p>2) The homepage needs less text. Its pretty obvious with the first headline what the product is. You need screenshots or a demo video.<p>3) The actual interaction on the quiz page is kinda cool. The ""x"" to close the popup needs to be much bigger though.<p>I know you know that there's more work to be done, but getting the UX right even on an MVP is key. Best of luck!",1310788953

Here is my take on the following points:<p>#3 seems like its in the new market and hopefully google will fix this problem soon because it makes no sense at all. Its def a new bug in this transition to the new market that goog is probably aware of.<p>#4 google support has always been horrible. try calling the android market reps in support. the more devs call and express bugs they can usually foward issues to the dev team.  Also stalk people on the android team on quora/twitter/google+. this works too! tried and tested ;)<p>#1 stats have always been bad. they go up and down and don't work for large periods at a time. our stats froze for about 2 weeks. hopefully this doesnt effect our ranking but with the secret algorithm we will never know. luckily we use google analytics and other tracking methods to account for this.<p>#2 market search is prob the most stressfull thing we had to deal with. for the past two weeks nobody could find out app in the market. it simply just dissapeared. we had 1000's of downloads a day that went to under 100. this def hurt our revenue and app usage decreased due to the lack of new users. prob end up costing a couple thousand in revenue.  luckily it seems like they are making an effort to fix this as today we started appearing again and the search results seem to be improving by the hour.<p>Is the market perfect? hell no! the android market is def bipolar and has alot of problems. For us we cant live with it cant live without it. the past couple of weeks have been crazy due to the all the problems our app was having with the search bugs, etc.<p>Hopefully as developers we can continue to help each other find ways to overcome the bugs and help google build a quality market.  Having a market that works is def a win win situation that I'm hoping to be a part of.<p>On the flipside these bugs have caused me to develop IOS versions of my app which I probably woudlnt have done if these bugs didnt exist. So looking foward to try that new venue ;)",1310788886

Private iniative was forbidden, even in the areas in which it would be useful. (source: I grew up in a socialist/communist country)<p>In that manner, capitalism with guaranteed income is different. You want to be rich, go ahead amd try your chances at trade, entrepreneurship etc. You see a market opportunity - go ahead and kickstart it. On the other hamd, if you lack a capability, or you prefer to do things that nobody will want to pay you for (art, raising children etc), the govrnment will keep you covered.<p>Obviously there are problems to it, especially today when production costs are expensive. And there are implementation problems as well. But still, one system is the ultimate oppression, another one is ultimate freedom.<p>Btw. The running joke in communism was: &quot;yeah, our system is perfect, it&#x27;s just the implememtation that sucks&quot;. I believe that communism was impossible to get implemented correctky, whereas capitalism + minimum income can be. Not today, but in a few years when the goods will be even cheaper.",1431770333

9555577,comment,9554936,9554936,0,0,anon-obviously,,,"<i>The complaint argues that elite schools “that use race-neutral admissions” have far higher Asian-American enrollment than Harvard. At California Institute of Technology, for instance, about 40% of undergraduates are Asian-American, about twice that at Harvard.</i><p>Interestingly, Ron Unz did a lengthy expose on this issue in 2012, and arrived at similar conclusions:\n<a href=""http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-...</a><p>He found ample evidence of anti-Asian quotas at Harvard, Yale, and other elite institutions, and perhaps more controversial, evidence of what appears to be a form of affirmative action in favor of Jews:<p><i>In fact, Harvard reported that 45.0 percent of its undergraduates in 2011 were white Americans, but since Jews were 25 percent of the student body, the enrollment of non-Jewish whites might have been as low as 20 percent, though the true figure was probably somewhat higher.51 The Jewish levels for Yale and Columbia were also around 25 percent, while white Gentiles were 22 percent at the former and just 15 percent at the latter. The remainder of the Ivy League followed this same general pattern.</i><p>Jews comprise a mere 2% of the population yet a massive 25% of the student body at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. The contrast with Caltech and UC schools with more merit-based admissions processes is quite stark:<p><i>But Caltech’s current undergraduates are just 5.5 percent Jewish, and the figure seems to have been around this level for some years; meanwhile, Asian enrollment is 39 percent, or seven times larger. It is intriguing that the school which admits students based on the strictest, most objective academic standards has by a very wide margin the lowest Jewish enrollment for any elite university.<p>Let us next turn to the five most selective campuses of the University of California system, whose admissions standards shifted substantially toward objective meritocracy following the 1996 passage of Prop. 209. The average Jewish enrollment is just over 8 percent, or roughly one-third that of the 25 percent found at Harvard and most of the Ivy League, whose admissions standards are supposedly far tougher. Meanwhile, some 40 percent of the students on these UC campuses are Asian, a figure almost five times as high. Once again, almost no elite university in the country has a Jewish enrollment as low as the average for these highly selective UC campuses</i><p>(Unz himself is Jewish, in case you&#x27;re wondering.)",1431770327

I&#x27;m coming round to the idea of a non-means-tested basic income. This would mean there are no marginal effects. For instance, in many countries, if you get paid unemployment you lose it when you find employment. This means you might need a very high income to make it worthwhile, because you&#x27;ll be losing the benefits as well as your free time. If it was simply a non-dependent income/tax break (if you have an income) you wouldn&#x27;t get this high effective tax rate. You could work or not work, totally up to you. You can take a side job, try new industries, etc.<p>There would also be less of a circus about controlling that you&#x27;re sending job applications (adds up to a LOT of apps for jobs people may not actually want), courses about how to write a CV, and staff to send out the money.<p>3) Other benefits of self-drive:<p>a) You don&#x27;t need to drive as fast. These things won&#x27;t need to sleep, so that&#x27;s a good few hours a day extra. You can drive slower, saving fuel, and still arrive on a current logistical schedule. Driving slower also means you can have a bunch of trucks really close to each other to save on aerodynamics. You could write software to plan truck trains for this purpose.<p>b) They&#x27;re all going to be electrical. I know, they aren&#x27;t currently. But electric is just taking off now, while ICE has had plenty of development. A lot of complication in modern cars is the ICE. You need to lug a transmission with you. You need to mix the fuel with air. With electric, you have regenerative breaking, engines are smaller, and batteries will only get better. You&#x27;ll use less energy, which will push the economics towards slow moving land-trains.",1431769731

Editing complex expressions is needlessly complex and doesn&#x27;t even compare to structured editing with paredit in Emacs.<p>Did you know that the frontend lets you double/triple/etc click to select outward up the AST? You can also press ctrl+period to do this. It&#x27;s indeed not paredit, but you can do most paredity things using this single primitive and copy/paste, and it&#x27;s not too painful (and it would only take a weekend to make a package that implements paredit).<p>Other than the lack of paredit, could you be more specific about the syntax isn&#x27;t good? You can always use FullForm if you want to write things in an sexp way.<p>I think the equivalence between prefix form (f /@ x, f @ x, f @@ x), and FullForm (Map[x, y], f[x], Apply[f, x]), and postfix form (x // f) is a nice degree of freedom when beatifying code. Sames goes for composition (f /* g, or g @* f).<p>Functions tell a story and having to write that story in exactly one austere syntactic way is in my view a disadvantage for making the story clear and satisfying.<p>> * The interpreter is slow. Really slow. Sure, if you call a matrix math routine, it will be OK, but try rearranging large data structures and you&#x27;ll end up waiting a lot.<p>I haven&#x27;t done benchmarks recently but we&#x27;re probably in the same ballpark as (C)Python. Maybe a bit slower. But if you&#x27;d consider using Python for a task it&#x27;s also likely to be handled by Mathematica just fine. In many cases there is plenty-optimized C code doing the heavy lifting, like if you use our machine learning functions or anything with matrices (or vectors/lists, or tensors, or ByteArrays, or Images, or Graphs, or ... :) ).<p>As usual, interpreted languages can even <i>win</i> when they allow you to describe a computation at a high level, and have that be executed by some smart JIT compiler. Julia leads the way, of course, but we&#x27;re working on similar things ourselves, particularly for Dataset (<a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Dataset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Dataset.html</a>).<p>> * Debugging support: what debugging support?<p>There is a built-in debugger in the frontend, under the &quot;Debug&quot; menu, that actually does a fair job of showing where in your expression the evaluator is at. I admit that I don&#x27;t use it much, partly because I&#x27;ve got a much more ambitious prototype of a thing that produces a browseable execution history. Hopefully that&#x27;s only a few point versions away, I just have such a crazy number of projects.. sigh.<p>> * The editor is a disaster. I seriously don&#x27;t know how people can stand it and how come the company invests so little in it. A single mismatched bracket can mean ten minutes of hunting for the problem. Code jumps around on screen all the time, seemingly with no logic to it.<p>That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re probably using Input cells. Input cells are for one- or two-line inputs. Use Code cells for large bodies of code. They don&#x27;t do automatic indenting and won&#x27;t jump around. If you wish to complain that this isn&#x27;t obvious enough, I entirely agree with you! It takes too long to discover the &#x27;right way of doing things&#x27;, which is a UX and design failing. And simple stuff like Tab on a selection of multiple lines doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I use Eclipse (for which there is a plugin), or Sublime Text.<p>> Syntax highlighting is nearly non-existent.<p>Syntax highlighting isn&#x27;t non-existent, at all. I&#x27;m not sure where you get that from. Some examples of things that are highlighted:<p>* Misspelled functions (functions without definitions are blue)<p>* Invalid numbers of function args<p>* Invalid options to functions (options=keyword parameters)<p>* Scoped variables for Block, Module, With, DynamicModule, Table, Do, etc<p>* Symbol shadowing (a variable in a Module shadowing another module, etc)<p>* Invalid graphics and typesetting and GUI elements<p>And beyond that, various little red arrows appear when you write something that couldn&#x27;t parse.<p>> It&#x27;s a complete trainwreck and I don&#x27;t understand why this isn&#x27;t seen by the company as a huge problem.<p>&quot;Trainwreck&quot; really seems hyperbolic. Whatever our faults, one of the things people tend to agree about is that we&#x27;ve innovated with the frontend, and others are only now catching up with IPython, Light table, etc.<p>And they have a long way to go. The frontend has reflow, a box language, cascading stylesheets, and something resembling FRP (though a bit less clean, perhaps). It&#x27;s really not far off from HTML in its flexibility and power.<p>> Hash-maps: these were only added recently (!!!) and they are not what I&#x27;d expect in a modern language. For example, if you want to do a map lookup, and your keys aren&#x27;t strings, you need to wrap them in Key[]. Come on.<p>Good thing we waited, though, if we had added associative arrays 15 years ago we wouldn&#x27;t have had datastructures like HAMTs to achieve both immutability and efficiency.<p>I&#x27;m puzzled. Both the subvalue lookup (assoc[x]) and the Lookup function (Lookup[assoc, key, default]) don&#x27;t require a Key wrapper, and those are the dominant ways to use associations. Key wrappers are only required when using e.g. Part, to distinguish e.g. the key All from the part spec All. What other behavior would you have wanted?<p>And design-wise, I actually think we nailed the design. There are all sorts of nice equivalences of the form Values[f[assoc]] === f[Values[assoc]] that give an association a well-defined &#x27;kinematics&#x27; -- they are like ordinary numerically-indexed expressions (e.g. Part[f[a,b,c],2] is b), but the indices are now arbitrary expressions. That essentially forces your hand with respect to many existing functions, like Sort, Map, Partition, Take, Drop, and so on.<p>And that makes them seem cleaner than in many other languages, which mostly treat associative arrays as little more than bags of tuples (e.g. mapping over a hashmap in Clojure is not terribly useful or efficient).<p>Plus, the order-preserving is just nice, even if there is a performance cost.<p>> I find that I use Mathematica for a limited range of problems. If I could have Mathematica&#x27;s library in Clojure with a graphical REPL, I&#x27;d pick that any day (Clojuratica is a project aiming for that).<p>Clojuratica was developed by a friend of mine.

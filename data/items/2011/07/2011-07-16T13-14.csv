It's an organic process and, as you indicated, timing has a lot to do with it.  Many of my posts here get completely ignored -- no votes, neither up nor down, no replies, no indication of any kind it was ever read.  Then sometimes a post of mine gets multiple replies and many votes when I figured it would be ignored as usual.  I am still trying to get used to that.  It is partly the scale of the place.  Personally, I find that refreshing.

Patents were originally for protecting tinkerers and original thinkers from getting their ideas ripped off by some corporation.  I love myself too much to read through the meat of the patents but it sure sounds so vague and general to software in general.  Any idiot who took CS101 could dream up a parser that auto-recognizes a phone number and make it clickable.  I mean scrolling, like really?  Do I need written permission from Steve Jobs to implement it on a touch device?  So now we wait until year 2050 before we see it on anything other than a iPhone?   I wonder who will be winning then, oh right probably Apple because now they cornered all the hologram related patents with their trademark ""no touch"" interface in iOS 21 and OSX Sea Lion while the rest of the companies were busy getting sued.<p>We need to rethink software patents.  Anything that hampers the next wave of innovation is pure evil.  Software, especially UI innovation with all the metaphors drawn from the physical world is nothing like inventing the cotton gin.  Sure we need to reward the the innovators but Apple engineers, brilliant though they may be, are intellectual slaves who don't own their own thoughts. Whoever actually came up with these things for Apple isn't retiring early that's for sure.<p>All this is great but smart companies are going to flock to countries where saner laws prevail or even the wild wild east like China where nothing is safe but at least they can focus on innovation and not second guess the ideas coming from their own engineers brains.",1310824336

I've seen the results of your theory, and it's not pretty.<p>> <i>Wouldn't it be nicer if everyone just competes on quality and price?</i><p>No.<p>To be <i>worth while</i>, investment in R&D needs to be recouped. If cloning finished products is legal, the clone makers don't need to recoup R&D, so can undercut the price of the inventor while (since it's a clone, perhaps even produced by the same factory) matching quality.<p>Also bad, such as with electronics, the consumer sometimes can't tell if the clone is the same quality or not until months later when inferior parts begin to fail (especially low quality capacitors in electronics, which have a tendency to look exactly the same right up until they burst).  Sometimes, as happened to Akai in the country where I lived, the brand takes the reputation hit for the problems from the copyists who were selling the copies at a price so close to the original the buyer couldn't tell whether they got an original or copy.<p>(A countermeasure to this is an invention so ahead of the market the production process is unique, and the inventor somehow manages to lock up 100% of manufacturing capability and capacity itself.

How do you know there is no other factor involved? How do you know no other process WAS involved in the past?<p>We don't. So far as I know, we have never observed macro evolution taking place in recorded history (although I would be happy to be shown wrong on this point), so what actually causes speciation is just speculation at this point.<p>Common descent is one thing. ""Evolution"" is a loaded term. What does it mean?<p>It's a bit like the people who claim that the Bing Bang Theory describes an explosion in the first seconds of the universe. Actually, the BBT just extrapolates backwards from what we observe today -- which is that the visible universe is expanding, and there is microwave radiation at its edges. How do we know there wasn't some other process earlier in the real universe, which would make our extrapolation completely erroneous? How do we know that the universe isn't infinite beyond our visible universe? Every year objects disappear further beyond the light horizon, due to the expansion of space. Who knows hoc much lies beyond that? And yet people talk about ""the universe had a beginning"" ... how do they KNOW?<p>Okay I just wanted to throw a crazy idea at the end: Maybe our universe is like a reverse black hole, with a singularity at the edges instead of its interior. Meaning that just as gravity increases as you approach the singularity in a black hole, so the universe expands faster the bigger a ""sphere"" you take in it.",1310822850

Because he was working from scratch, much of what he did was utterly wrong. His work on anatomy is astonishing, and the drawings beautiful --- but not correct, nor even a particularly good approximation. He also had no global system
to spread his results, so what he did well languished, undeveloped (the helicopter, parachute, some choice geological ideas, etc. ) Leonardo was a genius --- but a genius of his ability would do more, of more importance, in more fields, more correctly, and with more far-reaching results, than Leonardo ever could in 1400's Italy.",1310821827

The last ""big theory"" in fundamental physics to be confirmed in the lab was the electroweak interaction and that was 1983.  Many of the great physicists of our day,  such as Ed Witten and Steven Hawking have never had a prediction confirmed in an experiment.<p>To be fair,  there has been some excitement in experimental fundamental physics in the last few years.  Neutrino oscillations are confirmed,  there are glimmerings of dark matter,  and something interesting might happen at the LHC.  However,  even if Superstring theory is true,  it's possible that's there is very little new physics left to be discovered within reasonable reach.<p>Now,  look at other fields and you find similar stories.  There is a huge amount to discover in the field of biology,  but there's never going to be another Darwin or Crick.<p>All fields of knowledge face limits that are caused by undecidability -- computer scientists know they can't solve the halting problem by static analysis,  and the field of classical chaos has been dead for decades.  There's a linear plane,  and a handful of systems that can be solved exactly, each with a pertubative island around it,  and then a vast undecidable ocean.<p>He touches on the career problems of people in physics,  which is probably the field that's been the most pathological for the longest.  When I got my PhD in 1998,  the APS estimated that fewer than 3% of us would get permanent work in the field.  I found it quite hard to find a professor in my department who didn't have at least one professor for a parent,  so the odds for a bright kid who comes from a working class background and loves science are a lot worse than that.<p>For all we know we could be producing 10 Einsteins a decade but only keeping 2 in a lifetime.",1310821551

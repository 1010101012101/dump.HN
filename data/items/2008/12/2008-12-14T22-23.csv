I can force myself to, but it's just an unreadable mess.<p>My signature is even pretty bad. My name is quite long so I tend to just initial everything - otherwise I feel like a dbag standing there trying to sign something for like 20 seconds.<p>And in school, all my in-class essays/assignments were printed, any other homework I would just type up.",1229295117

Consider writing something like Gmail, or even just its chat client.

Wouldn't it be convenient if all of that communication code was the same for client and server?

Generally normal office hours (ie 40 hour week) are encouraged though depends on company and role, making friends with coworkers is normal, Friday drinks is standard possibly couple of beers provided at the office or head to a local together. I don't work weekends or evenings or work from home (ever) but you could find companies that encourage this workstyle if you want. Previous job it was totally acceptable to come to the office in shorts, t-shirt and jandles but some places have higher dress standards, now I just wear casual trousers and a shirt with buttons + collar.<p>Had a couple of trips to San Francisco last year (previous job @ startup), I prefer the balance in NZ as a long term lifestyle, though had a great time in SF too.

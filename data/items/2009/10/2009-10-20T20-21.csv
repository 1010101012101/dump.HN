893338,comment,892634,892747,0,0,slyn,,,"I would love to see some of these IPS panels in the Macbook Pro's.<p>Currently the only things differentiating between the stock Macbook and the 13"" MBP is build quality (unibody polycarbonate vs unibody aluminum), Memory Cap (4gb max vs 8gb max), default HDD size (the MBP is actually smaller), and the Pro has Firewire and a SD slot.<p>Granted the price difference between the MB and the 13"" MBP is only $200, but I think the perfect way to distinguish between the two is IPS. Seeing this manifest itself in the iMacs is really unexpected to me given the industry trend as a whole to keep displays as cheap as possible (I was previously just hoping for a simple bump to 1680x1050 on the 15"" MBP, which is what I own and will likely buy again in the future), but this gives me hope that better panel technology in the laptops is actually a potential option.",1256072363

893334,comment,892815,893286,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There are very few generally useful books about system administration.  <i>DNS and BIND</i> just happens to cover a subject that touches everything we do on the Internet; and covers topics that are often poorly understood, and difficult for most folks to get right through intuition and dumb luck.  It doesn't hurt that BIND is damned near universal in usage, so odds are extremely high it's the DNS server you use.<p>The Frisch book is probably a great start for general concepts, though:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Essential-System-Administration-Third-Frisch/dp/0596003439/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Essential-System-Administration-Third-...</a><p>It's been ten or more years since I've read it, but it's been updated every few years, and is probably due for a new edition any day now actually.  The concepts it covers (backups with standard UNIX tools, for example) are somewhat timeless.  It's probably not required reading, though, if you don't actually want to be a system administrator.<p>Most books are just re-hashes of the documentation for a particular service, like Apache or Postfix or Sendmail or whatever, so I don't really have any strong opinions in that direction.  When I had problems with Sendmail in the distant past, I found the O'Reilly book useful, but I've never needed third party docs for Postfix, which I've been using for the past eight years or so.  Books about specific software are also often quickly dated by new versions of the software.<p>So, that's a long-winded way of saying, ""Not really.""",1256072056

I had known Mark for a little while and had seen his (then unfinished) work with DiP. I knew about the license conditions, and spent a good few hours talking with Mark via IRC to convince him to sign up to Apress, let us advance him and essentially pay him to finish it.<p>I vaguely remember some terms that we agreed which made it favorable for Apress for the first few years, to give apress breathing room to recoup the investment we had made in Mark.<p>I took this to Gary and the rest of the editorial board, proposed why we should do it and how it could happen, and they agreed. I left not long after, but I understand Mark's book went on to several reprints and it seems new editions - all continuing to make for an excellent book.<p>I'm proud of bringing the book to Apress, and at the time we felt it was a really good match for a smaller pub to be able to do something a little non traditional and fun. I'm glad to see that it's made lots of people a good deal of money - and I'm sure that Apress don't want to lose the stream from one of their star performers. :)<p>It is hard though to keep making such unique deals as pubs grow- and, yes Joel - unless you are you, dictating terms isn't really something that most tech authors can do, as the secret is that only a very small percentage of tech books truly sell well. But all it takes is one committed editor who's willing to put their neck on the line for a good product-- and i think dip was one of those. :)",1256069334

If going to the university is mainly for attending classes and obtaining a college diploma above a floor value of respectability, going to the least expensive college that offers courses toward your major can be a great idea. My childhood best friend, a smart boy from a working-class family, did two years of prerequisites to an electrical engineering degree at a local community college before transferring to the state university to finish his degree. He said he had more personal attention from his calculus and physics professors at the community college than he likely would have had at the university. He also met a start girl who is now his wife of thirty years at the community college. So all around that was a good idea for him.<p>But if the university offers sufficiently strong networking advantages, and connections with really influential people in your hoped-for occupation, it may be a good idea to go to the university from the beginning, even at greater out of pocket cost. There may be a rationale for choosing a top-however-many nationally known university over one's own state colleges and universities if that university's reputation has economic value for job-seekers, as perhaps it does.",1256069154

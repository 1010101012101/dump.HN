I have run out of money a couple times, had to go up against inlaws who said I wasn't cut out to be in business for myself, etc.  There are times when I am so grateful for all the crap I have had to put up with in life (being physically bullied in public school, and much more I don't want to go into here) because these things, more than anything else have given me the confidence and ability to persevere regardless of what everybody else thinks.<p>But embarrassment has never been a reason I kept going.

Twitter doesn't really need more programmers. It needs to figure out how to monetize. So Twitter+Pivotal is not worth that much more than Twitter alone.<p>3. Square has obvious potential, proven monetizability, and the only thing holding them back from chasing the huge array of obvious opportunities is a lack of programming talent.

It's good to have to tool that does everything for you, but I'd like to at least be able to structure my directories in the way I want. For mixed-language projects you won't get rid of Makefiles either way, and they're really not that bad with the right include files or Makefile generation tools.<p>Using URLs to identify external libraries also isn't something I'm very fond of. Both because you'd have more boilerplate to type when using them, and suddenly the library is fixed to a certain internet location and VCS.<p>Meh, I can go on ranting about other things I dislike about Go, but it wouldn't solve anything. I'll just keep monitoring the developments from the sideline and see how things evolve over time.",1331709387

I'm not saying there would be no benefit to disrupting this industry, or that there are no reasons to do so, but even once you get past the inherent differences in business models etc., you still need to keep in mind that this industry is far more lenient towards piracy than Hollywood, and the American[1] anime licensing industry even more yet: for decades (throughout the 80s, 90s, and a good part of the 00s), American licensors basically turned a blind eye towards piracy, and the Japanese studios largely didn't seem to care about Americans pirating their stuff. Even when the companies started taking action, though, in the American companies' case, it started out with earnestly and politely asking people to stop pirating licensed series (and, surprise surprise, it did work - as it turns out, if you treat people with respect when you ask them to stop doing something, they're far less likely to hate you for it[2]). DMCA takedown notices have only been used as a last resort, and to my knowledge, <i>no one</i> has been taken to court over anime piracy (and certainly not random unemployed teenagers being sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars).<p>[1] I talk about the American licensors, industry, and fanbase here, but much of what I say is more-or-less directly applicable to the same in other countries, as well.<p>[2] Just so we're clear, I'm being sarcastic here. There's absolutely no reason to believe that if you treat someone with respect, they're going to turn around and hate you for it. There are cases where this happens, of course (and this response may be more or less likely then normal depending on the nature and reasons for your interactions with them), but it's by far the exception.",1331708524

6798573,comment,6796219,6796698,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is a poor argument founded on a handful of anecdotal experiences. The full reality of the situation is not embraced by your caricature of it.<p>I think you might have a bit of a different opinion if you had been incorrectly diagnosed with a more serious disease, such as cancer.<p>As a thought experiment imagine that I am a medical charlatan who is offering a test for women to find out if they have breast cancer. In truth the test is just a random chance of a positive diagnosis, dressed up with some props and procedures. What&#x27;s the harm in this? Well, the harm is that you put someone through hell when they believe that they have cancer. And worse the harm is that it can often take some very invasive procedures that have a deleterious effect on health to conclusively determine if someone does have cancer or rule it out.<p>Which makes a false diagnosis more than just a mild scare but a very real burden.  And also a drain on the health care system and the economy. Someone who undergoes unnecessary procedures, such as biopsies and blood work, will have those costs come out of their insurance most likely. Those costs come out of effectively a pool of money designated for covering procedures, shrinking that pool means that someone else will be denied coverage for some procedure or that premiums will go up for everyone.<p>Now one need not be an intentional charlatan as in the above example to nevertheless lead to the same harmful outcomes unintentionally. And that&#x27;s the sort of thing that can, and apparently does, happen with 23+me. If people are getting told about &quot;risk factors&quot; for very serious diseases through tests that are not very reliable or diagnostic then that will likely lead to a lot of unnecessary procedures in order to double check those findings. With all of the problems resulting listed above. This is a problem that the medical establishment has to contend with even with highly accurate tests.<p>So yes, it is actually a serious problem with no easy solution. That doesn&#x27;t mean that 23+me has to stop operating, but they need to be substantially more circumspect about their diagnoses.",1385431140

You have to design your stack in a way, early on, that supports failed assumptions, which means frequently changing requirements at the same leaving enough room to breathe and grow.<p>Scaling equates to specialization, you specialize in a specific area of your stack because your startup has grown in that direction. In a very early stage, there&#x27;s not much growth only a period of intense validation, so don&#x27;t overthink about scale right now.<p>If you are using PostgreSQL, just stick with it. You can ship things faster and troubleshoot better with stuff you know. In terms of fetching data, you can design it in a way that you actually don&#x27;t have to do any joins at all. Twitter still uses MySQL up until this very day, they&#x27;ve customized the core engine for their purposes.

I (and most HNers, I&#x27;d assume) wouldn&#x27;t shed many tears over seeing the extraordinarily exploitative and inefficient institution of college education go through disruption. My experience has been that online lectures, course material, and forum discussions are more than up to the task of replacing their physical counterparts (pause+rewind is a killer feature, and the discussions in online forums are miles above anything I experienced in section/recitation). Hands-on labs are about the only thing that ought to have a marginal cost in this day and age. But I hate to think what disruption could do to academia.<p>There are a handful of big (sometimes existential!) problems lurking on the horizon which absolutely rely on academia because incremental progress isn&#x27;t amenable to monetization. I&#x27;m most worried about the drug industry. It&#x27;s imploding (google &quot;inverse moore&#x27;s law&quot;), leaving the basic science required to get over the slump in the hands of academics, and I don&#x27;t want to wait 50 years for high-efficiency gene therapy (or let China grab the market) just because the research is tied to an outdated educational system. I know there&#x27;s very little anyone can do about it, but I need to know the extent to which college tuition subsidizes said research before I can form a solid opinion on disruption.<p>EDIT: Got off my ass and googled it. The NSF estimated in 1994 that 9.5% of research funding comes from tuition [1].

These organizations exist, yet childhood obesity is the highest it&#x27;s ever been. Americans consume alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and drugs live they always have. These things haven&#x27;t be struck a blow one bit by regulation.

And then Commodore pursued a massively destructive campaign of hiring and firing managers in the US (which, to be fair, they had a tradition of since early in the Tramiel era) to try to find someone who could build up the US market.<p>But they ruined their chances further by drastically under-investing in R&D, and continuously second-guessing their engineering teams, who were likely to an extent hurt by their proximity to the toxic US part of the company.<p>Commodore was an odd beast in that the international subsidiaries were always mostly independent - they ordered the stock they wanted from the parent company, but decided what they wanted to sell and how. Germany also got to design some products (and there were manufacturing there). Yet most of the product development were managed strictly out of the US where their product wasn&#x27;t selling well.<p>The A4000 was a pretty good demonstration of the consequence of the US management feuds coupled with putting engineering on the chopping block regularly: It was late; it was slow; it was expensive; it was ugly; it had IDE (the Amiga world was pretty much entirely SCSI, as IDE was CPU intensive in comparison, which was not what you wanted in a system that was already lagging in terms of raw CPU performance; this is what you got by putting managers used to PCs in charge of making decisions about Amiga projects - they saw SCSI and saw &quot;expense&quot; rather than one of the things that was vital to making an Amiga perform well at the time)<p>Before that, Dave Haynie had his &quot;A3000+&quot; pretty much done: Sam CPUs as the A4000; better memory bus; SCSI; space for an on-board DSP; AGA like the A4000. And fit in an A3000 case, which was actually pretty.<p>This was par for the course for Commodore, unfortunately. I&#x27;d like to say it was a great company, but frankly, while Tramiel did a few strokes of genius in his day, most of Commodore&#x27;s history is a history of being given fantastic opportunities - often through brilliant acquisitions - and scuppering them with a gusto that would make some think it was intentional (there was/is a long lived rumour that towards the end Irving Gould and Mehdi Ali were intentionally causing share price volatility to profit of it, rather than actually trying to grow the company).",1385429088

But the FDA has also stopped plenty of <i>effective</i> drugs from coming to market, both directly (e.g. no more Vioxx because it might slightly elevate your risk of heart attack) and indirectly (the billions of dollars it costs, <i>directly due to FDA requirements</i>, to bring a drug to market).<p>Is the assurance that FDA-approved drugs are safe[1] worth the inhibited advancement of medicine?

Hell, you could even leave the FDA in place if you want to, only limit its ability to restrict drugs to market.  For example, you could reverse their decision-making criteria: FDA will only <i>pull drugs from market</i> if it can be shown that the drugs are more harmful than beneficial for their intended use.  This would leave the choice to use a certain medication to individuals and their doctors, with guidance from FDA/labs who conduct the same sort of testing the FDA does now.<p>[1] Note that the FDA’s stamp isn’t really an “assurance” anyway.

First of all, they are very clear that this only applies to monetarily sovereign governments (i.e., not Euro members, not state governments).<p>Second is their claim that directly spending money into existence is the more natural way of looking at things, and everything involving debt issuance is a voluntary add-on. That&#x27;s not how things developed historically, but it does make sense when you think about how you would design a state-run currency from first principles.<p>Third is their claim that, as a first order approximation, even when all sorts of debt issuance dances are in place, the economy behaves <i>as if</i> they weren&#x27;t and government simply spent money into and taxed money out of existence. [1]<p>The second point is admittedly a bit philosophical and subjective. You might care more about the historical account than the first principles account.<p>However, the third point is quite objective, and if you have a concrete example of how debt issuance actually makes a significant macro-economic difference that contradicts MMT, I would be highly interested (and I assume MMT economists would be as well).<p>[1] One way to look at it is this: Debt issuance is a red herring; what matters is the central bank policy of (usually) maintaining a positive interest rate. Debt issuance is only a way of shifting the cost of this policy from the central bank&#x27;s books into the general government budget, i.e. it is a political that hides the true cost of monetary policy so that the public won&#x27;t be as outraged about it.",1385427910

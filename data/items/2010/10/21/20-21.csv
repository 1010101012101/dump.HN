What I want are applications that intelligently manage screen real estate themselves. My thoughts on this are still somewhat unpolished, but what I'd really like to see is automatic management based on need and importance. Clear, standard notifications (and as few as possible), cooperation between apps when two or more run on the screen, and a clear way to navigate between them. All the while there would be no title bars or min/max/close buttons to be found.<p>This isn't a call for more iOS in OS X (although it seems to be going that way) so much as it is a call to acknowledge the limitations of user ability and patience.

But if you’re building XaaS, marginal features are awesome. That’s because when you’re a service, what’s marginal to one user might be core to another.</i><p>I don't think this is any less true in user-facing applications than it is in APIs.  It seems to me that the main difference is that user-facing apps tend to be solving higher-level problems (eg. project management vs encoding video).<p><i>Our job is to provide powerful tools and let our users decide what options matter.</i><p>37signals also listens to users, but the total number of users per revenue dollar is higher, the scope of the usage is wider, and the cost profile (development, maintenance and cognitive overhead) tends to be different.  In either case any new feature requires a cost-benefit analysis.<p><i>But APIs are different. An API with 60 options makes for longer documentation, certainly. But if the options are well-chosen and well-documented, an API with 60 options is barely more complex than an API with 20 options.</i><p>This is certainly true for options that are simply wrapping command-line options of open source components.  However if you're implementing code on the back-end, these options can easily add complexity to the whole system.<p>It's true that a checkbox in a GUI is a much higher burden on the user than an option in service API documentation, but then again a service already starts with an order of magnitude higher usability burden than a GUI.  This is of course because APIs are designed to be coded against, so the amount of user effort expended is amortized over hundreds or thousands of compute hours.<p>I'm sure the author understands all this, but it just didn't quite come out of the article.",1287694511

Now maybe you can get away with it and maybe many employers do not know the difference, but many do and the two do not look the same. College education at the elite level falls in line with the signaling model of education. If you get into Columbia College as an undergraduate it doesn't matter to many employers what you actually learned, its merely a signal for other things--like that you can learn reasonably easily, that you value education, that you're a relatively smart person, etc. If you go to a general studies program that signal, at least to those who know, is greatly diminished.

1817386,comment,1815636,1815636,0,0,mjfern,,,"That Apple is deploying older generation CPUs in its latest generation MacBook Air is a further sign that the x86 architecture is in the early stages of being disrupted. Drawing on work by Clayton Christensen, the classic signs of disruption are as follows:<p>1. The current technology is overshooting the needs of the mass market.<p>Due to a development trajectory that has followed in lockstep with Moore’s Law, and the emergence of cloud computing, the latest generation of x86 processors now exceed the performance needs of the majority of customers. Because many customers are content with older generation microprocessors, they are holding on to their computers for longer periods of time, or if purchasing new computers, are seeking out machines that contain lower performing and less expensive microprocessors.<p>2. A new technology emerges that excels on different dimensions of performance.<p>While the x86 architecture excels on processing power – the number of instructions handled within a given period of time – the ARM architecture excels at energy efficiency. According to Data Respons (datarespons.com, 2010), an “ARM-based system typically uses as little as 2 watts, whereas a fully optimized Intel Atom solution uses 5 or 6 watts."" The ARM architecture also has an advantage in form factor, enabling OEMs to design and produce smaller devices.<p>3. Because this new technology excels on a different dimension of performance, it initially attracts a new market segment.<p>While x86 is the mainstay technology in PCs, the ARM processor has gained significant market share in the embedded systems and mobile devices markets. ARM-based processors are used in more than 95% of mobile phones (InformationWeek, 2010). The ARM architecture is now the main choice for deployments of Google’s Android and is the basis of Apple’s A4 system on a chip, which is used in the latest generation iPod Touch and Apple TV, as well as the iPhone 4 and iPad.<p>4. Once the new technology gains a foothold in a new market segment, further technology improvements enable it to move up-market, displacing the incumbent technology.<p>With its foothold in the embedded systems and mobile markets, ARM technology continues to improve. The latest generation ARM chip (the Cortex-A15) retains the energy efficiency of its predecessors, but has a clock speed of up to 2.5 GHz, making it competitive with Intel’s chips from the standpoint of processing power. As evidence of ARM’s move up-market, the startup Smooth-Stone recently raised $48m in venture funding to produce energy efficient, high performance chips based on ARM to be used in servers and data centers. I suspect we will begin seeing the ARM architecture in next generation latops, netbooks, and smartphones (e.g., A4 in a MacBook Air).<p>5. The new, disruptive technology looks financially unattractive to established companies, in part because they have a higher cost structure.<p>In 2009, Intel’s costs of sales and operating expenses were a combined $29.6 billion. In contrast, ARM Holdings, the company that develops and supports the ARM architecture, had total expenses (cost of sales and operating) of  $259 million. Unlike Intel, ARM does not produce and manufacture chips; instead it licenses its technology to OEMs and other parties and the chips are often manufactured using a contract foundry (e.g., TSMC). Given ARM’s low cost structure, and the competition in the foundry market, “ARM offers a considerably cheaper total solution than the x86 architecture can at present…” (datarespons.com, 2010). Intel is loathe to follow ARM’s licensing model because it would reduce Intel’s revenues and profitability substantially.<p>In short, the ARM architecture appears to be in the early stages of disrupting x86, not just in the mobile and embedded systems market, but in the personal computer and server markets, the strongholds of Intel and AMD. This is evidenced in part by investors’ expectations for ARM’s, Intel’s and AMD’s future financial performance in the microprocessor markets: today ARM Holdings has a price to earnings ratio of 77.93, while Intel and AMD have price to earnings ratios of 10.63 and 4.26, respectively.<p>For Intel and AMD to avoid being disrupted, they must offer customers a microprocessor with comparable (or better) processing power and energy efficiency relative to the latest generation ARM chips, and offer this product to customers at the same (or lower) price relative to the ARM license plus the costs of manufacturing using a contract foundry. The Intel Atom is a strong move in this direction, but the Atom is facing resistance in the mobile market and emerging thin device markets (e.g., tablets) due to concerns about its energy efficiency, price point, and form factor.<p>The x86 architecture is supported by a massive ecosystem of suppliers (e.g., Applied Materials), customers (e.g., Dell), and complements (Microsoft Windows). If Intel and AMD are not able to fend of ARM, and the ARM architecture does displace x86, it would cause turbulence for a large number of companies.<p>I just posted this as an article to HN: ""The End of x86?""

1817378,comment,1816268,1817264,0,0,scottyallen,,,"When I was at Google working on web search, we didn't push search infrastructure during peak hours.  I think this was mostly due wanting to make sure we had spare serving capacity to failover to, in case the push was broken/had performance problems/crashed/etc.  Note that ""peak hours"" isn't the same as ""working hours"".  Just a few hours when we saw our highest traffic.<p>However, we also had a strict policy of no pushing in the middle of the night, Fridays, or weekends, for all the reasons the article listed.  Most problems on a relatively mature system occur when you're changing stuff.  When stuff breaks, you want to have the people involved be fresh and thinking clearly.  You also want everyone who might be needed to fix something available, in the office and in front of their computers if something goes wrong.  Lastly, it's not sustainable to have your engineers/operations folks regularly giving up their nights and weekends for routine operations.  You should save that karma for when everything goes to hell.<p>This is all predicated on having pushes not negatively affect production traffic when everything goes according to plan, and minimize the impact as much as possible when something does break.  One of the best ways I know to do that is to increase the amount of traffic proportional to increases in your confidence that the change is good.  The idea is that any push starts off by only affecting a small part of your infrastructure/traffic, and the longer you run it without problems, the more traffic/infrastructure you push it to.<p>At Shopkick, we do this by pushing first to a single machine, watching it for any errors for a few minutes, then gradually pushing it to the rest of our machines.  If anything goes wrong, only a portion of traffic was affected, and the portion is well correlated to the probability of having a problem.",1287694027

That's just not how it works. Now I'm not saying you don't leave with debt--most of my friends have 20k or so in debt. I have about 9k, but that not the radically high number that is being quoting. The only person I know who has a huge amount of debt is from a family who has the money to pay full tuition (retirement funds, home equity, savings, etc) but would not pay a dime for their child's education. Now, maybe that's their right, but that friend (and former roommate) is the only person I know who graduated with such serious debt that they'd go to San Jose state for grad school (although he ended up with the mindset that what's the difference between 100k in debt and 250k and is getting a masters in Great Britain before likely going on to to law school).<p>The problem is not the ultra-elite schools--Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Dartmouth, Williams, Brown, etc--with large endowments and need-based financial aid. The problem is the private schools in the middle, places that charge 50k a year but don't have generous aid programs. If your choice is between your state's university and Lehigh or GWU and you don't have money, by all means take his advice. But if you don't have money, and you can get in to Brown et al, then go. It is a deal. I grew up in an incredible working class family, and I had to pay Brown $650 a semester,  my father had to pay about the same amount, and I graduated with 10k in debt...I did alright and hadn't won any fancy college scholarships.<p>As for his larger claim that graduate school trumps undergraduate in employers minds, I think that is true only up to a point. The rankings of graduate schools across subject are radically different, and graduate school can have a lot more to do with circumstance. My wife is working at X, so I had to go to Y, I choose to do Y part-time because I love my job, I wanted to be a lawyer in Iowa so I went to Iowa state even though I got in to Harvard (know someone who did this), etc. But, the signal of what undergraduate school you went to is pretty clear and strong in most employers mind. I'm not under the delusion that Brown taught me much, that I could not have learned anywhere else, but the school you go to sends a strong economic signal about your abilities merely due to the admissions gateway itself. Now, there are special cases where you find yourself in your 20s and all that, but to many employers, being organized and ""smart"" enough high school so that Brown, Yale, Williams, UChicago accept you, is a relative indication of your abilities, even if you went somewhere less prestigious for grad school.<p>Most importantly, though, on this second thought, is that the cases are not as clear cut as the author suggests. Signaling and employment are complicated, and they don't boil down to any simple formula like undergraduate reputation < graduate reputation or vice versa.",1287692807

It was pretty much a given that if the App Store for iOS took off there would be an App Store for OS X. If we were in a pirate movie right now we'd call that a ""parlay."" Apple has done a lot of things right if your metric is strictly financial success. Where people seem to be incredulous is that (although highly subjective) Apple has also done a lot of things right when it comes to user/consumer experience. Nerds are not the primary audience for Apple's products. My parents, grandparents, and people who are more interested all things non-technical are. An App Store on OS X (and the existing one of iOS) is good for the two parties most important to Apple, normal users and Apple.<p>If you feel strongly about how this has shaken out then I challenge you to ask yourself, ""why?"". There are tons of ready-made excuses along the lines of ""openness"", ""freedom"", and ""I don't like guys in turtle necks."" None of them really matter. The problem of how non-technical people find and install computer software is decades old. As designers and developers we've largely left that problem to platform developers, sales, and marketing people. Now someone has come along and placed a viable solution into the mass market all while creating the potential to make a tidy profit. We call this capitalism.",1287692609

It's also important to write your code so that only small sections need truly detailed proofs.  Error-robust code is a real winner.<p>The purpose of the code, the comments and the proof is to impart understanding to the reader.  Yes, people will make mistakes in writing the proof, just as they make mistakes in writing the code, but having them both makes mistakes much less likely.  Explaining both code and proof to colleagues reduces further the chances of error.  Running tests to support the understanding does even more.<p>It will never be perfect, because the specification may have bugs, the compiler, the hardware, there may be cosmic rays that cause bit-flips.  But having proofs, proper, human-style proofs, makes it much easier to have confidence.<p>In our experience it makes the code-production cycle faster and more predictable too, not to mention reducing the unpredictable bug-finding process.<p>Semi-formal proofs are a win all round, but in our experience most programmers can't do them.

I don't know if you have a good term for people who occupy their administrative desks like thrones (here, we call them ""desk popes"" translated directly.)<p>I recall applying to a highly-esteemed British university once, and I was aghast at what a sordid mess it was to apply as an international student (no info wheresoever, and Open Days was announced mere weeks beforehand), not to mention the admission gatekeepers themselves.<p>It's worth noticing how she got in:<p>>I spoke to a counselor at General Studies, who was similarly encouraging. I showed him my transcripts and the As I’d gotten at Columbia so far. He said: “Great! Yeah, you’d be a terrific candidate for GS!” He encouraged me to keep taking classes at Columbia and apply to GS for the following semester. I told him I didn’t want to keep spending money at Columbia if I wasn’t eventually going to get a degree. He told me I wouldn’t have any trouble getting in. And the credits would go towards my degree.<p>><p>>Except it didn’t work out that way. Three months later, I applied to matriculate at Columbia through the General Studies program. My application was rejected. Let’s just say I was a little pissed. I could have applied somewhere else. Or returned to SUNY Geneseo. But taking two semesters of classes at Columbia is EXPENSIVE.<p>Did she get in, because the rules allowed it, or because a guy there screwed up, and she called him on it?

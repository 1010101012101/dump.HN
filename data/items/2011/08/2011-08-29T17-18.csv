I mean, I didn't manage them by myself; my primary job was automating hardware failure detection, but I took my turn on the pager.    My personal focus was to see to it that bad hardware didn't go back into production;  as someone who shared pager, that was... offensive.   But really, hardware failure is less of an issue than people seem to say.   I mean, sure, it happens.  But not nearly as often as software issues that bring down the box, unless you count bad hard drives;  and those happen all the time.<p>Even with 60K servers, I quickly learned that if I found a lot of bad servers that were bad in similar ways, I needed to be careful before having them sent back to the vendor.  More than once I embarrassed myself blaming software problems on the hardware.   For the first 3-5 years of it's life, if the computer was properly assembled, very likely the only things that will need replacement are the disks.<p>My thought would be to treat the things as hard drives.  two options:  For the lowest tier of support, if your system fails, I leave it and provision a new one. Leave the dead ones in the rack until it's time to upgrade.  The second option is to put the boards on some sort of hot-swap power backplane, and when the thing fails, pop it out and replace it like a hard drive.<p>The question would be ""how expensive is it to make the hot-swap system, and does the manufacturer give me a warranty that makes it worth my time to swap 'em out and send 'em back.""<p>I suspect that if I can get 'em to give me a discount to not have a warranty, my best bet would be to set it up so I could hot swap whatever i used for storage, but if anything but storage failed, I'd just leave the system in place.<p>sure, maybe I'd want to offer 'premium' support with mirrored storage where I'd swap your storage if it fails, and yeah, in that case, expenses would be higher than a giant server with fewer disks. (by fewer disks, I mean fewer disks per 256mb guest.  Obviously, it has more disks total)  I/O performance is probably also going to be worse on the giant server with fewer disks, so I can charge more for the 'premium' dedicated hardware with dedicated I/O.<p>I mean, you get into the 'all troubleshooting must be automated' range much faster with those than with physical hardware, but somewhere between a couple hundred and a couple thousand hardware nodes, you are going to get there either way.",1314639818

Unless someone has been in the position for a very long time, it's difficult to attribute a company's long term success with the actions of its CEO. There are just too many variables. Boards want to hire someone with a resume similar to their own (ie, experienced and wealthy), and by definition that is going to be an expensive pool of prospects regardless of their individual management qualities. In reality there are probably a lot more people with the inherent skills to be successful CEOs than exist in that exclusive pool, but since the boards don't really know what makes a great CEO (or even whether there is any such thing) they fall back on the basic instinct to stick with their own kind.

I've never really been able to clean it up. I'm just naturally a little clumsy.<p>In my IDE, this is never, ever a problem.  Most of the dangerous commands require I go to the mouse, so I can't simply blaze through them on the keyboard.  Anything I mess up at the keyboard, I can always undo with backspace or a cntl+z.  Furthermore, there is visual confirmation of exactly what each command I entered is doing and a chance to cancel it if it's going to do stuff I don't want.<p>In Vim, this isn't the case.  I can be blazing along on the keyboard, attempt to enter a command, screw it up and enter not just one, but a whole sequence of incorrect commands.  These commands could be very problematic -- doing things that are hard to undo.  And it can be very difficult for me, as a Vim novice especially, to figure out exactly what I screwed up and how to undo it.<p>I know some of that may be remedied with more knowledge.  I'm sure there's some way to view a detailed command history, and I know it has an undo.  But I still feel as if, for myself at least, the danger of keyboard mashing screw ups completely counteracts any gains in productivity I'd make.  And given that I wouldn't really gain anything by using Vim, I prefer the comfort of my visually based IDE.<p>Aside from which, I'm really fond of the way Eclipse's windows are dockable and movable and I make frequent use of that feature.

I found all the criticisms in the article to be fair and accurate.  I'd like to provide a little more perspective here.<p>I think people don't understand how broad a field mathematics itself is.  In graduate school, one will gain a broad knowledge of one particular subfield (e.g. algebra, analysis, topology/geometry, or discrete math, for instance), a very deep knowledge of a particular subject within that subfield (e.g. sheaves of smooth functions on manifolds), and become the world's leading expert on a particular subject (the dissertation).  Along the way, one will certainly pick up at least a couple of courses in perhaps 2 or 3 other major subfields sufficient to pass the comprehensive exams set by the department, but that's it.<p>So, a mathematician graduates knowing a lot about very little compared to the whole of mathematics.  Over the course of an entire career, one will usually pick up bits and pieces that were neglected in grad school, and perhaps enough knowledge to contribute in <i>maybe</i> one or two additional subfields.<p>This, of course, is how it works for an average mathematician -- the average Joe or Jane who makes it through grad school.  Superior mathematicians might contribute more broadly (Erdos comes to mind), but they're sufficiently rare that we can practically discount them.  Charlie Epps goes beyond this because dramatic license allows (indeed, practically requires) him to.",1314638558

2937957,comment,2935944,2937393,13,0,sophacles,,,"I don't think the core of the idea is literal randomness injection. Compare for a moment high precision measuring devices. Any decent measuring device comes with a manual describing the tolerances of the device, the error rate, the expected skew caused by error and so on. They may be highly accurate, and very precise, but they don't claim 100% accuracy. Yet, ideally, this should be a simple task -- the math says if we do X to make the device, there is only one solution and the device is perfect. We take pains with these devices to construct them perfectly, but errors still slip in - and we acknowledge it. To counter these errors we do statistical analysis on the machines' output, we scrutinize anomalous readings and discard or normalize data within the error range and otherwise account for errors.<p>Look now at the Bush/Gore election cited above, in light of this. A vote is simply a measurement of the people's desire for leader X or leader Y. This measurement is taken via a tool called the ballot. The ballot is for some reason taken as an ideal measuring device - for some reason we think it is a perfect tool of measurement. Yet, a huge chunk of the debate and contention of the scenario came out of problems with the ballot itself -- hanging chad, butterfly ballot confusion, and so on, are all measurement issues. At some point, we should have said ""look this is just too close to call with our ballot measuring system, other measures or means should be used to determine the outcome"".<p>The same is true of tests, they are an imperfect measuring system we are trying to treat as idea; so are many other systems you allude to.<p>The core idea here, is to stop treating our measurements as some sort of ideal measurement and instead look at alternate measures and methods once you get within the error range of the original measuring device -- at this point you are in the realm of ""luck"" anyway, because there are other unaccounted factors affecting the measurement anyway. Further, it has no more effect on cheating than treating an imperfect measure as ideal -- cheaters in both cases attempt to exploit unnoticable issues in the measurement. Statistical cheating detection already considers this sort of thing anyway, if the statsticians are any good.<p>As for the social situation you present -- this is a trickier problem, but I suspect a large portion of it could go away once proper understanding is given to people. A lot of the ""unfair"" complaints are essentially based around ""the measure is perfect, so if I can tweak the value measured of my by a small bit, it has some fundamental implication"". Essentially we need to train people on the difference between platonic ideals and the realities of the scenario. Then instead of complaining over obscure minutia, energy can be focused on either bettering the overall situation, or bettering the measurement.<p>As to your final point: ignoring the imperfectness and pretending it is perfect does not really change the gaming problem, in fact it adds to it, because when you treat the imperfect as perfect, you must have lots of complicated rules, which also allow for crazy gaming. Instead effort could be better spent on gaming detection or simple administrator investigation/oversight.",1314638531

On the one hand, I think he's spot on highlighting the aspects of Numb3rs that are unrealistic:<p>* Time frame for both gathering data and performing analysis<p>* The incredible depth and breadth of Charlie's knowledge<p>To enjoy the show, you simply have to think of Charlie as a superhero and suspend your disbelief as if you were watching Spiderman or Superman.<p>However, the author spends a good chunk of the post attempting to persuade readers that Numb3rs can be thought of as a propaganda vehicle for persuading the masses that a math-based surveillance society is good and necessary. I disagree.<p>First, there are several episodes featuring poor ethics at the FBI, NSA, prison officials, etc. which sometimes includes manipulating surveillance information (i.e. 216 Protest, 310 Brutus, 313 Finder's Keepers, 608 Ultimatum).<p>Second, one of the great appeals of the show in general is intense exploration of ethics, with the father and two sons of the Epps family frequently challenging each other and themselves.<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, this show appeals to geeks (most people I know who love this show are math/engineer/computer enthusiasts or close to it). You don't get into the hearts and minds of the populace at large by doing virtuoso math demonstrations tied with intense discussions of ethics.<p>Though I disagree with the propaganda angle (and the off-hand comments about how Numb3rs-type thinking is partly responsible for the house boom and bust), I think it was a great, thought-provoking post, which did a good job of listing out the elements of numbers which stretch the bounds of credulity.<p>EDIT: typos, inserted specific show names",1314638524

I like to differentiate between the notions of hand-testing code and automated-testing code.  I firmly believe code written should be verified somehow.  I have not totally bought into writing tests.  Right now, there is a lot of snake oil about what is better than what, and I would like to see good scientific studies that point in solid directions.<p>Some of the blur is caused by different kinds of programmer experience.  We have to work with the ""art"" and ""creativity"" variable here, along with ""has seen a similar pattern before"".  The other problem is asking the right question:  <i>What kinds of testing can create a consistent and solid improvement in acquiring money (or some other important pointy-haired boss measurement) over a 10-year period of time?</i><p>There are things that can make us feel good, nice placebos.  For example, 100% test coverage is known to not equate to good, working, maintainable code: you may be missing features or doing things completely wrong, but your tests validate that your wrong thing or lack of thing is working.<p>Is there a magic bullet?  Probably not... but it is widely believed (and probably justifiably so) that automated testing helps somehow.  People will expound on the benefits.  Personally, I want numbers.

In a nutshell the site is a place for programmers, designers & IT folk to share links to what they're discovering online. Yes, it's similar to HN. But that's a different discussion. By far the most popular feature of the site is the weekly ""best of"" email. The top ten most popular links get emailed out each week. I'm thinking of expanding on this concept and allowing users to curate tags. For instance, 1 or more users could sign up to curate the PHP tag. They would be able to add links that were posted to the site under that tag to a curated list that they could then send out as a newsletter. Those users who have subscribed to that tag would receive the newsletter.<p>I really value the feedback ideas get here on HN so here are some of the things I'm questioning. I'd love to get some critique of these ideas going in the thread below.<p>1) Should I limit the curation of a tag to 1 user or allow many?
2) Should the newsletter list the curators, thus giving exposure to those doing the work.
3) Should I mandate a max or min frequency to the newsletters? For instance, should the curators be poked if they haven't sent out a newsletter in over a week?
4) Is this something you'd find interesting and would sign up for?
5) Should I allow curators to enter their own descriptions for the newsletter or just include the link and title in it?<p>Thanks in advance.",1314637406

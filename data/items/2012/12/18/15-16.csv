Building a highly reliable system is far cheaper when you reach the scale of Google or Amazon because you can rationalize purchase. Actually, I bet price of hardware can totally be neglected next to admin and bandwidth cost.<p>> On the other hand I've got 50 GB worth of data uploaded on Flickr. You can't tell me that 50 GB of redundant on-demand storage is worth $25 / year, unless you live in some kind of fairy land.<p>I must live in fairy land. :-) You can buy 4 decent 1TB for 400$  that will allow you to cater for 20 users at 20$ per user. Conservatively you can expect them to live 3 years on average which brings the cost to 7$ per user per year. Add a 400$ server good enough to do software RAID. Let's say 5 years of life expectancy it adds 5$. It's 12$ per user plus network cost on a lan.<p>Flickr uses better material and pay bandwidth and admin.

If users want to choose their name, how is it relevant if it's frustrating for _other_ people to be unable to locate them?<p>Well, because that's the way Facebook works. They made a decision early on to require real names because most of the value of Facebook hinged upon the ease of finding friends and family. Imagine if the white pages allowed people to use pseudonyms. It wouldn't be worth much, would it?<p>> How many people are searching the ex-gf/-bf by name to stalk and see what they're up to?<p>Dunno, lots? Who cares?<p>> And - frankly: I know more people on FB with 'fake' names than with 'real' ones. Family, friends, random acquaintances, 70% don't use their real name. The range is from fantasy names (like, obviously invalid/~random~), to play on words/phrases (localized variants of 'Some Dude' or similar) to the braindead exercise of writing your name backwards (you'd be there as ""Kram Rettun"").<p>This is purely anecdotal but I would put the rate of actual names used among my friends at around 99%. Now, granted, that may because I haven't <i>found</i> the acquaintances from my past who do use fake names, but that only bolsters my point. If most people used fake names then a large part of the appeal of Facebook would dissipate.<p>> Isn't it very frustrating as well if people got married and - whoa - just give Facebook their _current_ 'real name'. You wouldn't be able to find them. Maybe the service should require you to list the maiden name, blocking you for failing to do so?<p>Facebook has a solution for the maiden name problem, btw, (by allowing users to enter an ""alternate name"")[<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/131728300237162/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/help/131728300237162/</a>], and again, this is purely anecdotal, but I see a very high percentage of people in my network taking advantage of this feature. I would wager it's because most people <i>want</i> to be found by their friends and family.<p>> Against the TOS? Yeah, sure. Impossible to enforce for localized jokes or seemingly valid names anyway. And quite frankly, if it's 'frustrating' for people that want to search for old contacts is really, really not interesting _for those users_.<p>I don't personally have a problem with people circumventing Facebook's TOS and I'd gather that Facebook probably doesn't care all that much either. What I <i>do</i> have a problem with is a government arbitrarily setting a TOS for a website that people can choose whether or not to use.",1355843529

You can't just patch IE because the bug would still allow arbitrary execution of kernel code (privilege escalation) from any application, including from inside IE's sandbox. And you can't drop AddFontMemResourceEx from the OS or alter the behavior of font file loading without rewriting pretty much every application that handles fonts.<p>So, what MS did here is entirely correct.

I'd love to have some competition on the market and I'd love them to show some amazing products that inspire everyone.<p>That being said the writing was on the wall.  Microsoft is blindsided by two cash cows and they're not willing to reinvent themselves.<p>Microsoft has Windows and Office that make them money. Everything else is secondary and helped them control that market.  It's a Napoleonic approach to business (read Bill Gates' biography to understand that).<p>How Microsoft made its initial money was by undercutting everyone and selling a licence for their first OS to IBM so Big Blue had to spend less money per machine sold.  It worked so well that MS became the richest and most powerful high tech company.<p>Now the open source community releases powerful office suites for free, Apple releases an amazing office suite for 1/5th of the price of MS Office and Google releases something essentially free that works online!<p>When everyone else is moving ahead... it's hard to have anything to say that is positive about the stubborn MS.",1355842907

You can write bad code in any language. Perl might allow for more obfuscated code which really makes it harder to read - but that again reflects on the programmer - not the language. Take a look at a code in PHP, Python, C, or any language written by ""newbs"" and you will see poor practices used everywhere.",1355842903

For some people, contact information is a very sensitive matter, and celebrities are the <i>uninteresting</i> case, compared to those being stalked, witness protection, etc. How are we going to deal with this?<p>Especially in light of the fact that the data is essentially unprotectable.

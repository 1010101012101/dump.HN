If you limit it to professional advancement, then sure -- although getting involved in department/university administration counts somewhat as a secondary route. But status can also come from being valued and respected by the people around you -- e.g. being admired as a mentor by the PhD students you're supervising. Surely this prize is a step towards recognizing that?",1276941167

It's not for everybody. Check out a few of the popular blogs (FT Alphaville is a good one) and see if you would be capable of living in that world.<p>The same way that hackers love to code and talk nothing else, quants talk markets and nothing else.",1276940207

(In rare cases it can be worth eliminating primes which occur in 4 relations or more, but usually not.)",1276940101

1444405,comment,1444212,1444212,0,0,hooande,,,"People can interpret a data set in so many ways. I don't know which people you put into the ""technology"" and ""finance"" categories. I just went with the people that Forbes put into the categories of ""Finance"" or ""Investment"" vs the people that they put into the categories of ""Internet"" or ""Software"". I ran some numbers on the data they provided and here's what I found:<p>Finance/Investments:<p><pre><code>  Total People: 81
  Avg Net Worth: 181.77
  Avg Age: 62.32
</code></pre>
Internet/Software:<p><pre><code>  Total People: 48
  Avg Net Worth: 321.47
  Avg Age: 45.43
</code></pre>
The net worth is in millions I guess, but the numbers don't seem to jive (Bill Gates is worth $85B??)<p>It seems that technology > finance, in terms of net worth and number of years required to achieve that worth. While a financier may be more likely to make the list, the expected value for a tech entrepreneur seems to be much higher.",1276939865

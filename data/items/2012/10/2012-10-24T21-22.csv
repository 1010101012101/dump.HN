My concept is to help people solve their emergencies (not life or death but something that defines a motivated buyer) in finding products or services.
I go on Twitter and search for tweets like back hurts, anyone know a good chiropractor or my phone cracked anyone know where to get it fixed. 
I would call or email the businesses in their area that could solve their problem.
In this email I would say that I have a lead and ask them to reply.
All the replies would go on a page where the buyer would be able to easily send messages to the vendors which I had hoped would turn into a chat.<p>The problems:
Maybe I am finding products for people that are priced too low because people are not willing to pay for our searching and businesses are not willing to pay for the lead. If I could validate the lead it could help but thats hard to do with people off Twitter.<p>Looking to the future:
I would love if I could somehow transition from people off Twitter to the corporate market where I could hopefully charge more and when the products/services searched for would be more repeatable. Do you think a corporation has any needs/emergencies that could be filled regularly?<p>The value I provide:
I save time and frustration in searching, calling, and emailing. I also provide multiple vendor options during an emergency. At one point I had hoped that I could even get the people to negotiate on prices with the vendors or maybe that the vendors would compete a bit for the lead and offer discounts.<p>Any help is appreciated. If the answer is drop it and move on to something fresh, it is welcome if you could provide a new possible startup idea. Thank you.",1351115991

I was at a talk where they discussed the hard part isn't discovering the skimmers, its catching the crooks when they cash out. So some enterprising folks are noting that the skimmers are installed and then logging all the customers who use the ATM, once they have customer records they then flag transactions on all of those accounts and wait for the crooks to try to cash out. They have caught folks with literally a bag full of cards with pins written on them trying to pull $200 - $500 out of each account.",1351115988

Quite the reverse: it happens because being broke is a disadvantage, so people who succeed despite broke-ness have to have been better in some other respects. (In some cases they might just have been luckier.)<p>I bet you'll find that professional basketball players who are short are especially fast, that professional academics who score worse on standard intelligence tests are more creative, that expensive houses that are in nasty areas are particularly large or beautiful, that successful singers with unimpressive voices are especially gifted musically, etc., etc., etc. None of this means that those features are advantages.<p>Sorry, but this is just stupid.",1351115977

4695255,comment,4693655,4694162,2,0,chaz,,,"Unfortunately, I don't have concrete data. I should have been more careful to recommend that the author start testing with one post per day, and measure from there.<p>It does depend upon the page, though. If your posts get high engagement, it will have higher distribution. Of the author's 55k fans, only 14k fans are ""talking about"" the page, so they'll have less than full distribution. To be frank, their posts are not getting many likes. Thus, my recommendation to just do one great post per day. Also, I would suggest to the author to experiment with photos and not just links with photos. Facebook's push toward bigger photos in the feed is no accident -- they work.<p>There are definitely brands that have multiple posts per day, and it's largely because of the high engagement their posts drive.  Two examples that I follow are ""I Fucking Love Science"" and ""Humans of New York."" They both have fewer fans than talking about, and both post multiple times a day. Because their content is highly shared, it gets great distribution. It also depends on your own engagement with the page too, as I understand it.<p>The best practice I hear about Twitter is to indeed publish multiple times a day. Because it acts more as a true feed and not a digest, repeating the same content at a different hour is considered to be good.",1351115859

4695250,comment,4694663,4694663,3,0,Nvn,,,"There are a few things you should take into account:<p>1. You determine the 'dominant' colours to be the centroids of your clusters. The centroid is the mean of the points within the cluster, this mean is not necessarily a colour that is in your image. If you, for example, take a picture divided into four different solid coloured squares, and use this to find the 3 dominant colours it will average 2 (or more) colours. (The same might happen for more complex images with a a lot of contrast).<p>2. When randomly initializing k-means there is a good chance you'll find one of the local optima, so running it more than once will return different colours. In general it is good practice to run it several times and choose the outcome with the lowest cost.<p>3. K-means can take a long time to converge; limit the amount of iterations it can do.<p>These things aside, very cool usage of k-means on image data!",1351115775

Where is this information coming from and what was the context in which it was mentioned?<p>What follows is speculation, but it's easy to imagine that out of a total fanbase, only a certain percentage ""catch"" your post while it's fresh, before it's buried behind newer stuff coming in from the ever-increasing number of pages people like. While it may have been the case that back in the day the response one got from posting something on a facebook page was much better than it is now, it's also true that facebook was never as popular as it is today and that users' newsfeeds were never as busy as they are now. And as people subscribe to multiple publishers and their attention gets diluted, you can't expect their engagement with all of these pages to remain at pre-growth levels (or grow).<p>There's another twist to this. Too many posts from pages thumping activity from friends may alienate users. How do you balance these two types of information? Someone's going to get less airtime, and since (I assume) the bulk of posts comes from pages, they get silenced based on whether or not you interacted with them recently and whatever other criteria facebook can come up with. Same for friends you don't care much for.<p>Whether or not facebook can be more transparent with regards to how it determines which posts to show and which to hide is another issue. Does the average Joe care? Will he mess things up if given controls that are too advanced? Note that Facebook doesn't censor information, it merely filters what you see by default. You can still go to individual pages or profiles and see their full activity.<p>There also seems to be a backlash against any commercial endeavour facebook may have. ""Facebook is selling your information!"" - is it? where can I buy this information? is it really selling in the sense that most people would understand? No. But that's the term that is being used. ""Facebook is making people pay for airtime!"" well, kinda. Personally I think that should be ""Facebook is making people pay for ADDITIONAL airtime"" for all the reasons stated above. Maybe they got into this mess due to poor communication but I don't buy the ""broken on purpose"" argument. That's against facebook's interest in the long term.<p>I don't mean to defend facebook, just bring into discussion the potential complexities behind developments which people tend to imply are malicious.",1351114559

I'll quote the relevant parts here.<p>""Get Over the Paranoia: The story may be apocryphal, but Nordstrom supposedly allowed a customer to return an automobile tire that he insisted he bought at the store. Of course, Nordstrom doesn't sell tires.<p>""The paranoid would ask, ``But what if everyone who owns a car returned tires to Nordstrom? Nordstrom would go broke!'' But people won't (and don't), and Nordstrom will never be in danger of going bankrupt for accepting returns of goods it doesn't sell.<p>""Managers are afraid to implement customer-pleasing, revolution-catalyzing policies because they are afraid that too many people will take advantage of these policies, and they'll end up with the equivalent of a store full of tires.""<p>The entire section goes on to talk about employee empowerment, allocentralism (putting yourself into your customer's shoes), examples from other businesses that either do this or don't, and so on; the relevant summary part from the text would probably be, ""However, if your competition is asking people to do something suboptimal, then it's creating an opportunity for you.""<p>So, straight up: it's certainly possible to run a business the way that you're describing. In fact, I'd guess that that's how most businesses run: they do as little as possible to make their money and meet -- <i>but not exceed</i> -- their customers' expectations. So you're not wrong as far as that goes.<p>But you <i>are</i> wrong to assume that they'll have ""a ton of noobs"" if they treat one particular customer really well. And, you're equally wrong to assume that having ""a ton of noobs"" is a <i>bad problem to have</i>; from another part of the same section of the book: ""For example, a Whirlpool employee taped a news program's interview with Gail, a woman with several children and a full-time job. Whirlpool employees were challenged to provide appliances that would ``take care of Gail.'' In response, they redesigned the stovetop of Whirlpool's CleanTop to be completely flat, without grease traps or dirt-collecting crevices, and they created the Quiet Partner dishwasher, so the noise of the dishwasher wouldn't distract Gail. Viewing chores through Gail's eyes has helped Whirlpool introduce significant product enhancements.""<p>Having ""a ton of noobs"" would mean a ton of new customers that are paying you money to show you what is wrong with your product or service. They are a <i>great</i> resource to have, if you take advantage of them. If you can identify one problem that 35% of ""a ton of noobs"" all have in common, and if you can automate the solution to that problem (or make it significantly easier to solve), <i>then you have just achieved differentiation in a crowded market</i>.<p>Yes, it can be painful in the short term. You might have to hire some more help -- and you might have to streamline some of your other internal process, like your ticket system, which will also pay dividends in the future.<p>Avoiding pathological customers is certainly good advice for freelancers, consultants, and really small shops.

 * To find human-perspective dominant colors, it helps to throw out very-light/dark pixels.
 * Dribbble does a very good job of this - look at any of their individual photo pages.
 * For production use, C would be much more appropriate at solving this problem (but python is more fun to use).<p>Another cool application of color analysis like this:<p><a href=""http://www.vijayp.ca/blog/2012/06/colours-in-movie-posters-since-1914/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vijayp.ca/blog/2012/06/colours-in-movie-posters-s...</a>",1351113076

4695073,comment,4694204,4694808,7,0,anigbrowl,,,"Grand juries sit for months at a time, and a prosecutor has to bring cases before the grand jury before going to court. The grand jury decides if there is sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial. It's largely a formality. Essentially, the grand jury is there to answer the question of 'if these alleged facts are true, would that mean a crime has taken place?' Technically, the GJ's job is to find whether there is <i>probable cause</i> to issue an <i>indictment</i> and put someone on <i>trial</i>.<p>That's why you don't have a regular defense team there; the GJ isn't pronouncing on the guilt or innocence of the accused person, they're pronouncing on the gravity of the alleged offense. So if you're a prosecutor and you bring someone in front of a grand jury for murder, all you have to establish on a practical level is that a murder took place. You can learn more from the handbook for jurors: <a href=""http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/FederalCourts/Jury/grandhandbook2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/FederalCou...</a><p>There's no precrime involved here. A crime (vandalism of a federal court building) occurred in May, and it was brought before the grand jury that happened to be impanelled at that time, as one of the many cases they examine. It's not a conspiracy just because you don't know about it.",1351113022

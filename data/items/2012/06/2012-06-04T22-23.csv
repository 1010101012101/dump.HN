XP was plenty good for the vast majority of businesses and many of them are still running it because it works just fine.<p>I had the chance to play with a Windows 8 tablet and I have to say that was pretty impressive. The Metro interface works great in that environment.<p>My guess is that Microsoft will support Windows 7 for businesses for another decade. In the mean time, they are hoping to win the hearts and minds of people in the fast growing tablet and smartphone market.<p>I doubt they'll succeed, but they have to give it a shot.

4066402,comment,4064381,4064734,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>This is what Peter Thiel discusses in his ""perfect competition"" argument.</i><p>That's not Peter Thiel's argument. That's Peter Thiel delivering a remedial microeconomics lesson. 'Perfect competition', 'monopolistic competition' and 'monopoly' are technical terms which don't necessarily mean what they might appear to. In perfect competition, for example, all goods are fungible. It's a good model for the commodities market, since one barrel of oil is very much like another (there are different grades of oil with different sub-markets, such as 'Brent crude' or 'west Texas intermediate', but you don't care which particular company extracted which particular barrel of oil from the ground within a given market).<p>Now once you introduce the element of skill, you have something more like monopolistic competition. Pizzerias are in competition, and they're selling a similar product, but they can compete on everything from the quality of the pizza dough to the comfiness of the seating, so different customers may end up strongly preferring one to the other. Maybe I'm price-sensitive and prefer Mario's bargain slice, but you're a gourmet and you prefer Luigi's home-made flavor. Someone else prefers the fancy service at Gino's, and so on. This is why towns can have so many different restaurants and why supermarkets can sell multiple different brands of what are essentially similar products: you can differentiate products and services, and anchor consumers to a particular combination.<p><i>Sure a new business may add value by providing a better service than the competitor it beats, but the overall wealth pie of this nation doesn't increase.</i><p>Oh yes it does, because now the wealth is being allocated more efficiently. Commodities are one-size-fits-all, but relatively few goods are commodities. Consider, for example, that there are relatively few companies in the business of wheat production (commodity) but a great many different bread companies, in line with the wide variety of different bread products.<p>Please, pick up a microeconomics textbook. Macroeconomics is so flawed and obtuse that a lot of people dismiss the musings of economists, but microeconomics is a very robust discipline that is almost criminally underappreciated. If I could back to high school and give my teenage self some advice, it would be 'learn microeconomics.'",1338850457

4066374,comment,4063731,4065785,3,0,lambda,,,"(Trigger warning for anyone reading this comment: this comment discusses non-consensual sexual situations)<p>> Nope, but the sphere of influence of the conference organizer does.<p>Obviously, the conference organizer cannot determine whether someone can go to a particular bar at a particular time. However, the conference organizer can decide who can go to the conference. And that can be based on any judgment they want that they think is best for the conference, even based on what they have done outside of the conference. Remember, they are choosing who speaks at the conference based on things that happen outside of the conference; they are choosing based on whether the person has done good work in the past, or has something interesting to say. It's not like everything they do in organizing the conference is based solely on what happens in the conference.<p>It wouldn't be good if they banned people on just a personal whim. But having a policy about acceptable behavior, and applying that policy whether the behavior happens within the walls of the conference venue or not, is not unreasonable.<p>> I suppose so would paying a hooker and taking her back to your room or buying any number of drugs would fall under the convention organizers watchful eye as well? What about cheating on your significant other?<p>This is a different situation altogether. It doesn't make sense to decide one case on the basis of another, much more extreme, hypothetical case, that is completely unrelated. What happens at your hotel room is not the business of the conference; but if you have an ""unofficial post-conference after party"" that you announce on the conference notice board, and sexually harass someone there, then that does fall under the purview of the conference organizer. It's based on the association with the conference, the fact that the people were there together and interacting because of the conference, that makes it related to the conference.<p>>>we should probably try to do something
>This phrase never, ever prefaces the right course of action.<p>And that is just not true. If we decided to just give up any time an injustice happened, we would still be living in the dark ages. Sorry, there are plenty of times when it makes sense to make something our problem, to help defend the oppressed, defend minorities, prevent people from being dicks to each other and ruining a perfectly good conference.<p>Sure, it's possible to go from ""we should try to do something"" to a solution that is worse than the malady. I've seen that happen plenty, especially when things as heavy handed as the law are involved. But we're not asking someone to be locked up on just the say-so of one person. We are asking that <i>some kind of policy</i> be put into place on how to deal with sexual harassment at conferences and the possibly unofficial events associated with them.<p>> Sounds like a personal problem. One that should be handled personally, like, oh I don't know, choosing not to attend.<p>So you are saying that you would rather have people who sexually harass other people at the conference, than their victims? That because someone is the victim of sexual harassment and feels unsafe, that they should stop going to conferences? This is unacceptable.<p>Let me discuss something more personal, rather than talking about theoretical situations. I have been in a social group which admitted a man as a member who made many people feel uncomfortable. This was a social group, and it's not like people were offended by mere sexual jokes or people hitting on each other. He went further than that, saying things that creeped people out, not respecting people's personal space, not taking ""no"" for an answer when he went over the line. Several people brought up these problems, but no one did anything, in part because we had no formal policy for how to deal with this; once someone was a member of this group, there was nothing we could do.<p>Eventually, he wound up raping another member of the group. He went beyond mere creepiness to actual rape.<p>That is the kind of thing that women have to worry about when this sort of thing happens. It's not just something that makes them feel a little uncomfortable. If someone has demonstrated repeatedly that they don't respect boundaries and don't take ""no"" for an answer, they are at a much higher risk of going further. That's not so say that they will; you can't arrest someone for just creeping someone else out. But you can decide that that is not acceptable behavior for someone at your conference, or in your social group, or at your bar, and do something about it.<p>> You are now attempting to wield unrelated things as weapons against someone.<p>No one is trying to ""wield weapons"" at anyone else. They are not trying to punish. They are trying to keep the space safe for other people.<p>> In your example, and in the event in the blog post, the group that should be 'doing something' about it is the person impacted by it, not the convention organizers.<p>Look, conference organizers make all kinds of decisions to make their conference informative, useful, and welcoming. They are not obligated to allow anyone who applies to be a presenter. They are not obligated to allow anyone in the world to be an attendee. If someone is making other attendees seriously uncomfortable, then they are harming the conference, and it is well within the rights of the organizers to deny them access to the conference.<p>> Why stop at the conference, why not petition the airline not to sell this person a ticket? Or the hotel not to rent him a room? Or the rental car company not to loan him a car?<p>You are again extending the point beyond what anyone is arguing. You are building up a strawman, and shooting it down, not responding to what is actually being discussed.<p>The point of a conference it to get people together to discuss things. It cannot be very successful if people are afraid to come to it because someone else there makes them uncomfortable. I am not affected by someone I don't like renting a car from the same company that I rent it from. I am affected by them being at the same conference, especially if they seek me out even after I have told them to stop.<p>As for the plane example, again, it doesn't affect me if we are on different flights. But if the person sitting next to me started inappropriately hitting on me and failing to take ""no"" for an answer, I would take bring it to the attention of the flight crew. I would expect that they would ask the person to stop, and if they continued, would bar them from flying on the airline again, or (depending on how physical it got), land the plane early and have them arrested. No, I don't expect an airline to ban someone without a restraining order, but I would expect them to accommodate a request to change seats if I had been seated next to someone who had a history of harassing me.<p>And anyhow, that's neither here nor there. The point of an airline is to transport passengers. The point of a conference is to foster a community; for people to meet and share ideas. They are different purposes, and while in both cases people should feel like they have a recourse against sexual harassment, in the case of the conference, given that it is a much smaller, more intimate community, there is a much greater need to ensure that everyone feels safe and you are not simply allowing one person to scare others away.",1338850025

Regardless of what work his partner put in, Facebook is still owned by the flower shop entity, and each has ownership stakes as contractually or legally established. Neither Zuckerberg nor his partner would have any personal claim to Facebook, only to their equity in the owning entity. Zuck would not suddenly get more equity in the entity because of the work he did.<p>This is one of the most basic functions of equity and the reason for investing time or dollars in exchange for equity - so that your wealth increases disproportionately from the work of others. If ownership was determined by judges proportioning by sweat equity, those who left Facebook after 2 years and now have $10M+ would be in trouble.<p>There are numerous legal complications if Zuckerberg claimed that Facebook was NOT under the flower shop entity, however given your statement that he explicitly placed it under the flower shop, the case is quite simple. Zuck would not have been able to extract Facebook without buying out his partner.<p>I am way over my head in trying to get into this part, but depending on state law, I understand there are de facto partnership agreements in the absence of a written one (generally an equal split) and sometimes ways of getting rid of ""dead weight"" partnerships.

I know a number of folks who would call themselves a 'millionaire before taxes' which is to say their stock options would give them more than a million dollars when exercised, but since in California you end up withholding 51% for taxes you probably end up with less than a million.

Do some real design.<p>Consider a simple example - registering a user account.<p>Assume the product vision statement calls for a thick client desktop application that synchronises data to other desktop clients via a server. To use the sync service you need an account. On the client, you put up a form that asks the user for a user name and password. Easy. What happens when the call to the server is made to register that account?<p>Does the UI just lock up until the call returns? Does the UI remain responsive? Does a responsive UI allow the user to cancel the request? Is the technology chosen to build this thing even capable of asynchronous service calls?<p>When the data is sent over the wire, how is it protected? When it hits the server, how and where is the password stored? Is the request logged? Will server logs be of use to anyone? What error conditions are checked on the server, what corresponding messages are sent back to the client, and how are these communicated to the client? Is there a retry button the user can hit when it bombs? Should the client use a database/temporal cache/config file to store the user name and password in case the server is unreachable?<p>That was a <i>very simple</i> use case. [Edit] My point is that those questions demonstrate that the data model as well as the UI might  radically change based on other design decisions you should be making first. To answer those questions you need to do some design work.<p>Design work means analysis to get business, user, system, and operational requirements.<p>Then you need to think about availability, backup and recovery, capacity, communications, deployment, end user support, data migration, monitoring, performance, pilot program, security, system support.<p>It's called an architecture.<p>[Second edit] The agile police is probably going to jump on me for what I wrote.

Because most programmers are despite what they would say about themselves in public, actually stubborn language bigots? I would think about that because it puts functional programming (or logic programming (or proof-based programming (or stack-based programming))) at a disadvantage and a fair conclusion cannot be derived from uneven exposure.<p>Consider the actual research done in this area, classes have demonstrated that whatever the language, there is always the same distribution. Those that excel (small group), those that succeed through hard work and do good (most of the group) and those that just don't get it and fail (small group). This has been shown to be true for C, Visual Basic, Pascal, ML, LOGO, Scheme (SICP!) and even Coq!, which is a proof-assistant. Probably Prolog, too, but I haven't looked at that.

On top of that, the visual programming systems I've used (mostly Max and Synthmaker, but I've tinkered with one or two others too) have had far superior interactive environments than most textual programming languages. Personally, I find the Max environment much better than both the Python and Clojure REPLs (these are currently my two most used textual languages that support some form of interactive programming). Max also has a really convenient debugger which visually shows you how data flows through your program.<p>My ideal programming system would let you program in both textual and visual code interchangeably (and ideally let you convert one to the other at will).<p>As an aside, one observation I made when interactively programing in Max is that one of the things that I find most useful for experimentally developing is the ability not to name things. I find textual languages are pretty bad at this: you have to name functions, you have to name variables, you have to name structs/classes - in a visual language, you can usually leave things unnamed. While this would be bad practice in a finished program, it is incredibly convenient while you are trying out ideas before you've committed to a solution and the fact that you can visually see where the data flows, I find its nowhere near as confusing as, eg, anonymous functions or badly named variables in textual languages.<p>Having said all that, visual languages are far from perfect and are unlikely to ever replace textual languages, but I do believe that a visual language could be created that solves most of the problems with existing visual languages that would, for a large class of programs, be better suited than textual languages alone (certainly if, as I said above, you could mix and match visual and textual at will).",1338847671

The bigger problem imo is not the total amount of money, but all the strings it's come attached with, and in particular constantly-changing strings. If NASA got $17 billion and the freedom to decide how it should be best used to advance scientific goals, that would be one thing, but instead every President and Congress has their own pet ideas about what NASA should do with the money, and so it ends up getting allocated to a rotating parade of prestige projects that end up going nowhere.<p>On the latter point, I don't see NASA as really less efficient when they're given freedom over designs. They have some pretty impressive low-cost-satellite programs that teams of scientists have put together out of small bits of discretionary funds. And while StartX is impressive <i>for a private company</i>, I think it'll be some time before they're doing NASA-level work.

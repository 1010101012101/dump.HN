Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. all have Yama, which disables the ability for one process to access another&#x27;s process via ptrace or ptrace-equivalent mechanisms (like /proc/*/mem) without special permissions. OS X has no procfs, but the equivalent functionality, using task ports, has had similar restrictions since the 10.5 days -- see `man taskgated`. You can&#x27;t call task_for_pid() without having a particular code-signing entitlement or having administrator privileges.<p>This is why Xcode prompts you for administrator privileges when you first run it; gdb / lldb needs to be able to trace other processes and access their memory, and a normal process can&#x27;t do that.",1439769426

That&#x27;s where Tor seems headed, with ever better pluggable transports for bridges, and maybe even ephemeral website-like bridges from AWS etc.<p>But eventually, it may be necessary to get serious about steganography. With pervasive streaming HD video, covert channels providing even 0.1% of throughput would be workable. The harder challenge would be plausible deniability.

The USA was founded &quot;fresh&quot; as a place in which states had a measure of independence but ultimately formed a nation at a federal level.  That meant that it was in the nation&#x27;s self-interest to help out states that ran in to trouble--paying off debts, etc.--because helping a state out would help the nation succeed.<p>The EU was formed with the baggage of centuries of bloody warfare among nations of wildly different and opposing cultures.  I don&#x27;t think that kind of history--and more importantly, the fundamental differences in culture--can be shrugged off in the 50-odd years that the idea of the EU has been around.  It would seem that in practice, EU member nations are still very much about finger-pointing, and that can never lead to a successful federal bloc.<p>When a state goes bankrupt in the US, the other states pitch in at a federal level to solve the issue without divisiveness.

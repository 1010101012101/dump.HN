3509280,comment,3508698,3509077,25,0,_delirium,,,"<i>nowadays even the lower 10% have their basic needs covered and some left for leisure</i><p>Only really because of what's left of the welfare system, mainly Medicaid, Section 8 housing, food stamps, and the EITC; which I agree does help on the low end, but is increasingly being time-limited and rationed (e.g. Section 8 is hard to get into). The 10th-percentile household income in the U.S. is around $12,000. If that's all you had to live on, even in cheapish parts of the US it'd be quite a stretch to pay rent+food+transportation+healthcare out of that, especially for more than one person.<p><i>The problem is that a society where everybody have similar incomes is somehow fairer, when there is no logical chain leading there and to top it off it causes ruination.</i><p>Well, I've lived in both the U.S. and Denmark, which have very different levels of income inequality, and I wouldn't say Denmark has suffered ruination. There are pros and cons, of course. The logical chain isn't <i>that</i> complex if a society actually wants to implement it; it doesn't require some kind of communist revolution, just high and highly progressive taxes (including on capital gains), a national healthcare system, and a strong safety net.",1327488949

I remember reading a blog post from a FB employee (don't have the link at hand) saying that Google over-dramatized FB's willingness to go into search, be it ""social search"" or whatever. What brings people to FB, and more to the point, what makes them spending hours (literally) each day on that site is not their search feature (which I'd say is not that good) but the fact that everyone and everything  has a profile or a page or something (yes, maybe even the stray-dog from around my building's corner that a lot of my neighbors feed regularly - try creating a page for him on Google+).",1327488348

This require[d|s] a lot of finangling with the trusted certs on the device (usually burned in via firmware for older phones). I don't know anybody that does this today; I only list it here as a possibility.<p>2) Believe it or not, some older devices actually sent the mobile number as part of the HTTP headers originating from the device browser user-agent. For these devices, content sites using HTTPS connections were almost always guaranteed to receive the mobile number (the irony is rich). In these scenarios, carrier proxies would actually strip the mobile number or other identifying characteristics from the outbound HTTP requests.<p>3) More straight-forward, a bank installs a native user-agent on the device (e.g. banking app) that injects the mobile number after negotiating an e2e TLS tunnel.<p>#2 didn't admittedly answer your question, but I threw it in there for the sake of completeness.",1327487234

This is more work, but I think this will help humans understand what it does, and what it is supposed to do better as well.<p>And it would aid maintenance/refactoring. Behavior that is now implicit in the code would have to be written down explicitly (separating desirable behavior and side effects/bugs), and unlike ""design documents"" it is actually validated...

After all, there is a reason the Anabaptists fled the Bernese Emmental and journeyed to America.<p>Peasant revolts were brutally smashed.

But what if I'm just browsing a banks website thinking about opening an account?<p>Sorry I wasn't clearer. I was referring to the use-case where you have an HTTPS connection open with the banking site, and the carrier has agreed to send your mobile number to the banking site only under these conditions (perhaps for security/tracing/auditing purposes).<p>>Should they have my number then? (but of course banks are unlikely to abuse this for spam or anything.)<p>I'm not a carrier, but I'm pretty sure that we're on same page here when I say that ideally no egress HTTP request destined beyond/outside of the carrier network should contain a plaintext mobile number.<p>> But can you see how people would think this is a grey area with potential for abuse?<p>Yes. This is the same grey area with the potential for abuse that every single company must deal with whenever we hand them our personal information (Google, Facebook, etc).<p>> So basically, we just have to trust our carriers not to sell us out with no way of checking up on them?<p>I'm not sure why you're implying that I hold this opinion. It seems we're in violent agreement here.<p>EDIT: In essence, we <i>do</i> trust carriers not to sell our data and ""sell us out"" too much. Given the amount of personal data and habits that telecom companies have on us, I'm surprised that they haven't sold our records, logs and patterns to marketing firms. For all we know, they <i>might</i> be doing that already. </tinhat>",1327485616

I suppose you could take the center point between the two touches and expand on whichever icon that lands on (with boundaries of course; it would be strange if you pinched the edges of the screen and it expanded an icon in the center).<p>Another thing that&#x27;s bothering me about it being a two finger gesture is that the entire point of this feature idea is to be able to see things quickly at a glance.  I would imagine, then, that in these scenarios most people would be holding their iPhones with one hand and only touching the screen with one thumb.  This wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal on iPad, but I think it would be on iPhone.  That makes me feel more strongly that some kind of one finger gesture may be a better way to do this.<p>Other people in this thread have pointed out some good points too about discoverability: which apps support the feature?  How would the API be designed in a way that&#x27;s performance and power efficient?<p>This is definitely fun stuff to think about :)",1401476241

7823358,comment,7821808,7823066,2,0,will_brown,,,"In Florida we call this lapse, &quot;administrative dissolution for failure to file an annual report&quot;.  Alternatively, in Florida when you file articles of dissolution with the State it is called &quot;voluntary dissolution.&quot;  Each one has its own quirks, for example, if you are administratively dissolved the State grants a grace period reserving the name should you file a late annual report or reinstate.  After the grace period the company name will be up for grabs, and someone could take the name, but you would still be able to reinstate the company providing continuity.  If you voluntarily dissolve, Florida has a period of time you can revoke the voluntary dissolution, but after that grace period the old company if effectively gone and can not be reinstated.<p>Off the top of my head I could not point you to any resources that would suggest letting it lapse is the right thing to do.  Most attorneys by default will over look these nuances anyhow and always suggest the right thing to do is voluntarily dissolve. However, in private corporate legal practice I have seen the following scenarios where the voluntary dissolution has been problematic:<p>1.  If the company was not wound down properly, and assets are still in the company name, generally those assets may not be transferred out of a dissolved company, and if you do transfer assets out it would be legally invalid.  In such circumstances it would be better the company lapse, so it can be reinstated to transfer the assets lawfully;<p>2.  Another example I have seen first hand is in litigation.  In this instance a major oil company was sued by a number of gas station owners.  As you can imagine the oil company dragged this lawsuit out for decades.  By the time it was over many of the businesses that owned the gas stations sold and then dissolved.  Nevertheless, after the litigation they were entitled to large sums from the oil company.  For companies who administratively dissolved they could reinstate and have standing to collect their judgment, alternatively many of the business who voluntarily dissolved lost out on their portion of the judgement.<p>Best to consult an attorney to analyze your specific situation.",1401475887

Look at Chicago&#x27;s overly liberal justice system and how many of the shootings on the south and west sides are often from repeat offenders given slaps on the wrist for previous serious crimes.

From a practical pov, life is prison does the same thing, so I&#x27;m okay with getting rid of it. I think harsher sentences for violent crimes need to be in place and softer for non-violent crimes (drug use, possession, dealing).<p>Also, the cult of worshiping and pitying criminals is out of control. Not one mention of the victims, their names, how they spend their last minutes on earth, etc.  We know all the criminals and treat them as borderline celebrities but are quick to toss the victims down the memory hole.

The former of which requires heating SiC <i>until it metls at 2700C</i> and slowly pulling out a single perfect crystal cylindrical ingot.<p>Then you have the actual crystal growth portion where you shove all those wafers into an evacuated chamber, heat them to a thousand degrees, spin them around, and spray them toxic pyrophoric gases. This process takes multiple hours to grow just a few microns of light producing crystals.<p>Then you have to grind the wafers down to the appropriate die thickness, go through multiple stages of etching, add a phosphor for white LEDs, deposit gold and ITO for electrical contacts, and use lasers to cut them into individual die. Then, <i>finally</i>, you can ship them to the people in the linked article.

I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s been so much uptake in the Ruby/Python communities, which are very strong in those areas, but I guess Ruby/Python are now being used outside their original domains and those use-cases are pretty ripe for a language like Go.",1401472868

7823134,comment,7822912,7822912,3,0,jarrett,,,"I wonder if it would be possible to automatically flag ngrok sites for manual review based on certain criteria. E.g. if the phrase &quot;citibank&quot; appeared on the site, it would appear in a moderation queue.<p>Though there may be bulletproof ways for criminals to bypass such automatic scanning. For example, I&#x27;ve heard of criminals creating two versions of their site: One, a harmless site, that you get if you type in the domain name cold, and then a criminal one, that you only get if you have the right referrer header or query string. Which makes it difficult or impossible for an outside entity to see the illegal content without access to the spam email, referring site, or what have you.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about ngrok, but I take it you can tunnel SSL over it such that it&#x27;s impossible for ngrok to inspect the contents of your traffic. Which would rule another viable strategy: Monitor traffic for suspicious keywords, thus bypassing the cloaking techniques described above.<p>Any other techniques for automated flagging that I might be missing? Maybe some kind of content-agnostic traffic analysis that spots a likely spam fingerprint, e.g. certain chronological traffic patterns?",1401472826

It was meant to replace me. I figured that I knew enough programming by then to write a program that would take a spec and spit out another program.<p>Why it failed I&#x27;ll leave as an exercise to the reader (go build it!) but let&#x27;s say that 30 years later I&#x27;m not at all worried that programming will be dying as an art form any day soon. Because for that to happen we&#x27;d have to elevate computers to the levels of creative thinking normally reserved for us humans.<p>We can make tools to make it easier, ways that will afford us higher levels of abstraction using better programming languages. But those are mostly incremental steps, a better drill versus the previous generation drills.<p>And those tools will allow us to do more with less input from the programmers. But for now I don&#x27;t see any revolutionary development on the horizon other than quantum computing and practical implementation of those for general problems seems to be at least several decades out.",1401472806

They&#x27;re not persistent though - after a reboot, they&#x27;re gone.<p>In general:
Intel has the Management Engine, a separate processor running its own multi-MB firmware and is required (otherwise you&#x27;re system won&#x27;t run for very long) and Intel-signed (so you can&#x27;t replace it). It also has access to memory, USB, NIC and certain control over the CPU.<p>When it comes to your mechanisms, my guess is #4, but probably entering System Management Mode or Trusted Execution Mode (on TXT systems) - there are some things you can&#x27;t access from ring 0.<p>As for hiding within the instruction set, x86 has prefixes and I doubt anyone tried redundant ones on all kinds of opcodes: something like &quot;LOCK LOCK REPNE DATA32 DATA32 LOCK ADDR32 MOV $entrypoint, dr0;&quot; might just do the trick. Or simply a long chain of non-sensical prefixes after which the CPU just expects a magic value and the entry point... x86 is known to accept 14 bytes of prefixes, so there&#x27;s some space to hide special behaviour.",1375462683

6148122,comment,6146998,6146998,1,0,lucgommans,,,"I&#x27;ve actually written an article about this for the Dutch website security.nl two weeks ago. Looking at the facts alone, I find it far-fetched but most certainly feasible and it should be considered a possibility. So I disagree with anyone saying it&#x27;s totally infeasible, but I&#x27;m skeptical about whether they really did go through the effort of doing this.<p>Dutch article: <a href=""https://www.security.nl/artikel/47135/1/De_onzichtbare_backdoor%3A_een_voorspelbare_PRNG_in_de_CPU.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.security.nl/artikel/47135/1/De_onzichtbare_backd...</a><p>English summary:<p>Intel included a new CPU instruction called RdRand as of their Ivy Bridge architecture. This RdRand instruction produces random numbers generated by the chip itself. However the issue with this kind of random number generation, especially since Intel says it&#x27;s cryptographically secure, is that it can not be audited or verified. Sure we can run statistical analysis on it, but we cannot tell the difference between true randomness and the output of AES-CBC. Nowadays the output is mixed with the existing entropy sources in Linux, but in closed source systems such as Windows and OS X we don&#x27;t know how RdRand&#x27;s output is used.<p>I also mention the potential consequences of such a bug, which are rather wide-ranging. If RdRand&#x27;s output is used directly then we can assume: if you have an Ivy Bridge CPU or newer, all your ssl/tls traffic can be decrypted (it needs randomness to setup a session). If the server that generated the private key was Ivy Bridge or newer, all traffic to and from that server can be forged. Furthermore, things like TCP sequence numbers or DNS source port numbers could be predicted, allowing offensive capabilities as well as passive cracking of our traffic.<p>Again, I&#x27;m personally skeptical about all of this, but the potential consequences are quite bad, and it&#x27;s not all that hard to hide their tracks... I can provide a theoretical proof of concept on demand. The only thing I have to guess at is whether the CPU can maintain a state between power cycles, that question is best left for others to answer. It would not have to be large though, a few bytes is all it takes.",1375462608

I imagine intelligence agencies in countries which are not huge fans of the US would have every incentive to do this. They might not be able to figure out the mechanism (i.e. access the backdoor), but they would obviously try to work on processors that aren&#x27;t compromised, which might be noticeable (Loongson?) or they could simply reveal this knowledge to embarrass the United States, and it would certainly cause some political backlash if confirmed.

We&#x27;re all familiar with the argument that the government will not disclose a hidden surveillance mechanism to catch a target that isn&#x27;t &quot;worth it&quot; relative to the loss of secrecy, but if a suspected (however weak those suspicions may be) Iranian nuclear weapons program isn&#x27;t worth it, then what, precisely, is?<p>Furthermore, is it politically feasible? The government has already seen leaks by the likes of Snowden and Manning, and this development would require even more time and effort and cooperation across teams of people who may not be entirely supportive of the far-ranging surveillance this would imply.

6148065,comment,6146579,6147461,1,0,slgeorge,,,"&quot;Canonical does its best to bring closed-source commercial desktop applications to the operating system through the Ubuntu app store. With good reason: they know the developers of these commercial applications will only target Ubuntu, since unlike open source programs where the distributions packagers do the work of bringing your application to their OS for you, that cant be done very well with just binary packages compiled against x version of y library. Thus forcing users who want to use one of these applications to switch to Ubuntu.&quot;<p>First, I drove the App Store both strategy and was responsible for development - in other words _I know_ why we did it. I am my own citation!<p>Strategically, what do you think the biggest reason is for why end-users don&#x27;t move across platforms? Guess what it&#x27;s application software, specifically lack of important application classes and brand names end-users are familiar with. It comes across in all the user-research. So, what you want to do is to encourage commercial software developers and prove out a market - which leads to a situation where familiar applications are available on an unfamiliar platform.<p>Guess what the other problem is in the Linux ecosystem compared to other &#x27;alternative platform&#x27; ecosystems - the lack of a set of commercial software developers. Think back to Apple in the mid-90&#x27;s a period where the media thought they &quot;were dead&quot;. They could still attract thousands of developers to MacWorlds and there were lots of software companies developing great software for users of the platform. Desktop Linux doesn&#x27;t have that because it never created a market. The result is not as much fully polished, long-term end-user grade software.<p>So finding a way to create a market place and create the ability for commercial software developers to target the platform is good for end-users. That&#x27;s the strategic reasoning.<p>Next, consider the problems that developers face.<p>If you go to some conferences and ask developers why they don&#x27;t target Linux - go ask at some Game developers conferences - they&#x27;ll tell you two things a) Linux users don&#x27;t pay for anything/market is too small b) developing for Linux is too hard. Now a) is just a hard problem and the only thing that changes is it is time. But, when you dig into b) what you discover they mean is that the development tools on Linux are hard and that the swathe of packaging options is confusing. Which is exactly why Ubuntu started cutting through the &quot;tyranny of choice&quot; to provide information on how to develop/port - see <a href=""http://developer.ubuntu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.ubuntu.com</a> . It&#x27;s also why we reduced the complexity of packaging, provided tools and a web portal which is what developers are used to on other platforms - now a developer just has to use the autopackaging tool and the system takes care of the rest of it.<p>Result is that there are more commercial applications available on a desktop Linux (Ubuntu) than every before. Result, some of the commercial tool developers are targeting a Linux desktop in a way never done before. I&#x27;m proud of that. And, since by definition it&#x27;s easier to port from one distribution of Linux than it is to port from another platform to Linux - you should be proud of that as well.<p>Either way, that&#x27;s the _facts_ on _why_ Ubuntu targets developers and full explanation of how it&#x27;s not an evil genius plan.",1375462085

The power of those tools isnt in a particular executable, its in the algorithms they embody. For example, it is useful to compare two text streams reasonably efficiently and identify differences. How those differences are then presented obviously matters, but if youve got the algorithms and the ideas underlying them, producing a new tool to apply those ideas in a different context is the easy part.<p>The only significant difference I see is that if you made a major change, for example adopting a more structured storage model or using some sort of action/history analysis to better capture a programmers intent, then you would have more data to use in your algorithms, and you might therefore be able to present more interesting results.<p><i>Have you read TAOUP? Do you understand the extent of the power that existing text tooling gives us today? Are you experienced in the advanced use of the existing tools, so you are able to make comparisons about their power?</i><p>Yes, though I find your emphasis on that one book a little surprising. For one thing, the UNIX philosophy was established for decades before Raymond wrote that particular work. For another, I seem to recall that he gives examples of both text and binary formats being useful in the book. I dont think his point was that text formats were good and non-text ones bad; I think he was arguing that things like adaptability and composability were good and that flexible and standardised formats helped to achieve those things.<p><i>We move forward when people show how it can be done.</i><p>Right, so why arent the programming language community picking up on decades of research and industrial progress with databases and HCI? Programming languages and the related tools are, fundamentally, just a user interface to design and control a complex, highly structured set of data.<p><i>Please show us how we can improve diffs, patches and merges by moving to semantic data structures over text, without compromising any existing capabilities.</i><p>Youre begging the question, by starting from the position that having an equivalent to todays text-based diffs, patches and merge tools is desirable. I dont think that is necessarily true.<p>As a programmer, I want to be able to specify how my software should work, and I want to be able to explore and modify that specification effectively, and I need to be able to do these things in collaboration with others. My claim is that to do those things <i>much</i> better than we do them today, we may need to move to a different representation than freeform text and then build new tools that are designed to solve our problems in terms of that new representation.<p>The problem is that there is so much momentum behind text-based formats today that we are effectively stuck around a local maximum. No one individual could possibly meet your challenge today, and Im sure you were well aware of that when you made it. That doesnt mean the community as a whole couldnt do it, but it would need some serious collaboration, which realistically means one of the heavyweight organisations with the resources to bootstrap a whole new software development ecosystem would need to throw its weight behind such a project. Unfortunately, most if not all such organisations are commercial in nature, and the commercial incentives dont align with moving in that direction.",1375461795

6148023,comment,6147272,6147272,1,0,dBlisse,,,"Tabs are an extremely poor way of managing your space. In this case, your space is your screen.<p>The issue with tabs is that once you are past 10, you are significantly degrading the readability of your content. In order to reference &#x27;x&#x27; material, you have to parse through all your tabs until you find the right one. This is a valuable waste of time and energy.<p>Over the last year I&#x27;ve slowly moved towards finding a solution to the tabbing dilemma, and how to actually have a huge number of different windows open, and I found it&#x27;s already been solved. Workspaces.<p>If you&#x27;ve used a Macbook, you probably found out about 4 finger swiping, which switches between different &#x27;workspaces&#x27;, different, full-sized screens.<p>Similarly, on Linux distros, workspaces are usually enabled by default, and accessed via CTRL+ALT+ARROW_KEY.<p>On Windows, I found the free program Dexpot to be similarly as useful, except that the swapping is definitely not as smooth as on Linux/Mac.<p>The main benefit of workspaces is literally to section off your activities according to workspaces. For example, I will have a text editor open in one workspace, and a terminal open in another. I swap to one to compile, I swap to another to write.<p>I will then have several workspaces of pure reference material. C++ documentation, other specific documentation, random .pdf files, stackoverflow on Chrome and similar things.<p>And finally I&#x27;ll have another workspace that&#x27;s more of a play/irrelevant to activity theme. This way, tabs don&#x27;t really build up (30+) unless I explicitly ignore the way my workflow is designed. This has been part of my evolution from Bookmarks to Hotkeys to now, efficient workspaces. I&#x27;m working on Macros.<p>However, for casual business, I&#x27;ll usually have 20+ tabs open. :p",1375461675

My implication is that social cohesion policies are not easy when you have a ethically diverse population with different cultures and values.  It&#x27;s perfectly natural for people to form into groups and not trust &#x27;others&#x27; (which isn&#x27;t racist).  This natural tendency makes it hard for social policies to be successful.   When 95% of your population is white, with similar cultural values, its easy to have a policy where you spread the wealth to fellow group members you identify with.  It&#x27;s a lot harder to have policies when your population is split into 3 different camps.",1375461084

Most HNers work for pretty cool companies, but even then how many would face repercussions if they took the day off to burn tires in the street? Also this type of serious protest you discuss does happen for just a day, but maybe weeks (or longer). Many HNers would definitely face employment concerns if they took weeks off to protest, and most people outside the tech community would be fired/seriously repremanded as the employer/employee balance of power is extremely imbalanced right now.<p>The surveillance state is, imho, one of the greatest existential threats to individual freedom in the history of the US, but for anyone looking at the risk calculus its still a future threat: today you have tons of food, entertainment, a place to live and most people dont actually feel the affects of the shrinking limitations on freedom (in fact the only people who do are those who are fighting against this changes, another point in favor of not protesting from the pov of risk).<p>So the calculus of pleasure means for most people protest is more painful than the current state of things. But theres also the pain factor. Most Americans are aware of the incarceration rate of the US. Were also aware of the terrible conditions in US prisons.  We know the fate that became Manning, can only imagine what will happen to Snowden and under the current administration US citizens have even been targeted for assassination (no due process involved).  Not only is there a threat of reduced pleasure to consider, you really, really dont want to face punishment at the hands of the US government.<p>Finally theres the completely uninteresting but real problem of geolocation: The US is a huge country, where are we going to meet? Even in DC today most protester are actually hired to protest, they arent concerned citizens but paid by a group of concerned citizens to protest in a formulaic and safe way.<p>Assaults on American freedoms are being extracted in such a brilliant way that pleasure/pain calculus wont sway in favor of massive protest and unrest until the government has such power that such protests can be squashed before their inception (this is exactly why the surveillance state is so dangerous).<p>But please dont turn your anger inward or towards other Americans: learn about tools that can fight the surveillance state (legal and technical), start small community discussion about these topics, and continue to fund organizations that are fighting for your rights in these domain.

They make a CPU that always executes instructions in exactly the correct way, except that if certain registers are filled with precisely specific data, the CPU turns of protection and suddenly jumps into whatever is pointed by one of the registers. Then target a network packet handling routine with that -- so if a specific malformed packet is received, the cpu jumps into the data payload. If your magic data is long enough (4 32-bit registers would be enough), no-one will ever trigger it by accident.<p>Doing this would be trivial with the microcode in modern x86 cpus, and while it would break (no longer trigger) if the netcode is updated (or even recompiled), that&#x27;s rather rare, and cpu ucode can be updated too.",1375460268

I don&#x27;t mean this as an appeal to authority, but, since people are attacking Steve Blank&#x27;s background, I used to design CPUs, and I&#x27;ve done pretty much everything except low-level stuff like layout (which I only did in classes).<p>I have no opinion on whether or not there is a backdoor, but, here are some possible mechanisms.<p>1. Periodic SMI on steroids. Intel used to have a debug mode based on an SMI++ like mode, where the chip would periodically dump the entire state of the machine out to memory. That&#x27;s not nearly as useful for debugging now as it was 15 years ago, but it could dump out compromising information to some buffer that your network card DMAs out.<p>2. RNG weakness.<p>3. Put the machine into ring 0, with no other changes.<p>4. Put the machine into ring 0, while transferring control to some address.<p>5. Access to the microcode patch mechanism.<p>It took me about 15 seconds to come up with those ideas (I thought of 4 when I wrote down 3). Regardless of what you think of the NSA, they have the of the best security people in the world. They can probably figure something out.<p>Any of these things could easily be triggered by a sequence of obscure instructions. There are plenty of userland instructions that are never used today. An arbitrary sequence of, say, 20 of them is likely to never be discovered even by brute force attack. If you&#x27;re really worried, you can load up a few registers with some specific values, and now you&#x27;ve got a 192-bit keysize (or more, if you want).<p>If you want to keep it secret from the companies themselves, you&#x27;re probably better off using a secret register key in some microcode instruction, since that would be relatively easy to surreptitiously sneak in after the official tapeout. Looking for a sequence of instructions wouldn&#x27;t be technically difficult (I doubt the decoder/translator is on the critical path, but, Intel&#x27;s might be custom, in which case it would be a lot of work to find spare space), but, it would be more work to sneak it in seamlessly. Then again, they almost certainly have free gates lying around so that post-silicon bugs don&#x27;t require a full-layer tapeout to fix. You could write a program that edits the right mask layers to access those and patch your change in. But, if those actually get used for debug purposes, you&#x27;d lose the ability to make the change seamlessly, and, it&#x27;s much more work than the first approach.<p>I suspect &#x27;5&#x27; would require restarting the machine, although you could design a mechanism that lets you hot-swap microcode. Doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, though, considering how easy it is to compromise a machine if you control the hardware.",1375460266

They paid me $4.25 to fill out a signup form on their site (first name, last name, email, gender, interested-in, location).

However, people abuse this setup by misleading clicks/signups.<p>People abuse it through many different ways. The most notorious is Jenny&#x27;s Diet Blog. An affiliate marketer made a fake blog about &quot;Jenny&quot; and her diet &quot;miracle&quot;, espousing the ease of losing weight through acai berry and colon cleaning product free trials. The affiliate was paid ~$40 per signup for each.<p>The abuse is through misleading ads, outright lying on web pages, scammy merchants (they are just as bad) and more.<p>> Is this an accurate summary?<p>You definitely are on the right track.<p>> Edit: Also, how does one learn about these affiliate programs?

Hell, a simple talk to our own parents (mine&#x27;re 50+, somewhat tech inclined but nothing deeper than the basic word editing, and web browsing) in relation to this reveals that they think &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t tell your secret to the whole internet&quot;, little realizing that publishing it will actually help you plug the holes.<p>The problem is, as long as it was a physical object it was all fine, sort of atleast. You could put anti tamper mechanism (like safes with relockers) that would destroy the core technology/secret if someone tries to pry it apart. But with computer code and mathematics, it&#x27;s guaranteed that the attacker/pryer is able to make millions of duplicates at zero extra cost. So if approach #564 doesn&#x27;t work, all he has to do is cp ../downloads/file ../project/reverseengineer/ and boom he has another copy to work with.<p>The only thing holding an intruder out of a system is the solidity of the mathematical concept that system is based on. And now that the intruder <i>knows</i> that there&#x27;s a break, and that he potentially will gain a lot by discovering it, he can continue unhindered.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m preaching to the choir, but if you&#x27;ve encountered such people you should give this analogy. In the real world, the guy needs to buy your widget each time he fails to reverse-engineer the anti-intrusion mechanism, but if he were able to make a 100% replica copy of the widget and work on that copy he could try everything. So if he fails once, he&#x27;ll just make another copy and try a new approach at opening your widget. He knows it&#x27;s broken, and there&#x27;s no real extra &quot;cost&quot; associated with duplicating the widget to try again, there&#x27;s literally no stopping him until he gives up.<p>Another thing that crossed my mind was this. The manufacturers would want to keep this knowledge (i.e. that the exploit exists) secret, but ~~if~~ when he discovers the backdoor, do you want to be considered responsible for your car being stolen instead of the manufacturer for the manufacturer&#x27;s mistake? Would you not prefer that the manufacturer calls you and recalls your car to the garage and replace it with a better part? It&#x27;s a shame because Bentleys, Porsches, and Audis are NOT cheap.

Regardless of comment support in JSON the same problem appears to exist.",1375459306

I am new to python/django and am planning to use some of these code-review points to better understand django as well as my project rather than &#x27;review&#x27; it as such.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about using excel to track the project layout, though I&#x27;m not sure what tool would I use for such a task. My current method of rapidly using my IDE to traverse between files while building a mental model in my mind is effective but I can retain only about 50% of the information in a week or two.<p>What do others do?",1375459300

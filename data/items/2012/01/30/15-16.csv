If it's the case, at some point people will need to compose apps in new, creative ways that suit their particular individual goal, which no one else has currently thought of to implement in a single one-click app (if it's even possible) and/or which an app that's almost there can't go the rest of the way because the request is too specific to that one user.<p>Of course, I'm more in favor of using the same simple argument made when students ask why they must learn algebra.

3529231,comment,3529045,3529108,4,0,B0Z,,,"One of the things The Securities Act of '33 was established to do was to protect the general public from themselves and from predatory brokers who were loaning a generally ignorant public caught up in speculative bubbles. Brokers were lending people up to 2/3rds of the face value of stock they were purchasing. When the market started to get cold feet and rumors ran rampant, people were selling every stock they owned just to cover the amount they were leveraged.<p>I haven't read the bill before Congress, but I would think if there are provisions that prohibit borrowing as a mechanism for financing stock purchases, this would benefit the start up ecosystem. The system in it's current state only benefits the very, very wealthy, and forces young start ups into term negotiations with people who do it for a living.<p>Methinks there is / will be heavy lobbying on behalf of the major investment banks who would naturally oppose any new members in their club.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_1929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_1929</a>",1327939058

If your integration tests are sufficiently integration-y, often this slowness directly reflects the fact that your system is slow to the users as well!<p>Or, failing that, that you've got too many dependencies hardwired into your system, or some other real problem.<p>Following up on my other proximal post here, the question is ultimate not whether it's high or low level, it's whether it's fast or slow, period. I've written slow low-level tests because they fully tested a 10x10x10x10x10x10 state space accidentally, I've written (after some work on the underlying system) some very fast tests that literally simulate user input to the system via the web server at the highest possible level.<p>The real key is that you can't really follow a testing recipe, you always have to be looking out for the cost-benefits. I suspect the other key is that you must come to internalize the idea that automated testing is <i>really important</i> and if that means spending a man-week to improve your testing environment is what you need to do, then do it.

If you're concerned about your safety or enjoyment while you're here, that's fine, but I wouldn't boycott the US to make a political statement.  The strange minority of Americans who don't understand freedom aren't gonna get the message.  Your boycott is gonna hurt the Americans who most want our country to be a diverse, welcoming place.<p>I highly recommend San Francisco in particular.  We have a decent sized French expat population, and the city is fairly multi-cultural and liberal, even by European standards, I think.

3529227,comment,3528138,3528524,8,0,nkoren,,,"Same story here. Left in 2007, and no longer have any desire to return. My last visit, in 2010, left quite a bad taste in my mouth, with the creeping totalitarianism on display at the airports in particular. Welcome to America: don't forget that WE ARE ALWAYS WATCHING YOU.<p>What's especially depressing is that the commitment to paranoia and the dismantling of due process, civil rights, etc., is 100% bipartisan; there are no serious political voices taking a stand against it. Bush was of course bad; Obama -- my last great hope -- has extended and amplified everything that Bush did. And Obama's opponents are essentially unified in their position that Obama's chief failure has been to not dismantle due process and civil rights <i>quickly enough</i>. At this point, I think that Obama is probably still the lesser evil, but that's too damned evil for me to vote for.<p>I don't see any prospects for this reversing itself. Carry this trend out another decade or two, and it means the end of the American republic. There's nothing extraordinary about this thought: over long enough timeframes, great nations collapse <i>all the time</i>, and this is more or less the blueprint they follow when they do it: increasing paranoia about being beset by enemies both external and domestic; dismantling of internal political apparatus and centralisation of political power with a single individual; increasing inability to balance a budget, tolerate dissent, maintain infrastructure, etc. I fear that the present era will be remembered alongside Rome in the late 4th century, Spain in the early 1930s, etc.<p>I hope I'm wrong, and that those who stay can somehow turn it around.

It's just ""automated tests"". People seem to be very prone in getting caught up in the question of whether it's a ""unit"" or ""acceptance"" or ""integration"" test when that's a completely uninteresting question.<p>Even ""Test what, not how"" is only a rule of thumb; if I've got a complicated ""what"", I'll sometimes at least <i>probe</i> the implementation to be sure I'm on the right track during development. Of course, if I change the ""what"" I just nuke them. I say this having done this entire cycle over the last week. My ""what"" was too slow and I need a new ""what"", but unit testing the ""what"" helped me get it to the point where I could benchmark it much faster than if I had tried to ""not test the what"". (Sometimes, you can also nuke the ""what"" tests before putting them into long-term storage.)<p>If you can avoid getting caught up in attaching goodness and badness to the terms, unit/acceptance/integration can still be useful communication terms, but I resist using them for anything else, and I don't personally use them at all.<p>(Also, to be clear, I consider this amplification or reflection upon your post, not disagreement.)",1327938707

I started at a state school and left school for a long time then wound up finishing my degree years later at a private school that is focused on getting students to their degree. As such my educational path felt very industrial. I learned a lot of things about different subject but it was all raw education and not experiences which I think the latter are more valuable. This was mainly due to the environment, had I been in an environment like MIT I probably would not have had the gap. What really burns my ass now is that I have a lot of peers from MIT and I get so aggravated when they say, man you would have had so much fun at MIT you would have fit right in. It bothers me because I know I missed a lot of great opportunities and experiences. On the converse side of it is though, at the time I first went to school, I went to LSU because it was a party school. Which is what made it attractive to me, at the time. If I would have went to MIT at that point in my life I don't know that I would have been able to exploit the benefit of being their. Point being make sure you are going to school for the right reasons or your are just wasting time.<p>That being said, I did not grow up in an environment that promoted entrepreneurship. My family was farmers, commercial fishermen, and mechanics. In this environment there is not a lot of encouragement for starting a business. So the idea never dawned on me until I was well into my 20's and had some experience in the world. I had to learn that other people just like me where doing it, before I ever got the idea that I could do it too. It should stupid, but when you grow up in an environment like that, it is true that it never dawns on you. Not to say that it was a bad environment, in many ways it was awesome growing up on a farm. Anyways, the point being, if I would have had a venture that I wanted to do back in those days, I would have forgone college and used the money to start a venture.

Over the years there has been a set of people who reliably criticize academic writers who write in an informal manner on their blogs. The economist Paul Krugman gets this kind of criticism a lot -- that is his blog is not sufficiently formal for someone who has won a Nobel prize. All the same, danah boyd explained her reasoning before, on the matter of informality and blog writing. This is what she wrote (several paragraphs):<p>I'm an academic but I'm also a blogger. For me, these are separate identities. I write formal papers that I spend months trying to find the language to properly express what's going on. In those papers, I try to balance precision and readability. My blog is a different story. I write in an off-the-cuff manner, trying to paint impressions rather than nuance. In academic writing, I have to outline methodology and background, assuming that no one has heard of me or the topic before. In my blog, I write with the assumption that people are familiar with my work and with the topic. In academic writing, I write for posterity. In my blog, I write to get an issue off my chest and to work things out while they are still raw.<p>The informal language in my blog is intentional. The lack of citations is intentional. They are meant to signal that this is a work-in-progress. I want to signal that I'm thinking out loud. Unfortunately, many feel as though a blog must be formal and then they project this view onto my writing and then complain about the language and the lack of cites. I am capable of situating arguments in broader theoretical arguments, but I don't attempt to do that here while I'm working through things. I guess my signals are broken.<p>The blog structure is not built for long essays. My blog itself is not formatted to take on a 3000 word essay (it breaks). When I started publishing conference cribs, I started making them separate webpages that I would link to from Apophenia and M2M. Following that, whenever I'd write a blog entry that was longer than 2000 words, I'd shove it off to the same messy directory with my papers and my cribs and link to it from my blog. They're all under the /papers directory simply because I started keeping track of things at the papers URL. You can see more than papers there. I started sub-directorying it a few months ago because it was getting messy. Essays are exactly that and the class piece was an essay.<p>I added citations to everything under that directory because I was finding that people were taking that material out of context. They were copying/pasting the whole article without reference to where it came from because it looked like it stood on its own (folks didn't do that with my blog entries). I wanted people to know the context so all essays, cribs, op-eds, and papers got tagged with a citation. Unfortunately, this meant that people thought that it was a proper paper.<p><a href=""http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ResponseToClassDivisions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ResponseToClassDivisions....</a>",1327936122

And I also I am not affected by other people's opinions. Those two have nothing in common. Me being an introvert is not responsible for this.<p>I also have a lot of friends and by all objective measures am very social. But after a lot of very fun and enjoyable social interaction I feel mentally tired and need alone time to recharge. That is ALL that introversion is.<p>Extroversion on the other hand means you feel invigorated after social interaction.<p>This has nothing to do with approval seeking behavior which is an entirely separate personality trait, which can be found in both extroverts and introverts.",1327936085

German grammar is way more complex than Chinese's, but because of the etymological closeness between German and English, the German student will quickly get to the point where they can easily pick up new words from the context (obviating the need for vocabulary lists), while the Chinese student will pretty much never reach that. In this type of situation an SRS is invaluable.<p>Regarding multiplication tables, you shouldn't forget that knowing them by heart is sometimes necessary for understanding the exciting problems.

The only way I can imagine that happening is if you are an introvert who happens to be a professional party host, or maybe sales.

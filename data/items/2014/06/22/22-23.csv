7929466,story,,,1,2,curiousgeorgio,"$20M proof that the U.S. government doesn't understand incentives",,"Many of you will already be aware of this, so it&#x27;ll come at no surprise. Recently, I received a packet in the mail from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The cover page explained that since I purchased a home in 2013, I was being asked to complete a survey about my experience regarding the mortgage application process.<p>Then I noticed a five dollar bill folded around the survey. Awesome!<p>Yes, $5 is small - so small it&#x27;s practically insignificant. But then I decided to check some numbers.<p>According to census.gov, over 5 million homes were sold in 2013. Even if we account for 20% of home sales not using a mortgage/loan, that&#x27;s still roughly $20 million potentially spent for this &quot;small token of appreciation”.<p>But that&#x27;s not what infuriates me. After all, $20 million is practically a rounding error in light of the U.S. government&#x27;s total annual spending.<p>The thing that gets me is the fact that the cash is given <i>before</i> you do anything in response. Why would any rational human fill out the lengthy survey (which offers no further reward or even chance of reward) when the &quot;reward&quot; is given - either way - upfront?<p>What rational, competitive company would use this strategy (giving away money with absolutely no commitment or effort required) to somehow encourage customer response?<p>To be honest, I actually would have felt slightly more inclined to fill out the survey if no money had been included at all - merely out of a sense of respect for my country. Instead, the money is just a slap in the face and a proof of ineptitude by those sending it out.<p>It proves to me that the people running this show have no competency when it comes to incentivizing behavior.<p>And then there&#x27;s the irony of this coming from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<p>(full text at http://pastebin.com/r7ZkeGbz)",1403476977

7929456,comment,7922266,7926769,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Here&#x27;s another way to think about this: imagine you invented the lever. The thing that allows you to move heavy objects you could not before, is the prior art of a log and a rock. The beam-and-fulcrum arrangement &quot;only&quot; tells the rock and log what to do.<p>I found a small rock and a stick and I told them to move a big rock but nothing happened. I think you need to do something more than communicate information to them to get them to produce leverage.<p>That&#x27;s the fundamental difference with software. A computer takes an algorithm and an input and produces an output. For example, you might take an image decompression algorithm and a compressed image and produce raw pixel values. The important fact is that the algorithm <i>and</i> the compressed image <i>and</i> the uncompressed image are all purely information. It&#x27;s the difference between knowing something and doing something. Computers cause information to be created, but information is not supposed to be patentable, and there is nothing else there to patent other than information.<p>> Non sequitur. Anything can be abstracted to an arbitrary degree. A very specific type of a screw with a very exact shape made of a very specific alloy can be abstractly defined as a &quot;fastening component.&quot; That does not mean nothing is patentable.<p>No, but what it means is that if you&#x27;re going to say &quot;fastening component&quot; instead of providing anything more specific, that should not be the only part of your claim directed to patentable subject matter.<p>> My point was precisely that the &quot;abstract&quot; that the court has in mind is very different from the &quot;abstract&quot; that we have in mind when talking about algorithms.<p>Even if that were true I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to prove. Algorithms are all different kinds of abstract. And as soon as you make them specific you&#x27;re straight into mathematical formulas and laws of nature.",1403476594

Referring to “Dani” and “she” in these articles would be confusing to the reader and at least at some level anachronistic, opposed to the consensus reality shared by everyone around her. I understand that this decision may not seem ideal to everyone, and even that it runs counter to some journalistic style guidelines. If you disagree with it, I can only ask you to believe me when I say it was made in good faith, with no intention to slight.

Calming your nerves is a very common problem, and can be challenging to overcome.  It sounds like your problem is not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of delivery.  Here are a few immediate things to try:<p>- Practice makes perfect:  find someone to give you a mock interview.  Do this as often as necessary until you conquer your problem.\n- Caffeine, adderall, etc, can make you much more anxious.  You need to be calm.\n- Don&#x27;t feel pressure/rushed, and <i>don&#x27;t panic</i>.  Slow down. If your mind races under pressure, that&#x27;s completely normal, but it can be controlled.\n- Its ok to not entirely know the answer.  Start by responding with what you do know.  Once you begin speaking, the ideas will start flowing.  Many technical questions are &quot;loaded&quot;.  To actually solve the problem in the best way possible, you need <i>way</i> more information than they give you.  This will cause your mind to race.  Try to qualify your response with your thought process, &quot;if this or this, I&#x27;d do this.  If something or another, I&#x27;d probably do this.&quot;\n- Practice speaking with confidence.  Take a deep breath, all the way down into your belly, and then use that air pressure to make your vocal chords &quot;sing&quot;.  Having a strong vocal tonality will resonate confidence inside your head, and inside theirs.  Also, don&#x27;t be monotone/boring.  Find/express energy and enthusiasm without sounding fake or cheesy.<p>Being nervous for an interview is normal.  I&#x27;ve interviewed a lot, and I always get nervous.  Its just something you have to deal with.  Public speakers and pick up artists (approaching women to ask them out) are two areas that you can find a <i>ton</i> of advice for calming your nerves.<p>Introverts can have a hard time finding their inner personality.  Practice makes perfect.  Try to start as many conversations as you can each day.  Don&#x27;t force it, become natural at engaging conversations with other people.

Even if the goal is not realistically attainable, it shows you exactly where you stand.<p>Let&#x27;s say you think $1M is good enough for your notion of financial independence. Well, how can you accumulate that amount in 20 years? One way would be to invest $2750/month. If you can manage an average annual return of 4%, you&#x27;ll hit the $1M mark right after 20 years. If you start at 25 (giving you a buffer period after college to grow some roots), you&#x27;ll be good by the time you&#x27;re 45.<p>Note that in this case, &quot;financial independence&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to mean that you&#x27;re wealthy enough to live your picture perfect life without ever working a day again.

If you can find one, I&#x27;ll show you one that should be chucked in with perpetual motion machines.<p>Obviously a patent on a solution to the halting problem is fraudulent, but you have the issue reversed. It isn&#x27;t that you can&#x27;t use a machine to execute an algorithm, it&#x27;s that you can execute an algorithm without a machine. The machine isn&#x27;t a necessary component, it&#x27;s just a convenient and efficient way to do it.",1403474922

Many of these fail to replicate and are later discredited. The ones that do replicate are not always generalizable – sometimes an even slightly different situation will remove the effect or create exactly the opposite effect.<p>Generator-based tests (as in Haskell&#x27;s Quickcheck) could help here. Standard unit tests run assertions with hardcoded input values such as [0, 1, -1]. Generator based tests instead try to show that properties hold over randomly generated inputs, by replacing 1 with a generator of positive integers, -1 with a generator of negative integers, etc.<p>Imagine if social psychologists ran generator-based studies  as a hedge against unknown unknowns. The biggest challenge would be generating and executing valid permutations of the original experiment. Perhaps ad network AB-testing could be repurposed to run experiments as ads with randomly generated values.",1403474894

Software development is a craft - and as such, it plays a part in achieving outcomes. I don&#x27;t consider the ability to program a super power - anyone with a technical background is able to learn programming given time and the proper resources.<p>Start thinking more about what you are trying to achieve (the goal) and why you are approaching it in this particular way (the purpose). &quot;Meaningless work&quot; is often the result of decisions made on a whim - take the responsibility to investigate the goal and alternative methods to achieve the same result.<p>In order to find your work more meaningful, you should become more focused on the business aspects. Sometimes the best approach to solve a problem is meaningless work - but at least then that would be a comfort.<p>If you want to try something outside of your day job and you consider yourself good at web-related things, there&#x27;s little stopping you from setting up an e-commerce store and selling things. Shopify is an e-commerce solution on a platter, but there are many alternatives. I&#x27;ve recently setup a Wordpress + WooCommerce website + bought a theme (Kallyas) for my wife - <a href=""http://www.swartsbooks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swartsbooks.com</a> - still busy working out the kinks. Even though I could have built the store myself, I opted for the practical solution. My current side project focuses on addressing communication issues (e.g. complaints, notices, notifications, sharing of documents) in micro communities such as complexes, estates, shopping centres/malls and corporate parks.<p>You could also write e-books about your craft, similar to what Authority (<a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/authority/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/authority/</a>) suggests and sell them on gumroad.<p>If you like doing business, you might consider doing consultation + web development. I occasionally did this the past 2 years and made about $6K at $36/h for development and $30/h for consultation. The consultation part revolves around advising the best approach to take regarding the technical side and the impact on business concerning the technical side.

In the real world, no two institutions use the exact same implementation of HL7. Most systems in the US use one of the 2.x versions, which are pipe delimitted, prone to error, and not human-readable.<p>This understates how awful HL7 is. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s a non-standard &quot;standard&quot; (the only common thing about it between implementations is the name). Many implementations are <i>both</i> pipe-delimited <i>and</i> fixed-width, which makes generating a valid HL7 message for a single client absolute hell. Multiple clients? You might as well start from scratch each time. (And people wonder why innovation in health tech is so slow...).<p>I remember one brainstorming meeting I had with the CIO of a major, reputable hospital. I casually made some reference to setting up a webserver to receive HTTPS requests. I will never forget his expression. He sheepishly informed me that no, they can&#x27;t use HTTP (even with SSL). Instead, the process involves creating a dedicated tunnel, setting up a tcp connection within the tunnel, and then reading each &quot;chunk&quot; of data off the wire. Each datum comprises a variable number of packets[0], so you essentially have to buffer the stream manually so you can virtually &quot;push&quot; packets back on the stream if it turns out you weren&#x27;t supposed to read them.[1]<p>This is not a dig at the CIO; he clearly knew what he was doing. Unfortunately, he also knew the state of the systems he had to maintain internally, as well as the external ones he had to interoperate with, and the realities of what was feasible and what was not.<p>[0] If you&#x27;re having trouble picturing what I&#x27;m saying, imagine you&#x27;re in a foreign city and ask someone which bus stop you need to get off at.

You don't make up reasons not to hire someone, no matter how much you want to. You'd be doing a disservice both to the candidate and to yourself.<p>My single case is just that: a data point. Weigh it along with all your other data points before making your interview/no interview decision.",1227603045
376175,comment,375127,375127,0,0,cubix,,,"They're not putting things into the proper context: Sure, these chemicals probably are threats to human well-being, and figuring out how to remove them from our environment is worthwhile. However, the 20th century saw an unprecedented increase in life expectancy and quality of life, two great wars and god knows how many chemicals notwithstanding. I doubt many -- even those inflicted with the abnormalities mentioned in this documentary -- would choose to live in the world before synthetic materials were available, in 1908, say.<p>Also, it's totally one-sided and they lose a lot of credibility with the sensationalist tone of the piece -- ominous music, tableaux of helpless children next to deadly chemicals, mentions of human extinction... Please.",1227602841

376159,comment,374865,375039,0,0,demallien,,,"Well, <i>I</i> would counter that you just made my point for me!  The reason the app sucks is not that it doesn't connect to the bike - if you get someone to use it whilst actually on a bike they see the utility straight away (and indeed the base problem the app solves is how to get a decent exercise program going when your on-board computer is braindead, and hence can't be connected to).  The problem is that it is very difficult to market.  If I had asked the question 'Why does this suck?', people would have told me that it's because it doesn't connect to the bike, when in fact the real problem is elsewhere - asking the question would have got me the wrong answer, which was the point I was trying to make in my first point.",1227600373

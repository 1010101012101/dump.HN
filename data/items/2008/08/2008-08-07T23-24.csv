Apple = evil.<p>And metaphorically speaking, the devil can look good, it doesn't have to ugly and have horns.<p>Talking about evil, I bought a Mac Mini, and iPod touch, which was suposed to be free, with student discount,  and never recived it (the voucher).  I emailed customer support,  nothing yet.<p>The only thing I have is going back to one of their stores, and start complaining until somebody resolves the issue.<p>$300.00 they owe me back, is a lot of money.",1218153559
270142,comment,269850,270073,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Actually, I agree with you. Fit is important. I just want to encourage people to look for the cheap fit before heading for the more expensive one.<p>Really, the most important lesson is that you only need <i>one</i> good chef's knife. If you take good enough care of it (i.e. avoid needing to sharpen it so often that it becomes a matchstick) it will last a lifetime. So, really, go for it. Blow the $99 if you've shopped around and found the most comfortable knife in the world. It's not much money when amortized over your entire life.<p>(Incidentally, the first irony here is that my own chef's knife was a gift, from someone who probably does <i>not</i> read <i>Cook's Illustrated</i>, so it's probably a $70 knife.<p>The second irony is that, after a few years, I've concluded that my knife really doesn't fit me very well. So I'm probably going to end up buying another knife or two in an attempt to find something better. I'll be starting in the $26 range!<p>Which brings me to my last piece of advice: Don't give knives as gifts. Give gift certificates to stores that sell knives.)",1218153488

There isn't a lot of opensource hardware out there to go with all that software.<p>This board looses in all categories I would consider important when choosing an embedded linux board.  Those being speed, size, and price.  As you mentioned for a comparable price Beagle Board is much faster with cooler i/o features.  If you are going for price and size the lowest cost Gumstix (gumstix.com) is like a third the size, slightly more powerful and only costs 100 bucks.",1218153171

Its $149 and has a much more powerful ARM processor with a built-in DSP and 3d accelerator (probably similar to the chip powering the iPhone).  It already has an HDMI/DVI output and can also output S-Video.  Probably similar in size as well.  It has linux running on it already as well.",1218152079

- number of people who Emailed an individual asking about a specific topic
-percent of time spent in Outlook vs Visual Studio vs WoW (RescueTime-esque stuff)
- number of IMs initiated from someone at least one level higher than them<p>But at the end of the day, can that really tell you quantitatively that Bob is better than Suzie?  Even the example above about being stressed - I know people who are super chill and excel at their job, and others who are stressed all the time and also excel (and vice versa).<p>Maybe the answer is to pull in hundreds of these variables and run a neural net against actual performance rankings to see if any statistically significant correlations pop out?",1218151719

Your average small web company wouldn't mind having 100K paying users right now and they probably won't when 1M is less than 0.05% of net users.  Reasoning about percentages and limits is relevant if your target user base is of the same scale as the total market or you're counting on a VC pitch based on winner takes all.  It's not mandatory if all you care about is building a sustainable business: My local coffeehouse probably has a few hundred regular customers and their share of the worldwide coffee business is effectively 0%, but they're doing just fine financially.",1218151022

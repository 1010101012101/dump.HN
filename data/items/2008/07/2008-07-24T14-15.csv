By time the card expires you will have a decent credit limit, score, and interest rate and they will send you a new card. It would go faster if you used the card and payed it off right away but you can't use it if it is in the trash.",1216911446

That being said, I don't ever use them as 'credit' per se, to cover money I don't already have in the bank.  To me, they're merely a useful convenience.",1216911343

(Maybe that's why I spend time here).<p>OP, however, never mentions the most important thing about this demographic: <i>they just want it to work</i>.<p>They expect things to work intuitively right out of the box.  They don't want to install any add-ons, extensions, or downloads.  And they don't want to have to get an education just to try something new.<p>The gas pedal is always on the right and when you enter a room, flip the toggle switch up to get light.<p>So why doesn't your web app work like that?  If it doesn't work right with the browser and resolution they got when they bought their computer at Office Depot, if they have to wait for Flash, or they don't know what it is, they'll leave and never come back.<p>This is the 80% in the middle of the bell curve, and they <i>do</i> have money to spend.

From a $1.50 bottle of soda to a $100 tank of gas.  The bill of course gets paid in full every month.  Using the card means I don't have to carry a bunch of case, and I'm afforded some minor degree of security should my wallet get lost/stolen/misplaced as compared to cash.  I also get to ""keep"" my money an extra 30 days to earn a trivial amount of interest.<p>It's good for you to be thinking about these things, but getting a credit card is not a life-altering decision, it's just a normal thing like getting a cell phone or a pair of shows.  How you use the card, and put it to work for YOU, it what makes all the difference.",1216910795

I do have a checking account as well as a savings account, thus far, with a small local bank and ING direct.<p>I'm a strict believer of don't buy crap you can't afford, so I was wondering if you guys/gals had any advice as to whether or not it will be worth it for a person like me to get a credit card and which national/regional banks would be worth banking at for small business/personal uses.

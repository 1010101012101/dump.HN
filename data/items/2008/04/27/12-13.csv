I don't care if it contradicts my comment, that film rocks.)<p>There's a time for watching movies as much as for anything else. The problem with TV is that is puts you at one end of a big tube while they're feeding the other, with little choice as to what you get and lots of commercials.<p>I haven't watched TV for years now, but I do watch lots of anime and right now I'm at episode 3 of Blake's 7. The difference is I choose what I watch and try to make it as diverse and interesting as possible.<p>There's a lot to say about how I choose what I watch/read/listen. Sometimes I do just waste time on comedies, but sometimes it's a very active and rather difficult process of search and selection. I often go from an anime to a book of from reddit to a movie. Recently a sum of factors, mainly Junni Kokki (anime) but including a discussion here last week led me to some heavy Confucianist reading.\nThis is a topic which would be perfect for a web 2.0 startup, but I haven't seen any serious contenders and I don't have my ideeas settled yet. But just imagine: what if you could jump from somebody's profile here to his favorite media (books/movies/shows/music/articles)? What if you could make a ... gestalt of what hacker news or reddit or digg reads/watches/listens? \nIt took me 26 years to find out Ayn Rand existed (just an example). Before the net it could've taken me a lifetime or more. It's time to lower that a bit more, don't you think?",1209301196

174835,comment,174410,174600,0,0,m0nty,,,"""Because you're used to watching TV.""<p>I watch very little TV, so I can confirm your idea that you get used to doing more creative things if you cut it out. I <i>do</i> watch DVDs which I rent from Amazon, but that's different because I get to choose the shows and when I watch them. A lot of it is very non-mainstream so I get something more out of them as well. And no time wasted watching ads, what's not to like? :)<p>I also find most of the Internet very boring, until I start putting something back in. I've recently grown a bit tired of my main project for the last few months (surftrackr.net) so I'm starting another one as soon as I get a break from work, which has been tough recently.<p>I think the ""Here Comes Everybody"" guy has a real point about changing patterns here. I only hope there's a lot more to come and we haven't peaked already. Sometimes I feel not so optimistic.",1209300791

The point is not to get the number that will hold the test of time, but to get somewhere in a remote ball park so that you could know what the extreme bottom end is. For example one competitor may be worth 100 million and 1 is worth a billion. you could say well the bottom end looks like a 1.25% of a 100 million dollar company, or you may chose to average the two competitors and say the bottom end is y.<p>The point is not to get it exactly right, rather to get some number that you may or not be comfortable with. The second option would be to project potential customers as well as potential product price and work into your numbers that way.<p>I strongly urge you to try to project these numbers even on highly subjective data points.<p>As for you salary, do not put in your contract renegotiation, that puts you in a disadvantageous position at every round rather you should negotiate a schedule up front to return to market rates. e.g. if the company reached x capitalization you move to y% of current market rates.<p>With this model it puts you in the position to have a bargaining chip as funding rounds come around and not get diluted out while still being paid less than market.<p>With this structure if they continue to want to keep you below market (to keep the liability light) then they have to negotiate with you to further sell your earning potential.<p>Which is exactly what you are selling so you really need to know the price of what you are selling.

I see people put week-old store-brand coffee beans in a $500 Kitchen Aid grinder and serve a cup of absolutely vile tasting coffee. Some people simply don't deserve nice things.<p>However, a Burr grinder is good investment, especially if you need the finer grinds. The cheapest one you can find will do fine, however.<p>The blade-grinder will beat randomly around all your beans for the entire grind-time. This will kick the crap out of the aromatic oils, and you lose some flavour. The Burr grinder ""crunches"" each bean once and never touches it again, leaving the oils alone.",1258115936

I have tried variations of this with no success so far: parts-of-speech tagging in color doesn't seem to help, for example. Automatic extraction and highlighting of named entities is probably most promising.<p>More generally, it's about ways to help humans understand electronic text better by providing them hints and interactions that were not possible (or were difficult) with paper.<p>An established example of this is searching within a page. There are different implementation of this, some better than others: search-as-you-type is good, and so is highlighting all results.

939864,comment,939702,939702,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The most important thing I know about coffee: most of what you buy in stores is <i>stale</i>.  Even vacuum-sealed roasted whole beans are a compromise, expiration date notwithstanding.  Buy roasted whole beans at a place that roasts every week, and posts the roast date on the bin.  Never mind stuff being from Ethiopia, Costa Rica, Kona, &c.  It's most important to get the degree of roast you like, as recently as possible.<p>I go to the Allegro Roasters counter at Whole Foods each week and buy a medium roast from that day, or the day before.  I have a cheap grinder at home, and I just use cheap #2 cone filters in a cheap single-cup cone brewer.  I emphasize that those last 3 items are <i>cheap</i>.  You don't need a fancy-schmancy grinder.  You get a <i>huge</i> bang for the buck just by using beans roasted in the past 2 weeks.  The other thing: make sure your water is the right temperature.  (190 to 195 degrees seems to work for me.)  Just borrow a candy thermometer, always use the same amount of water, the same pot, and figure out how long to wait to let the water cool to the right temp.<p>I have wowed friends with my coffee.  Not rocket science.  It's just brewed at the right temp, and it's fresh!<p>Cheap cone brewer:  <a href=""http://amzn.com/B001S353EQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/B001S353EQ</a><p>Cone filters (hate the eco-guilt marketing, though):  <a href=""http://amzn.com/B000U5ACLW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/B000U5ACLW</a><p>My cheap grinder.

Everyone told them they were stupid and that they should get a ""real"" job and to stop dreaming, the idea didn't go as expected at first, they persevered without earning and eventually they managed to talk someone into believing in them, or they managed to make enough from their product to start hiring, and that's when you came along.<p>If you want to be the one that makes the money you've got to be the one that takes all the risks.

Fossil fuels consumption is not just cars, but Tomle seems to go there on and on.<p>Tomle: even if we account that all EVs are filled by electricity that comes from coal, their efficiency decreases dramatically the amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. It's just CO2 from production, not from constantly burning. Cities are also better off, without smog and several diseases. Less geoestrategic issues and probably less was, but you probably don't care.<p>And if you live somewhere like Spain, where in windy days daily electric production for the whole country increases from around 30% wind energy to a mix that reaches sometimes 50%, you are likely to pay way less for moving and be way more sustainable than with your tar sands clunker.<p>If you do want links with data for all the things I say here, I can look at them for you.

1859422,comment,1859353,1859395,0,0,rsingel,,,"As a journalist who agreed to Blekko's embargo, I'll give you my take. Very few companies can get journalists to agree to an embargo. Most startups don't have the luxury. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Zynga, Foursquare can do it. It's a question of importance and dilution. When you agree to an embargo, you don't know how many other sites you are competing against and you judge whether it's important enough to cover even if you don't get much interest in your version of the story.<p>Blekko, as a well-funded entrant with great tech cred trying to bust into a very interesting and nearly monopolized field, clearly counted.<p>If you are smaller and don't have that buzz, you don't have that luxury. Depending on your size and market, you don't need a PR firm (a good PR advisor is worthwhile). For many companies, it's better to figure out the place and writer you really want to cover you and offer an exclusive. You can then get follow-on press from other places by offering them untold angles -- especially ones that that writer or place would be interested in.<p>As a journalist, I hate embargoes, even as I understand why and how they are useful.<p>But the best advice I can give is not to think of blogs/publications as simply places to exploit. Writers can smell that from far off. Learn to cultivate relationships. Be a source. Critique our stories. Suggest trend stories and cool stuff other people are working on. Ask to talk off the record when you meet us at events and conferences. Learn to speak openly and honestly on the record.<p>In turn, you'll likely find writers you like. Writers will tell you things off the record (things we can't print) and are people who may write about you not just in this venture, but in your next. Writers are, like you, part of the tech ecosystem.",1288677361

Really, if the terrorists are too smart and too hardened to be scared by real consequences, can we shake them with groundless harassment?  If not, then what's the point of being a jerk to people who merely have ""suspicious"" cultural allegiances (e.g., having a book about Islam and having some funny souvenirs) and who break minor rules in ways that clearly don't pose a threat?<p>It isn't some clever attempt to smoke out terrorists.  They're policing our respect for <i>their</i> paranoia and profiling-based hot buttons.  Showing a flagrant interest in Islam (even one that doesn't show any seriousness, as in this case) is, to them, the same as singing ""Ba ba ba, ba Barbara Ann"" in the security line -- it's a really rude abuse of their poor nerves! -- except that for some weird reason it isn't against the law.  The main thing is for travelers to go out of their way to avoid making them nervous, and to be apologetic if you actually do make them nervous.  Then they know your heart is in the right place.  This guy <i>could</i> have put his ""Muslim paraphernalia"" in his checked baggage, or just left it at home.  The fact that he didn't showed disrespect for their prejudices and their blood pressure.  That's why they yelled at him; to restore his respect for their authority.<p>The bottom line is that the bullet is the only thing he was carrying that was actually an infringement of the rules, but they mostly yelled at him for his interest in Islam and a few Islamic countries.

For example, at the moment they're tied at the hip to Orbitz and get very, very little of the value created by a ticket purchase.  I bought a roundtrip to DC with them for ~$300, and they probably saw $3 or so from that.  <i>However.</i>  If they prove in micro-scale that people buy more tickets through their interface than the interface of competing providers, then the carriers have a huge, huge incentive to deal with them directly and cut Orbitz out of the loop.  And then its like ""Hey, we're 1% more efficient than the current leader of a multi-billion dollar market which has no switching costs.""  I wouldn't regret being in that situation, because there is a range of predictable next actions and almost all of them result in good stuff for the founders.<p>And if they can't sell tickets with all the gnarly fulfillment and credit card processing done by Orbitz, great.  Learn the interface paradigm doesn't add value <i>now</i> before you spend several million on building out the company to support it.

Thats why I don't care one bit about karma.<p>You have chosen to compare what I was talking about, GDP (Nominal in this case) and a percentage of dollars (since you quote the USDA, I was talking about worldwide btw, just like the op) to food. It's an apples to oranges comparison, and for the most part, reinforces my comment above, that someone down-voted.<p>Yes, we spend less on food than we did in 1929. Do you have cows in your back yard btilly? Probably not. Why do I ask? Because comparing the farming industry in 1929 to the industry of 2010 is like comparing the age of slaughtering your own ""home-raised"" cow, to the age of mechanized cow raising, slaughtering, and delivery into the closest super market. Um, of course the price is lower. The real interesting part, though, is that the price could be even lower if the money supply wasn't artificially increased by trillions of dollars. Fun fact, if $1.00 would have purchased $1.00 worth of goods in 1929 (which it did), if you had instead, saved it until 2010, it would purchase ... wait for it ... $0.08 worth of goods. Does that not strike you as odd, that although productivity has boomed, e.g., we can make more things for less dollars, the value of the dollar has plummeted?<p>But to the main point, it shows by your argument that you failed to grasp the full extent of what I was saying. Money is just paper. How do I know that? When a country can lend itself (by selling its paper for another countries paper, in the case of the US, China purchases the vast majority of US treasuries, though, no one even knows if China is printing money, or being disciplined with their monetary policy) trillions of dollars and put that into circulation, of course the GDP will rise, but has progress been made? NO. GDP is nominal, not absolute, and it does not reflect productivity, or even actual PHYSICAL output! It reflects prices.<p>In a small country of 10 people, if all of those people have $1, and a barrel of oil is $1, the GDP is $10 or 10 barrels of oil. If the government prints up $10 more dollars and hands it out to those 10 people, now everyone has $20, but oil prices increase to $20 since MV = PQ. Ah, now the GDP is $20, but we can still only buy 10 barrels of oil. Now that is Your kind of progress.<p>My point, to wrap it up, was that things like global literacy and hunger are things we have been improving. Improving global GDP has no measurable impact by just inflating the number. The number is just a number unless it is put in real terms, which is not how the original post read when it listed ""improving global GDP"" as some kind of accomplishment.",1288675364

Again a deficiency in the definition of harm (total harm, harm per capita, economic harm, social harm, initial harm, expected lifetime harm, average harm, what does harm even mean) leading to conclusions not supported by evidence.<p>A more specific chart and methodology would help people to do informed reasoning. If your presentation of evidence isn't actually helping people to make more informed conclusions, <i>what is it doing</i>?",1288675025

They make fancy predictions which help locate terrorists, allocate finances, and other cool things, but the only thing that will make politics efficient are effective politicians.  Data mining won't mash out all the filibusters that happen at the house.<p>I would say if you want to learn about data mining and machine learning techniques, palantir is the right choice.<p>If you want to do a startup later, facebook is the right choice.  Facebook tends to buy out many small startups, so there will be many at that company who have the same mindset as you do.  This is important should you decide to look for cofounders who have the same startup passions.  I can't really think of any startups acquired by palantir.<p>I'll also mention that it's easier to placate investors if you tell them your startup team consists of ex-facebook or ex-google employees.  A startup with ex-palantir employees just doesn't have the same homerun ring to it, and when investors are making that gut judgement call after looking at 2 slides from your 5 minute pitch, they're going to go with the team with ex-facebook employees.",1288674977

It's not that by dying earlier we keep the gene pool fitter, because that's not how evolution works. (We'd otherwise have a much more complicated algorithm on our hands.) Rather, we die simply because there is no advantage in having us persist--we only gained and conserved what was optimal for our species' lifecycle. Anything else requires extra energy and support machinery and is not likely to be amplified since occasional breakdowns are likely to be serious or fatal (and more common with the increased complexity!)<p>Compare gymnosperms (conifers) and certain angiosperms (flowering plants). The former persist for long periods under drought and stress conditions and only bear seeds after a two-year long development. Some desert angiosperms sprout, pollinate, spread seeds, then die in the span of a week. -- Different evolutionary strategies evolved under different environments and selection pressures.<p>(Concession: evolution isn't ""optimal"", but it has found good enough solutions that I often call it such.)",1288674427

They know that being in on the pre-IPO = instant wealth. It is hard to pass up that opportunity. I am sure they are not leaving due to the fact that Facebook offer more exciting and challenging work but when faced with a few years of work, IPO and then do what you want to it is hard to stick around even at Google. The part that I look forward to is the start-up boom that is coming after FB IPO's. I expect to see these developers leave in droves to start their own ventures with their new found wealth from the IPO. That is when tech will get pretty interesting again.

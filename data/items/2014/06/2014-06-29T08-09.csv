The issue arises when you have a large team with varying skill levels, all working on the same front-end, with things stuck in the $scope when they shouldn&#x27;t be, over-use and abuse of $watch, and a stack of other gotchas that make debugging an absolute nightmare, as tracing the execution flow is nigh on impossible.<p>That&#x27;s where Flux is trying to do things differently. By having one way of passing data between the various components (and plugged directly into React, which also is built around a &quot;componentized&quot; architecture) you know exactly where to look when things go wrong, you give up a bit of dynamism and magic for explicitness, which in my experience is not a bad thing.

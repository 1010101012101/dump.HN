It wasn&#x27;t unusual for a marketer to ask for 6 or more tracking/analytics scripts (that all claim to do the same thing).  The scripts were usually archaic and baroque, and unable to handle common web patterns like Post-Redirect-Get or AJAX without worakarounds.<p>They usually had lots of parameters so that you could specify exactly what data you wanted when an event happened...  But for marketers who didn&#x27;t really know what they were looking for, and therefore couldn&#x27;t specify, the results were of course insufficient.  So the natural solution was to add yet another 3rd-party script that promises to do magic.<p>Of course, when you&#x27;re talking about a database-backed web application whose very nature is to store data and do queries for reports, most of these scripts are obviously more than a little redundant.  If the specs for the site included what needed to be tracked and what reports were needed, then the 3rd party scripts wouldn&#x27;t be needed at all (except for the ones that track you across multiple sites or inject supercookies).  But it&#x27;s quicker and easier just to try adding more 3rd party snake oil.",1448344517

I am not sure why you think a finer brush would destroy the impressionistic qualities of artwork. That seems like saying we&#x27;ve lost our appreciation for good lighting, because we use LED light bulbs instead of wax candles. Artists can easily canvas on 4k, 8k, or larger resolutions with modern tools, and achieve vistas that will outshine most previous artwork in fidelity.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to compare contemporary digital art to pre-modern paintings, because there would be no point. But we can compare the quality of the canvas medium, the fidelity of the work. I am certain anyone who has spent any amount of time creating a digital college, set of high quality wallpapers, etc, has noticed that pre-digital artwork is often vastly lacking in terms of resolution. This contrast is difficult to notice in a museum, where artwork is displayed alongside its peers; it is obvious when comparing it to digital styles of art.<p>There is nothing wrong with wishing for more detail. You can have impressionistic artwork in 16k resolution, and enjoy it too.",1448341687

Kites/frisbees/skateboards etc. typically don&#x27;t carry cameras, however, whereas it&#x27;s quite easy to equip a small drone with one.  Isn&#x27;t it conceivable that a small drone equipped with a camera could monitor a facility (prison/bank etc.) from above and uncover and exploit security flaws that exist in that facility?\nI&#x27;m interested in hearing your take on the issue of drone regulation though as I see from your profile you are far more qualified to discuss it than I am.

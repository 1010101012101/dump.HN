9017526,comment,9017030,9017030,0,0,patcheudor,,,"I recently collected a bug bounty from Samsung on a crypto implementation flaw I found in some of their software.  The fix is still being rolled out and given the impact I&#x27;m not going to disclose right now, rather I&#x27;ll let Samsung handle that when the time is right.  Anyway, the team at Samsung was responsive and they seemed like they genuinely cared about security.  However, based on what I&#x27;ve seen in their products and those from their competitors the first thing I would do is pen-test the voice recognition feature, then turn it off no matter the outcome.  The fact is, if it must communicate with a back-end server to work, then it becomes incredibly hard to lock the solution down.  Even if the TV is properly validating the public cert of the server when doing the TLS handshake, there&#x27;s got to be a mechanism on the TV for updating the trusted root store because at the end of the day, certs need to expire and thus must be updated.  On a few non Samsung smart TV&#x27;s I&#x27;ve looked at over the years, updating the trusted root store on the TV is as &quot;easy&quot; as man in the middling (MitM) the network the TV is on so that web traffic goes to a site I own which has a link to the my.cer root CA that I generated and am using in my TLS MitM solution.  From there I just bring up the web browser on the TV, click on the my.cer link and go through the prompts to install the root CA.  After that point all traffic from the TV can be decrypted on the wire.<p>Now it is fair to say that the attack I just described requires the ability to MitM the network and have physical access to the device, however, remember that these TV&#x27;s use an IR remote & all an attacker needs is visual access to the TV.  If it can be seen through a window it can be controlled through a window and these things typically don&#x27;t require a password to modify the WiFi settings.  Some smart TVs also have proxy settings which again, typically don&#x27;t require a password to modify.<p>Given what I just covered, think hotel.  From a risk perspective that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d be most worried about.  I wonder how many are installing smart TVs with voice recognition?  For all other scenarios basically the situation in many cases on the ground is that you are secure because no one is targeting you.  In the case of a hotel, someone could be targeting everyone.  Such an attack could prove valuable, especially if done in executive suites near financial centers.",1423410735

Scala has a compiler plugin for type-directed CPS, but you have to annotate the crap out of your functions and things break down in a bad way for generic higher-order functions.

This is true, but sacrificing operational denotations only hurts if you replace it with nothing else—<i>and abstractions of general purpose languages are almost always more interpretable than the operational denotation of the base language itself!</i><p>Of course, there are always places for poor abstractions. I am not talking about these. Abstractions which are intentionally opaque, have confusing action-at-a-distance, etc---you&#x27;re bringing down the name of abstraction in general. &quot;Leaky&quot; is insufficiently demeaning.<p>A good abstraction will have its own semantics. These can be equational, denotational, operational, what-have-you but, essentially, these semantics must be easier/simpler/more relevant than the semantics of the base language they&#x27;re embedded in. Otherwise why abstract?<p>So what does React give you? It gives you, more or less, a value-based compositional semantics. Components have some &quot;living&quot; nature (an operational semantics w.r.t. to state) but they&#x27;re mostly defined by their static nature. Because you can build whole applications thinking only about the static, compositional nature of components you can take massive advantage of this abstraction.<p>Ultimately, <i>you do not want</i> operational semantics for React. This is what gives us React Native, background rendering, and probably what will lead to sensible animations (in time). To define operational semantics, especially ones which have to look like or (worse) be identical to those of Javascript, would destroy almost all possibility of extension. At the cost of making things more complex and harder to reason about.<p>All so that you can just stick to &quot;obvious&quot; Javascript base operations.",1423409886

I may ask them to still start solving a really simple problem -- it may or may not make it all the way to code. If someone starts writing/mapping out their database first that tells me something, I can ask why they are breaking their objects where they are, etc.<p>I like to ask &quot;what&#x27;s important&quot; in the context of components - I use the example of a bunch of HTML documents to frame the context. If I&#x27;m looking at 10 similar HTML documents, what can I do to find important information? (Strip out things that are the same). So if I&#x27;m doing 10 interviews, what do you think is going to be the same (user/session management if there are accounts would be an example) and what do you think will allow you to differentiate yourself?

9017475,comment,9017027,9017407,0,0,fyarebox,,,"I&#x27;ll expand on this with my understanding.<p>Library - a collection of useful things.
Framework - a collection of things, and a methodology, used to structure your application.<p>In general, a lot of new, modern frameworks do &#x27;call you&#x27; (Inversion of Control). Exmaple: Most PHP frameworks are setup so that you put all your models in one folder, your routes in another, etc. Then the framework itself accepts requests and determines which parts of your code to pass it through, and in what order.<p>However, you can also have frameworks that don&#x27;t do IoC. You setup the framework, tell it what to do, tell it how to do it. But you still structure your code around that specific framework&#x27;s methodology (which is why it&#x27;s hard to mix &#x27;n&#x27; match).<p>jQuery is an odd thing, because it&#x27;s not really either of these. It provides lots of useful functions, but it also does so in a way that it replaces a lot of the &#x27;core language features&#x27;, and causes you to use it across most of your code.<p>However, I&#x27;d still say it&#x27;s a library (with a very nice syntax) - since it doesn&#x27;t tell you &#x27;this is how you structure your application&#x27;. You can use jQuery how ever you like, and it imposes almost no constraints. Therefore it&#x27;s not a framework.",1423409504

It&#x27;s not just Germany that&#x27;s a big fish in the Euro-centre pursuing its interests over the smaller fish.<p>><i>Russia sanctions are primarily driven by the US. Germany does brisk business with Russia and tried for a while to avoid sanctions.</i><p>In the EU, we see Germany pushing for them constantly.<p>><i>More imporantly Russia, via the Russian armed Ukrainian rebels is invading Ukraine, leading, among other things, to shooting down Malaysian airplanes. You are saying we should ignore this, and let Russia simply have its way?</i><p>I&#x27;m saying, the legitimate government of Ukraine was toppled to be replaced with some pro-West-interests friendly lackeys (and neo-nazis at that), and Russia did what it had to protect an area by its borders with 60% citizens of Russian descent -- which was in no way an &quot;invasion&quot;. As for the &quot;shooting down of Malaysian airplanes&quot; that Russia had anything to do with the matter was a fairy-tale even worse than the BS pretexts of Bush and Blair during the Iraq war.<p>As a thought experiment, what would the US do if a part of Mexico was inhabited by 60% citizens of US ethnicity, and the legitimate government of Mecico was toppled and replaced with a, say, pro-Chinese government, with known racial hatred for that American ethnic minority among them?<p>Countries like Germany or the US, that ACTUALLY invaded places 10.000 miles away that had nothing to do with them and occupied them, mostly for oil and control of the area, are in a very bad place to talk about Russia and Crimea.<p>><i>Re 1) Substantially more Germans died in the last century in wars than Greeks</i><p>So? It wasn&#x27;t Greeks that killed them. Plus, those Germans went looking for it, and exterminating millions of people in the process. More Germans died than Jews too, but I wouldn&#x27;t make a big deal out of it.<p>><i>Re 2) The allies bombed German cities. As far as I&#x27;m aware Greece was part of the Allies.</i><p>Not the part that bombed German cities, as it hardly had an air force. Greece, utterly destroyed after the German Occupation, didn&#x27;t even send any real army to Germany along with the rest of the allies.<p>><i>Re 3) You mean like the &quot;scortched earth policy&quot; of the Greek army when they were forced out of Turkey?</i><p>Yeah, I mean like that, but from an invading army that didn&#x27;t have any place being in Greece at all (whereas Greece had around 1.5 million Greek population living under Turkish occupation in Asia Minor that it tried to liberate. An area, furthermore, inhabited by Greeks since ancient times, that was, like mainland Greece and most of the Balkans, under occupation by the  expanding Ottoman Empire for a few centuries).<p>But even if it wasn&#x27;t so, your example would just mean that the Greeks also owe to Turks, not that Germans don&#x27;t owe to the Greeks for what they&#x27;ve done.<p>><i>As to infrastructure, Germany&#x27;s was way more destroyed.</i><p>Yeah, when you declare nazi expansion war on the World, these things happen. Cry me a river.<p>><i>They rebuilt it in a decade or so.</i><p>Mostly thanks to being the new darlings of the West, in a cold war ploy against USSR/East Germany Europe. Not exactly &quot;left to their own devices&quot; and with hard work, as the myth says.<p>><i>Infrastructure needs continually to be modernised anyway, as infrastructure is subject to wear and tear.</i><p>A, so the occupying nazi forces actually did Greece a favor, destroying it&#x27;s infrastructure so it could modernize it!<p>><i>Re 4 and 5) The war reparation have been covered by various treaties over the decades (which were designed by the allies), and long been settled.</i><p>Actually not settled at all, and with Greek goverments of the time (cold war puppets) forced to consign to BS deals unlike most of the other countries.<p>><i>Speaking of war reparations, when will pay Greece reparations for example to Turkey for the Greco-Turkish war that Greece started in 1919?</i><p>Greece went under financial supervision as a result of exactly that. But you seem to forget that Turkey started an ethnic cleansing campaign years before that, and that the Ottoman Empire had kept Greeks (and lots of others besides) under occupation for several centuries.<p>><i>A more interesting question is: why do so many Greeks leave the motherland and go to the US, the UK, Germany, Australia?</i><p>Because Greece, not a rich country to begin with, was left destitute by the nazis at the end of the war, never got the recuperations it should, and then, in the Cold war the followed, due to its lots of communist sympathizers, it was kept under close guard, including foreign powers organizing a full blown civil war, and helping establish friendly lackeys in place down to a full blow dictatorship in 1967. That&#x27;s what happens to official or unofficial colonies and neo-colonies when the big players have their way.<p>><i>Re 7) I&#x27;m not sure what you are referring to here. Greece and Germany hardly compete with each other. The weakening of the Euro benefits German and Greek exporters. But not that Germany has been trying to avoid this weakening.</i><p>Germany with its already high exports had tried to deny any policy to weaken the Euro for ages, hurting EU countries with less fortunate import/export ratios.<p>><i>I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you mean here.</i><p>I mean that German companies, like Siemens, bribed Greek politicians / lackeys for decades to win huge public tenders, and when found the German government protected them, and even gave asylum to Greek representatives of the companies.",1423408655

9017419,comment,9017027,9017385,0,0,jasonwocky,,,"> When interviewing for a specific role, you have to think very hard about what it is you are trying to do - and don&#x27;t just fall back on generic cut and paste questions.<p>I think this is true, but it raises a question about &quot;hiring for a specific role.&quot;<p>I find that when companies do this, they&#x27;re in a reactive mode. Which of course is going to happen from time to time, but the reason memes like the OP get born is because many companies are habitually reactive when it comes to hiring.<p>I don&#x27;t follow a lot of sports, but I follow NFL football. Each year, the teams get to &quot;draft&quot; (a/k/a hire) incoming players from college. When it comes to the NFL draft, there are two prevailing philosophies: &quot;Draft for Need&quot; and &quot;Draft Best Player Available&quot;. Without question, teams that stick to more of a BPA approach tend to have longer term success. Teams that draft for need <i>sometimes</i> get that player that helps them get over the hump and win a championship, but more often they&#x27;re trading away long-term greatness for some short-term pain relief.<p>I think hiring for software teams (and just about anything where there is a lot of variance in depth and breadth of skill) follows the same pattern. Hiring for a specific role is an antipattern (albeit sometimes a necessary one). If you have a very specific role to fill, perhaps a freelancer or a consultant might be a better fit for easing the short-term pain. Then you let them go as soon as they&#x27;re no longer needed.",1423408460

The company is .net all the way and has a couple of permanent developers who know only VB and have no C# experience. Because of a large influx of work, these developers needed some additional resource for a short period of time. I wanted to try and increase the skill level of the permanent developers as they are not very familiar with design patterns and &#x27;modern&#x27; techniques. To this end, I wanted C# developers with familiarity with design patterns and modern best practice to come in and develop in VB. I didn&#x27;t care if they hadn&#x27;t used VB recently at all.

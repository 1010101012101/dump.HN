Because not everyone's body is made the same, this can cause problems down the line since the movements are not natural. You are also recruiting less of the smaller muscles in your body that help with stability and balance, while only developing the larger/dominant muscles.

The religion was founded to gather his followers.<p>So, yes, you can say Christianity is based on that.<p>> Specifically, I've met and had in depth discussions with many Christians (including priests and lay people) from different schools. None of them could tell me what the teaching of Jesus is. Some were able to tell me words that they had learned, like ""love"" or ""truth"" or ""law"", but upon my questions made through those terms (e.g. What is love?), no one among them could answer with substance.<p>Jesus preachings weren't in a philosophical level, so you'll never get an answer from a Christian about the nature of love (""What is love?""). For this you want Plato.<p>In his parables [1], though, he left messages about the importance of loving and forgiving, among others. These teachings just aren't synthesized.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parables_of_Jesus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parables_of_Jesus</a><p>> (...) but it's because he told people the truth about religions that he was killed by the religious people in those times.<p>He neither preached in favor <i>or</i> against religions, so it's untrue to say he was killed for that. Jesus was crucified for political reasons, for Rome couldn't let a gentile gather a following. That was standard practice during the Roman Empire, to publicly kill local/tribal leaders.<p>>  That's how I know that education/propagation of Abrahamic texts is quite antithetical to the life activities of Jesus himself, and their inclusion in a religion precludes the coexistence of the true teaching of a saint such as Jesus.<p>The fact Abrahamism is incorporated is an historical accident - these were the gospels of the people who funded Christianity.  For instance, the talion law from Exodus (""eye for an eye..."") is later discussed by Jesus in a different perspective (""whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also"").<p>So, yes, it can be conflicting for religions that postulate following whatever is written - or worse, the parts they want you to follow, since the gospels have been manipulated endlessly. But the fact they were part of the <i>foundation</i> of Christianity isn't necessarily bad, because it's part of their history.",1365101473

I watched a performance a week or two ago, and a guy in front of me took photos and videos for 20 minutes straight then abruptly got distracted and walked away. It struck me as precisely the symptom of working to externalize your life so much that you forget to actually experience it.<p>Thinking in terms of narcissism, distraction, oversharing, externalization, etc, I've realized how scary and absurd the Google Glass marketing is. It's been marketed as something that will let us come back to reality and genuine interpersonal relationships, when it's only going to indulge our tendency towards sharing and distraction even more. I think that in order to market Google Glass effectively they had to make the absurd claim that even easier access to the internet will cure our anxious attachment to it.",1365101414
5494513,comment,5492954,5492954,1,0,qzxt,,,"I couldn't help but detect a certain level of bourgeois elitism in the article, which in some part is why the rift is large as they claim, but in a larger sense, is why the rift is as large as they claim.<p>That may seem a bit confusing to read, but when you look at the typical tech-rich set, there is no inherent need to fit in with the crowd, simply for the sake of fitting-in. ""The art scene"" for the most part is exactly just that. Speaking as someone quite interested in art history, I can attest to the fact that the ""high art"" world is very much a relic from old times - when children were raised to watch their status and life was a giant popularity contest. Now that's not to say that the tech-set are impervious to elitist behavior, but tech elitism is based more heavily on talent, intelligence, and creativity. So in a way, it's a kind of elitism that is forced on the culture itself, in a pursuit for the most ""innovative"" way to do something. Where the art crowd admires ""witty"" quasi-intellectual banter, the tech-set are more likely to be interested in something, more demonstrably cool or unique to their interests. This obviously poses a dilemma for art dealers from that standpoint - how do you interest someone in something they have no interest in. It is a dilemma that art dealers face, not just with ""nerds"" but with anyone, really. But convincing the average Joe to be interested in your activity because ""it's what the cool kids do"" is a lot easier than convincing someone who may not necessarily care much for sitting at the cool kids' table.<p>So in a sense, the tech crowd doesn't buy into high art because it's a group that generally doesn't have any particular need to fit-in for fitting in sake, but in a larger sense, the elitism in the high art world is reliant more on popularity and everyone reading the same books and speaking the same language, which is complete anathema to a group whose principles are based more on ""cool shit"" than club membership.<p>But then again, these are just my generalizations :)",1365101406

That tier would need to track dyno availability and then you're right back to the same distributed state problem.<p>Perhaps you mean if the second tier was smaller, or even a single node? In that case, yes, we did try a variation of that. It had some benefits but also some downsides, one being that the extra network hop added latency overhead.

Most C code returns errors and doesn't use exceptions (though I have used setjmp()/longjmp() fairly successfully at times).<p>In practice, the code is more verbose with Go's style of returned errors, but requires you to think more explicitly about errors and recovery, resulting in potentially better code overall.<p>However, since Go doesn't have an RIAA like C++ and doesn't have ""goto"" like C, it makes cleaning up from errors more ugly and repetitious (and potentially error prone).

I remember trying out a very very alpha SublimeText that didn't have undo -- funny how things go.<p>* Optimizing the colorscheme and button and canvas layouts of IDEs. I went for blank - hide everything and leave only the canvas visible - in Intellij, Visual Studio, and Eclipse.<p>Eventually, I read Yehuda's article 2 years ago. I took the same approach, and it's been amazing. I have never felt my brain connected to my editor this well.<p>I still ""use Vim my own way"". I save with CTRL-S, copy-paste with CTRL-C/V for example. I'm fully aware of the proper way to do it, and I do that when I'm ssh'd in a server. It is embarrassing but it works. I'm slowly shaving away these embarrassing usage scenarios and becoming a 'pure' Vim user.<p>Today, I write entire products and libraries at amazing speed (this includes creating files and directory layouts with NERDTree, jumping to files with CTRL-P, etc - no mouse whatsoever, which is very hard to do in a traditional IDE).<p>I would go further and say that in certain situations (dynamic languages) Vim <i>does</i> become the Holy Grail for me; and I owe that to Yehuda.<p>Thanks, wycatz!",1365100722

That increased strength improves life expectancy should be the null hypothesis. At least at the one end, extreme frailty is a common eye test for poor health. Since this isn't a scientific journal here, but a discussion, I think most of us would agree that stronger people often have more resources to ward off disease, cope with temporary reductions in nutrient bioavailability longer, can defend themselves from threats more easily, and can avoid more dangerous falls by maintaining their center of balance. And that's not a comprehensive list.<p>Personally, I'm satisfied that increased strength reduces all cause mortality and I believe the link is strong enough to be actionable now. I'm an evangelist for it among my older friends and relatives. One way strength reduces deaths is by preventing common injuries, e.g., falling and breaking a hip. A recent study showed that a simple graded test of sitting on the ground to standing could differentiate mortality risk sharply.

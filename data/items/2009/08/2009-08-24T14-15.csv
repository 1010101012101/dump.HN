782254,comment,781381,781914,0,0,Retric,,,"I don't think thought is all that uniform across humanity.  I don't walk around with a little voice yammering about all of life’s petty annoyances.<p>Back in school I was diagnosed as exceptionally gifted / learning disabled.  So I am probably an extreme outlier, but I don't think of myself as the voice in my head.  The voice is stuck with language which is this huge, unwieldy instrument, that's far too slow to be interesting.  If feels like there are separate machines that can preplan how to move my body, solve math problems, play a video game, etc.  Still composing this sentence feels more like remembering the words that best fit the idea, while scrabbling to find the next word to fill out the logical sequence.<p>Anyway, the best analogy for who I am might be the entity that decides which ideas are terrible and which ones are reasonable enough to keep.  But, I don’t hear other people talking about themselves like this, so I wonder if there is all that much commonality.  When there are so many ways solve a programming problem why assume that everyone is wired up the same way.  Considering all the crazy people out there and how people can function with significant brain damage, there is probably a wide range of internal landscapes even among normal seeming people.<p>PS: Consider how many different ways people you know react to alcohol a simple drug and then consider love as a huge cascade of chemical responses.

It made me wonder whether it's possible to make something similar for desktop apps.<p>It's good that this is built in Python. I used to use C to write desktop apps, but developing in C is very, very slow. Using Python not only allows quick development, but it also allows you make ""binary"" packages that run on all Linux variants irregardless of ABI differences.<p>However, Quickly is doing something wrong compared to Rails: marketing and polish. The Quickly website is just a Launchpad page, and their documentation is just a wiki. They should have a proper website with documentation in an easy-to-read format that doesn't feel messy, maybe a few screencasts too.

We don't know if they are signed and 32 or 64bit values.<p>The histogram is indeed the best algorithm and the one I would use. I call it the hash select. Note that it may be applied recursively, by narrowing the bins. Quick select is then in fact the hash select with only two bins.<p>Note also that since histogram filling is distributed, one needs to add up the histograms to find the one containing the median value. This is a good reason for not using histograms with 2^32 or 2^64 bins.<p>A 1024 bin histogram, would allow to find the median value of 32 bit integers in at most 4 iterations, and 64bit integers in at most 7 iterations.<p>The algorithm to identify the bin containing the median value is then very similar. One adds up the number of all lower values, until the bin containing the n/2 th value is found. This bin contains the median value.<p>Instead of adding up all histogram, which may be done pairwise (OlogN), one could do this for each bin, progressively, until the bin containing the median value is found. I guess there is a nice optimal and distributed algorithm to find out there. But we get the general picture.<p>Another optimization would be to adjust the histogram boundaries to fit the biggest and lowest value in the value set.",1251124057

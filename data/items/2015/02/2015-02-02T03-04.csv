I have 15+ years of experience in IT industry. Actually I am a system architect in a medium sized software company (900+ employees). Meanwhile, I believe that theoretical knowledge is useless without practice, so I always have enough time for programming.<p>I have a deep knowledge in the web applications development including building of different APIs as well as integration of various products. Nowadays I am passionate about modern cloud technologies like AWS services, Docker, OpenStack, Puppet, Chef, Heroku, ZeroMQ, Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.<p>Technologies: JS, PHP, Python, SQL and NoSQL, bash, Node.js, Symfony, Django, jQuery, ExtJS (Sencha), Dojo, Backbone.js, XML/XSLT/XPATH, SOAP, RESTful, oAuth, OOP, architectural design patterns, etc. /this list is very long and it grows every day/
I always learn something new. Nowadays I am taking some courses about machine learning from Stanford university.<p>CV: <a href=""http://nta.guru/cv/resume.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nta.guru/cv/resume.pdf</a><p>I am able to build development teams from scratch. Moreover, I managed to do it several times. One of these teams was distributed and successfully worked remotely for about 5 years.
Also I have an own project where I am going to make a device for automatic meters reading.  My responsibilities here: requirements, finances, sales, architecture and web service development. The prototype of web-service is implemented using the Amazon Web Services technologies like AWS EC2 and Amazon RDS.<p>For each project my number #1 goal is to find a balance between requirements and the reasonable cost. I always try do not reinvent the wheel and reuse the existing solutions. Meanwhile I am quite creative and able to make something absolutely new.<p>Currently I am looking for a new challenge to make something valuable. I want to find a project where I can utilize my talents to the maximum.",1422849496

Everyone sees the execution on that exchange, but they don&#x27;t know whether or not some additional portion is being routed to another exchange.<p>One situation that people often _mistake_ for this type of prior knowledge is the following: You are a market-maker, and at the current price, you want to buy X shares (you&#x27;re also willing to sell at some slightly higher price, and willing to buy more at some lower price, but at the current bid, your appetite is X). Since the US equity market is very fragmented, the best way to make that happen is to place an order for X shares on all of the dozens of different venues, and hope one of them gets executed. When your order on one venue gets executed, you want to cancel your orders on all of the other venues quickly so that you don&#x27;t get overfilled and accidently buy more than X. If you&#x27;re a person who&#x27;s trying to sell 2 * X or 3 * X shares, and the price moves down after you sell the first X, it may look like someone knew about the rest of your order and sold ahead of you, but it&#x27;s actually just the market-maker trying to control their inventory.",1422848115

What the hell is a proposal? What do I write in it. Is there a sample template I use for SaaS?<p>Even more worrisome, what if I&#x27;m end up having to do so much more work than what was anticipated?<p>However a competitor&#x27;s software apparently does the job but they are worried about the total cost where as my pricing is a lot simpler (unmetered usage for high $$$ / month X 12 months). I estimate about 100 hours of work on product but I am willing to do it because my competitor&#x27;s product does it smoothly and I need to be up there in terms of quality.<p>I just never saw this coming?! Like the other day I was thinking, who in the world would end up paying this for an entire year up front.<p>It&#x27;s a SaaS I bootstrapped, worked on the product by myself, so I don&#x27;t want to blow this off, and they seem to want this because of the pricing being low....<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a way to get my foot in the door and raise prices or be able to change it in case I end up losing money?<p>All this is very new to me, please help!",1422846075

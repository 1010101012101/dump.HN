It&#x27;s a nice way to get yourself fully immersed in a different world. But by focusing too much on what those people <i>actually</i> thought, it risks leaving out all the unacknowledged and unrecorded assumptions that lubricated their society. Some of those things only become apparent when you are far enough from the scene.<p>There is &quot;information&quot; as it objectively exists and functions in the universe. Then there is &quot;information&quot; as it is subjectively acknowledged and exploited by any given person or society at any given time. The two are related but not identical. Both are interesting and important to study. It&#x27;s okay if you want to focus on one more than the other, but there is no need to disparage the other.",1439945900

10083083,comment,10080680,10080680,0,0,Gatsky,,,"I think the key finding is this:<p>&quot;Results for all cause mortality were similar. Prior to 2000, 24 trials reported all cause-mortality and 5 reported significant reductions in total mortality (25%), 18 were null (71%) and one (CAST) reported significant harm (Table 3). Following the year 2000, no study showed a significant benefit for total mortality.&quot;<p>So 24/30 pre-2000 trials they looked at reported all cause mortality. This is important because all cause mortality is the gold standard endpoint in a clinical trial. If you were cherry picking an outcome measure, this is the last one you would choose as it&#x27;s the hardest one to get a positive result for.<p>This casts doubt on the paper&#x27;s central thesis. How to explain the difference in pre and post registration all cause mortality? The possibilities are:
1. Trials performed after 2000 are genuinely less likely to be positive because of altered funding, lack of low hanging fruit etc. It is a well known problem that estimating the survival of the control group in a randomised trial based on historical data is usually an underestimate, which messes up the power calculation and the chance of a positive result. Beyond a certain point, it becomes infeasible to do a clinical trial to show a benefit over a very healthy control group, because you would need 100,000 patients.
2. After registration became mandatory, fraudulent investigators who make up their results stopped doing clinical trials.<p>The other point is that in most areas, there are only a few acceptable clinical trial endpoints. For example in cancer studies, there are really only 3: overall survival (time alive), event free survival (time until the cancer comes back or starts growing) and response rate (% of cases where the tumour shrinks by 20% or more). Cardiology is a bit different because there is less consensus about valid endpoints. Nevertheless, clinicians and regulatory bodies are pretty strict about which endpoints they consider meaningful.<p>So in my opinion the authors chose the subject area that would give them the most &#x27;shocking&#x27; result (Cardiology, due to having more options for endpoints), glossed over the interpretation (why such a big difference in the gold standard endpoint that is supposed to be immune to manipulation?), and over-hyped the significance of the result.",1439944911

10083074,comment,10080731,10082101,0,0,i336_,,,"Two things.<p>First of all, I think that both hosted and downloadable models are both equally viable, and IMHO both are worth pursuing simultaneously.<p>While I discuss the merits of a downloadable version below, first of all, staying hosted makes a lot of sense, not just because delivering all of npm is... <i>tricky</i> (kudos for managing to provide it :P), but also because it gives you the option to introduce a pricing structure in the future. (That said, please definitely do keep your current featureset free. XD)<p>A Google Maps Overlay[1]-style API could be a viable solution for developers who choose to use your hosted system who also need access to local resources: I&#x27;m thinking something SSL-encrypted (using symmetric keys configured via a dashboard), and perhaps a small (opensource, auditible) endpoint library that connects to your server (over WebSocket or XHR, to work around pesky firewalls), which the developer would be able to connect to the relevant bits of their data with a minimum of SLOC. (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s outrageously unsuitable - it&#x27;s probably only useful as an idea - but Netflix&#x27; newly-released Falcor library[2] comes to mind.)<p>I also think a cut-down version of your system could be a very very interesting competitor to Jupyter/IPython, and it&#x27;s (reasonably) rare for competition to be a bad thing.<p>(Looking at the whole picture, there will undoubtedly be political types who will take one look at Jupyter/your system and <i>will</i> point out &quot;but one&#x27;s fully open source and one&#x27;s freemium,&quot; but nobody would be able to argue that, done right, freemium does undeniably have more resources going into it, and the developers involved get to work on something awesome AND go home to a full kitchen at the end of the day, which does sort of guarantee a certain consistent level of quality.)<p>In this model, you would have this hosted version with ALL THE PACKAGES (wow!) - and maybe some awesome paid features down the track - along with a slightly smaller-scale Github repo that people can clone and fire up locally.<p>Besides being &quot;trendy&quot;, the downloadable version would be a boon for people who, for whatever reason, MUST have an air gap in their systems for whatever security purposes, but happen to be using Node for their work.<p>Finally, it&#x27;d be cool to offer the local version as both a loopback web server (for a standard browser) <i>as well as</i> an Electron[3]-based &quot;standalone console&quot;. That puts you visually on par with IPython web notebooks and QtConsole.<p>Oh, and speaking of UI, one other thing would be to keep the downloadable version&#x27;s UI as identical to the hosted version as possible, in both look and feel: it&#x27;d be a neat little mind trick to make devs feel like they&#x27;re running your hosted version locally :P<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/overlay-simple"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://netflix.github.io/falcor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netflix.github.io/falcor/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/atom/electron"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/atom/electron</a>",1439944670

This conversation is going to be fucking tedious if you continue to refuse to accept that.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to see the relevance of your cycling document. It doesn&#x27;t mention air pollution as a risk (perhaps I missed it?) to cyclists; it&#x27;s about cycling; so it has no relevance to a discussion about the risk of running in London pollution.

the extent to which American farmers have been impacted by litigation arising
from the use of patented genetically engineered crops. After extensive
research and numerous interviews with farmers and lawyers, CFS found that
Monsanto, the world’s leading agricultural biotechnology company, has used
heavy-handed investigations and ruthless prosecutions that have fundamentally
changed the way many American farmers farm. The result has been nothing
less than an assault on the foundations of farming practices and traditions
that have endured for centuries in this country and millennia around the
world, including one of the oldest, the right to save and replant crop seed.</i><p><i>The largest recorded judgment made thus far in favor of Monsanto as
a result of a farmer lawsuit is $3,052,800.00. Total recorded judgments
granted to Monsanto for lawsuits amount to $15,253,602.82. Farmers have
paid a mean of $412,259.54 for cases with recorded judgments. </i><p><i>No farmer is safe from the long reach of Monsanto. Farmers have
been sued after their field was contaminated by pollen or seed from someone
else’s genetically engineered crop; when genetically engineered seed from a
previous year’s crop has sprouted, or “volunteered,” in fields planted with
non-genetically engineered varieties the following year; and when they
never signed Monsanto’s technology agreement but still planted the patented
crop seed. In all of these cases, because of the way patent law has been
applied, farmers are technically liable. It does not appear to matter if the use
was unwitting or a contract was never signed</i>",1439942706

Most of the parts of the world with the most resource abundance have very low or negative natural growth rates, with the overall growth in those areas driven by immigration from places with less abundance rather than natural increase, and we have very good information that strong social support networks promote reduced rates of natural population growth. We know quite well how to control growth in the context of resource abundance.",1439942449

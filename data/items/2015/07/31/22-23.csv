How does FFTW work?<p>The innovation (if it can be so called) in FFTW consists in having a variety of composable solvers, representing different FFT algorithms and implementation strategies, whose combination into a particular plan for a given size can be determined at runtime according to the characteristics of your machine/compiler. This peculiar software architecture allows FFTW to adapt itself to almost any machine.<p>For more details (albeit somewhat outdated), see the paper &quot;FFTW: An Adaptive Software Architecture for the FFT&quot;, by M.

That, in turn, led to an\n  unusually fat fuselage that is so high it completely \n  obstructs the rear of the canopy.\n\n  Subsequently, when the Air Force and the Navy were enticed \n  into joining the F-35 program — supposedly to benefit from \n  the “savings” of a large 2,500 unit tri-service buy (savings \n  that quickly turned into huge cost overruns) — they both \n  had to accept the fat fuselage and lack of rearward \n  visibility of the Marine Corps version.

Unlike conventional methods, acoustic energy transfer is able to achieve energy transfer at high efficiencies over distances that are large in comparison to the dimensions of the transmitter and the receiver. This paper gives an overview of the principle and explains the different loss mechanisms that come into play. A theoretically limit on the achievable efficiency is calculated. It exceeds that of a comparable inductively coupled system by an order of magnitude. First preliminary measurements indicate that AET is feasible, although the measured efficiency is lower than the predicted theoretical limit.<p>URL: <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119486&isnumber=6119266"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611948...</a><p>Update: I was able to get a 5 minute preview of the paper from DeepDyve.com [1&#x27;]. They got 53% efficiency at 1 meter, but that was at very low power (something like 37 uW). They weren&#x27;t using particularly high powered transducers, though, so could have gotten more power if that had been what they were aiming for, but probably still a long way from charging a phone. They say that the challenge for acoustic energy transfer will be in developing the high power transducers that will be needed.<p>[1&#x27;] For those who have not heard of DeepDyve, they provide access to a very large number of journal articles for prices that are much lower than what the journals charge for individual articles. Yes, I know that ideally all of this stuff should be available to the public for free, but until that happens DeepDyve is worth considering. They have a &quot;Freelancer&quot; plan that costs nothing up front, and gives you 5 minute full previews of articles. You can purchase &quot;tokens&quot; in packs of 5 for $20. You can rent an article for 30 days for one token. They also have a $40/month subscription plan that lets you read unlimited articles, and gives a discount if you want to buy a PDF.

Depending on where you put the unknown, there are several ways to ask the same arithmetic question, eg:<p><pre><code>    _ + 2 = 5\n    3 + 2 = _\n    3 + _ = 5\n</code></pre>\nUsing the rods to model the knowns and unknowns has been really helpful for her to connect the abstract ideas of the equations with the reality of what the numbers mean, and how the manipulations work on each side of the equality.<p>Overall I think they&#x27;re a pretty powerful tool, but they require some creativity to really get the most value from them, and they definitely require the use of other learning aids in conjunction like number lines, 99-charts, and base-ten blocks.

This is like claiming that GHG is from &quot;many thousands of years ago&quot; because people made wood fires back then.</i><p>Actually most agricultural land clearing did happen many hundred to thousands of years ago. People have proposed that all the carbon released by this activity did have an impact on the planet and this prevented us from re-entering another ice age. I am not too sure how much evidence supports this hypothesis as the amount of carbon released was relatively low until we started burning fossil fuels in the last century.<p><i>Yes, and if you asked me for a guess I&#x27;d say the scale of the farming &quot;experiment&quot; is much greater. I&#x27;m interested to hear reasons you believe the opposite is true, not just an assertion.</i><p>The effect of farming has probably had more impact to date on the planet, but it is not as large as what the GHG experiment will have on the planet if we do nothing.<p><i>We do? Are you saying that you understand the true future effect of one change to a very complex non-linear system?</i><p>Actually the effect of adding GHG is very easy to predict - it increases the amount of energy trapped in a concentration dependent effect. What is hard to model is what the precise effect will be and when it will happen. A nice analogy to use is what will happen if you drive your car at 100 mph into a brick wall without wearing a seat belt or having an airbag. You can’t predict in advance what will happen to you, but none of the likely outcomes will be good.<p><i>Similar to the last point, but this should be followed by &quot;according to [Researchers&#x27;] model&quot; and not left as a plain assertion.</i><p>Under the &quot;do-nothing” model (effectively our current model) we just keep burning all the fossil fuels until they are all gone. We do have a pretty good idea of how much fossil fuels we can extract and so it is easy to calculate how much CO2 will be released if we burn them all. Unfortunately all the changes to the model over the last few years is much of the fossil fuels we thought were uneconomic to extract (and so were not counted as being releasable) have proven extractable (i.e. fracking and shale oil).<p><i>Please name the model or whatever logical progression you are using to arrive at this idea, too</i><p>My model is our current “do-nothing” model where all the fossil fuels that can be burnt will be burnt. The end outcome of this is a CO2 concentration north of 1200ppm. While we can’t predict exactly what will happen if we reach this level we do have a pretty good idea from the past that it won’t be nice.",1438380473

My two options, in <i>any language</i>—whether that language has generics or not—are: (1) write specialized code for every type I want to use it with (go generate), potentially bloating the code and resulting in extra compilation time; (2) use some sort of existential type (interface{} in Go) and share the code but pay a performance cost at runtime. The dilemma arises because of the <i>problem itself</i>, not because of generics.<p>It is of course right that there is a tradeoff here (although there are many other potential solutions that aren&#x27;t at one extreme or the other, .NET-style JIT compilation or intensional type analysis for example). But not having generics doesn&#x27;t eliminate the tradeoff. Generics are just a way for the compiler to automate the work that a programmer would otherwise have to do. If you don&#x27;t have generics, you still have that dilemma, except that you have to write the code yourself instead of the compiler doing it for you.",1438380039

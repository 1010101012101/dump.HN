2057406,comment,2057352,2057352,0,0,ajays,,,"Oh come on! In 2005, Facebook was barely out of colleges. Memory's fuzzy, but till about late 2004/early 2005, you could join Facebook only if you had a .EDU address. So expecting Googlers to be Facebook users is a bit disingenuous . Plus, 2005 was over 5 years ago; things have changed since then.<p>Just because it's an ex-Googler it does not make his (her?) statements the gospel truth.<p>If there's something to be said, it is that Google underestimated the network effect: that if most of your social circle is on a social network, then you automatically have a large incentive to join it.",1293872111

I think it has a chance to grab a decent chunk of the social networking market.  If that doesn't work, they've also got a lot of cash sitting around to buy a few companies that do have the right idea.",1293870305

It's just a matter of prioritizing your time correctly.  There doesn't need to be all of this WoW is a drug you need to cut it off completely or else you'll be a fat gamer that hasn't gone anywhere in life.<p>All of this WoW bashing could easily apply to several other things where people don't take in moderation, like alcohol, watching football, etc.",1293869628

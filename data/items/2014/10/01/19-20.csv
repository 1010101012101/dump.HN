8397292,comment,8396375,8397226,17,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That doesn&#x27;t add up. By all estimates there are many millions of people addicted to drugs or alcohol in the US alone (as many as 20+ million). If we are to assume that the article&#x27;s premise that addictions tend to have a lifespan of about 15-20 years or so is due to the fact that the addicts are dying then that would correspond to something like a million deaths per year. In the sub-45 year old population that would absolutely swamp every other cause of death.",1412193563

8397290,comment,8396356,8396926,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I had an unhealthy obsession with IQ testing. A phase long ago. I remember reading that the average Harvard IQ tested at 130 and the other Ivies in the mid-120s. You can guess based on SAT figures, noting that extracurricular factors (paradoxically) decrease the IQ/SAT correlation (people who beat a top school&#x27;s extracurricular game are more likely than average to have prepped for SATs and have scores that overstate their IQs). So a 1500 average SAT (out of 1600) ends up mapping to a group average IQ around 130, even though a typical individual with a 1500 SAT is probably around 140 IQ.<p>These numbers fluctuate and it&#x27;s quite possible that the increasing usage of socioeconomic/extracurricular criteria has decreased the gap.",1412193546

Automobiles go hither and yon, wherever and whenever the driver desires, without timetables. Automobiles encourage people to think they—unsupervised, untutored, and unscripted—are masters of their fates. The automobile encourages people in delusions of adequacy, which make them resistant to government by experts who know what choices people should make.<p>Time was, the progressive cry was “Workers of the world unite!” or “Power to the people!” Now it is less resonant: “All aboard!”&quot;<p>So, to some people, trains are a Euro-socialist kind of thing, anti-freedom.",1412193500

8397275,comment,8396637,8396637,4,0,Dewie,,,"My attitude towards charity is kind of the opposite. If I am to donate to charity, I want to concentrate on one or a few things, so that I&#x27;m able to actually research them and see for myself whether I think that the money will come to good use.<p>This kind of thing is different from people going door to door, collecting money; instead of someone actively going to <i>you</i> in order to convince you to give to some &quot;good&quot; (according to them) cause, <i>you</i> are the active participant. There isn&#x27;t much immediate social guilt of having to say &quot;no&quot;, in this case. People who collect for charities in the usual, door to door or through other means of confronting people probably want to play on people&#x27;s feeling of social dignity and that they don&#x27;t want to appear to be stingy. So then the average person ends up giving to a lot of different charities - because they all ask for a little at a time - and knowing little about each one.<p>But why would I <i>deliberately</i> want to diversify my charity, if <i>I&#x27;m</i> the one who is actively subscribing to it? Isn&#x27;t it better to research a few good ones, and actively pursue those? Why give up that choice to some other entity, and make it practically impossible for me to keep up with all the different causes (you can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t feel motivated to research where every dollar you give goes to, when it all goes to different things).

8397270,comment,8394136,8396648,26,0,rbehrends,,,"To go into more detail, here&#x27;s the typical lecture format at a German university (note that this is &quot;typical&quot;, not universal, and professors have a lot of leeway in how they can structure their courses).<p>There&#x27;ll be a lecture twice a week (four &quot;semester hours&quot;, 2 times 2 * 45 minutes) and a two semester hour exercise session. The lecture will be held by a professor [1]; the exercise session for undergraduate courses will generally be conducted by a TA in smaller groups.<p>More often than not there won&#x27;t be a textbook, except for heavily standardized courses (or where the professor chooses to pick one). You&#x27;ll work off the professor&#x27;s lecture notes and any notes that you took yourself (sometimes the lecture notes are basically a textbook by themselves, but that&#x27;s obviously a lot of work for a professor). The lecture notes may recommend additional literature, which is generally available through the library&#x27;s course reserves (and out of which students will photocopy anything they consider relevant; private copies short of wholesale copies of books are generally legal in Germany) or online (in the case of individual papers).<p>You&#x27;ll get homework once a week, distributed as printouts during the lecture (and/or available on the course website).  Students are encouraged to work on homework in groups and to even turn in their results as a group.<p>Homework will be graded, but it doesn&#x27;t count towards your final grade; instead, you will be required to get 50% of the total points to be admitted to the final exam (this is more an incentive than an actual threshold). You can generally even copy the results from somewhere else (you&#x27;re doing homework as preparation for the exam, so you&#x27;re only hurting yourself if you do it).<p>Homework will be returned and reviewed during the exercise session, usually with either the TA or one of the students presenting the solution to each question on the blackboard and discussing it.<p>Your entire grade will be derived from the final exam (some courses these days have two exams, one midterm and one final exam so that your entire grade doesn&#x27;t ride on one day&#x27;s performance). Some courses may also have an oral rather than a written exam.<p>There generally won&#x27;t be grading on a curve (though the professor can adjust the grades if the exam turned out to be harder than intended). If you fail to meet the standards that the university expects of its students, you fail. German professors won&#x27;t shy away from letting most of the students in a course fail (though they will likely be sad when that happens). That&#x27;s the price of a mostly open admission system combined with the university&#x27;s desire to maintain its academic reputation.<p>In addition to lectures, there will be (depending on the subject), seminars, lab courses, etc. You will also have to write a thesis (including for a Bachelor&#x27;s degree).<p>In general, there&#x27;s very little handholding (that&#x27;s not specific to Germany, though). You&#x27;re expected to be able to both study independently and work productively in a group (skills that you should have learned in school) without needing support.<p>[1] Using the term &quot;professor&quot; broadly to include &quot;privatdozenten&quot; etc.",1412193403

8397266,comment,8392138,8392413,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Hi! I use F# for most tasks (from websites/JS generation, to packet capture and indexing, call routing and billing processing), and some C where required. Rust looks fantastic, and would give me the memory control I need when I need extra performance. A LOT of it comes down to simply being able to stack-allocate things; in F# I&#x27;m essentially forced to use the GC heap for even the most trivial things.<p>Rust looks fantastic, and I&#x27;m very excited about using it. When I found out about it and started reading how it worked, it was almost exactly what I had been wanting, on almost every count. I really wish it had existed a few years ago.<p>My comments are from someone that&#x27;s just been playing around with the getting started guide of Rust.<p>-- Lack of custom operators limits expressiveness. For instance, look at Parsec or FParsec. Why shouldn&#x27;t they be allowed to exist in Rust? But if custom operators <i>are</i> totally out of the question, then what about user-defined infix functions? (And then, why not functions with nearly arbitrary codepoints as identifiers?)<p>-- It seems that currying, partial application, and function composition are sorta cumbersome in Rust. Is this a conscious decision, that idiomatic Rust shouldn&#x27;t be doing such things? Like &quot; add >> inc >> print &quot; being equivalent to &quot;|a,b| -> print(inc(add(a,b)))&quot; ? In F# I use this kind of stuff all the time, especially when processing lists.<p>-- It seems there&#x27;s a difference between function types. Like if I do &quot;fn foo(a:int, f:proc(int)->int)&quot;, I can call it with foo(1i, inc) if inc is a fn. But if I first do &quot;let f = inc; foo(i1, f)&quot;, that&#x27;s an error. Offhand, I&#x27;d assume this is due to lifetime management, but it feels a bit strange. When writing HoFs, do I need to implement a version for each kind of function? Or am I totally misunderstanding things?<p>-- Sorta related, does Rust allow something like:<p><pre><code>  let inc =\n    let x = ~0\n    || { let res = *x; *x += 1; res }\n</code></pre>\nThe idea is to expose a function that contains some private state. I remember hearing that Rust changed the ownership stuff around a few times, but the basic idea is to create a globally-accessible closure. Is this impossible, requiring us to use statics to store the global state?<p>-- Why doesn&#x27;t Rust warn when discarding the result of a function if not unit? Is it idiomatic Rust to return values that are often ignored?<p>-- Even without higher kinded types, monadic syntax is useful. Is Rust planning any sort of syntax that&#x27;d let users implement Option or Async? How does Rust avoid callback hell? Or is this quite possible today with macros and syntax extensions?<p>-- Has Rust considered Active Patterns (ala F#)? With that, I can define arbitrary patterns and use them with matching syntax. E.g. define a Regex pattern, then &quot;match s { Regex(&quot;\d&quot;) => ... , Regex(&quot;\D&quot;) => ... , _ => ... }&quot;<p>-- Consider allowing trailing commas in declarations; why special-case the last item?<p>-- And last but not least: Please, please, <i>please</i>, reconsider type inference. It&#x27;s baffling why &quot;fn&quot; requires type annotations, but a closure does not. What&#x27;s more, why is there even different function syntax in the first place? I&#x27;ve heard the reason that &quot;top level items should have types documented&quot;, but that&#x27;s a very personal decision to make. It certainly isn&#x27;t something the Rust compiler should force me to do in all my code. Why do ya gotta limit <i>my</i> expressiveness? (Same argument I&#x27;d use for custom operators.) Statics/consts should also have type inference. And note that these items aren&#x27;t necessarily public or exposed - but a private fn on a module still requires type annotations.",1412193378

It has also given us access to a rather impressive network of very smart people who can help us. Yes, there is a trade-off in that our investors have a say in what we do, but given the small number of investors, and who they are individually, there is a low probability of micromanagement from them. Secondly, we never promised Hacker News that we&#x27;re going to change the world; we said we have some ambitious ideas, and that we wanted to pursue them. Might they change the world? Sure. Might we also die trying? Absolutely. That&#x27;s a risk inherent to... well, everything. Certainly a lot of things worth doing.<p>> The fact that the LT team is giving up on Light Table/I think the LT team should have worked themselves into a crying, bleeding, starving mess<p>The last time we had office hours with pg about LT, we didn&#x27;t exactly leave with a warm fuzzy feeling about continuing work on the project. But we did, for another year, spending the remainder of the Kickstarter money and approaching the end of the runway, staying as lean as possible, and continuing to develop a product that pg, James Lindenbaum, et al, all regarded as a nonviable business. We may have to agree to disagree on how plausible it is to make an open source IDE a commercial success, but there was plenty of crying and bleeding before we came to work on Eve.<p>At that point, it became what Jamie aptly described as a matter of return on effort. There isn&#x27;t much sensibility in spending countless hours to solve the wrong problem, and running out of money didn&#x27;t strike us as the optimal way to continue working on a problem we genuinely cared about. Instead, once LT became open source, we forged ahead into an area that Chris Dixon called a &quot;Vietnam&quot; of software, and while Eve may be particularly difficult, it brought us new funds precisely so we <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to give up.<p>> I truly hope they succeed<p>Thank you, so do we :)",1412193107

Having worked mostly with math professors, I would say the code they write almost exclusively belongs to the car-mechanic school. Math professors never deck up their code with CT. The majority of the time a math prof has to write code, its to do heavy-duty applied math, engg stuff ( solve pde&#x27;s, fluid mechanics, EE math, fourier transforms, gradients etc. ) or to display some cool visualization to the students ( here&#x27;s how a vector space looks! here is what happens when you apply linear transformation!! here are all the elements of a quotient group!!! ) - those tend to be done in Matlab/Mathematica/Maple/Gap...and these tools have zero CT. The applied stuff tends to use netlib, gams, gsl, colt, apache math...mostly a lot of gsl these days...again no CT there.

But I posted it in part because I seriously loathe the AA &quot;disease&quot; model.<p>My dad drank heavily when he was in the army. He fought in the front lines of two wars. I think he did it at least in part so he could sleep because alcohol helps suppress dreams (and, thus, also nightmares). About four years after he left the army, he swore off alcohol and basically never touched it again.<p>I loathe the taste of alcohol and, for most of my life, rarely have touched the stuff. But I did have a nightcap almost every night for a year at a time when I was very ill and doctors didn&#x27;t really know what to do for me. At some point in there, it was not unusual for me to have two doubles with dinner -- the equivalent to four drinks. So I imagine I could have been classified as an alcoholic at that time. But when I got some answers and started getting healthier, I was happy to stop drinking. Like my father, I never attended AA, never wrestled with trying to resist temptation or whatever, etc.<p>In my father&#x27;s case, I think it helped with psychological trauma. In my case, it helped me survive illness at a time when I didn&#x27;t have good answers and wasn&#x27;t getting adequate medical treatment. I have read or heard plenty of other stories that look to me like they fit one of those categories.<p>So I think the article oversimplifies things in suggesting it is just a developmental disorder, but I am thrilled to see a piece talking about the reality that most folks drink less as they get older, without getting any treatment.

At large state schools, there are professors doing real research.  The difference with the ivy leagues is very few students actually seek these experiences out.  (I was one of four undergrads applying for a paid research position during my Big School CS undergrad.  I got it as a sophomore because the competition was weak.)  I still would have had a better experience at Stanford or MIT, but I think it&#x27;s more a peer effect.<p><i>But instead that produced this arms race of people seeking lots of extra academic experiences purely for the sake of getting into college and then burning out and not wanting to continue once they got there.</i><p>This is very true.

You&#x27;ll help humans effectively manage hundreds of campaigns for well-known brands and retailers. We serve 50+ million ads every day and process 3.5 billion transactions, and you&#x27;ll be right in the thick of it. You&#x27;ll work directly with Postgres, Redis, HBase and Hadoop. You&#x27;ll also likely play a key role in developing a new API for several key partners.<p>2) We need someone with fierce tenacity to run QA and technical ad operations. When an account manager sees that we recorded no clicks for a certain campaign in Firefox browsers, you&#x27;ll get to hunt down the resolution. You&#x27;d bring a meticulous eye for detail to bear with browser and Javascript chops. Done well, you&#x27;ll be a daily hero. (Devs are cheerful when called upon to fight fires, but prefer to write code.) Count on becoming well acquainted with Hive.<p>3) Finally, we&#x27;re looking for a strong DevOps team member. You know networking and Linux very well. You&#x27;ll help improve our Hadoop clusters. You&#x27;ll tune monitoring and alerting thresholds. Most importantly, you&#x27;ll eagerly seek to expand your usefulness as you work with the rest of the dev team. We&#x27;re not driven by dogma, and you&#x27;ll find yourself in good company if your sole priority is fixing the problem at hand.<p>I&#x27;m one of the lead devs, and you can reach me at dlarsen@connexity.com.

The signal would be weak:<p>1) The gamma ray spectrum from GRBs looks like it has a long high-energy tail: <a href=""http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/lectures/ADSEM/WS0304_Kienlin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/lectures/ADSEM/WS0304_Kienlin...</a><p>2) For gamma energies about about 8 MeV, you start producing neutrons from gamma-nucleus interactions (this is why cancer patients who are treated with high-energy beams are very slightly radioactive for a while after each treatment: high energy photons blow neutrons out of a few of their nuclei, leaving short-lived daughter nuclei in their place.)<p>3) For an extinction-level gamma-ray event the GRB fluxes are estimated as ~10 kW/m^2 as the top of the atmosphere and 160 W/m^2 at the surface of the exposed side of the Earth. That&#x27;s 160/1.6E-13 = 1E15 MeV/s.m^2. If 10E-6 gammas generate a neutron (totally ballpark guess, but the spectrum is only down by about 1E-3 from peak at around 10 MeV, and neutron production cross-sections at around 10 MeV are on the order of a milli-barn for nitrogen and some heavier elements, so a 1E-3 fraction going into neutron production is not unreasonable) that&#x27;s 1E9 neutrons/m.s. Given GRBs last for a couple of seconds, therefore, one would expect to see a layer of neutron-activated rock that was exposed to a fair neutron flux.<p>4) But... all rock is exposed to a background flux of a few neutrons per second, so over a few hundred years there would be a background signal that swamped this burst signal.<p>Ergo, it is unlikely that this mechanism could be used to detect a signature of GRB extinction events on Earth. The additional neutron activation signal would be completely swamped by the natural background signal in almost any reasonable circumstances.",1412192581

I know this sounds harsh, but when I run across someone who is at the top of their profession and yet seems woefully underwhelming, they often have Ivy League BAs in non-demanding majors (For example, Jeff Zucker, Harvard, History. John Tierney, Yale, American Studies). My working hypothesis is that, while everyone who graduates from an elite school has an advantage in terms of reputation and networks, the actual difficulty of completing certain degrees isn’t that high relative to non-elite schools. Thus a history degree from Harvard isn’t worth that much more than a history degree from a Cal State school.</i><p>This has been my experience.

But that doesn&#x27;t mean function calls are slow, or that we need Sufficiently Smart Compilers just to use map efficiently.<p>What it means is that abstractions should be designed with both the use and the implementation in mind. One way to do that is &quot;zero-cost abstractions&quot; a la C++, where the abstractions are pretty minimal. Another way is things like stream fusion and tco, where it&#x27;s easy to accidentally stray out of the efficiently representable subset.<p>But there are a lot of ways to get abstractions that are both higher-level and &quot;zero-cost&quot; (generating the code you would have if you hadn&#x27;t used them). For example, Python generators and C# iterators (coroutine-looking functions internally transformed into state machines) look a lot like Haskell higher-order functions but the benefits of laziness and stream fusion and tco are just built into the abstraction, rather than optimizations that may or may not happen, depending on the language/compiler. They also turn out to be more flexible, since the iterator state is reified.<p>Another example is entity-component systems in game engines. You still get a nice abstraction of game-world objects composed from behaviors, like you might see in an OO hierarchy, but the cache behavior is vastly improved and the behaviors are again more flexible.",1412192065

But my impressions are, sure, if your idea of the &quot;education&quot; part of college is to (sometimes) go to classes required for your degree and do exactly what the instructor tells you and that&#x27;s it, probably it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference in terms of academics where you went to school. Everybody uses (almost) the same textbooks, after all. And academic jobs are scarce enough that two instructors of the same subject at very different institutions may actually have had similar undergraduate educations and approaches to undergraduate teaching.<p>What ivy league and other private research universities excel at academically is scholarly opportunities outside class assignments. If you want to reconstruct 17th century pipe organs or build robotic insects or experiment on extremophiles in Greenland or whatever, there might very well be someone who wants a student to help with something like that. Plus they probably have money to cover your expenses and pay you a stipend for it, and you don&#x27;t have to compete with 500 other people for the chance. More generally, if there is a particular academic topic you as a student want to learn all about, a top university has a better chance than most places of having someone or something that can help you. But the student has to show up with the initiative and persistence to get that.<p>The hard part is admissions: what&#x27;s the best way to find students who will of their own volition seek this kind of thing out? The simple answer would seem to be to look for kids who have a history of doing that and succeeding. But instead that produced this arms race of people seeking lots of extra academic experiences <i>purely for the sake of getting into college</i> and then burning out and not wanting to continue once they got there.",1412191942

However I think in doing so it would destroy &quot;Dollar a Day&#x27;s&quot; USP.<p>To me the USP of &quot;Dollar a Day&quot; is: Completely hassle free donating at an affordable cost ($30/month) which gives you almost endless positive feedback (i.e. every day you&#x27;re reminding of why you&#x27;re a &quot;good person&quot;).<p>As soon as you start adding complexity then the USP changes from &quot;completely hassle free&quot; to &quot;something I have to check every single day.&quot; Plus people will have to grasp how the whole skip system works (e.g. if I skip a day, is it still $30/month? If it is then where does that $1 go? What if I skip tons of days? What if I don&#x27;t redistribute that $1 by the end of the month, where does it go, etc).<p>So I agree with your point, but I disagree that &quot;Dollar a Day&quot; should implement it. Instead they should stick to their USP and make very sure they don&#x27;t mis-fire on the charity selection front (e.g. &quot;Today is a $1 donation to the Republican Party,&quot; &quot;Today is a $1 donation to Susan G.

We never (to my knowledge) developed any actual keyloggers, but we would do other equally insecure things with end users&#x27; data. For example, sending browser cookies, registry values, files off the hard drive, etc. in plain text to databases on our servers for later analysis.<p>Getting this kind of software through spyware screens in antivirus programs is not too difficult. Some of the antivirus companies have automated processes by which you can upload your binaries to them as false-positives and they&#x27;ll automatically whitelist them for you. Sometimes it requires a quick email or phone call to the appropriate person at the antivirus company. Occasionally you have to make changes (usually just adding more disclaimers to an already ridiculously long EULA) in order to satisfy them and get on the whitelist.

I think making the compromises needed to do be able to do both adequately would be too much to make either task worthwhile. Maybe that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be true for digital, like ePub, but I think that would quickly become true for print.<p>I don&#x27;t feel a typesetting interface/context is amenable to writing long-form documents. When I take into consideration multi-column layouts, running headers and footers, art wrapping, page flow across multiple pages, there are what appears to be a lot of potential distractors from the writing process. Word processing documents, when I hide as much of the interface as I can, allow for the tight focus needed for long-form writing. Someone else in this thread suggested having writing and editing happen in another window, but that&#x27;s still creating an abstraction from the layout, and not really having edits happen &quot;in real time&quot; if only because then editing is not happening actually within the layout.<p>Finally, I think there would be a significant barrier to training for many authors trying to work in layouts. There are applications, like QuarkXpress, that enable word-processing-like tools in the layout. But I couldn&#x27;t imagine asking an author to learn enough about the above to ask them to write a long-form paper, much less an entire book, in that environment.

But later in life you will compare yourself with others, your colleagues, your friends, and you might feel inferior, unfishied. Something will be missing, especially that you are at the end of the road, you&#x27;re almost done.<p>The things you talk about are quite ambitious. Let&#x27;s make a comparison with filmmaking world. If you are about to graduate from a film school, you are not supposed to make your first movie as good as some of the Old Masterpieces, or a big budget Holywood movie. You are supposed to make a soap opera episode - just get things simple and right - correct shots, correct lighting, well paced, clearly structured plot. And so should be the graduation work you are facing now.<p>And finally - there are many moments when the formal diploma is required from you. For instance immigration and changing countries. Being an engineer opens a lot of doors, makes it A LOT easier to get a working permit/visa. There are certain types of jobs that require formal education - and without it you will not even be considered a candidate. Right now you are probably young, single and it&#x27;s not a problem for you to be a contractor and have less stability, but later you&#x27;d get married, have children, take a mortgage, and then having a well paid job and organised life in a big corporation is not a bad thing at all.<p>And moreover catching up with the degree later in life is really difficult.<p>So, honestly, just finish it.

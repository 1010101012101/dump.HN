10653967,comment,10644987,10651101,0,0,lmmi,,,"Paper author here.  We measured &quot;effectiveness&quot; as the mutation score.  We showed in a separate paper that the mutation score is a good way to measure a test suite&#x27;s ability to detect real faults.  Of course, using the mutation score instead of the real fault detection rate does add a layer of indirection, but it&#x27;s a lot more practical for a large empirical study (i.e., can be automated), so there&#x27;s a bit of a tradeoff there.  (The other paper is also on my website if you want to read it: <a href=""http://www.linozemtseva.com/research/2014/fse/mutant_validity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linozemtseva.com/research/2014/fse/mutant_validit...</a>)<p>What the graphs show is that effectiveness rises with suite size, which is expected: more tests catch more bugs.  We also see that effectiveness rises with coverage, which seems intuitive: you can&#x27;t catch bugs in code you never run.  But when you graph effectiveness against coverage for suites that are all the <i>same</i> size, the correlation drops significantly, in some cases to 0.  Here&#x27;s an analogy: the number of PhD students that graduate in the US is highly correlated with the amount of profit generated by arcades in the US, but there&#x27;s no causal relationship between them.  They probably both depend on the size of the population.  Similarly, coverage and effectiveness are correlated because they both depend on the size of the suite, but we can&#x27;t say that there&#x27;s a causal relationship.  In other words, saying that a suite will catch a lot of bugs because it has high coverage is like saying that a lot of PhD students will graduate because arcades turned a good profit this year.<p>Your third point is a really good question.  It&#x27;s true that developers don&#x27;t write tests randomly, so our method of making new suites by picking random test cases isn&#x27;t quite realistic.  What impact that would have on the results, I&#x27;m not sure.  That&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to look into in the future.",1448952131

As soon as he clicked that debug link or the detail link, he was intentionally accessing information without authorized access. He knew he was not supposed to access that information and he did so anyways.<p>The CFAA has been used before for things not too far off for this. 3Tap[1] was found guilty of CFAA abuse when it scraped Craigslist after its IPs were banned.<p>Weev[2] was prosecuted under the CFAA for accessing unprotected AT&T customer data that was hidden behind a url with an incrementing integer ID (no password, no username, just a perl script to increment a url parameter in a get request).<p>This is a fairly well documented law that has been used a number of times and it&#x27;s almost certain that the author is guilty under it, as written.

Only so many entities have the ability to gather the kind of data necessary to separate fact from rumor.<p>In terms of incentives, blackmail is generally a lower tier crime in terms of likelihood of success. Think about if someone tried to blackmail you. There&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;d think &quot;Sure I can give in to their demands now, but they&#x27;ll just ask for something else later and they never have to stop asking&quot;. Unless the crime being covered up involves significant jail time, most people would rather face the consequences than live the rest of their lives under someone else&#x27;s control. Many former politicians have successful careers even after mundane scandals (Weiner and Spitzer come to mind).<p>And depending on the nature of the secret, most politicians would get some slack from the public for having the courage to standup to FBI blackmail. They might even be able to spin themselves as a flawed hero. In fact, having a three letter agency try to blackmail you right now is kind of a get out of jail free card.<p>As tptacek said, this is really fascinating fiction but it&#x27;s just wildly impractical in real life.

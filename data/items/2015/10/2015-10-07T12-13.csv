There&#x27;s a big difference between sitting at a piano with a tablet that you write on and a laptop with a keyboard and mouse. Even with a custom &quot;music keyboard&quot; getting the nuance of written music through digital input is slow, difficult and frustrating. For years we&#x27;ve been able to hook a keyboard into composition software, but writing in dynamics and other notation meant clicking through menus and sub-menus in crowded, tedious interfaces.<p>The ability to write as you think/feel it and have the computer handle digitization is a big step, and hopefully allows composers to just write, without working around their software&#x27;s limitations.",1444222796

But the Luddites themselves “were totally fine with machines,” says Kevin Binfield, editor of the 2004 collection Writings of the Luddites. They confined their attacks to manufacturers who used machines in what they called “a fraudulent and deceitful manner” to get around standard labor practices. “They just wanted machines that made high-quality goods,” says Binfield, “and they wanted these machines to be run by workers who had gone through an apprenticeship and got paid decent wages. Those were their only concerns.”</i><p>Read more: <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/#cFqIw584x2Gt01tx.99"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-real...</a>",1444222769

On one occasion I altered some code which broke this, and it added about 10-20 seconds to a 15 minute HFT simulation. If that code made it to prod, those 10-20 seconds would be distributed around the hot parts of an HFT system. That&#x27;s not remotely trivial, at least for performance critical applications (HFT, RTB, etc).<p>In the second example, basically what happens (if you get lucky - I haven&#x27;t found the JVM JIT to be super consistent) is that computation of cond and f(x) will be put into the pipeline together, and only the assignment to myVar will be conditional. This is strictly NOT something the CPU can do by itself, since there are side effects at the machine level (allocating objects, and then GCing them).",1444222724

I think that ReadyNow is very interesting because its existence points to some interesting consequences of JITs in performance sensitive domains.<p>The driving force behind ReadyNow (as I understand it) was that many performance sensitive systems needed to be fast out of the gates on start up. This means that an interpreted->compiled->optimised-compiled transition was not acceptable.<p>Developers would try to solve this by running dummy data through the system before it was open to real traffic. But this had the unfortunate consequence that the JIT would optimise for dummy data only, including clever inlining at, apparently, monomorphic call sites etc. When real traffic flows into the system the JVM sees that its optimisations are no longer effective/valid. This would trigger a de-compilation/re-compilation of many code sites causing a very noticeable stutter.<p>Now we have ReadyNow. If you are really committed to Java or the JVM and you don&#x27;t like these JIT stutters this is your solution. But this is an extra layer of complexity and another thing to be managed and another thing to fail. This is on top of your JVM, jar file soup you may already be struggling with.<p>I would prefer a good AOT compiler to remove this concern and give me quite good predictable performance. YMMV of course.<p>Sources<p><a href=""http://www.azul.com/products/zing/readynow-technology-for-zing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.azul.com/products/zing/readynow-technology-for-zi...</a><p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mechanical-sympathy/ReadyNow/mechanical-sympathy/QT_P5dGXjXw/W9uiT-dSqjMJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mechanical-sympat...</a>",1444220726

As a dynamic language, it&#x27;s certainly a good match for a JIT (run at once after a quick edit).  And that also explains why there can never be a standalone executable produced from Julia, since that would require AOT.  My guess is that Julia will dodge the Jitterdämmerung for a long time to come, if not forever.",1444220025

This is an approach GCC cannot take as it cannot install signal handlers, so at best it can do the check and mark the segfault path as unlikely.<p>GCC can do one better, given dereferencing null pointers is illegal it doesn&#x27;t need to handle that at all, and thus has no need to optimise something which doesn&#x27;t exist.",1444219612

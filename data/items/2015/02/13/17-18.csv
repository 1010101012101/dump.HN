Not just assume it&#x27;s because you&#x27;ve got smarter devs than them.  And in many cases, might require making some fundamental different decisions about scope, architecture, or other goals, than the first one did -- and sticking to them.<p>This is related to, and kind of a generalization of, the famous Joel &quot;rewriting software is a mistake&quot; argument, but shouldn&#x27;t be oversimplified to &quot;never bother trying to create new software that&#x27;s better than software already out there&quot;, of course.",1423850247

I was the IT director for a small pharmaceutical company that produced prescription creams and ointments and worked with a nearby university to work on new drugs.<p>My role was to develop the custom software that ran on laptops we gave to hospitals involved in the clinical trial.  In the drug manufacturing world, anytime computer software is used in a clinical trial or in the tracking of drug production, you have to have the software validated.<p>Software validation is basically a process by which you hire an outside company to go over what your software does.  Similar to an ISO certification.  The folks & companies you hire are very clueless... They know enough buzz words to ask good questions but they often over look things.<p>Anyway, long story short, the whole process of just collecting data is riddled with security problems.  None of this, as far as I know, is exposed to the public either.  So if buggy software is, somehow, corrupting test results, there is not feedback loop to correct or discard the data.  Companies like the one I worked for at the time, would throw out the data as a policy and start over.  Hence, very expensive situation and very crucial to make sure your systems do the right thing the first time.<p>This was in the late 90s and in one situation I was in charge of some software that we were developing that was expected run past Y2K.  Back then there was a lot of hoopla about the Y2K century roll over and what it would do to computer systems.<p>The company we hired validated our software for Y2K use cases but they often over looked basic things like data encryption, plain text storage of user passwords, etc...<p>I imagine the validation companies have gotten better over the years but in the end I learned that software validation is nothing more than a big CYA tactic.

My top recommendation would be OpenHack <a href=""http://openhack.github.io/new_york/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openhack.github.io/new_york/</a> While you don&#x27;t have a portfolio of projects on a website, you most likely still have them on your computer. OpenHack may be good place to showcase what you&#x27;re working on if someone shows interest. Those projects also come in handy for when you start landing interviews. I always took a computer to job interviews to showcase what I was working on and even did some live coding. There&#x27;s also another advantage to doing it this way: You are in control of the interview and I feel it&#x27;s a much better approach than sitting through a Q & A with a hiring team. It says, &quot;I came prepared.&quot;<p>For your first job, don&#x27;t undercut yourself on salary. At least make enough to live. Even if you find a company is horrible, you can still leave yourself open to other options. You might even land your next job, doubling your salary, through someone you worked with and recently left said horrible company. It may take your 2-3 employers to get to your desired salary.<p>I landed my first job through a random conversation with a neighbor (before that I was college dropout and an office temp for two months trying to land said job). It paid $28k and half of my month&#x27;s pay went to cover rent for a studio apartment. I ate PB&J and an apple every day for lunch. The job was copying text from Word documents and PDFs, marking them up with HTML. At the time, the company was building a hosting subsidiary. 2-3 nights a week, I spent 3-4 hours volunteering my time with that effort, through which I picked up Linux. I landed my second job through a previous co-worker. Every job offer I&#x27;ve ever taken started with an acquaintance.<p>My recommendation is to pick an area/skill set and focus on building that out. Looking at what you listed, I&#x27;d most likely recommend JavaScript for you. Take a look at a front end JS framework like Angular, Backbone, Knockout, or React. Maybe even try all of them out. Eventually, you might have questions. As you do, Open Hack might be a great place to get help and pick up a few pointers. As you become familiar with JavaScript, look to expand your horizons with a JS backend technology like NodeJS and look at exploring frameworks/platforms like Meteor, DerbyJS, or Express.<p>If you do decide to go the JavaScript route, here are some resources to get you started.<p><a href=""http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/</a><p><a href=""http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/contents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/contents.html</a><p><a href=""http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/</a><p><a href=""http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpattern...</a><p>JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford<p>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninga by John Resig<p>JavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov<p>As a side note, some of the most brilliant people I&#x27;ve worked with didn&#x27;t have CS degrees (Music, History, English, etc).

9045561,comment,9045239,9045239,0,0,trcollinson,,,"First, work on typing more professionally. I received my first paid programming position while I was still in high school working for a collection agency handling data. At the time I was very excited and they informed me that I got the position for a few reasons. First, I was relatively inexpensive. Second, I was very professional in my interview and my resume was light weight but highly polished. Third, I had some of the technical skills they needed, but they felt that with my professionalism and my work ethic I would be able to complete the work. They were right, I did well and I moved on from there.<p>So, for you, I will go down this list. First, set your salary expectation according to your experience. Have you had other, non-technical positions before? If so, get ready to leverage them appropriately. If not, get ready for a very low salary for your first position. It is highly unlikely you will make $80k on your first position.<p>Second, work on your professionalism. &quot;U&quot; is not a word. &quot;i&quot;, the first-person pronoun we all know and love, should be capitalized. You need to watch your punctuation. You don&#x27;t need to be perfect, but work on your writing and presentation skills. How you present yourself really does matter.<p>Where you should be perfect, or as close as possible, is in your resume. Make sure it is polished. Make sure it presents you well. When you go in for interviews look your best. Lately in our business there is an attitude that everyone can come in looking like they are hung over after a long night of coding followed by partying, dressed like a skater, and often riding on a skateboard. You can look like this as long as you have skills to back that image up. If you are really Junior, and you are, you better look like the type of guy who is going to show up on time and get his act together to get some work done.<p>Third, be ready to show off and discuss your technical skills and most importantly, how you are going to acquire more. They are taking a risk on hiring you. There is a cost to hiring, training, and letting a developer work on your code. You need to show you will provide more value then you take back. From what you write above, I think you will have no problem showing your value.<p>Finally, getting a job, any job, is a numbers game. Apply to 20 different positions. You will interview at a bunch and you will get the one job you are looking for. After that, learn all you can and then feel free to move on when the time, and your skills, are right.

I think what a really good home automation system ought to do is a bigger version of what the Nest does.<p>All of the light switches, blinds, alarms, climate control, music, TVs, etc could be manually controlled at first, but there&#x27;s a system that watches how you change all of them and coordinates it with your location and the time. It could look for patterns of doing several things in a row or doing them at the same time, and either offer to or just start doing them all together for you. Like you normally turn on lights 1, 2, and 3 when you walk in the door from work, so it notices and starts turning them on for you just from opening the door. Or you normally turn off lights 2 and 3 and turn on the DVD player within 5 minutes of each other, so it starts just turning off those lights when you turn on the DVD player.<p>Basically, something that notices what you already do and tries to do it for you, without you having to program things in with a smartphone or something. I bet normal people would love that. As long as it wasn&#x27;t laggy and buggy, of course, which could be easier said than done.",1423848683

Lion (released 2011) added &quot;bounce&quot; scrolling and auto-hiding scrollbars. It took them nearly half a year to fix the lack of auto-hiding scrollbars nightly builds[1], and even longer for it to finally make it to mainline Firefox. Firefox <i>still</i> doesn&#x27;t have bounce scrolling. To add to that point, the first high-dpi (retina) laptops were released in 2012, and nearly three years later, Firefox still contains a reasonable number of icons that aren&#x27;t in 2x (Retina) resolution. I suspect that these and other similar issues relate to the unfortunate decision to continue using a cross-platform UI toolkit (XUL).<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve also found that, despite Firefox&#x27;s distinction as the browser to popularize the idea of extensions, it now tends to lag in that department. Sure, you can get Adblock, but the stuff available on Chrome tends to be much more diverse these days. Finally, it&#x27;s still not multi-process (though it&#x27;s finally getting there.)

So either you inflate away everyone else&#x27;s original equity significantly to pay for new employees or you soon run out of equity.<p>The reason why the equity slices are low from what I understand is in the end of a VC funded company the numbers are something like %70 investors, %15 founders and %15 employees.

McSwain later conceded that he didn’t seek out independent expert advice to study the code Serge Aleynikov had taken. (“I relied on statements from Goldman employees.”) He himself had no idea of the value of the stolen code (“Representatives of Goldman told me it was worth a lot of money”) or if any of it was actually all that special (he based his belief that the code contained trade secrets on “representations made by members of Goldman Sachs”)...The F.B.I.’s investigation before the arrest consisted of trusting Goldman’s explanation of some extremely complicated stuff, and 48 hours after Goldman called the F.B.I., Serge was arrested.</i><p>That, as the complaint highlights, the FBI instinctively acted as Goldman&#x27;s punitive arm rather than conducting an independent investigation into the facts of the case is disturbing, regardless of the merit of the allegations.<p><a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman...</a>",1423846802

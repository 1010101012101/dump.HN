10542882,comment,10538489,10542752,0,0,rhino369,,,"I meant the former, but the later is also true. Though even great the MBA programs only take students with good work experience. However, it&#x27;s not impossible to change industries--e.x. bankers going into consulting. It&#x27;s hard to tell how much value the MBA actually adds. It&#x27;s hard to tell if they are just selecting the best and brightest, or if they actually teach something worthwhile. I suspect it&#x27;s a mixture of both.<p>I took a couple MBA courses at Kellogg when I was at Northwestern in another grad program. The ones I took weren&#x27;t real project work loads, but the courses delved into case studies of what companies did wrong and right during critical points in their history. Students would use real world experiences from their past to explain things. I took an IP asset management class with one of guys who sued Zuckerberg for allegedly ripping off HarvardConnect to make Facebook. Unfortunately he never talked about it. I was very curious.<p>Another large value of an elite MBA is the networking. How many billions of VC bucks have been dolled out to MBA grads at Stanford by people they met there?<p>In fact, the whole idea of an MBA program is somewhat similar to what YCombinator does.",1447192768

10542753,comment,10529716,10531449,0,0,manicdee,,,"Just remember to calculate the cost per kWh of electricity you extract from your battery.<p>This comes down to roughly:<p>$/kWh = $cost of installation / (kWh capacity * cycles lifetime * efficiency)<p>So if the Powerwall costs $5000 for a 7kWh capacity with a lifetime of about 3600 charge cycles at 80% efficiency, you&#x27;re looking at $0.25/kWh. If the difference between lowest and highest prices is lower than that, you&#x27;re better off not buying the Powerwall in the first place.<p>Once the difference between minimum and maximum price per kWh of electricity from the grid exceeds the $/kWh of the battery, you have an economic incentive to install the battery.<p>As the price of batteries comes down, companies will invest in battery peaking plants to take advantage of pricing on the energy market. Those bulk battery installations will limit the spread of wholesale time-of-day pricing such that it will never be economically sensible for home users to install batteries as a cost saving device based on retail time-of-day pricing. Domestic units will necessarily cost more per storage/output capacity than commercial units.<p>For the meantime, installing batteries for your home will only be useful for people who have problems with reliable access to electricity (e.g.: you have frequent brown-outs).<p>There are advances on the horizon thanks to new battery assembly technology, and Tesla Energy&#x27;s &quot;Gigafactory&quot; bringing economies of scale and integration into battery manufacturing, with an aim of reducing battery manufacturing costs around 30% for the former and 20% for the latter. There are also some theoretical (and in some cases lab proven) technologies to extend Lithium battery lifetimes to &quot;forever&quot;. These all alter the numbers in the equation above: a moderate decrease in $/kWh output will make batteries quite attractive for many grid-connected homes.<p>So &quot;watch this space,&quot; I guess.",1447191707

Otherwise, your security update might cause quite a bit of collateral damage. So, Microsoft is understandably cautious and afaict backports only fixes for major issues.<p>Of course, that gets complicated when you consider something like Chrome&#x27;s sandbox, which can depend on system guarantees that Microsoft may consider esoteric or just low-priority. To their credit, Microsoft is responsive when we find these kinds of issues and report them. However, it&#x27;s not uncommon for the issues to not be considered important enough to backport to legacy OSes (or for the task to just be too arduous).

I proposed similar things to a few people esp the partnership with hardware development, working around faulty (cheap) stuff, custom firmware, and kernel I/O modifications. I expected each of these in a high-end solution.<p>My architecture didn&#x27;t have an IP stack at all: guards or front-end acted as I.P. gateway while internally using <i>much simpler</i> protocol that still worked on Ethernet. Inspired by Active Messages and FLIR protocols of past. TCP/UDP/IP is unnecessarily complicated with simpler message passing easy in software and FPGA hardware for offloading onto cheap FPGA&#x27;s. A side note was using one or more I/O coprocessors like mainframe Channel I/O (see Wikipedia) to get huge throughput might be cost-effective depending on hardware selected. Esp if using embedded SOC for I/O offloading.<p>Note: Octeon II&#x27;s can do many Gbps of line-rate processing for three digits and <i>much simpler</i> internally than a lot of stuff.<p>The SASD project for secure, hard disks also suggested putting logic in the HD or SATA controllers rather than the system. Made me wonder about putting I/O mgmt and most storage logic in custom PCI cards with lots of SATA connectors. Basically, embedded systems enough CPU to manage whatever you throw at them, just running what&#x27;s good for that layer, and less watts/money than whole servers. Seems like at some point one could port that layer to straight hardware for great performance/watt although high, initial NRE. eASIC can do that relatively cheap, though, with the Nextreme&#x27;s if a design is FPGA-proven.<p>That was just exploration on paper so I&#x27;m not sure how practical it would be. My focus was high security systems and storage which necessitate better isolation. Hence, PCI cards rather than servers. Interesting that there was a lot of overlap, though, between what I thought made sense and what you all ended up doing. Very interesting.

There&#x27;s also possibilities for better density through solid state that may not make much sense from a raw $ / GB storage basis that drives Backblaze while tiered storage may be essential for how Dropbox operates. Also, I imagine it&#x27;d be possible to centralize and strengthen cooling while shoving a bunch of disks into a 4U box to increase raw drive density. For example, you could use a variant of peltier cooling to have drives chilled together off a single metal plate, then repeat a few times in a chassis.<p>So in short, I can think of improvements but most would come at the cost of higher capex to do so, and that could negatively impact the $ / GB numbers that Backblaze is trying to keep down. Perhaps there&#x27;s not much consideration for leasing datacenter real estate or power costs or something into the equations but without some reliable numbers it&#x27;s all speculation to me.",1447190081

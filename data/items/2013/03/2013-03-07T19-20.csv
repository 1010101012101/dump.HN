The ones at risk were people who came from school right into Google and found ""work"" to be not unlike academia. A friend of mine who was a VP over at another big tech firm in the valley at the time said they tried not to interview people whose first and only job was Google.<p>That said, I've also seen companies where folks have done many similar things to what Google has done (food, vacation options, variable salary packages) and made them work in non cash-rich environments.<p>The interesting difference is 'revenue per employee' or RpE which is an interesting metric to track. In information businesses where the product doesn't have a ""COGS"" in the traditional sense, it really is a function of the value that the employees are creating on a day in and day out basis. So you can model your expenses by using taking RpE as your gross revenue, then subtracting off salary, monthly benefits, vacation, and overhead to get your 'gross margin per employee' (GMpE) and if you choose to allocate some fraction of that margin into what I think of as ""lifestyle"" benefits (onsite massage, or snacks, or what not).<p>If you take that approach its possible to really talk in real terms about ""high tech"" work environment vs the business. As a founder/CEO/manager you can get a sense of when something is ""too much"" and when you can afford to loosen things up a bit.<p>That said, when Google employees were responsible for over $50,000 per quarter of free cash flow on a per capita basis, and Google decided to save a few cents by changing from OdWalla juice to an off brand, saving perhaps $250 per employee per quarter, I thought it was probably a pretty stupid move.",1362685879

And even if that number is somehow ""correct"" (each Tour is different and it is not possible to just numerically compare them) it does not mean the cycling is now clean, it does not even mean it's cleaner... there are too many factors that can influence this.<p>My opinion is this: cycling may be a bit cleaner in a sense that maybe doping is not as widespread as it used to be and maybe the effect of doping is more limited because they need to be more careful. But I don't believe cycling is clean now. There are new drugs that are undetectable and mentality has not changed.

They certainly compete against some (I would say many) riders who are not clean (some of them even got caught, like Frank Schleck) and they were not even competing on the same level - they were superior. I don't believe it is possible without doping. The fact that they claim otherwise on every occasion means nothing to me - I have seen this too many times.<p>My guess - and I realize it's nothing more than guess - is that if in 2030 they use their new methods to test today's samples they will find out that there is some substance that is undetectable today.<p>I would love to be proven wrong on this - I love cycling.",1362685616

How would you connect a web app, say a Ruby on Rails app, or a Django app if you're more comfortable with Python, to Armory to process Bitcoin payments?  There's a new feature that's <i>just</i> been merged that I see would allow Armory to be used on the web, but as far as I can tell, no one is using it in production.  But assuming this feature is production ready, how would you use Armory to process payments on the web?  Have you actually done this?  You're just mentioning a product and nothing about implementing payment processing.  The extra measures needed to set up payment processing are most decidedly non-trivial and should be detailed.<p>Finally, I should mention that Bitcoin Armory is under AGPL (even stricter than the GPL), which means that no serious business is going to use it for payment processing since they would have to open source whatever app they are connecting it to (it's just fine to use it to store a business's Bitcoins, however, since in this case, it's not connected to your application). From the BitcoinArmory site: ""Armory is licensed under the AGPL version 3, which guarantees that any derivative programs based on Armory source-code must also be open-source.""  bitcoind, on the other hand, is under the MIT license and can be freely used in commercial software without the obligation to share your source code.",1362684261

It's a pretty good deal, and it does what I need it to do; I have full control over it, I can give other people access to it, I can run any kind of website on it as long as I don't care too much about performance or uptime.<p>But there's no way I would run any service that was bringing in money on it. It basically has downtime every single month. Usually only for a few minutes at a time, and they tend to scrape by just barely exceeding 99.90%, but still. There also was one time when they emailed me saying there had been a power loss or some other reason that the rack my server was on went down, and I actually ended up having to go into the console to start my server back up and get everything working.<p>I've also found their support ... not particularly supportive.<p>Sure, Linode is 4x as expensive for the ""same thing"" (though to get Xen from my provider is only about 3x cheaper than Linode), but the amount of total money is negligible. $15/month. Maybe if I needed more resources it would be a difference of $100/month, but if I need a 4GB VPS for a service that's meant to make me money, that should still hopefully be trivial.

There are numerous instances, for example, of mothers of one species nursing the young of another species. Sometimes even of predator mothers nursing prey young. So, <i>prima facie</i>, assuming a reasonable definition of ""fairness"" it would seem that a vast number of species are capable of exhibiting this trait, including many of the ones you eat.<p>Second, it's also completely arbitrary. Why test for fairness? Why not ability to generate a profit on the stock market, or to do square roots, or tie shoes? It's a stupidly chosen metric that, at its heart, embodies circular logic -- choose a human trait, and then apply a human-centric test (which we don't even do by the way) to see if the species can be eaten. What do you expect the result would be? Even dolphins can fail this exam.<p>The bottom line is, your criteria is arbitrary and untestable.

Things like 'Company' are just not needed.<p>5. Phone verification is again something supported by very few banks.<p>That just cut down 7 fields with no compromise on fraud.<p>Also, any good payment processor will let you store card information (in a secure manner adhering to standards set by Visa, a.k.a being PCI complaint). So, you could just display the last four of the card along with card type and charge them at a later point of time (think Amazon checkout).<p>So, payment forms need not be nearly as bad as the one pointed out in OP.

If you're thinking of a low-volume, semi-manual system, you can simply generate a list of addresses, store them on a DB, and display them to customers for payment.  Then send out your product/service once you verify payment has cleared on the Blockchain Explorer.  That's a good, simple, low-tech way of taking care of things, as long as you carefully match addresses to customers and take care to securely store the wallet you used to generate the addresses.  But assuming you can program, it's not hard to implement an automated payment processor, or to integrate a third-party API.  Please don't be scared off by alarmists. As long as you are taking care not to store large sums of Bitcoins on your server, there's no problem.  You can easily set a cron job to move the full balance off your wallet every minute to a cold, air-gapped, inaccessible, off-site wallet (Armory looks good for storage).  As long as you're not <i>distributing</i> bitcoins (like exchanges have to do), you don't need to worry about keeping a large sum on the wallet you use for your app.  Please feel free to contact me at the address on my profile if you have any questions (my user name is my real name).",1362683589

Nonlinear systems are not difficult to control as a rule, with appropriate understanding of servomechanisms. To see how extraordinary such control can be, look at this video:<p><a href=""http://robohub.org/video-throwing-and-catching-an-inverted-pendulum-with-quadrocopters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robohub.org/video-throwing-and-catching-an-inverted-p...</a><p>> If society/economy/culture is a dynamical system that generates the power-law income distribution and this system cannot dissipate its ""energy"" and the exponent reaches some critical value then it will collapse or we'll have some kind of catastrophic phase transition.<p>These things happen, but usually because the system is not fully understood, or there's a reason it isn't being controlled, not because the system is innately uncontrollable. Obviously this moves away from technology and into philosophy, because the question becomes -- not whether the system can be controlled -- but whether such control is consistent with democratic principles.<p>> I don't think power-law distributions have 2 tails<p>Of course they do -- for example, any power law rule involving a power that's an even number:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/HU3KZQ7.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/HU3KZQ7.png</a><p>In fact, strictly speaking, all power law distributions have two tails, just not in the same direction:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/tcPYrJW.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/tcPYrJW.png</a>",1362683040

5339435,comment,5339052,5339052,9,0,tptacek,,,"<i>Don't compromise on price</i><p>Yes & no. Yes, if there's one thing you learn about pricing in consulting, it's ""never ever cut rate"" (you will never get a rate cut back). But the point in this article goes on to suggest that you should never back down from your assessment of what a project should cost, and that's going too far. Clients have budgets; sometimes those budgets are indeed too small for you to be productive, but other times they aren't and you should cut project scope to fit. Telling a client to spend more than they're comfortable spending is usually not a good strategy.<p><i>Don't do things for free.</i><p>No. When what a client needs is cheap and non-disruptive (and, one way to make it non-disruptive is to push the ""free"" back onto your schedule, which is coincidentally also a clean way to turn ""free"" into ""paid"" when the client balks at how long they'll have to wait), you should go ahead and do it to maintain the relationship. Doing favors for clients is, I promise you, cheaper than hiring salespeople. If you have a client that can't be trusted not to abuse favors, fire the client.<p>Lesson in human nature: there are few things you can do in a business relationship that are more offensive than charging for something that your counterparty doesn't expect to be charged for. So, one thing <i>never</i> to do: take an inbound request from a client, do the work with no contract, and then send an invoice.<p><i>Don't let clients pay you later</i><p>No, at least, not when you're working with companies of 100 or more people. You can negotiate payment terms, but you should learn how to sniff out payment processes that are nonnegotiable. Trying to convince a Fortune 500 company to pay you in installments or, worse, withholding work based on those installments is a recipe for disaster. It doesn't even help you; it just creates an opportunity for the client to continually second-guess whether they're getting value from the engagement. I expect 30 web developers to chime in here with client horror stories. My response to all of them will be the same: don't work as a web developer for small businesses. Also: some of your best clients will be the worst at handling payments. Build your business so that it can thrive even on slow payments.<p>Don't work for clients who can't be trusted to pay you. Real clients wouldn't dream of skipping out on a payment; what possible upside could there be to that? ""Woopity-doo, we saved $30,000 and trashed our reputation and I got fired! Look how smart I am!""<p><i>Don't be at their beck and call</i><p>Sounds good to me. Set clear expectations. If you answer your emails at 9:00PM, clients will expect you to keep doing that. The flip side of this is that clients are usually entitled to set the terms on which you communicate, and if the client wants 10:00AM meetings, be prepared to roll out of bed 3 hours early to get on the call.<p><i>Don't part take in useless meetings</i><p>You should stay out of internal meetings; you shouldn't be a part of the weekly staff all-hands. But be aware that some ""useless"" internal meetings are resolving communications problems between stakeholders in your project. <i>You</i> don't get value out of those meetings, but your clients get value out of having you there. When skip out of the meeting, you become a shadowy figure or a weird black box that people resent and blame for communications issues. You can blame the client for being irrational about this (and subsequently lose the client), or, just get on the phone for the meeting.<p><i>Don't write lengthy proposals</i><p>And lose engagements to the consultancies that will.<p><i>Don't wait until client asks for an update</i><p>Yep. Daily status mail. I wish I could make myself do this reliably, because it's helped every time I've done it.<p><i>Stop caring about only the money</i><p>I didn't understand this point.<p><i>Don't do everything clients asks</i><p>This strikes me as a dumb reason to get fired by a client.",1362682903

Last time I checked my hotel bill, the hotel wasn't sharing anything with me.  It was charging me a fee for a service.  If I rent my house out, I'm not sharing it with my tenant, even if I continue to live there.  I'm engaging in commerce.  Why does this change if I do it short term?<p>I'm curious - does anyone know how this term (sharing economy) was started?  It is no small rhetorical victory to get your commerce site referred to as a sharing site.  I recall a sarcastic comment on an earlier HN thread about airbnb: ""Unregulated sharing pisses me off. Let's put an end to this madness."".<p>While people generally (especially on HN) don't like onerous government regulations on commerce, I still don't think the statement would have had the same impact if you substituted ""commerce"" for ""sharing"".  Most people accept that the govt would place reasonable regulations on commerce (there is a commerce clause in the US constitution, but not so much on ""sharing"".  I understand that sharing has a broader vernacular use that may incorporate an exchange of money, but the associations people have with the words ""commerce"" and ""sharing"" are very different, and this doesn't seem like one of those ambiguous cases.",1362682850

Intuition teaches you nothing about the underlying processes.<p>If you come across a situation which doesn't behave intuitively, the human brain scrambles to find something - anything - that might come close to explaining how how it works, filling in the blanks as appropriate.

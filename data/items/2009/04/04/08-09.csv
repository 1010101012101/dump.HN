This is because .kr is a country code top-level domain and the registry for .kr domains is the National Internet Development Agency of Korea (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Internet_Development_Agency_of_Korea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Internet_Development_A...</a>).

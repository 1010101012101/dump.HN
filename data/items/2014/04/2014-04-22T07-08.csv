Whilst it&#x27;s a natural choice for portability, when you port to a proprietary platform such as windows you lose a lot of the support and portability guarantees that POSIX gives you and the calling conventions and standards of many libraries.

If this is a case of the workplace sociopath, I pity all involved. In my own experiences working with manipulative people, they typically find a narrative to support their abusive behaviors and when these people are called on for those actions, they either act surprised or hurt and often both. This person is hurt by being called things like &quot;naive&quot; because it is reflective of their own incompetence. Certainly &quot;optimistic&quot; is a better way of putting it because it means all of the\n&quot;good intentions&quot; were squandered by everyone else who just didn&#x27;t get it. The manipulator shouldn&#x27;t have to suffer the consequences, since it is his/her trust that has been betrayed. You see, all along, the manipulator was trying to be the good guy. The one making the office better, &quot;more fun&quot;, it was always good intentions but the other people either misunderstood or just want to spoil it for the rest of us.<p>I sincerely hope no one has to work with this personality type but I am willing to bet most everyone has seen this bad faith behavior in action. You know the office bully who, when called out for pushing a person around says in some form, &quot;come on, can&#x27;t you take a joke?&quot; Isn&#x27;t it odd how this same person never calls the thing a joke when he or she gets what is wanted out of the same behavior?<p>&quot;I was totally joking when I said I needed you to work over the weekend or else. Seesch. Lighten up.&quot; I can assure you, I have never heard of a single person getting a monday apology email for putting in that weekend work from this sort of office &quot;practical joker.&quot;<p>So it is not too surprising to see HR departments and lawyers finding themselves implementing &quot;PC&quot; policies and &quot;buzz kill&quot; practices as a means of mitigating these sorts of power abusive strategies since the bully is ultimately going to act the victim of misunderstood intentions when asked in any form to stop.<p>Isn&#x27;t it odd how the biggest tragedy for this personality type is having to admit how their actions might have hurt others?",1398152195

I&#x27;m actually quite surprised to see somebody who is so bold as to say a Windows user is a non-starter. I think this is very small minded, particularly as most end users are likely on a Windows PC, even if they have an iOS or Android mobile or tablet device. Developing for linux servers is a bit nicer on OSX, but if you&#x27;re more comfortable on Windows, and can make it work for you, than that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>As far as scripting languages go, I&#x27;ve got a bit of experience with Ruby and Python, as well as PHP, but I&#x27;d say  my go to language of choice is Javascript. Java is still a hugely popular language, and there are so many others.<p>Basically, I think this presenter is trying to give &#x27;start-up founders with little technical knowledge&#x27; the ability to screen technical people, but I think that is really difficult to do without knowing what type of technical position the person is hiring for.

Unfortunately, there are some primitives in Mesos that have been discussed for quite some time and have yet to be implemented that aim to alleviate the issues brought up the Omega paper. I think the Omega model makes sense at Google, where they have complete control over the schedulers. However, in the open source world, I think the Mesos model is more appropriate (this claim really warrants it&#x27;s own post). With additional primitives, like &quot;optimistic offers&quot;, &quot;revocable offers&quot;, and &quot;over-subscription&quot;, many of the issues discussed in the Omega paper should be remediated.<p>Dislaimer: I am a Mesos PMC member. :)",1398150738

The Working group is also called 6LoWPAN, IIRC.<p>The suite primarily provides a standardized packet format and addressing information. This is a good starting point - <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4944"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4944</a>. This is needed because Regular IPv6 packets are way too large for sensor network purposes. The standardization also allows these devices to interop with regular IPv6 gateways.<p>AFAIK work on all this started in TinyOS and they still maintain a solid implementation. TinyOS also works on extremely small devices and has a reasonably active community.<p>Also, from my understanding There&#x27;s nothing inherent to 6LoWpAN that allows sleep. It&#x27;s just that the protocol doesn&#x27;t really care about how nodes operate. Routing protocols are free to build on top of this packet format and work however.

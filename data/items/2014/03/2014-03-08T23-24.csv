Let&#x27;s use your dams example. They built a bunch of big dams in the 50s and 60s and each one had more than 10,000 people working on it. They were mostly publicly financed, so more or less not built to make money. They didn&#x27;t worry about adding a few more (or a few hundred more) people to the job because they were cheap. Now, the people that do this work are really expensive, and adding a few more means the people in charge make less money.

There&#x27;s a very solid case for integers in programming languages: <i>many</i> places in code call for a number which <i>must</i> be an integer: having the type enforce this is nice: you don&#x27;t need to check and abort (or floor, or whatever) if someone passes you a non-integer. Basically, anything that does an array index, which is any for loop walking through a memory buffer (which might be an array, a string, a file, the list goes on and on. Anything that can be counted) wants an integer. x[i] where i is not an integer just doesn&#x27;t make sense: ideally, let a type system enforce that.<p>Granted, of course, that many languages will just truncate a float in an integers context, and so funny stuff does happen (I don&#x27;t really feel that this is a good thing). (Although interestingly, JS is not one of them.) Personally, I think JS <i>needs</i> an integer type. Especially when you see people start getting into bignum stuff in JS, it gets silly fast, as first you can only store so many bits before floating point loses precision, but even then, even if you have an &quot;integer&quot;, JS will find funny ways to shoot you in the foot.

This is true for the Saturn V, for the World Trade Center, dams, highways, high speed rail, etc. It makes me wonder where these &quot;productivity improvements&quot; really are, especially the ones that computers presumably give us. Perhaps AutoCAD and MS Word and email make us <i>feel</i> more productive, but are actually slowing us down. Or perhaps all of it just increases the velocity of money through the economy, which particularly helps those whose income is proportional to transaction rate (banks, brokers, and governments).",1394320106

However given the size of modern floating point units I doubt it&#x27;s a massive overhead. Basically they would need to convert back and forth between the native zeros and ones of hardware and the decimal representation. And extra logic <i>might</i> mean slower hardware in certain circumstances.<p>Basically try to implement a BCD counter in verilog and you&#x27;ll see where the overhead appears compared to a &quot;dumb&quot; binary counter.<p>In practice it would be slow because not a whole lot of CPU architectures natively handle BCD. If this &quot;standard&quot; goes mainstream maybe the vendors will adapt and make special purpose &quot;DEC64 FPU&quot; hardware.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what&#x27;s the point of using this floating point format outside of banking and probably a few other niche applications.

244214,comment,243920,244118,0,0,lsc,,,"I think recognizing talent in the context of an interview is difficult, but not impossibly so.  I think judging how well they work, (do they 'get stuff done') is much more difficult during interviews, unless the person has solo projects.    I know working for others, I've recommended several 'smart but useless' people after interviewing.  Usually when hiring people I know, though, I know in what ways they are useless, and can hire for positions where I can make up for their weaknesses.<p>but I don't think it's difficult to judge a person if you have known them for a while, especially if you are the type to talk about technical things in social contexts.<p>I think the problem appears when you are judging things outside your field, or people you only see for an hour.",1215827225

How much does the company have to sell for you to see a windfall which is more than 1x your annual salary? a LOT. They basically have to public.<p>Being a second or third tier hire is a bad place to be. Not enough salary to make it worth it, not enough stock to have a windfall (unless you do ipo which isn't happening a lot right now), and huge hours as if you were a co-founder / first employee.",1215826237

Transmission costs are lower, so maybe that partially counters this.<p>2 - Electrication, if we relate it to a software design principle, is like loose coupling. You can change the underlying code as long as the output (interface) is electricity, the implementation details are hidden from the rest of the system.",1215825627

1971486,comment,1970193,1971071,0,0,patrickk,,,"Yeah the comparison between Jobs' veteran attitude and Zuckerberg's um, exuberance came across strongly reading this. The personal computing revolution was far more important, in my opinion; and if Jobs doesn't think that Apple technology isn't changing the world significantly then Facebook certainly won't. Slogans like ""This changes everything. Again"" for the iPhone 4 are just marketing spin.<p><i>""Zuckerberg was still on stage, an analyst leans over to me and says, “They just changed local commerce forever.” It wasn’t even lunchtime yet.""</i><p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. First, they haven't done anything yet. Not anything visible that I can see anyway. (The 'analyst' is speaking in the past tense.) Secondly, people like to read newspapers and magazines, watch tv then go browsing shops and buy stuff they may need or not based on ads they saw. Facebook or the internet does not enter the equation. The majority of people I know are like this to one degree or another. Amazon and eBay, two companies aimed squarely at bringing shopping online, haven't dampened people's affinity for buying stuff on the high street. And they've been around for years.<p><i>""What we’re imagining is very different,” says Chris Cox, who dropped out of Stanford to join the company in 2005 and is now one of Zuckerberg’s closest lieutenants. “If you imagine a television designed around social, you turn it on and it says, ‘Thirteen of your friends like Entourage. Press play. Your dad recorded 60 Minutes. Press play.’” In other words, the world will be experienced through the filter of one’s Facebook friends.""</i><p>This is also dead wrong. Most of the people I've friended on Facebook have much different tastes to me. The last thing I would want is to get recommendations based on what my 'friends' like. If you were talking to some random person at a party for five minutes it's almost becoming a faux pas not to friend them on Facebook. Do I really want to be spammed with updates about Glee or whatever?",1291550801

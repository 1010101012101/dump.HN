992750,comment,992154,992442,0,0,trebor,,,"Basically, ""the more the better"". In lieu of a summary, let me try to see if I understand it.<p>The deck is more random: the more times you shuffle, the more cuts you make, and the more you randomize the size of your cuts. To draw my own conclusion, the more chaos you throw into your method (which may even include lesser amounts of shuffling) the better the randomness of the deck should be.",1260715174

It means what people use it to mean, now. We probably need a new name for the logical fallacy, unless lumping it into circular reasoning is sufficient.",1260714553

992739,comment,992218,992678,0,0,camccann,,,"But it is <i>easier</i> when you're dealing with a ""pure"" function. In something like Haskell, a function that doesn't touch any of the stateful sequencing monads is guaranteed to neither alter <i>nor depend on</i> any sort of global state.<p>In my experience, the times that lack of path coverage gets you into the most trouble is when one large-ish function depends in subtle ways on global state, and inevitably there are bugs involving one or two global states that you don't catch in testing, and then you get errors out in production and have to figure out what on earth is causing it. Not fun.",1260713827

A type system guarantees that for all instances of the types, certain properties hold.<p>Given the choice, I know which I'd choose!<p>In practise it's not quite that simple, but designing around the types and shifting the burden of testing on to the compiler seems like the way forward.",1260713020

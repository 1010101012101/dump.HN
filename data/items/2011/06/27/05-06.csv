Or they attempt to do stock planning themselves, which is only ideal if you are already knowledgeable about the market and can invest time each day to study it.<p>The service could bridge the 'knowledge gap', allowing those who want to plan themselves to do so without pitfalls. And since its a system of sensible defaults as their knowledge of the market increases they can tweak the parameters of the program to better suit their needs. In a black box program such as a neural network on the algorithmic side, or a financial planner on the human side, this is impossible.",1309154372

Average net tuition and fees at public four-year colleges this past year were only about $2,000 (though Congress may soon cut federal financial aid). ""<p>And if you read the cited article it points out that over the five years from 2004 to 2009 (when the cited article was written), while the ""sticker price"" of college has gone up dramatically, the actual amount paid by students has actually declined (for tuition and fees):<p>""Yes. At public four-year colleges, the sticker price rose by 20 percent over the past five years (these are inflation-adjusted dollars, as are all historical comparisons Im making), but the average net price fell $400  from about $2,000 to $1,600. At private four-year colleges the sticker price rose by 15 percent, but the average net price fell 9 percent, or about $1,100.<p>It is important to note that these figures are just for tuition and fees. Students also have to live, eat, buy books, and cover other expenses while they are in school. """,1309154322

Working on a cluster invites an entirely different bundle of conceptual and practical hurdles (e.g. parallelism, working remotely, industrial-strength shell scripting &c.)  Even though I had been programming since I was a kid, I found my crash-course in HPC to be quite challenging; confronted with a new programming model in a new low-level language, it was the first time that I really appreciated what it must be like not to know how to program at all.<p>So: code as much as possible.  As soon as you can possibly stand it, look into MPI4py and start parallelizing your code.  Chances are you won't be working with python in HPC contexts, but learning parallel programming at the same time as C or fortran would be needlessly difficult.  I would also try to get time on a cluster as soon as you're in a position to use it respectably.  Most universities with HPC facilities have an online application for an account, and some sysadmin might take pity on you :)  Otherwise, maybe Amazon has some kind of deal?<p>In the interim, become _very_ comfortable with bash and general command line fu, and a serious text editor.

I'd argue that there were forces at work bigger than satisfaction with place.<p><i>added on edit</i>:<p><i>There's lots of smaller (single-center) towns with a nice downtown, and a crappy strip area elsewhere. In those towns everyone shops in the crappy strip, because they want a nice big grocery store with good prices, and you just don't get that with a local/small grocery store. And businesses that provide real value want to build new buildings, and it's damn hard to build the right building in built-up cores. Maybe resolvable, but it's hard, and regressing to older forms won't do it.</i><p>That's right, but not for the reason you state. They shop at the strip-mall because it's probably closer and more convenient to them. That's the issue. A focused, mixed use center is the ideal but it requires neighborhoods to be integrated into it. The problem with modern American planning has been a desire to strictly separate (usually by massive boulevards) uses from each other. Work pods, retail pods, and living pods are all kept strictly apart. That's when the strip mall becomes more convenient. It's easy to park and quick to get to.<p>However, when you look at cities that do this right (Portland is my go-to example always) then it's a very different picture. They are pushing the concept of ""20 minute neighborhoods"" with the idea that all of the citizens within Portland will have essential living resource (Grocery Stores and the like) within a 20 minute walk of their house. They are building sidewalks and working to re-engineer neighborhoods to nicely integrate these areas into the actual fabric of the neighborhood.<p>It's a bold plan, but it reflects what has been very successful in that city. There are neighborhoods in Portland where everyone DOES shop in the city center. Between effective transit and smart planning the relatively small city of Portland has built something really cool. They HAVE grocery stores (large format and with those reasonable prices you mention) within easy walking distance of many peoples homes. Those stores are heavily used.<p>I think the issue with urbanism is simply that most people don't have the option. It's something we've had to rediscover and recent trends have certainly shown a movement back towards stronger mixed-use neighborhoods in the last decade.",1309151265

Although there are ""workarounds"" around the problem, you'll find things much easier for development on an Ubuntu or Mac computer.<p>Now for a language recommendation. I am a Ruby programmer, so I've got a pretty heavy lean towards that.<p>Ruby is an exceptionally easy language to learn. There's a book called Learn to Program written by Chris Pine (<a href=""http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a>) which is an amazing beginning to getting into Ruby.<p>Past that, there's the Well-Grounded Rubyist by David A. Black (<a href=""http://manning.com/black2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manning.com/black2</a>) which covers all the things from basic Ruby up to medium-advanced levels of Ruby). There's also Programming Ruby 1.9 by the Pragmatic Programmers (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9</a>)<p>If you want to brush up your Ruby skills, the Ruby Koans (<a href=""http://rubykoans.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubykoans.com/</a>) are also pretty good.<p>If you're looking to get into web development (well, you ARE on the internet!) then I would recommend learning HTML and CSS with a book such as HTML 5 and CSS 3 by Brian Hogan (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3</a>). Then a good JavaScript book, perhaps something like JavaScript: The good parts (<a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748</a>).<p>After learning as much of those as you can, familarize yourself with Git by reading the Pro Git book by Scott Chacon (<a href=""http://progit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://progit.org/</a>), or if you choose another version control piece of software (Mercurial, Bazaar are good, SVN isn't and CVS is (I'm pretty sure) the work of demons).<p>Ah and before I forget, I've got The Developers Code (<a href=""http://www.thedeveloperscode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedeveloperscode.com/</a>) bookmarked for late-night reading and I'm quite enjoying it so far. Quite a lot of lessons in there that I have learned over my brief career, but ones I knew from the beginning.<p>One more final thing: you are new here and people will treat you like that. Be nice to them and they will be plenty nice back. Respect the fact that they have limited patience and may not wish to answer your questions eternally. They may also have other people asking them questions at the same time you are, or have other things they would like to be doing.<p>You will get better with practice. You show a keen want to learn, which is a great start. Never give it up. Nothing is ""too hard"" forever. Persist, and for the love of god, practice.",1309150971

2700184,comment,2699921,2699921,2,0,siculars,,,"I went to visit the Golden Gate Bridge[0] for the first time a year ago. Standing in Marin county, overlooking the Golden Gate, there is a nice little park with a number of plaques rattling off various tidbits of information. Two items struck me in particular. One, the Golden Gate took four years to complete. And the other, the Golden Gate was completed underbudget. Now, cast your gaze a touch behind and you see the utter failure of the new Bay Bridge. A bridge that is overdue and over budget - and made in China to boot. And this, my friends, is why America is going out of business. When we can not even manufacture the ingredients in our national infrastructure projects it is an absolute shame and travesty.<p>Here are some choice quotes from the article:<p><pre><code>  I dont think the U.S. fabrication industry could put a project like this together, Brian A. Petersen, project director for the American Bridge/Fluor Enterprises joint venture, said in a telephone interview. Most U.S. companies dont have these types of warehouses, equipment or the cash flow. The Chinese load the ships, and its their ships that deliver to our piers.\n</code></pre>\nAnd<p><pre><code>  ... they note that with the full financial force of the Chinese government behind its infrastructure companies, the monumental scale of the work, and the prices bid, are hard for private industry elsewhere to beat.\n\n</code></pre>\nBasically we can not even build these projects anymore. And why? Because the Chinese government, with the help of our enfeebled government, has eroded our capability to do so. The Chinese unfairly financially back bids for projects against private firms. Chinese firms get financing directly from the government at favorable rates that allow them to submit bids that private firms can not match.<p>I ask you this, if we had to win the next World War, where would the manufacturing for our Liberty Ships and B17's[2] come from? I, for one, do not welcome our Chinese overlords and hope we in America wise up before the final nail is in the coffin.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ships</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress</a>",1309150895

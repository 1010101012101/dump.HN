3007451,comment,3007047,3007047,6,0,timmy-turner,,,"RunSnakeRun is a nice tool to view the pstats data the python profiler generates. But for me, the squaremap is hard to read and does not really add any value. Also there is no way to 'watch' a pstats file, or combine many files into one. Generally I prefer working with the commandline, even for starting gui applications.<p>My current setup to profile a python cgi application consists of a set of scripts to mock the cgi runtime, invoke the application with cprofile and accumulate profiling data in a single pstats file. To get a grasp of the hot spots, I'm using the magnificent gprof2dot script (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot</a>) to generate a callgraph with profiling data (example: <a href=""http://wiki.jrfonseca.googlecode.com/git/gprof2dot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.jrfonseca.googlecode.com/git/gprof2dot.png</a>). Gprof2dot hides all unimportant (by default less than 1% runtime) calls and colors functions according to the time spend executing them.\nTo view absolute numbers, I wrote a small python script to print the first view entries of a pstats file to the terminal and use that with watch (<a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/1/watch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.die.net/man/1/watch</a>) to keep an eye on absolute runtimes.<p>Overall this is a nice setup and I'm very impressed by the rich amount tools available for python, though sometimes the APIs are kind of strange to me (for example cProfile, pstats).",1316242661

3007445,comment,3007160,3007333,6,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Auto racing used to be a lot more dangerous for spectators than it is today. We're only 30 years or so removed from a time when bails of hay and waist-high walls were all that separated crowds from the track. Go back a little bit further and you'd see things that would be laughably unsafe by today's standards like gigantic trees lining the sides of several race tracks.<p>I'm not even sure where you could begin improving safety for crowds at air racing events without forcing them to move much further back from the action.  With cars you can move back 50 feet, put up a barrier, and improve your safety tremendously. For planes, you'd probably have to move the crowds way further back than they are now. I imagine being up close and in front of the action is part of the spectacle though.<p>One unorthodox approach could be restricting these events to landscapes where the crowds could be on an elevation above the planes. I watched the video and in the background are hills/mountains where crowds could safely be located above the planes.",1316242502

As long as that's true they will have no wealth.  I know single people who make over six figures and have a negative net worth.  Saying xx% of people haven't saved any money is not the same thing as saying that same percentage of people <i>couldn't</i> save money.  They just didn't.  That's the point of the article, and no matter how trite it seems, it's true.<p>>The bottom 60% have actually lost, on the whole, from their additional striving. Their return on additional labor has been negative.<p>You have to pick your time frame very carefully for that to be true.  It's definitely the case the rich have been getting richer.  The poor have been getting richer as well:  <a href=""http://blogs.dailymail.com/donsurber/archives/42130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.dailymail.com/donsurber/archives/42130</a><p>Realize that the people in the bottom quartile are not the same people who were in the bottom quartile twenty years ago.  Between 1985 and 2010 we had over ten million people immigrate to this country with no ability to speak English and no marketable skills.  You can hardly blame the economy for not lifting them out of poverty yet.<p>>It's irrational, given that state of affairs, to strive.<p>Complete, unadulterated BS.  It's not irrational at all.  Even today, with the deleveraging that's going on, you can make a comfortable life for yourself if you're willing to ""strive"".<p>Or, I guess, you can stay at your mom's place, drink beer, and play video games.

You read a lot of articles decrying the state of programming for kids these days, but I think it's all nostalgia.  Programming is more accessible than ever.  The only problem is there's way more distraction now, but the number of young programmers seems to keep growing.",1316239573

If you want short hair, go over your head with the number 3 guard every month or so. If you want long hair, never cut your hair at all, and you look awesome after a couple years. I haven't had my hair cut in eight years. Women come up to me on the street and tell me they're jealous of my hair. It's not that hard.",1316239504

That economic growth has been to a great extent the result of the productivity gains of the other 95% working harder and longer and more efficiently (with better technology). The bottom 60% have actually lost, on the whole, from their additional striving. Their return on additional labor has been negative.<p>It's irrational, given that state of affairs, to strive. It's exactly akin to the arguments people raise when you talk about 90% marginal tax rates --- who would rationally work more when most of their gains go to the government? Well, who would rationally work more when most of the gains go to the rich? We keep people working more through cultural influence, but that doesn't make it rational.",1316239246

Why didn't you hire one for the day you cheapskate! Hahaha!"".<p>It's not the mention of money that matters, it's the automatic dismissal of your life situation as something that doesn't happen to real people - it isn't even a concept - to all the other people in the group, and how alienating that scenario is to be on the 'wrong' side of.

5427284,comment,5424241,5426704,9,0,tanzam75,,,"Actually, the war was every bit as intense in 1914 as it was in 1915-1918.  400,000 casualties at the Battle of the Frontiers.  250,000 casualties at the Battle of Tannenberg.  Half a million casualties at the First Battle of the Marne -- which included losing 20,000+ men in a single day.<p>Remember -- the war in 1914 was a war of movement.  Which meant that men were charging across open fields to attack the enemy.  The Germans wore leather helmets, the other armies wore cloth caps, and the French wore red trousers.  Yet the armies had modern rifles and artillery.  This was a deadly combination.<p>Battles in 1915-1918 racked up higher total casualties, largely because they lasted longer.  The Battle of the Somme lasted four <i>months</i> -- because they kept fighting over the same piece of land.  Whereas in early 1914, the armies were still fighting a war of movement, so they'd fight in ten different towns, and the casualties would be spread out over ten different battles.<p>The Christmas Truce was not a question of numbers -- for a <i>lot</i> of men had already been killed or wounded -- but attitudes.  The soldiers still felt that their opponents were fighting honorably.  Poison gas, the British starvation blockade of Germany, unrestricted submarine warfare -- that would all come later.",1364014249

It took a little while to understand what was going on but once I did, I set up a project template that I've been able to use in all projects with little in the way of changes. Dev with asynchronous loading and production with built file.<p>The best thing about it is I use jade for my template language and it can be configured to precompile the jade in the bill step, allowing me to use jade in the browser on older browsers. Also as mentioned in a sibling comment I use the same config file for building and development.<p>This isn't specific to requirejs but it was also possible to work it into the asset pipeline of my backend system so that in production it compiles, caches and serves the built file and in dev it uses the asynchronous loader.<p>The only issue I've run into is the same as the flotr2 issue described in the post, which it sounds like there is an easy fix for ski look forward to trying it out.",1364014015
5427276,comment,5426831,5427252,9,0,newnewnew,,,"There are people that have the ""I'm offended"" weapon and people that don't. As far as I can tell offending a woman or a non-Asian racial minority is considered to be a Very Bad Thing. It might even get you fired. And there are no rules. Every person is different and you don't know who you will offend and who you won't. Adria was spotted playing ""Cards Against Humanity"" at the conference and I would assume that I would be safe making almost any joke in conversation with someone that played CAH. But I would be wrong and she would kill my job with her special weapon.<p>There's good reason these groups have these weapons. They have historically gotten the shit end of the stick from everybody else and we are sensitive to any potential bias compensate for that. But with power comes responsibility and we can't go using our weapons unreasonably if we are all going to get along.<p>I don't mean to have a ""irrelevant racial tinge"" and you can correct me if you think I'm wrong, but my read is that white and Asian men don't have this weapon, unless they are disadvantaged in some other obvious way. For example, if a handicapped white man got offended at someone making some statement related to that handicapp it might be treated with the same gravity. But most don't have the weapon, so they are scared and confused and grope for understanding (like the OP).<p>I've never been to /r/MensRights. I guess I'm not supposed to say things like this.

5427271,comment,5420670,5422072,1,0,gizmo686,,,"Your explanation of 'true' QC seems misleading as well. We can (and have) constructed the quantum gates necessary to build a computer with the classical gate structure. It is true that in doing so, if we make the input a superposition of states, then the output will be a superposition of the states that would result from passing in each individual state into a classical computer. However, this is not sufficient for us to actually take advantage of the massive parralelization. \nLets assume you have a N quibit input, which is a perfect superposition of all 2^N possible states, and as many internal quibits as you want. You have some boolean function, f(n), that is true for exactly 1 number (and that number fits in N bits). If you tried applying programming your QC to apply f(n) to the superposition, then after you do that, you will have a superposistion of 2^N-1 0s, and one 1, all with an equal probability. When you go to measure it, you will read either 0, or 1. Not very usefull.<p>You can fix this problem using N+1 quibits, and returning the input number along with the answer. Now, you have 1 state where the 'answer' quibit is true. When you go to measure the system, you have a 1/(2^N-1) probability of seeing that state. If you see another state, then you have collapsed the superposition and need to redo the computation. This is equivalent to just randomly picking an input in the first place. \nQuantom mechanics does not allow a way of taking a system and making one state more probable based on its value (IE. guaranteeing that the one you measure is the one marked 'true'). However, their are some quantum mechanical mechanisms that can provide provable improvement.<p>One such algorithm is Shors, which allows efficient factorization of prime numbers.<p>In my opinion, their is a far more interesting result I have seen, which is a general algorithm that can take any problem with a solution space of 2^N, and solve it in 2^(N/2).<p>Sadly, it has been a while since I dabbled in quantom computing so I do not recall the details of that, and I very well might have gotten stuff wrong to.<p>I am however becoming convinced that P/=NP is a physical law of the universe.<p>EDIT: I just read farther down the thread. I think the algorithm I was referring to is Grovers search algorithm which was mentioned by zaptheimpaler.",1364013929

I grew up in the same era as you did, and I'm guessing you just had the misfortune of not being asked to walk in another person's shoes. You go ahead and enjoy all that delicious privilege.<p><i>> I don't see how calling languages ""estrogen"" is offensive</i><p>When I first read this in the article, I cringed. Then, when he further tried to 'explain himself' with, ""I was mostly making a joke about how seriously C++ programmers take themselves compared to Java programmers,"" I cringed even harder. IT'S OFFENSIVE TO SAY THAT ONLY MEN TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY IN PROGRAMMING. It boils down to men = serious and women = emotional, flippant, hysterical, etc. It's a horrible horrible analogy and quite frankly I'm surprised that didn't blow up in his face even more than it did.<p><i>> I don't understand how calling a hat ""cute"" is offensive.</i><p>Again, ignorance. Would you tell a male admiral that his hat was ""cute""?

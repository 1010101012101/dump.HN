8350800,story,,,1,0,lgp171188,"Ask HN: Handling a dispute on Elance with an unrelenting client",,"I was awarded a job to work on Elance that involved Django. I gave an estimate of the cost & schedule of 24 days and started working on the project immediately based on a word document that had specifications. Looks like the guy who awarded me the job was a recruiting agency guy who did it for his client.<p>Within a couple of days of starting work, I was told that the project deadline will be 11 days which was a significant reduction. So I asked for more money to complete more work in less time and delivered code for the first 3 milestones and asked for the client to verify the code and release payment for the same. The client did release the payment for the milestones and I started working on milestone 4 when I found out that my work is dependent on the work of another freelancer who was also contracted to work on the same project. The rate of discussing with the project lead and completing work was dismally slow and I was down with fever for 4 days while working on the project. And when I wanted to stop working on the project, I requested the same and was persuaded to go further. More details were added to the work and involved a lot of UI and jQuery stuff which I had 0 expertise. So I asked out and there was no response except that I had to complete the project. So I cancelled the job and they asked their money back. Initially I refused saying that it was for the code already delivered, but they were yammering on and on about how my code is useless to them unless I finish the project. Fed up with it, I offered to do full refund provided they sign an NDA that they will not use my code in any project and provide me a receipt for the payment.<p>But the guy went and raised a dispute on Elance, wants my account suspended alongwith the refund without providing NDA. Now it is in the Elance mediation stage. How should I handle this? I have proof on the workroom for code submission and that he has released payment after verifying the milestone.",1411397950
8350799,comment,8348883,8349327,9,0,giggitytex,,,"I am totally with you.  I must admit that at first I was taking ecstasy (MDMA) in a club setting.  Yes, it was a ball.  It opened me to the idea of talking to the opposite sex and not expecting them to roll their eyes and walk away.<p>After a while I began taking it at home and listening to music that inspired me.  I began to reflect on my childhood when I had 2 verbally abusive parents.  I had shut those thoughts out, and at 25 began dealing with them and seeing the effect their abuse had on me.  MDMA allowed me to look at those relationships in a completely loving light and realize them for what they were; 2 people who could not express themselves appropriately.  It changed my love for them in a very positive way, even after &quot;the roll&quot; had stopped.  I forgave them for the many years of anguish I experienced in middle school, high school and college.  I had literally ignored them since college out of anger for a lost childhood.  Being able to love them again made me realize that I can love others too.  Around that time is when I began to trust people and it is when I met my future spouse.<p>It&#x27;s a tough thing to admit, but MDMA had better reparation on my emotional and psychological state than many years of church and reading books.  I love God, I know he&#x27;s guiding us, and I think sometimes healing power starts on the inside of your mind.  If you&#x27;re a religious person, the first two commandments are &quot;Love God&quot;, and &quot;Love your neighbor&quot;.  MDMA helped me on both of those.<p>I just read a statistic the other day that veteran suicide rates are increasing.  As a non-combat veteran, I wish I could take the many troubled and PTSD afflicted and have them try MDMA to work through their issues in a controlled therapy session.",1411397942

Maybe get that checked?<p>For what it’s worth, my 5s gets about six hours of intense use. 50% brightness, Twitter, Safari, RSS reader, mix of WiFi and cell towers, mostly good reception. Five hours with only cell towers, average to good reception.<p>However, since the iPhones have such tiny batteries their battery use is also highly dependent on how you use your device. With something downloading (especially over LTE) I can practically see my battery draining and it gets quite hot.<p>Bigger devices with much larger batteries are a bit more sedate in their reactiveness to that, e.g. my iPad is much more constant in its battery usage. No matter what I do, it always gets nearly the same battery time. (Maybe because battery usage is much more dominated by the screen which has a constant battery use, so the other two big battery consuming components which are variable, radios and SoC, have a smaller difference in impact between being nearly idle and running at full tilt.)",1411397800

One of the easiest places to start is with representing HTML this way; you can e.g. start to write the Python or JS code:<p><pre><code>    [&quot;table&quot;, [&quot;tbody&quot;, [&quot;tr&quot;, [&quot;td class=first&quot;, 1], [&quot;td&quot;, 2]]]]\n</code></pre>\ninstead of:<p><pre><code>    <table><tbody><tr><td class=&quot;first&quot;>1</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</code></pre>\nA really early attempt at this is: <a href=""https://github.com/drostie/d.o/blob/master/build.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drostie/d.o/blob/master/build.js</a> but I haven&#x27;t maintained it in a while.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in language design, there appears to be a &quot;little gap&quot; which means a lot between a Lisp data structure and an XML data structure: In XML&#x27;s view, every list&#x27;s first element is a string; in Lisp&#x27;s, it can be anything. This little gap actually corresponds to one of the interesting habits which has disappeared since compilers took over our assembly-writing: it used to be the case that programmers would sometimes <i>compute an instruction code</i> for the next instruction; similarly in Lisps you sometimes (but not too often; it&#x27;s confusing!) compute a function for your next operation.<p>If that confuses you because you&#x27;re not good with Lisp, it&#x27;s equivalent in Python or JS is:<p><pre><code>     (f(x, y, z))(a, b, c)\n</code></pre>\nso that you figure out which function to call and then immediately call it on some parameters. It&#x27;s not necessarily a difference in expressiveness, as the XML-style just can add an atom &#x27;call&#x27; which expresses the above as:<p><pre><code>    call(f(x y z) a b c)\n</code></pre>\nbut it does seem to correspond to some deeply different philosophy for the system.",1411397519

8350755,comment,8349579,8349579,3,0,protonfish,,,"I think the desire to make games &quot;open-ended&quot; is inherently flawed (if you also want players to enjoy themselves.) The more complex and unpredictable a game becomes, the more difficult it is to balance. A certain (probably small) number of paths will be gravitated to leaving most stories unexplored and ending up equivalent to a linear story line (with a lot more work.) One way to attempt to fix this is to create multiple balanced paths (essentially a &quot;choose your own adventure.&quot;) This can be brute-forced by adding more and more optional story lines, but in the end it is just many linear stories which is functional equivalent to selecting from different games to play.<p>It is fun to think about creating a virtual world that is as rich and complex as the real one, but we already live in a reality that often sucks so hard we want to retreat into fiction.

If digital information stored on a phone is evidence covered by the 4th amendment[1], then the court can compel a person to provide it, including compelling them to use their passcode.<p>Kerr&#x27;s argument in his first post was that high-profile efforts to actively resist such warrants might lead the courts or Congress to &quot;up the ante&quot; by increasing the possible punishments. For example, imagine if Congress passed a law that failure to enter your passcode in a federal case results in a mandatory 10 year federal sentence (my invented example, not Kerr&#x27;s).

Here&#x27;s a list of reasons why that is wrong.<p>One, Cisco has 101 billion in assets, 48 billion in revenue, 70,000 employees, and acquired over 160 companies. They could pay an engineer whatever the hell the engineer wanted if they wanted to keep &#x27;em.<p>Two, Cisco&#x27;s products often include cutting edge or industry leading technology and innovations, partly due to the sheer size and scope of the products and markets serviced under its umbrella. If you want interesting work, it&#x27;s somewhere in the org, or will be on the next acquisition.<p>Three, they already do have top talent. See previously mentioned number of employees and companies.<p>Four, they don&#x27;t even need talented engineers to create products that will sell. Even college kids with no industry experience can create a successful product if they&#x27;re determined enough. Their well-oiled machine can deal with not having &#x27;rock stars&#x27;.<p>Five, great engineers work at all sorts of places for all sorts of reasons. You might find amazing work or you might find boring work. But if you want to become rich quick, everyone knows becoming a founder is the quickest way there. If you&#x27;re not a founder, you&#x27;re not going to get rich quick. So the math on that one is easy, for people who care about money over all.<p>Six, as for &#x27;why they do this&#x27;, my personal theory is they only do this when there isn&#x27;t a product they already own in a given market and they can&#x27;t find one to buy.<p>Seven, a lot of people seem to think that creating a successful product requires home-grown innovation. It doesn&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t need to personally have the best engineers, you just need to be able to license their tech. Many companies (even startups) do this.",1411396388

Some say a substantial fraction of the population is mildly hypothroid and meds are appropriate, cf. Broda Barnes.<p>Ari Whitten&#x27;s &quot;Forever Fat Loss&quot; I think covers all the causes of obesity and debunks the major myths. There is no simple solution because the totality of modern industrialized life conspires to produce obesity. Emotional stress, lack of sleep, lack of daylight exposure, micro-nutrient deficiencies, pollution exposure, and so forth all tank metabolism. The body is made for near continuous low level outdoor activity and &quot;working out&quot; is not a proper substitute. You&#x27;re designed to burn through large amounts of calories daily doing stuff like walking 8 miles at a leisurely pace and moving things around. Whereas the stress of a daily running habit is apt to adaptively lower the resting metabolic rate to the point it&#x27;s barely useful.<p>Everybody unduly obsesses over the food aspects, but to the extent there is a particular food villain it&#x27;s probably seed oils. Soy oil and canola oil suppress metabolism (directly interfere with mitochondria) and are quite new inventions, and are now consumed in huge quantities. Aside from that there is simple calorie over consumption driven by food reward. People are naturally attuned to much more monotonous and lower flavor diets than are readily available now.",1411396257

This is why modern games use Elo or TrueSkill to track each player&#x27;s performance, just as in chess. Chess too has a huge skill gap: an average player has no chance against a top player, but using Elo even games can be played.<p>I disagree that RTS is like Rock Paper Scissors. Starcraft maybe, but a well designed modern game no. In Rock Paper Scissors any person can have a roughly 50% win rate against any other person. The fact that an average player cannot win against a good player with any rush strategy indicates that it&#x27;s not Rock Paper Scissors.<p>The same goes for the start of a game. A good modern RTS does not require a standard 5 minute opening.<p>> It&#x27;s not the pinnacle of gaming<p>Oh, certainly. RTSes usually do very poorly on some other points (e.g. storytelling), and aren&#x27;t the best even on points that they score well on (e.g. chess involves far more decision making).

Game studios trip all over themselves to excitedly tell us about how their new technology will allow them Hollywood-like cinematic camera angles (see: Mass Effect), movie-quality camera effects. Hell, a lot of games even letterbox the screen to give it a more film-like quality.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to take storytelling expertise and technique from cinema, it&#x27;s another to clone it obsessively and completely fail to develop your own storytelling medium. Imagine if movies were invented only for &quot;filmmakers&quot; to simply film a book from top-down and a hand turning the pages!<p>One game I&#x27;ve been enjoying is Kentucky Route Zero - the story I find is fairly normal, but the way it&#x27;s presented takes pretty clear inspiration from traditional stage plays.

Perhaps by the time my 2-year-old is ~13, a nano-scale machinebook will exist that can teach the both of us about zero-knowledge protocols. I understand, at the surface level, how it works, but am far too dense to see how such a system could exist in, say, computer authentication.",1411394611

Prices are crazy high by default, but insurance companies are able to negotiate lower prices from providers. This means the uninsured are billed higher by default. It turns out that individuals can negotiate lower prices too - sometimes. I advocate that a given service provider should be forced to charge the same price for the same service to all patients. This might result in competition and lower prices, but in the mean time it should lower costs for the uninsured.",1411394592

There are also associated processes for executing that agreement.<p>How does that differ from, say, the person who &quot;knows heaps about the web and will build you a website&quot;? Well, their agreement (and processes, usually) aren&#x27;t as well defined.<p>My point is that those financial/insurance companies are really service businesses, it&#x27;s just that their services are so well defined they behave like products, and that you can do it too.",1411394559

Until it all gets balanced into a vanilla mush of nothingness. With the added bonus of the occasional unintended broken mechanic, tower rushes, marine rushes, zerg rushes. Anything called &quot;rush&quot; is usually an exploit of poorly thought out mechanic and an all or nothing of wasting 2 peoples time for ten minutes after which one or the other simply quits depending on whether the rush was spotted or not.<p>Most RTS games also seem to suffer from the same &quot;let&#x27;s play for 5 minutes of building and capturing exactly the same things every single game before the match actually starts&quot;<p>I myself do love these games, but I have friends who hate them.

I'm sure they've explored a more robust option, but it's probably nowhere near as cheap as the current model.<p>Maybe a paid upgrade card reader is the next step, but if their goal is broad, cheap and easy distribution they'll probably be shipping with this model for a long time.",1330930768

I think the term start-up should apply to high growth technology companies in the initial stages of their hockey stick curve (or which ever growth curve applies). Judging Foursquare on that basis, and assuming they can be as big as Twitter, they could  still grow by about 15x, so indeed they might be in the early stages of their growth and could be considered a start-up.<p>However, valid criteria for classifying a company as a start-up might include: rounds of funding (# or type), number of employees, relative maturity (compared to industry peers), market share, culture or maturity of the firm's core technology.<p>It is indeed quite messy and hard to classify a company as a ""start-up"".",1330930707

3665614,comment,3663854,3665558,2,0,stickfigure,,,"Right.  The benefits outweigh the disadvantages for you...  until they don't.<p>Nearly a decade ago I worked on MMORPGs for EA.  An astounding amount of game design, engineering, and customer support effort went into addressing a tiny portion of the userbase we called ""griefers"".  Griefers may be 0.1% of the population but one griefer can create an enormous number of unhappy players.  You come up with a feature and think ""there's only a tiny chance that someone could use this to harass or annoy another player""... and guess what, the actual chance is near 100%.  Maybe this is what bored kids do today instead of TPing houses.<p>The problem with simple one-click unsubscribe links is that there isn't a way to stop the griefing.  One kid gets the link and never tires of clicking it.  The owner has no idea who is doing it and can't stop it and gets incredibly frustrated and angry.  One incredibly angry user is far more hazardous to your business than 10,000 slightly inconvenienced users.<p>Is this a realistic problem?  I don't really know, it probably depends on your app.  The stakes are a lot lower here than in an MMORPG somebody is paying $20/mo for.  But when I look at the incentives, I genuinely wonder if one-click unsubscribe (or any other kind of auto-login from an email) is a good business decision.  It would certainly make sense to build in some protection, like expiring after 24 hours or whatnot.<p>I'm very curious to know what other people on the <i>sending</i> side of this business think.  Obviously as an email recipient you want the system to securely and anonymously read your mind and act according to your specific intention automatically all the time.",1330927464

(Which can be outputted to HTML, XML, DVI, etc, but is not itself a widely used text format.) After all, it was designed for a broken reader. And if you design something for something that's already ill designed, the end result is usually something as bad as or worse than the original article.<p>You also mentioned search. The thing about search is that even if the bash documentation was split into multiple parts, it's still a text file. So you could have your hypothetical man+ reader do something like:<p><pre><code>  cat /wherever/your/docs_are_stored/* | grep '-A 100' '-e search_term'\n</code></pre>\nAnd then let you go through the matches to find what you want.",1330927408

The San Francisco requirement was against my ideals that tech exists everywhere, and that&#x27;s not how I wanted to build a company.<p>So you have to be in the Bay Area for 3 months. After that you are welcome to be anywhere. If being in the Bay for the 3 months is not feasible, then just say so, or find something near you instead.<p>> More so, the stake they required relative to funding was pretty huge.<p>This is entirely dependent on what you currently have and what you hope to get out of YC. If you&#x27;re just starting out, that 10% stake is worth approximately $0, so it&#x27;s a good deal. If you&#x27;re doing $5mm in EBITDA a year, then it&#x27;s not. But to say that it&#x27;s &quot;pretty huge&quot; without any context is shortsighted.",1428771596

   small, highly decoupled and focus on doing a small task.

What Amiga really needed in their 1987 high-end product was a 14MHz 68020 (or EC020) based, 32-bit system, with a graphics chipset to match. Take the old chipset, but give it 2x the clock and 2x the memory bandwidth, and all sorts of things (including non-interlaced 8-bit 640x400 video) become possible.<p>If they had started working on this in late 1985, I think they would have had a chance at being taken more seriously. Instead, they didn&#x27;t even start revising the chipset until 1988, and they didn&#x27;t have a native 32-bit based system until the 3000 in 1990 (and even then, still with the old chipset).<p>In fairness, I understand the US-based side of Commodore was thinking along these lines for the 2000, but lost out to the Commodore German division&#x27;s model of a cheaper 1000 with slots and a better case.<p>What Apple proved was that an alternative to the PC was possible, if you were clever enough in your technology and your marketing.

9359837,comment,9359400,9359400,0,0,acscott,,,"Just feedback if you want to improve the discussion.<p>1) The example rows use first name and last initial for Client primary key attribute (e.g James H.).  No one uses this in the real world for a name-based primary key.  In fact, in a sufficiently large enough system, you would _never_ use a name for a primary key since names are not guaranteed to be unique.<p>2) Functional dependencies are interesting ideas.  The discussion says that studID (student id) determines address.  It would be beneficial to further discuss how we know that.  For instance, more than one student could live at the same address.  And a student could live at more than one address.  So does studID truly determine address?  Does the dependent attribute have to be unique?  Does the determinant set?<p>3) The discussion moves from Data(studID, studName, ...) to breaking it out to three entities and says &quot;The following structure is considerably better.&quot;  But what criteria make it better?<p>4) It states that &quot;Each student has his own address&quot;, but in the real-world that&#x27;s not _always_ true.  There will be cases when a student does not have an address, or the address is still unknown.  Also, mailing address and physical addresses can be two different attributes.  I&#x27;m being picky, right?  But these things come up all of the time (so much so it gives me heartburn).  So using good examples will help prevent future bad designs I believe.<p>5) courseID is supposedly functionally dependent on courseName.  Again, courseNames can be non-unique in a real school.  And courseID domain and range would be important to know whether courseID is unique.  For instance there are many 101 courses out there.  So is this a sequentially generated ID, a GUID?  Only then can we know if it&#x27;s truly unique.<p>6) Now to the really good stuff.  Functional dependencies are abstractions that exist outside of the database logical and physical design and implementation correct?  What if we identified all of the functional dependencies in our entities?  Could we generate a good table design automatically from that?  How do we prevent from modeling the entire universe and how do we prove that we&#x27;ve over-modeled? (I think one of the stated benefits of relation models is that once, you get to 3NF you can expand the model as needed.  So how do we use FDs to determine whether we are 3NF)?<p>Interesting reduction of FDs to mathematical concepts, but to make it useful to a practitioner, more to go.",1428770783

Still find iPhone tighter.<p>Development is not the pain/mess it is on Android. (See Android NDK for real pain.) However, Microsoft makes it arbitrarily painful to develop because they still refuse to support/conform APIs and protocols found on _every_ other platform from desktop to mobile, such as OpenGL (ANGLE doesn&#x27;t count) and OpenAL for games, to Zeroconf (aka Bonjour on Apple platforms, but compatible implementations are found everywhere but from Microsoft and WinRT). Their C compiler still officially hasn&#x27;t moved beyond C89 which is 2 standards out of date and particularly important for a lot of cross-platform open source native projects. (They&#x27;ve recently fixed it so they can at least compile Git, but refuse to make an honest attempt to make their compiler compliant to C99/C11.) And they arbitrarily broke compatibility with a lot of their Windows APIs making sure they alienate both developers from other platforms as well as those already in the Windows ecosystem.<p>Recent market analysis shows their marketshare is shrinking...around 2% worldwide.

Basically you are hoping to reach an equilibrium situation in which 0% of the allocated memory in nursery are true survivors. Because if the true survival rate was higher than 0%, then the larger the nursery size the longer the duration between collections and the higher the number of objects that are true survivors.<p>If you had a perfect situation like that, with a giant nursery, you wouldn&#x27;t even need to gc anything. When the nursery is full, just start over from address 0 and you can be confident that when the new objects starts overwriting the old that the old will already be unreachable from the object graph.<p>You never reach that situation in reality. Even in a simple web server some request handling thread might do something innocuous like setting a key in a cache hash somewhere leading to the hash being full and needing to be reallocated. That would dirty mark one card. And again, the longer the duration, the more of these &quot;freak&quot; events you get. Or there may be a string somewhere that keeps track of the current date and when it ticks over from &quot;July 31st, 2015&quot; to &quot;August 1st, 2015&quot; it triggers a reallocation because the last string is one character longer.<p>It may be that having a large nursery is a good <i>trade-off</i> because for many loads it&#x27;s the same cards being marked over and over again. That may outweigh the increased frequency of tenured generation collections (memory isn&#x27;t free so you must take the space from somewhere).",1428770317

All are poor, partial solutions. Yuck.<p>To fill the void, there has been a proliferation of application containers, each of which does a different 70% of the general problem. All of this stuff could just be done in the platform. And that&#x27;s what systemd is.<p>There&#x27;s going to be two separate camps at the end of this: a group led by the BSD platforms will stick to convenitional unix goals. On the other side, the linux kernel plays second-fiddle to systemd. The systemd service graph is a new operating system tradition.<p>[New, but not without precedent: in the debian world, the &#x27;apt&#x27; package management system has become more significant than the kernel. You can create things that are not linux, but which are still debian.

Feels like a business model that privileges their needs over their customer&#x27;s experience. And as a result, I opine that it is not likely to meet their expectations. I&#x27;d rather see an attempt to broaden the subscription base by aggressively lowering the cost ($7.99) and aggressively expanding the entitlement (sub includes crossword, for example).",1428768166

But the problem is that you can&#x27;t confirm the degree to which you&#x27;ve opened your eyes. How do you verify whether you know or really do not know a given thing? How do you see and verify the precision of your eyesight?<p>The thing is that someone&#x27;s &#x27;eyesight&#x27; (of their individual consciousness) is a function of their own individual degree of truthfulness. I hope that&#x27;s understandable. In other words, how much and how precisely we can see the world is determined by how truthful we are individually. Degree of truthfulness can be defined as the degree of exactness of confirmation. For example, I might have 65% truthfulness and therefore 35% untruthfulness. But we can&#x27;t tell how truthful we really are - we don&#x27;t know how precisely and how closely we are able to confirm things. That&#x27;s why even if we make a confirmation about something, we can&#x27;t just believe our confirmation, and we have to keep checking. Through this process we can improve our own individual wisdom. And it&#x27;s through wisdom that you can find the way to whatever abilities you want to have for yourself. All the ways exist in the world. It&#x27;s a question of recognizing what way has the result you want and then you need the willpower to correctly practice the correct way.<p>There are many enlightenments along the way to obtaining the supreme, perfect, final enlightenment. However it&#x27;s only a totally enlightened master, i.e. the one who has opened his/her eyes completely to the world, who can tell how truthful we really are.<p>If you really think you&#x27;ve obtained an enlightenment, I&#x27;d like to confirm it. You can either tell me what you can see, and then we can check it through proof, or as an alternative I can also ask you some questions about very simple terms that we learn at a young age and check through your answer what you can see.",1428768140

I have a great team n awesome prototype but Since I really follow what YC start up school teaches about start ups,They had a reason of Not inviting us for the next batch ,this has made us go back to the drawing board and rethink what we haven&#x27;t got right yet..infact we have started seeing flaws in our prototype that we didn&#x27;t see before 
If a team was invited from Africa ,that is great and it was my dream to have at least an African team in YC.Thanks you guys for the great efforts you are making to see start ups through the emotional roller coaster.",1428768135

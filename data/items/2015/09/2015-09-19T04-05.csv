They are non-existent in Australia.<p>It&#x27;s been amusing watching the resistance of North Americas to roundabouts, I think, because they are never taught how to use them.

In another city in North America I lived in, they put one in, and a lady promptly drove straight through it, crashing her car. She sued the city and one, because it wasn&#x27;t fair to go and put in a roundabout like that.",1442638433

There&#x27;s no boundless recursivity -- you stop at a point wherein you define your utility function.<p>What I mean by the utility function being arbitrary is there is no way to derive it from within utility theory, or within mathematics for that matter. In this sense the laws of physics are arbitrary; what you define as good principles of utility are also arbitrary, but that doesn&#x27;t make them useless -- in fact the stochastic version of the theory is widely applied in decision making and artificial intelligence. It let&#x27;s you scrutinize the basic principles and act consistently based on that. Not unlike other mathematical tools, it&#x27;s a way to find the best course of action given a small set of assumptions, and not more than that (i.e. doesn&#x27;t provide a way to find the assumptions, because it&#x27;s impossible).<p>Ultimately we&#x27;re just certain animals of a species, and things like happiness, ethics, morality, are the outcome of our traits and can&#x27;t be defined in a vacuum.<p>As noted, there&#x27;s also the equality interesting <i>reverse utility theory</i> --  that is, finding utility functions that approximately match our choices.

If anything, that&#x27;s still the case even today. Try to google on some technical topics like Ohm&#x27;s law or something and you&#x27;ll find very old websites built with good ole&#x27; HTML tables providing the information you need crisp and clear.<p>>Actually, I disagree. This is 2015. If I want to start a website on a certain topic, say about cars or electronics, I can find some really good free hosts who will support me without any sneazy catches. As a real example, I go to blogger.com, setup a new blog with my own custom theme, (with all the attribution to blogger removed if I want to) and start producing content. Not cool with blogspot? Then, how about Github pages? Not so technical? How about using a free shared web host (there are plenty, Google them)?<p>>If your objective is to spread information and knowledge, you will do that no matter what. It is when your objective is guised as spreading information when you really want to make money and scale up doing so, then you run into a problem. The problem with this kind of appeal against ad-blocking is the same old argument of &quot;How much is too much?&quot;
&quot;We need money to support our website to keep it up and running&quot;. But, never do these authors disclose how much they really need as long as they&#x27;re making a killer profit.
The problem with mixing ads with content is that introduces a conflict of interest - Are you writing that content because you like writing, or are you writing that content to get more eyeballs to serve your advertisers? And it&#x27;s very hard to convince your readers that you don&#x27;t intend to make money from them although you have ads on your site.<p>>For your reference, I do own a blog myself without any ads whatsoever and I think this is the future we&#x27;re heading towards. I am a proud user of adblock software and I refused to be shamed for that. As would any user, I am concerned about the content first, which is the logical reason why I go to a site. But, if the site tries hard to ruin my experience to make it difficult for me to consume that content, then of course, I&#x27;ll find a way to circumvent it. But, that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t support the authors of the site, just that as everyone else, I have my own way of supporting them. Just like how I&#x27;ve been donating to Wikipedia all these years.
There have been too many sites abusing the slogan of &quot;We need to place ads so we can support ads&quot; to buy back our lost trust. Sure, there will be a lot of content weeded out because they can&#x27;t support themselves, but I am confident that the ones whose objectives are to spread information will do so no matter what.<p>>We built the internet ourselves when no one gave us ads to support our efforts back then. And we&#x27;ll find a way to do it again. Just takes time and patience.",1442635528

I've had numerous leads, and was even supposed to start work on Monday on a project where I was the most experienced front-end developer, yet the client asked to have me removed from the project solely because they only wanted full-time hackers.

This was the second time this has happened in this week. I'm asking this because this isn't the first time a job has fallen through solely on the fact that I'm not full time.<p>What's up with this?

4060235,comment,4059188,4059894,4,0,kaib,,,"This is incorrect for a few reasons.<p>1. Limitations on geometry. CNC milling has a much smaller set of allowed geometry than 3D printing. More crucially, the limitations of 3D printing are closer to the limitations of what a stable physical object has (no things hanging in the air). As an example, sharp inner corner are impossible to do on a CNC mill, interior details inside cavities that are smaller than the toolhead are impossible etc.<p>2. Tooling cost. A lot of the cost of CNC milling comes from the tooling cost, basically the work and expertise required to set up a milling operation is considerable. Many times the setup causes the original design to change in subtle and unexpected ways (how do you hold the part between milling passes?). 3D printing has no such issues, if the geometry is valid it is as easy to print as any other valid geometry.<p>3. CAD software. Because of 1 and 2 it's much easier to make a CAD software that targets 3D printing exclusively. There is an emerging ""hobby CAD"" category aimed at all the new users having access to 3D printing. This is a meta observation that ""I drew in my CAD program"" is often the hardest problem to solve.<p>Here is a simple example. This was designed in roughly 30 minutes and printed out in various materials by clicking a UI button. I would be hard pressed to CNC mill this part even if I could change features like the eye sockets and mouth internal:

Running a successful pizzeria is more about schlepping to local hotels and leaving them 50 copies of your menu to put at the front desk, hiring drivers who will both deliver pizzas in a timely fashion and not embezzle your (razor-thin) profits while also costing next-to-nothing to employ, maintaining a kitchen in sufficient order to pass your local health inspector's annual visit (and dealing with 47 different pieces of paper related to that), being able to juggle priorities like ""Do I take out a bank loan to build a new brick-oven, which will make the pizza taste better, in the knowledge that this will commit $3,000 of my cash flow every month for the next 3 years, or do I hire an extra cook?"", sourcing ingredients such that they're available in quantity and quality every day for a fairly consistent price, setting prices such that they're locally competitive for your chosen clientele but generate a healthy gross margin for the business, understanding why a healthy gross margin really doesn't imply a healthy net margin and that the rent still needs to get paid, keeping good-enough records such that you know whether your business is dying before you can't make payroll and such that you can provide a reasonably accurate picture of accounts for the taxation authorities every year, balancing 50% off medium pizza promotions with the desire to not cannibalize the business of your regulars, etc etc, and by the way tomato sauce should be tangy but not sour and cheese should melt with just the faintest whisp of a crust on it.<p>Do you want to write software for a living?

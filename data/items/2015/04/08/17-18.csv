You write &quot;the contour of our wrist,&quot; but the contour of your wrist and of mine probably aren&#x27;t the same, right? So is the display flexible? Is it the same size for everyone? Will someone with a smaller wrist find the display &quot;wrapping around&quot; more than someone with a larger wrist? What interactions will be made <i>better</i> by such a curved display, and what interactions will be made <i>worse</i> by one? And is the tradeoff appropriate?",1428515959

I saw it hit hard when Smith Corona&#x27;s computer-y typewriters couldn&#x27;t keep up with gadget-y word processing software, and the typewriter died.

Elegantly, yes, or cheaply, if you like...but time and little else. Attempts to add computer-y function failed for a decade, succumbing to horrible interfaces and anemic UIs; the author completely overlooks the computer-y phases which watches have gone thru (and failed miserably).

However, the trust decisions are public, as this is what allows participants to discover quorums.  The scenario you describe of two groups of 100 participants overlapping at one node might or might not be a problem.  The most likely cause of such a topology is a Sybil attack, in which an attacker with one seat at the table gloms an extra 99 nodes onto the system that nobody trusts.  The attackers&#x27; 100 nodes might of course diverge if they are so configured, but nobody will care.<p>A priori, we cannot definitively answer what kind of topology will emerge.

It is difficult to define a surface area to this large volume, but if I were to suggest a few I would also add the Extended Mind Thesis and Nudge (or something like it).<p>Certainly. Take the Pew Research study on news media trends [1]. The majority of younger people are getting their news primarily or entirely from Facebook and Twitter - both of which have algorithms that decide and organize which news and information should populate each stream. What&#x27;s worse is that these algorithms are not only private, and difficult to understand in their ancillary affects, but also they are controlled by parties whose incentives are not in line with providing people with the information that helps them to be the most informed; and in fact what&#x27;s worse is both Facebook and Twitter are major stages for both state sponsored and funded propaganda and PR campaigns.<p>Beyond this, Google, Bing, Baidu and other search engines can not on principle provide links to news on regular search terms, as people do not and can not know what news has happened to search without first being introduced to it. In both search and news aggregation, these search algorithms prioritize items according to profiles they believe match the underlying personalities performing the search. First, the same fundamental problems are present in this search aggregation - studies have been done by governments on reordering search terms to get elections and population affects they desire (and wide scale search engine manipulation has been seen in at least one national election in India) and that for search engines the customer is not the person searching but the PR firms and advertizers who pay to use the searcher&#x27;s screen real estate establishing incentives which if not wrong on their face are askew and should call for transparency.<p>Now, this is before other effects are taken into consideration. Presuming aggregation were neither malicious, political or gamed by SEO and that somehow this aggregation is done in a way tailored only to the expectations and demands of the consuming entity. There exists what people call an &#x27;information bubble&#x27; of the sort Pynchon predicted I had quoted - where the availability of the information in theory is overshadowed by the immediacy and digestibility of the information that is familiar. And in fact, however anecdotal this may seem, this is my experience with myself and the people who I know. Effort beyond merely searching for new information must be sought. An imaginary and completely invented scenario is as follows: Some scandal happens within government and from outside the internet a left leaning young person hears about it. When they perform a search to get more information about this scandal they will almost certainly be presented - by a &#x27;well working&#x27; algorithm - a left leaning perspective on that event aimed towards a young audience cruely devoid of evidence that perspectives from the right, the middle, the top, the bottom, other countries, older people, etc even exist.<p>Adversarial case aside (e.g. United States Special Forces are known to purposefully surround the media consumption of adversaries and their families in crafted information bubbles to break their faith and ideologies), and poor incentive structure aside (e.g. Digg) there are significant challenges faced by the paternalistic arrangement of algorithmic management not the least of which is knowing the &#x27;ground truth&#x27; (a term scientists use to refer to the ideal objective result from an intelligence algorithm) and how far a complicated algorithm is from reaching it.<p>I tend to wax and wane, but I guess that&#x27;s what you asked for. :P<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/24/how-social-media-is-reshaping-news/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/24/how-social-m...</a>",1428515065

It&#x27;s basically correct about the beauty of SaaS, except for the obvious counter that high-margin businesses are a magnet for competition in the long run.<p>But it starts off with it&#x27;s very worst argument, the ultimate &#x27;99 argument even: analysts suggesting Instagram&#x27;s value increased 35-fold since acquisition based on the assumption that if it &quot;fully monetized&quot; it could contribute $2bn revenue (ie. at zero costs and zero discount rate you&#x27;re still looking at a 17 year time horizon to get $35bn from Instagram, which is about three lifetimes for youth-oriented media properties) It suggests that&#x27;s quite reasonable with reference to the stock price of yet-to-turn-a-profit Twitter.<p>It doesn&#x27;t get any better when it suggests the &quot;unicorns&quot; are different because they&#x27;re competing with non-tech-enabled businesses. That could have been a slide from the WebVan pitch deck. Plus it&#x27;s very, very wrong in the case of AirBnB: Sabre et al sewed up a large chunk of the profitable end of the distribution market by solving the technical problems of filling hotel rooms, and locking themselves into the infrastructure, before the <i>internet</i>. AirBnB has a flair for consumer marketing, but does that really make it worth more?<p>The argument that the &#x27;99 companies failed because the mass of consumers didn&#x27;t exist and the infrastructure wasn&#x27;t ready is true, but for any self-respecting bear that&#x27;s an indication of exactly why it could be worse than 99 when investors get cynical about companies peaking at hundreds of millions of users whilst still being unable to squeeze a respectable profit to justify their valuation.",1428514856

And it also sounds like there&#x27;s a little fear-of-failure in your procrastination habits.  Normally I try and avoid speaking for others but I only say this because it mirrors closely a lot of experiences I&#x27;ve had.  I remember feeling the same way partially through school and basically every day after.  I don&#x27;t have a solution for you, but I have some suggestions.  I remember at 26 feeling so old.  And it&#x27;s true - you are the oldest you have ever been.  And you always will be.  So you should probably forgo the obsessive comparison of your age with others.  But 26 is a great age - it&#x27;s probably the best time to be young.  You have more resources, but you can still go a little wild without really alienating anyone.  You still get to have adventures, you still get to make mistakes.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can do that when you&#x27;re much older too, but the stakes tend to get higher.  You have money saved up for years?  Take a long fantastic trip.  Alone.  Meet new people.  See new places.  Maybe it will relax you.  Maybe it will give you fresh ideas.  But at 26, I guarantee it will reshape you.  SE Asia is so incredibly cheap yet well-trodden, The US is sprawling and gorgeously diverse, Europe is a different adventure with every train you take, Africa is... wild.  Point being that you can start in your own backyard or halfway around the world, but you&#x27;re at a time where you can really take advantage of the experience.  Also, you&#x27;re probably better looking now than you&#x27;ll ever be again.  Take advantage of that while you can.<p>-jayce",1428514730

Skeptics doubted the worth of the iPhone specifically, because it was quite a bit different from other smartphones (e.g. no hardware keyboard).<p>Tablets were a bit different, as there were no popular tablets before the iPad. However, the general feeling as I recall it was that tablets as a concept were cool and useful, and it&#x27;s just that nobody had managed to do one well.<p>The iPod fit this as well. MP3 players were fairly popular and the advantages were obvious. iPod doubters were skeptical of the iPod specifically, not the general concept of portable digital music players.<p>The Apple Watch seems to be the opposite scenario.

From this side of the mirror?<p>I can sort of understand how you might not understand it if you have no idea what&#x27;s involved in being a parent.<p>But you do seem to be ignoring some stuff:<p>i) The biological imperative.  Not everyone has this, and it&#x27;s important not to stigmatise people who just don&#x27;t want to be parents.  But it&#x27;s strongly there for many people, so having children seems to be important.<p>ii) &quot;You stuck your penis in someone (assuming you are male). That&#x27;s all you did.&quot; well, it&#x27;s not that easy.  For some parents it&#x27;s a lot more difficult than that; and a few adopting parents don&#x27;t even have the stage involving biological gloop.<p><a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2295.aspx?CategoryID=54"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2295.aspx?CategoryID=54</a><p>> Most couples (about 84 out of every 100) will get pregnant within a year if they have regular sex and don’t use contraception. However, women become less fertile as they get older. A recent study has found that couples having regular unprotected sex:<p>> aged 19-26 - 92% will conceive after one year and 98% after two years<p>> aged 35-39 - 82% will conceive after one year and 90% after two years<p>iii) For most parents it&#x27;s a big step.  They make a concious choice to stop contraception and to start trying for a child; or they start the adoption process.  It&#x27;s not like buying a car or changing job - both of which are pretty significant life changes for some people.<p>iv) Oxytocin<p>v) sleep deprivation and some form of domestic Stockholm Syndrome.  You have to give up so much for a child, and your life totally changes in ways that you can&#x27;t fully predict until it happens.  So you kind of have to say how brilliant it is.<p>vi) The fresh perspective a child has will teach you about the world.  You learn most when you teach someone else. Watching a child learn how to manipulate a toy or learn to read is enriching.<p>And so many people repeat this - that children radically change their lives, and that their children are the best thing they&#x27;ve ever done - that I&#x27;m surprised you haven&#x27;t considered whether it might be more significant than just &quot;You stuck your penis in someone&quot;.<p>(I don&#x27;t know much about adoption but I do know some very kind, loving, great parents who adopted so I&#x27;m trying to be inclusive of their experiences.)",1428514199

Do you use them better and well? Do they span the tech stack or are they all concentrated in areas (frontend, db engines ... etc)? The more the better, but also quality of use is important. When you look at a code base and know exactly how to debug an issue because you know exactly how the views/models/db are synced up in that framework you will produce faster ... hence you are better<p>2)Do you have a process to coding? Good but why did you choose that process? If you dont have one then try to make one. You have some experience programming so you should be able to look at history of projects created and understand how you could have implemented them better. Make a process for frontend ui, for testing, for db migrations, for commiting code ... for every part of your process and iterate. Have an opinion on why you do the things you do. Use logic. You might not have the most efficient process but any process will make you more efficient and most importantly youll have something to compare with others so that you can swap their better techniques in later or mix them with your own.<p>3)I think interviewing can be the best way to test yourself.

In spite of requests by myself and several others (E.g. Andrew Miller) Ripple never formalized the topology requirement, much less how users are to go about achieving it. This paper goes forward in formalizing it, but still provides no guidance on achieving it; and absent that the only reliably way I know to achieve it is to have a central authority dictate trust.  (*Ripple, as-deployed, centrally administers the &quot;trust&quot;; and Stellar faulted when it failed to do so and switched to a fully centralized approach (at least temporarily))<p>Consider a trivial example of two fully meshed subgraphs of 100 nodes each with an overlap of a single node. Assuming that each nodes behavior is tolerant to at least one ill behaved node, then both of the subgroups can come to a consensus (achieving at least 99 out of 100) about mutually exclusive state, and this can happen spontaneously without any attacker.  More complicated partitioning-- ones involving many nodes in the min-cut, or more than two partitions-- are possible, to avoid it there must be &#x27;sufficient&#x27; overlap.<p>Deciding on what the &#x27;trust&#x27; topology must be to achieve safety requires non-local (and presumably private) information about what everyone else in the network trusts. The required minimum set of additional edges to make any particular natural trust topology into a safe one may have no relationship to whom anyone actually finds trustworthy in the real world. As far as I can tell no mechanism is proposed to establish a safe topology; just &quot;the responsibility of each node&quot;.<p>To me that sounds a lot like saying &quot;It is the responsibility of each node to not connect to any faulty nodes.&quot; Its a very strong assumption.<p>Separately,  this system proposes a kind of consensus which is weaker with respect to blocking than e.g. Bitcoins.  This is perhaps made most obvious by the point at the end about being unable to use the consensus to safely arbitrate global parameters (like system settings or version upgrades), something we do regularly in Bitcoin.  It isn&#x27;t clear to me why the authors believe that the system is fit for cryptocurrency use when it cannot guarantee eventual agreement about _all_ of the state. In Bitcoin the transaction &#x27;light-cone&#x27; from coins splitting and merging appears to grow exponentially for most coins, so a failure to reach consensus on one transaction would eventually block most transactions. It&#x27;s not clear to me if all participants could reliably detect stuck statuses and avoid dependance on them (if they could, why cant consensus continue). I&#x27;ll need to read more carefully to understand this point.",1428513733

That way it&#x27;s possible to make unbiased statements about the distribution of planet sizes and orbits, the fraction of stars with planets, etc.",1428513258

9342282,comment,9341687,9342080,0,0,spolu,,,"(disclaimer: I had early access to the white paper for review)<p>Sybil attacks are not really directly applicable here since each node in the system picks its own quorum slices (basically the set of nodes that it trusts). There is no notion of global reputation and nodes do not need to know every other nodes to participate. Looking at the definition of quorum intersection[0] section 4.1 should give you a sense of the conditions that are required on the choice of quorum slices for the network to function properly (quorum intersection ensures safety)<p>The proof exposed in the paper guarantees safety and liveness for the network provided a certain number of reasonable conditions are held true. What that means is that an attacker cannot force on intact nodes (definition p14) invalid transactions nor prevent the network from making progress.<p>That being said, (at least in the version I reviewed) there is no guarantee provided with respect to ensuring that all valid transaction will eventually make it into the network. Indeed a set of highly trusted nodes (present in a lot of quorum slices) could attempt to preempt a specific set of transactions X (originated by edge nodes) by opportunistically broadcasting valid transaction set V_i for each successive ledger entry i that explicitly do not include the targeted set of transactions X. Under raw SCP as described in the paper and for certain topologies this preemption could be real and this is the closest I can think of a Sybil attack. It&#x27;s important to note that we still have liveness and safety in that case.<p>I believe the same kind of attacks to be plausible with the Bitcoin network and I know protection mechanisms against it are currently being evaluated by David, Jed and the rest of the team. I will let them share their progress when they think it&#x27;s right. I also hope they will correct me if I stated anything inaccurate here!<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pd...</a>",1428513238

These are the simple financial facts of insurance.<p>While individuals do have a choice of whether to procreate (and it&#x27;s not always a choice), society as a whole does not. Without procreation the economy and society would quickly collapse and the human race would eventually come to and end. So there&#x27;s tremendous societal benefit to procreation and it should be supported by any government which society chooses to put in place. What you&#x27;re suggesting would insentivize large numbers of people to not have any children, which is harmful to society and the wider economy. Indeed, without parents, you yourself would not exist.<p>A world in which you don&#x27;t have to incur costs for others&#x27;s children, is a world in which the benefits of those children should arguably be denied to you: no pension, lesser pay because you can&#x27;t sell to children (or adults once those children are grown up), expensive services because you won&#x27;t be allowed to use young cheap labor, no universities, larger tax and medical burdens as your own generation becomes older and more sickly, no hip young music or art, no interactions with people more than 25 years younger, no younger workers at your company as it grows, no technologies invented by or provided by those children in their adulthood, etc. Since you didn&#x27;t contribute to raising the children, it&#x27;s only fair that you don&#x27;t get to reap the rewards, right?<p>The fact is that as a member of society and our economy, you derive a huge financial benefit from other&#x27;s children which is inescapable.

Your self worth is clearly tied into that list of accomplishments; why is that so? Maybe try writing down a list of reasons why you believe accomplishment is the greatest measure of your own worth, and see if they make logical sense to you when you think deeply about them.<p>At the same time, ask yourself why you procrastinate. Come up with a list of reasons for that as well. Probably a strong reason is that you&#x27;re afraid of failure (since you need successful accomplishments so badly to feel self worth). Only when the anxiety of not finishing anything outweighs the anxiety of failing something do you not procrastinate. This is what happens when your primary motivator is anxiety.<p>Thirdly, ask yourself why in particular minimizing (age/accomplishments) is so important to you. If you live an average lifespan, you still have 2/3 of your life left to accomplish what you want. If you started from scratch now, you could still make major contributions to most fields in under 10 years time. If you&#x27;re worried about declining brain health with age, do things which minimize the decline (avoiding excessive anxiety is probably a good place to start).<p>Consider that most people regret not spending enough time with friends and family, not fully appreciating life, and not communicating how they really feel, when they die.

But it is a story about mastery, and surrendering that fear of not measuring up.<p>Back around 2000, I got my dream job: I started working at Spümcø, the animation studio responsible for &quot;Ren & Stimpy&quot;. At one point I was working closely with Jim Smith, whose work is <i>amazing</i> - I normally don&#x27;t give a shit about the big muscle dudes he loves to draw, but he does it with such grace and fluidity that these big beefchunks become beautiful.<p>I was in awe of his casual knowledge of every single muscle in the human body, and the ability to deploy that knowledge in his art. I would never measure up.<p>Then one day he brought in some old work. Kid work, teenage work. I looked at it and a lot of it was <i>terrible</i> - awkward posing, horrible proportions, a whole bunch of general classes of errors that I recognized from looking back at <i>my</i> teenage drawings.<p>I looked at the dates. These drawings were older than I am. And it was like a light was switched on in the back of my head: of <i>course</i> Jim could draw rings around me with half his brain tied behind his back; he&#x27;d started before I was even <i>born</i>.<p>Since then, I have looked at artists who are better than me at one thing or another with occasional envy in my eyes. And then it instantly dissipates, because I know I could learn to do what they do better if I want to spend a few years on it - do I want that in my toolset bad enough?<p>And that realization freed me. I was able to look coldly at my work and decide that, yes, I&#x27;m good enough to get hired, I&#x27;m better at cartooning than like 90% of the people out there. I had the confidence then to embark on a year-long art project (drawing a Tarot deck), and then to move on to a four-year project (drawing a graphic novel) that I&#x27;m almost done with. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve worked on the comic every day by any means. But more often than not, I make myself spend at least a half hour on it. There&#x27;s always <i>something</i> I can do without having to load the entire story into my head to turn it over and think about the shape it should be. And if I&#x27;ve only spent a half hour at the end of a day, it&#x27;s still a half hour closer to being done than if I&#x27;d just spent the day playing video games.<p>Step outside of the fear of failure, the envy of younger, more successful people. Look at them as things your brain is doing and ask yourself why; treat it as a programming problem if that metaphor works for you. And find a way to make time for your own projects, even if it&#x27;s just a half hour in the morning most days.<p>Let go, slack off, unclench your brain.",1428512730

There are plenty of business-unfriendly countries in this world that somehow retain businesses. In the real world, there&#x27;s friction.<p>In my cursory research, I find 2 to be, once again, a liberal-democratic assumption which relies on our particular barrier between public and private. This barrier doesn&#x27;t exist the same way everywhere: some corporations operate as extensions of nationalistic projects. Gazprom&#x27;s relationship to Russia is different than Apple&#x27;s relationship to the US. Samsung (and other Chaebol corporations) has a different relationship to the Korean nation than Google has with the US.",1428512470

People like Sid Sackson, Phil Orbanes, Richard Hamblen, Francis Tresham and others created the modern era - and amazing, modern-feeling games such as Square Mile[1962] would sometimes appear out of nowhere.<p>edit: Seriously - German Family games don&#x27;t even exist without Kohle, Kie$ & Knete and Acquire. Lastly, the influence of Gary Gygax on the landscape can&#x27;t be overestimated. This is really not useful for understanding modern gaming.<p>edit2: I want to add so much more to this that it&#x27;s better to just stop now - but a history of board games that reduces Parker Brothers to Monopoly (which they stole), Risk (which is French), Sorry (which is Parcheesi), and Trivial Pursuit but gives a paragraph to the Conan Board Game is not a good history.",1428512463

It&#x27;s unfortunate that there is such negative baggage associated with therapy -- I have found it to be immensely helpful in learning more about myself and how to manage my own anxiety and depression (key word being &quot;manage&quot; -- these are aspects of who you are and can&#x27;t be changed, but you can learn to accept them and deal with them instead of just wishing them to go away).

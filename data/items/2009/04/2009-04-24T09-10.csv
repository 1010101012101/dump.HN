XP) saves you lot of time in configuring stuff as compared to *nix (not considering mac). Of course it restricts you a lot but with tools like GnuWin32 etc. you can create quite a powerful dev box.<p>Once I decided to install Ubuntu 8.04 in one of my machines but X didn't work due to some conflict with the graphics card. After lot of forum browsing and hair pulling, I finally went to #ubuntu on irc.freenode.net to beg for some help. I explained them the problem I was having and casually told them ""I'm using Windows right now"". The reply was ""You mean, struggling with Windows?"". Yeah right!",1240566427

427837,comment,427743,427743,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"When I started having problems about 7 year ago, I did a handful of things, but the two that made the most difference were:<p>Better chair (Aeron).  Sounds odd, I guess, but being the right height and having good posture makes a difference.  I also dropped the arms way down, so I simply cannot lean on them no matter how lazy I'm feeling (among many other pains, my left elbow had a permanent twinge of pain, which still pops up now and then, but was always-on back then).<p>Tiling window manager.  This assumes UNIX/Linux, but it made a difference when I almost completely killed the mouse from my life.  If typing is more painful than mousing for you, this might not be the right choice.  It helped for me, though...I immediately was able to work full days again due to this change, though I don't know if it was therapeutic...it may have just avoided the most serious pains.<p>Other things that may or may not have helped, but I did them while recovery was clearly happening:<p>Changing positions frequently.  Keyboard slanted/flat.  Raising and lowering the chair.  Occasionally sitting in a different chair or on a ball or standing.  Getting up and walking about a lot.<p>Exercises that encouraged blood flow to the affected areas.  Cardiovascular exercise in general, but tennis and such were my focus.  You've already tried swimming...so that's probably in the same league for circulation.  I wouldn't quit doing those things, even though they haven't resolved your problem...I doubt they're hurting.<p>I cut back dramatically on playing guitar and piano, since they incurred very similar sorts of repetitive stress.  This one was not pleasant, but now I can play again without any problems.",1231580004

A lot of the tension I get seems to arise in the neck and upper back areas. I feel great when I get out of the gym or after a hot bath but I work in a pretty high pressure environment where I sometimes can't take breaks for hours at a time. Maybe that's the real problem. But I was hoping for a workaround.",1231579887

427828,comment,427740,427740,0,0,pauljonas,,,"Palm’s embrace of “developer friendly” open platform philosophy for its new handset in development, in constrast to the decidedly unfriendly sandbox approach Apple has taken, certainly must be applauded.  And a flock of delighted developers are cheering them on, as indicated by the cited article discussion, as well as tech sites across the net. However, I see no reference to a factor that looms larger than software platform — quality of the hardware.<p>Palm devices (PDA and their foray into mobile phone market space) are notorious for their unreliability and low quality. Historically, they are poorly made and break rather easily. Back when I toted a Palm PDA in my work travels, it frequently had to be replaced. And I remember giant pallets of refurbished PDAs in Fry’s Electronics, where devices would be recycled for second and subsequent deaths.<p>Experience with Blackberry devices, I do not have, but my iPhone performance and reliability (other than on OS upgrade days) has been stellar. In fact, the iPhone is more solid that it was nearly 15 months ago.  I have not even witnessed battery degradation yet on my first generation model. Yes, I realize there are iPhone lemons, but I’d assess the iPhone defect rate at a fraction of all those Palm products.",1231578598

The clear intent is to make the speaker seem simultaneously knowledgable enough about other cultures to make a fair comparison and slightly daring -- nay, a latter day Solzhenitsyn, such is one's daring.<p>That's not the stupid part, just boring vanity. The stupid part is those people who buy into it. Few of these people have ever lived in other societies (I've lived in two.)",1231578448

Using your mouse other handed will feel very clumsy for a few days, and you probably won't ever want to play a game that way.

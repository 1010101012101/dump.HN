133911,comment,133325,133325,0,0,giardini,,,"""In the early 19th century, subject matter that made up the liberal arts curriculum was fixed: the ancient classics, rhetoric, logic, Greek and Latin.""<p>With the possible exceptions of Greek and Latin, liberal arts colleges should restore these core courses. To those they should require advanced coursework in probability, statistics, biology and psychology.<p>Probability and statistics are essential elements of thinking and are extensions of rhetoric and logic. Biology and psychology have undergone such change and are so significant to modern scientific and social thought that they should be required.<p>""Your life will be fuller and richer if you read Aristotle, Descartes and Rousseau.""<p>Yes, but such studies should be limited to the first 2 years of a 4-year curriculum, so that sufficient time for  later courses in biology and psychology is available. These courses would point out the errors in the assumptions or reasoning that those earlier philosophers made and bring the student up-to-date with current knowledge of biological, physiological, psychological and social systems.<p>A graduate of such a program would be educated in the classical sense but more current in his knowledge than the typical liberal arts graduate. He would be very valuable as a potential employee in almost any field, since he was taught primarily to _think_.",1205211280

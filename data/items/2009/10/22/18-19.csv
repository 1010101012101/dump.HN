Since this article is still on the front page I would like to ask HN how does one deal with the similar issue of letting a young girl know she's pretty without suggesting it's of central importance?  The problem is physical attractiveness is more inate than intelligence.  I think the best course is to suggest innate attractivness is happy chance to be taken advantage of, generally it should be treated with indifference.  I don't want my little sister to be swept off her feet by the first boy who gives her flowers, but you don't want her to ignore any advantages she may have.

In practice you are not.<p>I don't know the terms of the deal, but suppose that Y-combinator had a 10% stake in a startup, and Sequoia gets 1/4 of that.  Let's suppose you're looking at a round of financing that would dilute that ownership by half.  Then Sequoia's investment amounts to an extra 1.25% stake in the company post deal.  So if they could get a 50% stake in another company that has a 2% better returns, they would get a 1% better returns from the better company and a 1.25% better returns from their stake, and therefore should go for the Y-combinator company.  Right?<p>Wrong.  Sequoia knows that if they pass on something that is almost good enough for them, it is still likely to be picked up by someone else.  (Particularly if they let people know that it was borderline.)  So they have to think through the difference of having them versus the next VC investing in that opportunity.  There is a difference, but it is not actually that big.  Therefore even a 1% difference in the two companies should not change their decision.<p>And when they are making these decisions, there is no way they are trying to measure things to 1% accuracy.  So the right thing for them to do is ignore their stake in the Y-combinator investment entirely.",1256237608

Even with an ideal randomized experiment that shows the exact size of the causal effect on individuals, we would know little about the causal effect on a macro level.<p>Imagine if all doctors had to put $10,000 into a fire pit or else be prohibited by law from practicing a certain lucrative form of medicine. If you ran a controlled randomized experiment, you could easily establish a causal (yes, <i>causal</i>) relationship between throwing money in the fire pit and increased future earnings. This would not make throwing money in the pit any less stupid.<p>College is a resource sink that no rational individual acting in their own self-interest (with a few rare exceptions) can refuse. It's rational for individuals to go to college to get better jobs, and it's rational for employers to discriminate against non-grads to avoid bad employees, but at the end of the day we're still throwing money into an ever-growing fire pit of crushed beer bottles, cannabis seeds, and Playstation controllers.",1256237599

Its simplicity has enabled the spread of the web. In addition it provided a means for some semantic marking of documents through tagging. It was not meant to be a graphical language (see SVG for that!) When it came out there were actually no browsers and most computers were still displaying graphics with herculer cards.<p>Once microcomputer technology caught up a bit, fancier documents and graphics started appearing and HTML still coped. It still copes even with fancy web applications. In the meantime computer languages appeared and disappeared, desktop software morphed from DOS to Windows 7.<p>CSS was the answer to presentational issues. It got limitations yes and it gives people difficulties, but so Haskell for me but I never tried to blame my own deficiencies to a 'badly designed' language. Yes CSS does not provide for rounded corners, but it does allow you to display the same content for print, handheld devices, auditory devices as well as feel the text in braille!<p>Most important this separation enables easier indexing of web pages which is next to impossible to index with graphical based systems.",1256237563

897322,comment,897050,897050,0,0,stanleydrew,,,"As a former PhD student in economics I can tell you that this kind of research is often not very well done. Having not read the paper I will reserve final judgement, but based on the journal it's published in this probably doesn't hold much weight. Here's why:<p>In order to say anything causal (as the author of this paper would like to) in a field where you can't run experiments and only have observational data you need to have a source of identification. It's not enough to compare means. Yes this has everything to do with unobserved-variable bias.<p>In labor economics the huge unobserved variable is ability. People who are naturally more ""able"" will likely earn more than less able people and also will likely obtain more education. If that is true then it will look like education is much more important in determining earnings/wages than it actually is.<p>So there are all these ways of trying to eliminate that unobserved-variable bias. The popular one in the 90s and early 00s (and still popular today despite a lot of criticism) is the instrumental variables technique. Here's the idea:<p>We need to introduce a source of randomness into our otherwise non-random data. If we can find a variable that is correlated with the causal variable we are interested in, but (arguably) uncorrelated with the unobserved variable, then we can use that new variable as an ""instrument."" I won't get into the technical details of how to run the regressions with actual data, but this method basically uses an external source of randomness to attempt to say something causal.<p>The classic paper on this is Josh Angrist's and Alan Kreuger's paper estimating returns to education. They used Vietnam draft lottery numbers as their instrument, since your draft lottery number should be completely uncorrelated with your natural ""ability,"" but definitely would correlate with how much education you got (those having to serve couldn't go to school). More on that paper is here: <a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/priindrel/670.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/priindrel/670.htm</a>.<p>So basically I doubt that this community college paper does much of the required analysis to actually ""identify"" the causal relationship it is claiming to have found.<p>UPDATE: Having read the methodology (page 7) portion of the paper (link to the pdf at the bottom of this page: <a href=""http://userpages.umbc.edu/~marcotte/pubs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userpages.umbc.edu/~marcotte/pubs.htm</a>) I can confirm that my doubts were justified (the author also makes some highly questionable assumptions in order to estimate individuals' work experience as well, but I won't get into that). The author does acknowledge that unobserved variables will confound the results, and attempts to eliminate the bias by controlling for underlying ability with standardized high school math and reading exam scores. This is a common method, but it's really not good enough. We are still dealing with observational data, and we still haven't been presented a source of identification. That is, even if two people scored exactly the same on their high school math and reading exams, but one went to community college and the other didn't, you still haven't accounted for whatever underlying differences existed to lead each to make a different choice.",1256235608

But with Step 3, you can spend your time learning about full-stack web development. You&#x27;ll have to learn some back-end stuff, improve your front-end stuff, design, art, graphics, etc.<p>Once your MVP is up and running, then you&#x27;ll have to move into sales and marketing and learn that part of the business. Come up with some kind of monetization strategy and implement it as part of the product.<p>While doing all this, split your time between building this thing up, and applying for your next gig. Bonus, when your MVP is up, put it on your resume so future employers can go see it and eliminate that gap in employment right off your resume.<p>You now have a portfolio, business experience, sales & marketing experience, executive experience, product development, design, QA, art, improved technical skills and no gap on your resume since you&#x27;ve &quot;been working&quot; the entire time.<p>There are many employers who would kill to have employees with that kind of experience, and it shows you can turn a minus into an opportunity.<p>Bonus, if you can&#x27;t find a job, keep plugging away at it and maybe your startup will turn into something.",1422716383

8976843,comment,8972066,8972066,0,0,Hello71,,,"> No protection from getting your job done: Security can often be a hassle, getting in the way of your work. Sandstorm is different. When you tell a Sandstorm app to talk to some other app, or to talk to the internet, Sandstorm sees your intent and automatically grants it access. So, you are never interrupted by a prompt asking &quot;Do you want to allow this app to the thing you just told it to do?&quot; And yet, the apps only get the permissions you actually wanted them to have.<p>So... the program is psychic?",1422716312

8976789,comment,8976451,8976541,0,0,netcan,,,"I think part of the discipline problem is the solipsism of our times.<p>In an army, your environment provides discipline and (often) fosters motivation for (for example) fitness. A fitness class reduces the need to discipline & self motivation to getting yourself to the class. After that, the environment takes care of itself. Self discipline and self motivation is a problematic subset of discipline and we&#x27;re not really wired to run on it exclusively.<p>This is part of why you need a partner to start a startup. Having discipline and motivation together is easier than alone. It&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think online education can replace institutional education (though I think it can make it much better) as the default mode. It&#x27;s why even in one-on-one sports like tennis or boxing young athletes are on &quot;teams.&quot;",1422715086

But it is much easier to be disciplined if you have the real motivation that comes from a clear understanding of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.<p>It may also be the case that you realise that the reason you have to force yourself to do something is that you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it. If you hate your job and the spreadsheets that come with it then why are you doing it? The answer could be simple: &quot;money&quot; but in that case there is always the possibility to do something else to achieve that - it is incredibly liberating!<p>Blindly focusing on discipline is a sure way to one day wake up and realise that what you have been doing is of no importance and that is a hard realisation to come to. If you are lucky, then it is still not too late to do something about it, but the best thing is to never get to that situation in the first place.<p>Anyway, just my 2 pence - it&#x27;s worked out pretty well for me so far... ;-)",1422715045

It would be nice if folks didn&#x27;t trot out football or baseball when talking to me.  If I had to learn to suppress my enthusiasms except around the like-minded, why haven&#x27;t they?",1422713373

As much as I love Super Metroid (which, despite her criticisms, I think is superior in gameplay and puzzle-platforming), she is spot-on about the ham-fisting of the story.<p>We should all write like this about video games from our past that made us feel something special.<p>> Samus’ motives in keeping the last metroid alive are unclear: are they purely utilitarian, or has she had a change of heart? The game’s rules, possibly mirroring Samus’ wishes, don’t allow for the metroid baby to be killed—bullets seem to barely miss or pass through the metroid. Of course, killing the metroid would doom Samus to a slow death deep underground, but this is not immediately apparent.<p>I didn&#x27;t ever think about that until just now!",1422713099

8976713,comment,8972179,8972179,0,0,wtbob,,,"You know, growing up I absolutely loathed sports.  I didn&#x27;t understand them (we never watched them in my house), and sports-lovers never explained them; I still remember my gym &#x27;teacher&#x27; yelling about &#x27;first and ten&#x27; when we had to play flag football, and never actually explaining what it meant.  I wasn&#x27;t any good at them, due at least in part to my bad eyes.  In retrospect, I suspect that I also disliked them, whether played or watched, because they were a social situation and I wasn&#x27;t terribly good at social situations.<p>In retrospect, I do kind of wish that I&#x27;d gotten into them, because they are a bonding experience for so many, and they do provide the grounds for a somewhat better level of small talk than idle chit-chat about the weather.  And they certainly can be enjoyable to play.<p>But as it is, I just don&#x27;t emotionally get it.  Watching sports is <i>boring</i>; it simply doesn&#x27;t connect.  Why should I care if a group of millionaires from my town are running around on some grass with a group of millionaires from your town?  Why should I be happy that my taxes are higher in order to raise money for buildings for those same millionaires?  Why would I want to spend hours a week and hundreds of dollars watching rich people exercise, talking about rich people exercising and thinking about rich people exercising?<p>It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  Part of me wishes it did; obviously I am unlike most people.  But part of me is glad, too.  In some ways, I feel like the little boy in the The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes; in others I feel like I&#x27;m blind.<p>As an aside, I thought this quote was just hilarious:<p>> The machoness and absence of women in the highest levels of most professional sports bothers[sic] me deeply.<p>I really wonder how one can have working eyes, possess a functioning brain and have come to adulthood and still be surprised that in almost any physical competition the absolute best competitors will be male.  It takes a pretty sincere dedication to being disconnected from reality to manage that.  It&#x27;d be like saying, &#x27;avian over-representation and the absence of fish from the air bother me deeply.&#x27;",1422713049

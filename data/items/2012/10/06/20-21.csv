You can then measure the curve of subjective satisfaction with their lives and value can be defined as ""the impact of a good or service on the satisfaction curve of a recipient's life"".<p>Tying value to the subjective experience of the outcomes is qualitatively different than tying value to subjective beliefs about the goods or services.<p>For example, someone might buy a million dollar McMansion because they subjectively believe it's valuable to them, and then discover that they're miserable in it because it's horribly designed, poorly constructed, and expensive to maintain. That's fundamentally different from someone who buys a house that is cheap to heat and cool, makes their everyday tasks easier, and causes the release of pleasure chemicals in a sustainable and helpful way.<p>The latter has intrinsic value in a way the former doesn't.<p>Edit: You can also define value as the ability for a good to increase your overall wealth. So, some goods have a cost, and do nothing to my net worth (lottery ticket). But some, if you look at the longer term, have a cost, but also add to my net worth (buying a soy milk maker). If you put a dollar value on your experiences, this can cover everything.",1349556961

In fact, it's not even a good reason, because it forces me to spend money.<p>Deflation doesn't discourage spending by itself. The price of holding to the money is the lost opportunity of investing those money into something else. I'd say, generally saving money is a good thing rather than bad because it allows me to only invest them when I consider the opportunity good enough. Presently, inflation punishes me if I save money. So, if we talk about particular individuals saving money, inflation is not a good thing for them. It might be good for specific groups of people who receive the money I spend, but then one might say it is good for them at my expense.

My mistake - I'm not familiar enough yet with economists vocabulary and perspective.<p>If the economy is not growing as fast as your currency supply is, I'd prefer calling that ""purchasing power"" deflation since I think on the purchaser side - and you will get less and less stuff for a given amount of your money (while of course the token price will inflate - sorry if this was not clear)<p>Besides that twist, I don't agree with your conclusions.<p>It's all about perspective, and IMHO you are too clear cut.<p>Currencies being inflationary in a growing economy - it's good if you are productive and don't have much capital. It's not good if you are not productive but already have acquired capital, because you must then do something - like invest or spend - or you will be less well-off.<p>There is a clear link between spending, investment and economical activity, but saying that this link is better to the alternative - the link between not spending, not investing and not trading is all about one's values.<p>(I mean, like many here I share your opinion, hence my initial remark about bitcoin not being good for economic growth, but many leftists and ""deflating"" folks would say that it would be better for the planet and so on if we stopped growing and even inverted the tendency)<p>Likewise, half of the bitcoin being held by the inventor is a good thing for this inventor, and is a statement of how good he think his product is.

The PE exam topics are also generally known to lag reality, regardless of discipline, and often by a decade. It's also open book and some people bring entire carts of books, though I find that not to be very effective since you basically only have six minutes per question.<p>The major part of the application process is that you will need to work under the direct supervision of a PE, and have increasing levels of documented responsibility, which is often harder to satisfy. Depending on the state, three of the five (minimum) of your recommendations must come from licensed PEs, who need to be able to certify more about you than simply your character.<p>Usually when threads like this appear, too much emphasis is placed on the exam rather than the requirements that allow you to sit for the exam in the first place. The PE license process is not like a Microsoft or Cisco certification. It took me a good six months to get all the paperwork ready to apply for the exam. I minimally studied for the exam itself.

I do not know why people always assume that treating your employees well is some type of waste.<p>Think about this -- how much does a competent IT person cost per hour? How much does an engineer cost per hour? Some engineers cost up to $100 per hour once you add all the incentives and incidental costs.<p>Now what happens when an engineer has a broken keyboard in an old fashioned ""frugal"" company? He has to call tech support and he has to wait and he gets the perfect excuse not to do work. Tech support will not show up immediately, because this is a ""frugal"" company, so they do not have people in tech support just sitting around waiting for someone to get a broken keyboard. Oh no, they are frugal and have their support people's schedules full, which means that $100 an hour engineer gets to wait a couple of hours till the support person comes.<p>But in ""wasteful"" Zynga, that same engineer can go and replace his own keyboard for 5 minutes. That office supply vebding machine seems like a brilliant idea to me. Of course it is a vending machine, so it presumably keeps track of who takes what, so nobody can just take a bunch of stuff and resell it on the street.<p>The thing about the organic chips is a great idea too. It takes so much longer for anybody to go somewhere and buy something. And if a programmer goes out of the office he loses context, which means it may take him another hour to soak up the context of everything he was doing. Oh and if you eat unhealthy food or drink sugary drinks you can easily spend an entire afternoon in food/sugar coma. Of course one should not waste food regardless of how much they paid for this, but that can be solved by social measures.<p>I do not know why investors get their hearts warmed up by the suffering of their companies' employees but this is usually very counterproductive.<p>Google is very successful and is famous for their perks. Outsiders make fun of them, but Google management knows better.

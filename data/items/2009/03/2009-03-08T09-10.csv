507136,comment,506739,506739,0,0,olavk,,,"It is strange he proposes a HTML4.2 without any hint of what it actually will contain, except fluffy words like ""simplify"", ""streamline"" and so on. This is actually what XHTML and XHTML2 attempted - by means of the draconian error handling all parsing ambiguities would disappear, making parsing much simpler. By eliminating all legacy presentational HTML, the vocabulary would get much simpler and so on.<p>The problem with XHTML was that is was too simple and elegant, and didn't consider the actual state of the web: There are already billions of malformed documents, and they dont go away just because you declare them illegal.<p>HTML5 on the other hand accepts and embraces the actuale state of the web. By declaring rules for how to parse malformed HTML, it attempts to solve the major source of interoperability problems between browsers. But this also requires a much more complex spec.<p>I don't like peddling conspiracy theories, but I have to mention that Crockfords attack at ECMAScript 4 only succeeded because of backing by Microsoft. Microsoft supports Crockfords notion that JavaScript absolutely does not need high-level features like classes, type annotations, packages and so on - we are fine with a minimal language, thank you! While at the same time focusing significant ressources to support C# (a much larger language than ES4) as a client side language through Silverlight.<p>Crockford worked in secret with Microsoft on ECMAScript 3.1 before it went public, and I suspect this announcement means that they are working on a HTML4.2 proposal. And I am pretty sure this HTML4.2 will <i>not</i> cointain features like canvas, audio and video, since these features is a selling point of Silverlight relative to HTML.",1236506101

507134,comment,506917,506982,0,0,whughes,,,"Amazon.com/wii is not a reference to the Wii itself. The article's author got it wrong there, or at least fudged the truth slightly. It's a category on the Amazon site. Thus, amazon.com/books works (as someone else said), but shamwow doesn't. Shamwow isn't a category, after all. I assume they do have shortening for categories, and they just keep their structure consistent.",1236505648

All those iPod users managed to ""install a new filesystem driver"" just fine.<p>Not as convenient as the ""just works"" FAT on USB, perhaps, but hardly an insurmountable problem. I'm surprised they're not bundling some kind of management program already - asking users to manually arrange files on USB sticks seems a bit fiddly.",1236505123

507129,comment,506739,506861,0,0,olavk,,,"The ""data"" prefix is indeed for the sake of namespacing. This is actually quite useful since you can validate and e.g. find typos in ordinary attributes while still having your custom data attributes.<p>If you have some good ideas for HTML5, you just post a well-argued message on the open mailing list (<a href=""http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list</a>), and it will be considered.",1236504414

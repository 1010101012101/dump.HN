(although the language is here called ""Dash"", but they could have changed its name since last November which the mail apparently dates from) From the supposed internal email:<p>Javascript has fundamental flaws that cannot be fixed merely by evolving the
language.  We'll adopt a two-pronged strategy for the future of Javascript:<p><pre><code>   - Harmony (low risk/low reward): continue working in conjunction with
   TC39 (the EcmaScript standards body) to evolve Javascript
   - Dash (high risk/high reward): Develop a new language (called Dash) that
   aims to maintain the dynamic nature of Javascript but have a better
   performance profile and be amenable to tooling for large projects. Push for
   Dash to become an open standard and be adopted by other browsers. Developers
   using Dash tooling will be able to use a cross-compiler to target Javascript
   for browsers that do not support Dash natively.</code></pre>
[...]
Javascript has been a part of the web platform since its infancy, but the
web has begun to outgrown it.   The web development community has been
backed into using large amounts of JS largely to work around the
deficiencies in the platform.   Complex web apps--the kind that Google
specializes in--are struggling against the platform and working with a
language that cannot be tooled and has inherent performance problems.[...]
 The emergence of
compelling alternative platforms like iOS has meant that the web platform
must compete on its merits, not just its reach.  Javascript as it exists
today will likely not be a viable solution long-term.  Something must
change.[...]
The clean break option is extremely high risk--it will be a huge challenge
to convince other browser vendors to rally around a new language--but is the
only way to escape the historic problems with Javascript.  Thus, its high
risk is matched by the potential for a very high reward--a classic leapfrog
strategy.
[...]
Dash is designed with three perspectives in mind:<p><pre><code>   - Performance -- Dash is designed with performance characteristics in
   mind, so that it is possible to create VMs that do not have the performance
   problems that all EcmaScript VMs must have.
   - Developer Usability -- Dash is designed to keep the dynamic,
   easy-to-get-started, no-compile nature of Javascript that has made the web
   platform the clear winner for hobbyist developers.
   - Ability to be Tooled -- Dash is designed to be more easily tooled (e.g.
   with optional types) for large-scale projects that require
   code-comprehension features such as refactoring and finding callsites.
    Dash, however, does not require tooling to be effective--small-scale
   developers may still be satisfied with a text editor.
</code></pre>
Dash is also designed to be securable, where that ability does not seriously
conflict with the three main goals.<p>Dash will be designed to be consumed in a number of locations:<p><pre><code>   - Browser VM -- Our aspiration is that Dash will ultimately be a viable
   substitute for Javascript as the native client-side language of choice
   across all browsers.</code></pre>

According to Dan Primack at Fortune, Mike Arrington has been fired by AOL. My inbox is full of emails from journalists, friends and total strangers  all asking if I can explain whats going on. The vast majority of those correspondents are clearly hoping for a mass walk-out of writers if Mike is really gone. The Atlantic is already predicting what might happen post-walkout.<p>Meantime, Mike has gone to ground  presumably somewhere in his fortified Seattle compound  although with apparently as little idea as any of us what the final outcome will be. Primacks story says its a fait accompli, while others say the situation is still developing. I spoke to a senior staffer at TCHQ yesterday who told me No-one knows anything. Its bizarre. Surreal.<p>Rather than replying to a billion emails, or appearing on Bloomberg, or talking to PBS or Tweeting something threatening-but-ambiguous; heres my position. And its basically unchanged from where I was last week.<p>TechCrunch lives or dies on its editorial independence. Right now, that means TechCrunch  in the person of its founding editor  must be allowed to pick its next Editor In Chief. Arianna Huffington has made clear that she wants Mike gone and TechCrunch to be assimilated into Huffington Post, under her direct control. That means whoever she might pick as editor will be little more than an avatar for her; a cardboard cut-out installed to do her bidding. Thats so ridiculously unacceptable a situation that the idea makes me feel physically sick. It will be the death of TechCrunch and everything weve all worked for these past years.<p>Sure, the brand will live on  and as long as we keep writing about cool apps well probably still get amazing traffic. But traffic and a famous domain name is not why I  or most of the TechCrunch staff and editors Ive spoken to in the past few days  came to work here. As Fred Wilson wrote earlier today: TechCrunch also has a voice, a swagger, a fuck you attitude that comes from Mike They need to keep the remaining team, the voice, and that attitude if they want to remain at the top of the world of tech media. Damn fucking right.<p>Presumably, given how much TechCrunch and AOL both have riding on the success of next weeks Disrupt conference, an announcement as to TechCrunchs future leadership must be imminent. Im not going to speak for the other members of the team, but my own position is clear: unless Mike Arrington appoints his own successor, guaranteeing that TechCrunch retains its editorial independence, Im gone. Done. Out of the door.<p>Ceding control to the Huffington Post will be the death of everything  the voice, the swagger, the fuck you attitude  that makes TechCrunch great; and Im not going to stay around to watch that happen.<p>Four days."" - Paul Carr",1315511025

Schools have settled on standardized tests; the worst method, except all the others. And this is hardly unique to schools - consider the typical software job interview questions.

Perhaps the author of the grandparent comment acquiesces to children attending school more than being actively ""willing"" to have the children in school. In any event, the statement is correct that it is a parent's responsibility to protect minor children, and that includes protecting children from haughty teachers who are unwilling to allow parents to have the power to shop, the power to CHOOSE teachers as readily as parents choose grocers, physicians, community sports coaches, and other adults who influence children's lives.<p>AFTER EDIT: This addition to this comment was posted only after the back-and-forth below (to the ""great-grandchild"" comment level) about the unchanged original version of this comment above. Let me be clear: a lot of the zero-sum head-butting between teachers and parents would go away if only the system were changed so that parents of minor learners have greatly expanded choice in where their children go to school at public expense. Currently, the public policy position of most schoolteacher labor unions in most countries is that school attendance should be compulsory, that schooling should mostly be provided by government agencies, and that learners should be assigned to schools rather than have a wide choice of schools. All of those public policy positions entrench union leaders in political power, but none treat schoolteachers as professionals. Services that are CHOSEN by clients are largely appreciated by clients. Indeed, in the United States even a food stamp recipient doesn't tell off a grocer, because even shoppers who obtain a public subsidy for what they buy are still accorded the basic dignity of being able to choose where they take their business. Not all teachers are a good fit for all learners, no matter how fine the teacher (and no matter how dedicated the learner). It's best for everyone, and promotes more respect for teachers as professionals, to put learners at liberty to shop around for the learning situations that fit them best. The international examples I've read about (particularly the Netherlands) strongly suggest that teachers, learners, and taxpayers all benefit from having more rather than less choice.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Contrasting-Models-State-School-Comparative/dp/1441145621"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Contrasting-Models-State-School-Compar...</a>",1315510027

The majority of my warehouse staff's day is spent running inventory reports and checking product quality in the warehouse.  Our ERP system has only very primitive QC/QA support so our daily routine was a frustratingly slow paper based process.  Further, the system leaves absolutly no records by which one could measure productivity or success.  During those dark times we had to just guess what needed to be done next because we didn't know what was already completed, or what was left to be done.  So much slipped through the cracks...  The percentage of product returned or rejected by customers was embarrassing.<p>I don't remember where I picked this idea up, but I truly believe that management is an engineering job.  I was trying to engineer a high preformance process without any real data on how accurate our staff was, how quickly tasks were preformed...  We honestly knew nothing about what we had going on at any give time.  It was clear that nothing was going to improve unless we figured out how to assign and track our tasks, so I spent some time walking the process and created a list of what I needed from our ERP to effectively manage the QC operation. I forwarded the list to our ERP Vendor and asked for an estimate.  The estimate was staggeringly high and implementation would take months.<p>Instead I built it myself.  It took half a day to come up with a 70% solution, learning php and sql as I went. The system I came up with was a hacked together hodgepodge of php, sql, and a tiny bit of python running on a ubuntu LAMP server. Basically, I built an internal web-based quality control task system.  I works like a big shared todo list, where the system divides the work, assigns each employee one task at a time, gives the employee the information they need to do the task, and records the information gathered by the employee.<p>I bought my staff android tablets for about $200 each and sent them into the warehouse.  Productivity skyrocketed.  I don't know exactly how much was being done prior to implementing the system, but we know it couldn't have been more than 50 quality checks a day per employee.  Now we are pushing 300.  Almost 6x improvement is insanely great. Importantly, my team also loves the system.  They have to do so much less walking around and searching for product because the location is right on the screen.  They don't have to go searching for a category managers when they find poor quality products, now they just tap a button and an email is sent for them. It doesn't hurt that they now have a clear grasp of what is expected of them.<p></sidenote)Oddly in my favor; Resistive touchscreen tablets are much cheaper, and in a 33 - 45 degree warehouse my staff preferred to leave their gloves on and use a stylus.  The iPad I tested first sits in a office drawer.</sidenote>.<p>I spent an hour here and there over the first few days cleaning up the code and by the end of the week I had a system that tracks everything the department does and completely eliminated all the process bottle necks I could identify.  I even added a few javascript touches to reduce the amount of typing.  Its not in anyway well coded... What's MVC?  But it is stable and works very well.  I haven't made any updates to the system in months, so it just sits in the corner quietly improving my life, and the company's bottom line.<p>TLDR: hacked up a task/todo system.  saved a lot of money.  made my staff, and boss very happy.",1315509847

Right now the only significant research breakthrough  I've seen is the work on formal analysis of programs.<p>I have read hundreds of computer science papers from the 60s, 70s and 80s as part of my academic work, and frankly, everything I'm seeing today was conceptualized and/or invented then.

Somewhere in the late 80s things just peter out.<p>I strongly suspect a few things have come into play here.<p>* Disdain for formal mathematics by software writers. Mathematics is so absolutely key to heavy-duty breakthroughs in computer science.<p>* Increasing percentages of academics who never worked in the real world (and consequently knew how to get stuff done or what really matters).<p>* Lack of the academic industrial research labs such (Hi MS Labs! You are awesome! Keep it up please!). Also, lack of massive DARPA/DoD/DoE & NASA funding.<p>* The general decline of academic research quality, sacrificed on the altar of metrics (e.g., papers per year) & budget cuts.<p>* Friction caused by standards and legacy data & code.

If you are making yogurt, and you slightly deviate from the ideal recipe (leave the culture growing for too long?), you will probably get yogurt that tastes a little off.  If you are writing code, and you deviate slightly from the ideal program, you will probably get junk: compiler errors, massive performance hits, blatantly wrong GUIs....",1315508713

There are plenty of ways things could be changed in such a way that individual would make more money.

I don't think you'd then go out and get a $25 device to enable the whole setup, but then again, I am not you...<p>Still, in future versions I'd imagine the SoC would get upgraded appropriately and you'd quite likely get that. And run it off batteries with your roll-out OLED screen that you just stick to any old surface, whack in a nice set of headphones and you're set! Great for camping (hah!)",1315508633

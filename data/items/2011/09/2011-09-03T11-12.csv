2957109,comment,2956817,2957096,11,0,stdbrouw,,,"Aye. There's a sense in which being an inventor or an intellectual that pushes a culture forward is ""leadership"", but we have other words for that, we call those people visionaries or influential thinkers or a force in society and lots of other things too. Trying to appropriate the word ""leadership"" when there are so many other positive ways to describe the qualities of an independent thinker or maker is a bit silly.",1315050139

An individual is more likely to be a successful actor in sabotage and espionage, and harder to put trust on, than an established company. As this ""gig economy"" grows, I anticipate that freelancing individuals will to a greater and greater extent be approached with offers as well as deployed on purpose for this kind of work, as a form of incidental spy. That said, being a freelancer myself, I definitely see more than just the negative aspects of the freelancing revolution.",1315050037

Hell, I was worried NoSQL couldn't possibly work at all, given my experience of SQL and the joyful things that happen there.<p>But I've found that my object model has evolved to handle the ""scariness"" of the back end. If someone wants to change the boss of an employee, they are doing if via an http post. So I've got to check that the key I was sent over http is even an employee at all and not some javascript bug. Since I have to do that, I might as well read the data into my employee object. Then the code to update employee X with employee Y as a boss is pretty straight forward and thoroughly unit tested. The code to serialize an employee is thoroughly unit tested.<p>Not saying shit cant happen.

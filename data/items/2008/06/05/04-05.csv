209663,comment,208624,208853,0,0,cwp,,,"Not quite. If you're dispatching based on a sequence of opcodes, that's indirect threading. Direct threading uses a sequence of pointers to the opcode implementations, and jumps directly to them. Also, one of the key benefits of threaded interpreters is that each opcode implementation ends by decoding the next instruction and jumping to its implementation. This duplication of code gives the processor more context for branch prediction, and can lead to fewer pipeline stalls. With a switch statement, the decoding and branching all happens at the top of the loop.",1212640274

209659,comment,208917,208917,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I love those little intel boards. They actually have 1.33Ghz Celeron D cpus on them. The whole system with a hdd clocks in at about 48watts. About 8 watts while sleeping.<p>There is even a fanless version. Its nearly a complete working computer for $70. I often use a 4 gig CF card with an adapter instead of a hdd as well. One less power hungry moving part. They beat all but the fastest VIA mini-itx hands down at many 3x less the cost.<p>One sidenote. I had trouble getting Xorg/XFree86 to run accelerated at higher resolutions (than 1024x768) with this board. As of a month or two ago, they were still having driver issues. Windows XP worked like a champ.<p>Also their popularity has caught up with them. Everyone seems sold out lately. I've had trouble finding on the last few times I've looked",1212639435

209656,comment,209412,209412,0,0,ible,,,"I think Gladwell has a good point that trying to do a job is probably the best predictor of who will be good at it, and as a general principle moving that point up, via apprenticeships, internships, coop programs, and so on would probably be useful.<p>What troubles me is he seems to say that because people do a bad job of objectively identifying predictors of future success, that those predictors simply don't exist, or at least aren't strong enough to be useful. Did the ""exhaustive survey"" of law graduates he mentioned really find no correlations between something that could be measured before a career starts and eventual success at that career? Perhaps there are no good predictors in various fields, but I think I'd like to see some much stronger evidence before I buy that.",1212638780

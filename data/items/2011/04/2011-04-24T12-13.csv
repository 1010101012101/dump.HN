2478775,comment,2478532,2478532,6,0,bermanoid,,,"Here's the problem with the ""Let's just agree not to do this research!"" plan that everyone seems to suggest when they start thinking about existential risks: when we're sitting around in 2030 with a million times more computing power at our fingertips than we have today, constructing a workable AI just isn't going to be that difficult of an engineering problem.  We already know the equations that we'd need to use do general intelligence, it's just that they're not computable with finite computer power, so we'd have to do some approximations, and at present it's not realistic because the approximation schemes we know of would work too slowly.  Pump up our computer power a million times and these schemes start to become a lot more realistic, especially with some halfway decent pruning heuristics.<p>It's bad enough that (IMO) by 2040 or so, any reasonably smart asshole in his basement could probably do it on his laptop with access to only the reference materials available <i>today</i>; I have no idea how you avoid that risk by making some political agreement.  Hell, ban the research altogether on pain of death, and there's still going to be some terrorist team working on it somewhere (and that's even if all the governments actually stop work on it, which they won't).<p>The only positive way out of this is to go to great pains to figure out how to design safe (friendly) AI, and to do so while it's still too difficult for random-dude-with-a-botnet to achieve (and preferably we should do it before the governments of the world see it as feasible enough to throw military research dollars at).  We need to tackle the problem while it's still a difficult software problem, not a brute-force one that can be cracked by better hardware.",1303649308

An advocate for free software in all industries and all other parts of society. Why then, doesn't he play to the rules of society where it makes obvious sense? As much as I find his stubbornness personally sympathetic, I doubt he is doing the FSF a favor at this point.<p>As an example I know from the people at MIT Open Course Ware, that even though they share a very similar view on free information, and RMS can show great achievements, it was really hard to use RMS as an effective advocate for OCW.

2478755,comment,2478669,2478669,4,0,andrewcooke,,,"Your being worried about ORM reminds me that I felt similarly in your position, years ago.  Looking back, I think this may be partly a lack of experience with languages with memory management - you simply have to learn to let go.  But there is also a valid worry about flexibility and the degree to which you are losing the power of SQL.  To address that you need to think carefully about what you are doing and have some faith in the experience of others.  If you go with Django, and want to make a normal-ish web site, Django's ORM is fine.  In fact, it's surprisingly powerful for what it is.  But if you really want to be able to access SQL within your ORM then, at least for Python, you need to use SQLAlchemy.  The downside is that SQLAlchemy will complicate Django.  So I would suggest starting with Django alone, and really giving that a fair chance, and then, if necessary, looking at SQLAlchemy.",1303648182

Get it running locally then install the MySQLdb package for Python.<p>Note that in practice SQL is a small subset of the languages accepted by MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle et al. Each defines it's own custom dialect but the concepts are mostly universal.<p>At first I would use the 'mysql' command-line utility so you can see exactly what's going on; this comes bundled with the installer. Have a think about how your data would fit into rows and columns, but don't over-analyse too much - it takes practice to start thinking in a relational way.<p>Create your tables and insert some example data. Now in Python connect to your local instance and try querying for some rows (hint: DictCursor is useful, albeit wasteful if you care about performance).<p>Now read about database normalization and transactions.

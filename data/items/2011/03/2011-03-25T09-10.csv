If you have the data on-premises, you have control over the physical hardware. There can be reasons to trust your local authorities to not simply seize it, or spy on it in name of your competitor, but not those of the remote country.

It's a grey area morally, but it's legal. violentacres is the mod of quite a few raunchy subreddits [1], and jailbait is one of the more kosher ones.  He works closely with the admins to keep illegal content out, and apparently has a fairly good working relationship with them. Hell, there's more illegal content on r/trees than any of his subreddits.<p>Reddit's made it pretty clear that they don't intend to censor legal discourse, although it is their right to do so. Censoring r/jailbait might make some people, or even most people happy, but it's a slippery slope.  Once the admins start deciding which legal (non-spam) speech is and isn't allowed, it ceases to be a website whose content is dictated by the community.<p>Personally, I'd like to see <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/niggers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/niggers</a> gone, but I don't want the admins stepping in and deciding what is and isn't acceptable.  Short of illegal content, they leave it to the mods to decide what they want in their respective subreddits.

Mobile/social technology is coming to play the role in our society that television played in the second half of the 20th century. (Interestingly, the best TV has become quite a bit smarter and deeper, largely because of the same underlying technological developments.)",1301044960

Instead of mobile touchscreen devices replicating desktop gestures, websites will move towards designs more suitable for the new dominant platforms. OnSwipe is a case in point.<p>The kite metaphor is interesting though. If this multimouse idea doesn't fly (pun?), you could turn it into a kite wars game. Use proximity sensors (it's the in thing) to pick up fights with people near you. Sharing photos with strangers is not for me, but I will pick up a good kite fight challenge any time.<p>Good luck!",1301044200

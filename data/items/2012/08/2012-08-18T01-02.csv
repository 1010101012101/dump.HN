4399883,comment,4398979,4398979,41,0,hncommenter13,,,"There appears to be quite a bit of confusion as to what happened here.  The TechCrunch article doesn't really provide enough detail, saying only that the staff was fired in order to ""reduce the companys liability"" which doesn't really make sense.<p>I am not a lawyer, but as an investor I have seen this happen before.  My guess (no connection to the company, wasn't aware of them prior to today) is that in lieu of filing for bankruptcy, they did an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors.<p>But what may have happened is:
1. OnLive recognizes that they're essentially bankrupt.  Directors and managers now have a fiduciary duty to maximize the recovery for creditors, not for shareholders.<p>2. Instead of going through a formal bankruptcy process, the company does an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors (see a good explanation here [1]).  Any price paid for the assets by a buyer above what is owed to the creditors goes to satisfy the liquidation preferences, though it's unlikely there will be much if any recovery of value above the debts owed to the creditors.  The value of the common equity is totally wiped out (both common stock and employee options) as the total value of the assets is well below the amount due creditors + the liquidation preferences.<p>3. A buyer for the assets (the source of money with which to pay off the creditors who now own the assets of the defunct company) forms a new company, call it OnLive Asset Acquisition Corp.<p>4. OnLive Asset Acquisition Corp purchases the assets (not the stock) of the defunct corporation now owned by creditors.  The new acquirer buys the assets so as to avoid any existing/potential liabilities of the defunct corporation from whom it purchases the assets.  Imagine there's a company whose only asset is a rack of servers that you wish to purchase.  To gain ownership of the servers, you could buy all the shares of the company or you could just buy the servers as an asset with no encumbrances.  You would likely do the latter, as buying the stock comes with potential liabilities for past/future money owed or lawsuits.  That's likely what happened here, but for IP, etc.<p>5. The original employer OnLive is no longer operating.  The employees are all terminated, as their employer is gone and its operating assets are owned by a new company.  The new company may or may not seek to hire some or all of the employees of the defunct company.<p>6. Even if employees had been able to exercise their options, they were virtually certain to be worthless.  There is no way the price paid by the new owner for the assets of the dead company would exceed the debts + liquidation preferences (otherwise the directors wouldn't have liquidated it).  Had the employees exercised their options, any cash they paid to do so would have gone to the creditors to satisfy the company's debts and they would have received zero in proceeds.<p>It's a sad story for the employees, but there are rarely any happy outcomes for a company in bankruptcy.<p>Again, I'm purely speculating on what happened.  But based on the facts disclosed so far, it's not clear that one can conclude that the employees received a specific and unusual screwing by management vs. a typical screwing associated with the liquidation of a bankrupt employer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2008/03/articles/the-financially-troubled-compa/assignments-for-the-benefit-of-creditors-simple-as-abc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2008/03/articles/the-financiall...</a>",1345254976

Perhaps this is by design, the point being that the comment should be more important than the commenter, but it has its downsides.<p>It's easy to act viciously when you're only identified by a username, and this lack of identification, I think, breeds contempt. Though it's possible to dig deeper and find out more about each commenter, while skimming comments on an article, I don't ""see"" a collection of accomplished human beings having a conversation. At a glance, I don't know whether I'm talking to a bunch of snarky twelve year-old know-it-alls or founders with a wealth of real-world experience. To me, this matters.<p>I wonder whether there are simple ways to shift the tone of the HN community - for example, by assigning a short byline to each username that gives an indication as to who the user actually is, and why I should care about what they have to say (the ""about"" field already exists, but maybe it needs to be brought front-and-centre somehow).<p>Again, I've jumped into the HN community late, so perhaps I'm being a little naive.

4399857,comment,4387407,4389455,2,0,einhverfr,,,"By the way, the fundamental concern I have with SQL is the issue of ambiguity regarding NULLs.  We are taught that NULL means one of two things, but really it means one of three:<p><pre><code>    * Unknown value
    * Not applicable value
    * Value does not exist
</code></pre>
This is a big issue, because you would expect operators to treat these cases differently.  known || unknown is obviously unknown, but known || not_applicable should probably be known, and known || does_not_exist should be known.  In sane RDBMS's there is a possibility of magic values which provides a sane way to handle not_applicable (for example an empty string as distinct from NULL and yes I am calling into question the sanity of Oracle).  However, you still have the fact that the first and third cases are ambiguous although you hope not in any given query (the third case implies a missing value from an outer join), the ambiguity could in fact happen.<p>This is a fundamentally broken aspect of SQL.  The problem with ambiguity is that if your data is ambiguous mathematically, then it cannot be reliably transformed using math.",1345254232

Why in the world would you attack someone taking the time to answer your question?<p>Maybe you didn't quite understand saurik's response. There was nothing asshole about it. S/He conveyed three basic points:<p><pre><code>  1) There are well-regarded hashing algorithm that impose a limit on the input (bcrypt)
  2) In any case, the length-limit does not imply that passwords are stored in clear text
  3) An argument for why the length-limit might actually be a good thing (protecting the user from a false sense of security)
</code></pre>
Now, I happen to absolutely agree on points #1 and #2, but disagree with #3.<p>It is not true that passwords longer than the hash output are 'totally useless'. To find an arbitrary input which produces a specific hash requires 2^(bit-1) guesses on average. 'Attacking the hash' is simply not possible for a 256-bit hash. The only possible attack vector is to 'attack the password'. Therefore passwords longer than 32 chars are still useful.<p>A 12-character truly random password taken from the full character set would take the #2 super-computer on the planet approximately 8000 days to crack in 2011. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKNW5AUo-dM&t=43m50s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKNW5AUo-dM&t=43m50s</a><p>Add a couple more characters and you're into 'galactic years' to measure how long it would take. So clearly we don't need anywhere near 32 chars if the alphabet is large and symbols are picked at RANDOM.<p>But if you want any hope of being able to REMEMBER the password, then a better option may be trying to get equivalent entropy using a long pass-phrase; it could possibly require more than 32 characters to make it long and fun enough to be memorable.",1345253914

This doesn't mean you couldn't define some derivative that is ordered or that the relations might not be ordered in some way that is ignored by the relational math.<p>Suppose we have a relation R.  We may order this relation physically in order to help the computer retrieve data faster, clustering on an index for example.  However, clustering on an index does not mean that we are guaranteed to get the same order back when we do a select * from.... (we probably will but we aren't guaranteed to).  And if we add a join or other relational transformation, the order will probably not be the same.  In other words, ordering is outside the scope of relational math per se.<p>However that doesn't mean you can't have pre-ordered relations.  It just means the ordering is meaningless as far as the math goes.  The ordering may however be of great practical importance as the computer goes about grabbing the relevant tuples from the relation.<p>Similarly I don't see a reason why ordering can't happen after the relational math is done either, in this case for humans.<p>What this tells me is that the relational model is not entirely complete in itself in that ordering is an orthogonal consideration largely ignored which means there are certain questions you cannot answer directly with relational math (such select from R a relation L such that it includes the tuples with the five highest values of R(2) lower than 25.  I think that's mostly what you are getting at.

Not allowed?",,"So I've been reading that using long, human readable app names that include keywords will really help in App Store search rankings (at least outside the USA). For example, recently: http://www.slideshare.net/searchmanseo/how-to-improve-app-store-search-rankings-with-mobile-seofor-beginners-13822379<p>I've since followed this advice, changing my name from:<p>Version 0.1: ""ChillWith.me""<p>to:<p>Version 0.2: ""ChillWith.me - organise hangouts with your friends easily by suggesting & voting on the details of your hangout. Chill with me!""<p>This has proven to work, in the Aussie App Store at least. My app ranks 1st or on the first page for words like 'organise', 'hangout', 'hangouts'.<p>However with Version 0.3, without changing the name, the app got rejected for:<p><i>3.4: App names in iTunes Connect and as displayed on a device should be similar, so as not to cause confusion<p>It would be appropriate to change one or both names so they are more similar. And remember, it is not appropriate to use keywords in your app name; please use these words as search terms for your app by entering them in the Keywords field in iTunes Connect, Manage Your Applications.<p>For your information, the following words are considered keywords:<p>organise, hangouts, friends, easily, suggesting, voting, details</i><p>So is this practice outdated? Is Apple clamping down on this? I still see many other apps with long, keyword driven names? Any other tips? I guess I'll be changing the name back to ""ChillWith.me"" for now.<p>Thanks,
Jimmy

4399759,comment,4395014,4396051,1,0,ggggit,,,"I do understand about the simplicity of the design, though I haven't tried to figure out exactly how git works.<p>When I see people commenting about git's simplicity it is not about data structures.  It is about commands.  And that really tells me little about simplicity.  Anyone can manipulate the argument structure for a function and positional parameters in a command line interface.  The real question is what does the function do, and how does it accomplish it?<p>The first thing that struck me about git is the apparent use of SHA1 hashing as a basic foundation for the whole system.  Maybe that's not even true and no doubt there is much more to it.  I'm not out to become an expert in version control nor to understand git completely because I only use it out of necessity.  Older systems work just as well for my purposes.<p>I do not need many advanced features in version control; I'm using version control on a personal basis, not as a contributor to some highly dynamic project with many other contributors.  Plain old rcs is still my main tool when I need the ability to move between versions.  And diff still seems to work for detecting and printing differences after so many years.<p>But to me, as a user, the compilation process of any program is also part of any purported ""simplicity of design"".  Programs that compile easily and quickly and are easy to modify score very highly in my book.  I am constantly looking for more programs that fit this description.<p>I was not aware that there were many implementations of git.<p>I'll now be looking for some other implementations.

Bullshit. If a site blocks access to a particular news story for an aggregator, the aggregator will simply link to another site that has another article on that same news story (Breaking news? more like leaking news. It takes a grand total of about 2 min for someone else to write up the same story).<p>The whole point of staying on top of aggregators is that when readers follow a link from an aggregator, they will stick around and go deeper into the site - <i>thats</i> where money can be made. Instead, if they let the aggregators link to other sites, they just took another giant leap towards extinction.<p>John Gruber said it best - the way for newspapers to make money is to cut the bloat. <i>As opposed to the current model where the editorial staff makes up only a fraction of the total head count at major newspaper and magazine companies, they should become lean and mean organizations with little or no management bureaucracy. Operations where nearly every employee is working on producing actual content.</i>
Gruber cites the example of Talking Points Memo (which is profitable and hiring) and I wholeheartedly agree.<p>Welcome the aggregators to link to you. Keep your organisation wire tight. Those are the first 2 steps newspapers should be taking.<p>P.S. Reuters has the right idea - <a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/08/04/why-i-believe-in-the-link-economy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/08/04/why-i-believe-...</a>",1249829943

I said nothing like that.<p>Yes, they probably have an internal rulebook but that's completely irrelevant because they chose to not disclose it. They are free to make that choice, just like you are free to not do business with them on these terms. It's called ""Free Market"", wikipedia can tell you more.<p><i>A one-sided contract is no contract, consideration is to be given to both parties</i><p>I'm starting to think you have serious reading comprehension problems.
The contract is not one-sided. You get to read it and you must agree to it.<p><i>Developing an application is an investment and you should be allowed to inspect the full terms of the contract under which you make your investment.</i><p>You are not only allowed to inspect the full terms, you are <i>required</i> to inspect and agree to the full terms.<p>The full terms are: Apple may or may not accept your application and they are not obliged to tell you any reasons for their decision.<p>If you think apple ""should"" be operating differently then <i>don't do business with them</i>.<p>You seem to think there is some sort of godgiven right to get into the App store. There is not. It is Apple's personal playground. If they choose to accept apps only on mondays then they are free to do so. If they choose to reject apps because they would compete with their own products then they are free to do so. If they choose to reject apps without even telling you the reason then they are free to do so.<p>They have this freedom because <i>you</i>, the developer, checked that little ""I agree""-checkbox, remember?",1249829925

Over time you develop your own time-saving methods, such as pulling code out into reusable libraries you can use on your next project. Say you do a project that takes you 50 hours and you charge $5,000. If you get another similar project but this time you know it will only take 25 hours, are you going to charge $2,500 for it? Hell no! Charge as much as the market will bear, but set some kind of a minimum threshold for yourself.

750836,comment,749511,749842,0,0,dmhouse,,,"""Also: The Emacs mouse support is not great. It probably hasn't been a high priority.""<p>In what way? It's certainly as good as it is in any other editor, with the addition of several very Emacs-esque mouse-driven commands. For example, right click marks the region from point to the click point and saves it in the kill rin (like M-w); double right click kills that region. Using M- does the same, but modifies the secondary selection. Using C- with the mouse pops up several useful context menus. Try playing around with C-h k <mouse button> in various contexts.",1249829743

I don't recall there being a Caps Lock on that machine.<p>Of course, it's entirely possible that writing to the ROM was decoded separately and used for some control signals.  The Apple ][ I believe did some interesting address decoding to get control signals from the address bus.<p>Looking at the memory map for the MZ-700 it appears that it implemented bank switching so that the ROM could be paged in or out and replaced with the video RAM and I/O ports.  Some of those I/O ports are connected to the keyboard.<p><a href=""http://www.sharpmz.org/mz-700/coremain.htm#banksw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sharpmz.org/mz-700/coremain.htm#banksw</a>",1249829448

750832,comment,749511,749703,0,0,dmhouse,,,"Yes and no. When I first started off with Emacs, I used the CUA bindings (Windows-esque bindings for C-x/C-v/C-c). That was great to begin with, but inevitably a change of settings as big as CUA never quite sat right with the rest of Emacs, and prevented me from really moving on. After a while I declared cua-mode to be a crutch that was holding me back, disabled it, and I'm extremely glad I did.<p>More recently I've moved mostly away from the arrow-keys navigation (not just up/down/left/right instead of n/p/b/f but Home End instead of C-a, C-e; C-left, C-right instead of M-b, M-f; C-up, C-down instead of M-{, M-}; C-Home, C-End instead of M-< and M->, etc.) to the more central commands. This is less of a win but has nonetheless sped up my editing still further.",1249829269

It shows the company is light-hearted and paying attention to the community it operates in. I wouldn't call myself a 'rockstar' or 'ninja' but I'm very open to working with a company that doesn't take themselves so seriously. In fact I already do, and I love it. While my current company didn't use these terms in their job posting, I can easily see us doing so -- it's amusing!<p>I said in another thread on this subject a while back that, essentially, it's just another way to say ""Senior Software Developer"" or ""Experienced Ruby Programmer"" or whatever without implying age (or even actual years of experience... or worse, education level).<p>In short, let's not take these words <i>literally</i> when they're just meant to evoke a sense of the style of the company. Wanting a 'rockstar' just means they want someone passionate about their tools -- they probably use a Mac or other Unix, they switched to git from subversion, they spend most of their time in the shell. They are interested in discussing and debating what the best tool for the job is, the best approach to a problem, etc.<p>Put even shorter: The times, they are a changin'.",1249828984

Though I do agree with the other comments that xml is more readable if the structure is big, and that one can easily (and perhaps should) do both.<p>In practice I have noticed that where I work we tend to have complex data structures but not very deeply nested ones. We wrote a simple find function that recursively traverses the JSON structure looking for keys. Not anything nearly as powerful as XPath but sufficient.<p>It tends to be highly useful in my experience to create a list of objects. For example instead of a list of phone numbers a list of phone number objects. One may then easily add attributes to the phone number. Primary, cell phone, home phone etc. This tends to be highly flexible in that attributes may be later added that were not at all considered up front.<p>Of course all of this can be done with xml as well. JSON just <i>seems</i> more convenient. If I add an attribute in Javascript or Python I can just use it and get on with it. No messing with my SaxParser or building up some new XPath. Again I am not bashing xml at all, this is just my take.<p>In practice we use JSON exclusively in the core services for input and output. When we need to use xml we convert it to JSON and then back to XML as a filtering process rather than fool around with our core services. This adds overhead but keeps us flexible and loosely coupled.",1249826579

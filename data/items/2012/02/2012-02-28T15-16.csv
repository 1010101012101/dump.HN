The program is excellent and lots of doors are starting to open for our startup.<p>Basically we do some kind of consulting for small and medium sized business in Latin-America that has been enough to achieve ramen profitability, rent office, buy equipment and been selected to participate in the program.<p>We have two months here in Santiago and a month ago we received an email from Startup Chile STAFF saying that some small investors where wanting to talk with us.<p>We did the 3 pitch, I think we did it great because they asked for a second meeting, we talked about details there and at the end of the meeting  we scheduled a 3rd one for the next week.<p>This meeting was just yesterday and the investor said YES, lets start working.
We are a team of two guys, I do the technical stuff and my partner does the billing and taxes part... Thats great and is working but the problem is that I dont know how to code and we want to build an application for our startup.<p>The investor is the CEO of a web development company in Santiago and he wants to partner with us. The deal is to have3- 5% of our company in exchange of building the application and some cash for us.<p>Thats a good deal.<p>I have thinking about this app for a while and by this point I have a lot of sketches about how the app should look and work. I just need someone to develop and the investors team can do this without a doubt.<p>He wants this sketches but I suppose is not a very good idea to show them without any signed contracts. He just gave us a NDA to sign but I dont know what else we must do to avoid a story like this for us:<p>http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/27/a-classic-startup-horror-story-the-ma-bait-and-switch/2/<p>We have our next meeting on Thursday and Im really in a hurry for advice about how to avoid being screwed by this guys You know, I dont want them to see the sketches, build the app and said thanks for your cooperation guys, see you later.<p>Any advice about what steps we should follow to avoid a Horror story Situation?.",1330444757

You even managed to get his name wrong.<p>It is simply not true that the article is ""mostly in praise of his accomplishments,"" either. There is a brief description of LoseThos at the start and a vacuous upbeat sentence about workflows and usability near the end. In the middle sits an illustrated description of Mr. Davis's antics and a rather uninformative discussion about how mentally ill people are mentally ill. You cap it off with a quote from the DSM describing behavior similar to his, and reflect that you can ""understand and appreciate"" someone's illness now that you have blurb, even one which says nothing more than ""yeah, schizos do that sometimes.""<p>The article, aside from rubbernecking at a mentally ill man, has almost no actual content. It seems you were more interested in telling a ""tortured genius"" story. You insinuate that mental illness would be some sort of creative advantage if only society were more accommodating, that his mental illness and his writing an operating system are somehow two sides of the same coin.<p>He's been unemployed and stuck at home for 7 years. I don't think it so notable that a programmer in that situation might do some programming. LoseThos is neat, but let's be level headed. Writing a basic kernel (and this one doesn't even have virtual memory or preemptive multitasking) and a basic compiler are both common projects for CS undergrads. To produce this over 7 years isn't some unfathomable feat, though I can't imagine being sick and medicated made it any easier. I absolutely don't mean to be critical of him, and the treatment he received on Something Awful was really unappetizing. But it does seem that you're building his accomplishments up a little. And it seems that you're doing it because you want to write a moving story and parade his personal tragedy through the streets like some nerd Oprah.<p>This post is too long already, but I also want to say your blaming the community's lack of acceptance for the progression of diseases is ridiculous and trivializes mental illness. Smiling and nodding at his PRNG won't make him better. Finally, your stamping the article with a little self-aggrandizing blurb about yourself and a link to your github account leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",1330444729

3643551,comment,3639117,3639465,1,0,einhverfr,,,"There's a difference between ease of getting into business, and the ease of making a living doing it.  The debt economy ties people to jobs, particularly because of the fact that if you become self-employed, there will be a few years where you will likely not be able to cover your expenses and we have very little support for that.  So unless you are already financially independent, you need financial help from someone else.<p>A lot of the legislation is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the whole PPACA makes it easier perhaps to become self-employed because you can forego health insurance during the critical starting time, only to buy it if a real need arises or once one is making more money.  On the other hand, the mandate to buy it later, imposes an additional burden on top of things like high self-employment taxes.  On the whole I think PPACA does more harm than good because it can be very hard to predict when downturns will be sufficient to cause one to be able to cut health insurance out of one's budget.<p>Finally most of the ease of doing business factors are primarily about corporate business.  It doesn't tell you much about being self-employed.",1330444462

Suffice it to say that the only way we could get her covered without a ridiculous deductible and per-month cost was for me to get a full time job.  She works as the director of a local teen drop-in center and as an HR secretary as a sheet-metal plant, and of course, since those are part time jobs, neither offers any benefits whatsoever.

I knew I couldn't have been the first to suggest this idea.<p>Another idea I might add to my original thought would be people's fear of change. I would guess that goes back to before the days of agriculture, where you had to move with your food source. Any change could be dire to you tribe's survival. Change in food source means learning new land, hunting techniques, poisonous plants, etc.<p>So I think that anyone challenging authority is also challenging the status quo and is seen as one that wants to bring about change. The primitive (lizard) brain cares about two things: survival and reproduction. Change threatened survival in the past, and that fear is still with us, causing us to condemn the changers. People who are in a position to prevent social change (like, say, a psychologist) will do anything in their power to feed that fear of change because they <i>like</i> the way things are. ""Things right now are the way they are supposed to be,"" their lizard brain tells them.

The One-Tool-To-Rule-Them-All thinking ends up handicapping IDEs: something that would be simple to do via some other tool becomes a copy-paste-exec-copy-paste exercise in frustration.<p>* IDEs are generally too heavyweight.  IntelliJ, the best IDE in the history of all possible universes, grinds like hell opening up a significant project the first time, building up the caches that allow its refactoring and lightening fast find-usages to work.  And it demands a project file/project dir.  It's bad enough that I end up using TextMate (which I hate) simply because it gives me a browsable tree on the side and decent syntax highlighting whenever I just want to look around in a project.<p>I think there is a middle ground here: an IDE that is designed with an 80/20 mindset: no caches, no project files, no state, instant open.  Offer code completion (which shouldn't require a disk cache, just a parse), jump to definition (same) and then offer a find-usages that is really a grep-then-parse.  Not as fast as IntelliJ, but still better than just a grep.  And, addressing the first point above, very tight integration with the command line.<p>I think that's going to be my 40's project.",1330443938

In a quantum computer, a bit can be indeterminate.<p>If you have multiple bits, a classical computer is in one combination.  A quantum computer can be indeterminate between a set of states chosen out of the set of possible patterns.  Thus 250 qubits can be indeterminate between some subset of 2^250 possible states.<p>The downside is that when we input the start of the computer, we start in one state.  When we measure we see one state.  And quantum computing has to go by the logic of quantum computing.  For instance this means all logic has to be reversible.  Thus there is no ""if A or B then C"" because if you wind up at C you can't get back to your original state.<p>So for practical purposes a 250 qubit computer can start with 250 bits of data, ends up with 250 bits of data, and in the middle does an unbelievably parallel computation.",1330443270

There is a lot of value in a good IDE and that is why they exist. The article talks about plugins and I would argue that that is a strong point of the IDE, I know some of the UNIX editors have pluggable architectures but a whole lot more effort is going into IDE plugins. For someone in a commercial software shop this can be a good thing, because workflow can be optimized without having to tinker with ones environment there are a lot of people working on workflow type issues in the IDE's and this efficiency is being passed on to others. The trick is finding a good IDE and everyone has their opinions, I personally like Netbeans as it has the workflow that I like and it supports all of the languages that I use. I really think there is some dogma in the anti-IDE arguments and I  think it tries to unfairly biases people against good solutions. For some people the UNIX editors are right, for others IDE's are right, to call them dangerous is a little dubious in my opinion as it is rhetorical, the article makes some good arguments for using an editor, and I think it's defense should stand on those merits and not on building the perception that IDE's are a bad choice.",1330442801

3643374,comment,3642401,3642401,34,0,caidan,,,"My brother was studying for a degree in Sports Science in London a few years ago and asked me to come in to serve as a guinea pig for a project he was working on.  He tells me that all I'll have to do is ride a stationary bicycle in bursts of 30 seconds full out 1 minute rest, repeated three or four times.  I do basically no exercise, but this sounded like something I could handle and after all I have a filial responsibility.<p>So I think no problem, head down to his lab, and the first sign that something is going to be rough is that his friends are there (other students/guinea pigs) joking about how likely they are to throw up this time.   Apparently it's fairly common to throw up after doing the trial properly, but it just doesn't seem plausible.  After all, you are only cycling for a couple minutes.  Even for a lazy bastard like me, that seemed doable.<p>I sit there with growing concern as the guy before me finishes his run and staggers over to one of the tables and crawls upon it.  He lays there alternately going bright red and white and trembling like a fish too long out of water.  He doesn't speak, and doesn't respond when spoken to.<p>My turn comes and my brother, laughing, takes me over to the stationary cycle where he tells me it has been set to an incline calibrated against my weight/height to cause maximum stress during the all out segments.<p>I start peddling slowly until he shouts NOW in my ear and then I grab the handle bars and peddle for all I'm worth, elbows and knees flying everywhere.   Meanwhile my brother is shouting at me like a drill sergeant and through a combination of naivety and adrenaline I make it through my first 30 second sprint without too much difficulty.  At this point my legs are burning quite a bit and I'm bright red with exertion, but otherwise ok.  I coast for another 60 seconds and then the yelling starts again.  RIDE YOU BASTARD, RIDE!!!  I give it my best, but it's a bit harder this time, my legs haven't recuperated from the previous sprint and I am even more ungainly if possible.  Twice more we go through the cycle and by the last time my legs don't even seem to be responding to my brain, they feel hard liked they have been pumped full of oh I don't know, blood and acid, and have barely any power to them.  My final sprint is so uncoordinated that my brother has to lean on the cycle to stop it from flopping over.  Lance Armstrong's testicle was undoubtedly spinning in its grave. A group of my brothers friends cheer me on, however the guy who went before me is still absent.<p>Finally, I make the end of the sprint, and stagger off the bike.  My legs don't work, I feel like one of those floppy inflatable plastic guys they attach to a fan and use to promote used car lots, alternately staggering around stiff and floppy legged.  I don't feel too bad yet, and some sort of manic euphoria has hold of me.  You see, I tell my brother, some of us are just built out of tougher stuff.  He laughs in my face and tells me to go sit down in a corner.  I start to repeat my claims of being fine, but suddenly I feel like the earth has dropped away and I am in free fall.  He looks at me again and his smile fades and a look of concern comes into his eyes.  Seriously, go sit down.  Apparently, I have turned an unholy shade of green.  I stagger over to a corner, now feeling like I have reached terminal velocity and sort of flump to the floor.  Apparently my body is so full of lactic acid or what have you, that it is overwhelmed, and starts wondering if perhaps a good upchuck would help.  At this point my vision narrows to about the size of a penny, filled with dancing patterns and lights.  I don't throw up but I assume it's only because my body just can't get it together to do that.  I am vaguely aware of people standing over me, concerned, calling my name, but responding to them seems like an Everest of a task so I lay there in my flump, thinking to myself:  You see?  I was right, exercise is a terrible terrible thing.  Even 2 minutes is too much.  Never ever again.  I begin to vibrate softly as every muscle in my body twitches.<p>My brother leans down and puts his hand on my head and says: ""You'll be ok.  If you need to throw up, please use the bucket in the corner.  Sometimes people just throw up on themselves and it makes a mess.  And hey, at least now you know what it's like so it won't be so bad when you come back next week"".<p>I suppose he must have spotted the sort of mad murderous gleam that popped into my eye, because I doubt my mangled bleat of ""whaaabastardfuhnextweekafuhcrazy"" through nerveless lips was all that intelligible.  He laughed and said, ""yeah, I have to get two sample points, a week apart!  So you have to come back, didn't I mention that?""<p>I did go back in the end, but I sure as shit didn't pedal all out.  So I'm not sure if the body got better aerobics or insulin whatevers, but the brain, the brain learned its lesson.",1330441609

3643365,comment,3642106,3643056,10,0,pilom,,,"""Is there a 40 hour a week job out there that pays and furthers their career comparably?""<p>The defense industry in the US is like this. It is illegal for a company to have employees work more that 40 hours a week without overtime pay. The rationale is:<p>If Company A has a company culture of all employees working 60 hours a week and Company B has a corporate culture of working 40 hours a week, Company A could charge the government less for the same amount of work and thus would win more contracts. The government recognized this would create an customer incentive for companies to ""encourage"" their employees to work longer hours. So the government made a law that Defense contractor employees must be paid overtime for any hours more than 40 per week. And in my experience, no manager will pay overtime so most non-manager level people really don't work any more than that.",1330441432

3643362,comment,3642774,3643224,2,0,ericabiz,,,"Damn. I'm just really glad to know I'm not the only one.<p>One of my company's biggest sellers is a tool that does web scraping. And since we charge a monthly fee for it (I don't think most people realize that our server fees alone run nearly $2,000 a month for this, and that's with amazing deals on web hosting), we get a lot of ""Pfft--how hard could that <i>really</i> be to build?""<p>The answer is: It's easy--if you're only scraping one site, in small quantities. The minute you try to implement in Unicode (we have) or bundle it all in a report, or keep an ongoing cache of what your scraper found, or heck, scale it to millions of scrapes per month, all cached and indexed--now you are looking at something difficult.<p>We have a talented team, we're 16 months into this, and we've since seen competitors pop up all over the place. They all get a few customers and then run into scaling issues. It's one of those markets that seems seductively easy, but really isn't. And since there are many competitors lowballing, we've had to focus even more development time on awesome features to stay ahead of the curve.<p>I wish articles like this woke people up. Unfortunately, once you're committed and have a few customers, it's easy to rationalize going deeper. But web scraping can be a tricky industry to turn a profit in, especially if you are relying on a small and fickle customer base.",1330441386

An hourly-rate job is simply not attractive to me, because the hourly-rate will not effectively capture my value.<p>As explained by grellas above, overtime in the US is typically applied to replaceable workers who's hourly value is a more or less quantifiable resource. If I'm flipping burgers, painting a house, or banging out simple webapps based on someone else's design then it's fairly easy to quantify the value of my time.<p>However, if I'm working in an industry where force multipliers abound, for example software engineering, or any sufficiently advanced executive/management position, I would much rather capture the value of what I produce -- there simply cannot be a good fit with shoehorning me into an hourly value rate. It simply isn't an accurate way to represent my value.<p>This is best exemplified by jobs which supply equity stakes.

396990,comment,396695,396892,0,0,Retric,,,"To clarify people that where taking the high risk stuff got hit early when the economy was doing ""well"" but for the most part the ""AAA"" stuff could withstand a fair amount of foreclosures with little impact.  The crap nobody wanted was really high risk so banks kept it which is one of the reasons why Lemon Brothers failed.  Granted there was also a fair amount of crap rated like gold, but late 2007 to now we have been in a recession which kept feeding off of more and more people getting bitten as an ever increasing number of mortgages failed while nobody wanted to buy the property's.<p>Let's say a bank loans 300k on a house that was worth 200k  but got inflated to 300k in a bubble fine somebody takes a 100k hit when it fails but they are only down 33%.  However, if nobody is going to buy it for six months and by then it's only worth 150k and the spiral continues.<p>I also think the economy was fubar as early as 2005 with the fed using low interest rates to make everyone pretend that the economy was fine this was really helped by CDO's and people taking out risky mortgages.  Then there was a little bump in interest rates which finally set this ball rolling but it was obviously going to happen at some point.  Basically, when any little thing is going to upset the house of cards there is already a problem even if it looks ok.<p>PS: When the economy tanks it's a lot harder to prop up stupid companies so we are seeing a lot of things that where on their death beds for a while all fail but in the long term this is a good thing.",1229205111

396972,comment,396914,396914,0,0,gaius,,,"I think it's wrong to think of ""Italy"" as so homogenous, the North and the South have very different work cultures. In the North, private enterprise and entrepreneurship are prized, in the South people just want a 9-5 job working for the government. This pattern is repeated across Europe, in Belgium for example the Dutch-speakers in the North are very much more economically active than the French-speakers in the South. In the UK the pattern is reversed North vs South but it is still very evident.",1229203749

And since the government is guaranteeing income for insurance companies there are controls on how much money the insurance companies are allowed to make (from time to time they even have to send checks to their customers because they made to much money!).

396955,comment,396914,396914,0,0,ews,,,"I live and work in the Bay Area. Coming from Spain, where I was born and began my career in an US company, I have to say that the situation is <i>very</i> different that what is pictured here (and in the 'Joy of vivre' entry): Spain and other southereuropean or Mediterranean countries have a big combination of emotions and impulses that make them think they are not productive enough. To solve this, they apply a patch consisting or working more hours (in Madrid, people usually work 9-7 the least (and surprisingly at bigger companies such Google and Yahoo! it could be even more)) without understanding that working more is not working better or more productive. Being alienated with this working hors, most Spaniards rely on playing solitaries or youtubing on their terminals until the time to leave the office, feeding the vicious cycle all over again.<p>The managers in Spain don't trust their employees. Knowing this, employees optimize their time to do the least possible for not being fired.<p>In my experience, I have a far better life working in San Francisco. I usually go to work at 12-1pm, come back around 6 or seven and hack some hours in the late evening/early morning. I work at least once per day (usually two) and have as many vacations day as I had in Spain (actually some more days) with the possibility of non paid vacations or working from Europe when I visit my family.<p>I have seen this with many other engineers expatriated from Europe and relocated into the Bay Area. Besides being with like minded individuals, in this city I am relaxed enough and know the company trusts me enough to keep me working way more motivated, at nearly the fullest of my capacity.",1229202531

396949,comment,394609,396860,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I'm not advocating peace at any cost. I do agree with you that sometimes it's necessary to fight wars, and I would personally take part in it if I thought that it was the right thing to do in a particular situation.<p>However, you are creating a false dichotomy between committing atrocities and losing the war. You say that historically all wars have come with atrocities and that's true. But there's a difference between observing this fact and claiming that these atrocities were necessary to win the war. The issue I take with your argument is that you make no difference between causality and correlation. And this difference is very important as it determines the extent of atrocities committed as well as the psychological results on both sides.<p>I do not think that Abu Ghraib was necessary for the US Army to prevail in Iraq. I do not think that Guantanamo was necessary to win the ""war against the terror"" (which hasn't been won anyway). Both events were extremely damaging to the cause. Guantanamo was much more damaging though, because Abu Ghraib was a violation of the Army's own rules and the people responsible for it have been brought to justice.<p>Guantanamo, on the other hand, was deemed necessary to win the war and it's one reason why the war has not been won and will possibly never be won, because people all over the world are asking the US, what are you fighting for? Freedom? Rule of law? And then they laugh without waiting for an answer and these are not (just) the evil people.<p>Things like free speech, democracy, etc, were not achieved by fighting any one war more ruthlessly than the enemy. They were the result of long social struggles, which to a large degree depended on ethical integrity for their success. You cannot create limitless contradictions between what you want to achieve and what you do to achieve it. It hurts your case and it poisons the culture of your own side so much that you're bound to lose the peace even if you win the war.",1229202069

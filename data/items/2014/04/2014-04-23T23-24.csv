7637686,comment,7637278,7637514,10,0,thinkpad20,,,"As to Haskell&#x27;s syntax, I think it&#x27;s really just as complicated as it needs to be to express the ideas Haskell embodies succinctly and precisely. It doesn&#x27;t have any <i>more</i> syntax than most other languages; it&#x27;s just a very <i>different</i> syntax than most non-functional languages. And this is precisely because the <i>semantics</i> of the language are also very different. Haskell, for example, is not block-structured, as nearly all imperative languages are. (It does simulate this with do-syntax, but this is only a simulation). I understand though - I find Clojure practically unreadable, and this has kept me away from it to a degree.<p>As to where Haskell fits: you&#x27;re correct, there are many other great languages out there. But I think Haskell is really unique in offering what it does. Clojure, Go, and Erlang are all great in their own regard, but none of them provides the degree of safety that Haskell does. For example, none of them enforce purity, and all three of them freely allow the use of `null` values (which is really quite surprising considering how many problems nulls cause). Clojure and Erlang avoid mutable state like Haskell does (though not to the same degree of rigor) but don&#x27;t provide the elegant solutions for simulating mutable state that Haskell does with its monads, which <i>almost</i> allow you to &quot;have your cake and eat it too&quot; with state. None of them encourage the degree of abstraction that you&#x27;ll find in Haskell. Also, at least according to the Computer Benchmark game, Haskell beats all three of them in terms of speed, as well. Haskell&#x27;s &quot;place&quot; is in generating highly robust code with good performance, and also works as a beautiful language for expressing certain mathematical concepts.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make Haskell a perfect language, but it absolutely has a lot to offer that other languages don&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s so much <i>different</i> than other languages, that at the very least it can change your perspective on a lot of things.",1398297007

7637553,comment,7633175,7636499,1,0,masswerk,,,"Hmm. JS was before Ruby and Python, so it couldn&#x27;t have screwed up something to be found there. (BTW: HyperTalk was also &quot;me&quot;.)<p>The very nature of &quot;this&quot; in JS is because of late binding, probably the most important feature of JS. Since references are evaluated late, the need arises to store the reference in a variable for use in a later call. Since these are first-class objects, no problem. The standard name for this used to be &quot;that&quot;.<p>My point was on the total ignorance regarding the language. Why would you want to call the variable &quot;self&quot;, overriding built-in semantics? Why not use &quot;window&quot; or &quot;document&quot; for a change? Obviously you would not want to do this, even, if their values could be restored by the use of another closure.<p>The praxis of naming this &quot;self&quot; is just an import from other languages, proving that the author in question didn&#x27;t care for the semantics of the language she/he uses. Would you do the same by a compiler directive in C, overwriting built-in semantics? Could this become a pattern? Probably not. Would you redefine &quot;/dev&quot; in a Unix shell for other than a hoax? Probably not.<p>(BTW: I do not see a need to down vote a comment that points out a feature in language semantics. With server-side scripts and web-workers the global object isn&#x27;t always the browser window. There is more and more need for this reference, while it becomes obfuscated by a pattern rather questionable. And I&#x27;m rather shocked to see this pattern having become quite popular. There isn&#x27;t even a handful of global system variables in JS, &quot;Math&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, and &quot;self&quot; are the only ones common to all platforms. How hard is it to respect these? There are even use cases for overwriting these, e.g. test, but then you&#x27;ve just rendered them useless, if you chose to overwrite them in your code.)<p>Edit: And in case you wouldn&#x27;t see a point a made here, think of code maintainability. Let&#x27;s suppose you&#x27;re reading some random lines of code. &quot;Math.sqrt&quot;, you would assume to know what this is. Provided, you&#x27;re in a browser, the same would apply to &quot;self.location&quot;. But, hey, you can&#x27;t be sure nowadays.",1398295095

Basically use your provisioning tool of choice to setup an instance like you would a local vm, deploy your code, then package that all up as an AMI.<p>When the server spins up there is some minor config that gets set depending on the zone it is in and we are off to the races.  Takes about 2 minutes to fully register with ELB and start serving traffic.<p>Each step you remove from a new instance to become &#x27;ready&#x27; decreases your load time and lets you run at higher margins so you arent stuck with a Cloudwatch alert of 30% cpu -> scale up because it takes 20 minutes for chef to config the server, git to deploy code, run whatever compilation of assets/configs, then finally register with ELB<p>Downside of course is you are always making AMIs to do a new push.<p>If you follow semver, you could add a small step to handle a pull of your latest .PATCH version so you are only creating AMIs for MAJOR.MINOR.  Or if you prefer only doing MAJOR ami creations<p>tldr: reduce # of steps a new instance has to take in order to start handling traffic = higher cloudwatch thresholds = more server utilization = cheaper bill and faster scaling!",1398294135

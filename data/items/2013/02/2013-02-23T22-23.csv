Because neither company has a delivery network nearly as sprawling as Donahoe's, they contract with the postal service to deliver the ""final mile"" of much of their cargo. For instance, more than 21 percent of all FedEx deliveries are dropped off by a postal carrier. Meanwhile, millions of postal-service letters hitch rides on FedEx flights every day, for which the company gets paid $1 billion a year. FedEx and UPS don't want the postal service to go out of business but to remain contained, out of the way  one reason many of the addresses on packages that pass through Medford are handwritten by mothers and grandfathers and eBay minimoguls, rather than printed by manufacturers and retailers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/print-this/post-office-business-trouble-0213?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esquire.com/print-this/post-office-business-troub...</a>",1361659910

5271818,comment,5271516,5271516,60,0,joshkaufman,,,"The only thing current bestseller lists measure is unit sales volume over a one week period. That's it.<p>I'm a full-time non-fiction author, and I work with a large publisher. ""Bestsellers,"" particularly NYT bestsellers, get huge amounts of display placement in retail distribution. If you make the list, you get additional in-store display and sell many more copies, so most publishers want you to do everything you can to make it happen.<p>If the author is (or wants to be) a speaker, hitting the list is even more appealing: it's a permanent high-value social signal that will increase demand for speaking engagements, as well as support a sizable fee increase.<p>Each weekly bestseller list has a fixed number of slots, and many authors are able and willing to buy their way onto the list. The lists don't want to be gamed, so they've developed countermeasures (like tracking national sales distribution), which really only creates demand for order laundering services like ResultSource. The number of authors willing to game the list makes it <i>much</i> harder to hit the list if you're not willing to use the same tactics.<p>Anti-gaming measures <i>increase</i> the demand for laundering services. If you run a big conference or company, want to give attendees/clients/employees a copy of the book, and you want to make sure your book orders count for the list, guess what: you need to hire a laundering service. If you don't, you probably won't hit the list. If you do, you probably will. (This isn't hypothetical: I've seen it happen many times, both for books that have hit the list, and those that haven't.)<p>The worst part about the whole game is that, if you intend to hit the list, it affects every decision you make about the book: topic, positioning, title, cover, and content. I think many non-fiction authors, in their efforts to make the list, end up making their books less useful.<p>That's why this topic hits home for me: I've made a conscious decision not to pursue the lists. Instead, I'm going to focus all of my attention on creating useful, valuable books that are interesting to read, then make sure the right readers know they exist. If one of my books hits the list eventually, that'll be nice, but it's not the point.<p>I know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but damn, the siren song of the NYT list is still strong. Every few weeks, I have to remind myself that bending over backwards to maximize sales over a one week period isn't the point.<p>It's working so far: my first book is more popular today than it was when it came out 2+ years ago. My second book comes out in June, and readers are already excited. I'm happy, satisfied with my career, and looking forward to continuing to write books.<p>Success as an author has absolutely nothing to do with bestseller lists.",1361659661

You appear to completely misunderstand the point.  I'm not talking about mathematical ideas that have been taken, used, programmed, and made available through libraries.  I'm talking about recognizing problems and techniques when they turn up unexpectedly, and in disguise.<p>Many, <i>many</i> times in my 30 years as a working programmer have I found elegant solutions to previously intractable problems, purely because I recognized some sort of weird mathematical structure lurking underneath.  It's my specialty to go into a situation where the domain experts have worked to solve a problem, sometimes for years, to have them explain the problem to me, and then to bring different insights and tools to bear on the problem.  I'm not necessarily more clever, or more capable, I just have a different toolbox.  And when the problem at hand is unusual, my toolbox is particularly powerful.<p>You said:<p><pre><code>    Somebody outside devops would consider pervasive use of sed, awk
    and other unix text processing utilities line noise.  Yet such a

    does it mean you are a bad programmer?  Not quite.
</code></pre>
Of course it doesn't.  Different programmers have different skill sets, and different experience.  Someone who doesn't know databases or web programming may be a wonderfully productive programmer in another area of specialization.<p>I have no idea what relevance this has to my comment.<p><pre><code>    The way I look at it, I would consider somebody good if he can read
    the documentation/theory etc and then come up solution to problems
    (read: can write programs). That way you know the guy can actually
    get some work done. It requires practice and time to get used to and
    comfortable to a new domain. That's natural friction you have to wear
    out. Regardless of whether its math, music, literature of whatever.
    Paying too much importance to factual stuff isn't of much use. What's
    more important is, can the person work his way out of the problem.

Perhaps.  My point is that people often dismiss mathematics as useless to programmers because they can't see how this lemma or that theorem can ever be relevant.  My point is that the methods of thought trained by the study of advanced mathematics has, in my experience and others', regularly led to deep insights in apparently unrelated problem domains.  This ability is not something you can ""just read up on.""  This isn't a case of reading documentation and/or existing theory - this is a case of seeing something as being a disguised example of something else.  I've lost count of the number of times I've recognized a matching problem, or a topological separation, or an abstract vector space, or a group acting on a metric space, and that recognition has subsequently led to a new solution.<p><pre><code>    I checked out your bio, I understand you do math for a living and are
    obviously a little defensive when some one underplays the importance
    of your area of expertise. But the fact of the matter is though math
    is relevant, the areas in which its relevant are largely either rare
    or are already solved and presented to most programmers as libraries
    and frameworks.  And if its not, simple analysis, a little reading and
    experimenting is sufficient to solve the problem at hand.
</code></pre>
Then, with respect, your experience appears to be limited, and your opinions parochial.<p><pre><code>    Your problem is not with programmers but with a term called abstraction.
    And fighting that is futile. The benefits vastly over weight any
    intellectual argument you can present against it.

This is just bizarre.  I'm a pure mathematician - how can you suggest my problem is with abstraction?  How can you possibly think I'm offering any argument against abstraction?",1361659073

Counterproductive was a poor choice of word, let me better elaborate my concern. I assume the use for this typeface is to present wireframes to the client, free of ""distracting lorem ipsum"". I think showing clients any web design that lacks a typographical direction is an omission of the majority of the design in most all scenarios [1] and not fit as a representation for the future of that design. My personal design philosophy for the web is to accommodate the other aspects of the design to the typography, not to fit the typography secondary to the balance created by the preexisting design.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://informationarchitects.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://informationarchitects.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-t...</a>",1361657066

I thought I would have a career and family, etc. I ended up a homemaker for two decades. I have read a helluva lot about feminism and all that over the years and thought long and hard about what went wrong with my life. I woke up this morning super cranky about feeling like I still need to choose between having a brain and a sexuality, between having a man and a fulfilling life. I strongly suspect that most men are uncomfortable with so called ""feminism"" because they fear that if women get lives of their own, no man (or they personally) will ever get laid again. Stupid, stipid, stupid. I have read at least one article by a man who was involved with a feminist. He and the other men would wind up in the kitchen, feeling bad about being male.<p>Besides, the t-shirt is a play on words for getting your penis enhanced. I have never met a man who wants to proudly display on his chest the announcement that his dick is too small and needs enhancing. It looks to me like the stupidest possible play on words they could have chosen for a male dominated field. It will no doubt die of its own stupidity, winning a Darwin award, without anyone needing to criticize it as ""sexist"". Having a sexuality is not ""sexist"". The sooner the shrieky so called pro feminists figure that out, the sooner we can work on real issues and stop freaking out about the normal, routine fact that ""sex sells"", thus sexual references are incredibly common. The real way to promote gender parity (which I am for, even though I role my eyes at ""female equality"") is to promote the idea that women are also entitled to enjoy sex and stop implying that if a man likes sex, he clearly is a disrespectful pig who should burn in hell.<p>Anyway, I have an errand to run.

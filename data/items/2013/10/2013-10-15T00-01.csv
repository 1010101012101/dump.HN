The idea is that a bunch of their customers have answered a ton of questions, in addition to the gene-chip data they have.  Then, they can also opt-in (it was a pretty high percentage that do) to answer additional questions as part of further study.  This would be a very valuable recruiting tool for clinical trials, as it could greatly reduce the lead time on recruitment by just offering customers within a certain distance of participating centers who are known to have or be susceptible to a disease or condition.  It&#x27;s not that the gene data is considered perfect, but that they also have a huge database of additional questionnaire type data that can be leveraged.",1381798765

6550749,comment,6548908,6548908,12,0,espeed,,,"John Ratey (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ratey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ratey</a>), the professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who wrote <i>Driven to Distration</i>, recently published a book called <i>Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113506"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-B...</a>).<p><i>Spark</i> details how high-intensity cardio (like sprints or interval training) put your brain chemicals in balance in part by generating BDNF (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_fact...</a>), which as Ratey describes, it&#x27;s like &quot;Miracle-gro&quot; for the brain.<p>Last year my stress levels were getting out of control from working too much. At the time I was running at least two miles every day so it&#x27;s not like I wasn&#x27;t exercising. But then one day I changed from running a couple miles to running 50-yard sprints, as fast and as hard as I could push myself. The first day I only ran four sprints, but I felt euphoric the rest of the day -- the best I had felt in years. So I tried it again a couple days later, and sure enough it worked again -- I felt amazing.<p>So then I had to find out why this worked -- why a few sprints were so much more effective than running several miles. I started Googling and eventually found Ratey&#x27;s book -- it explains the entire biochemical process of what&#x27;s going on and why sprinting works.<p>It&#x27;s an eye-opening read. Each chapter covers how high-intensity cardio affects things like stress, anxiety, depression, ADHD. I have ADHD but haven&#x27;t taken anything for it in years (since I was in college), and I can attest that sprints not only fixed by stress levels, but my ADHD symptoms were almost non existent.<p>Here&#x27;s a key point that Ratey makes throughout the book that completely changed my perspective on things -- he says that instead of thinking of exercise as something you should do to look good and build a healthy body, you should instead think of exercise as the key to building a healthy brain:\n&quot;We all know that exercise makes us feel better, but most of us have no idea why. We assume it’s because we’re burning off stress or reducing muscle tension or boosting endorphins, and we leave it at that. But the real reason we feel so good when we get our blood pumping is that it makes the brain function at its best&quot; (<a href=""http://www.sparkinglife.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkinglife.org</a>).<p>In the book&#x27;s introduction he goes on to say, &quot;Building muscles and conditioning the heart and lungs are essentially side effects. I often tell my patients that the point of exercise is to build and condition the brain.&quot;<p>In fact the brain exercise routine he recommends is similar to a weight workout routine, in that you have to push yourself hard one day, and then take a day off to let your brain recover, just like in weight training. Another key is when you sprint, always put everything you have into it. Run as fast and as hard as you can so you are constantly pushing your body and your brain past their limitations -- this is the key to growth.<p>Reposted from: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5323019"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5323019</a>",1381798718

Very bare-bones: you edit a textual config file and run it periodically from cron, and it gives you a (repeatedly updated) static HTML page with the contents of your feeds merged into chronological order. It doesn&#x27;t live in the cloud; if you run <i>rawdog</i> on a server at home that isn&#x27;t visible from the outside (as I do), then you have no way to read your aggregated feeds when you&#x27;re away from home.<p>But it&#x27;s simple, it works, and (with a tiny bit of CSS and Javascript tweakery in its templates) it presents things in exactly the way I want them, which no other RSS-reading tool I&#x27;ve seen does. (One page with everything inline, rather than a list of feeds that I have to select one by one: I want my feed aggregator to actually aggregate my feeds. This enables the simplest possible reading process[1]: start at the top and read or skim until reaching something you&#x27;ve seen already, then stop. The only nontrivial change I&#x27;ve made is adding little toggles to collapse and expand whole feeds or individual entries.)<p>[1] I should in good conscience admit that this breaks down in the presence of feeds whose timestamps are b0rked, which are unfortunately not that rare. This doesn&#x27;t in practice require a big deviation from the simple process in the previous paragraph.<p>And I <i>like</i> having it live on my local server, not in the cloud.

I&#x27;m <i>not</i> defending overzealous use of &#x27;home/business&#x27; seperation. And I&#x27;m <i>not</i> defending overselling backhaul<p>- - -<p>In your example, you use an rented apartment. This is a perfect example, a rented apartment is like the 20x20 MetroE line I described above, you can do whatever you want, you paid for the whole thing.<p>A timeshare is what your looking for -- a timeshare also a rented apartment (or house, ect), but you <i>dont</i> get all the time, you only get a piece of it (say &#x27;up to 1 month per year&#x27;). You get a significantly lower rate (in theory) on a timeshare, because you only get a part of a time.<p>Timeshares are cheaper than a full apartment lease. You got the cheaper rate because you agreed to the restrictions.<p>- - -<p>Even ownership doesn&#x27;t absolve you of these restrictions. For example, if you buy a condominium, you usually agree to the condo boards rules (many of which include things like &quot;no guests for more than 7 days&quot; or &quot;no commercial / industry / business / trade activity&quot;) <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-12-08/business/0212080039_1_board-members-scope-unit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-12-08/business/02120...</a><p>- - -<p>If you want me to name &#x27;other services or products that include these restrictions&#x27;, I can name a bunch :<p>- <i></i>Rental Cars<i></i> (mileage restriction, modification restriction)<p>- <i></i>Leased Cars<i></i> (mileage restriction, modification restriction)<p>- <i></i>Hotel Rooms<i></i> (limits on number of people present, not allowed to use it for commercial activities, ect)<p>- <i></i>Electricity<i></i> (limit to how much you can use at residential rates, if you exceed this, your price usually jumps.)<p>- <i></i>Commercial Libraries<i></i>, e.g. Universities (time limits on checked out books, if you exceed them, you pay late fees. Not allowed to re-lend-out books you&#x27;ve borrowed from the library. Not allowed to make copies of books you&#x27;ve borrowed from the library. Ect.)<p>- - -<p>EDIT : Full disclosure, I&#x27;m trying to start an new Internet Service Provider that isn&#x27;t evil, from scratch, using our own network. (Not re-selling DSL / Cable). It&#x27;s really <i>really</i> difficult.<p>I&#x27;m as pro-user pro-net-neutrality pro-open-internet anti-censorship pro-EFF as they come. But from a mathematical standpoint, the numbers don&#x27;t work out. There&#x27;s no way to cover expenses selling dedicated 50x50mbps uncapped, completely unrestricted internet connections for $30-60/month (unless your Google, and can subsidize the whole thing).<p>Normal home users are fine. People who just want burst fast speeds, but push some number less than 300-600GB total each month, no problem. I don&#x27;t care if your running some webcams / Minecraft servers / web servers / SSH / VPN / programming for your business / accepting orders / selling ETSY stuff / ect.<p>But &quot;power users&quot; who want to host small data centers on their $30/month residential plan, or are seeding terrabytes  of Torrent data each month, or are trying to resell that connection -- it can&#x27;t happen today. Your making your friends and neighbors pay more for your crazy high usage. You need to be on a business plan, and pay for dedicated internet.<p>Remember, 600GB is a huge amount of bandwidth for a home user. That&#x27;s enough to stream 25 days straight of tv-quality video (or 214 hours of HD Netflix)<p>I have no problem with heavy bandwidth users. But I do have a problem with heavy bandwidth users who insist they pay only the bare minimum rates because of their flawed interpretation of &#x27;network neutrality&#x27;.",1381797693

They compete to claim the &#x27;bounty&#x27; of the item based on how many wants it has. Additionally, our transaction platform is decoupled from the site listings... users need not go through our site to track a transaction using our platform and feedback tools. External transactions can be brought in (from forums, blogs, craigslist, whatever) for free.<p>This is my first startup (man, the hours!) and any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!<p>For tech: the site was built with Laravel 4 (my first project with Laravel).<p>Link: http://comicswap.com/",1381797668

It&#x27;s not something that you buy, and consume it, and then go out and buy more.<p>Instead, there&#x27;s an infrastructure that need to be built. That infrastructure has a certain capacity; at any given time, only so many bits per second can be flowing over it.<p>Now, most people don&#x27;t use all of their capacity at a continuous, constant rate. Rather, their usage is quite bursty. You use a lot of bandwidth for a short amount of time when loading a video, and then none while you&#x27;re watching it. Or you use lots of small bursts while surfing the web.<p>If they sold 100 Mbps (no one sells 100 MB/s) and guaranteed that to you, it would be astronomically expensive. But selling you service that gets 100 Mbps in bursts if people have average personal-use utilization patterns is perfectly possible.<p>Now, how exactly should they advertise that? That&#x27;s a tough question. If they were going to advertise the minimum guaranteed bandwidth, it would be laughably low (and of course, they could never really guarantee any minimum, since how much bandwidth you get for a given transfer depends not only on your connection, but the backbones in between and server&#x27;s connection; there is no way to guarantee any particular amount of bandwidth in any meaningful way). And you would almost always get more than that, so that would be a fairly meaningless number.<p>Perhaps they could advertise an aggregate average bandwidth? That would be pretty hard to define and test (what sample period are you measuring over? How do you know when a transfer has stalled due to congestion somewhere vs being finished?), and wouldn&#x27;t really give you much meaningful. Are you really going to go out an canvas your neighbors to determine if your neigbhorhood really is getting the promised average aggregate bandwidth?<p>The only really meaningful thing they can give you is what the actual maximimum bandwidth they will allow over your connection. That is a hard and fast number, and can be tested fairly easily. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t say much about your bandwidth accessing any particular site, but there&#x27;s nothing you can really do about that without control of the entire network.<p>Now, actually in practice, it appears that when I buy a certain level from Comcast, they don&#x27;t actually use that as a hard maximum. I&#x27;ve seen bursts that were higher than the advertised bandwidth; and of course, I&#x27;ve seen transfers that were lower.<p>I know that everyone likes to criticize ISPs, and there is definitely some behavior that I find odious (blocking particular protocols, attempts to subvert net-neutrality). But over-selling bandwidth is not one of them. I can&#x27;t really imagine a system that would work better than over-selling bandwidth.",1381796750

6550564,comment,6550251,6550480,3,0,larubbio,,,"for #1 I was wondering if you could build a messaging system where the sending system didn&#x27;t know the location of the recipient.  It also would mask the connection between sender and recipient.  Basically you would send a message to a key to several servers in the network.  Each server would look at the key, and if it matched their address they would store the message.  They would also forward the message along so an outside observer wouldn&#x27;t know that that server held that inbox.  Basically 10 messages would come in and the same 10 would come out and maybe one would be stored, but you couldn&#x27;t tell that.  You would have to age out the messages, and I&#x27;m not sure if you could guarantee delivery.  By observing the network you could tell where messages were originating, but not where they were terminating.  That is the extent of the though I put into it, it&#x27;s fun to think about but I&#x27;m sure there are many holes in the idea.<p>for #3 the post runs the stories they publish past the government to make sure they do not publish anything that would be truly damaging.

By and large, though, I&#x27;ve observed that your post&#x27;s parent is correct - lousy home life, want to cheat, that sort of thing. Living in a hotel is dreadful (IMO, of course), having none of your own resources (I like playing guitar, woodworking, playing with my dogs, and so on, none of which are particularly possible in a hotel) is draining, and I don&#x27;t really like endless rounds of bars and restaurants. So, a terrible life from my point of view. The pluses - new cities, new people, etc., don&#x27;t compensate. I have a friend that travels all the time, and I&#x27;ll get plaintive emails about being in some hotel in some great city, such as Hong Kong, and he has been working 15 hour days and crashing in his hotel room, while his wife and kids and home and dog are half a planet away. I do not envy him.<p>To answer the OP: any kind of service/support role in the technical side can give you lots of travel. Install this new server, or help clients get up to speed, or debug this thingy onsite. But, be sure to figure out what this entails: are you working 5 hours and then carousing in NYC (the vision), or working 17 hour days in some dingy facility in the middle of Iowa? To make all that plane flight + hotel + expenses + salary pay off, it&#x27;s likely to lean towards the latter.<p>I made a joke that is no joke to my gf from my hotel room a few weeks ago: &quot;you know those bar/restaurant/hotel travel scenes in &#x27;House of Lies&#x27;?

Without intending to sound snippy myself, I think there is a tendency for academicians (whose promotion/tenure prospects are directly related being able to generate papers that get published in high impact journals) to be biased in favor of those things for which formal models can be created.  We saw that for example in the academic focus on formal proof of correctness of programs, which at this point is recognized as a blind alley, as opposed to a more engineering approach of using tools like valgrind and lint and static program analysis.   So I am a bit unpersuaded regarding the academic focus on forward secrecy.  It&#x27;s something that if we can add to a design, I&#x27;ll certainly do it --- and indeed there is a Yarrow-style &quot;catastrophic reseeding&quot; in the /dev/random design.<p>We have been moving away from using entropy estimators in /dev/random, actually.  We still use it for certain entropy sources, most notably for the keyboard and mouse inputs, where it is useful for filtering out event timings caused by the user leaning on the key and triggering autorepeat.   But these days we have a &quot;fast mix pool&quot; (which is per-CPU) where we sample on every single interrupt, and then down-mix from there to much larger entropy pool, and the bulk of the entropy, especially on servers, comes from the fast mix pool.<p>I tend to focus much more on engineering/social aspects; for example, the fundamental cause of the failure found by the Mining Your P&#x27;s and Q&#x27;s paper (as opposed to the hypothetical failures of things like the forward secrecy papers), was  people disabling the entropy collection in many/most device drivers because they thought it was too slow for high speed devices, in particular network devices.   They made arguments that it was because an adversary could monitor the packet arrival times on the Ethernet (which is not true in a switched fabric anyway, and if the attacker is sitting at Fort Meade, or even at AT&T&#x27;s data center, they won&#x27;t know about your local area network), but that was just an excuse; the main reason was engineers who were worried about performance.<p>So using a fancy &quot;approved by academics&quot; design which uses crypto hashing to mix entropy into the mixing pools may be pointless, if downstream kernel hackers disable the entropy collection &quot;because it&#x27;s too slow&quot;.   We now have something hard-wired into the main interrupt code path (it&#x27;s now no longer optional, so it can&#x27;t be configured on or off on an individual device driver basis), and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of work to make it be extremely fast, including using per-CPU pools, worrying about cache effects, etc.   These are concerns that I&#x27;m sure would never help a professor achieve tenure, but as a practicing engineer, I&#x27;ve been painfully aware about how important these sorts of concerns really are.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I do read the papers from those academics who try to analyze /dev/random, and I appreciate their attention.  But I do come from a someone different perspective than they do, and over the years I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s not wise to blindly take the advice of every single bug report that you get (and I consider papers to be simply formal bug reports :-) since sometimes you can&#x27;t satisfy every single user and every single bug report.",1381795609

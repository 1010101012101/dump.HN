Specifically, that unnatural trans-isomer fatty acids should never be consumed. Glutens, saponins, oligosaccharides etc are irritants; elaidic acid is basically toxic. Unfortunately, while some stable non-hydrogenated oils like palm oil have become popular, it seems that popular opinion at large generally forgot trans fats existed after 2009. They still exist and they&#x27;re still really bad for you. So don&#x27;t eat french fries, is what I&#x27;m saying. Or other deep-fried things from restaurants that haven&#x27;t eliminated hydrogenated oils from their cooking. In-N-Out is ahead of the curve on this.

6030823,comment,6025999,6029055,1,0,rlanday,,,"I think your explanations are largely incorrect. Im currently partway through reading The Bell Curve; it investigates a number of things people often attribute to socioeconomic status and tries to compare the effects of socioeconomic status and intelligence.<p>An IQ score is literally your score on an IQ test; I think its more correct to talk about g (general factor) which is the principal component of intelligence you get if you measure a group of people on a battery of tests, and is the most predictive way to summarize an individuals mental ability in a single number. A good IQ test is highly g-loaded, that is, it does a good job predicting someones scores on other tests that are g-loaded to some degree.<p>Intelligence, as with most traits, is influenced to some degree by genetics and to some degree by environments. This can  be (approximately) measured by comparing differences in intelligence between people of varying degrees of relatedness (somewhere between being identical twins and being randomly selected people), who grew up either in the same families or separated. Usually people are interested in pairs of siblings or identical twins where one was raised by families of different socioeconomic statuses. When The Bell Curve was written, the authors said the consensus was that intelligence is between 40%80% genetic, but I think its now thought to be on the high end of that. Intelligence is actually <i>more</i> influenced by genetics in adults than in children, which is the opposite of what youd expect if environment actually did have a large effect.<p>When you say you can study for an IQ test, I think this is kind of tautological; e.g., you could memorize the answers to the hard problems, but intelligence is largely stable through life. Its true that IQ scores have been rising for several decades (the Flynn effect), but I dont think its ever been explained really well (maybe fewer people growing up in damaging environments?), its not clear whether or not people are actually getting smarter or they were just scoring better for some reason, and I think theres evidence that the trend is starting to stall or maybe even decline since the mid 1990s.<p>Intelligence and socioeconomic status are certainly correlated, but I think it would actually be more correct to say socioeconomic status is a proxy for intelligence than the other way around. If intelligence is mostly genetic, with a small environmental factor, as it seems to be, and more intelligent people make more money on average, which they do, then socioeconomic status is certainly largely influenced by intelligence, and the heritability of intelligence at least partially explains why social mobility isnt higher than it is. Its probably the case that theres some intelligence benefit from environmental factors resulting from socioeconomic status, but you cant just try to throw out all the differences correlated with socioeconomic status, because theres certainly some (likely more) influence in the other direction.<p>If measured average test score differences exist between genetic groups of people (they do), these differences again have to be some amount genetic in origin and some amount environmental. The amounts for between-group variation are probably similar to the amounts for within-group variation, but there are reasons why they might not be exactly the same. People often claim the tests are biased; what you can do to rule this out is to look at individual questions that certain groups of people get wrong more often, since its more likely that individual items are biased than that every question is biased by exactly the same amount. You can also look at things the tests predict, and see if they have the same predictive power across groups. For example, if someone claims the SAT is biased against racial minorities, you can look at college students in different racial groups and their SAT scores and see if the students in different groups with different average test scores do better or worse in college classes (I dont know a good source off the top of my head, but to the best of my knowledge, the SAT is equally predictive across racial groups).<p>I strongly agree that the people claiming that psychometrics researchers have a racist agenda to prove white (or Asian?) superiority have a political agenda themselves, whereas the research in question seems to me pretty statistical, honest, and carried out without regard to the conclusions, and the researchers seem like they have to be very brave to carry out (or at least publicize) this research in the current political climate.",1373601208

My company paid a lot of money to buy it. There are plenty of things Adobe could have done that would have made it more valuable to us, and we would gladly have dropped the same money again to buy an upgrade that did a few of those things. But in several years, they haven&#x27;t managed to do any of them, and so we haven&#x27;t bought any of the most recent pre-CC versions.<p>The fact that Adobe&#x27;s Creative Suite revenue stream dried up in our case has nothing to do with buy vs. rent, it has to do with not adding anything of value to us in several years of development and therefore not being worth buying again. For exactly the same reason, plus the fact that we would never allow our data to effectively be held hostage, we aren&#x27;t subscribing to Creative Cloud, so Adobe will probably never get any more money from us for that product line.<p>PC vs. web is only a proxy for buy vs. rent if the purchase really was a one-off. For almost every piece of commercial software I use, that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be the case, and in fact the developers could <i>easily</i> add enough value that I&#x27;d pay them more money for an upgrade. The fact that they are pushing for the subscription model instead, even while doing funny maths that assumes I would have upgraded regularly to try and justify the cost, just demonstrates to me that they aren&#x27;t actually confident that they know how to add that value and keep me paying them.<p><i>And, like it or not, the &quot;buy&quot; option is slowly being driven from the market.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really accept that premise, either. Companies like Microsoft and Adobe have held near-unassailable leads in large and lucrative software markets for years. Of course they can abuse that position for a while to price gouge those who, rightly or wrongly, feel that they absolutely must have the latest versions of things to be able to work properly. It&#x27;s even worthwhile for the software companies to offer the first hit for free, but in the end, what they&#x27;re doing still isn&#x27;t in the best interests of their customers.

The reliability, robustness and the uniformity.  Maybe BSD UNIX is not as &quot;fun&quot; as MS and Apple, but it _works_ the best.  Relatively minimal bloat.  And things can be removed relatively easily.  Getting small is not frowned upon or ignored as a worthy objective.  &quot;The hero is the negative coder.&quot;  (credit: Doug McIlroy, one of the original UNIX developers)<p>Linux OTOH (a horde of wannabe kernel hackers and a gazillion idiosyncratic GNU programs) has brought the chaos of the PC[1] to the idea of &quot;UNIX&quot;.  There is bloat and endless tweaking around every corner.  The vigilance and skill it takes to make your Linux small and simple and actually keep it that way is, IME, quite the burden.  The respect for the user also differs.  Man pages?  I guess the assumption is we&#x27;ll just read the code when we have a question.  But then there&#x27;s also an expectation we&#x27;ll use binary packages.  Linux just makes my head spin.  I&#x27;m just not smart enough to use it.  I wish I was... because they have better hardware support.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve seen, I doubt many a Linux developer would think &quot;The hero is the negative coder.&quot;  Linux just keeps growing and becoming more complex and unwieldy.  And so by comparison, IMO, Linux less embodies the idea of UNIX than BSD.<p>1.

2096,comment,2079,2079,0,0,danielha,,,"I don't want to be pre-Matrix Neo.<p>Actually, the last company I interned with was a very nice place to work. The atmosphere was casual, the people were great, and I found lots of interesting things to work on. <p>Some people fear that a life comparable to Dilbert's awaits them if they get on the corporate track. Others, including me, realize that one can be creative and successful in the corporate world.<p>But that's not for me. Nothing compares to building and actualizing my own vision. I mentioned my internship earlier -- it was a great experience, but I realized that this wasn't for me. My co-founder feels very similarly and it was from this mindset that our best ideas came about.<p>Founding a company has always been one of my most consistent aspirations and there's never been a better time to go for it. And my final reason: it's fun as hell.",1172975985

2094,comment,2055,2055,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I read Buxfer's review on TechCrunch earlier today; congratulations to YC and the founders on getting featured there! :) The site looks great but they have some tough challenges ahead since Buxfer is coming late in this market.<p>The key is to resist the temptation of copying features off their larger competitor (Wesabe) and build something different. I think a great lesson we have all learned from Reddit is that a startup can survive in the face of tough competition merely by filling the gaps left by their larger competitor. So far Buxfer seems to have done a great job at it :)<p>- Jawad Shuaib",1172975851

4707217,comment,4706753,4706992,27,0,kens,,,"Hi, the author here. I'm using voltage sag to describe how the voltage drops as the load increases. (This has nothing to do with the presence of a battery or not.) Chargers normally are designed to output a constant voltage until the charger hits maximum power. But with the iPhone charger, the voltage is 5.2 volts if there's no load, and steadily drops to 4.6 volts as the load increases. If a device is expecting 5 volts, this could cause problems. Also, charging times could increase since the voltage is lower.<p>Generally, if the voltage drops under load like this, it's a sign of a poorly designed charger that doesn't regulate well. But since Apple's charger appears otherwise well-designed, it's a bit of a puzzle. One possibility is that maybe the exact voltage input to the iPhone doesn't matter, and the designers knowing this didn't care about the voltage sag. Another possibility is for some unknown reason they deliberately designed the charger this way.",1351371499

In fact, I think we're underpaid, when you consider that the top technology companies earn several hundred thousand dollars (and sometimes, low millions) per employee, averaged across <i>all</i> employees.<p>I actually think we're underpaid, and that's a problem, because if an engineer only costs $100-200k, then executives can cost-justify using programmer time on a lot of stupid shit that doesn't add any value (the hits, the projects that deliver $1 million per person per year in value, make up for it). The fact that software adds so much value (on average) should give us a huge risk allowance (that startups have visibly capitalized on) but it's only people with VC connections and executive douches, for the most part, who can actually take that risk.<p>It's not even about money, from my perspective. Engineer salaries are low compared to the value we add, but reasonable for the most part (we don't starve). What bothers me is that 90% of software engineers have to do stupid stuff with minimal autonomy or career growth, and I think that engineers (as a class) would be better treated if they were more expensive.

4707144,comment,4705299,4705545,5,0,koeselitz,,,"Well, I'm happy to respond, I guess.<p>A few years ago, I was given an iPad 1 by the company I work for as a x-mas bonus. It took me a little while, but over time I've found it taking up so very many functions in my life, and doing so with more ease than I thought possible.<p>To start with, I use a stylus (a Pogo Sketch Pro) constantly with my iPad. I journal daily - I now have about 300 pages of hand-written journaling done, two years worth, that I did in the Penultimate app. I also do a lot of reading on my iPad; I generally read PDFs inside Goodreader, which allows me to underline and take notes with my stylus; last month I read almost all of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, and now I'm working on Moby-Dick (an old favorite of mine.) Being able to take notes, save those notes, print out or email a single page - these things are very useful.<p>In fact, I use my iPad to fill in every form I find myself having to fill in. These days, lots of places (the DMV, insurance companies, etc) will send you a link to a PDF and ask you to fill it in - which, of course, seems utterly ridiculous in this era. But that's no problem for me; in fact, I prefer it, because I can fill it in pretty easily on my iPad (by hand with my stylus, or typing the data in if I want it to look pretty) and then print it out. That way, I can keep a copy of every form that I am forced to fill in. I do this with leases, with insurance cards, with applications for things, etc. It's a great way to keep track of those things when I find I need them later, too (since that seems to happen often.)<p>Just in general, it's allowed me to simplify my life immensely. Huge stacks of paper and file folders filled with old receipts and crumpled-up forms have been replaced by a tiny device with a few Goodreader folders. And of course, I'm the type of (ADD) person who is benefited immensely just by having a calendar app handy all the time.<p>Another thing - I am a jazz pianist. My iPad has become pretty much indispensable for my music. Most jazz musicians lug around three phone books' worth of music books called ""Real books;"" I have all three of the standard volumes in PDFs on my iPad, and several other more obscure ones too. I have hundreds of pages of other sheet music that's instantly accessible, no filing necessary. I can take notes on anything I like - my iPad saves all of it.<p>Also - lots of musicians like me find it really useful to practice along to a prerecorded background at home; once upon a time people used pre-recorded tapes, and in the past few years there's been a desktop program called ""Band In A Box."" Last I checked, a Band In A Box license costs $300; that's how it often is with these niche pieces of software. But there's a fantastic little $8 iPad app called ""iReal B"" that does everything Band In A Box does, and more - it gives you simple chord sheets for 1200 songs, and easily plays backgrounds for you if you need it. And in addition, I have apps that help me format sheet music for people and transpose it for other instruments when I want other musicians to be able to play along with me.<p>My iPad is also a really good tool for actually <i>creating</i> music itself. There's a pretty fantastic sequencing / synthesizer app called Nano Studio that I use to create some electronic music (like this: <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/koeselitz/the-end-of-the-beginning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soundcloud.com/koeselitz/the-end-of-the-beginning</a>) just for fun. There are apps like Filtatron with filters and effects I can run sounds through if I want. And the iPad is good enough to work nicely for my own recordings of me playing my piano; the Soundcloud app lets me record directly and upload immediately if I want, or there's an app called Fourtrack that just acts as a simple four-track recorder if I want several parts in the recording.<p>The essential thing for me is that the iPad is <i>miniscule</i> when compared to all the things it's replaced. And at this point, I can pretty much do anything I need to on my iPad. I can download files and then open them in any app I want to; and I have players that work with any format under the sun no matter how obscure. There were days when having an iPad seemed to be limiting in that it was somewhat difficult to move files around and manipulate them, but as far as I can tell those days are mostly gone. It would be nice to have direct filesystem acccess - but I almost never miss it now.<p>Sorry this is so long, but you asked I guess. Really, there are things I never would have even thought to do if I hadn't had this device.",1351369682

4707137,comment,4706196,4706557,14,0,mercuryrising,,,"The idea behind incineration is that you have a piece of something that is capable of burning and burning it at a high enough temperature breaks all the molecules inside down into smaller pieces. Or, to put it slightly differently, if you have ever smelled burnt plastic, it smells really bad. If you burn plastic at a high enough temperature, it no longer smells bad. High temperature makes molecules break apart into smaller pieces, smaller pieces are generally better for the environment, and they usually don't smell as bad.<p>This sounds good, but you need a really high temperature. >1500F should do it. In my city, we incinerate some trash. People are too good at separating the trash though, so most of the stuff doesn't really burn. They need to use paper from the recycling to make sure the temperature is hot enough to actually incinerate the trash.<p>Now, we could let all the trash just sit there. Would this be better?<p>Trash that just sits there a) takes up space b) doesn't smell good and c) doesn't do anything for us.<p>a) is a big problem in some places in the world, but not so much in America. We're fine letting big piles of garbage sit there. Not our biggest concern.<p>b) is a more interesting one, garbage does not smell good. Why? It's decomposing. Decomposition puts off a lot of methane, bacteria come in and break the trash down into methane and a bunch of other molecules. Methane holds a lot more heat than Carbon Dioxide (in terms of the 'global warming potential' [1]). For every 25 tons of CO2 emitted, that is equivalent to 1 ton of methane over 100 years. Takeaway: methane is bad, CO2 is better than CH4. Also, because trash doesn't smell good you get the 'NIMBY' effect, so instead of placing the final destination of trash close to the producers, we now need to transport garbage far away so we don't see or smell it. This is bad, magic in society is almost always bad because you lose perspective on how [insert adjective] something is. I never realized how dirty the water was until I saw it, or how smelly the garbage was until I went to the dump. My garbage doesn't smell that bad, but everyone's garbage and months of decomposition will make it smell. If trash is far away, it's out of sight and out of mind, you don't realize how much of an impact people have with trash.<p>c) Garbage doesn't do anything for us, it's merely that - garbage. It's served it's life, it's over, it just sits now. Why not try to get something out of it? Why not kill two birds with one stone? We always need heat for something, and if we can burn trash and get heat, that would be better than burning natural gas and letting garbage rot. This idea has been applied in a number of places around the world, it's called District Heating. Hot water is routed into your house, rather than having a separate water heater (homes may still have one to heat the water up more) [2] And this also has a hidden advantage - people always make garbage, and people always need heat. The waste stream can now be a useful product in the society, and a 'closed loop' society is a little bit closer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating</a>",1351369604

4707112,comment,4706678,4706678,22,0,tomstokes,,,"Very interesting perspective into the shortcomings of our military system. The article is worth reading through, but in summary: The author suggests that our drawn-out, meandering wars are the result of a perverse incentive system among the higher ranks of the military. Leaders are not rewarded for successes or, perhaps more importantly, punished for their shortcomings and failures. Instead, they are given short, time-limited appointments in leadership roles, which changes the goal from military success to simply ensuring that nothing too bad happens on their watch. Likewise, these time-limited roles result in a diffusion of success, where everyone can claim that progress was at least partially due to some of their own actions.<p>Perhaps the most succinct explanation from the article:<p><pre><code>    But the Army continues to do too little to sort the average performers from the\n    outstanding ones. That has long-term consequences for the caliber of military\n    leaders. A recent survey by students at Harvards Kennedy School of Government\n    found that good young officers have left the military in large part because of\n    frustration with military bureaucracy and the sense that the armed forces do\n    not have a performance-oriented system for managing personnel.\n</code></pre>\nThe author proposes that the military should more frequently relieve poor performers from their positions until they find the person with the right personality and intelligence for the position.<p>I've never been involved in the military, but I feel as though this perverse incentive structure is common among many businesses as well. Most big companies I've worked with have a few obviously incompetent employees in leadership positions, but harbor an unwillingness to demote or fire them because they've ""earned"" their position through hard work and loyalty to the company. Taken to the extreme, this is the famous ""Peter Principle,"" which suggests that employees will continue to be promoted until they reach a position beyond their abilities, at which point they languish in mediocrity.

It's much easier to negotiate a higher salary when your contribution to the bottom line is direct and easily measurable. But that goes to my point of there being more things that go into salaries than supply/demand. Whether your contribution to the bottom line is direct or indirect shouldn't affect salaries, theoretically. In theory, people don't get paid what they're worth, their salary is set by market forces and supply/demand. But in practice that's not the case.",1351368674

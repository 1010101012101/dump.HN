7776490,comment,7774158,7776356,4,0,enraged_camel,,,"Thomas, you&#x27;re still stuck in the technical mindset. This is not a technical issue. Forget about the discrete log problem. The NSA can frisk you away tonight to Gitmo and torture you until you spill all your secrets.<p>Before you say I&#x27;m being dramatic, consider the fact that this is a government that extra-judiciously assassinates its own citizens and then shamelessly defends it. If you think your shiny protocols are secure, you may want to rethink your entire perspective. At the end of the day, humans can be compromised, which makes all systems designed and developed by humans inherently risky regardless of implementation detail or operation. Any time the NSA really wants to gain a piece of information, the discrete log problem is at best a short delay. A minor inconvenience. A drop in the bucket in terms of the resources needed to go around it, since solving it is not necessary if the system is poorly implemented or has other, undocumented vulnerabilities.<p>edit: downvotes are expected. This is a techie forum and techies don&#x27;t like it when someone points out that technology can&#x27;t solve every problem.",1400641167

7776487,comment,7773840,7776324,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Encapsulation isn&#x27;t just information hiding, though I guess that is how people usually grok it. The essence of an object is its identity, with identity you can own things like state, but then that state needs to be protected. In a pure system, this identity is problematic: all values are are identified simply by their structure, and state would be unheard of. We might try to fake it by providing identities manually (see immediate-mode UIs), but then you are just trying to build objects again anyways.<p>Do you have values that you can name and talk about independent of their structure or how you get a handle to them? Yep, those are objects. I think most languages that claim to have objects actually have objects, the bar is not high! What is more problematic are communities who claim not to have objects, like the entity component people, or the functional programming people who start passing around numeric/string based identifiers to &quot;solve expressiveness problems.&quot; But they are just in denial in that they have recreated objects.<p>Note that information hiding, what we more generally understand as encapsulation, is not even meaningful without objects. So if your values don&#x27;t have identity, it is only their structure that is important, and then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to hide that structure without chopping it off of the value itself!",1400641151

7776456,comment,7776282,7776282,14,0,nivla,,,"I use adsense and let me say sadly there isn&#x27;t a better alternative to it, its simply the best paying ad network out there. However it is also the only business related service that puts me into constant state of stress.<p>Here is my comment reposted from an early discussion regarding the adsense that got flagged off the frontpage[1]:<p>I am not sure about the claims made on the post but there was something else that caught my eye a while back. I registered for Adsense when starting a side-project. I tried my best to follow all the requirements such as only 3 block of ads per page, no self clicking even if the ad was relevant to you etc. Since it was relatively new, it din&#x27;t have much traffic. Then it started booming but it wasn&#x27;t predictable by any manner, one day it would get featured on Reddit and then the traffic dies down, the next week it will another wave because it got featured in some popular blog, so on. However, despite the traffic being not predictable, the percentage of invalid clicks judged by Google remained the same. i.e. say your account shows up the earnings as $1200 but the check gets issued to you for around $1175, next month if you made $1500, your check will be for $1468. The reason Google claimed for this difference was the final audit that looks for invalid clicks right before a check gets issued. I thought it was crazy that I could easily predict what I would be actually getting instead of what is shown to be earned, moreover my super ability to predict invalid clicks. So I decided to keep a log of the difference for ~ a year, and what do you know, the difference in final audit was almost always the same percentage despite huge variations in traffic. I am happy to post the log but I will be breaking one of the adsense rules of revealing your earnings and thus risk losing my account.\nAnyways I am not bothered by it anymore, I just learned to write off the difference as expense and/or consider it as &quot;protection money&quot; that needs to paid. Too bad there aren&#x27;t any good alternatives. Adsense is by far the best paying ad-network but if it had less shady tactics and better support I would have definitely put it on my recommendation list.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7667976"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7667976</a>",1400640546

7776413,comment,7773036,7775640,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The problem is that wireless is a shared medium. If you have a certain amount of spectrum, you can transfer a finite number of bits per second using it, and that capacity is shared between all devices in range. The bandwidth available in a certain chunk of spectrum is a physical limit. There is no way to expand capacity other than by allocating more spectrum, and radio spectrum is extremely scarce. So the more users you have using cellular for internet, the less bandwidth they each get.<p>The solution when you want to have &quot;wireless&quot; devices but there isn&#x27;t enough wireless spectrum is to use wireless for the &quot;last 50 meters&quot; rather than the last mile. In other words, you have fiber to the premises and then WiFi within the building. By keeping the wireless power levels as low as possible you reduce the number of other users you&#x27;re sharing the spectrum with and allow each user to have a satisfactory amount of bandwidth. Then reserve cellular wireless for users not in a building, e.g. accessing a map from your car, and have all manner of stupid bandwidth caps to discourage usage of cellular wireless whenever it isn&#x27;t strictly necessary.<p>> Is a mesh network an answer?<p>No. Mesh networks would allow you to have more bandwidth per user by reducing wireless power levels and shrinking the geographic size of the collision domain, but that would require peers to act as repeaters between other peers and the tower. That&#x27;s an epic fail. It adds latency, reduces battery life, impacts reliability if any peer&#x27;s device is flaky, has security implications, etc. Wireless mesh networks ironically work much better for fixed-position devices than mobile devices, because they can use directional antennas, don&#x27;t have the extreme power constraints mobile devices do, etc.",1400639429

On paper, many people in Marin are very wealthy, but in practice this isn&#x27;t as common as the stats suggest (An ex-girlfriend&#x27;s parents weren&#x27;t well off enough to help her attend college, but her parents were considered too rich due to their house for financial aid).<p>I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to have parents who could afford to help me with school, and have an interest in a lucrative field (computer science). However, many of my highschool classmates did not have one (or both) of those advantages. They are also squeezed between a high cost of living and the lack of jobs that provide a realistic living wage. However, unlike migrants from other areas, the less fortunate locals do not have another home to go back to. I know families that moved their entire family out of the state while their kids were still in school because it became financially untenable to live in the area.<p>This situation reminds me of the ongoing situation in SF. There are plenty of stories (anecdotal though they may be) of long-time residents being forced out of communities by the economic climate. It is easy for outsides to look at the Bay Area and see a city made up of tech workers making $100k+ a year, but the reality is very different. The same is true of people who bought their houses in a different economic climate. At least the parents have the &quot;escape value&quot; of their houses, as long as they&#x27;re willing to sell off 18+ years of their lives.",1400638627

7776353,comment,7774016,7775131,0,0,aaronem,,,"(In the following, we will stipulate that your &quot;rogue programmer disrupts Photoshop, resulting in a better product and getting half of Adobe fired&quot; situation is plausible, for the sake of illustration.)<p>The half of Adobe you posit getting sacked wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth it, though, and from a certain perspective -- namely, their own -- they&#x27;d be right.<p>After all, Photoshop is already the unquestioned leader in its field, and the closest competitor isn&#x27;t even within shouting distance, so what good does it really do Adobe&#x27;s business if Creative Cloud&#x27;s Photoshop component sucks 20% less?<p>(Yes, no one is happy with the change from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud; this I concede. But those who are unhappy with it aren&#x27;t decamping to the GIMP or some other laughable knockoff; instead, they are <i>buying CS6 licenses</i>, and they aren&#x27;t going to be convinced to replace those with Creative Cloud subscriptions by a mere 20% improvement in Photoshop.)<p>Meanwhile, there are a whole lot of people earning livings as part of Adobe Inc., who, in your &quot;rogue programmer disrupts everything&quot; scenario, suddenly won&#x27;t be.<p>This, for good and necessary reasons, makes every one of those people a political enemy of your rogue programmer; after all, whether he means to do so or not, the effect of his actions is to critically imperil those people&#x27;s ability to maintain themselves, their families, and the position in life to which all of same have grown accustomed.<p>(This might seem to you like a mild inconvenience. If so, I can only assume either that you&#x27;re not getting paid well, or that you&#x27;re only so recently getting paid well that you&#x27;ve yet to accustom yourself to it, and in either case that you&#x27;re also not carrying a meaningful amount of debt. Hell, <i>I&#x27;m</i> not paid all that well, and I carry less debt than anyone I know, and I can assure you that my recent layoff was nonetheless far more than a &quot;mild inconvenience&quot;.)<p>Getting back to our illustration: Of course, I&#x27;m sure our lovable rogue doesn&#x27;t intend to get all those people laid off; indeed, given his laserlike focus on the quality of the product for which he considers himself responsible and his evident and total innocence of matters political, it probably never even occurred to him that such a thing could happen. <i>This doesn&#x27;t matter at all.</i> Whether he intended it or not, he&#x27;s put a huge chunk of the corporation which employs him in danger of being laid off.<p>Expecting those people to react in any other way than by attempting to squash him, by whatever means prove necessary and lie within their grasp, would be foolish; when you threaten a man&#x27;s life, or something which a man regards as vital, i.e., essential to life, it is only basic sense to expect that he will react as strongly as is within his power. Speculate all you like on why this should be the case; regardless, it is a fact of human existence, and to regard it in any other frame of mind save acceptance is to waste your time and mental effort on utopian fantasy.<p>And half of a company the size of Adobe is a group of people with a very great deal of power, indeed. Even if we scale down from Adobe as a whole to just the Photoshop project team, at least some of those people are perforce going to be in the higher ranks of management. In fact, since our rogue is a Photoshop developer, at least some of those people are going to be in his direct line of command.<p>No points for guessing what happens to our lovable rogue when, through his innocence of the political realities of any large human organization, he places at risk the jobs of one or more of his direct superiors. Even if, by some impossible miracle, he manages not to lose his own job, then he&#x27;s certainly not long for the company, because among the people he&#x27;s managed to alienate are many of his peers. This means he&#x27;s got more people looking to put knives in his back than he could keep up with, even if he realized he needed to be looking over his shoulder.<p>Of course, our lovable rogue being not entirely without some sort of rudimentary sense of interpersonal relationships, even if he isn&#x27;t shuffled aside immediately and laid off as soon as practicable, he&#x27;ll realize that his only sensible option is to resign, because there is no longer any chance that he&#x27;ll be able to work productively with his erstwhile colleagues, who now consider him about as safe to be around as old dynamite that&#x27;s sweating nitroglycerin.<p>So our rogue will quit his job, lick his wounds, and find somewhere else to work, and odds are the lesson he&#x27;ll take from his error is, from the perspective of his future prospects and his ability to advance his career, the single worst one he could possibly choose: specifically, that office politics are incomprehensible, deadly, and evil, that anyone who engages in them is therefore necessarily an awful person and best avoided, as are office politics in general, because an honest hacker can&#x27;t understand the game well enough to play it, and it&#x27;ll only end in tears.<p>None of which, of course, is true. But all of it accords perfectly with the default attitude among software engineers toward office politics, and I&#x27;m starting to think that might have a lot to do with the way that the default position of software engineers, when it comes to dealing with management, is &quot;screwed&quot;.",1400637992

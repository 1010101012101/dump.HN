76680,comment,76604,76628,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It's a matter of trust. Each of these people has had thousands of red wines served to them, with none of them being an impostor white with food coloring. Therefore if a white is served to them in disguise, they simply assume it's a red, because why would anyone ever do that? <p>Also, whites are typically served chilled, reds aren't. If someone gave me a warm white wine with red food coloring in it I might not care for it but I'd definitely be fooled. That doesn't mean there isn't a difference.<p>A much better test would be to blindfold them and ask which are whites and which are red. I bet they'd do considerably better. ",1194374935

76669,comment,76425,76425,0,0,shayan,,,"In the news:
- Google has launched two major platforms within the past week
- Last week Google introduced OpenSocial for the web and yesterday their mobile platform Android<p>- Both platforms have the same approach: both open, easier for developers to make applications, developers will be able to reach a lot more potential users much easier and faster, Google is constantly looking to add new partners (major ones) that would also support these platforms.<p>From Before:
- In the 90's everything seemed to be closed and platforms were mostly used to set <i>standards</i> and create <i>lock-in</i> situations and exclude the competition (Microsoft was the pro here). --> the exact opposite of what Google is doing now!<p>- The web has changed many things and creating such lock-ins are not possible anymore, at least not the same way as before<p>We Know:
- Google's mission and business model requires them to have access to all the information on the web<p>- Facebook and other sites have proved that they can accumulate vital information and have them within their walled gardens, and exclude Google from accessing them<p>- Google knows they can't <i>own</i> all the information themselves or have exclusive access to them<p>- But they also know their strengths, if information is available to everyone they believe they are better in getting that information, so other companies will not be scaring Google by also having access to those info<p>Question:
- with the new platforms and the new approach, is Google simply making sure they'll continue to have access to all the information out there, OR are they in fact doing more behind the scenes that would allow them to take advantage of their platforms and set standards the way companies did in the 90's, will they be able to create lock-in situations again?",1194374180

Success for a startup could be defined in lots of ways, but I doubt that winning a media award would be one of them. Will the judges give preference to startups using Java or Sun kit? Can any startups afford to use Sun kit? What happens if one of the winners subsequently falls flat on its arse? I would bet that most YCers wouldn't give this award a second thought.",1194373871

But definitely don't try the whole shebang at once.<p>And I wouldn't look at it as work. More like nerd-traveling: you get to see a lot of neat and unusual things, and when you're done, you appreciate home a lot better and have a better perspective on things. Having said that, I'd be sure you solve a few non-trivial problems. Traveling is no fun if you just take pictures and don't get out and participate.<p>In general, if you haven't tried a new way of making solutions in the last five years or more, you're sucking wind in this biz. That's advice just about _keeping up_, getting ahead is an even tougher game.",1194372054

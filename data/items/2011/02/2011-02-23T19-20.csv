An app that determines when someone isn't home <i>or</i> when someone is alone in a dangerous area would still be undesirable.<p>Note also - Friend doesn't let someone explicit reject a friend request and it doesn't let people ""unlike"".

2255527,comment,2253897,2254734,0,0,fab13n,,,"I had to make some evolutions in an Eclipse plug-in which was written in Scala (the module wasn't intended to manipulate Scala code, it just happened to be the implementation language). I initially had a positive prejudice, as a OCaml enthusiast who used to get paid for developping in OCaml; moreover, as someone who's been exposed to languages with serious abtraction power, I easily get irritated by Java.<p>The code was a true pain in the ass to work with: integration with OSGi was cumbersome, lots of black magic features were used gratuitously, the possibility to define stuff-which-look-like-methods-yet-aren't-in-the-class made quite a mess of code exploration, and of course tooling support was abysmally bad.<p>I know the usual rebuttal: it's the bad developer's fault, not the language's. I don't buy this, a ""good"" language for which you can't find decent coders isn't any good.<p>- Scala-like languages tend to attract guys who will mess with all the quirky features of the language;<p>- In real life, developers are a given and the language is the adjustment variable, not the other way around. Most people don't have the luxury of only working with rockstars, and most of the cornerstones of the Internet haven't been developed by rockstars anyway.<p>- The average developer will do an average job of writing maintainable Java, and an awful job of writing acceptable Scala, if only because there's no widespread consensus ov what it means for Scala code to be acceptable. Java is dull and uneventful, and I'd rather take over a syntactically dull and uneventful code base than an ""interesting"" one.<p>- I've heared several times that ""you can use Scala as a Java with closures"". It's a variant of the argument that there's a 5 times smaller language hidden in C++ that's beautiful: nobody ever agreed over which 20% should be selected.<p>The two languages which gave me the impression of trying to support every feature ever invented, and of making it very difficult for people to acquire and share a notion of standard, maintainable code are C++ and Scala. An iconic counter-example would be Python.<p>More anecdotically, I spent a couple of days studying how Lift works, for personal curiosity. I found the code hard to navigate into. due to too many non-orthogonal ways of composing code together. A good tooling support would have helped, but if it doesn't exist after all those years, I might mean that there's something wrong with the language: it's not as if the need wasn't clearly perceived.",1298490977
2255526,comment,2255358,2255358,0,0,eitally,,,"He's completely wrong about the one pretty important detail: why businesses are fed up with their IT departments.  The reason isn't because of IT's unwillingness to adopt new technology (his Exchange-to-Gmail example), or that there isn't any ""feedback loop for improvement.""  IT departments were created and exist because external vendors haven't satisfied business needs adequately.  In small to medium sized businesses that's changing rapidly, but in large enterprises it's a glacial shift specifically due to what David doesn't get: IT is slow because businesses don't know what they want, they create overly complex specifications, they are slow to make decisions, and they often enforce draconian regulations.  There are an abundance of ways IT can perform better in the age of web, not the least of which is knowing when to strategically outsource NVA functions.  Sometimes these are obvious, like email, but a number of other core SG&A-type systems can be moved off-premise, too: HRIS, project management, helpdesk, and many more (there are even SAAS ERPs popping up).<p>As AngeloAnolin notes, this is forcing every IT staffer -- especially managers -- to be as close to the business as only CIOs have been.",1298490965

2255521,comment,2253897,2254298,0,0,abp,,,"First on Java generics: I don't understand all the complaints about generics anyway. They're very useful and not really hard to understand, basically. Besides the readability gain, you get compile time errors, or even hints in an ide for types that don't fit compared to casting from object to the type you expect to get. Also APIs are a lot more readable and expressive when you don't have a bunch of methods taking objects as parameters.<p><i>I think the ""subsetting the language"" approach is a red herring.</i><p>I don't think that the compatibility in syntax is meant for subsetting, but merely for approaching a language one step at a time. When you learn programming in a new language that has this advantage, you can start right away, using familiar concepts and learn more features as you need them. You can grow into the language.<p>At least that was my approach in learning languages like VB.Net(oh yeah..), C# and Java for example. The specific advantages of each language come in when i try to simplify things or do something in a better way.<p>Making the wall merely a ramp you can go up slowly instead of climbing right uphill.<p>Also I'm interested in the way some programmer could/should be able to learn a whole language in depth before getting his hands dirty on a real project, working in a company.",1298490914

2255491,comment,2255096,2255096,0,0,mindcrime,,,"As you might guess, the answer is ""it depends.""  I tend to read fiction cover to cover, and if it's short enough (the average Dean Koontz novel, for example) I often read it one sitting.  A Stephen King novel like <i>Under The Dome</i> might take 2-3 sittings.<p>Non-fiction is a different story.  I tend to read business books cover to cover (relative to a span of time, like say a week or two), but I interleave reading multiple books so that, at any given time, I have 3-4 books I'm in the middle of reading.  Which one I pick up to read a few pages of on any given evening when I have time to read just comes down to a whim.<p>Similar case with other non-fiction stuff... I have bookmarks stuffed in probably a couple of dozen books that are in some intermediate stage of being read.  But sometimes one just catches my fancy and I knock it out in a few days (or whatever time-frame, depending on the length and difficulty.)<p>The big exception are books that are basically just reference.  A tutorial'ish book like <i>Grails In Action</i> I might go through <i>almost</i> cover to cover, but at some point when I've learned enough to start ""doing stuff"" I tend to start skipping around.  Books like that I often never technically ""finish."" Other reference books I pick up, skip to the section I care about, read that part, then put it aside and never touch it again.  For example, I'm skipping around in <i>Mahout In Action</i> now, focusing on the section on clustering.<p>Sometimes I read just the part I need <i>now</i> then put the book in the ""read this entire book later"" pile.  Then it just goes in the queue with all the other partially read books.<p>So, following this system the time span I spend on any given book might range from 6-7 hours (like the last Dean Koontz novel I read) to 20+ years ( I think I started Douglas Hofstadter's <i>Metamagical Themas</i> at least that long ago, and it's still in the ""come back and finish this later"" pile.)",1298490457

We had to build an app to put in our page for contest sign ups. When we first started developing this, their Developer app wouldn't load for 2 days. Besides posting on several official facebook page discussion boards and emailing the company to an auto bounce account, we had very little luck making contact with the company.<p>Our client then wanted to change the first letter of the page name to a lower case. The page has over 1000 fans, so we couldn't even submit a name change request through the page admin. The Help site said it could be requested but provided no means to contact facebook.<p>Now, we're also seeing memcache problems on facebook's end. Two of our page tabs changed names mid day yesterday. The FBML app is set to use the name 'Rules and Regs', but is now displaying FBML as its name. Our other app is set correctly in the developer's app but is using the tab name we set the first day we created the app.<p>Is there any way to notify facebook and maybe get a human being to acknowledge our problems from a company so desperate to connect the world's people?",1298489419

2255301,comment,2254299,2254761,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"True, there are many possible configurations, but a few (I don't have widespread experience with Python based hosts because most of my Python work has been on my own servers) hosts I've used have mod_wsgi installed with a WSGIDaemon process pointing at the application directory with index.wsgi being one of the index handlers. What you are supposed to provide is an application with a route through an index.wsgi file. In Pylon's case (this is how I have my server setup) index.wsgi is simply loading the Pylons app and providing it as a wrapped ""application"" class as a callable. Very standard and very easy.<p>As an example, here is the index.wsgi front-controller that loads my Pylons app (note, mine is more complicated than I'm showing here because I use virtualenv to contain the app):<p><pre><code>    from paste.deploy import loadapp
    application = loadapp('config:/home/my_app/production/production.ini')
</code></pre>
The <i>host</i> makes sure that the Apache vhost has mod_wsgi configured to run a WSGIDaemon process for the /home/my_app/production directory - typically (in the case of WebFaction) they give you an interface that handles all of that (so you can run multiple apps out of the same top level directory) in the course of creating your ""sites"", the same exact process you would go through for creating ""sites"" for a PHP based application.<p>Also, you don't need to tailor RPM's to the distribution, you can package your app as a python egg (which is cross-platform and contains the dependency links in your setup.py). I almost think this is easier than (S)FTP'ing the app up to your host. If your host gives you SSH access (which all $5 a month hosts do as far as I know - the crappier ones put you through a verification process, but a good one will give it to you the minute you are signed up) you can easily rsync the app up and then run ""python setup.py whatevercommandyourappuses"" and bam - you're good to go.<p>You could even put the database creation steps into the setup.py routine - ""python setup.py build"", ""python setup.py install"" <---- build necessary directories, then build your database tables for you. Much safer (and easier) than supplying an install script that can be accessed publicly.<p>I will concede though, that the whole scenario I've just described wouldn't be easy and fast for the average joe due to their inexperience with Python and/or the command line... That kind of thing makes me wonder though why we don't have basic programming courses as a requirement in high-school. If only my father (a lawyer) knew what sed/grep/awk could do for his manipulation of documents... I'm digressing now and I'll stop.<p>I know it isn't a PHP vs. Python thing - it just frustrates me when people make the argument for an inferior tool in favor of ease of use when ultimately (as per the scenario I gave above) the more powerful tool can save you time... I came from PHP land and will not go back - thanks in part to Python and the other methodologies I've learned.",1298488130

This is how I make my living.  It would take a complete reversal of apple's attitudes and directions to get me to develop for android.  Apple treats me well, pays me on time, and has a viable market where the rules are consistent and reasonable.<p>Apple treats game developers well. Apple embraced OpenGL way back in the day so that developers could write to one API and deploy on multiple platforms (even Linux, presumably)  This isn't Java, of course, but then, Apple also supported Java completely until it became obvious Java had lost in the marketplace (or market segment.)<p>Apple provides great APIs and functionality to support games on iOS.  Maybe Google will catch up, but they're still working on allowing native development.<p>But this subscription thing is a perfect example of the disconnect between android lovers and reality.  Apple has offered a new mechanism to make payments to developers.  Do you think developers are angry about this?  You think we're switching to android because Apple allows us to sell our software by subscriptions?  Why would we be angry?  This gives us more flexibility, and saves us the hassle of setting up paypal or whatever.... I've got thousands of customers, and I can assure you, less than a fraction of a percent of them visit my website.<p>As a developer for and a user of iOS this just furthers Apple's value to me.<p>I've considered porting apps to Android. I'm not inclined to because I'd rather spend the time making new apps in a market I know is viable for my type of apps.<p>To win me over, Android would need to:
1) Provide native development (in progress)
2) provide a level of APIs and frameworks of comperable quality to Cocoa touch
3) provide a hardware reference platform and require android licensees to build to it (apparently impossible)
4) develop enough of a market of that common reference platform such that I can develop no more than 2 variations and address >%90 of the market (I develop two versions for iOS an iPad and an iPhone version.)
5) Provide a market where I can sell internationally, where people can easily buy my product, and where people are in the habit of doing so.  Right now that's three things the android market doesn't offer.",1298488055

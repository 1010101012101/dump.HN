This fellow had the highest GPA in electrical engineering and also had the second highest GPA in economics.  Simultaneously.  <p>And on the side, he was an active skydiver and practiced jui-jitsu 2x a week.  And over the course of the 4 years we spent in undergrad, I don't think I ever saw him study (I'm not exaggerating).<p>So it is possible to be off the charts intelligent and not be anal retentive or unbalanced.  <p> ",1194990444

Most people seem to think that using Ruby or LISP makes them superior to <i> thosepoor Java programmers</i> while in the end all they are creating is a web-app like <i>twitter</i> (and of course think they are changing the world with this!). There are many Java programmers that are better than you.<p>And yes, as mentioned before they are using JVM which means you aren't limited to a single language(Java).",1194990415

79499,comment,79469,79469,0,0,hugh,,,"Reasons why this may not be such a big deal:<p>1. Diesel-electric submarines from various countries (including, I think, Germany and Australia) have been known to lurk near US aircraft carriers before. It's not that surprising that a Chinese one managed it too.<p>2. We don't know whether the submarine actually managed to sneak up on the carrier, or whether it just lurked at the bottom and waited for it to approach.<p>3. The Kittyhawk is an old carrier and doesn't have all the anti-submarine warfare capabilities of the newer ones.<p>4. For all we know, the carrier might have detected the submarine anyway and decided to pretend it didn't, so they can avoid giving away how good their sonar actually is.<p>Regardless of what the British tabloids might think, I don't necessarily think this represents a ""serious geopolitical change"".",1194988286

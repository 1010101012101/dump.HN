Are you afraid that your host will steal/look at your data, or other external baddies?<p>If it's external baddies, then yes, I suppose that's something to be concerned about... If you're the only developer, or you only need an internal repository (i.e. on a LAN) then I'd just host it locally and back up regularly to a secure host.",1207305949

Not useful if you need lots of storage though. 750GB drives are definitely the most value for money at the moment.",1207305928

If I were you, I would find out about the status of the IP (who owns, how old it is, etc.) and try to find out if the university is interested in it or not. If they are not interested in it, ask them to sign over the IP to you outright. After you personally own the IP, you can do whatever you want with it, and it will be the universities tough luck that they weren't able to capitalise on the IP when they had it - they've had their chance.<p>I know of three university spin-out companies that have had IP they developed assigned over to them because the university wasn't interested, upon which successful companies have been formed.<p>Also, I don't know about tech transfer offices in the states, but in the UK, they are completely incompetent. I wouldn't waste my time or effort in trying to negotiate a licensing deal. You probably could have re-written it by then!",1207305362

Sure, the fact they were generic probably helped a lot on exit, because people rightly or wrongly still see them as a big advantage.<p>Fact is, pizza.com doesn't get any traffic. They will have to spend a lot more money making it so that it does get traffic.<p>For example, you could either spend $2.6m on a generic domain, and spend another say $2m on building a site/marketing etc, or you could register 'somethingpizza.com' for $10 and spend $4m on building the site/marketing.<p>I'd put my money on the second option. But I guess it depends if there's someone else further down the line that believes it's worth say $3.6m, then you make a profit out of doing nothing.",1207305001

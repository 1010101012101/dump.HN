I work as Director - Business Development for a mobile internet company in my day job. I've been thinking about quitting my job and doing this full-time but, i am not sure if its such a good idea to take the plunge during current economic times.<p>I am stating personal and project related data points and a couple of options. Do you think it might be a good idea to take the plunge?<p>Personal<p>Education - BS (Computer Science) and MBA from top tier school
Experience - Software Engineer (2yrs), Marketing/Sales/BD (3yrs)<p>Product<p>Proven concept applied to a niche segment (I guess 2-3mn and growing)
Using open source - zero product development costs so far.
Demographics - predominently 22 - 30, very affluent male.<p>Traction

I bought a house recently.<p>Paid - 25%
Savings - 40%
Deficit - 35%<p>I can stretch the savings to pay the mortgage for next 12-18 months. I would need to work for 12-16 months to save 35%.<p>Options<p>Option 1: Work for a year and pay for the house before taking the plunge<p>Option 2: Take the plunge hoping things will work-out in next 12-18 months (while the savings last)<p>What do you suggest?",1228118212

And speaking of interactivity, it really needs an 'undo'.<p>I'd like to read a blog post about the details of how you did it.",1228117067

381485,comment,381232,381292,0,0,tremendo,,,"<i>I would also add actually having some text to put in the site helps</i><p>Do you have Javascript disabled? Apparently in this (24ways) and an increasing number of sites you now need javascript to display the actual content of a page. I find that extremely irritating. Facebook in particular is extremely annoying in using scripts to load remote scripts that in turn load more scripts from a multitude of different sites, and refusing to run any make the whole experience pretty painful. Sigh...<p>_update:_ An hour later they've fixed this bug and now content does display without javascript. Comments still need it though. Surely they'll fix that one too since it's one of the points made in the article (progressive enhancement).",1228116655

We are going to release a product which performs automatic transformations on data, with an easy-to-use interface based on building examples.<p>For example, let's say you have a data entry team which has painstakingly transcribed 100,000 customer entries over the years.  Their phone number field is an absolute mess -- some customers write 4567890, some write 123 456 7890, some write (123) 456-7890, etc.  You want this to be consistent.  You could either hire a DBA to do some database/regexp wizardry for you, or you could just write a single example of the proper canonical phone number and our software will <i>just work</i>.<p>For an example, try playing directly with this test data:

I've been waiting for an easy to use spreadsheet app that would let me do this for a while without having to figure out formulas or vbscript. This looks useful and I'll definitely use it as needed in the future.<p>What's your business model for this? Are you just doing advertising or are you also offering a rush fee or maybe charging extra for files over 5MB or something?",1228116237

If you did, was it SPARC or AMD-based?<p>Heck, when was the last time you bought any desktop system instead of a laptop for development or science work? Sun's hardware is very cool, but desktop machines that neither dirt-cheap nor monster gaming systems are a hard sell these days.<p>On the other hand, if you want to develop software that targets the SPARC ISA -- and there are lots of reasons to do so -- you can easily pick up an entry-level config of a 1U SPARC server, and rack it up wherever you like.",1228116033

He isn't promising them future business or renegotiating on a contract boundary, he is trying to stretch out payments because of cash flow issues.<p>I am completely in favor of negotiating aggressively, but I like my word and my signature on a contract to mean something, if only because that has value in future negotiations.<p>As to your situation I don't understand why you didn't negotiate a better deal up front if all of these numbers were available to you? Why not break out hardware reimbursement from bandwidth, rack space, and other services and work out a payment schedule that meets your needs and theirs in parallel with negotiations with other vendors? You have far more leverage when negotiating in parallel than when you are refusing to pay.<p>Why sign a contract and then renege six months in?  The impact on your reputation (based on who else they may talk to or get called for a reference) and your next negotiation with this vendor has yet to be felt but I wouldn't rely on it being negligible.",1228115150

10207951,comment,10207454,10207454,0,0,oneJob,,,"Attempting to force Google to change course on this would at best result in an empty gesture on Google&#x27;s part with likely no follow up regarding the bigger project. They may open up what is already scanned, but they&#x27;re not likely to resume the project under benevolent terms.<p>Employment used to last as lifetime. One could retire from Sears with decent benefits if they were loyal. Today, many of us are contract employees or Uber style &quot;partners&quot;. This is the same phenomenon we see happening here, just on the product side. We&#x27;ve been going down this road for a while now. You often don&#x27;t buy products that last a lifetime anymore. It&#x27;s often necessary to buy a whole new one rather than fix the one you already have because the replacement parts aren&#x27;t made available. So, it&#x27;s happened to our workforce and our products, now it is also happening to our companies. Always in the name of profit. Fair weather friends.<p>Sometimes this is good. Sometimes it is bad. Almost always it is a false choice.<p>The logic of capitalism insists on competition and specialization which are often at odds with cooperation and leisure. Why should Google need to choose between the bottom line and benefiting its community by sharing the work they&#x27;ve already accomplished. In a word, competition.<p>To me, this is the greatest strength of open-source. It allows for cooperation and facilitates transparency, the very foundations of community. Open-source has done nothing to stymie specialization, one of the main thrusts of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. The other, self interest serving the whole, I think, has been shown by history and OSS to be one possible, but not the sole, idea regarding what motivations might facilitate a productive community.<p>So, back to Google Books. What happened to Google Books is exactly what one should expect to have happened in a political-economy such as ours. A different outcome would not necessarily have resulted from different decisions by Google, but by different incentives and structures of a different economic framework. Let&#x27;s not be distracted by the red herring of this anecdote, framing it as a one off, but instead look to this anecdote as a case study in a much larger domain.",1442062417
10207950,comment,10204255,10207873,0,0,vidarh,,,"> Language is ambiguous, but not THAT ambiguous. People generally understand symbolic cues, unless we&#x27;re talking about some extreme &quot;avant guard&quot; kind of art.<p>My experience is that the moment people start trying to interpret symbolism in literature, all bets are off and you can&#x27;t assume they&#x27;ll even apply basic logic.<p>> Most of these clues after all have been honed for millenia, and are part of the cultural landscape.<p>... most of the time without taking feedback from actual evidence. When faced with actual evidence (such as, e.g., asking the author) it all too often crumbles into nothing. I&#x27;m not questioning that people can sometimes pick it up. But I don&#x27;t for a second believe that people are very at good at it, because I&#x27;ve seen all too many time how people supposedly good at it totally butcher works.<p>> And if people are at least partially involved in art/literature etc, they learn even more of classic tropes and symbolic use of words (or images, in cinema).<p>Part of the problem is that people massively over-interpret. The presence of something looks like a classic trope or symbolic use of words does not mean the author intended it, or was aware.<p>> Even combined with a 8 page detailed pamphlet, with what can happen to you, side-effects et al, most young people still sneer at it and ignore it.<p>That&#x27;s because describing what can happen to you and side effects is not a persuasive argument for not taking drugs because it totally ignores why people take drugs in the first place, and because they don&#x27;t provide any reasons to trust.",1442062416

10207947,comment,10207710,10207893,0,0,flexie,,,"The distance between the units in a transportation system such as railroads, freeways or this Skytran is called &quot;headway&quot;. Headway is mainly determined by breaking time. They say the capsules can break to 0 in just 16 meters so theoretically you could have one capsule per 20 meters or so (although I doubt that would be safe or feel comfortable). That&#x27;s 20 meters for 2 passengers, which means that you need 1 km track for 100 passengers. If the Skytran really goes 250 km/h you could move something like 250*100 = 25,000 persons per hour per rail if the capsules are full, or 12,500 if they are half full. That could easily compete with cars, trains, metro systems, buses etc.<p>But if the headway is really 100 meters, then we are down to 20 persons per km, and if the Skytran really &quot;only&quot; goes 150 km/h then we are transporting some 3,000 persons per hour if the capsules are full or some 1,500 if they are half full which is much less than a typical metro.<p>If we go by one capsule per 20 meters, we would use up to 12,500 capsules per hour meaning that we would have to launch another capsule with one or two passengers from side tracks onto the main track every .29 seconds in peak hour. And they would not be launched on the track from the same end station and unloaded on the same end station but from many different stations on the track. That&#x27;s a job for a programmer to figure out how that&#x27;s done safely but I don&#x27;t see it happening.<p>And quite frankly, if you do have the backing of NASA and rich investors and this whole thing is so cheap and fast to build as they claim, why don&#x27;t they just build a full scale version in some town somewhere? I see only animations and prototypes.",1442062293

The ad/tracking industry seems to be incapable of writing JavaScript that is not awful. I don&#x27;t have insight why that happens, but all the scripts I had to deal with were layers upon layers of document.write, iframes, redirects and copy&pasted JS from the Netscape 4 era. Even when somebody tries to fix it, the best they can do is to add one more layer of scripts on top of the rotting pile.<p>2. Business deals are made with no consideration of 3rd party&#x27;s code quality and performance impact. Once the deal is signed the developers are just tasked with integrating all of the crap the 3rd party vendor wants. It&#x27;s impossible to object: the vendor is not going to rewrite all of their shitty scripts, especially after the deal is already in place. Even when it&#x27;s really bad, arguing about it just results in endless meetings, conference calls and at best the 3rd party vendor saying they&#x27;ll think about putting some little tweak in the backlog for some future release.",1442061624

People generally understand symbolic cues, unless we&#x27;re talking about some extreme &quot;avant guard&quot; kind of art.<p>Most of these clues after all have been honed for millenia, and are part of the cultural landscape.<p>And if people are at least partially involved in art/literature etc, they learn even more of classic tropes and symbolic use of words (or images, in cinema).<p>And if the miss a few symbolisms, they can still get others in the same work, and have a general grap of the message. One of the joys with songs/poems/fiction etc is discovering new levels and depth you didn&#x27;t see at first (e.g. as you gain more experience with life to relate to them, or as you learn some cultural information that helps you decipher a clue).<p>In the end, it&#x27;s also up to how good the poet/writer/storyteller is, and how opaque or transparent he wants to make his story.<p>><i>People ignore &quot;don&#x27;t do drugs&quot; not because it&#x27;s straightforward, but because it is trying to command you to do something without making a persuasive argument why</i><p>Not really (from the point I come from).

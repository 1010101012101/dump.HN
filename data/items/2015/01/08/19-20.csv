The software implementing the communications protocols can still be vulnerable. So the procedures for maintaining the airgap matter. Schneier has some good pointers on this.<p>> What do you consider an &quot;airgapped machine&quot;?<p>A machine that, once set up, never sees a network. At the limit, set up one machine, scan that disk image for viruses, then install it on a second identical machine.",1420747180

The cultural adaptation to a grossly over-aggressive police force is the major cost: fear, oppression, distrust, etc.<p>As far as Singapore goes, I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience there to comment. If their standards end up leading the police to proactively treat people like criminals, then I suppose I wouldn&#x27;t like that very much.<p>Worth noting that Asian culture in general seems to have much more of a &quot;compromise the individual for the good of the whole&quot; component, though.

Astroturfing has been the norm for a few years now-- probably more years than I suspect, but the biggest difference was pre-2011.<p>2. Most people don&#x27;t even have astroturfing on their radar, and if the public ever did get any ideas, you can be sure they would be astroturfed into actually believing that astroturfing is a legitimate marketing technique rather than repugnant lying.<p>3. Astroturfing varies wildly in quality, and I&#x27;m sure that some people could spot the weaker campaigns-- the most recent major campaign that was weak was probably the pro-Russia astroturfing of Reddit during Russia&#x27;s invasion of Crimea.<p>4. The quality of astroturf is inversely proportional to the time and thus money it requires to produce. A cheap statement &quot;X is great, support X&quot; blasted into every topic is easy to spot, whereas custom tailored shilling and misdirection is often far more insidious.<p>5. I&#x27;d expect that most governments engage in astroturfing and shilling heavily-- if not on their own population (which is extremely likely) then on other populations. As evidence, consider that Eglin AFB is the &quot;most addicted to reddit&quot; community. I&#x27;m not sure what to do about this other than call it out when I see it, which is woefully ineffective.",1420747061

It would likely commoditize the service of providing Internet addressable IP routing and set it on a path for cutting all of the margin out of the business for the ISP, while likely doing nothing to cut the overall cost of the combined service to the consumer.

I might also be completely wrong, and that is actually the better way to go (or the path that people will be happy to travel once they discover assembly)<p>It feels like assembly is deconstructing the startup model (which is probably good and bad, maybe mostly good):<p><pre><code>   - (+/- technical) founder => person with idea\n\n   - initial dev team => contributors\n\n   - VC  => Assembly (w/ revenue share instead of equity)\n</code></pre>\nBut I think that something gets lost in that deconstruction. The founders become &quot;just&quot; people with ideas, and not people who grew, nurtured and fostered a company/entity. I realize they are the core team, but learning all the accounting, finances, legal, and operating costs bits are kind of valuable to a budding founder. I may even go as far as to say that a person with an idea != a founder specifically because of the transformation that happens from having to deal with all that administration (otherwise known as running a company).<p>Similarly for the dev team, they&#x27;re invested... but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as invested as they could be, or as part of the living breathing entity (figuratively) that is the company -- it&#x27;s almost like being a freelancer/contract worker (more the disenfranchisement that might occur, I think, less the health benefits/other usual problems)<p>And while the marketplace itself (Assembly) takes on quite a fair bit of risk in hosting the sites and providing all those services for free... I can&#x27;t help but feel like the profit they may make comes at the cost of stunting the growth of a founder and her/his development team.<p>If I could put it in a sentence, I might say that this system makes it easier to treat people as cogs.<p>On the flip side, this could be a completely inane over-reaction, I may be on the wrong side of a trend that is about to be huge, and streamline startup culture in a big way.",1420746656

8858486,comment,8856864,8857793,0,0,exelius,,,"It&#x27;s not really that simple - try to remember how cable companies started. The basic idea is that if you lived in a remote area and the TV signal was blocked by mountains, you and a bunch of your neighbors would build a tower up on a ridge with an antenna and some signal boosting equipment. Then along came satellite TV (think 6m dishes, not DirecTV), so instead of a terrestrial antenna, the coax cables hooked up to a satellite dish.<p>This is pretty much how cable worked until the mid-90s: cable wasn&#x27;t much more than a way to broadcast satellite video content using hardware that was tunable by consumer TVs. Cities had been granting exclusive licenses for years and nobody thought much of it. Regulation was unnecessary because the market was so heavily fragmented, and even the huge players didn&#x27;t serve more than a few hundred thousand homes. Since satellite dishes were relatively cheap and needed to be placed in every market, there was no benefit from economies of scale, and thus no market pressure to consolidate.<p>Enter DOCSIS. Cable companies figured out they could sell bidirectional 10mbps Internet connections with very few modifications to their infrastructure by utilizing unused frequency bands along with signal compression and encryption. This was in the days before ADSL, and most customers were on 56k dialup, so it was a big leap. ADSL was already obsolete by the time it was widely available, and cost the telcos significantly more to deploy than DOCSIS did for the cable companies. DOCSIS adoption happened very fast - and it was a lot cheaper to deploy DOCSIS if you had already done it before.<p>Internet access DOES benefit from economies of scale since terrestrial connections are far faster than satellite ones, and can be aggregated to take advantage of time sharing effects. Therefore it made sense to start connecting the various cable systems across the country, and massive consolidation happened faster than the regulators were able to react. Add in a dash of the deregulatory fever that started in the late 90s under Clinton and continued under Bush, and you have a recipe for hands-off regulation of an industry that didn&#x27;t need regulation only a few years prior. Nevermind the FCC was so preoccupied with sorting out the ILEC/CLEC mess that they totally missed cable sneaking in the back door of their outdated regulatory framework.<p>Anyway, regardless of how you feel about the issue now, it&#x27;s pretty easy to see how we got where we are today. All of the decisions made sense at the time, because we couldn&#x27;t foresee how things would play out when we were in the moment.<p>TLDR: Cable used to be harmless and fragmented until DOCSIS came around in the mid 90s. The government wasn&#x27;t used to things happening at Internet speed, so by the time it became apparent that cable companies were competing with traditional telcos, it was too late.",1420746622

Rather, it&#x27;s a way to extract and summarize similar behaviors in a way that others can interpret and apply in their own situations. The post intros this as a set of negative pathologies (not people) I had encountered as an engineer (not manager) in the previous decade, and closes with observation that we all can suffer from these in some form or another. In the end it proposes that avoiding them at scale is a cultural problem, hard fought by continually embodying, supporting, and rewarding the positive aspects of the culture, not a management problem won by platitudes.<p>Second, it is speaking from the viewpoint of someone building the foundation of an engineering culture at a startup. These are not observations of our culture at the time, but rather a set of pathologies we sought to avoid as we grew. It is true that many other companies do not eschew these pathologies, and for example, result in the title abuse referenced in many comments.<p>Finally, with respect to titles in particular, we absolutely do embrace engineering titles at Delphix. Promotions are a visible and meaningful mechanism for recognizing (through titles that persist beyond these walls) and rewarding (through compensation) our best engineers. The point is that promotions reflect <i>actual</i> impact, not the result of political scheming. As a result, people don&#x27;t listen to you differently, you don&#x27;t get fed different opportunities, and you don&#x27;t get to do more impactful things.

Guns are a very lethal method of suicide. Other methods of suicide are not as sure.  This might explain the differences in completed suicide numbers for men and women (more men die to suicide) and rates of self harm (very many more women self harm) -- men might be using more lethal methods.<p>Some members of the &quot;want to use a gun as a method of suicide group&quot; would use a different method and would complete suicide.  But certainly not all that group.  Some would use a less fatal method and attempt suicide but not die.  Others would find help before attempting suicide.<p>For a tiny US example: look at the Taft and Ellington Bridges in Washington State.  They were both used by people to complete suicide, although more people used Ellington.  After a number of people dying to suicide in a short number of days a suicide barrier was put up.

But about 20% of those dozens of cartridges that I did still buy were for games that I might not have even tried otherwise.  There were plenty that were played 0 or 1 times, then deleted forever.<p>I bought the device primarily so that I would have full access to my complete library without having to tote around physical security tokens everywhere.<p>And that is the same reason I have hard drives and alternative loaders for my PS2 and Wii.  I can play any game that I buy without getting off the couch to switch discs.  And with the Wii, there is the added benefit that I probably won&#x27;t have to open it up and replace the optical disc drive for a third time.  This has the unfortunate (for them) side effect that it is dead simple for me to pirate games on those platforms if I had the inclination.<p>So in my particular case, it would seem that the most effective anti-piracy measure would be to remove the requirement that paying customers have to continually juggle physical tokens to enjoy the content that they paid for.<p>If I have to break the security features in order to add the convenience features that I want most, the psychological barrier for piracy is lowered.  If everything that I want is already on this side of the fence, I am far less inclined to jump over it.<p>It just so happens that Steam provides the feature I like, which is easy access to a whole library.  As a result, I have on a few occasions preferred to re-license a game I already own on disc through Steam, just so I won&#x27;t have to dig up the physical disc, configure a DOSBox or WinXP VM, install drivers, make tweaks, download the official and unofficial patches, and such.<p>I already have more games than I have time to play games.  If I go to pirate something, it won&#x27;t be because I don&#x27;t want to pay, but because I don&#x27;t want to be hassled every time I want to play.<p>So the number one anti-piracy measure from my perspective is <i>DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR PAYING CUSTOMERS&#x27; TIME</i>.  That applies equally to unskippable DVD scenes, physical disc checks, and connection-always-required schemes.  Don&#x27;t waste my time, and I won&#x27;t go looking for ways to stop you from wasting my time.  It is impossible for you to irritate me into giving you more of my money.",1420745294

Jared Cohen could be wryly named Google’s “director of regime change.” According to the emails, he was trying to plant his fingerprints on some of the major historical events in the contemporary Middle East. He could be placed in Egypt during the revolution, meeting with Wael Ghonim, the Google employee whose arrest and imprisonment hours later would make him a PR-friendly symbol of the uprising in the Western press. Meetings had been planned in Palestine and Turkey, both of which—claimed Stratfor emails—were killed by the senior Google leadership as too risky. Only a few months before he met with me, Cohen was planning a trip to the edge of Iran in Azerbaijan to “engage the Iranian communities closer to the border,” as part of Google Ideas’ project on “repressive societies.” In internal emails Stratfor’s vice president for intelligence, Fred Burton (himself a former State Department security official), wrote,<p>Google is getting WH [White House] and State Dept support and air cover. In reality they are doing things the CIA cannot do . . . [Cohen] is going to get himself kidnapped or killed.

Of course, it&#x27;s very difficult to speculate how much sales were lost due to piracy or how much was gained due to the countermeasures. But comparing several games with roughly similar total sales over a long period vs. the sales by the time a crack to come out could give a nice data point to start with. If there&#x27;s a strong decline in sales per day when the crack comes out, that should be a clear indicator that piracy is hurting sales (but I find that hard to believe).<p>Judging by the article, there was a lot of serious software engineering resources put to this crack protection system. It takes thousands or tens of thousands of sales to pay back the time spent. This money and effort could have been spent on making the product better in a way that is directly visible to the customer. How many sales could have that bought?<p>But things have changed since the days this game (and article) came out. Ubiquitous Internet connectivity is now on consoles too. Games get (more) patches after they are released (well they are also more buggy on release day). The downside is not being able to play when your connection goes down (or the servers go down) but this has become somewhat acceptable (albeit it&#x27;s a nuisance).<p>It has become a lot easier to buy games online and a lot more difficult to pirate them.

That&#x27;s a massively wide brushstroke to use given the size of Facebook&#x27;s userbase, and doesn&#x27;t lead to constructive discussion.<p>The worst part is that it undermines your own point, which is a shame, because when put more sensibly it could actually be reasonable: your argument, once you strip out the vitriol, is that social media is reducing the ability of modern people to nurture deep interpersonal relationships. That&#x27;s the kind of opinion that can lead to a good discussion, with points to be made on either side, but it&#x27;s impossible to have that discussion if you start it by pre-emptively insulting everyone who would disagree with you.<p>I can absolutely understand why the mods would choose to immediately ban you, given that it was an insulting comment, the first comment on a new account, and an account which, based on the username, appears to be crafted for the sole purpose of disseminating those insults.

This book pulls back the curtain to reveal a lucrative industry of consulting firms that incentivize public activism as a marketable service. Edward Walker illustrates how, spurred by the post-sixties advocacy explosion and rising business political engagement, elite consultants have deployed new technologies to commercialize mass participation. Using evidence from interviews, surveys and public records, Grassroots for Hire paints a detailed portrait of these consultants and their clients. Today, Fortune 500 firms hire them to counter-mobilize against regulation, protest or controversy. Ironically, some advocacy groups now outsource organizing to them. Walker also finds that consultants are reshaping both participation and policymaking, but unethical &#x27;astroturf&#x27; strategies are often ineffective. This pathbreaking book calls for a rethinking of interactions between corporations, advocacy groups, and elites in politics.</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Grassroots-Hire-Consultants-American-Democracy/dp/1107619017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Grassroots-Hire-Consultants-American-D...</a>",1420743903

Part of the reason for this is that it&#x27;s common to use &#x27;overcomplete&#x27; representations where the limbs are smaller than the underlying type so that multiple operations can be performed before propagating the carries all at once.<p>This class of error is very much behind all the noise making I did at the Rust development team about treating integer overflow as a first class cause of software disaster as much as they have memory safety. Fortunately, they seem to be moving off the everything-wraps and wrapping-is-always-fine position.",1420743791

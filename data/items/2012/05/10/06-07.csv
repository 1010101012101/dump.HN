3952194,comment,3949848,3951728,5,0,moldbug,,,"Thanks for the interesting conversation, jacobolus - but I'm pretty confident that you didn't spend your childhood in colonial society.  I think what you mean is that you spent your childhood in a society whose class disparities were vaguely comparable, at least in an ideologically stereotypical way, to colonial society.<p>(Note that in all Latin American countries, including frickin' Cuba, the governing caste looks like Gael Garcia Bernal and the governed caste is black, brown or both.  See under: ""Subcomandante Marcos.""  After the 20th century it should be difficult for any ideology to claim it has some magic solution to this particular problem.)<p>Without of course disputing the actual reality you've experienced, I would suggest two ways of interpreting this perspective.<p>One is that the constant low-level violence in these postcolonial societies is not a consequence of how similar to actual colonial societies they are, but how different they are.<p>You don't see constant low-level violence when formal power is identical to informal power.  When the patron is actually an encomendero, there's no reason for forced labor (the distinction between ""forced"" and ""unforced"" labor is pretty academic to an unskilled agricultural laborer - either way, he has to work or he doesn't eat) to involve violence, because he has the formal right to command and can call on the lawful arm of the state to assist him.<p>Whether or not he <i>should</i> have this right, or rather power, is a separate question.  But note what happens when you try to eradicate these feudal structures, which of course did not arrive with the Europeans but predate them: you're driving Nature out with a pitchfork.  When the patron is just a big man, not an actual government official, his power is not in the form of policemen and soldiers, but thugs and more thugs.<p>Second, reinforcing this argument, consider the fact that everything you know about the colonial period comes from the enemies of colonialism.  Imagine if everything you knew about Jews came from people who hated Jews.  Every time a Jew committed some crime or abuse, this would be played up at maximum volume and associated with the entire Jewish race.  Exactly how the Goebbels press worked.<p>In other words, the 20th century image of colonialism is just an extension of the good old <i>Leyenda Negra</i> tradition.  I don't have to explain this to you, but for others:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Legend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Legend</a><p>I agree - the story is very sad.  I hope Mexico can find its way to a new Porfiriato sometime soon.  The first step would definitely be expelling the US Embassy - and taking every other possible measure to pretend there's nothing but ocean north of the Rio Grande.<p>Mexico is blessed with energy and food security, so it really does have the physical strength to tell Washington where it can put all its fatherly advice.  And we're certainly in no political condition to invade you!  So the main thing that's missing is cultural self-confidence.<p>Perhaps it's not too late to reinvent some kind of <i>Franquista</i> Hispanidad, Falangism, <i>sinarquismo</i>, etc:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_synarchism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_synarchism</a><p>Until that point, I'm quite confident, the beheadings etc. will continue.  Political order is something you take for granted until you find you don't have it, and then it's quite difficult to restore without applying a level of force comparable to that at the disposal of the disorderly.<p>Or to put it differently, after its century of revolution, Mexico needs martial law the way a camel that's just walked across the Sahara needs a drink of water.  It's not alone in this.  A friend of my wife's recently spent nine months in Guatemala City on a State Department journalism fellowship.  She left as impeccable a progressive as you'd ever see.  She came back with the most amazing good words for dictators and dictatorship.  If you know Guatemala City, you know why...<p>Erna Fergusson, an American no less progressive, visited Guatemala in the '30s and wrote this book:<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Guatemala.html?id=fv5kAAAAMAAJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/about/Guatemala.html?id=fv5kAA...</a><p>She describes Guatemala as ""like Mexico before the Revolution.""  Politically this is certainly the truth.  And the capital, for instance, is described as impeccably clean and crime-free.  This did not fit the author's agenda, but was just what she saw.  Again, compare!",1336632728

Do you consider the ""desktop"" to be so infantilizing as well?<p>1: filesystem > directories > files\n2: Desktop > Folders > Documents<p>They're both models for (basically) the same thing. The technical incorrectness of <i>folder</i> doesn't interfere with usage in real scenarios, unless you expect Average Joe to be structuring data as opposed to, say, collecting media. Granted, if Average Joe had mild OCD and thought of everything he did as indexes and references to some abstract node then directories clearly makes more sense, but that would be a separate system divorced from the desktop abstraction.<p>Edit: Being young of course none of this is really hammered in by convention maybe that's why I don't mind the two abstractions coexisting. Even if the terminology originated in a Windows era, it doesn't bother me in the least that Mac (and others) use it as well (for the reasons stated above).",1336632515

I am entirely with the WHO definition (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence</a>). I believe this is very important. Otherwise peace gets labeled war, war gets labeled peace, free speech is deemed violence, and violence is deemed free speech.<p>Example. If you look at history, violence in the Balkans began with the spread of nationalism into the highly fragmented populations living under the Ottoman empire. While the Ottoman regime was quite far from what we know as a liberal democracy, certain power balance was maintained, and certain groups (Jews for example) enjoyed more freedom in the Ottoman empire than in the neighboring European countries. With the fall of the empire, the newly prominent ideologues of nationalism claimed that an ethnic (as opposed to administrative, economic, social, etc) group of individuals has a right to self-determination. They relabeled <i>the lack of</i> ethnic self-determination as a condition that could only arise under violence. By postulating this ""ghost"" of centuries-old violence, they justified violence on their part against all other ethnic groups that seemed to lie in the way to ethnic self-determination. Instead of learning how to live with each other (actually they already <i>knew</i> how to live with each other, before they unlearned it that is), various groups took up arms, and the region that could potentially be as prosperous as the Scandinavian countries remains to this day the poorest region of Europe.<p>What I meant to say with that long story was that as soon as we have a situation where there is no violence being done to individuals, yet a large group claims to be violated, there is a potentially explosive situation on our hands. When there <i>is</i> violence done to individuals already, then the situation is already bad of course, and not as likely to get worse.",1336630822

I think it's fairly clear that Microsoft wants Windows RT to be an iOS and Android competitor, not ""Windows 8 on ARM"".  If you subtract the Classic mode from Windows RT it's in the same OS category as iOS, they just took a different approach to get there by basing it on their desktop OS.<p>The problem is that Microsoft has turned pretty much the entire Windows API into an undocumented API (AFAIK, please correct me if I'm misunderstanding the technical details here) and completely locked it down so that they're the only ones that can use it.  It's not necessarily simple to move a large program like IE or Office over to a new architecture, but it's going to be an order of magnitude easier to do so when you don't have to rewrite it to an entirely new API (in this case Metro) while you're at it.  Yes, Firefox can still put out a Metro version, but I would imagine that it would be a significantly greater undertaking than if they had the ability to write to Classic.<p>The unfortunate thing here is that this isn't necessarily an underhanded plot by Microsoft.  There are definitely some benefits to the more sandboxed-style apps pushed by iOS and Android vs. what you can do with a desktop OS, especially when it comes to non-powerusers that just want stuff to work.  From that point of view the Classic mode in Windows RT really shouldn't even be there at all, but if you want something like Office on ARM anytime soon then it's probably the only option.  The trouble is that Microsoft wants to provide the additional benefits of a few key Classic applications while also trying to avoid having the OS turn into a bunch of poorly-ported desktop applications and I'm not sure they can have it both ways.",1336630588

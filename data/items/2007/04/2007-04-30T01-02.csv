I'm also an MIT student that's living in Boston until at least the end of the summer.<p>Anyone who's interested in startups/hacking should come. I suggest bringing something to hack on or get feedback on (I'm probably going to be working in Espresso Royale that day).

This summer I will be aggressively expanding the operations of the site to create a UGC destination with some innovative premium services. I didn't apply to YC and will be bootstrapping development for the next few months.<p>
For the last year, I was involved with <a href=""http://www.SciLink.com"">http://www.SciLink.com</a> where I was a co-founder and the principal designer. SciLink is a social network for life-science professionals which integrates journal article data. I recently left the company to focus on finishing school and also to explore the viability of my current project.",1177897733

17986,comment,17947,17978,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Since a social network's value increases at something approaching the square of the growth rate in users [1], it makes sense for wealthy backers to be active participants early on -- which is probably why Peter Thiel has a LinkedIn profile and Tom updates his Myspace.<p>[1] And a user's incentive to join correlates with the average desirability of other users, in terms of whatever the network focuses on. Link-finding ability for reddit, popularity for Facebook/Myspace, sexual attractiveness for dating sites, disposable income for business networking sites, etc.",1177896996

17979,comment,17968,17968,0,0,pg,,,"This article gets a few things right and a few dramatically wrong.  Besides the obvious howler that I invented Lisp, the major mistakes are:<p>1. That the controversy over switching from Lisp to Python was a ""turning point"" for Reddit's traffic.  Such a minor controversy wouldn't have generated sustained traffic.  And indeed when you look at Reddit's lifetime traffic graph, there aren't any visible inflection points; it is overall a pretty smooth upward curve.<p>2. The reason Digg got more traffic was not some subtle difference in SEO strategies, but simply that (1) they started several months earlier, and (2) they promoted the site energetically to their enormous core audience of 15 year old gamers.<p>3. The reason it seems from talking to the Reddit founders that ""success was not so difficult"" is that Steve and Alexis are such understated guys.  Simple design always looks like it was easy.  Actually they worked quite hard.",1177895601

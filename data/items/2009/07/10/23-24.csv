I never expected I would see someone complain about this.<p>Firefox is following the mime types <i>exactly</i> the correct way.<p>Compare to the disaster of IE which sometimes looks at the file extension to decide how to display the document - that caused me huge problems way back.<p>Yes, a view as text option would be nice, but firefox is doing exactly the right thing by listening to the mime type.<p>If I get text/csv I don't want it showing in the browser, I want it to launch it externally. If firefox gets text/x-csrc it checks the /etc/mailcap, and does what it's told. It has no way to guess that you prefer to view it in the browser - the server said: it's a C file, and firefox listens.<p>How would you program it? How is it supposed to know that text/x-csrc should show in the browser, while text/csv is an external program? Both are listed in mailcap.<p>However, like I said, an option ""View as Text"" in the download box would be nice.",1247269417

698595,comment,698477,698477,0,0,blasdel,,,"Firefox totally fucks up MIME types in a different way -- since version 2.0.1X it is extraordinarily anal about 'respecting' the Content-Type that the server returns. It basically means that if you want your text to be displayed in the browser, you have to declare it text/plain.<p>Oh, your webserver helpfully sniffs the extension in the filesystem, and serves up some example C code as 'text/x-csrc'? There's <i>no way</i> Firefox could ever possibly display that! The default should obviously be to 'open with' an external viewer, even if that's <i>less</i> or <i>vim</i>.<p>It's not very useful to open a downloaded document using a curses program, especially when stdout is not a tty!<p>This behavior is not configurable or reversible.

698588,comment,694645,695261,0,0,apinstein,,,"Fair enough rebuttal.<p>I do agree with a lot of his conclusions, but some are misguided.<p>He seems to think that only one factor can be the critical factor, but I think he's missing the point. If someone cannot afford their mortgage, they are pretty much going to get foreclosed on. It's just a matter of time. However, the more negative equity they have, the sooner they are likely to do this.<p>Also, he craps on Obama's ""making homes affordable"" plan because of it's target of 31% housing-to-income ratio. But this program is <i>only</i> available for those with Loan-To-Value ratios under 105%, precisely because frankly it's pretty obvious that if you are way underwater on your house you are better off walking away from it.<p>Now, I don't really think that we should've spent the money on pretty much any program to save homeowners. Giving $3000 to a mortgage company for refi'ing a loan that empirically goes to foreclosure anyway 50% of the time is a giant waste of time and money. Both the banks and homeowners got screwed by entering these loans, and they should be left to rot with them.<p>It probably would've been better to try to convince banks to just turn the owners into renters for a 3-5 year period to let the mortgage market meltdown run its course while somewhat punishing both parties that entered such horrible deals.<p>Oh well.",1247267943

If and when the options are exercised, the units are granted, with the effect of giving ownership to the erstwhile option holder and of diluting the remaining members.<p>If the operating agreement is not set up to define the membership interests in the form of units, it can be amended to provide for this.  There normally are no special filings associated with this - just everyone agreeing to the changes and doing a re-draft to the document.<p>You cannot do incentive stock options (ISOs) with an LLC and so the options would be non-qualified (NQOs).  This means that, if they are not exercisable until, say, the occurrence of a liquidation event, you would be required to pay ordinary income tax on their value as of the date of such an event, i.e., the tax structure would not be particularly favorable to you.<p>You may also have tax complications arising from the way you are designating your payments as being in exchange for the options.  On this, you do need to see an attorney.  The way you guys are doing it is not ideal, as it lets the IRS put a direct measure on the value of the equity (based on the value of your billings being exchanged for it).<p>In general, then, it is legal to do what you are doing but it doesn't sound like it is being done in the best manner, given the goals of the parties.<p>I don't think there are securities law concerns here, as only certain LLC issues falls within the securities laws (remember, at its basis, an LLC is basically nothing but a traditional partnership).<p>All in all, though, you need to get good advice based on your particulars from an attorney who knows what he is doing. Though I am an attorney, I can't give specific advice in this type of forum. But I think the general ideas I have suggested should point you in the right general direction.",1247267573

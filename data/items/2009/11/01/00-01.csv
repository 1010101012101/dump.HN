However I would suggest that a degree is still a good bar to have in place.</i><p>Why is a degree any less of an arbitrary requirement than requiring extensive real-world experience (thus restricting opportunities available to many recent graduates)?<p>I think it's simply naive and foolish to exclude candidates based <i>entirely</i> on secondary indicators of their skills. First-pass filtering is easy enough based on primary indicators.<p>Moreover, due to the rapid increase of college attendance post WWII (starting with the introduction of the GI bill), college degrees are no longer a rarity -- without further context, they are not really a suitable secondary indicator of much of anything. Now you have to get a phd to stand out from the crowd.",1257034597

A good monopoly will generally turn into a bad monopoly over time, because there are no competitive forces keeping it honest. Though there are rare exceptions. A competitive market tends to be long-term stable, resulting in better sustained, long-term results for customers.<p>Google is very dominant but nothing it does could really be considered a monopoly, even search. Very few google products have significant ""lock-in"" the way most monopolistic products do.",1257034562

However, I generally disagree with the statement ""if a comment gets down voted but starts a wave of discussion surely it has value."" Trolling is, at its heart, the creation of discussion by posts of negative value, usually by eliciting a strong emotional response from readers. Most troll-posts don't have value to those trolled (though there may be exceptions).",1257034555

Buffet said many times during the dot-com boom that he wouldn't touch a tech stock with a 10 ft. pole owing to the fact that he had no clue what any of them did. When the bubble burst he had one of his best years ever by investing in brick and paint companies, IIRC.<p>So, it's not that he won't spring for a post-1992 web site because he's cheap. It's because he couldn't care less about the internet. He doesn't even have a computer. In a way I'm shocked that berkshirehathaway.com even exists. I assume they bought it to keep some idiot from hocking Viagra under that name.<p>To me, the world's richest man completely ignoring something to which many of us here devote our lives is a great reminder of the whole other physical world out there which will always be equally, if not more, as important as tech.

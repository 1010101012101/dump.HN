They just released cross-platform compilation for native OS X GUI and console applications, have 64-bit and 32-bit support.<p>In fact, the same person that invented C# first created Delphi (Anders Hejlsberg), and you can see how C# has borrowed much from Delphi.<p>Delphi, in the past 3 releases, has added native generics, anonymous methods, Unicode throughout the language by default, compiling native OS X applications, compiling iOS applications, and writing native 32-bit or 64-bit applications.<p>In addition, Pascal (and Delphi) does not have many of the serious security issues C/C++ developers have experienced, by design; e.g., format string bugs are non-existent because Delphi allocates strings on the heap.<p>Also, the Delphi community is alive and well over at StackOverflow. Unfortunately, many new developers in the US aren't familiar with Delphi...but it's extremely popular in European countries. It really is worth considering if you are writing native Windows applications that require complex GUI's done easily.",1332622785
3750712,comment,3750151,3750478,2,0,zekenie,,,"Agreed. Genetics is overrated and poorly understood. To be sure, nucleotide sequence is important in determining phenotype, but since the human genome project's findings were released, its become more and more clear that its no silver bullet. Protein expression, folding, and regulation are really complex systems. Very few pathologies actually come from DNA sequence. There's an entire emerging field, Epigenetics, which is basically heredity that is not the result of DNA sequence.<p>That blood thiner example brings up some interesting thoughts. Have they found links between specific sequences and the response to the drug? If so, this could be useful. If it is indeed really cheep to screen, it could be useful epidemiologically. It could find new associations between sequence and phenotype that weren't possible before. For example, if everyone's sequence was known, they might find that people with a certain copy of a gene didn't respond well to a certain class of drug. But, the fruits of this would come <i>after</i> everyone was sequenced, and after much study.<p>It also brings up some ethical concerns that you mentioned. What if you don't want to know you have Huntington's disease, or you are predisposed for heart disease? Or moreover, what if you don't want that information to be in a database somewhere for who-knows-who to access? These are complex issues.",1332622785

You go there to support the kind of entertainment you <i>want to see more of</i>. Anyone supporting a prospective project in that way and expecting immediate returns doesn't understand the model, at best.<p>Your argument seems to be that since crowdfunded alternatives can't immediately supplant the incumbents, there's no point to even bothering with them. There's absolutely no reason whatsoever that they can't coexist, with the new model picking up slack that comes available as the old model withers. In point of fact, that's exactly what I expect to happen, at least to some degree.<p>(EDIT: TL,DR: streaming and crowdfunding are utterly orthogonal; I'm having a very hard time understanding how and why you're conflating them.)",1332622762

3750708,story,3750036,,1,0,kijin,,,"> <i>contributor-slots</i><p>That sounds similar to an idea that I've had for several years now, but which I haven't had a chance to implement anywhere. What if you had to spend karma in order to submit stuff, and recoup it with other users' upvotes? What if voting actually transferred a small amount of karma from the voter to the submitter? What if every other method of feedback similarly behaved like an economic transaction?<p>At first, this might seem to discourage participation because people won't want to spend their all-so-precious karma. But we don't want karma whores to comment all that much anyway. Given that people get so obsessed with those meaningless numbers anyway, could we harness that obsession for some good? If people had to spend karma in order to submit stuff, every submission would be an <i>investment</i>. If they want to be able to keep investing, they would need to turn a decent ROI. If voting cost karma, that would deter circlejerks. Forcing people to think of karma as a virtual currency might just be enough to make them think seriously about the quality of their comments.<p>There would also be a mechanism to create more karma, so that the karma economy expands at a controlled rate and not everything is a zero-sum game. Daily allotments and various bonuses might work there. You might also allow karma to be destroyed, e.g. when you vote something down, the submitter loses karma but so do you. Whatever algorithm you use, the point is to produce an artificial scarcity of karma that can only be overcome with a concerted effort by the majority of users to produce quality content.",1332622730

And forced people to consider this idea as a legitimate product, instead of a weekend hack.\n2) It validated the market. More people doing similar things suggests there's a valid space there.\n3) Provided that both sites continue to operate and grow, they will continue to push eachother to do better.<p>I don't think the fact that the core product was copied is discouraging at all. I think it helps. I think the real problem you have is the manner in which it was copied. You nailed it with this line: ""Real creative comes from a personal connection to a project or idea."" <-- this is true. If the idea started with you, and you have the passion to continue executing on it, you'll stay the long haul and it will become a great product, it's your baby. Why does it matter what else is in the market? Shipping a product is half the battle - especially when you're dealing with space where there's no proprietary technology powering the product.

3750576,comment,3744268,3744627,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"A heck of a lot, and all current phone standards are based on it including current GSM.<p>GSM used TDMA which sliced a frequency into time slots.  The time slots are allocated to the phones whether there is talking or not.  This also leads to a fixed number of connections per frequency, and adjacent towers can't use the same frequency.  It is also not forwards compatible since the phones expect certain behaviour from other phones in terms of using the time slots.  That is why GSM carriers had to go out and get new frequencies when they added 2G data.<p>CDMA just has all phones broadcast at once.  The phones merely see others as noise.  When there isn't anything to transmit (voice calls have a lot of silence) then not much is transmitted.  The tower will direct power levels to phones to keep the noise as low as possible.  The net effect is that there isn't a fixed number of connections per tower/frequency, adjacent towers can use the same frequencies and it is forwards compatible - other phones can use newer versions and it won't affect current phones.  CDMA is a lot harder engineering.<p>Here are a bunch of articles describing it in more detail from someone who worked on it.<p><a href=""http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/10/GSM3G.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/10/GSM3G.shtml</a> (politics, tech, how CDMA happened)\n<a href=""http://denbeste.nu/cdmafaq/cdmatdma.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denbeste.nu/cdmafaq/cdmatdma.shtml</a> (tdma versus cdma)\n<a href=""http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/04/Howspreadingactuallyworks.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/04/Howspreadingactual...</a>  (what actually gets transmitted)",1332619960

People writing real kernels or embedded code have to write little shims in platform-specific assembly code to hook their C code up to the hardware.<p>>All the things that ""make C fast"" are really ways of making the ""underlying machine"" fast through C, and trying to come up with new language constructs that facilitate these techniques seems like a losing game.<p>Yes and no.  C's so-called speed comes from its <i>transparency</i>: everything you write in C can be cleanly mapped down to its constituent assembly code without extra code being inserted by the compiler or runtime library.  C has a fundamental principle: you only pay for what you use.  Other languages can, but mostly choose not to, emulate this.<p>>Any new languages are going to have a hard time catching up to C when it comes to compiler optimizations<p>GCC and LLVM make this not so much of a problem.  Most of the major compiler optimizations nowadays are done on intermediate representation code, not C source itself.<p>>The source language emphasizes features that allow one to write concise reasonably performant code (H-M, local inference, sum types, some kind of object polymorphism).<p>Local inference is only necessary in situations where Hindley Milner or another HM-based algorithm doesn't work (see: Scala).<p>There's bunches of languages like this.  In addition to BitC, there's also Cyclone, Rust, ATS, and Deca -- all of which are in various stages of development.  ATS has a stable release, IIRC, Rust is in alpha, Cyclone has made a release but development stopped, and Deca is in active pre-alpha development.",1332619902

The main reason for this is that each futures has a contract specification that would need to be the same across exchanges to be fungible: e.g. one contract of light-sweet crude oil is X U.S. gallons of oil at Y quality...  The other reason for this is that once the contract has been traded the exchange (or your broker) assumes the counterparty risk if you or your counterpart default on the contract -- so keeping it all on a single exchange helps everyone keep track who sold what to who.<p>Currencies are the worst: there is no central market.

Furthermore, software is an interactive medium, which makes copy protection easier, and copying riskier.

Even if you fully controlled all the hardware and software used for playback, you wouldn't control the link between the speaker and my ears.<p>As to ACH information, it depends on what you mean by ""use those numbers,"" since they have no inherent value.

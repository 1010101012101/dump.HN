I noticed on my brief foray into AppEngine that it is really easy to run up against their CPU limitations (as in, four trivial queries on a single pageload will do it), but it's amazing that you've managed to run up a $1,000/mo bill with them.<p>Or are you really burning through SQS requests fast enough to make it cost cash money?<p>Either way, it sounds like you've painted yourself into a corner it will be hard to get out of.  AppEngine is probably the most difficult platform imaginable in terms of how hard it is to migrate off of.  You'll have a ton of work to do just to get out of BigTable, and then you're left with a Django app.<p>I guess the best you can do is start charging money, and start developing a new version as quickly as possible to stop the bleeding.<p>Good luck!",1247241574

That's going to be the future employment prospects for men in the long term.<p>I would not see health care as a safe industry right now, what with the uncertainty of reform looming over our heads and what appears to be a bubble in health care in any case. Yet with job growth in healthcare, government, and education, the trend to notice isn't men and women, it's government and market. Government jobs, and jobs in highly regulated industries, seem safer at the moment than jobs in the market. Which is to be expected when government spending rises in an economic downturn.<p>If we see recovery soon, this short term trend will reverse itself and all this will be forgotten. But if we deepen into a depression, the other shoe will eventually drop once the federal government reaches a debt crisis. Then women (and, in fact, everyone in government/gov. regulated jobs) will be in the same boat. Neither outcome will really sustain this trend.",1247241532

I'm looking for some advice from fellow startup founders/alums about taking the leap from releasing your prototype into the wild to scaling your userbase and product. I'm a single founder of a Boston-based mobile app startup – the product is released, we continue to iterate and build further enhancements, our userbase is excited and giving constructive feedback, etc. We've reached the point where we are receiving interest from companies to buy the app or discuss licensing deals, but interest from local angels is basically non-existent at this point. I quote from one VC: ""idea is a feature, not a company"".<p>Here's the problem: I'm completely broke. For this startup, I chose the bootstrapping route. I plunged most of my savings and used credit cards to work with an offshore team and received investment from friends and family to make it past the prototype stage. My development team is willing to take an equity stake to improve the product, but server costs are expensive. Our userbase increased 20x when I dropped the app to free 1 week ago. I cannot afford to pump in $30-40 a day to pay for server costs.<p>The acquisition talks are positive (it would be a very small exit), but I'd really like to work on building out a company here. Is there any option other than an angel round to make it to the next stage?

Wittgenstein was regarded from early in his life as a genius. He was considered a very eccentric genius (that's putting it mildly), but <i>in his own lifetime</i> he was successful and well regarded.

Single threading has a big effect on how discussions go. It's hard to put into words..

These devices seem to have grown out of the OLPC and intel's long time goal of shrinking their chips for mobile devices.<p>But why was there so much opposition to the Foleo? The software seemed quite useful, it had WiFi so even the lack cellular wasn't that much of a limitation. Netbooks may have run Windows desktop software but were largely used for web browsing and Microsoft Office.<p>I've heard the argument from some on the Palm team that the Foleo had to die, that it was more important to focus on the new webOS platform. But what software was used in the Foleo? A custom system built around Docs-To-Go. A menu which married keyboard-driven interfaces and full screen applications. The concern was that the Foleo wouldn't run the same software as the new hardware devices and also wouldn't run PalmOS software that the Palm developers were relying on, though they all knew that those revenue streams were already drying up. Of course, the new devices barely ran PalmOS software anyway with a required additional download of a trial of an emulator. That wasn't the death of the new platform though, Android and iOS were.<p>I'm aware that the Foleo was underpowered, but it was the first generation of a new device. It was the first netbook, and it is very similar in a lof of important ways to the new Microsoft Surface going on the size of the display and use of ARM processor.",1352068800

4741332,comment,4740839,4740839,10,0,tikhonj,,,"In the recent past, I've spent a decent amount of time commuting by train. I've used Caltrain (which is fine), Bart (which is usually nicer) and even both (which is... less nice).<p>I've actually found the train ride to be <i>valuable</i>. It gave me an hour or two a day of uninterrupted time when I could focus on what <i>I</i> wanted to do: either work on my side projects or read books.<p>In the recent past, I've been too busy to read much fiction; having time on a train which was ""useless"" anyhow let me get back into it. I enjoyed a whole bunch of fantasy and SF novels thanks to having a commute. This is where something like a Kindle <i>really</i> helps: it's light and convenient enough to read even if I can't get a seat, and I can carry as many books at once as I want. It also let me re-read the Wheel of Time series on the train, which would not have been practical with hardcover (or even paperback) copies of the books :P.<p>If I did manage to get a seat--and, since I often travelled at off-peak hours, I usually did--I had other options as well. For one, I could work on my own projects. This was particularly nice because I had a very limited amount of time, say exactly 40 minutes. This helped me focus on specific tasks, like fixing some bugs, that would have been less interesting if I was planning to work for several hours at home.<p>Another option was reading non-fiction. I actually learned a good deal about theoretical CS, programming languages and type theory last summer. Partly, this was because I was working at an awesome startup; however, reading academic material on the train also helped immensely. Since the train had less distractions than virtually anywhere else I spend time, I was able to get through denser passages without any compulsions to do something else (like go on HN :P).<p>I've also found the train a good place to read CS papers; since the time I can spend on it is inherently limited, it helps me get a quick overview that is neither too deep nor too shallow. Given an unbounded amount of time, I tend to either quickly skim a paper and get distracted or spend far too much time thinking about particular details. Reading something on a train helps me get a holistic and useful first impression.<p>One thing I've learned from experience: if at all possible, avoid transfers. This is especially bad between different services like Caltrain and Bart, but even Bart's timed transfers are decidedly sub-optimal. Two 20-minute chunks with a five-minute break in the middle are <i>significantly</i> less useful than a single 40-minute chunk. Also, knowing you will have to get up to transfer soon definitely creates more of an overhead for opening your laptop or getting a book out of your bag.<p>Anyhow, in total, I'm actually pretty happy if I can commute by train. Even though it does take up a fair amount of time, the time can actually be useful. I've even found the constraints make me more productive for certain things than just having that time at home.",1352068559

Really.<p>1. A hardware company can choose to <i>sell</i> its products to whatever class of customers it likes. It doesn't have to cater to a particular subset of philosophical adherents, when marketing a product. It might not be realistic to ask a person to pay money for a product, when they can only marshal so many hands from a finite set of costly human resources, to meet the demands of a certain type of customer.<p>2. It makes sense for a <i>small</i> hardware company to cater to users of for-profit proprietary operating systems, <i>mostly</i> because there's hard incentive for makers of proprietary libraries to support their software in kind (ie: you can enforce an annual contract against Microsoft, but GNU?). This is the exact business model that Microsoft has preyed upon and grown fat off of for years.<p>3. The open source community has a reputation for taking on all comers. This is to say that when the going gets tough, and there's real demand for something awesome, the open source community will step up and brute force a project into submission. We have a reputation for pulling our own weight when it counts.<p>I don't think it's correct to frown upon a hardware company because it doesn't cater to open source philosophies. It's not always easy to turn that kind of pie-in-the-sky demand into something that pays the very real bills.<p>I think it's correct to frown upon a company that espouses vehement animosity towards a hacker community that it could wisely cultivate as a neutral ally, that neither helps nor harms profits. Companies that actively spearhead campaigns of criminal prosecution and litigation against hobbyists that mean no harm (and often increase demand, or frequently support their own demand) ...that kind of behavior is toxic.<p>In other words:<p>if people buy your goods, they should feel free to use them as the please, and if they figure out new unintended uses for those goods, great! But that doesn't obligate the maker to now support an unexpected, unplanned emergent behavior, however popular it may be.",1352068532

Nobody in the world thinks it's really a good idea to give cigarettes to little children. But there are plenty of parents who wouldn't bat an eyelash if their own child ingested a magnet. That's the problem.<p>The regulation proposed on magnets is effectively identical in principle to the regulation against lawn darts back in 1988. Any idiot can look at a lawn dart --- a large, bottom-heavy weighted metal dart meant for throwing --- and intuit that the pointy end needs to be kept away from kids heads. And yet kids were routinely showing up in the emergency room with darts in embedded in their skulls. In fact, they still were in 1997!<p>These kinds of determinations are literally the whole reason we have a CPSC. The CPSC is only suddenly a threat to our civil liberties because they pushed back on a nerd toy. I'm sure the manufacturers of lawn darts were plenty pissed too, but we didn't have the message boards back then to hear about it.<p>Nobody, including the CPSC, is saying that rare earth magents are intrinsically evil, or that <i>you</i> shouldn't be allowed to have them. And so you'll be able to keep buying them even after this rule is put in place. The CPSC is simply saying that tiny magnets make a bad toy, just like weighted darts did.<p>And note that it isn't the evil, capricious CPSC that's behind this; the movement to suppress this particular bad toy was spearheaded by the American Pediatric Association.",1352066969

Its main exports (other than ""tourism"" which doesn't count) is through secondary products like petroleum, and through its workforce, considered high-value by companies around the world.<p>Its workforce, being a resource, is therefore treated like a resource. And resources must always be more readily available, more efficiently farmed, more accurately quantified. The only way to survive in this country is to go through the gauntlet, and get stamped with a quality grade like beef.<p>My personal hope for the future of Singapore is to slowly make the transition away from treating its humans as a workforce resource, and to start treasuring their humans as a knowledge bank. Indeed, I believe Singapore has realised this, with its growing bio-technology sector, A* etc. However it is a race against time; unlike other resources, its workforce can turn against it.<p>No I'm not really speaking about revolution etc. But years of being a resource has put a toll on the population... just as a engine that is run in overdrive for too long wears out. Many of the Singaporeans who can afford to find a better life elsewhere, where their knowledge is valued higher, are doing so. Those that do not have that knowledge are simply resigned to being the nation's workhorse, and take no effort to seek it themselves (or perhaps they cannot afford to).<p>This puts Singapore in a weird position. It is suffering from ""brain drain"". And the current remedy for it is importing knowledge from elsewhere. Unlike regions like the US, EU, AU, where populations are made up of many varieties of cultures, Singapore is a young country with only 3 major ethnic groups, and outsiders are viewed as such. This further axacerbates the feeling that local workers are just their workers.<p>Anyway, after that long blob, my 2nd personal hope is I may be able to return to my country and contribute back, not through workhours, but through knowledge.<p>Disclaimer: this is all my views and intuition, I don't have any links or numbers to back things up.",1352066778

Serious question! :-)<p>No, not really. There is usually ~1 article each day where I get interested in reading the discussion. When that happens, it is often disappointing to find the discussion high-jacked by a top-voted comment that goes in a direction that doesn't interest me. I'm sure there are interesting comments further down the page, but on this site it's hard to find them. I think Slashdot handles this a little better by letting you set a point threshold.<p>In the even fewer cases when I want to join the discussion, it is pretty meaningless to add a comment to the bottom of a page which is more than a day old.<p>> I think the issue isn't curation, since Slashdot is technically an editor curated news service, but the timing. That is, how do you have a good discussion when the timescales are so large rather than over the course of a few hours?<p>Yes! That frames the question much better.<p>> Sites like MetaFilter - <a href=""http://www.metafilter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metafilter.com/</a>, Edward Tufte's forum - <a href=""http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a?topic_id=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a?topic_id=1</a>, QBN - <a href=""http://www.qbn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qbn.com/</a> - and numerous blogs have solved this problem to a great extent, IMHO, and intriguingly are all single threaded (or in the case of blogs, most, but not all).<p>Haven't used those sites, and it was hard to get a grip by taking a quick look. How do they solve it? I think single threaded is great, but in my experience it breaks down when the number of comments get too large.<p>Manually or semi-automatically curated discussions would probable be very valuable.",1352066462

4741243,comment,4739951,4741143,6,0,pdeuchler,,,"You mistake the point of my comment.<p>This ruling may be devastating on companies like Zucker's, however that is what happens when your business relies upon a product that is then regulated away by the government. Zucker should have known the risks when he got into the industry, and at least should have known the risks when doing business within the United States.<p>I see this ruling more as an attack on what I can purchase as a consumer. Why is the government telling me what I cannot buy, or even what I cannot give to my children? If you really want to get into it, I'd be more than happy to tell you why I think the CPSC itself is a threatening institution to my civil liberties, but that seems rather out of scope. What makes this ruling more egregious than any other that comes to mind is that it seems to have been made selectively and without good reason. Warning labels were not sufficient, yet the warning label on a box of cigarrettes is just gravy? If you work out the percentages, regardless of the potential to do harm, not that much comparative harm was really done.<p>So why was this done? It doesn't take the harmful objects out of the market, so why set this precedent? It makes me wonder what they could do to, say, maybe a politically charged children's book?",1352066413

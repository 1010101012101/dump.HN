Real-time remote collaboration is novel enough to be able to say that not only interfaces need to be developed for it but also behaviours, etiquette, metaphors -- culture. You could see this with Wave. They were so desperate to hold peoples' attention that they came up with all these new and slightly silly words to help people conceptualise what it was they were suddenly able to 'do'. Too much. Too soon. Too not-for-you-to-determine.<p>Meanwhile an idea that anyone on the street can easily formulate (shared text editing) is still not widely available in a usable form. It's like promoting the Twitter API and ushering everyone into a new world where everything is a tweet and a tweet is everything, before you have a working tool for personal subscription-based SMS distribution. All these other 'features'... they're not. They're proposed desirable activities. Whether or not they're actually desirable is a cultural development, not a software development. Until people begin to take living, multi-author, <i>simple</i> documents for granted on a large scale, it's really too soon to say if it's a good thing that Bob can embed a sudoku game in the agenda draft or whether a poll and comment thread is a good way to decide where to have coffee or just a bit weird actually.",1300031622

2319387,comment,2318980,2318980,0,0,neutronicus,,,"The article is mostly correct, but a few corrections from a nuclear engineer:<p>1. What he refers to as ""moderator rods"" are actually control rods.  The term ""moderator"" refers to a material that is <i>unlikely</i> to absorb neutrons, but likely to scatter them.  This helps lower the average neutron speed inside the reactor, which actually <i>increases</i> the fission rate.  Since water serves this purpose just fine, most reactors do not have specific ""moderator rods"", although BWRs actually run pipes of liquid water through the fuel assemblies for additional moderation.<p>2. BWRs are not run all-rods-out, like he claims.  BWRs are generally run with significant control rod insertion, so that the water stays liquid for a greater portion of the height of the core.<p>3. He doesn't quite explain that the source of the hydrogen is a replacement reaction where zirconium and water react to create zirconium oxide and hydrogen gas.<p>4. Xenon-135 is a fission product, not produced by neutron activation, and neutron activation of coolant is nothing to sneer at (the half-life of tritium is 12.3 years).",1300031002

Although he's refined and modified his theories with experience in applying them to many real situations, the book is no where near as well written, even includes a constant stream of ridiculous puns (in the aviation chapter), often uses casual language - and doesn't provide any actual data.  Also, the second two books are only <i>co</i>-authored by Christensen (who is a Rhodes Scholar btw).<p>That said, something like this may be a better resource: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology</a> and it's all over the web in general, so googling works.<p>You may also like Moore's ""Crossing the Chasm"" - the same ideas independently developed at the same time, but a how-to guide, rather than an academic description.

While I was rolling out an updated version of an inhouse application a serious bug was discovered. The application was used as part of chemotherapy follow-up/planning and on some occasions it gave the wrong answer for a test. I discovered that the bug was old and that wrong answers had been given for a long period. Personally I was relieved that I had not caused the bug, but from a medical perspective it would have been better if the bug was new and had only affected very few patients.<p>My takeaway from that experience is that care should be taken when writing critical software, but also that we will make mistakes and it is very important to always focus on how we can make fewer mistakes instead of pointing fingers.",1376596418

If I have to explicitly list them, what have I gained? To put it another way, the equivalent output to the example is:<p><pre><code>  (?:foo|bar|baz|quux)
</code></pre>
it is one character longer than what was produced<p><pre><code>  (?:ba[rz]|foo|quux)
</code></pre>
but can reasonably argued to be clearer.<p>What I was getting at with my pseudo-code example is that if the goal is to interpret the input down to the fewest possible states from examples, then the regular expression is redundant - all we need are the examples and `if`.<p>There&#x27;s shorter syntax:<p><pre><code>  > (frak/pattern [Clojure|Clojars|ClojureScript])

  #&quot;(?:Clojure|Clojars|ClojureScript)&quot;

Why not use the simplest possible syntactic sugar?<p>As I said in my first comment, I understand the reasons for creating Frak. I find thinking about it stimulating and illuminating.

I&#x27;m currently working fulltime with python web development but have set a goal of working fulltime on freelance projects starting
later this year.  What I&#x27;m really wondering though is if my conception of what working freelance fulltime is like actually
fits with the reality of the lifestyle.  My ideal workstyle, and one that I hope to be living within a year would have me working
about 30 hours a week, and pulling in 30-40k per year(ok, ideally more but I&#x27;m trying to keep expectations in check, and I don&#x27;t need much to live off of).
Is it realistic to expect to be able to achieve that within a year given that I&#x27;m a recent college grad and new freelancer?  Currently I have 2 websites I&#x27;ve 
built for clients and a mostly empty github profile that I&#x27;ll be filling out more before the freelance switch.  My main concern is the amount of work-- 
from what I&#x27;ve read many freelancers seem to work MORE than their biweekly check counterparts, not less like I would like.  So, are my expecations in line with reality 
or is freelancing not the silver bullet like I imagine it?  By the way, I&#x27;ve read the stories about needy clients, inconsistent payment, and the need to self motivate-- all that I expect(though experiencing it first hand will surely be another matter).  Preemptive thank you for the advice-- it will be extremely helpful to me(quitting a job for freelance is scary!)",1376596051

The API doesn&#x27;t actually use name sets like that. Though that was my first approach. I changed it to use lists of profiles from social networks. So when a name is requested it looks up every profile with that name and counts the number of times each gender is represented. If you use any localization parameters it will of course only look up profiles associated with the particular country or language.
I quickly realized with the initial approach that my lists would never be sufficient, since most countries allow for almost any name to be given and when combining lists from the whole world, a lot of names would end up as unisex, that&#x27;s why i went for a probability factor instead. Also i&#x27;m hoping that by using social profiles, it might one day be able to tell the gender of Superman or Catwoman and things like that. People can after all call themselves what they want on the internet.<p>I&#x27;ve actually thought about adding like a baseline of names from different lists though, to backup the names that are not yet represented in the dataset.

According to Clay Christensen, it&#x27;s about creating a product that&#x27;s cheaper and offers a better value than incumbents. In many cases, competitors are providing too much performance, and disruptive businesses offer less performance for much less money. The designer mentality tends to see problems as ugliness, and solutions as beauty, but this doesn&#x27;t fit into the disruptive innovation model. To a designer, disruptive innovation looks like taking something beautiful and replacing it with an ugly knockoffthe opposite of what they want to do!<p>This isn&#x27;t really exclusive to designers.

In other who knows what language is described by the output of Frak?<p>I am not in love with VerbalExpressions - porting it to Racket was a reasonably sized project from which I felt I could learn something about Racket, I did. And something about regular expressions, which I also did.<p>I think VerbalExpressions suffers from a bit of the same conceptual problem as Frak  - though perhaps to a lesser degree. That problem is treating Regular Expressions as something other than the formal description of a language.<p>However, I think that the transition from a muddled concept of regular expressions to correct one is more straight forward with VE - i.e. adding (kleeneStar), (atLeastOne), and (exactlyOne) to VE doesn&#x27;t break the bigger idea.<p>The general problem with anything that attempts to implement regular expressions informally can be summed up as:<p><pre><code>  Pick any two:

CPython&#x27;s GIL is not held during many file or network operations and may be released by C code. It&#x27;s true that multiprocessing is generally a better solution for distributing CPU-bound tasks across cores, but let&#x27;s not oversimplify.<p>And as some people may not know, some implementations like Jython do not have a GIL.",1376593230

So even though this article talks about a shaky self-reported study with a low sample size, I think they are <i>absolutely</i> on to something. I can relate to the findings almost perfectly.<p>Facebook is one big game of &quot;keeping up with the Jonases.&quot; Everyone&#x27;s Facebook-facing life is fantastic. They buy houses, they have kids, they go on trips, they have fun adventures with their girlfriends, and so on.<p>What you don&#x27;t see is the cockroach infestation at the new house they bought, or the sickness their kid is going through, or the fact that they had to max out their credit card for their trip, or that they got in a huge fight with their s/o right after posting pictures of hugs and kisses.<p>What this means is that browsing through Facebook is a great way to make yourself feel awful, because at any point in time you are not going to have one of the things you see on your news feed. At least I feel that way. The only reason I&#x27;m still on there is because my mom (who lives back home, in Turkey) <i>freaks out</i> when she doesn&#x27;t see regular updates from me.

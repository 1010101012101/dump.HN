But compared to the number of dictatorships and other totalitarian regimes, unless people start to go hungry, there is violence in most cases they wouldn&#x27;t rise up and choose to die on the streets for freedom. Sure some do, but and there are protests but that is not enough to overthrow the regime.<p>3. You also have to keep in mind that people you talk to here from EB countries are probably well above average. They probably had enough smarts and drive to get out. They are also more likely to not like their old countries. (Well I don&#x27;t like it either but I am trying to take a more objective approach).  Notice how we also carefully transitioned to comparing Soviet occupation to living in US probably working in the tech sector (and I am certainly guilty of it as well).

To put it another way:<p>My first few gigs during/after school, the interview was one of the hardest, most stressful parts - the actual work tended to pale in comparison. The interview rarely seemed to have any tangible connection to the actual work being done, either; it was essentially like some sort of bizarre hazing ritual where I proved that I had what it took to be an employed professional, or something.<p>At this point I&#x27;ve done thousands of phone screens and hundreds of in-person interviews over my career, so that stuff doesn&#x27;t get to me like it used to. It&#x27;s much easier to disengage and ignore all the high pressure tactics and shitty interview questions and bad interviewers and just write it off. Given that, I could probably easily end up doing the same thing to candidates when <i>I&#x27;m</i> interviewing them.<p>But I shouldn&#x27;t! Because oh my god, those first few dozen interviews were emotionally and physically exhausting. Every single one left me a nervous wreck regardless of whether it went well or not. That shit simply isn&#x27;t healthy; why would I ever inflict it on someone else?<p>&#x27;High pressure&#x27; tactics are probably the worst in this regard, out of all the things that go on in interviews. I&#x27;ve dealt with a few places that went with tactics like verbally abusing candidates during interviews, or making a subpar offer and giving the candidate 24 hours (or less!) to decide, in the hopes of getting them to panic and take it. One place had their recruiter call me up at 7am and verbally berate me for turning them down! Fucked up shit.<p>One thing I consistently hear people complain about is whiteboard coding. Nobody likes it, everyone finds it stressful. Note that the actual task of coding in an interview isn&#x27;t something I hear everyone complain about - just doing it on a whiteboard, specifically, vs doing it as a take-home &#x27;programming test&#x27; or in a shared etherpad or something.

In effect, it is a corporate ritual, an alliance between a media organisation, GQ, and a commercial entity, Hugo Boss.

I can&#x27;t talk about genres I don&#x27;t know about but for the electronic music I listen to there is a painfully obvious difference between amateur and professional stuff.  To the point where I think it is harming the genre.  The top artists earn almost nothing from sales of their music, but command large fees for playing 1-2 hours sets every weekend.<p>There is a real dearth of new talent because people getting into it just don&#x27;t have the sound engineering experience to make their music sound good enough for people to enjoy.  What happens is the big labels find producers would could have some talent, take them on board and teach them how to make the music and have the experienced engineers tidy up their work until it sounds good.  What this has resulted in is the two major labels absolutely dominating the scene with a large majority of the big names signed to them and absolutely dominating the share of music listened to.  One of the labels also owns the major online store that sells music in this genre.<p>And yet, they still make next to nothing from sales.  This is why ghost producing is so widespread in electronic music- the only money to be made is in live performances.   To get big there, you need good productions to get a name for yourself.  So what do you do if you&#x27;re only interested in making music but not performing?  You make the music, put it out with someone else&#x27;s name, they do the performance and bring in the $$ and you split it (or whatever your agreement is).<p>Now, competition might be more prevalent in other genres- but I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that in genres without significant competition, there is still no money to be made in sales.

this race to get jobs becomes more important than the actual lets educate our students,  Henderson said. Its not uncommon to encounter a 20-year-old who has not benefited from the maturation you get from higher education, from true engagement in a classroom  it becomes more about taking classes as an extended way to build your rsum. You think youre talking to a 20-year-old who should have bright ideas and enthusiasm, and they cant get out of the mode of: What are the words Im supposed to use in this conversation? And you see that the risk has been taken out of rsums  thats the part thats most disheartening.<p>I go to UPenn, and the pre-professionalism defines the school.  The students, especially those in Wharton, do almost nothing between the hours of 8am and 8pm that isn&#x27;t in some way connected to building a career.  I&#x27;m not condemning this attitude though, because it is productive and realistic.  In the modern economy students at Penn often come out with great jobs and a relatively secure future, and that&#x27;s very important.  I also can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m much above it, I put a ton of effort into finding internships and jobs.  I just wish there was some way to balance this with the &quot;Hollywood&quot; depiction of college where students sit around and engage each other in intellectual conversation for the sake of mental expansion.   I wish this was the type of where people don&#x27;t just join a handful of clubs/groups to build their resume, and where people don&#x27;t avoid interesting classes that might hurt their GPA.

Before the invention of the phonograph, people would bring instruments to parties and play music themselves. It took time for this tradition to die out.  Even in the 40&#x27;s movie theaters frequently showed sing-a-long shorts!  While recorded music has brought first-rate professional performances to the masses, it has robbed untold millions of musical expression.  How many of us learned to play some instrument or another as children, but never bothered to keep playing because we didn&#x27;t like the music we were taught to play and didn&#x27;t think we could ever play well enough to be worth listening to? Odds are most people reading this are much less musically accomplished than their great-great grandparents were.<p>For a substantial portion of the twentieth century, technological limitations made recording and distribution expensive. You could make a lot more money by promoting a star and making everyone want a small number of records than you could by recording everything under the sun! Some of those stars were just gifted amateurs who had mass appeal the moment they walked in from the wilds.  Those were rare enough that we soon learned how to manufacture stars, and the methods have reached a level of sophistication where musical talent isn&#x27;t even necessary anymore (see autotuning).<p>The internet has practically eliminated the costs and difficulty of distribution.  The moment you record something, you can send it to the other side of the planet almost instantaneously to as many people who are interested in it exist. Recording still takes some knowledge, but the equipment required to do professional quality recording is now easily accessible to hobbyists. Natural prodigies are still showing up now and then, and <i>stopping</i> them from recording great music would be more challenging than allowing them to do so!  It&#x27;s the manufactured star system that&#x27;s collapsing.  It costs a lot to do research on what should appeal to teenagers in a few years, hire professional writers to design songs matching your research results, hire somebody who looks good in a latex bikini to record those songs, shoot videos, etc., and finally have a team of professional audio engineers digitally massage her horrid caterwaulings into something that doesn&#x27;t sound horrible when blasted through iPod earbuds at top volume.<p>Manufactured music superstars are a dying breed, and good riddance. My playlist is devoid of them and full of gifted amateurs, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the change! The global musical monoculture is ending and a diverse, global party is replacing it. We are working towards the point where music can be created by anyone, anywhere, to be shared with everyone, everywhere.  Perhaps, as we listen to superstars less and to ordinary people more, the pressure to play like a superstar or not play at all will drop away and we&#x27;ll reclaim the tradition of participatory music that we&#x27;ve been robbed of.

This is the result of a CDN (Content Delivery Network) which specializes in caching images (or content as well, but let&#x27;s just focus on images at the moment) to a group of servers around the world, and then serving those images (or content) based on which server will get you the content fastest (likely the one geographically closest, though their could be others that are faster).<p>If you are just comparing the load time to your server, it could also be simple server caching, network speed (as in the connection from their servers to the network is faster than yours), etc. etc.<p>Larger sites need to focus on these things, your site probably doesn&#x27;t at this stage, but their are things you can do to speed up your site. I&#x27;ve never worked with a WP site, so I don&#x27;t know how the average site is structured, but you could server your images from Amazon S3, make sure your javascript is all minified and loaded at the right time, use image sprites for your non-content images (logo, buttons, design flourishes). Then their is the speed of your server, etc. etc.<p>The big thing to think about is, does your site need to be fast? Mashable et.al, benefit from a fast site because a quicker site (I believe) gets better results in Google PageRank, and is less likely that a person will leave if it doesn&#x27;t load quickly.<p>For your blog, people have likely come their for a reason, and can wait the 0.5-1 second time difference to Mashable. What may be a 1 reader difference for you, is a 1000+ reader difference for them. Therefore, for economic purposes, they NEED to be fast as part of their business.",1379297973

Not more carefully, mind you, but more slowly.",1379297276
6391218,comment,6389498,6390519,2,0,pdonis,,,"No, I&#x27;ve read the whole paper. I agree that he does describe a key difference between the search for redemption through literature and the search for redemption through philosophy or religion; he says:<p>&quot;[A] culture which has substituted literature for both religion and philosophy finds redemption neither in a non-cognitive relation to a non-human person nor in a cognitive relation to propositions, but in non-cognitive relations to other human beings... This sort of culture drops a presupposition common to religion and philosophythat redemption must come from ones relation to something that is not just one more human creation.&quot;<p>But if the point of this is to remove the need for redemptive truth, it doesn&#x27;t work; the search for redemption through literature still tries to fulfill &quot;the need that religion and philosophy have attempted to satisfy&quot;, it just tries to fulfill it without appealing to non-human entities:<p>&quot;For the Socratic idea of self-examination and self-knowledge, the literary intellectual substitutes the idea of enlarging the self by becoming acquainted with still more ways of being human. For the religious idea that a certain book or tradition might connect you up with a supremely powerful or supremely lovable non-human person, the literary intellectual substitutes the Bloomian thought that the more books you read, the more ways of being human you have considered, the more human you become...&quot;<p>Even at the one point where he does explicitly seem to say there is no redemptive truth...<p>&quot;To give up the idea that there is an intrinsic nature of reality to be discovered either by the priests, or the philosophers, or the scientists, is to disjoin the need for redemption from the search for universal agreement. It is to give up the search for an accurate account of human nature, and thus for a recipe for leading The Good Life for Man. Once these searches are given up, expanding the limits of the human imagination steps forward to assume the role that obedience to the divine will played in a religious culture, and the role that discovery of what is really real played in a philosophical culture.&quot;<p>...he follows up immediately with something that contradicts what he just said:<p>&quot;But this substitution is no reason to give up the search for a single utopian form of political life--the Good Global Society.&quot;<p>This is why I said that, although I understand where he&#x27;s coming from, I don&#x27;t agree with him. He claims to have &quot;deconstructed&quot; redemptive truth and put something better in its place; but all he&#x27;s really done is fasten on to his own particular brand of redemptive truth. His belief in the Good Global Society meets the definition of redemptive truth that I quoted, and he appears to think <i>that</i> is possible; so whether he realizes it or not, he does think a form of redemptive truth, as he defines it, is possible. And he&#x27;s wrong for the reason I gave: our lives are too complex for a &quot;single utopian form of political life&quot; to work.",1379297267

Forget about the crying thing, which makes it vivid and more interesting to read but might obscure the fundamental point, which is that <i>interviews make people incredibly uncomfortable</i>. Some of the calmest, most unflappable people I work with <i>shook visibly</i> in their interviews with us.<p>What&#x27;s important about that is: you are not getting an accurate read of a candidate&#x27;s state of mind in a high-stakes interview. I think you have just a couple of options to improve your accuracy given that fact:<p>* You can take deliberate steps to lower the stakes in your interview process by changing the kinds of transactions that happen in the interview (for instance, by constructing interviews that involve collaborating on a problem instead of challenging the candidate).<p>* You can &quot;discount&quot; the signals you get from the interview, particular w/r/t already nebulous concepts like &quot;confidence&quot;, &quot;social skill&quot;, &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, and the dreaded &quot;culture fit&quot;.<p>* You can push more of the recruiting process into situations where the candidate controls their environment (for instance, by doing stuff at home, and on a fixed but flexible time scale) and less on in-person timeboxed interviews.<p>I&#x27;d love more ideas. We&#x27;re trying all three, but it&#x27;s a lather-rinse-repeat kind of situation. I&#x27;m getting good, I think, at spotting signals that are probably the result of jitters.

I don't get it, yesterday there was another WebGL demo on HN and it did exactly the same thing. Is that something which we have to live with in the future ? Is WebGL going to be too much CPU intensive, so much that nobody is going to be able to run that ? Or is this 'demo' asking too much of WebGL ?",1325386760

SQL Server bypasses the Windows file system cache and will aggressively manage memory to keep frequently accessed data pages resident in RAM.

Most studies are conducted over large codebases over several years (IBM & Microsoft have spent a lot of time on this).  So, I can't actually prove it.<p>I have spent a lot of time dealing with it and I know what I'm most comfortable with.  And there are always exceptions.  I've worked with some really talented remote people -- oddly, they usually end up relocating eventually anyway because they want to.  I've also worked with some remote people that really think they're much better than they actually are.<p>Professionally, the least satisfying jobs for me are the ones where people clock in and clock out.  They may be very efficient, but I usually don't learn much from them and there's zero contact after we invariably go onto our next thing.<p>That's a long-winded way of saying you might be right and objectively team cohesion is overrated -- I really don't know.  Subjectively, I found I'm happier that way and I do my best work when satisfied.  I do believe it's resulted in higher quality products usually, too.  It's often the stuff you don't think about.  Like overhearing a couple colleagues discussing something and being able to interject and save them a couple days of frustration.  That stuff usually doesn't land in IRC, Basecamp, Skype, or whatever.<p>But if you've managed to make it work, awesome.  It's not my intention to combat the practice if it's working.

What really matters for concurrency is page latch, which is per 8K page.<p>In SQLite readers actually do block writers by default. Writing transactions are committed with lock escalation steps. First shared lock is acquired, then reserved, then pending and finally exclusive. Pending blocks new shared locks and waits until all in-flight shared locks are released.

3412452,comment,3410773,3410773,0,0,JoeDeveloper,,,"I have been working remotely for the past ~4 years and it has proven to be one of the most productive approaches for me.<p>I find that meeting many of the ""challenges"" of managing distributed teams end up being worth much more than just the ability to hire quicker and from a broader pool.<p>Distributed teams and asynchronous communication ( email, wiki, tickets ( and comments to them )) coupled with knowledge repositories ( such as internal stackoverflow clones etc ) allow formal, persistant capture and presentation of best-practices within the team, without a large upfront cost and 'documentation rot'.<p>Having to verbally explain something to each new member in turn strikes me as much less efficient than being able to point to written documentation and a centralized place to request information or clarification.<p>It also helps ensure that goals and approaches are actually captured clearly, rather than assumed based on nodding heads.<p>Tools like assembla.com ( full disclosure, I have done work for them ) and other team / project management offerings with integrated source control also serves to capture raw metrics to allow better estimations going forwards and better pinpointing of areas that need strengthening.<p>It is often said that adding new members to an existing project can extend the duration of the project, as experienced developers need to spend time on getting others up to speed than actually working on the deliverables themselves, by building this documentation into the process as a whole that cost can be amortized, shared across the team and contribute to knowledge transfer even among high-value members.<p>By embracing ticket based development, it means that people can continue working on something else if they come across blockers or are waiting on feedback for whatever they were working with before. It also means that developers can choose tasks that they find compelling or have otherwise non-obvious synergies with their background / recent tasks.<p>While working in that kind of environment I manage 55+ productive hours / week pretty easily, and with pleasure - as have many of the people that I have worked with, by virtue of minimal  administrative overhead and being able to 'stay in the flow' working on tasks in a self-directed manner within the context of goals for a particular iteration.<p>Capturing the value-add of developers via tickets ( though obviously imperfect ), tends to minimize social manipulation of managers in terms of who did what. The persistent record of ticket comments, code review input, code commits, and other exchanges works to increase transparency - accountability and value can have a firmer ground to be evaluated.<p>The biggest problem that I find with preferring to work as a telecommuter is how few companies seem to be open to hiring under those conditions. I have had offers where the only sticking point was that I needed to relocate to New York, or California, or Amsterdam, or Brisbane, or Singapore .. etc. They are all great places, or well, fine places at least, but I am pretty content being surrounded by rice fields and having chanting monks strolling by now and then.<p>If you could use a telecommuting fullstack / JS Engineer - let me know :)",1325384059

When I set up a project and on-board remote developers, the first thing I do is tell everyone, no video conferencing for a week. I do this to play a game, I then get the team together after a week and we play a game of describe your coworker. Of course hilarity ensues, as everyone build these crazy visualizations of what their other remote development counterparts look like, sometimes we will have the artists among the team sketch out the visualization on a shared screen. I also open a group chat on Skype for the project, where I kick of casual office conversation, I will usually post some interesting tech articles and kick up a discussion. From there the team dynamics tend to start growing organically. Sure these things may start organically in an office setting with no effort at all, but it does not take that much effort to seed it among an all remote team. Further some of the more introverted members of the team have expressed that they really like it because they feel more comfortable with the introductory exchanges not being face to face. I am a big proponent of remote teams, I can't say that I always was. I used to believe that they would never work because the team dynamic would not form. I was wrong and don't mind admitting that after being part of many teams that have resoundingly proved that my assumptions where wrong. Some of the most efficient teams that I have been on where all remote.",1325383687

As long as the patch gives it a clean interface and meets the Linux kernel's standards, I don't see any major roadblock.<p>I don't, however, think that the magic early-boot changes to prompt for a passphrase almost immediately after boot would have much chance.  And I don't really see the point of that compared to the usual mechanism of prompting for a passphrase from the initramfs before mounting encrypted partitions.  Either way means that you have key material very briefly in memory before ending up in CPU registers, and thus that you must very carefully wipe that key material from memory before proceeding.<p>Looking at their patch, it would need a major overhaul to become suitable for acceptance into the Linux kernel.  They've also re-implemented sha256 themselves rather than using the kernel's existing implementation, and they've used that sha256 implementation for a very simplistic key derivation function (2000 iterations of sha256 directly on the passphrase itself).",1325383482

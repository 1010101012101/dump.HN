Once you take into account payroll, sales, and sundry other taxes that people pay (many of which are pretty regressive), the system becomes much less progressive (it's still slightly progressive as a whole, but much less so than conservatives like to cast it).",1313384302

I know, it's strange to say that it's a <i>problem</i> if it isn't coercive, and I'd agree that many of the inefficiencies of government stem from the coercive nature of taxes (no need to convince people to give you money if you can just take it by force).  But I'm really a moderate in all of this - I personally don't think a modern state can survive on donations, or a ""pay only if you think the government will do a good job with the money"" tax code.  We're gonna have to collect some taxes, rich people (in my opinion) should pay more than poor people, and there's no way people, rich or poor, are just going to pony up out of a deep affection and fondness for the federal government.<p>If tax rates are going to be paid and progressive (they actually aren't), then they'll have to be coercive.  I think what Mr. Buffet is arguing here is that the rich need to be coerced into paying more in taxes than they currently do.

The concerns my client had with suscription model was if the provider would still exist and provide same service in a year, or in five years for that matter. The amount of time they had to invest for the PoS (which was with inventory management) needed to be secured. They were okay with phasing in the inventory over a long period (it was a specialty store with a huge inventory) given the system didn't rely on being functional if only it knew the inventory - as long as the time investment couldn't be lost. Should the PoS provider go bankrupt or otherwise stop the service they wanted to be sure their effort time-wise wasn't worthless and could be ported somewhere else. Contracts with a minimum binding periods was okay as long as it didn't mean the time they used the system couldn't benefit them elsewhere.<p>Someone pointed out that the robustness wasn't a deal-breaker because you could revert to handwriting receipts. It's true that you can just do that but the point about PoS isn't just that it's slightly more effective than a calculator that can print out receipts for customers. A PoS grants valuable data. Even older cash-registers have data capabilities such as who the salesperson was and time of purchase. 
If you can provide great analytic tools for the data it has gathered, that'll be a major improvement of many available PoS systems.<p>But store owners also care about stability very much. If the system doesn't work when there's internet shortage they won't be happy. No electricity is probably only acceptable factor when it comes to having a PoS on a computer.
If the system is slow and customers are waiting because there's unstable internet they will also be dissatisfied. Debit card processing all goes over the internet and when it's slow customers have bad experiences but at least they know it's because the internet is messing up and some ISP probably is to blame. If the cash-register is screwing it up they will blame the store.<p>I've worked in a store for a couple of years as a sales person so if you have more questions I'd be happy to help.

2885414,comment,2884810,2884810,2,0,udfalkso,,,"tl;dr<p>""What science is, I think, may be something like this: There was on this planet an evolution of life to a stage that there were evolved animals, which are intelligent. I don't mean just human beings, but animals which play and which can learn something from experience--like cats. But at this stage each animal would have to learn from its own experience. They gradually develop, until some animal [primates?] could learn from experience more rapidly and could even learn from anothers experience by watching, or one could show the other, or he saw what the other one did. So there came a possibility that all might learn it, but the transmission was inefficient and they would die, and maybe the one who learned it died, too, before he could pass it on to others.<p>The question is: is it possible to learn more rapidly what somebody learned from some accident than the rate at which the thing is being forgotten, either because of bad memory or because of the death of the learner or inventors?<p>So there came a time, perhaps, when for some species [humans?] the rate at which learning was increased, reached such a pitch that suddenly a completely new thing happened: things could be learned by one individual animal, passed on to another, and another fast enough that it was not lost to the race. Thus became possible an accumulation of knowledge of the race.<p>This has been called time-binding. I don't know who first called it this. At any rate, we have here [in this hall] some samples of those animals, sitting here trying to bind one experience to another, each one trying to learn from the other.<p>This phenomenon of having a memory for the race, of having an accumulated knowledge passable from one generation to another, was new in the world--but it had a disease in it: it was possible to pass on ideas which were not profitable for the race. The race has ideas, but they are not necessarily profitable.<p>So there came a time in which the ideas, although accumulated very slowly, were all accumulations not only of practical and useful things, but great accumulations of all types of prejudices, and strange and odd beliefs.<p>Then a way of avoiding the disease was discovered. This is to doubt that what is being passed from the past is in fact true, and to try to find out ab initio again from experience what the situation is, rather than trusting the experience of the past in the form in which it is passed down. And that is what science is: the result of the discovery that it is worthwhile rechecking by new direct experience, and not necessarily trusting the [human] race['s] experience from the past. I see it that way. That is my best definition.""<p>. . .<p>""I can also define science another way: Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.""",1313381570

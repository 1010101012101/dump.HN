It&#x27;s weak though.<p>> From my limited uses of it, if you chat with a single person, you can&#x27;t create a new chat with that person around a different topic.<p>AFAICT, this is correct. If you try to make a group chat with only one person, it will just open the existing chat that you have open with that person.<p>> In hangouts, how do I easily see the files that have been sent?<p>I honestly have no idea. whenever I&#x27;ve needed to send a file to someone over hangouts, I share a dropbox link.<p>> Also, how do I star a comment?

It also deliberately demoted rivals.<p>>For example, the FTC staff noted that Google presented results from its flight-search tool ahead of other travel sites, even though Google offered fewer flight options. Google’s shopping results were ranked above rival comparison-shopping engines, even though users didn’t click on them at the same rate, the staff found. Many of the ways Google boosted its own results have not been previously disclosed.<p>>One way Google favored its own results was to change its ranking criteria. Google typically ranks sites based on measures like the number of links that point to a site, or how often users click on the site in search results.<p>>But Marissa Mayer, who was then a Google vice president, said Google didn’t use click-through rates to determine the ranking for its own specialized-search sites, because they would rank too low, according to the staff report<p>>Instead, Google would “automatically boost” its own sites for certain specialized searches that otherwise would favor rivals, the FTC found. If a comparison-shopping site was supposed to rank highly, Google Product Search was placed above it. When Yelp was deemed relevant to a user’s search query, Google Local would pop up on top of the results page, the staff wrote.<p>>Other regulators have found similar practices. European antitrust authorities in 2013 said Google had a different, “specialized” search algorithm for ranking its own content.<p>>To bolster its own listings, Google sometimes copied, or “scraped,” information from rival sites. According to the FTC report, Google copied Amazon’s rankings of how well products were selling, then used that information to rank its results for product searches. Amazon declined to comment.<p>>While Google promoted its own results, it sometimes demoted rivals, the FTC staff found. For example, Google compiled a list of comparison-shopping sites and “demoted them from the top 10 web results,” staff wrote. According to the report, Google users in tests didn’t like the changes; only after Google tweaked its search algorithm at least four times, and changed the ranking criteria, did the new results get “slightly positive” feedback, the staff said.<p>>Google’s efforts paid off, the FTC found. It said Google’s maneuvers reduced Web traffic to rivals, and increased traffic to Google sites.",1454363970

11015848,comment,11014268,11014742,0,0,cyphar,,,"> Before 2005 the Linux kernel was managed by BitKeeper, then Git happened and took over the world. The free software folks that were criticizing the usage of BitKeeper for the Linux kernel weren&#x27;t able to offer alternatives, whereas Git was born from the hands of the same pragmatists that were using BitKeeper.<p>Yes, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s a benefit of proprietary software. Before bitkeeper there was some Sun version control system that had a very similar model to git (which might&#x27;ve been released with the OpenSolaris thing, I&#x27;m not sure). The point is that &quot;you got some free software because of proprietary software&quot; is not relevant. Free software<p>> Linux itself, along with the GNU toolchain, happened after Multics, Unix, 80386 and MINIX. Well OK, the GNU project was started before 80386, but nevertheless it was started as a clone of Unix. You can see that from its recursive name.<p>GNU is a free software replacement for UNIX. You could argue &quot;clone&quot; and &quot;replacement&quot; are the same thing, but I&#x27;d argue the intention is different.<p>> Or in other words, sometimes what you call proprietary software also represents innovation that can be copied and innovated upon should the need arise.<p>Except you can&#x27;t copy proprietary software due to software patents and a miriad of other &quot;protections&quot; that are designed to mistreat users. People make free software alternatives to proprietary software because they want people to have access to technology without losing their freedom.<p>> Free Software activists sometimes make it sound like the whole movement has been a liberation effort, which is far from the truth, as most open-source software has been development for profit or for fun, having nothing to do with ideals.<p>The free software movement has always been about freedom. The main advocates of the open source movement have always tried to ignore the freedom aspects (in particular, Eric S. Raymond who is a very unpleasant character). However, many people in the open source movement actually do care about freedom if you explain the free software movement to them. The fact that the &quot;open source movement has won&quot; is very sad because it will raise generations of programmers who will gladly give up their freedom for no reason.<p>> > if we want to see a world in which users can control their computers<p>> If we want to see that world happening, we must first ensure that the people building software can earn a decent living, because frankly, we deserve it. I mean, first come up with business models that work. And do note that there has been room for a single Red Hat.<p>SUSE has offerings in the same space (disclaimer: I work for SUSE).<p>> Ideally people would recognize how much software is worth and pay even for free software. In practice people are pirating the shit out of everything and install ad-blockers while feeling morally justified in doing so. Therefore while I find closed platforms abhorrent, I can&#x27;t help but think that it&#x27;s a justified overreaction of the software industry when faced with hordes of self-entitled assholes.<p>People do pay for free software (myself included). However, the primary funding model in free software cannot be &quot;for the actual software&quot; because that wouldn&#x27;t work. You need to have a new business model with free software<p>> But that aside, having users control their computers is not the primary motivation by which open source / free software gets built.<p>I disagree. Many large free software projects (FFmpeg, VLC, all of GNU, Debian) refer to themselves as &quot;free software&quot;. This isn&#x27;t a typo, it&#x27;s because they care about software freedom and were started to offer free software alternatives to users like myself. There are many, many more smaller free software projects which do the same. While it is true that some developers don&#x27;t care about free software and work on free software projects, that&#x27;s like an author claiming that they don&#x27;t care about freedom of speech while writing satire about a politician. There&#x27;s a disconnect in that logic, and we should recognise the innovation that free software is.",1454363937

But why should I have to? I certainly don&#x27;t enjoy it.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t have to; but Open Source projects tend to be (with good reason) wary of using closed-source products like Slack. You can&#x27;t foresee what the needs of an open source project will be in 10 years, or whether Slack will still be around then. Should something happen to Slack (they go under / get purchased / decide to terminate non-paid accounts / whatever), you&#x27;ll be relying on their APIs and service to recover your data and maybe migrate it to a new platform. They can make all the promises they want today, but who knows what their business looks like in a decade.<p>Anyone remember SourceForge? GitHub is at least just a set of management tools / interfaces on top of a relatively vanilla Git repository (and Git is open source). Ideally, someone would build a web-based IRC client with all this functionality integrated and call it a day - though I suspect that&#x27;s how Slack got started, and the restrictions they have are just so they can make some money from selling their product.<p>I mean, you need 4 pieces of information to connect to an IRC server: Server name, port, a username, and the #channel name you want to join (most IRC networks provide user and channel registration services via &quot;admin&quot; bots).",1454363921

It&#x27;s not about <i>who you tell</i>.  It&#x27;s about <i>who you&#x27;re criticizing</i>.  Red Hat is not the one making these comments.  If you condone a company summarily removing a project leader you don&#x27;t like, then you also condone a company summarily removing a project leader you do like.  That doesn&#x27;t end well.  In fact, I could name projects on which I feel Red Hat has forced their will on upstream entirely too much, to the detriment of both.  It&#x27;s not the way a meritocratic community is supposed to work.  I think in general it&#x27;s better to let technical communities deal with their own issues, and in general Red Hat is wise enough to recognize that.<p>Believe me, I know where you&#x27;re coming from.  I almost didn&#x27;t join Red Hat myself because of people like Ulrich Drepper (who was still there) and Al Viro (who would even have been in my group).  I understand the sentiment.

Your dogmatic stance on &quot;I am completely opposed to editing messages after they are sent (chat is append only!)&quot; is a good example of how open source is failing corporate user. I typo things all the time and want to be able to edit them, and don&#x27;t care about your philosophical objections.<p>You can try to bludgeon and guilt people into using open source tools, but the problem is fundamentally that the tools that are Open Source are /failing/ a set of users.  If you fixed the tools and ran HipChat and Slack out of business with Open Source competition, we wouldn&#x27;t even be having this discussion.  Lecturing people about Freedom(tm) and &quot;Devsplaining&quot; to users why they don&#x27;t want the features they tell you they want isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>If you want people to get off of Slack write an Open Source alternative that Slack users will freely choose to use instead.

This watch launched at $250 and while I really liked the look and idea of it, it was still a bit more than I wanted to pay for a cool gadget that I didn&#x27;t really need.<p>A few months after launch I snagged one on sale for $175 and I quite enjoy it (although not necessarily for the reasons I originally expected to).<p>My experience:  it&#x27;s nothing groundbreaking like your first (or latest) smartphone because it&#x27;s largely just an extension of that smartphone.  I don&#x27;t really run too many watch-specific applications and mostly use it for quick notifications/replies and the occasional case where having a control on my wrist is nicer than messing with my phone.<p>One example of that would be navigation while riding my motorcycle.  I don&#x27;t have a phone charger/mount but I can fire up nav before leaving and glance down at my watch to see upcoming turns.  It can also be nice as a remote for my phone&#x27;s camera or to pause something I&#x27;m casting to the TV like a Netflix show.<p>Honestly my main, favorite thing about this watch is the ability to change the face to look like just about anything I want.  I never would&#x27;ve guessed this at first but this is my stupidly obvious killer app (or at least the most enjoyable).  There are several great watch faces for free or cheap on the Play Store and thousands of them available for download and application through apps like Watchmaker.<p>The fact that this is just a programmable screen means you can make it look like a subtle, classy &quot;traditional&quot; watch or you can do things not possible on traditional jewelry.  If I felt like it I could swap between a long list of favorites to match whatever I&#x27;m doing or even what I&#x27;m wearing.  Granted I&#x27;m not quite that obsessed with fashion or anything but it&#x27;s a surprisingly cool thing to have.<p>And since I enjoy playing around in Photoshop and Illustrator, I can create my own interactive watch faces with no programming skill required.  Watchmaker and other apps allow you to create each element from the background to the hands or dials or readouts or buttons and tie them to variables like time, date, battery, location, or even the orientation of the watch in space.<p>It&#x27;s totally a geeky bit of tinkering that not everyone would enjoy but again, there are thousands of great ones out there made and shared by people who are into that sort of thing.  Granted there are plenty of shitty &quot;brand&quot; watch knockoff faces and ugly amateurish stuff but that&#x27;s the nature of user-generated designs.<p>So yeah, for $150-250, if you&#x27;re a gadget fan and have the dough to spend on something that&#x27;s mostly just pretty neat but not necessary, I think these sorts of watches are great.  If the idea of putting it on a cradle on the nightstand every night turns you off or you would never spend that much on any watch, maybe it&#x27;s not a great idea.<p>I doubt that I would spend the $400-500+ I&#x27;ve seen other smart watches going for because there&#x27;s only so much I&#x27;d pay for a smartphone extender with custom display but in the $150-250 range it&#x27;s pretty sweet.",1454363596

If you were writing a replacement it seems like it would be one of your first considerations to make each statement scope limited to the scope of the declaration. I mean, that is what auto is effectively doing in C++ nowadays - you have to evaluate the whole statement to resolve what auto is supposed to be at compile time.<p>I would take consistency of using postfix typing as a sign there is legitimacy and simplicity in compiler design to do so, but I don&#x27;t think the Python example is particularly fair, since it (and the C++ ->) are both extending a language that already had declaration syntax and thus the kind of glyphic overhead imposed by colons and arrows is less condemnable because they had to maintain backwards compatibility.<p>My gripe boils down to the difference between &quot;August 5th&quot; and &quot;5th of August&quot;. The latter can convey the information in a more meaingful sense (you usually care about the day more than the month if you are using both) but it comes with a grammatical overhead &quot;of&quot; that, if were writing and reading a <i>lot</i> of dates of this form, would have a tangible impact on overall reading and writing efficiency.

This happens a lot with oligopolies, too. Yet, there has been evidence that some of them collude in secret often through intermediaries to expedite this process. You usually see this with lobbyists but sometimes outright scandals like RAM price-fixing. So, coincident interests doesn&#x27;t auto-eliminate possibility of a conspiratorial explanation but certainly should be the <i>default</i> belief for scheming, self-interested behavior.<p>&quot;The government spraying massive amounts of chemicals from airplanes to do...stuff...is hardly a compelling reason.&quot;<p>I smirked at the wording. The amount of mythology around chemtrails mostly makes it a good example. Yet, you&#x27;re off the mark on this one just as they are.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray</a><p>So, you can replace &quot;stuff&quot; with testing of bio-weapon systems and studies of disease impact on unwitting subjects with legal immunity. Not sure if any of the chemtrail claims or evidence overlapped with that as I didn&#x27;t research it much. Yet, it&#x27;s a fact that the U.S. military secretly (for a while) flew planes over U.S. cities that doused them with both chemicals and biological agents to support our biological and chemical weapons capabilities. There were many groups involved in that. They even blocked further investigation of all the incidents and those effected. So, we know what&#x27;s revealed is a fraction of what went on but I&#x27;m not going to speculate size of that fraction. I just know there&#x27;s more.<p>This brings me to another facet of the problem: supporting irrational stuff with rational stuff. The fact that certain conspiracies and lies happened before seem to increase the likelihood people will believe a similar claim. &quot;Of course they&#x27;re doing chemtrails on us: remember Sea-Spray!? Why wouldn&#x27;t they still be doing it?&quot; That doesn&#x27;t logically follow but does in many people&#x27;s minds. Hell, it often does in reality so much we have the meme that &quot;History Repeats.&quot; I think allowing recurring and similar rogue behavior in industry and governments plants many seeds for other, false beliefs to show up. Another reason to put an end to any schemes we identify. Affects signal-to-noise ratio of our ability to detect sneakier schemes.<p>Good news is the biggest bullshiters in conspiracy claims are usually <i>really</i> full of shit. Obviously.

Right now, you have a neat chat tool. Maybe in 10 years, you have a problem where Slack has a monopoly on all project chats, and abuses that power.<p>Today, you can look and see &quot;Hey, Slack is a cool company. They get it. This isn&#x27;t Microsoft of the 90&#x27;s. They aren&#x27;t going to abuse this power, they just want to make an amazing chat tool that improves all of our lives.&quot; (This is probably true) So it seems like it&#x27;s ok to use Slack. The idea is that maybe this power corrupts eventually. Or maybe Slack as an entity may not always be run by people who get it. Maybe it&#x27;s broken up into parts, or becomes a hollow shell as a holding company (<i>cough</i> Yahoo). Without an open platform and free source code, users are unable to move away.<p>The dogma is a rule that brings the potential long-term consequences to you when you&#x27;re deciding what to do now. It gives you a twinge &quot;Hmm, that feels dirty because it&#x27;s proprietary. I&#x27;ll keep looking&quot;. That way you don&#x27;t have to imagine how Slack gets from Cool Company to Abusive Monopoly, you can just make an easy choice based on how you feel.",1454363035

My classmates were largely representative of the top 30% of my high school - people who are either gifted with raw intelligence, or who do well by working hard. My school had good sports teams, and the student body spent a lot of time and effort cheering for the teams, partying, and generally having a good time. I certainly enjoyed myself, though the academic standards were so lax that I was able to pass an entire semester where I attended no classes other than the exams. There are a lot of people who just aren&#x27;t interested in the academic side of school.<p>Some years later, I went to a much more prestigious school for my MBA. This school didn&#x27;t really have an athletic department (as a Division III school they were not allowed to issue athletic scholarships) and the student body as a whole was both smart <i>and</i> hard-working. I mean, sure, they drank their share too -- but learning was considered cool and group projects (while drinking, of course!) were a perfectly acceptable way to spend a Friday or Saturday night.<p>That attitude is infectious and it sticks with you. Once there is positive peer pressure to learn, suddenly everyone becomes invested in everyone else&#x27;s success. You go from &quot;I heard that class was an easy A so I&#x27;m gonna take it&quot; to &quot;I think that class looks really interesting.

This confirms something I&#x27;ve suspected for a while, which is that elite colleges matter immensely if you don&#x27;t study STEM.<p>You could turn this into a different question - is the value of an elite college that it allows you to major in something other than STEM?  And maybe one step further - if elite colleges differentiate themselves from other colleges through the prospects they offer non-STEM students, does that mean it may be rational for very elite students to avoid STEM, which serves as an equalizer?<p>I have noticed this anecdotally by observing the prospects of strong students who went to good but not elite schools.  You could be a very strong international relations student from a mid-tier UC (say, UC Davis or UCSD), but your prospects really won&#x27;t be as good as they would be if you&#x27;d gone to Yale.  It isn&#x27;t game over, but Yale is a huge boost.  But if you major in CS, they will be the same…<p>… or will they?  There certainly is still a difference in kind, just not one that is as readily apparent to people who see a bunch of squiggles, symbols, and text flashing by on a screen.  There is an easily observed difference between being a the director of the American Music Heritage foundation (an invented title and organization) at $130k a year and a senior crud bug fixer for $130k a year.  But these differences exist within tech as well.  An interesting data science position where you have a lot of autonomy is a very different life from checking in with the scrum team every morning to talk about whether you&#x27;ve figured out why the config file changes are making the computer say &quot;ERRNO 63: gcc header updater missing&quot;, even if they both pay the same.<p>Do elite colleges lead to a hidden difference in kind within the tech field, similar to what is observable outside of tech?",1454362714

It was just a 30 second quip, a mere nugget falling from the ingot which was the lecture. This won&#x27;t do it justice but to paraphrase him he basically said (w/r/t Shenzhen where effectively every retailer is selling a commodity, eventually they bottom out in price-competition) - the way that merchants differentiate themselves is via being &quot;the guy&quot; who can provide services in a reliable fashion. He goes to the same guy every time to pick up his 10k spools of resistors to throw into the pick&#x27;n&#x27;place even if its a few cents more on the bottom-line to the BOM[1] because he has developed a relationship and reputation with those vendors. I&#x27;ve had some catastrophic failures with Rackspace but even with proof of concepts with one tiny 400/mo box[0] they spent easily 12-15 hours with high-level engineers to help resolve some pretty obscure WAS stuff. I&#x27;m pretty sure they ended up bringing in software guys to help, or those Rackspace IT guys had some of the most in-depth <i>and</i> wide-range knowledge I&#x27;ve only seen in people like Brad Fitzpatrick[2]. They really went above and beyond - which is why I don&#x27;t mind paying 4x what an OVH box might cost.<p>There are so many shitty engineers, shitty lawyers, shitty automotive mechanics, doctors and hosts out there that your market differentiation can literally be phrased in a sentence: &quot;Be just a little bit more competent & reliable than your lazy competition&quot;.

His IT partner didn&#x27;t have much WebSphere experience so he brought me in, gave me the company card and asked me to get it to work<p>[1] Even the high priced merchants in Shenzhen are significantly cheaper than what we get at Digi-key and Mouser :(<p>[2] In that, you&#x27;d be very hard pressed to find an engineer who can code &quot;high level Perl&quot; (it was as high level as web-apps went during the LiveJournal days), could write Memcached, could write kernel patches for network drivers, do UI (though things were admittedly far more simple then), all the while taking care of the physical IT ops (see: Coders at Work, for a fantastic account)<p>[3] And any client you have who doesn&#x27;t recognize this, you should choose to fire as soon as possible.

The closest examples we have in the real world are forms of life which are incredibly power-hungry, fragile and prone to mutation. The more complex life is, it appears, the more fragile it becomes, so I would assume this would apply to probes as well, since they would essentially be life. It&#x27;s entirely possible that, even if such probes exist, they inevitably fail due to entropy, inefficiency or lack of a stable source of fuel/replication mass over a few generations.<p>Not every civilization capable of trying may retain such technological capability forever, either. Even if attempting the trick is relatively rare in the life cycle of civilizations, those that can may not care to do so within the window of their capabilities. You could just as well argue that it&#x27;s not possible for a civilization exactly as advanced as our own to prevent the launch of a deadly bioweapon which leads to their extinction.

11015480,comment,11013733,11013733,0,0,ewindisch,,,"Running a hosting business is hard work, I did it for over 10 years. It&#x27;s under-appreciated, users complain about everything, nobody wants to trust you, and many of the customers you do remain want to bleed your support dry. Some of the most successful hosting companies have succeeded by eliminating SLAs and making support hard to reach. Others such as Rackspace make support easy to get, but make sure the customers pay for the privilege. All of the problems with trying to start a hosting company are clear from the responses here.<p>One of the problems in this space is that it&#x27;s a mature market. Developers are accustomed to Amazon, Digital Ocean, Linode, Azure, and GCE. These are mature products and yes, users are skeptical of new entrants that don&#x27;t do as much, don&#x27;t have a complete product, or even have put effort into their website. For HackerNews, it&#x27;s ironic, but clearly this audience is expecting a mature product not a lean approach. (Self-provisioning while now industry-standard requires a significant effort to prevent fraud & abuse, and slow-provisioning is completely in-line with Lean methodologies)<p>So, some advice:<p>* Don&#x27;t give up just because of the bad feedback. Iterate!<p>* Focusing on devs is probably wrong if you don&#x27;t have a plan to leverage individual sales to enterprise sales. Individuals pay less and you need more of them. More customers usually equals more support, they&#x27;re more fickle, and less likely to be retained. Perhaps surprisingly, they&#x27;re also traditionally seasonal, with dev-based buy-in being strongest during summer.<p>* Find a hook. Something you do better, or different. For my hosting company, it was virtual servers for only $6/mo, when at the time the lowest priced alternative was $20/mo. We adopted an architecture that allowed us to radically compete on price. It doesn&#x27;t have to be price, and honestly, it&#x27;s better that it&#x27;s not. Also make sure the hook is understood by the market, one of my company&#x27;s problems was that our low price had us compared to shared hosting or container-based solutions, because virtual servers at that price was too unbelievable.<p>* Hack trust. Some people here mention trust. Now, I think this is over-valued. People put data with companies they really don&#x27;t know much about all the time. At some point, nobody knew who Dropbox, Docker, or Digital Ocean were. If, however, this proves to be a problem - and it could be in the current surveillance state - then look at ways to hack trust. For instance, a service such as AWS Lambda has a different threat (and trust) model than EC2, based solely on how developers use these products. If you stick with VM-based hosting, then develop partnerships, get reference customers, bring on staff that the community already knows, loves, and trusts.<p>Good luck!",1454361094

I&#x27;d look at how people describe their systems, small pieces and large parts, then try to map that to appropriate language statements.<p>Far as what you&#x27;re describing, I just go with something that worked in the past and was easy to pick up. As a start at least.<p>Re existing constructs<p>I&#x27;m not sure about that as a local maxima. Have you ever looked at the totality of languages, design styles, paradigms, and so on? Im not sure how much more they&#x27;re going to come up with that&#x27;s substantially different. Most of what&#x27;s out there condenses into a small number of categories. Picking easy, most effective stuff from those approaches a global maxima rather than a local one.<p>For example, the languages of various paradigms all compile to 3GL&#x27;s or assembly. Many can be integrated in varying ways. So, we can actually run parallel beginning where we start with BASIC-like 3GL, integrate a front end like Scratch, do a R-like skin for another crowd, something mathematical in notation for that type, and so on. Eventually, a number of people will start to converge on one or more.<p>Meanwhile, an easy 3GL can get us started on various software constructs and techniques just because it&#x27;s easy to pick up. Plus, results will be more applicable to a 3GL-dominated market.",1454360494

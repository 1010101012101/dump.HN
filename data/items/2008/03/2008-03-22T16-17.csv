That's true, and it's really fascinating.</i><p>That was indeed the idea behind my previous post. Rather the same thing happens with humans only changing teeth once a lifetime instead of continuously. There is some evidence that changing once doesn't give us an evolutionary advantage, but is simply a leftover from some ancestor's trait way back. (I'll see if I can find the reference).<p>I'm not saying that humans might not need their sleep (we die if we are sleep deprived), but that, based on the fact that we sleep, you can't claim that sleeping creatures have an advantage over hypothetical non-sleeping creatures. Maybe it's just something that stuck and doesn't do enough harm to kill us all out.",1206204355

143381,comment,143103,143324,0,0,SirWart,,,"The sentence may be a little ill-formed, but the general point is true. There are genes like the ones that cause Tay Sachs disease and sickle cell anemia, that have genetic advantages, like resistance to TB or malaria. But in the absence of the selecting force, such as with modern day medicine, the frequency of those genes in populations decrease over generations, which is the definition of evolution.
Sleeping seems like a huge disadvantage over a creature that could stay active and hunt 24 hours a day^, but if there were no selective force for creatures that sleep, creatures would evolve that don't require sleep pretty quickly. I'm not sure how fast, but the change would be observable over a couple of generations.<p>^(This advantage is not necessarily true in all cases. Bears sleep because it's not energy efficient to forage in the winter, humans may have evolved sleep as a way to save energy during the night because electric lighting became popular. However, I really doubt this hypothesis because of the number of critical functions that degrade under sleep, as well as the increased risk of heart problems from people who don't sleep a lot, which is really independent of whether you feel tired or not.)<p>On an unrelated note, how do you escape asterisks?",1206203591
143380,comment,142836,142836,0,0,walterk,,,"Without a doubt, Heidegger's explanation of readiness-to-hand in Being and Time has done more for my usability and process inefficiency evaluating skills than even Don Norman's Design of Everyday Things or any HCI book I've ever read.  While Norman's book comes in a strong second, the benefit of the first few chapters of Being and Time is the incredibly low-level cognitive access it gives you to the work your brain does when engaged in a task.  (If you're interested and don't mind slogging through some tough writing, pick up the hardcover version and Dreyfus' Being-in-the-World and read them together.  Reading a Wikipedia article or some other summary fails to deliver the same degree of low-level access.)<p>I'll also mention Ayn Rand as someone who wrote inspiringly about the entrepreneur as a (potentially) heroic figure, but hasten to add that her sociology of looters and movers is way too simplistic to ground some of her views on ethics.<p>John Stuart Mill's ""Utilitarianism"" was my first assigned reading in a political philosophy class, and remains my favorite.<p>Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals prompted me to question whether the values I had always held were really all that valuable.<p>Eleanor Rosch's work on basic categories and prototype theory (without which Lakoff's Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things--not to mention Weinberger's Everything is Miscellaneous--would likely not have been written) is fantastic, debunking empirically the Aristotelian theory of categories as being defined by necessary and sufficient conditions (they can be, where we intentionally define them to be from a top-down point of view, as in geometry, but bottom-up the construction of categories is much looser and based on family resemblances with one or several prototypes serving as the central point of comparison: hence, when I say ""bird"" you're more likely to think of a bluebird-type bird than a penguin or an ostrich).  Knowing this does a lot to help loosen up your understanding of things, which can become rigidified by traditional mathematical, scientific, and analytic philosophical education.<p>Several others worth mentioning, but I've got to get back to work!",1206203521

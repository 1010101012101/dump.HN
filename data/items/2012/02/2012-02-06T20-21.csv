We found that most people were able to perceive lag in the 30ms range, and so this post is correct when it says that.  However, I was able to recognize lag down to around 15ms.  (We did double blind tests and you had to indicate when you saw lag, not all of the events were lagging.  It was pretty accurate, but this was a test for some gaming software and so the results weren't published.)<p>I perceive no lag in the Mac OS X mouse.  I am very sensitive to it.  I'm able to perceive the flicker in fluorescent bulbs, yet I do not see any lag in the mouse.<p>I think if he's seeing 32ms, it is some particular combination of hardware and software.<p>I've tested this again with my trackpad and my cheap logiteck trackball.

3559112,comment,3558618,3558618,4,0,shadowfiend,,,"This is really an extension of the advice to make sure you build a product that scratches an itch you have. Extend it to developing frameworks, and you have suffering-oriented programming.<p>Of course, the real problem is that there are certain spaces that wouldn't really be serviced if that's all we did. Education is an excellent example: the people who really feel the pains of education, students, won't really start having the ability to help solve those pains until they're further along in their education, at which point the earlier pains don't necessarily apply as well. In a similar vein, learning to program is a problem that's been on the map for a long time, and, while the situation is constantly improving, we're dealing with the problem of, by the time we've got the skills to really help solve it, we've already learned to program, and have lost some amount of sight of how learning could be improved, because we're no longer in the proverbial trenches.<p>So while scratch a personal itch is awesome advice, and almost certainly helps in product development and framework development, sometimes it isn't enough. Sometimes just following your curiosity or intuition and exploring a space that doesn't produce regular hurt for you can lead to an equally good result. At that point, what you need to make sure you have is external feedback from the people whose itch you're trying to scratch. Maybe the chances of failure are greater in these cases, but the opportunities for success are also probably greater.",1328561188

3559108,comment,3557247,3557590,16,0,AshleysBrain,,,"IMO a more likely answer: 32ms / 2 = 16ms, the typical frame time for a monitor running at 60 Hz.  Also the post noted disabling QuartzExtreme (GPU accelerated rendering) fixed the issue.  I suppose the mouse cursor is drawn with GPU acceleration.  Then, to optimise rendering, the window system uses double buffering (a common technique) - however, double-buffering has the well-known side-effect of introducing a one frame delay.  So it would take 16ms to see your mouse cursor update, but with double buffering it takes 32ms.<p>I think Windows uses a special graphics card feature (an ""overlay"" IIRC) to update the mouse cursor independently of the double buffered window system.  I noticed moving windows became ever so slightly more laggy going from XP to Vista - probably because the window system became GPU accelerated.",1328561144
3559107,comment,3558056,3558512,1,0,Zancarius,,,"> Everyone hates change and would love to go back, until they actually do go back. The status quo is familiar and therefore seems more efficient. It's ""muscle memory"". The current desktop system is a metaphor that never really played out.<p>This is largely quite true. I was probably one of the few people among my peers who actually appreciated the new taskbar introduced in Windows 7. Although that's not to say that criticism of Windows 8 isn't important; I think one of the things Microsoft <i>did</i> learn with the Windows 7 betas and release candidates was that feedback from the user base can very occasionally be helpful. In some exceptional cases, monitoring user feedback can short-circuit certain disaster.<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that change for the sake of change isn't always good--and likewise, it isn't always bad. Paradigm shifts will happen, things will change, and sometimes legacy designs will continue to persist for wont of familiarity. What I'm saying is this: Changing <i>too</i> much too drastically is a bold move. It might pay off; it might also be disaster.<p>My personal preference is to agree with apg; the developer preview was less than stellar, but my expectations weren't terribly high. I don't really like the paradigm shift Microsoft is trying to force across the Windows brand as it exists for a desktop OS, but it might be great for what it was designed for--tablets and phones.<p>It should be said that I also didn't care much for Unity even though I gave it an honest try for about two-three weeks. There were some things that it did well--and were equally quite handy--and there were others that felt too jarring and awkward. Metro feels somewhat similar in that regard. However, I'll reserve my full judgement until we're closer to a more finalized product so we can see what Microsoft's vision ultimately boils down to; thusfar, I'm not terribly impressed, but I admit they're making a decent effort. I do look forward to seeing the finished product even if I absolutely hate it. :)",1328561143

""Free"" is a word that lights-up irrational neurons in our brains, like ""all you can eat."" It almost doesn't matter the cost.<p>That said, I can prove to you right now that this scheme will not work: On the music-side of the media world, I subscribe to Rdio. It's $10 per month for all-I-can-eat music. I listen to it via my computer, via my home stereo using Sonos (I can play up to three different songs simultaneously via Rdio using Sonos -- more than I'll ever need). And, I can download the songs to my iPhone and listen to them offline.<p>Yet, even with Rdio and the many compatible competitors (Rhapsody, Spotify, etc.), people still download music illegally ""for free.""  For $10 per month, I can have millions of songs available on-demand for instant playback or I can spend my time downloading songs, installing them in iTunes, syncing with my mobile device, etc. Why would anyone choose the ""free"" option? Personally, I don't know, but they do.<p>One difference... In the world of Rdio, songs are not free of DRM, but no one should care -- I certainly don't even though I was one of the people celebrating the move of music from DRMed to non-DRMed -- because six million or more songs are instantly available anywhere I might want to listen to them without any hassles. If I can get at the songs anywhere, at any time, from any device, without hassle, why do I care about DRM?",1328560833

I logged on to Netflix, saw that DVDs were the only available format, and closed the tab. Next I went to Amazon. I searched, and saw that that the complete box set of DVDs was priced at roughly $115. It was also available for streaming, so I was in business. Wait a moment. The price for ""buying"" access to the digital version was comparable to that of the DVDs (~$96 for all five seasons streamed, vs. ~$115 for the DVDs). That seems expensive for something that may not work in five years, but I decided to be a good citizen and pay to watch the first episode. As a bonus, I wouldn't have to sit through FBI warnings, unskippable previews, or a DVD menu. After paying $2, I looked for a way to download the episode to my (Mac) computer so that I could watch it without intermittent buffering delays. My connection is slow sometimes, and I can delay gratification to wait for a whole episode to download. Small problem. There is no download link. I suspect that this is because the episode could not be properly restricted with DRM. Sigh. Frustrated, I decided to risk buffer issues, and started playing the episode. No problems for five minutes, then <i>wham</i>, the video player crashed the Flash browser plugin. That's ok, I can copy the URI, restart the browser, and get back to watching. After hitting play a second time, <i>wham</i> it crashed again. Oh well, maybe Amazon does not test for Chrome. Let's try from Safari. Same problem. At this point I have paid $2, but cannot watch the episode I ""purchased."" What option do I have left? A torrent file for the series would be a few clicks away, and almost guaranteed to play on my computer--without buffering, DRM, browser plugins, FBI warnings, DVD menus, or unskippable previews. Why am I paying again?<p>In the end, Amazon apologized for the technical problem and kindly refunded my $2. As a consumer, I am willing to pay for something that works and is as convenient as pirated content. The industry isn't listening.<p>Will consumers really hazard pirate websites, when they can pay a fair price to download a DRM-free file from a fast server? Some may, but many more will pay.<p>The message from studios has to be about trust. ""We trust you as consumers. You can download DRM-free content from us at fair prices. You can trust that there won't be porno sidebar ads or phishing links. You can trust that we will have the fastest servers, offer the best quality content, and the most intuitive interface. We won't get in your way.""<p>Part of the problem of piracy is due to the release schedules of hollywood content. Perhaps movies should be released concurrently in theaters and online. Why download a recent movie when it is available online, legally? Many people will still visit theaters for the experience, and due to the short-term availability. Those who watch at home will pay if the prices are fair.<p>Edit: I now realize that the particular content I was looking for is available via iTunes, for the same price per episode as Amazon. I don't associate iTunes with video. Not sure why that is, but perhaps it is because of the lesser inventory.",1328560235

I know its popular for people to throw up their hands and give up and claim that index funds are the way to go.  I also know that many people who have done so, would prefer to think that they are doing the smart thing, and so they claim that this is the smart thing, despite the fact that it is really easy for anyone who thinks about it for a few minutes to beat those returns.  Take an index- say the Dow Jones[1].  The companies in the index don't change very often at all.  It would be very easy to buy a few shares of each company and simply hold them.  You have the commission fees in the first year, but with discount brokers, that's pretty small, and then there would be no more fees.  Meanwhile the people who gave up and just handed their money over to be ""managed"" in an index mutual fund are paying %1-%2 a year in fees.   Spending an hour making a spreadsheet and you can keep your replica of the Dow Jones balanced by adjusting where you put new money in.<p>Why pay %2 of your investment, every year, to managers for something that would take you an hour to do once?<p>Over 10 years that's %20 of your investment, not even counting the effects of compounding.<p>Over 40 years that's %80 of your investment, not counting the effects of compounding which will be much more significant.<p>[1] IF you don't have the funds to buy the whole index, you can buy just the heaviest weighted ones.  Further, when companies do leave or get added to the index, you can trade this when its announced, rather than have to wait like the index fund does, which means you get a better return because the index has to buy them after they've appreciated due to being announced as being added to the index.",1328560027

It is perfectly valid to say that the bare DOM functions are TEN times faster than jQuery at this particular task. But even the ""slow"" jQuery case runs more than <i>16,000</i> times in a second on Chrome. That ain't slow; you are unlikely to be injecting more than a dozen or so boxes a second so this isn't going to be your bottleneck.<p>These kind of benchmarks don't represent reality when you scale to an app where the inability to inject more than 16,000 boxes into a page per second might even conceivably be a bottleneck. It would be much more common, for example, to be building HTML templates via Mustache and injecting them all at once. Show me the comparison of doing that whole thing with DOM functions. :)<p>It is always better to start with some real code that is not performing well and find its bottlenecks. With that in mind I agree that using .live() with complex selectors or high-frequency events like mousemove is bad design. Preventing that sort of <i>unknowing</i> abuse is exactly why we deprecated .live() in 1.7. But I disagree with the generality that ""jQuery is slow"" simply because it doesn't compare well on some isolated jsperf tests, or because it provides powerful abstractions that can be abused.",1328559560

They are essentially trying to deploy a terrestrial network by defining it as an extension of a fairly minimal satellite network.<p>All of that is just regulatory issues though.  What really matters is interference; I don't (and the FCC doesn't seem to) care if a transmission comes from the ground or a satellite, so long as it doesn't mess with anybody else's services.<p>The two points of view are:<p>1) LightSquared is operating within their spectrum requirements, so while there are GPS receivers that will go haywire when they deploy, those GPS receivers are faulty (as they don't properly deal with neighboring transmissions on frequencies outside their band).<p>2) GPS should be granted a special exception to the rules about accepting interference as GPS is very important and the GPS signals are very weak, so therefore a receiver with little filtering on the front end is far superior to one more tolerant of high power signals on neighboring frequencies.<p>Both arguments have their merit, so it should be interesting to see how things play out.

For people who simply need a mobile device for recreational use, a tablet is vastly superior, with its extended battery life and ease and comfort of operation. For those who only need to have a workstation at a single fixed location, a desktop is the superior option, as the large screen, full-size keyboard and mouse are positioned in an optimal ergonomic manner, with the screen at eye level, keyboard and mouse at proper height and distance, etc., allowing for extended usage without repetitive stress injury.

The impression I get is that there is little technical evidence that using their spectrum will infringe upon and overpower the neighboring GPS and other signals.  LTE has VERY tight technical specifications, just to get valid data through, as the throughput is so high, and is unlikely to be a noisy signal out of band, enough so to cause interference with it's neighbors.  If you'll notice, the linked article carries very little (or none) technical detail, it almost sounds like some fear mongering politician wrote it.  This ain't the 1940's here people, we aren't just sending random analog radio waves out using oscillators with a 10% tolerance ratio. The spec is tight, the technology is bleeding edge, and modern receivers (of GPS and the like) have pretty good front end filters, out of band noise shouldn't be a huge problem for them.",1328558647

It's for everyone else that thinks the computer is a magic box.<p>For us, it gives us a story about someone who is trying to learn how to program and about programming culture. I think the author did a pretty good job of taking a month and exploring both the nuts an bolts of programming and the people behind it. Sure, she still couldn't do much at the end of the month, but at least she understood the process to some degree.<p>The sub-plot about _why is an interesting one. For those of us around during that time, it brings back memories of those frantic days. For the outside world, it is just an interesting story. The naming of _why at the end wasn't really necessary, but it didn't feel too out of place either. It's been long enough that it was conceivable that he may want to have some comment. She may have gone further than I would have to get a message to him, but she didn't cross the line. And it was clear from the article that he has a sufficient barrier around him to protect him from the public.<p>You're taking the throw-away line about showing up at his house too seriously. She's a journalist... that's what they do - try to get the story. Happily she decided that she didn't need to resort to that to finish the story. I think the line was just added to give a sense of just how deeply he had disappeared.<p>In our community, we respect _why's wishes and leave him alone. It isn't polite to discuss his private identity. But to the rest of the world, this just isn't a big deal. And I hardly think that he will now be bombarded by publicity.

They then could have put out feelers to find it's users / content a new home...

I code in little pieces (usually functions), which ""talk"" back to me immediately even before they are finished.<p>* REPL is getting really good => Clojure, Scala, Ruby, Groovy, etc.. REPLs save lots of time and prevents mistakes: where a 5 minutes REPLay session reveals a nice and polished approach a lot quicker than a ""let's try this / now rerun the test"" formula.<p>* Domain knowledge and ""'ve done this exact thing before"" greatly impact amount of testing needed => e.g. deeper domain knowledge allows for [better] tests, while no domain knowledge requires lots of prototyping (even if you think it is the ""real thing"" at first, it is not, it's a prototype), and would greatly suffer from a large number of tests, as most of the time will be spent rewriting test instead of learning the domain.<p>In the end, the rule of thumb I always use is ""do whatever makes sense"".

Sections 2-6 deal with how to elect congressman and the ""floor rules"" basically. Section 7 is how a bill becomes a law.<p>Section 8 specifically lists the powers reserved to Congress. Neither the Executive branch nor the Supreme Court is given this treatment. (Side note: patents are specifically listed here: ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;"")<p>Section 9 deals with a few other things such as immigration, ex post facto laws, taxes and spending money. Section 10 is rules on what states can't do.<p>Furthermore, Amendment 10 reads:<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.<p>The government does have power to step out of this specific list, due to the ""necessary and proper"" clause, but in general this used to be considered a clause where the government can do whatever is ""necessary and proper"" to exercise their duty to govern within their enumerated powers. This is spelled out by Justice Marshall in McCulloch vs. Maryland: ""If the end be legitimate, and within the scope of the Constitution, all the means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may constitutionally be employed to carry it into effect.""<p>However, later on in his opinion he also states: ""This Government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers. The principle that it can exercise only the powers granted to it would seem too apparent to have required to be enforced by all those arguments which its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people, found it necessary to urge; that principle is now universally admitted. But the question respecting the extent of the powers actually granted is perpetually arising, and will probably continue to arise so long as our system shall exist.""<p>This has always been a tricky question. There is a limit on Congress' power. While it is not limited simply to those listed in the Constitution, everybody that I know thinks Congress has overstepped their boundaries countless times.<p>The trouble is that we the people are no longer invested in our government and don't properly hold them to account. We elect people who benefit <i>me</i> the most, as opposed to the <i>country</i>. This is normal, but when you couple that with a court system that is overloaded and an executive branch that is, frankly, out of control and insanely drunk with power, bad government happens.",1331819289

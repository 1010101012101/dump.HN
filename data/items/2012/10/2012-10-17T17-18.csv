4665686,comment,4665188,4665578,5,0,rayiner,,,"There will be no patent reform as long as the tiny niche of web software people claim that everyone who doesn't oppose the existing system is in favor of ""IP maximalism."" Patent reform is going to require web software people convincing the electrical engineers why software patents have a very different effect in their space than say the patents on OFDM, and they're not going to do it by being arrogant and dismissive.<p>The rest of the engineering community by and large doesn't understand what software folks are ranting about. People don't accidentally infringe on the OFDM patent, people don't accidentally come up with the same chemical formula for a drug. To them, people who oppose patents are in the same bucket as Chinese companies who rip off American technology--they want to copy other peoples' work for profit.<p>This is not to say that patent reform in the area of software isn't beneficial or desirable. But the attitude that anybody who opposes it won't listen to reason dramatically overstates the universality of the arguments and the consensus around the position.",1350496744

Of course it's possible to use it for other stuff like pointing to a template (though I'll point out that it can be done faster and more obviously by replacing it with a single function call at the end of the method), but ""right tool for the job"" and all that.<p>There's a very widely understood premise in programming that comments are blocks of text in source code files intended only to be read by humans and have no effect on program execution.

God help you.<p>Also worth noting in your sample code is that many ORMs simply query the DB for the schema and cache that result, so you don't need either of those.

Unit tests will fail, and the software will not run. Someone checking in code that fails to such a degree deserves what's coming to them. That covers php -l. Var_dump and debug_backtrace are irrelevant to my use case, and I use proper breakpoints and watches anyway (phpstorm + zend debugger).

Yes it can hold a lot of data, but one common reason brought up from corporate IT guys about why they were looking into Git was that they were having some problems scaling Perforce.  From downtime to storage issues, cpu's overloading, etc.  The lag from a remote office was annoying, the read-only replication servers had some annoying bugs that forced some users to abandon it, etc.  On more than one occasion I have heard horror stories about the lag if you want to sync from 8:30-9:30 in the morning or are trying to sync/commit at 5pm in a large development office.  Various perforce commands are very expensive and they <i>all</i> run on the server side so the equivalent of git blame can really tax the server.  And if the server ever went down unlike Git you can't keep working.  All of the above means you need beefier and more expensive Perforce servers.  And don't forget about the licensing costs!<p>Sure Perforce is nice, but it is hardly perfect.

Please allow me to recommend to you and to other HN participants who surf by who are parents of children learning to read the best--bar none--approach to initial reading instruction in English for native speakers of English. It has worked for all four of my children, including the three who spent significant parts of their childhood in a mostly Chinese-speaking environment (reducing their exposure to English speech and English printed materials). The book Let's Read, a Linguistic Approach<p><a href=""http://wsupress.wayne.edu/slp/bloomfieldlr.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wsupress.wayne.edu/slp/bloomfieldlr.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Read-A-Linguistic-Approach/dp/0814334555"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Read-A-Linguistic-Approach/dp/081...</a><p>by Leonard Bloomfield (an eminent linguist and pioneer of new methods of teaching hard-to-learn languages) and Clarence L. Barnhart (a lexicographer) has now been revised by Cynthia A. Barnhart and Robert K. Barnhart (I presume they are the original co-author's children). I used the first edition, and can recommend it UNRESERVEDLY. The first edition appears to no longer be in print, and some Amazon reviewers say they prefer the first edition, but the second edition, currently available, surely is better than the great mass of school materials used for English reading instruction. How I used the book is to set a goal of somewhere between one lesson a day and six or seven pages a day, and then read each lesson out loud to my child, with my child then reading the lesson back to me, with adaptation earlier in the book to do the reading and reading back a sentence at a time, and near the end of the book for the child to read by himself or herself without me reading first. All my children are strong readers who love to read. You'll find that this book, under Bloomfield's pedagogical influence, makes good use of spaced repetition of the key sound-symbol correspondences in Engish. But this is reading connected text, rather than just looking at flash cards, and the stories are remarkably interesting for their carefully graded vocabulary.<p>More details if you like. My main online involvement in the early 1990s was discussion of optimal reading instruction approaches for United States schools, but now I've discovered that mathematics education needs at least as much help, and have shifted focus to that. But I could provide (old) links to rationale for this approach if you like, and anyway an ounce of inexpensive prevention is worth a pound of expensive cure when helping a child's initial reading instruction prevents future reading and spelling difficulties. And kudos to you for continuing to read aloud to your child as he learns to read. Not reading to children beyond school age is one of the big missed opportunities in many middle-class families.<p>Aside to other participants: I'm wondering how many people who have used flash cards for foreign language learning have put their languages to the test in a country where those languages are spoken. I have studied many languages (I think there is a partial list in my user profile), and what I have observed over and over is how each language maps reality in a different way, so that ones rarely correspond one-to-one in the manner expected by flashcards. I much preferred learning to read Chinese, for example, by using the excellent Chinese Reader series by John DeFrancis<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Chinese-Reader-Part/dp/0300020600/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Chinese-Reader-Part/dp/03000...</a><p>through which I first learned about Bloomfield's approach to foreign language teaching. (DeFrancis was a student of Bloomfield's.)",1350494203

Not because of particularities in the implementation (eg. speed), but because it gives you an easier time working with it; there's no mismatch.<p>I'd say that if you are working with diverse documents with a few or no relationships, a document oriented database is necessarily a better fit to the task at hand than a relational one.

Creativity was encouraged and normally rewarded in this class (I liked the teacher a lot, actually, and was irked also because it was out of character for her to forbid thinking outside the box).<p>2. It wasn't during a unit on aerodynamics, and in any case, ""the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a moving object"" is quite relevant to wads of paper, meteorites, missiles, arrows, helicopters, and various other objects that are not airplanes.  It might have been a good opportunity to explore why something like my wad of paper would go farther than most planes, as well as the relative real world advantages of different things.",1231231547

The General Theory is a difficult and dense book and Krugman offers a decent summary of Keynes' paradox of thrift.<p>If you are interested in economics, the problem with your suggestion is that  by the time he gets around to discussing the paradox of thrift, Keynes has already broken claims that Say's Law forces supply and demand into equilibrium through changes to the wage level. If I remember correctly, he did this with the empirical observation that while additional wages may induce labor to enter the workforce, declines in real wages don't generally cause a decline in demand for employment.",1231229692

And click again to capitalize, and repeat this process for each new letter. Couldn't be simpler.""</i><p>By my count, that is 5 steps. On a keyboard, assuming a touch typist, the step count is reduced to 1: push a button. I say that a keyboard is much simpler.<p>To me, touch typing on a keyboard is much more natural than the hunt-and-peck (sorry, scroll-and-click) method of text entry that the MacBook Wheel uses. I am more productive touch-typing.<p>However, I can see the benefits of this on-screen keyboard display. Hunt-and-peck typists don't have to constantly shift their attention from the keyboard to the screen and back constantly. However, for touch typists, I can't see any immediate benefits.<p><i>""It remains to be seen that the wheel will catch on in the business world where people use computers for actual work and not just dicking around.""</i><p>So wait... we aren't supposed to be doing work on these? Is this supposed to be only a toy?<p><i>""With a price tag of just under $26,000 for the lowest-end MacBook Wheel...""</i><p>That is one pricey toy!<p>The new MacBook was designed with simplicity in mind. There must be a point where design becomes too simple. It must have been designed for a <i>very</i> specific subset of users.",1231229079

But I was frustrated because most design decisions require some indepedence and instinct, and it&#x27;s difficult to argue with marketing-focused people who solely rely on figures, charts and basic strategies.

Marketing needs to sell, developers need to make it work, designers to make it beautiful and usable. When 2 of these goals are assigned to the same team, there is a purpose conflict.

If so, it&#x27;s getting twice the work done and using twice the power (ignoring cache misses and the like for the moment). If it&#x27;s clocked the same as A, it&#x27;s performance and power usage will be almost the same as A.<p>Roughly speaking, power used = transistors switching per unit time. Performance should also follow that pretty closely, depending on the efficiency of the design. At some level, you should be able to look at any instruction and find a corresponding number of transistors that need to switch for it to execute.<p>Deep pipelining keeps more silicon active at any given time, increasing both performance and power consumption. Because of cache misses and the like, efficiency will drop somewhat. Double the stages also doesn&#x27;t quite equal double the switches per time, for various reasons. Therefore, deeper pipelines = worse performance per watt but better performance per dollar (not sure how well that&#x27;ll hold in ridiculous cases like Prescott).<p>From what I heard, Bulldozer only has one more stage than Haswell (15 vs. 14, don&#x27;t quote me on that) - not nearly enough to account for the differences we see between them.<p>What I&#x27;m noting is that there are many, many more factors at play than just pipelining. In the case of Bulldozer, I&#x27;ve been hearing quite a bit about minor parts that they found needed more work, most notably branch prediction. It sounds like they&#x27;ve got lots of things that will improve performance with no power or die size downsides. The number I saw bandied about for Steamroller was a 30% performance increase. I have some trouble believing it&#x27;s quite that big, but if they pull it off, that will be an amazing chip for being 32nm.

This model also has the benefit of returning related content (other files in the same directory), as opposed to alternate results.

Any behavior that doesn&#x27;t cause harm to another human being (which can ethically be argued to include oneself or not, but the former makes things much more complicated) should not be illegal. Behaviors proven to cause harm to other human beings (like the drunk driving you suggest), even if unintentional, have the effect of high likelihood of harm to others, and are also valid. Criminalize and legislate away things that harm others. And you need the ability to <i>scientifically</i> verify direct harm or exceedingly high correlations between behavior and harm to outlaw or regulate some behavior.<p>That means public nudity is legal, nothing about same sex should exist, you can smoke whatever you want (unless it kills you, or permanently maims you, which is why I think self-harm being legal is acceptable, and you should only criminalize the acts of harming <i>others</i>) but not be mentally compromised in public, you can grow whatever you want, you can bear firearms but not take them in public (unless unloaded), you would set speed limits to the first standard deviation of the average speed of a road (ie, the bounds of safety) rather than some arbitrary unrealistic number that causes everyone to speed, etc.<p>I mean, hell, you could make this very simple in what is criminal:<p>* Do not directly endanger others excessively through reckless behavior or use of dangerous tools.<p>* Do not actively hurt another through physical or excessive emotional violence (the latter would have to be extended mental trauma, not just calling someone a name).<p>And there you go. The first needs a jury to decide if it is a true endangerment in certain conduct, the latter is pretty straightforward, and it only gets murky if you consider ones ability to self-harm being outlawed, which makes a lot of behavior illegal.<p>Trying to extend them to animals gets complicated, but I figure the distinction is the act of causing pain and suffering vs killing for function. IE, don&#x27;t endanger or harm other animals unless for the purposes of harvesting resources from them, and only do so causing as little suffering as possible, and that you can&#x27;t &quot;harvest&quot; an animal owned by someone else (ie, don&#x27;t murder your neighbors dog saying you wanted to eat dog steaks).",1371079753

There's coursework and homework and studying and some extracurricular activities, and once you're done with all that I suppose you can ""think and create"", but nowhere and nohow is that the goal or reality of college, except <i>maybe</i> a visual arts college.<p>If your college left you with nothing but ""time to think and create"", dropping out was absolutely the right choice! The entire point (until PhD studies) is that you should be learning and doing things according to some curriculum; if you're not there for the curriculum, what are you doing there at all?",1307138394

2618144,comment,2617792,2617948,14,0,nirvdrum,,,"I hope you realize that by titling your first piece on the matter ""RubyGems: Nerd rage is optional (and discouraged)"" and then following up with ""RubyGems drama"" that you were never really mediating.  Maybe you brought people together over Skype and got some discussions going.  Maybe you were just trying to be sensational.  But I immediately discounted everything said from that point forward, as did many others I know, for the simple reason that you continued with the same attitude that we were all tired of.  You were perpetuating the very thing we wanted to see changed.<p>The RubyGems matter isn't a technical one; SlimGems effectively dispelled that notion.  It's a personnel matter.  It's a cultural matter.  The only way I'm ever going to have faith in that project again is when the guys running it value running, working software over theoretical, idealistic improvements.  And I simply don't believe that will be the case until Eric & Ryan leave or are otherwise removed.<p>The sad part is RubyGems is so critical to the ecosystem that it really started making me question the value in using or relying on Ruby at all.  The egos didn't help either.  I can take a certain amount of crap if the system works and I can put up with broken software from nice, responsive people.  I can't deal with both failings.  In that regard, SlimGems has done more to restore my confidence in the Ruby ecosystem than anything else.",1307138389

It's necessary for people to receive feedback, and to communicate with one another using the comment section. What if instead of comments though, there was some other way to leave feedback? Maybe a rating system in place of comments.<p>I want to see if comments are truly necessary- oftentimes I feel that comments are critical but way too bulky. I'm trying to cut out all the things that just aren't needed in order to launch.<p>*Edit:  I'll clarify the question a little. I understand comments depends on what kind of site it is. Let's take a photo sharing site for example. I read recently somewhere that a company made a phone app that could let you wink, smiley face, or unhappy face at a photo instead of the generic comments you see.<p>I'm asking whether or not you could see alternatives to comments becoming a success by changing the commenting model as a whole. It's not about my site in particular, it's about comments itself. Do you see yourself satisfied with not being able to leave actual text as comments but instead having to wink, leave a smiley face, rate the photo?",1307138369

First and foremost I will not yield on Andi's ""point"" about cost to future generations.
Second, you brought up nuclear waste disposal in oil wells as a hand waving suggestion. I had no intention of changing the subject. I should not have responded to this disposal comment. There is quite a concerted effort to stop the countries you mentioned achieving nuclear arms, and it may stop them, so it's not irrelevant to the oil well point. It should not be made easier for people to develop nuclear weapons grade plutonium. This whole oil well thread of conversation is irrelevant however, in my opinion. I suggest we drop this element of the conversation, because it will not lead anywhere fruitful, I believe.<p>To bring some focus to this discussion: you have said that I have made two separate claims. I made one single claim. The claim I continue to make is that: Andi said that ignoring the cost for future generations was the issue. He wasn't arguing against all technical progress. 
The second time I mentioned this, was as clarification to the claim.<p>Here is what he wrote:<p>>>You are stuck in a view that energy needs to be cheap and that energy must be available despite the costs of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations. This is the classical view of people who see technical progress as a kind of god given fact or as the natural direction humanity must take.<p>This does not argue against all technical progress, it argues against ignoring the cost to future generations. As I see it, that is the claim I am making, and that quote is the evidence to back up my claim. This is not a second or third claim, this is the claim I have been making all along.<p>If you could please, tell me what separate claims you think I am making.<p>I don't think you can make a rule out of the claim that western societies' pollution has decreased over the last 50-60 years. You've given an example, I've given counter examples, i.e. it is not a rule. We can get into an example war, where I can give more and more examples of pollution increase, and you can give more and more examples of pollution decrease, and there's no point in it. There is no rule that states pollution and energy usage reduce with better economies and technology.<p>Just because China has started to invest in clean technology (clean in some circumstances means nuclear, I assume you don't mean that), doesn't mean it's going to use it, and it doesn't mean it's pollution and energy usage will reduce. I've invested in pink socks, am I going to wear them?<p>I will read Andi's other comments now for better or worse. To reiterate: there is no forced binary choice to be made between living as luddites, and ignoring the cost of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations. Is that clear?",1307136847

It implies that the command (ls -l) is read by the terminal emulator, which gives it to bash, which gives it to the kernel.</i><p>It's accurate, the author just left off where the command is coming from (implying it's the user sitting at a keyboard).  You type into the terminal-emulator, which passes that input to the program it's running, the shell, which figures out what it means.<p>A terminal (or something emulating a terminal) is always between the keyboard and the input of the program running.  Even when you login on the console, the terminal driver is accepting your input, transforming it in some fashion, and giving it to the nxt level.<p>A terminal doesn't exist between this echo command and the sh program:<p><pre><code>   echo ls -l | sh
</code></pre>
And is, in fact, why things like expect(1) exist and that ssh can be configured to allocate a pseudo-terminal or not depending on how you want/need to interact with the remote command.<p>Incidentally, there seems to be a bug in yum whereby it detects if its output is a terminal or not tries to format it, but it gets the check reversed and pretty-print word-wraps output that goes to a non-terminal.  Which is why<p><pre><code>   yum search something
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>   yum search something | sort
</code></pre>
produce different output and the latter has blank lines scattered throughout.  (yum 3.2.28 on Fedora 14).<p><i>And of course, the kernel is not really of importance here. The selected command does whatever it does, which might not even access the kernel (""Hello, world"").</i><p>Every <i>Hello, World</i> program I've seen displays text to the user (or sends it somewhere), which means a system call, which is calling ""kernel functions"".  The kernel is the mediator between programs/processes, there are very few cases where it isn't directly involved.<p><i>And bash can and sometimes does directly call kernel functions without an intermediate binary (e.g., unlink(2) to overwrite a file for output redirection).</i><p>Not really a good example, but the idea is sound.  Bash has builtin functionality that emulate the functionality of system calls or other binaries.  For this case, bash opens files for redirection when it's going to overwrite with the O_TRUNC flag set.  This can be changed with various shell options (clobber) to have it not implicitly overwrite.  You can see this with strace.<p>And technically, ""overwriting"" a file means truncation or seek-and-write, not unlink and recreate.  The difference has implications for hardlinked files.",1307135421

You have to work rather hard to get that, by wrapping things up in little holders which are captured by value, but don't do a deep copy when they themselves are copied. It reminds me a little of how arrays are sometimes used to capture final variables in a mutable way in Java anonymous inner classes.<p>What this means is that whenever you pass off a lambda to a function, and that lambda captures a variable, you need to be aware of whether or not the function keeps a reference to the lambda someplace, so that you'll know if it's safe to capture by reference or not. If you capture by reference but the function keeps a reference to the lambda, and it gets called after the captured variable has gone out of scope, you'll get into some nasty trouble.<p>And this is why I don't like the C++ spec as it stands. It requires a kind of global knowledge to work with correctly in local contexts, in such a way that the compiler can't really help you either (it may have been possible to annotate types to indicate closure lifetime, but it would be painful without more powerful type inference than C++ has).",1307135267

So, if you think of links as ""votes"" as the core-data for Google's PageRank.. Than at PostRank we're extending that graph with dozens of other gestures: bookmarks, likes, comments, etc, and building our ranking on top of that! I'm sure you can imagine the myriad of ways of how that data can be applied in different contexts.<p>Super excited to join Google and take it to the next level!",1307134957

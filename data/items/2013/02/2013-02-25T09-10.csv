5278112,comment,5277916,5277948,5,0,epidemian,,,"Hey Jeremy, congratulations for the 1.5 release; really awesome stuff there! I'm especially liking the new REPL =D<p>About Literate CoffeeScript, i wonder if it'd play nice with moderately complex pieces of code, which, in general, tends to be quite nested/indented. The example on the CoffeeScript compiler, scope.litcoffee[1], looks quite nice, but at the same time it's a fairly simple class; it doesn't need intra-method comments for example.<p>For more complex pieces of code[2], that make use of comments in fairly indented sections to explain what's going on, do you think the literate style would work too? Or would then make more sense to mix both worlds and use hash-style (#) comments for the more nested bits and literate-style ""comments"" for describing the more top-level things?<p>For reading code, i personally really really like the two-column Docco style[3]; the way the comments don't interrupt the code but are there on a side instead. The challenge would be how to see the source code in that nice two-column style while editing :D<p>Edit: well, phpnode asked basically the same thing regarding indentation (should use F5 more often).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/scope.litcoffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/s...</a><p>[2]: like nodes.coffee: <a href=""https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/nodes.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/n...</a><p>[3]: nodes.coffee post Docco: <a href=""http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/nodes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/nodes.html</a>",1361786113

The idea is robust and noble, but the execution is beyond horrible - to the point that it ISN'T clearly better than the alternatives.

Tonsils are an ""early warning"" outpost of the immune system - they sample pathogens while still in the throat, to give a ""heads up"" to the immune system in the gut. Removal of tonsils is associated with higher all cause mortality (especially heart attacks). The appendix is a curated cache of the good bacteria that the body needs in the gut (and possibly in other places), and there are circumstances in which the body will release another dose of good bacteria (though those are not well characterized yet, to the best of my knowledge).<p>> yet currently practicing physicians just choose to assume that we shouldn't remove stuff without a very grave reason.<p>I don't think that's really true. For one, most physicians in the US are still antibiotics-trigger happy (for whatever reason, even though most of them surely know it's harmful). That removes symbiotic organisms much more efficiently than it does harmful organisms, causing such things as yeast infections, the low B12 epidemic, and more.<p>They are more careful now with surgically removing stuff, true, but only recently, and only just.",1361785274

So while I agree that you can do most of what you want with a more simplified approach, I don't think that Knuth's approach was just there to escape from Pascal's declaration syntax.<p>Out-of-order code can be quite useful if the literate document is the <i>narrative</i> of the code, how you derive your algorithms and create your functions. The final untangled code is devoid of this, and presents a more conventional structure. One example would be some global variables (or configuration hash, if that statement made you faint a bit). In the end, you probably would want at least one view of the code where this is collected in one spot, even if the programming language would theoretically allow you to declare it bit by bit all over the place.<p>On the other hand, this style doesn't lend itself that well to a constantly revised code base, as that would mean reading a narrative all over again.",1361785186

Assuming they can actually design an ATM quality/secure machine, who pays for it?  Assuming the retailer pays for it, what sort of return could a retailer expect for having the device?  TCO - How long will it take to pay off the investment.<p>Then on top of that you need to offer a service whereby people are emptying the machines regularly.  And since the people emptying these machines would be putting their lives in danger handling money all of the time out in public, you'd need to hire a professional firm like Brinks, or absorb the large costs of trying to do this yourself.<p>Then assuming these guys want to get paid themselves, there will be administrative costs as well.<p>How much does a bitcoin end up costing with all of the extra fees at the end of the day?  Is it worth it?  Does a system where you have to walk/drive to a location with cash in hand to purchase bitcoins, and pay a significantly larger amount of money for them offer value?<p>I can see this idea appealing to the anonymous aspect of the currency, but since any location these are placed in would have to be under constant video surveillance, that makes it a little more tricky.<p>In the end, since there already exists the ability to get bitcoins with cash at WalMart and CVS via bitinstant, I don't think this idea will go much farther than the hobbyboards and display they've tucked into a box and connected to the internet.",1361785001

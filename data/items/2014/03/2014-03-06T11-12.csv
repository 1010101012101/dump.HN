Such electric fields, which range in size up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.&quot;<p>Do you know if these phenomena are connected?",1394106914

I&#x27;ve certainly decided not to deal with a company again because right after the initial transaction I&#x27;ve gotten hit with a flood of this spam.  I suspect there&#x27;s one of the standard measurement issues where companies find it easier to quantify customers who&#x27;ve apparently come back due to this kind of marketing than to measure customers who&#x27;ve gotten sick of it and reduced or ceased their business with the company.  It&#x27;s possible to do a better job, but these companies never seem to and it might be that there&#x27;s a perverse incentive for the marketers to mismeasure.<p>Having worked directly under the SVP of Business Intelligence & Analytics at one of the larger US-based social networks I can say from experience that it&#x27;s really, really hard to get people to consider the things that are hard to measure or hard to interpret.  Even in a company that&#x27;s heavily analytics-driven there&#x27;s a lot of magical thinking, a lot of anecdata, and a strong bias towards short term effects.  Think of it as the marketing equivalent of laying off 20% of your workforce, telling everyone else to work 25% harder, and convincing Wall Street this means profits will go up and stay up.<p>It&#x27;s easy to spot the bump in your balance sheet from lower costs and it&#x27;s hard to quantify the long term costs of decreased morale, lower total productivity, most likely lower <i>individual</i> productivity, attrition, and inability to take advantage of opportunities.",1394106720

Ease of maintenance is the goal.  Basically RPC is bad because it is an extreme tight coupling between client and server.  Change one single parameter in one single SOAP method?  Get ready for every single client to have to recompile.  Even the ones that never used that particular method (there are techniques to minimize this, but with REST you don&#x27;t have to think about this problem).<p>REST is about loose coupling.  If you follow HATEOAS properly the clients won&#x27;t even need to recompile if you do a massive refactoring of where your resources are.  So long as you&#x27;re not doing direct serialization of the XML resources, you also won&#x27;t have to recompile for every tiny schema tweak.  If a field you <i>use</i> changes, obviously you have to change the client.  If a field you <i>don&#x27;t</i> use changes you probably don&#x27;t even need to restart your client.<p>This is what it buys you.  If you don&#x27;t get any benefit from the loose coupling then you don&#x27;t need REST.  But if that&#x27;s the case then I wonder if you need a three tiered system at all.",1394104766

You can still get about one third of the book from TypeSafe&#x27;s website, which is enough to get the ball rolling. It&#x27;s written for Scala 2.9 so it doesn&#x27;t have Futures in it, plus you should ignore the stuff about actors in later chapters (actors from the standard library are deprecated, Akka actors have been the norm for some time - and at first you should ignore actors completely, since that&#x27;s a big topic). But that&#x27;s OK. In case you&#x27;d prefer another book, make sure to not read anything published before 2010 as (IMHO) everything published before 2010 is awful.<p>Since I wrote that article a couple of newer books happened, that I haven&#x27;t read, like &quot;Scala in Action&quot; or &quot;Atomic Scala&quot; and thus cannot recommend, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about, so ask others or read reviews, etc...<p>There&#x27;s also an advanced book called &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot;, by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason, I&#x27;ve read about 8 chapters from it and it&#x27;s a really, really good book on FP design & concepts. However it&#x27;s a hard read, because while the language is approachable and doesn&#x27;t assume much Scala knowledge, it&#x27;s the kind of book that&#x27;s designed around mind-bending (SICP-style) exercises - it takes me about 1 week to get through a chapter and right now I don&#x27;t have time for the rest, but with each chapter my knowledge expands :-)<p>If you like an IDE, IntelliJ IDEA 13 for Scala is everything you&#x27;d expect out of an IDE, but as I&#x27;ve said in my blog post, when I&#x27;m learning a new language I don&#x27;t want to bother with learning a new toolset too, so I start with a comfortable plain-text editor and work from there.<p>When you get stuck, I must emphasize on nr.2 - ask questions on scala-user - beginners are always welcome.",1394104418

Meganduma,0,1,0.0,0,2,"I founded www.YouTours.com after a trip to Southeast Asia in late 2010.  YouTours.com is a platform for sharing self-guided tours.  The Mission?  To make sure no good story goes untold.<p>Prior to that, I was a trial lawyer who loved to blog about wine (www.WineForBlondes.com), travel, and learn anything I could about the human experience.  In November, 2010, while traveling through Cambodia, I met a 45-year-old tour guide named Than who would change the course of my life's work.<p>Than had survived the brutal regime of the Khmer Rouge, a communist group which occupied Cambodia in the 1970's. His story was the most remarkable and heroic thing I'd heard in my life.  It was the best tour I had ever been on.<p>A day later, we traveled to Angkor Wat to check out the majestic temples, one of the eight wonders of the world. We hired a tour guide with high hopes that Angkor would reveal more amazing and touching stories.  Due to the lame tour guide, it did not.  Day wasted.  When we got back to our hotel, I googled, ""Audio Tours"" looking for self-guided tours of Angkor.  I couldn't find one site that worked, but rather a hodge-podge of sites with no common marketplace.  That was the birth of YouTours.<p>I wanted guides like Than to be able to share their stories, earn money, and make travel more enriching for everyone.  So, I raised a very small amount of seed funding, and www.YouTours.com was born.  The site has not been launched, but is in the last phases of development for its first launch.<p>I know this site has global reach and amazing potential to help both guides and travelers.  And I'd like to launch it big, loud, and far.",1317083832,

medicek,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Executive Summary<p>Overview of Project and Idea<p>This Internet and software project is the development of a practical and pragmatic synergistic paradigm-shift to the way people currently use the technology available to them. This is the introduction of a business concept developed by Derek Lowe, Proprietorship called IQ Mind Map. The venture team has developed a learning / educational Internet product that will serve the needs of its users through enriching their lives and relationships through technology when using this easy to use interactive E Learning program. The IQ Mind Map project can be seen as a facilitator to the future of the worldwide intelligent network and will usher in a deeper understanding and interaction with the meaningful world.<p>The Internet-related concept and application provides people with a single information management and processing system of their own to operate, for their personal growth and intellect. The developed product will be used to map the users lives - through photos, videos, information updates, comments, and specific content - cataloging it all, literally from the beginning. Every users timeline can travel back to an entry for their birth.<p>Herein lies the synergistic paradigm shift that IQ Mind Map represents. The concept will revolutionize how people empower themselves with the Internet. No longer will people have to fight the trends of commercialism, rather they can design their own path of customized learning and information management. The product will be sold as a personal / private blog template and Internet application that is then customized to the users benefit. This interaction allows the user to learn, remember and enrich their intellect through the power of the Internet. A virtual information road map, The IQ Mind Map will be the source for users to manage their life experiences satisfactorily; from basic day-to-day diary-based entries to manifested as a virtual road map of your life and intellectual growth.  The product is unique in the sense that it is continuously growing and evolving in tandem with the life of the user.<p>The concept puts the users life and intellectual growth as the focus.  Unlike the ubiquitous information gathering companies and social networking services, this project aims to define itself less as a social networking service or platform for short term benefit and more as an educational and innovative service that intends on being a software leader in personal learning and growth.<p>Product<p>Software entrepreneurs like to talk about the ""minimum viable product""; that is, the very minimum that you have to build for your product to be useful (since you can always add enhancements later with software). In very simple terms, the MVP for this product is building of something like a personal / private blog -- categorized (x-axis of the visualization), timestamped (time axis) posts with arbitrary content, plus some fancy visualization. Good news about that; the back end is very easy, interface notwithstanding. Most of the development will be a timeline view of the data. The idea teaches people to have smarter interactions with, summarize, and centralize the multitude of events across their lives. By utilizing a well defined educational program, this piece leverages all the content produced by a user and enhances its utility by linking data points to actual relevant articles. Using the navigation stick advances the graphic at a readable and controlled pace that feels like scrolling. The developed product will be used to map the users lives - through articles, photos, videos, information updates, comments, and specific content - cataloging it all, literally from the beginning. Importantly, mouseless accessibility is imbedded for mobile applications. Again, herein lies the synergistic paradigm shift that IQ Mind Map represents. The user commands the power of the Internet by E Managing information at powerful levels with a system that serves their needs: to learn, remember, and enrich their intellect. IQ Mind Map explores how to simultaneously show different slices through the dataset at any given time. At start up, the page loads with a nice introductory animation that gives a quick overview of the timeline of events and very clearly suggests functionality. Last to load are the navigational elements, suggesting how we should explore the timeline. The suggested dimensionality and well-defined symbols are visually striking and there are smart interaction design elements. The symbols and key are easy to follow and the relationship of the timeline content labels is obvious, especially when hovering over an event and maneuvering through layers of data. With ease the program also enhances access beyond flash and the mouse by listing out the articles and links for each topic timeline on user request.<p>This system is an Internet phenomenon not yet created by any other developer; the program can ultimately be used as a informative road trip every week or month to refresh the brain's memories. IQ Mind Map is not just the story of your life, it is a tool to make you more intelligent. Similar graphics have been shared across the web and praised for its striking visuals and extreme utility. By using the IQ Mind Map program users will finally have the ability to document and recall everything meaningful to them in one powerful program.<p>On the educational and learning side of the process the mobile device and desktop computer supply the brain with unprecedented opportunity to review what was once left to memory to sort out and jot down. Now people are able to use already available technology to elevate the organization and management levels of their lives.  A kind of virtual instructor programed to assist the user. In tandem with the users device the brains neurons and synaptic networks can be strengthened by continuously (over a life time) reviewing, sharing and editing previously forgotten thoughts and ideas. Ultimately making the user smarter, a wonderful bi-product of simple time management.<p>To give a contextual view of this proposal please visit the following interactive:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/68tu9vr  Contextually you will have to imagine that the bottom timeline is the life of a person from his/her first memory to present day. The ""Path or road will be the interactive timeline individuals will use to map their lives.

The investment will be invested in the steps to take the concept through the product development stage, then marketing and advertising, and sales of the IQ Mind Map program.  The team is also open to other creative partnership possibilities and approaches.<p>Background and Future of Internet<p>The Global Brain is a metaphor for the worldwide intelligent network formed by people together with the information and communication technologies that connect them into an ""organic"" whole. As the Internet becomes faster, more intelligent, more ubiquitous and more encompassing, it increasingly ties us together in a single information processing system, that functions like a ""brain"" for the planet Earth. The term was coined by Peter Russell in 1982 to describe how the Internet might be developed to achieve this.<p>Research and development shows the trends, and I just want to draw a little bit of a futuristic picture, which is the emergence of the global brain. Consisting of all the humans connected to each other and to the machines they interact with in a very unique and profound way. Creating an intelligence that does not belong to any single human being or computer, but really spread out living its own life and significantly defining the actions of each particular individual, in the not so distant future. One striking fact is that about 20 percent of the global energy 10 years from now will be dedicated solely to maintain this global intelligence, and this number is around 10 percent already today in developed countries. And that actually can comfortably compare to 20 percent of calories that our human brains consume daily to support our traditional intelligence.<p>A good comment that outlines the importance of developing this type of software....<p>The Global Brain already exists in nature  in that the infant brain is delivered out of the box, as it were, un-accessorized. Immediately after, however, (and perhaps even in the womb?) parents, care-givers, peers and a host of other actors begin the natural process of accessorizing the newborn with the provincial characteristics needed to maximize the potential for survival in its present environment: language, culture, beliefs, prejudices, and myriad other social and intellectual delineators and constrictors. Ironically these very accoutrement's, while ensuring inter-cultural harmony, have also been ultimately responsible for the most xenophobically-driven, egregious acts of horror and inhumanity ever recorded throughout history.<p>The Global Brain stands in stark contrast, accessorized to reason expansively vs. provincially. By nature it understands why others behave and believe as they do. Two and one-half millennia ago Aristotle coined the word ecumenism, referring to a world under one roof. Similarly, IQ Mind Map's ultimate vision reaches far, far beyond the disappointments of wealth and power. Those sad eyes betray an innate human longing: a humankind truly and ultimately ecumenical in nature.<p>1 Referenced from Wikipedia.com, Global Brain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain<p>--",1319333761,1452898376

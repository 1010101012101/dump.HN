7713723,comment,7712684,7712684,4,0,thechairman,,,"Took delivery of a Tesla yesterday, only a few weeks after getting a comparably priced Mercedes Benz for my wife.  I will just say that I think the Tesla money is well spent and the MB money is wasted on a company that makes a nice car but seems to be stuck 10+ years in the past on a lot of fronts.<p>The Tesla costs too much but it feels like the best way to support getting our planet off of petroleum which is the cause of so many problems.  So I don&#x27;t begrudge the price.<p>It&#x27;s damn fun to drive.  I won&#x27;t hold my breath for any of the incumbents to do a decent job of making an electric car - maybe Porsche.<p>The electronics alone make the MB look ancient.  The MB nav isn&#x27;t touch screen, uses a ludicrous scroll wheel and is almost useless.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve got an enormous touch screen with a pinch/zoom google maps system.  This part has nothing to do with being an electric car.<p>If they can come out with a more affordable suv or sedan I think they will change the world of cars and driving.  I&#x27;m thinking that all the rest of the car companies are basically hoping they die and they can go back to business as usual with the oil companies as best friends.",1399517923

Considering you need a well known and agreed peering agreement - BGP is not designed for use on end-points in any dynamic peering fashion.  It is an external &quot;routing&quot; protocol.  Hosts leverage &quot;routed&quot; protocols (e.g. IP).  But, say, in our fantasy world your iPhone could take a full Internet routing table (it can&#x27;t).  BGP is not designed to deal with very long prefixes (/32 host routes) and in fact most peering agreements will flat out block prefixes longer than a /24 based on policy.<p>BGP on mobile devices would never have been fun and never worked.  If each mobile host that came online required BGP around the world to update it&#x27;s FIB we&#x27;d be in a world of hurt (partially because you can&#x27;t aggregate host routes as you don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re originating transit from).

Cable companies have the argument that its their private network, mostly built with private money, and Netflix, Google, etc, leverage it to reach customers. They should be able to do what they want with it. That&#x27;s an almost slam-dunk argument for anyone who believes in deregulation and privatization. Their best play is to double down on the liberals. That means expanding the message. Yeah, without net neutrality cable companies could shut down startups, but that&#x27;s really esoteric for your average liberal.[1] They want to hear about things like consumer protection, universal access, the digital divide, and assuring access of diverse viewpoints to media. These are people who will fight tooth and nail to keep public access stations nobody watches on the air, so figure out how to leverage those sentiments.

I’ve been through these kinds of problems enough times that I know, more often than not, if you’re going to debug one thing in a piece of code, you’re going to debug a bunch of things, so you might as well add the debug code early and leverage it throughout the whole process.

It takes the same amount of time to write debug code earlier as it does later, but earlier means you can use it to speed debugging of all those not-as-hard bugs along the way.</i><p>It&#x27;s not test-driven-development obviously, but am I wrong in assuming that this preemptive custom debugging is rare in  game development?

Because it made it easier for the drivers to drive optimally, but in doing so reduced the entertainment and variability of how the race unfolds.

The DRS is almost a no-brainer, but the KERS can require some finesse. Hit it into the turn, on the follow through, coming out of the straight? That depends on who you&#x27;re up against, how his car performs compared to yours, and how you&#x27;re looking on fuel & tires.<p>Also, FIA banned traction and launch control a few years ago, specifically because they were worried the computer was doing too much driving.

How many Canadians are going to work in China? It&#x27;s feel-good rhetoric but ultimately it&#x27;s just an excuse to flood richer nations with workers from poorer nations.<p>These low pay schemes are <i>because</i> of the restrictions instead of <i>in spite</i> of them. If we had open borders and none of this visa nonsense, why would some guy from china work under market wage when he could just as easily apply for the same jobs as everyone else in the market? A major flood of applicants might lower wages, but not nearly as much than these schemes do, because the worker is basically &quot;paying&quot; for his right to be in the country through lower wages.<p>These visa schemes are a modern-day indentured servitude, plain and simple.",1399515905

He knows what speeds he needs to be at, at specific points on the track, to optimally corner, etc.<p>Not to mention that the precise limits of what speed can be achieved where will change as track temperature and conditions change.

I've been pleased with how many ""failings"" posted are sweet compliments; playful inside jokes; and well-worded, well-meaning suggestions.<p>If anyone would like to try it out, I've made a promo code, ""HACKERNEWS"".

1135942,comment,1133615,1134071,0,0,donaq,,,"By that token, law is also trivia. The thing is, how successful do you think the internet is going to be? It has, within a few decades, permeated almost every aspect of our lives, and it seems set to get even bigger. An analogy in human history would be, say, society itself. Before that, people lived in isolated subsistence-level, hunter-gatherer tribes. When bigger societies emerged, a member of such a tribe could have made the argument that knowing the rules of such a society was useless trivia because it wasn't <i>really</i> useful, as opposed to knowing how to hunt and recognize berries that aren't poisonous. These tribes either integrated into larger societies or became extinct.<p>Needless to say, I do not know the future of human civilization or whether the internet will continue to be important or even retain the same structure, but it seems reasonable to suppose that it will, because as more technology is built on top of it or that utilizes it (all our computers and mobile devices, web apps, etc), it becomes more indispensable, subject to the emergence of disruptive substitutes.<p>Forgive this rambling comment, but I have a point, which is this: I think that as more widely-used abstractions are built on top of a basic structure, this structure becomes an increasingly important reality unto itself and the mechanics of it <i>become</i> deep knowledge, at least where us humans are concerned. Also, I would point out that though I agree with you on math, physics and chemistry, to most people, those are useless trivia too.",1266544698

A random example: last week I nearly bit off my own hand while watching someone use a browser while giving a presentation. Every time she wanted to go to a different webpage, she would fumble around for a minute, get confused and then <i>quit the browser</i>. After restarting and letting it load her homepage (not Google), she would use the search bar to look for her goal.<p>So, ok, computers are tricky. Programmers are unhelpful and unkind. Designers focus on flash and not helpful visual cues. Blah, blah blah. But c'mon, why would anyone think that you need to quit the application to get somewhere else?  You don't quit your email program to read or write another email. You don't leave your house to visit another room.

1135903,comment,1135518,1135518,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"The stuff about the human interface for musical instruments is just hokey.  It lends no support to the author's argument.  Acoustic instruments have the user interfaces that they have because the physics of sound production made more usable interfaces impractical to build.  And, indeed, now that electronics have enabled alternative means of sound production, the design of more intuitive and usable interfaces for musical instruments is an active area of research and development.  Likewise, musical notation is an anachronism that has survived more as a matter of tradition than on the merits of the design.  If you take a look at the design of most MIDI sequencer software, you'll find that piano roll notation has largely replaced traditional music notation as the default interface because it is so much more intuitive.<p>Most people who attempt to learn to play an acoustic instrument take lessons for a few months and eventually quit because the user interfaces are so difficult to learn.  The idea that software should in any way emulate this sort of design is incomprehensible to me, since the design of software is not nearly so constrained as the design of a physical instrument.  On a trumpet, you have to hold down the first and third valve key and extend a slide by a precise amount with your ring finger to play the D above middle C, but the fingering for D an octave higher is completely different.  If you're playing in any kind of a group, you also have to be aware that your instrument is really a B flat instrument and transpose the notes accordingly to play along with everyone else.  If your software had a bizarre interface like this, nobody would buy it unless absolutely no other alternative existed.",1266543119

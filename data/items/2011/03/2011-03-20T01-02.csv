I agree. To apply in a way I think is thorough, takes at least 8 hours of work - a day's work. That's doing the videos and providing cogent responses to all the questions. Sure you can do it in 20 minutes if you want to rush through, but I don't do that.<p>Now a day's work is not a great amount. However, the problem is that it is a ""special case"" application that really can't be reused. Y Combinator wants you to tailor an in-depth presentation for them. That's fine. More power to them. However, it says something to me that in return they offer zero feedback. Zero.",1300586163

Rejection is part of the road the road to success. Also, if you took away from my post that I am giving up, I probably could have been clearer. I am not giving up.

The fact that some news organizations don't trade coverage for access does not imply that those organizations are producing good news.  It just means that they're not committing a specific (albeit common) sin.<p>In other news ""both sides don't like my coverage"" does not imply ""my coverage is good/fair/balanced/etc"".<p>However, it would be nice if you provided a link to all of the interview, not just the results of your edit.",1300583273

Under the current system, the recently deceased authors book would earn royalties for his estate for 75 years. Grand children he's never met will benefit financially from his work. We grant them a monopoly, and get no social benefit. This is a perversion of the intent of copyright, which was to promote more creative work.<p>Simple inheritance is categorically different. Your inheriting money from your family has no negative impact on others. But if you inherit an intellectual monopoly, it is taking something away from the public good for no benefit. That may be acceptable for a reasonably limited term. But how anyone can imagine a copyright term that extends across multiple generations is reasonable is beyond me.",1325735946

The key isn't creating an EPUB, it's creating a <i>good-looking</i> EPUB.<p>This stuff is hard and I totally understand your pain - I'm the digital product manager over at Blurb.com (ebook!). We're primarily focused on fixed-layout epubs which ensures that the picture you laid next to the text will always stay in the same place. Reflowable epubs are technologically easier to create but the output can vary so much that it makes the author look sloppy at times. Not cool.<p>You can create a Blurb book and then convert it to an ebook for $1.99. We create them to Apple's strict epub standards so you can even submit it to their iBookstore. No DRM. :) (<a href=""http://blurb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blurb.com</a>)<p>Looking forward, I think we are going to see a larger focus on fixed-layout ebooks in the future as more tablets are created (Kindle Fire, iPad) and authors see the limitations of reflowable ebooks. I'm not knocking reflowable ebooks, but just writing a book in itself is a huge undertaking (congratulations!); trying to maintain formatting and a clean layout afterwards feels like you're being punished.<p>As to anyone else who has gone through ebook creation/conversion with Blurb (or elsewhere), feel free to send me a note or comment with your questions.

Now, besides the families and friends of your troops, this ""war"" doesn't affect the general population at all. There are no counter-measures or attacks by the enemy in your soil, no adverse effects on economy (except some overspending), etc.<p>So people in the US, from Idaho to New Orleans, could care less if there is a war happening or not. Even the ""support our troops"" is mostly a goodwill/political statement, a self-adhesive ribbon for your car, not a matter of life and death.<p>Now, what happens when two countries go to an actual war, historically, is much more grave: hundreds of thousands (or even millions) die, their cities are bombed, there is compulsory drafting, thousands of refuges, food shortages and a huge toil on the nation's economy. You haven't see any such war, at least since WWII (and even that one you fought with minimum impact, --with the exception of Pearl Harbor--, thanks to the US's convenient distance from Germany/Japan).",1325734762

It is the major reason that I am not optimistic about it changing in the 10-20 year outlook baring a major shift in how software is assembled. The problem with those VB and access solutions is they inevitably do not scale. I think they are great for empowering people but I have seen the pattern too many times where one of these solutions outlives it's intent and becomes a critical system at a company that then pours far more money into keeping it alive than they ever would have should they have hired a developer in the first place. Some of the best environments I have seen is organizations that encourage business people to solution in access, but once a homegrown solution hits a certain size they hand it off as a prototype to a development team to turn it into a robust solution. Therein lies the issue, the tool that empower people inherently lead to sloppy solutions that further the software crisis, the tools that help manage quality and scalability don't empower the lay person. No one is even remotely close to crossing that chasm. If anything web apps have made the two that much further apart.",1325734633

The stuff about fully loaded CPUs was wandering off into the theoretical realm about CPU power consumption variance in general.<p>For whatever it may be worth, I couldn't find idle power consumption for my notebook's CPU, but it is possible to come up with a worst-case estimate by taking the battery capacity and dividing by the runtime. Apple specifies ""up to"" 7 hours. While that is of course hard to achieve, I think it's fair to use that figure when looking at idle power use. The battery is 50Wh, so we can figure that the computer as a whole is using at most about 7W when idle. The i7-2677M CPU is specced to use up to 17W all by its lonesome when running flat out, so that's a substantial increase, especially when you take into account the fact that the base 7W idle-ish consumption is for everything in the computer, not just the CPU.",1325733015

There was a professor who gave his intro CS students an exam where they were supposed to interpret code. Of course, most of them had no idea what they were reading. The statement ""X = X + 1"" is (as a mathematical equation) garbage, even though it's legitimate in a conventional CS context (whereby '=' represents assignment). So almost all of the students interpreted the code incorrectly.<p>What separated the (future) successes from the failures was not how accurate their interpretations were, but whether they were consistent. The students who came up with consistent interpretations of these (a priori) meaningless symbols and could rigorously apply them were able to grok programming-- through trial and error, they picked up the actual meanings over time. The ones who weren't consistent, who just didn't ""get"" that these symbols had rigorous and inflexible meanings, were the ones who failed.<p>I actually think this style of rigor in thinking can be learned, even for average people, but it takes time. You can't go from zero to fluency in one semester. The problem (of American mediocrity in mathematical thinking, at least over the bottom 90 percentiles) is similar to what comes up in affirmative action debates: we're addressing it 18 years too late. In the US, many students never encounter mathematical proof or computer programming, except among the elite (e.g. USAMO, IMO). These aren't impossibly hard.

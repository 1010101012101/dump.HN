Plus (a) several of the remaining 66 probably will raise series A rounds in the future, and (b) there are certainly more that could have but either got acquired (Reddit, Omnisio) or made it to profitability on angel money (Wufoo, Bountii).",1219640341

I'm of the opinion that when you're spending crazy hours in a chair, it's not something you want to skimp on.

285656,comment,285600,285600,0,0,ivank,,,"Right now, I use Tree Styles Tabs as a sort of ""temporary history"", since I got tired of thinking about which tabs I should keep open. I'm also using the Ctrl-Tab extension just like Alt-Tab on windows (can't live without it). With a vertical tab list, I open almost everything in a new tab. My depth first search habits are limited by seeing the tab indentations and knowing where the root is.<p>My ideal tab behavior would involve merging browser history and tabs into an infinite vertical scroll. Pages with unsaved state (form data, important flash objects, AJAX ""state"") would stay in Firefox's memory until explicitly closed. All ""boring"" pages would stay in memory for a few hours, then convert to a URL+scroll-position+selected-text object. Combine this with single-keystroke tab tagging and I think that tabs will finally feel like a reliable part of the browser, not just a taskbar-inspired hack.<p>edit: Ideally, desktop applications would work in a similar way. Right now I have to keep ~30 windows open because I can't remember which serialize state perfectly, and which don't.",1219638476

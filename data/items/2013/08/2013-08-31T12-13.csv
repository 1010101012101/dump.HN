6306720,comment,6304752,6305675,5,0,mr_luc,,,"Local, to the extent of the family.<p>If I have kids, to what extent are they &#x27;mine&#x27;?<p>That&#x27;s the question here.<p>So far, in America, the answer has been &quot;you can&#x27;t abuse them physically, fail to provide food and clothes, or make them work&quot; (although there&#x27;s actually a lot of leeway with that last one).<p>Other than that, go nuts!<p>Teach them that UFOs are real, that democracy is evil, to resist the hand of the man, or that money doesn&#x27;t matter. Or any other radicalism. You made them, they&#x27;re yours.<p>Obviously, a stance like that won&#x27;t please everyone. You&#x27;re making a decision about an appreciable portion of a kid&#x27;s life, and since most kids aren&#x27;t going to get themselves declared emancipated minors, leaving it up to the parents may not appear to be a decision in favor of freedom. But I think it is. Until kids are old enough, they&#x27;ve got to be treated like <i>someone&#x27;s</i> responsibility, and I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where the weirdness of parents has no chance to hop generations.<p>My parents were weirdos, weird enough that, when I flunked multiple classes in 9th grade, they let me try college, where I got straight A&#x27;s my first semester. At the moment I work 3 months a year from a beach in South America. Had the system not given my parents the freedom to do seemingly irrational things in my interest, I have no idea where I&#x27;d have ended up, because the system was wrong and my parents were right.",1377953927

6306713,comment,6306047,6306047,7,0,tvanantwerp,,,"Maybe it&#x27;s because I work for a nonprofit, but this piece seems like speculation and paranoia. Oh, so this group Peers is actually funded by a handful of wealthy patrons? Guess what--all nonprofits make 90%+ of their revenues from the top 10% or less of donors. Some nonprofits only really have ONE donor. That&#x27;s just how the nonprofit sector works. All of it. By the author&#x27;s logic, the Red Cross is astroturf.<p>I think it&#x27;s a fair point that these companies aren&#x27;t building a sharing economy. They&#x27;re building companies that let people sell individual surplus of capital or time or skills through a convenient platform. That might not be sharing, but there&#x27;s real economic value in that. They wouldn&#x27;t be able to take a cut from these small transactions unless they genuinely offered some valuable service to the other parties. I just recently stayed in a wonderful AirBNB apartment while on a trip, and I <i>know</i> I wouldn&#x27;t have managed that without the AirBNB service, and I <i>know</i> I would have paid more and gotten less for a hotel.<p>The author assumes--wrongly, from my experience in public policy--that the status quo organizations and regulations exist for the common good. Some do, but many don&#x27;t. Lots of bad laws and crooked organizations raise unjustifiable barriers to entry--not just for Silicon Valley start-ups, but for the mom-and-pop businesses too.<p>I can&#x27;t say for sure whether Peers is good, bad, or neutral. I can say with certainty that this article is heavily biased, ignorant of how most nonprofits work, and ignorant of the public policy process.",1377953760

6306701,comment,6304842,6306529,2,0,Houshalter,,,"The author makes some good points, but I still disagree. If you look through history, people did barbaric things. Slavery happened. Genocides happened. In wars, the winning side would sometimes rape all the women in the conquered village before killing them. Don&#x27;t even get into medieval torture devices.<p>This quote from HPMOR is a bit long, but relevant and completely sums up the problem:<p>&quot;A few centuries earlier - I think it was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and - roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good clean fun. And I&#x27;ll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built, the way people are built to <i>feel</i> inside - is that they hurt when they see their friends hurting. Someone inside their circle of concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch, an off-switch labeled &#x27;enemy&#x27; or &#x27;foreigner&#x27; or sometimes just &#x27;stranger&#x27;. That&#x27;s how people are, if they don&#x27;t learn otherwise.<p>You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where &#x27;I vas only followink orders&#x27; is something <i>everyone knows</i> the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century they would&#x27;ve called it honourable fealty. Do you think you&#x27;re, you&#x27;re just <i>genetically</i> better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you&#x27;d been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you&#x27;d realize <i>all on your own</i> that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your circle of concern?&quot;",1377953336

The only power you as an individual consumer have against vendors and producers is the power of choice - the choice to buy which product at what price at which location. No matter whether you have plenty of money or have to turn each currency-unit twice before spending it, if you forget about this you will get pilfered. You will lose track of current market prices for commodities and end up paying through the nose because the vendor in your location has noticed he can increase prices without losing business, thus increasing profits. Others who have less to spend will take their business elsewhere and before you know it you&#x27;ll have created yourself the groceries-equivalent of an Apple store.<p>So if you happen to see fewer and fewer people swapping products in their baskets because they are not on sale or using coupons or hands of small change or whatnot, take heed and do some comparison shopping.",1377952775

Because, as you wrote yourself:<p><i>Its intended use was crop destruction.[...]</i><p>And from WP:<p><i>The goal was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.[49] The program was also a part of a general policy of forced draft urbanization, which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S. dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.[8][9]</i><p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare</a>:<p><i>Defoliants are used to quickly kill vegetation and deny its use for cover and concealment. It can also be used against agriculture and livestock to promote hunger and starvation.</i><p>How the hell was that policy supposed not to hurt children or farmers not participating in the war ?<p>&quot;We destroyed their country and burned it but we didn&#x27;t think it would starve anyone or people would die as a result&quot;. Do you use nuclear weapon to destroy infrastructure and when asked about human casualties then declare &quot;Our intention was only to speed up the neutralization of city infrastructure, not to kill anyone.&quot; ?<p><i>> Agent Orange was definitely used to gain the upper hand in the war.<p>The point of fighting in a war is to gain the upper hand.</i><p>So... agent orange was used to win the war, which is my point. And yes forced and global defoliation qualify as warfare tactics. And so agent orange was used because of the warfare advantage it would give. It was used as a weapon against a resource (crop) without a care for the people on it. So yes it was used against people.<p>PS: My main point is that Agent Orange was used as a weapon on the ground of its intended consequences. That at that time they didn&#x27;t fully consider the chemical effects on humans is highly convenient and suspect to me. Hence my reaction to the &quot;it wasn&#x27;t an anti-personnel weapon&quot;.<p>And to support that, from the first WP page:<p><i>Many experts at the time, including Arthur Galston, the biologist who developed and intensively studied 2,4,5-T and TCDD, opposed herbicidal warfare, due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the United Nations charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons.[46][55]</i>",1377952003

There may be a lawsuit, yes, and there will likely be a hit to their share value, but it&#x27;s that same old problem of trading short-term safety for long-term freedoms.<p>It&#x27;s a good way for them to put the money where the mouth is. Yes, I&#x27;m aware of the &quot;requirements&quot; to allow monitoring equipment; I&#x27;m specifically calling for the executives of these companies to engage in civil disobedience. Politicians are famously sensitive to anything that actually gets the attention of the _masses_. Like, shutting down Google due to court-ordered monitoring and Google refusing to comply. How long would the NSA endure such a standoff before backing down with some weasel-words about &quot;coming to an agreement&quot;?",1377950420

Obviously this varies from command to command, but... anyway that's probably more big-picture than you're thinking of.<p>One small way (small as in every day life for people not big Marine Corps issues) is this notion I'd guess I'd describe as ""maximal accountability"" for your actions. Which is good up to a point but when coupled with the zero-defect thing, tthen suddenly you're living a life where there's no such thing as ""not a big deal.""<p>This also translates into being treated like a child when you're not in a combat zone, with curfews, checking in, signing in and out on your own personal time, and so forth. I get why it happens but as a 30-year-old guy when I got out, I was getting a little too old to be THAT accountable to someone else.<p>Ironically, when it came to my professional life as a Marine (all easily verifiable btw if you google my name in case you're wondering if I'm another poser) there was no simpler time than being in Iraq or afloat. Bullshit levels were at a minimum because there were real things to accomplish. That's coincidentally why I love being a programmer. :)",1332251843

You have to - gasp - actually understand what the fuck you are doing to get things working correctly. I don't see the problem. As others have pointed out, git is not meant for the beginner, it's not meant for an average user, it's for people who want an extremely powerful VCS. If you start catering to people who are not from the latter group, you are missing both the point and the purpose of git.<p><i>>Personally, I don't think either UNIX or GIT made the trade off between usability and power, usability was simply ignored.</i><p>False. What you are talking about isn't usability. It's <i>accessibility</i>. And I actually agree with you that git is very inaccessible for someone who's never worked with a VCS before (that's how I started with git, thrown into cold water). The same goes for UNIX, to a degree. Now, usability and accessibility aren't necessarily orthogonal concepts. They aren't parallel, either, though. When you try to improve the accessibility of a program, you will arrive at a point where you will have to make tradeoffs with the usability of the program. And what I am saying is that when you reach that point, <i>stop</i>. Accessibility isn't worth sacrificing usability over.<p><i>>Actually it's one of the best things to do in software, you'll want to look at companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft who all dumb things down</i><p>Argumentum ad populum. Just because those companies do it doesn't imply that it's good. And in fact, they just prove my point: what they are doing is harming general purpose computing in the long run, and for everyone. Microsoft and Apple are aiming to turn computers into one-to-many consumption devices. Facebook and Google are privacy nightmares and impact the open web negatively with their monopolies.<p><i>>Imagine the UI for aircraft was so horrible that to get from NY to LA you needed an aerospace degree.</i><p>Your ridiculous hyperbole isn't making your point more valid. No, you shouldn't need to have an aerospace degree to fly from NY to LA. But you should have a grasp of how to get from NY to LA, not demand ""I want to get to LA"". The same goes for search engines. No, I don't expect people to understand the math behind page rank. But I expect them <i>to be able to use a search machine</i>. If that involves learning to make better search queries, then so be it.<p>Finally, if you want to use a powerful VCS like git, then I'm afraid you <i>have to learn how git works</i>. And not demand that it made be more accessible for people unwilling to learn how it's used. For people who want a simple (D)VCS with a much better accessibility (and consequently a lot less power), there's always bzr.<p><i>>PS. Mac has all the power of UNIX but with out a retarded interface meaning no tradeoff was actually necessary.</i><p>False. As others have pointed out, OS X is a horrible, crippled excuse for a UNIX, albeit with a shiny UI on top (whose usability is debatable and in my opinion horrible). I don't even know why developers put up with it. If you aren't specifically developing for OS X/iOS (same goes for Windows), there's literally <i>no</i> reason to not use GNU/Linux or one of the BSDs.",1332251257

The fact that Haskell is always curried means that you always have to be aware of currying.<p>There are many kinds of problem solving.  One is ""how do I solve {x} using {y} in some clever way.""  Haskell is great for those folk.  Another is ""How do I solve {x}.""<p>Here's one way to distinguish these two groups.  The first sends ""look at my cute solution to {x}"" to their friends while the latter say they send ""look at what I built"".<p>To put it another way, when a user community is dominated by folks who write papers/essays about the tools, you've got a tool for folks who want to play with tools.<p>Haskell is wonderful for a subset of those folks who care a lot about tools, specifically those folks who think that mathematical purity is important.<p>There are other goals.",1332250372

And what's happened since? Microsoft have lost money hand over fist on them with little genuine strategic gain other than saying that they were in those spaces.<p>Social is a pretty rapidly evolving space at the moment but other than Facebook is anyone really making money there? Google have made several plays with limited success, Twitter is interesting but has an unclear business model and most of the social start ups range from the uninspiring to the niche to the sort of thing that Facebook is just going to copy and crush if it takes off.<p>And even Facebook, anecdotally at least, seems to be getting tired. I hear so many people talking of irritation with it, drifting away, even closing accounts. The figures continue to show growth but among the sort of people who were early adopters I'm personally seeing a complete lack of engagement with it.<p>So yes, it would make Apple a player in social but really, is that something they want?<p>In terms of keeping it out of the hands of Google or Facebook or whoever, if you think it's a good acquisition, you should buy it because of that. If you think it's a bad acquisition then you shouldn't care, in fact you should probably want them to buy it to have them waste a billion dollars.<p>Oh, and I loved the idea ""they fix Ping and monitize it"".

In software, researchers and architects.<p>(2) Infantry, by far the largest component, responsible for the core task of taking and holding territory.  In software, most programmers.<p>(3) MPs (also quartermaster, community liason, etc.) who maintain order in the held territory.  In software, debugging specialists and release engineers.<p>The problem I have with the OP's metaphor is that the ""starter"" and ""architect"" roles are both part of (1) and many people actually can do both pretty well.  Similarly, the ""debugger"" and ""finisher"" roles are both (3) and also combine well.  What's really unfortunate is that (2) seems entirely absent even though in real life it consumes most of the time and resources on a project.  These are the folks who take mostly-complete designs from a starter/architect, and get most of the code mostly working before the serious integration/stress testing occur and the debugger/finisher come to the fore.  In other words, most of your colleagues most of the time.

I rest my foot upon my sacred BeBox and attempt to engage.<p>I kind of feel on a near-/mid-term view that the ""age of the OS war"", wherein the OS was the central watering point for app vendors, is dead and over.  For the customer, for the user, it no longer really matters what OS is on the computer, as long as the thing works. If the thing has an App store, they'll use it.  End of platform worries.<p>Yes, I really said it: the proprietary OS is dead.  And so what we're seeing here with the way that Microsoft is addressing Win8 et al., is the long-tail/carcass of the 'one OS to rule us all' monster doctrines of the 70's and 80's, actually sort of a bit stinky, still left out on the playing field.  The reality is, the OS value to the user is dead or dying. Most seriously useful apps in use will run on whatever is available, hardware-wise, and of course that means x86, ARM, and so on.  A cross-platform, multi-build target codebase can be quite well served from left to right on the spectrum, if the proper tools are used, and those tools are done and out there.<p>Even OSX is starting to rot a bit in the sense that its OS vendor seems to be acceptably abandoning their Developers, or forcing them to choose sides, in order to control access to and rights of the User market.  OSX is going to get less and less 'open and general purpose' while becoming, itself, a huge capital in the real $$-making realm of computers: selling candy apps on commodity hardware, directly to the user.<p>Developers as a reason for OS lock-in?  Well, I think there that we're headed for walled gardens, with the trick being that ultimately, now that anyone can build their own walled garden for free or next to nothing, the OS as a host for Big Apps doesn't matter so much, so OS product managers are going to reduce the general-purpose/free nature of it.<p>If one builds ones app stack from boot to user with whatever one needs, and if the app is good enough, people will abandon making the OS decision as a necessary 'accessory', soon enough.  It has happened many times, and now recently with iOS/Android app stores, its a huge win for the makers of hardware, and some of the makers of software.<p>Another thing though is that there is still nothing, and I mean nothing, stopping Samsung from having their own wide-open developer/OS front, in face of Microsoft.  Nothing stopping them, but for groupthink.  Say Samsung build and deliver a small footprint Linux machine for watching movies and home content, with the difference being the machine is 100% open, has its own onboard compiler/build-system, access to a common App store (namespace) .. well .. all this is a deadly affront to Windows8, come to think of it.  I'm sensing ""Panic!"" in the product.<p>We just simply don't need Big OS.  If your app is well-written, it can run on them all.  Or, if you want, you can have your own OS and App sphere; CPU dies support such ideologies, they just haven't happened yet because there isn't .. yet .. a demand of the general public for having computer systems that will self-sustain through development.<p>Some hardware company will profit from this idea breaking through, soon enough, I think ..",1332248763

And that's before considering the validity of their data collection method.<p>The general OSS project tend to start when someone has an itch to scratch. They build something which solves that problem and upload the source somewhere. The next step is determined by 2 questions:<p>1) Does the developer keep having the same itch?\n2) Does the developer get support from a company or someone else who has the same itch?<p>If not, the code becomes part of the Sourceforge wasteland of unmaintained, unused code.<p>Github is an interesting attempt to keep the itch-scratching alive by making forking easy, but when there are 10 different forks for similar functionality, all by people of unknown coding ability, rewriting or reforking becomes the safest option.",1332248541

When we were first bootstrapping (no investors, angels or the like, just some money scraped together) the first thing we spent money on was (expensive) legal advice, mostly because we knew it was the only thing we needed right then that we couldn't teach ourselves quickly enough.<p>If you're still in startup mode, the following two questions should help you make the decision:<p>- do I need it right now?<p>- can I spare the money right now, if not: can I make a deal with my IP attorneys where they agree to bill me later? (just think about the money you need to spend the coming couple of months, the total estimated cost over 20 years is completely irrelevant at this point)<p>If both questions are answered with a 'yes', do it.  Because if you need it right now, it doesn't matter how inconvenient the distraction from working on your product is right now, as a founder you'll just have to deal with it.  And if you don't need it, don't do it, because I'm sure you can find some other thing you need to do 'right now'.<p>Don't let the idea that you already spent money on the provisional patent cloud your judgement about whether you should put more money into this.  If you can't come to a rational decision, and the prior expense is what pulls you over the fence emotionally, it's probably better to cut your losses.<p>Good luck, these kinds of decisions are hard, especially deciding whether you 'need' something.

Alone in the sense that I've only ever had two or three real friends, and I often go for weeks without having a conversation with another person.<p>As a kid I was fine with this.  I was the guy who always sat by himself during lunch and recess, and nobody bothered me and I felt fine.  I stayed the same until my senior year of high school, when I was struck by a burning need to make friends, meet girls and stop being alone all the damn time.  I made some friends that year, but we were high school seniors, so we all moved off to college and I never heard from them again.<p>Now I'm in my third year of college, I have no friends and I can't believe how hard it is to meet people.

436405,comment,436331,436398,0,0,palish,,,"A friend was answering some programming/logic questions for a potential employer.  In addition to a many good programming questions, there was also this logic question:<p><i>""A man was sentenced to death, but the king wanted to give him a last chance. He asked the man to choose from one of the three knights that were there. One of the knights was the Knight of Life, and he always told the truth. The second Knight was the Knight of Death, and he always told lies. The third knight was the Knight of the Dungeon. He sometimes lied and sometimes told the truth. If the man chose the Knight of Death, he would be executed before sunset. If he chose the Knight of Life, he would be acquitted and set free right away. If he chose the Knight of the Dungeon, he would spend the rest of his life imprisoned in the Dungeon. The man was allowed to ask the three knights one question each.
Thus, he asked the fat knight, ""What is the name of this tall knight?"" The reply was, ""He is the Knight of Life."" He asked the small knight, ""What is the name of this tall knight?"" The reply was, ""He is the Knight of Death."" Then he asked the tall knight, ""Who are you?"" ""I am the Knight of the Dungeon"" was the reply. After that, the man was able to correctly choose the Knight of Life, and was set free immediately.
Who is the Knight of Life, and who are the other two knights?""</i><p>This puzzle seemed beautiful to me because it was so pure.  If you can understand English, then you have the potential to solve it.<p>My friend solved it in about forty seconds, according to him.  I solved it in over twenty minutes, and only after being wrong once.<p>I am an extremely slow programmer.  I have had the good fortune of being around many productive programmers, so I know this to be the case.  I used to make excuses as to why I was so.  But in the end, it doesn't really matter;  I am wrong 90% more often than I am correct, and I act stupidly most of the time.  My memory is so horrible that I routinely forget the start of the sentences I am writing.  I often re-read what I write (be it English or C++) over ten times before I am satisfied it means what I meant.  My mathematical skills are a wash.  (I still don't even understand the meaning and utility of 'e', and not for lack of trying.)  My mind's eye is blind; I find it almost impossible to imagine what a given figure should look like, if I am about to draw it, so something such as Paul's painting <a href=""http://bookshop.gfu.net/AxCMSTemplates_GFU/pics/products/0133708756.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bookshop.gfu.net/AxCMSTemplates_GFU/pics/products/013...</a> seems nothing short of magic.

436404,comment,436331,436394,0,0,unalone,,,"Then try and understand that there's no such <i>thing</i> as average intelligence, only different intelligence. People learn different things differently. Part of it's context, background. Part of it's just how minds work. Jobs had a foster father that was apparently very aggressive, and he inherited that trait. He had an open mind, certainly was good at learning from things, but some of his personality he got from the people who raised him.<p>Nothing is immediate. Everything takes years and years of work. So whatever you want to do, start now! Begin learning. Learn everything. If you ever have a question, or wonder why something is the way it is, ask! You'll learn more, more, more, and eventually you'll find a question without an answer. That's when you begin work.<p>Forgive me for being immodest and talking about myself, but that's the story I know and I hope it helps. When I was really young, I was surrounded by books, and learned how to read when I was 2 or 3. I'd read quite a lot by middle school, and so when we were asked to write things, I wrote by copying a lot of the things I'd read from different sources. Some people called it a matter of intelligence, but it wasn't: I had just read a lot, and so had a wide palette to blatantly steal from. At the same time, I had computers around since I was an infant, but I'd never really learned about things like forums until I was about 13 - which from some stories is pretty damn old online! From there, though, I learned a lot about communities, and tried making my on site two years later. It was all a matter of timing: if I'd discovered forums at 19, my first site would have launched a lot later. As it happens, now I'm working on a site for writers, and I'm combining a lot of the things I've learned in the past to make it happen.<p>Passion's the real key, and from what you've written you've got that. Now you need to make that passion last. You can just go out and start trying things, but be warned in advance that they won't seem impressive at first. Each one gets a little bit better. And the more perspective you've got, the more this happens. Something you thought was perfect seems awful once you see things other people have made - I know this happens in both writing and web design, and I'm sure it must happen in every other field imaginable. It'll take time; nothing happens overnight. Not even for child prodigies: Mozart spent 6 years immersed in music before he became a prodigal violinist, after all, and he had a father who'd spent his life learning the craft that Mozart learned and then mastered.<p>Never let generalizations stop you from getting something done. Don't worry about intelligence. Worry about doing things, thinking things. Let other people compliment you after the fact, and if you get things done they will. Focus your effort on accomplishment and you'll be guaranteed to succeed.",1232100748

I do NOT need a friend/girlfriend to be happy and to feel fulfilled. If I have to, I'll go by myself just fine, thank you!"" OTOH, nobody wants to befriend someone who really wants a friend, maybe just any friend. You can't seek for friendship, it will seek for you.<p>Third, you should make up your mind about what you want. What do you want from your friends should you become blessed with one? What do you want to talk about with them? What do you want to do with them? Unless you know what you want, you'll just keep bumping into friends or ""friends"" who want to do their stuff. Nobody is going to come and probe you for subjects that you might want to talk about, everyone just settles for some topic they know you know too. Also, being occasionally brave enough to talk about what YOU want to talk about is a great device to weed out people who can't or won't align with your interests. For example, if you want to talk about life, start doing that and you'll soon find out who will bounce back and who simply can't handle it.<p>Generally, whatever it is that isn't working will just keep happening again and again until you find a way to change yourself, causing different and possibly more desirable things to keep happening.",1232100656

I wasn't trying to go specific about the detail, just some general feeling I have towards jQuery.<p>I guess I'd better explain why I feel so.<p>I was experimenting with JavaScript a couple of years ago before jQuery/Prototype/etc took off. IE6 was the absolutely major browser back then, but I was expecting JavaScript to work both in Firefox and IE6. You couldn't imagine how frustrated I felt trying to get anything work cross-platform flawlessly.<p>Then I came across jQuery. I think it was still in an ""alpha"" stage then -- the whole idea was awesome, but with many bugs (I even worked one out and had John patched it with my code). I was amazed at the way John solved the problems of JavaScript (personally I do not like JavaScript), saving a lot of trouble for me.<p>Later I moved on and was not involved with JavaScript for quite a while. But I still kept an eye on the evolution of jQuery. I was really excited by the animation effects jQuery provides (how could one possibly achieve that in such a language with broken support? He must be a genius!). As for the 1.3 release, I think ""future detection"" probably solves the cross-platform issue once and for all. That's what I meant when I said the word ""patched"".<p>Forgive my broken English -- it's not my mother tongue :|",1232100091

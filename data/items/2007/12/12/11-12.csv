So the odds can't be much less than 1/(number of planets in the universe)<p>That argument takes for granted that the probability space comprises only the things in our observable universe. In other words, it claims that there doesn't exist anything that we don't already know about. That's a false premise.<p>re: singularity. I think we are already part-cyborgs. For all practical purposes, Internet is a part of me--it's a sense organ. Ask yourself, what would you rather lose: your sense of hearing, or the technologies of the last 100 years? For me, it's the former, any day of the week. What it means to be human changes continuously, and has been changing since before we were officially human. Now it's changing faster than ever before, but it changed faster than ever before at almost every point in human history.",1197460178

So the odds can't be much less than 1/(number of planets in the universe)<p>\nAs for the singularity, I believe the point is the nature of being a human will change. The 19th century man will fit into our world just fine. A ""regular"" man might not fit into a world where we're all part cyborgs. You are correct in that it's the same unknowable impenetrable future state for us and the 19th century guy, but the idea is that the nature of change will be different in the next 100 years than it ever has been -- because it deals with what it means to be human. <p>\nThe Fermi Paradox, Drake Equation, and the quest for life is one of my pet subjects. I like it because it is pseudo-science -- and I mean that in a good way. We simply have no means of actually performing experiments, since our knowledge of life consists of just one example for a brief period of time. I am tempted to think that life is just about everywhere in the universe, but heck if I know. If there is life everywhere, then where is everybody?",1197458068

4369854,comment,4366203,4368069,19,0,Fleuri,,,"When talking about education in China, given that I just graduated from a chinese high school last year(I'm chinese), I think I can have a different view-point from others looking outside.<p>The fact is that, chinese students indeed have really really lots of things to learn in the subject of science, especially math, but something has missed, gravely. For example, the spirit of science. In china, students are told to be well-behaved, from the first step of the primary school till you graduated from high school or university, imagine that a 6 year-old boy obliged to wear a red scarf(Honglingjin in chinese) as a sign of being young pioneer(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Pioneers_of_China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Pioneers_of_China</a>), and saying ""Be prepared, to struggle for the cause of Communism!"", that red scarf will accompanied with that boy, untill junior high school, yes, time to step into Communist Youth League, it will end till the university, where you can really choose to join the party or not.<p>Back in to the education, students here will learn truelly lots of knowledges in math, but for what? the love of science? No, for the exam. this is what I really want to talk about, the real main spirit that construct the form of education in China. For a normal student, when it comes to the education, it's the exam, like a hash, no other values, education => exam, study => better grades, pursuit of science => nil. The summit of your life being a student is the GaoKao, takes place once a year, depend and only depend on which you can enter your ideal university. For lots of students, it's the whole family's ""dream"", parents and teachers will say again and again the importance of get good grades in GaoKao, some student even commit suicide when they faild their GaoKao. Maybe you can already feel that something goes wrong, yes, student take ""good"" elementary education(especially in math), but with the misleading of the meaning of education, math, physics, chemistry, are nothing but a game of grades. Can you imagine that in high school, only 2/3 of time you can really learn somthing, and the 3rd year of the high school is a full-time practice of topics in exam, everything you are told to do and really do is solving wired and meaningless topics. After doing all this, when you finish the GaoKao, it's done, it's the very end of study, lots of students know nothing about what they should do in the future, because the game finished, and their's no grades for struggling.<p>You know, after GaoKao, a lot of chinese students go study in foreign universites(especially US) for the sake of, for example, Freedom. When it comes to me(I'm going to France this year), I nearly think that I'm a ""survivor"" of the form of education in China, I know what I really want, the high school was almost  a ""prison of spirit"" for me, so it's really really exiciting when I graduated, I can really choose what I want to learn, start a startup company, study the real science but not those meaningless topics, do lots of things that aren't ""well-behaved"".<p>We are tend to see only good points of other education systems, because we know our own weakpoints, and the solution may be find in other systems, but the underlying problems are easy to be ignored. I wish this will helps you guys to see a different aspect of education in China, and cherish good things in your education system.",1344681640

If you're already reading this, the thesis[0] might be a somewhat entertaining read.<p>I had a bit different constraints (only hitting frontpage, cms/webserver/... fingerprinting, backend has to be able to do ad-hoc queries for site features), but it's nice to see that the process is always somewhat the same.<p>One of the most interesting things I experienced was, that link crawling works pretty ok for a certain amount of time, but after you have visited a large amount, bloom filters are pretty much the only way to protect against duplication in a memory efficient way.<p>I switched to a hybrid model where I do still check for links, but to limit the needed depth, I switched to using pinboard/twitter/reddit to find new domains. For bootstrapping you can get your hands on zonefiles from places on the internet (e.g. premiumdrops.com) that will keep you from having to crawl too deep pretty fast.<p>These days, I run on a combination of a worker approach with redis as a queue/cache and straight elasticsearch in the backend. I'm pretty happy with the easy scalability.<p>Web Crawlers are a great weekend project, they allow you to fiddle with evented architectures (github sample [1]), scaling a database and seeing the bottlenecks jump from place to place within your architecture. I can only recommend writing one :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.marc-seeger.de/2010/12/09/my-thesis-building-blocks-of-a-scalable-webcrawler/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.marc-seeger.de/2010/12/09/my-thesis-building-blo...</a>

There are a variety of mechanisms by which 1-2% of an acquisition can, in a few failure modes, evaluate to nothing.<p>Here's one: You own 1% (by current dilution) of a company.  This company has not done well.  There exists a company which wants to buy it.<p>The co-founders collectively own 60%, with approximately 30% being owned by investors, and approximately 10% held in aggregate by employees.

And that this is, by the way, it?<p>How the heck did that happen?  The VCs were a little displeased with their return, since this company did poorly, so they played hardball with your founders.  The VCs got $10 million.  (Check those percentages again.  Yeah.  I know.)  This represented 100% of the purchase price, and as it didn't clear the VC's liquidation preference, the common stock is valueless.  You and the founders hold common stock.  For their participation in the deal, the founders were guaranteed 3x $3 million signing bonuses with the acquirer.  This leaves $1 million to pay the lawyers, cover the accountancy costs, etc etc etc.  But hey, because you're such a nice guy, despite your options being worthless they fought hard for you and convinced the acquirer to cut a check for <i>three whole months</i> of your old salary.<p>You would be, of course, free to decline this bonus.  The door is on your left.<p>And, to be fair, you did better than another 1% owner of the company -- employee #1, who went on to greener pastures a year ago.  His shares have vested.

My parents are ethnically Han Chinese. I was born in Canada, raised in America. I carry an American passport. To my neighbors, I'm a  (overseas Chinese); one taxi driver told me that I would be Chinese forever because it's in my blood. So what am I? Moving from the questions of ethnicity, is it possible for a foreigner to immigrate to China and become a Chinese citizen? I suspect the answer is 'no' but I have heard (perhaps from the internet) that one <i>can</i> become a citizen at the invitation of the Chinese government. It seems, being Chinese has more to do with ethnicity AND culture than anything else.<p>While some may deride China for being parochial/uncosmopolitan for this, many countries share this same trait: the majority ethnicity defines citizenship and acceptance. The United States isn't immune from this. Even though I grew up an American (and still consider myself American) I have experienced personal bias and prejudice because of my ethnicity. I got comments from kids about me going to Buddhist church (I'm not Buddhist), using karate in a fight (I don't know any form of martial arts), using chopsticks (this is true), or speaking ""Ching chong, ching chong"" (I am not familiar with this language). High school was hard. Not that it wasn't for any of my white friends who shared the same weight/height/car/popularity class as me, but none of them were ever told to ""Go home.""<p>The big ""but"" here is that I live/lived in the United States. And though there is a history of disenfranchisement as well as evidence of racial bias today, I am more hopeful that <i>you</i> (whoever you are) /can/ become American... not by becoming 'white', but by participating in a society that has the opportunity to change itself as well as the opportunity to change you.<p>It's not clear to me that this is possible in China (i.e. social change to embrace differing ethnicities). The average Chinese (pick any of the Chinese ethnicities) person has very strong feelings about one's identity as it relates to race and language (e.g. some people couldn't believe I was Chinese and couldn't speak Mandarin when I first got to China). In my first trip to China, I made a friend who relayed me this interesting anecdote (this was the late 90's): he (an American) was on a college campus and he engaged in a discussion about race relations in America with a Chinese student. The Chinese student told him: ""There is no racism in China because there aren't any black people."" While the ethnic tensions aren't <i>as</i> visible here, simply ask a Han person how they feel about Uyghers.",1344679255

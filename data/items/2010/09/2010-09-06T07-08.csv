1666202,comment,1665762,1665762,0,0,bugsy,,,"It depends on what your app is. If it's some helpful consumer app that doesn't regulate airplane traffic, doesn't secretly install spyware, doesn't accidentally erase the hard drive when the wrong data is entered, your chance of trouble with customers is low in practice. And nonexistent if you are operating in a different country than your customers.<p>Your greatest risk is that of being sued by a competitor over patents because he would rather do that than create a better product.<p>Incorporating won't help if you are the developer, you are still liable for errors in your own work. Lawsuits against big companies don't usually name individual developers only because they don't have the deep pockets, and because they agreed to testify against their employer confessing their errors in return for being dropped from the lawsuit.<p>If you do want coverage, your option is to get E&O (errors and omissions) insurance which covers liability up to a limit you pay for, and only covers you during the time you pay for it. So if your program is out in the wild and you are out of business and 10 years from now it causes data loss and you didn't maintain those premiums, you could still be tracked down and sued. Not very likely but remotely possible. The theoretical answer is to continue paying for E&O forever, or license software only for specific time periods so you can safely shut down operations if needed.<p>Again, the chance of being sued is low. If you have insurance, they cover the cost of defending you in a lawsuit and also make you a less desirable target because it means there are insurance company lawyers defending against the claims, so chance of success in a lawsuit is smaller and can only be obtained at greater cost.<p>Most likely threat to you is really competitors coming after you with bogus patent claims, which can easily bankrupt you to fight against. Best way to avoid that is operate your business from a location that is difficult to bring legal actions in.",1283759927

It wasn't really that hard, and I didn't use anything tricky or uncomfortable, like starving myself beforehand. All you really have to do is climb into bed two hours before you went sleeping the previous night, and start reading.

When computers were first being developed for Japan, they used a half-width katakana font in order to fit in a smaller byte-size, and also be able to be displayed on small screens such as cash registers. This has carried over, and many appliances, printers, atms, etc still use the half-width katakana for display. It is truly a pain in the butt.<p>Sometimes all-katakana sentences are also used in books for when robots, aliens or foreigners are talking in order to give the speech a halting or ""non-japanese"" feel to it. I personally find it obnoxious, and like the Full Metal Alchemist way of dealing with it, where they only changed the last character of each line into katakana.<p>Katakana can also be used as english-speakers would use italics (or even all caps) in order to put stress on a certain word in a sentence.

The printing press narrowed the number of distinct styles somewhat, but even today if you look at handwriting across Europe, the capitals are pretty recognisable and would look familiar to an ancient Roman, but the rest of the text diverges a <i>lot</i>.<p>...which doesn't exactly answer your question of what it's ""for"", I guess.  But to some extent, we have two cases because that's what history gave us, and now we make use of them as best we can.",1283757376

Linguistically, they are separate languages, not dialects, though what you say is true (and it also holds for Spanish and Portuguese, for example). I don't speak Arabic, so I don't know how far the differences between say, Lebanese Arabic and Tunisian or Moroccan Arabic go. I do know that I've met people from Lebanon and Tunis, and they communicated in French between them, mostly. The explanation was basically that written Arabic was pretty much understandable by all Arabic speakers, but the dialects were too different in some cases.",1283757335

I just let my body sleep without limitations whenever I felt sleepy - no exceptions.<p>After about 3 to 4 days of doing this my sleep schedule settled on its own accord. On most days, I now sleep at around midnight and sometimes perhaps in the afternoon for a bit. Some days I don't sleep at all because I don't feel sleepy but that corrects in a few days to become normal again.<p>For me this is remarkable, I used to be an extreme example of a night owl.",1283757285

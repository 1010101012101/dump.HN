375880,comment,375296,375296,0,0,edb,,,"I did a radio show for two years, and all the recommendations on this page are a great way of finding music, but by no means are they better than just reading interviews and articles on your favourite artists, find out what makes them tick. Heck, go to a concert at your local (smaller) venue and chat with the band if you liked what they did.<p>That was always the best way I found music, lots and lots and lots of research and discussion with like minded people, mostly at shows.<p>... at least until www.last.fm came about. :) This, in my opinion, is the best way to find music that's in line with what you listen to. It takes what you listen to and finds people who listen to the same thing. It then finds out what they're listening to that you're not. Yes, you have to feed it your listening record, but once you've done that, your life won't be the same. I don't know why it's so neglected.<p>In fact, I always thought this would be the best way to run HN. Take all the articles I've upvoted, find people who've upvoted the same articles, look at what they've upvoted that I haven't and show me THAT on the main page.<p>The main problem with a HN for music is that music is too subjective and immeasurable. In hacking, you can argue stats, performance, visitors, etc. Music is different. More people listen to Brittany Spears than North of America, she also made more money, but there's no fully logical way to argue why she sucks. It's all a matter of perception and emotions. You can't wrap a webapp around that, nor can you get a group of people to agree on what's good and what's not because tastes vary so greatly.",1227580701

375877,comment,375617,375808,0,0,tannerburson,,,"Instapaper primarily targets the mobile market with it's main feature being the reformatting of pages for offline viewing.  (And damn is it a cool, and extremely well done feature.)<p>My focus is on making a lean, cross browser, bookmarking site with a focus on short-term storage.  If you don't opt-out of the feature you can get a reminder the day before any links expire in case you forget to read one.<p>This app grew out of the habit I had of emailing articles to myself several times a week so I could go back and read them after work, or at lunch, or whenever.  I realized there had to be a better way.  Looked at a few of the other sites around at that time, didn't really like any of them, so I wrote my own.<p>One of the big reasons I wrote my own was that I'm addicted to interfaces like Hacker News and Reddit.  Simple, concise, and almost exclusively text only.  I modeled the link-list on that idea.  The one twist being, thanks to some nifty JS code, that the longer a link hangs out on your list the more faded it becomes.  To me this makes it a much quicker and easier interface to get in, find what I need, and get out.  I carried the same idea through to the bookmarklet in that it doesn't redirect you to the MarkitForLater site when adding a link. Instead it adds it in the background and notifies you once it's done, this way you can continue reading, or move on with minimal interruption.<p>In summary, I think MarkitForLater provides a minimal impact on the way you browse, while still providing a useful service.<p>I think Instapaper is one hell of a cool application and has definitely earned it's place in the market.  I won't tell you which is better for you, but I know which one I use ;)",1227580495

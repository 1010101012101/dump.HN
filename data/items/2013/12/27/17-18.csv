It&#x27;s also why you see so many summer courses offered where for lack of time they cannot even hope to cover the material appropiately, and it&#x27;s why you see this proliferation of taught masters degrees.

Blocking RapGenius was a dick move, for years Google has told ppl complaining about ranking that you guys &quot;believe in the algorithm&quot; and refused human interference. RapGenius traded in some of the influence they have built by making a awesome product to boost a few of their search results, just like paying for SEO they payed for the bump they received via depreciating the value of their tweets and influence, if they continued to execute the same strategy on a reg basis their influence would quickly depreciate. Removing them just proves your lack of emotional intelligence and how influence works.

You&#x27;ve already gotten over the hard part, which is getting people to pay you as a freelancer. Double your rate. Double it again, maybe. You could be getting shitty work because you charge too little. Perhaps you&#x27;ll be happier if you charge more and get better projects. To add to that, you&#x27;ll have more time (because you&#x27;ll be doing less work, most likely) to build your skills and move on to something better.<p>5.

6971679,comment,6970777,6970777,6,0,listrophy,,,"Aerospace engineer here, weighing in...<p>I have two areas of expertise on this matter. First, I was on UW-Madison&#x27;s competition-winning FutureTruck team about 10 years ago. We were, IIRC, the only team of about 15 other universities that replaced our competition car&#x27;s (a Ford Excursion) entire frame with aluminum. In addition to replacing many other steel parts/assemblies with aluminum equivalents, we managed to bring the newly parallel hybrid SUV under stock weight... despite adding a large battery pack and motor. The thing I learned from this experience was: even though aluminum has about 1/3 the density of steel, your parts end up being about 50–55% of the steel weight because you need to add more aluminum to maintain equivalent strength. Basically, given the same tensile strength properties of a part, an aluminum one will be about half as heavy.<p>Second, I worked as a payload mechanical engineer for a number of spaceflight systems. Suffice to say, our base material for consideration was aluminum. Sure, we deferred to steel for certain applications (e.g., ball bearings, rat cage bars, fasteners, etc) and to myriad materials in others, aluminum was the standard. It has a tremendous strength/weight ratio, can be alloyed in many different ways to get different characteristics, is non-magnetic, is relatively cheap, and can have a number of interesting surface coatings applied. About the only major systemic problem aluminum has is that it is difficult to weld. Not impossible, as my FutureTruck experience tells me, but difficult. It didn&#x27;t matter to us, though, since NASA generally frowns upon welded joints anyway. Too much strength variation due to heat stress and potential for FOD if not ground properly.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve been waiting for the auto industry to catch up to a bunch of college students for 10 years now. Nice to see one of the Big Four finally getting it. And cheers to the smaller car companies that have been doing it for years.",1388166712

6971662,story,6970914,,1,0,nilkn,,,"I didn&#x27;t realize there were so many people on this forum who were disillusioned with technology. Honestly, I love my job as a software developer, and the <i>only</i> thing that bums me out is the cost of living in big cities. The best companies are almost exclusively in big cities. Although I have little passion for either the law or for medicine, I sometimes regret not going into those fields simply because I find myself not being able to afford a house without a horrid commute. I&#x27;d rather have a job I&#x27;m not passionate about which pays twice as much than a job I am passionate about but never be able to live in the area I want to live in.<p>As a guy who grew up in the midwest in a 2300 sq. ft. $120k home on a half acre of land, it&#x27;s hard for me to wrap my mind around real estate in cities. My parents are currently trying to sell said home at said price and can&#x27;t--the price is actually too high in the current market. Yet I hear tales of people paying cash 10% above asking price for seven-figure studio apartments in San Francisco.<p>It&#x27;s not just the Bay Area that&#x27;s expensive. Even in Houston, it&#x27;s common for a centrally-located home to push $1M in sticker price.<p>All I know is I&#x27;m not satisfied, financially, with where I&#x27;m currently at. I&#x27;m currently contemplating two paths: (1) going to Google, Facebook, etc., where the houses are even more expensive but the salaries are higher, saving up as much as I possibly can, and moving back to the midwest and semi-retiring in a simpler job; (2) seeking out remote work in a cheaper area without accepting a reduction in pay. (2) seems ideal to me, but it seems risky as well. I feel like remote workers are the first to get cut should layoffs be necessary, and finding another remote job wouldn&#x27;t be trivial.",1388166579

IT was no longer fulfilling, or was at least a headache, and I needed to do something different.<p>After film school, I needed money to pay for film school... so I tried to get back into IT.  San Francisco was still in the doldrums, so it was stressful trying to find a job and I kept fouling up interviews.  I eventually made my way down to LA and lucked into a good contract job there.  But I found myself really beating myself into the ground - development was taking so much out of me, I couldn&#x27;t manage to work on anything else, like screenplays...  I was going through burnout but couldn&#x27;t see it at the time.  The compulsion to do a good job was taking over and having a great client didn&#x27;t help.<p>Fast forward a decade to now, and I am getting completely out of IT now.  I&#x27;ve spent the last 4 years being professionally raped by a full blown sociopath and the reason I couldn&#x27;t see it was because I was having to put all my chi / focus / energy / whatever into doing the work - it was now a serious compulsion instead of the enjoyable &#x27;get paid for my hobby&#x27; thing my career started out as.  And being manipulated didn&#x27;t help...   This process I now see had started 10 years ago but I, like always, pushed myself to keep on the same track instead of forcing myself to go through the stress of change.  So I&#x27;ve lost a decade of my life here...<p>I may be projecting, but &quot;work, gym, sleep&quot; sounds like you are starting to do what I did.  Don&#x27;t!  It&#x27;s a slippery slope.  I wish to heck I&#x27;d reached out to HN like I see all these other people doing and asked for advice...  If you still like web development, great, keep up to date at least out of pure interest, but it does sound like you need to do something different, if only for awhile.  Changing gears will only help if you are getting habitual in your work life.<p>Pick something interesting in web development, just one or two things, and become an expert at it - at some point you&#x27;ll be able to get paid to do it no matter if you have a degree or not, just as long as you are prominent in some fashion in that particular ecosystem.  Being a generalist like me is only good if you like working for small companies and doing everything only &quot;good enough&quot; versus being the &quot;expert&quot; in one thing for a company.  Most companies only want square pegs they can hammer when they get past a certain size....<p>I&#x27;m guessing you are late 20s, early 30s?  It is about now then that people start asking themselves &quot;what do I want to really do when I&#x27;m 40ish?&quot;  I didn&#x27;t listen to myself unfortunately - procrastination.  So if so, you still have the time to make a mistake without too much consequence - one&#x27;s life is like the software design cycle (sort of).  If you think your life is like the waterfall model... every mistake in your 20s will haunt you forever (i.e. the women who have a checklist for Prince Charming).

Sometimes, it&#x27;s &quot;absolutely nothing&quot;. You have to learn how to judge that.<p>To engineers, missing deadlines sounds like this catastrophic error. This is amplified by our experience in an academic system where deadlines are well-tested and 95+ percent of students can meet them. The truth, however, is that most &quot;deadlines&quot; in business are flexible and more tied to some uninformed speculation on how long something &quot;should&quot; take, not how long it actually will take.<p>Some deadlines are hard. In law or government, 12:00 means 12:00 and 12:01 can mean missing a contract or losing a job. Governments are often legally forbidden (in the U.S.) from awarding a contract if the proposal comes in one minute after deadline (anti-corruption laws). Others (most, in software) only threaten mild embarrassment. Sometimes, you can tell ahead of time that the deadline will be missed no matter what happens and your job is to deflect blame.<p>If there&#x27;s a career benefit (as in a promotion, a raise, or some other hard currency that will advance your reputation) in working 70 hours per week to meet a deadline, then do it.

The OP is arguing that even non-shared mutable state should not be encapsulated away but should be accessible from some root data-structure. That way you can eg serialise the whole state of your program and restart it elsewhere or traverse the state with debugging and monitoring tools.<p>He points out that the traditional evils of global state (unrestrained mutation, non-reentrant code) have been solved in filesystems and databases and that those solutions could equally be applied to keeping state in-memory.<p>In other words, separate data from logic and keep all of your data in one place (whether that be a database, file-system or some well-controlled in-memory structure).",1388165846

In an emergency you are going to go to the closest available hospital.  As simple as that.<p>> nobody tells you which practitioner you can see in the UK where we have had socialised medicine for decades.<p>Well, that&#x27;s not how Obamacare works.  What&#x27;s the point of making the comparison of two approaches that are so different.<p>Let&#x27;s just look at cost.<p>How much would a healthy family of four pay for the NHS?  Is there a deductible?<p>Before Obamacare my family paid $600 per month with a $5,000 annual deductible.  We got great care and got to choose where to go and which doctors we see.  With Obamacare our monthly premium increases to $1,400 per month and our deductible to $10,000.  Also, our choices at nearly every level in the process of receiving care have become limited.  There are questions about which of the local hospitals we will, effectively, be &quot;assigned&quot; to by attrition and which doctors we might not be able to see.  The premium + deductible structure pretty much means that we stand to spend over $26,000 per year on medical care.  And, BTW, this isn&#x27;t a catastrophic plan.<p>With Obamacare the government is effectively, at a minimum, taking an extra $800 per month from us and in the worst case an extra $14,600.  And this is for worst care and choices than we had with our prior system.<p>Taking $15,000 a year from a family&#x27;s budget, when multiplied by potentially millions of families across the nation will have serious consequences.  That&#x27;s a lot of money that will not be available for purchasing.  That extra computer, uprgading the old car, intalling wood flooring in the house or taking a vacation simply will not happen.  And this will be the case with millions of families and individuals across the nation.<p>You see, you can call me whaever you want.  Extreme right wing libertarian moron.  That&#x27;s fine.  Shoot the messenger until you are happy.  Now let&#x27;s discuss facts and numbers and real world effects.

And you call others &#x27;sheep&#x27;!!<p>That is utterly false.  I have not brought up the military in his thread but I have in the past.  Our military spending is sickening.  Our wars are disgusting.  And a good deal of our foreign aid is simply wrong and ought to be discontinued.  Not only do I want our government to leave us alone, i want them to leave everyone else alone.<p>Our military spending has distorted our economy in ways that are hard to describe and probably even quantify.  This is why I love Obamacare as the example that pulled the curtains back to let everyone see how government really works.  Pick a number for how much was spent on the website.  It&#x27;s ridiculous.  And they are still spending untold millions to fix it.  Now imagine all military spending being equally bloated, wasteful and inefficient and ineffective.<p>Add it all up and it is easy to conclude that our government is causing us damage at every level and at a monumental scale.  And don&#x27;t get me started on patents.  Care to quantify how much damage just one government agency, the US Patent and Trademark Office, has done to our economy, industry and progress?<p>Call me a moron if you must.

However, there is aluminium and there is aluminium. I suspect that the new Ford truck has a bit more to it than the Land Rover (or even the Audi A2) has.<p>In the bike business there is 6 series aluminium and 7 series aluminium, to name the most popular alloys. The original aluminium frames were welded together tubes, for a while &#x27;bonding&#x27; was experimented with but that proved to be unreliable. The current state of the art is &#x27;hydroformed&#x27; aluminium, welded. The &#x27;hydroformed&#x27; frames are works of art, with the metal where you need it for strength, the grain structure also aligned for strength. The tubes are anything but plain cylinders and much more useful for design than was possible in the days of steel.<p>Does anyone have any more technical information on what the processes and alloys are going to be on this new-fangled truck?",1388164474

According to a documentary recently broadcast on Swedish television one of the reasons he was able to win that lawsuit was that someone in the US intelligence community (in a formal or informal capacity) helped him with background information on Hitachi&#x27;s expert witnesses. The motivation was said to be that US felt threatened by Japan in general, and IBM by Hitachi in particular.<p>There where many other accusations brought in the same documentary, some of which I&#x27;m sceptical about, but this particular one seemed plausible.

I hope more games keep coming to Ubuntu and Linux for Steam overall. I tried the Source SDK recently and the sample builds and runs successfully on Ubuntu. Now as far as game play, L4D2 and TF2 seem similar to me, too Hollywood, I like more muted game play, similar to L4D which I tried on Steam on Wine once. If that was on Linux now I&#x27;d buy that one and probably play it more. Also more Minecraft like games where when a grenade goes off you see damage to the walls, ground, etc. and you can build stuff, defenses, machines, etc. that would be unreal.",1388163848

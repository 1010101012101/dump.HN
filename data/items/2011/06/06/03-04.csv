I did not get the point!<p>However I have to admit that I find it difficult to totally deny the existence of patents when I think about it from a specific angle such as ""stackoverflow vs scrapers"". What if stackoverflow had filed for a patent years back!!<p>EDIT: oh yes I am aware that content protection is a copyright issue and has nothing to do with patent. And thats why I said ""thinking from a specific angle""; which means that it is not the exact analogy, it's just a picture how it might happen in the patent ground. And I am not trying to defend SW patents because they do not make sense, I am just bringing up the point that due credit should be given to original author and if he wants to patent it, it should be respected.",1307332643

On the service side, we are looking at better ways to architect websites for mobile clients, providing tools to help web developers maximize their performance, and automatic optimizations that can be performed by a site or in a proxy service. Finally, at the network layer we are looking at the (sometimes painful) interactions between different layers of the protocol stack and identifying ways to streamline them.""",1307332611

Gruber does have miserable blinders when it comes to pointing out how completely flawed some parts of the Apple experience are, and usually points out only those elements that literally 100% of the universe is in complete agreement on (Hello, Notifications).<p>I am the most idiotically brainwashed Apple Fan Boy around, ipads, MacBook Air, iPhone, watch all my TV on iTunes (though, 100% of my books are on the kindle) - and even _I_ can point out how miserable the iTunes experience is for media.  What, precisely, am I supposed to do with the last few years of TV Shows that I've purchased?  When it was in DVD format, I could simply pack them in folders, at 32GB/page in my binder - 1.5 Terabytes/binder.  Easy to lend, share, store - never lost a single file.  I have three of those binders now.<p>With iTunes, what happens when my stupid 128 GB Hard drive fills up?  What options did iTunes give me to managing / shifting TV Shows/Movies onto a NAS.  I have to do this godawful copy / move / delete dance to manage my media, and, should that NAS crap out - everything is lost.<p>iTunes has been a _horrible_ long term media management experience for me, and adding the ""cloud"" feature, in the same way Amazon has done for books on the kindle (and, now that I think of it, Music on their storage locker) - is just bringing them up to the status Quo - it's a case of _stopping the pain_ - not really ""game changing""<p>So - yes, please add the Damn ""Cloud"" already, so I can win back some of my life that I've dedicated to being a .mp4 data sysadmin.<p>PS: You want Game Changer?

Your example proves nothing.<p>I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying you didn't demonstrate proof, so you shouldn't act like you did.<p>I'm extremely interested why bcrypt is much more secure than SHA1 + extremely long hash, so perhaps you could shed some photons on that?<p>Also, in order for bcrypt to generate a unique salt on two different computers, it needs a unique source of randomness. Obviously seeding by ""current time"" is insufficient, as this would generate the same salt for two different computers at the same time. So what does it use? Mac address of network card + current time?",1307331067
2623577,comment,2622166,2622683,3,0,colanderman,,,"> Is the module functor compiled only once, or once for every parameter type?<p>Only once.  It does in fact miss optimization opportunities in OCaml (where ints and float arrays are given special treatment).  In theory this can be overcome with whole-program optimization. The MLton compiler for SML (which also has functors) is such a compiler, though I do not know how it handles this particular case (I would presume it does).<p>I know of no other languages that allow type modularity beyond the ML family (including various derived formal logic systems).  Racket (PLT Scheme) provides ""units"" which are a similar idea to functors but use contracts instead of types (since Racket is currently untyped).  The analogue of a type in Racket is a type membership function from any value to boolean; this function can be used elsewhere in the unit.  See for example: <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Signatures_and_Units.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Signatures_and_Units.html</a>",1307331032

2623569,story,,,9,3,argarg,"Ask HN: How could I make things change in my crappy CS department.",,"Hey HN,<p>I'll be finishing college in a week. I attended what we call here in Quebec, Canada a ""Cgep"", which is between high school and university. It's a 3 year program in computer science. Unfortunately, it's overally worse than your worst nightmares. Now that I'm about to finish, I feel very bad for any future students of this program, and I want to save their lives.<p>My teachers have absolutely no interest in ""staying up to date"", and they've all been teaching there for over 10 years. So they will either teach this very outdated stuff, or pretend they know something new and give us links to look for. I don't need those links, my Google skills are much better than theirs, and so is my interest for newer technologies. I love programming and I'm lucky I'm one of the 4 students (out of 34) who will finish without failing a class, although I've been highly unmotivated all the way.<p>Just to give you an idea of how bad it is, exactly 1/5 of the 3 years there were spent on learning Oracle Forms Builder 6i. If you don't know what it is, here is a link to a sample web app built with this: http://technology.amis.nl/blog/wp-content/images/jhsmig0.jpg . It is deprecated, will only run on windows XP or lower, keeps crashing, and is not similar to anything you can think of.<p>Enough ranting, my goal is to do what has already been attempted before, make things change. I plan on writing a letter to the school direction, backed by many other students, bringing many of the problems and solutions. Some other students have already made this attempt without success. I also plan on writing an open letter in the local newspaper to talk about the subject. The thing is it's difficult for me to explain what is wrong without giving any technical details, which would not be understood or taken too lightly. The whole department, every teacher, is problematic. So there is no one else to understand the technicality behind all this.<p>I don't want to fail like others have and I want to do something which will bring real changes. It cannot continue like this, I've seen too many students fail where they shouldn't have and lose faith in their future in this field because of this. What else can I do and how should I do it? I'm looking for any advice.<p>Thanks you",1307330736

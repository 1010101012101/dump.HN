They didn't install security updates because ""they break some of our in-house apps"". For security reasons the system was isolated from the internet, hence the on-site debugging. The bug they had was fixed in sp2, which is why it didn't appear in our test environment. They did have an upgrade planned ... to IE8. So, yes, jealous is the sentiment for me.<p>On the other hand, I've not come across anything that's in modern browsers that I couldn't get to work on IE6, with appropriate (sometimes flash-based) fallbacks.

I have no idea how I should start - there's no defined structure and I'm not entirely sure what the best way to get value from it would be (e.g. what should my lists be called, when should I create a new list versus use an old list).<p>It's very similar to Google Wave - in that it presents a bunch of tools to use but no indication on the best way to use them.

We take our responsibilities  and the trust you place in us  very seriously. I cannot express how sorry I am to those of you who were inconvenienced.<p>The service outage was due to a series of internal network events that corrupted router data tables. Once the issues were identified, we took corrective actions to restore services for our customers and GoDaddy.com. We have implemented a series of immediate measures to fix the problem.<p>At no time was any sensitive customer information, including credit card data, passwords or names and addresses, compromised.<p>Throughout our history, we have provided 99.999% uptime in our DNS infrastructure. This is the level of performance we expect from ourselves. Monday, we fell short of these expectations. We have learned from this event and will use it to drive improvement in our services.<p>As a result of this disruption, your account will be credited for the value of 1-month of service for each of your active/published sites.* This credit will be available to you for the next 7 days.

But their presence is not because of religion but because they are illegal refugees/immigrants from Bangladesh who are encroaching and settling in the traditional lands of the indigenous tribes and Indians who live in those areas.<p>But this is a situation that has been building up for years, and has at its core a socio-economic cause and the religious  coherence of the encroachers is a secondary thing.<p>I could go on about how the Mumbai riots and later the exodus but that is a separate point.<p>Secondly - Saying that Sonia Gandhi ""has effectively injected massive corruption in India's state bureaucracy"" is to take the latest head of state and blame her for the creation of a beast that reared its head first in the time of Indira Gandhi in the 1960s (License Raj)<p>Saying that it is a mafia driven monarchy further simplifies the situation and ignores the effects of the many corrupt parties and their respective leaders in the coalition government.<p>If anything India was MORE corrupt in the 1990s just prior to the reforms and a short while after.<p>It was only with the dismantling of power centers and places for the corrupt to seek rents that a lot of the old guard found themselves shunted out.<p>If anything I would hold Sonia and Congress responsible for being gutless and focusing on consolidating their power base.<p>But most of all I would single out the swing coalition partners from Bengal above all.<p>The Communist party that supported the Govt in the first few  years constantly and consistently stymied each and every forward thinking disinvestment and reform oriented bill.<p>Then came Mamta Bannerjee and her equally if not more anachronistic ideas. IIRC she managed to get rid of the TATA Nano plant which would have created large amounts of employment in her home state.

Musk is an engineer, and from what I've seen of him, he seems like less of a bullshitter than the average businessperson. Combined with his consistent delivery of results, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.<p>As for launch windows, the energy required is at a minimum every 26 months, and there's a global min twice every ~17 years, the next two being in 12 and 14 years, so you'd have the easiest time then. [1] If they have a non-marginal plan, then maybe one of the relative minima would be sufficient.<p>What makes you say that action is absent? My impression is that SpaceX has actually been tackling a very aggressive timetable in general. I believe they're working on the Falcon Heavy and crew modules right now and they're proposing a launch for a Dragon capsule to Mars in 2018.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars</a>",1347696030

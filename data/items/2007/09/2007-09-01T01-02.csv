49111,comment,48752,49108,0,0,rms,,,"Equatorial Guinea is the perfect target for takeover. It has the second highest GDP per capita PPP adjusted in the world, yet the average citizen lives on less than a dollar a day because the evil dictator takes all the oil money. It's waiting to fall. Margaret Thatcher's son tried to stage a coup in 2005 and failed. MI6 and the CIA knew about the attempt and provided anecdotal support, they want Equatorial Guinea to have a new, western friendly leader.<p>Basically, Thatcher just didn't spend enough money. A billion in private defense contractors (mercenaries) would be plenty to take Equatorial Guinea with overwhelming force. The defenders might not even fire a shot.",1188611728

I'd probably choose mostly hacker-founders like Larry & Sergey, Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, and so on.  Steve Jobs.  Maybe Bill Gates.

49106,comment,48770,49087,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Any software project, no matter how cool it seems, is at least 50% drudge work. I'd be willing to argue that the inverse-pseudo-pareto-principle applies... 20% of any non-trivial software project is fun, and the other 80% is drudge work.<p>Even certain open source projects require paid staff. The only reason FireFox exists is because the Mozilla foundation can pay programmers to work on the ugly parts. ",1188611368

If you're pissing people off, you're probably doing something right.<p>The funny part is, for most people here, Aaron and Matt aren't reading <i>your</i> blog -- but you're reading theirs!  This is like a Denial-Of-Service attack against their competition by inducing them to waste time they could be spending on their own startup instead reading about someone else's.  <p>Id software was a master at this.  Everyone was so busy playing Quake, Quake II, etc. that they weren't working on their own games.  Did you know actual celebrities are horrible at recognizing other celebrities?  They are too busy making movies to read celebrity gossip magazines.<p>Speaking of, I probably should get back to work!",1188610469

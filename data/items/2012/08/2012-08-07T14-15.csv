That's one of the great things about having reasonably anonymous message boards--there exists the very good opportunity to perform communication without the overhead associated with being polite, reasonable, or even civilized.<p>On Hacker News, I expect that my posts will (for better or worse) someday come back to haunt me. Indeed, if you apply to YC, I believe one of the application questions asks for your HN username. This being the case, there are certain arguments and jokes that I have had to refrain from making. I've even had to apologize OOB every so often to people here for being hot-headed (I believe I once said some nasty things to one of the senior Apache folks...awkward).<p>On 4chan, these ""vile posts"" are honest expressions of either the poster or of the facade the poster wishes to maintain--and in a completely anonymous setting, it's easier not to pose at all. An interesting research question would be to compare the normal posters to the non-anonymous ""tripfags"" and ""namefags"" (users who post under the same username and signature--terminology is as found on the chan), but I honestly have no idea how that might be done in any useful sense.<p>The entire mindset of interacting with complete strangers, and especially knowing that you may well never share a thread with them again, is hugely liberating. You can make and laugh at jokes that otherwise would be in poor taste. You can discuss trivial things very seriously, and serious things very lightly, and be assured that you won't be tagged/branded permanently as a fool or a fetishist--consider what we've done to losethos here, and how at this point even if he started posting coherently he'd still downvoted into oblivion.<p><pre><code>  ""Are you implying that I'm only truly me when I'm vile 
  (for example)?""
</code></pre>
As explained above, I imagine that the proper insinuation here is that you're only truly you (publicly) when you have no incentive to put on a ruse/pleasantries--and that if you do so anyways, that is part of the true self.<p>My experience, for example, is that I am just as much the humble helpful hacker given debugging help and useful links on the /pr/ programming board as I am the mean-spirited hateful troll on /adv/--and on any given day, I may do the opposite. Seeing my behavior when held to no external standard has been enlightening, and proven to be a useful data point in self-discovery and self-betterment. I try to help more and troll less now. :)",1344350565

I could go on and on about the charge-by-the-day option, and how everyone wins with it: clients don't worry about whether having a conversation with me will be charged - <i>of course it won't!</i> - and it gives me the freedom to create huge amounts of client satisfaction if I do a ten-minute fix for free.<p>So, charge good rates, in daily increments, and do so happy in the knowledge that you're charging a fair rate for valuable skills.",1344349275

You can't copy and paste them  and you have to have a computer nearby to do it (it's very hard to use the Google password-generator page on mobile)<p>Here is the list of the application-specific passwords that have to be individually entered (10+ characters each):<p><i>On my mobile</i><p>- iphone mail<p>- iPhone Google account (through browser)<p>- iphone work mail<p>- iPhone (work Google account through browser)<p>- iphone calendar<p>- iPhone calendar (work)<p><i>DUPLICATE ALL OF THE ABOVE FOR iPad</i><p><i>DUPLICATE ALL OF THE ABOVE FOR MacBook Air</i><p>Switch on 2-factor auth and you immeidately find all these apps go dead until you do this. It will take you about 15m at least to do this and you'll  have to do it again if you change your password or get a new device. You can't copy and paste because the Google auth-token page is unusable on moble.<p><i>What we need is easy, incremental security improvement</i><p>The problem with Google 2-factor auth is that it was designed by security geeks. It takes 3m just to watch their setup video! The system needs to be designed by usability geeks and audited by security geeks.<p>2-factor auth is no use at all if it's switched off. Contrast my switched off 2-factor auth with my Facebook auth which texts me every time someone logs in from a new machine and you contrast a system which provides me with a bit more security (FB) and one which pertains to be secure (Google) but which adds nothing.<p>Google needs to rip the security guys out of their security team and put the user experience people in.  End-user security is a UX problem and Google is in a powerful position to effect change.<p>[Edited above for (a little) brevity]<p>EDIT BELOW: for folks who feel this account is unfair:<p>I realise that if you keep a PGP encrypted file on another device that is necessary to do your password reset then yes, Google 2-factor auth is very strong indeed.<p>I also realise that you shouldn't tell someone your password. The point is though that resetting your password is something that only really needs your phone. The key elements to resetting your password usually involve sending a password or an out-of-channel token to another acccount. For most people that other account is their work mail or Facebook, both of which are usually accessible via their phone.<p>I'm not talking about the absolute strength of Google 2-factor authentication. I'm talking about how that type of process applies to the type of internet user who tries to log into Facebook through ReadWriteWeb:<p><a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_yo...</a>",1344349122

I don't keep confidential information in my e-mail. And I don't register all of my various accounts at sites around the web to just one e-mail address. If someone got access to one of my e-mail accounts it would probably be a general-use one, and quite honestly it wouldn't affect me much.<p>It's also annoying to have to verify every time I log in. I probably log in more often than most people. When my browser session ends, all my cookies, cache and history are erased (not because i'm paranoid, but to help guard against CookieMonster, history probing and similar attacks on sites that don't do secure browsing right). Even though it may only be occasionally, having to go find my phone to authenticate the login takes away from my browsing experience, and I don't find the tradeoff worth the hassle.<p>It doesn't help that Google's authenticator medium is SMS. As a hacker, I find there's way too many avenues to intercept the token (not the least of which is an already-logged-in Google Voice session!). I like the idea of using a YubiKey, but if I have to stick the device into my computer, it's annoying. I prefer plain-old tokens like RSA's SecurID or the PayPal token (I got mine when it was still only $5). But it's not automatic. I have to do a bunch of work to set it up, and i'm lazy.<p>At the end of the day, even once you set up two factor, a good attacker will <i>still</i> get past it if they really want to. Separation of accounts will go a lot farther towards keeping your digital self safe than putting all your eggs into a two-factor single-account Google basket.<p>Edit: This post has encouraged me to pay the $20 for Bank of America's SafePass Card, which I consider to be much more secure than an app or sms.",1344348771

If your algorithm is not based on a space decomposition structure, it won't linearly parallelize across a vast number of cores. When I say some algorithm won't distribute or parallelize, this is what I am usually (but not always) looking at.<p>Space decomposition structures take a metric space and decompose it using an invariant space partitioning function. The partition points are fixed regardless of data distribution, the only decision process is when to apply the partitioning function.<p>The two well-known examples in literature are quad-trees and distributed hash tables. These are both very simple, narrow examples of space decomposition structures in a universe of possible metric spaces and possible partitioning functions. Many parallel data problems can't be made to fit into the simple space decomposition structures computer scientists are familiar with.<p>When massively parallel machinery is the foundational assumption, every computational structure must be represented in terms of space decomposition primitives. Right now, most computer scientists treat space decomposition structures as dumb data buckets and are largely oblivious to their expressiveness. Most published parallel algorithm computer science is based on computational structures that will only sort of parallelize on sufficiently small systems.",1344348731

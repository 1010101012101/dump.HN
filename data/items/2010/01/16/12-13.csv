1056861,comment,1054989,1056168,0,0,billswift,,,">Your uncle now has the much easier job of cleaning out the meters, rather than running around all day. And maybe someone gets a skilled-labor job as a parking meter repairman?<p>But there are <i>fewer</i> jobs available in this situation in aggregate.  This is a problem with several criticisms of automation that I have seen in liberal and libertarian circles - they claim that automation does not decrease the number of workers since workers are needed to deal with the automation.  Apparently they are totally innumerate, since while new jobs are created servicing the automation, the total number of jobs is significantly reduced.",1263646423

I think it gets my behavior misinterpreted.  And I have had people say horribly insensitive things in front of me about how forty is just around the corner for them and ""how scary is that?!"" and similar.  (Someone who knew my age, which is why I feel it is insensitive.  And it was a pattern of behavior over a period of months, not a stray remark.  Still, I suspect this person just doesn't really think of me as ""over 40"", even though they know I am, and I think that is part of why they blathered on thoughtlessly in front of me about their negative feelings about their own age.)<p>I'm still trying to figure out what causes people to perceive me as younger than I am.  I find it baffling.  But it has happened on the Internet too.  So I suspect it is in part behavior-related, not just a looks thing.",1263646176

It's like the English ""legalese"", but with no relation to lawyers specifically.<p>You talking about ""Канцелярит"" (kantceliaryt?). ""Канцелярия"" means ""office"". Suffix ""ит"" here means language or disease. So ""канцелярит"" means ""official language/disease"".

1056847,comment,1055276,1055340,0,0,Mz,,,"I struggle with this question when I write.  On the one hand, I sometimes feel like I am ""repeating myself but with rephrasing"".  On the other hand, I find that those instances of rephrasing adds content.  I often get accused of being excessively long-winded, yet when I shorten things too much, I get wildly misunderstood.<p>I find that many people don't have the context.  I suspect part of it is that I don't see the world the same way most people see it.  Shorter remarks rely on shared context to be properly understood.  Example:  In my teens, I remarked to my father that I was considering ""running"" (something).  I was a role playing gamer considering taking up gamemastering.  He assumed I meant jogging for exercise.  I didn't bother to try to correct.  It seemed futile.",1263644699

One thing I did was to try to find the best dose of caffeine for me.  I tried regular coffee, decaff, and coffee and caffeine pills; several times and in different orders.  With as close to controlled conditions as one person alone could arrange, I discovered that caffeine has <i>absolutely no effect</i> on me.  I could discern absolutely no difference in alertness, learning (read a textbook chapter and did test at end), or reaction time (simple video game).  I already knew I didn't react strongly to caffeine, hence the experimenting, but the result was a surprise.  Apparently all of the effects I had previously attributed to caffeine had been placebo.",1263643977

1056838,comment,1056435,1056591,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"It's kind of like giving a free demo, really. It's the same principle. You give someone a taste but limit the experience and allow them to unlock everything for a fee.<p>The difference here is that the fees are small and many, whereas in the old days it was just a one-time drop of $49.99, or whatever.<p>This model adapts better to an online, social context because it seems less restrictive, allows participation by everyone, and you can choose how much you want to spend on the experience, and how much of the experience is worth unlocking, and what parts to unlock at what times.<p>I think that it works well for systems like phone apps, where users just want to try something out before dropping much cash on it.",1263643709

Then all you would need to send to Mars every time a crew would have to go there would be the lander and supplies for the ISS to keep the crew alive and well for the 150 days or so of the transfer (and pack some supplies for the transfer back). That would significantly reduce the mass you have to send every trip. Having a capable platform on a permanent transfer orbit would also be great for science. Much better than LEO.<p>You would, of course, have to send repair and expansion parts, some extra propellant for trajectory corrections, replacements for damaged modules and build a whole lot more redundancy into the ISS than it has now - remember it would not be possible to use the Soyuz lifeboats on an emergency - not even when crossing Earth orbit as the ISS would be going too fast for the Soyuz to properly aerobrake.<p>It doesn't solve all the problems and is not what the journalist proposed, but it is close enough - the ISS would go to Mars and back (and to Mars and back and so on for as long as it could be repaired).<p>I would go for it.<p>But the upgrades wouldn't be cheap.",1263643289

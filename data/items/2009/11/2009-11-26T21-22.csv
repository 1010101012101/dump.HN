I like how the right column is used as a per page FAQ.<p>A few minor suggestions:<p>- Consider merging or ditching one of the two taglines.  The site becomes easier to read if the eye doesn't have to jump around.<p>- When a user is not signed in, there are 3 buttons in the nav bar which lead to twitter login.  It may be a good idea to remove them or add example content for guests.<p>- The ""Get Started"" link is really a ""Log in"" link.  This could be confusing.<p>All in all, great work!

The way the game world evolves naturally it's fascinating for all sorts of reasons, and I love open-ended gameplay.<p>I played A Tale in the Desert for some time.<p>But this time of gameplay is hard for people to get into.  It demands a lot from the player.  You might call it ""active"" gameplay.<p>WoW is the opposite.  The story is crafted for you, not by you, and it is more about pure gameplay than these higher-order things in EVE.  It's a much more passive experience.<p>I don't think it should surprise anyone that EVE is less profitable.  It is, by it's nature, less inclusive.<p>EVE is your favorite indie band.  WoW is the latest pop hit.<p>Also, I wouldn't discount the amount of time Blizzard puts into crafting the in-game experience of WoW.  It's very polished and very fun, even if on some level it's less fulfilling than the do-it-yourself nature of EVE.<p>The upcoming Cataclysm expansion is just one example of the kind of thing that can happen in WoW, but could never happen in EVE.",1259271293

Maybe the developer leaves, maybe the mainstream development organization changes some other system it relies on, maybe the auditors show up and the security guys lock down the firewalls and stuff running on a PC under someone's desk no longer has access. Hell, maybe that PC's hardware fails for some reason, maybe someone makes a mistake and said developer didn't use the central, backed-up version control.<p>Then the users come to IS and piss and whine but get nothing but blank stares in return. And you know, stuff IS does takes time, because we build it to be supportable for the next decade or two (yes really). We write a runbook so someone who's never seen it before can recover it if it fails at 3am, and we make sure it's monitored. We get it signed off by compliance for regulatory oversight. We penetration test it. We back it up offsite and replicate it to the DR site. We stick a generator behind it and we know how many Watts of power it needs (we even know what it weighs so we don't overload the floor in the datacentre).

No, they go to the WSJ directly to find out what the WSJ says.  I bet it's more likely that wanting to know what someone specific says isn't often a use case of searching for news.<p>That being said, I do use Google to find Wikipedia articles just because Google's search is so much stronger than Wikipedia's at honing in on the entry I want.<p>Sure, while people do use searching to find websites, people actually need to use a browser that defaults to bing or have changed their default search engine to bing, or need to change their habits to use bing to do search.  Is Microsoft's browser monopoly still strong enough to allow them to influence the default search engine use?<p>One way this could play out is that, if people use ""news search"" to see what _anyone_ has said, rather than what a specific source says, then the fraction of sources that are listed only with bing (or not with google) are not going to be part of the discussion.",1259269565

So if you decide that no vernacular can embody mistakes, you're bound to conclude that nothing any individual does can be a mistake, so long as they do it consistently.</i><p>But lots of disciplines involving living things have problems like this.  You can't ""define"" species.  A species is a historical happenstance, which can only be precisely defined in retrospect with minute information we usually never have access to.  You can spend all day coming up with corner cases and boundary conditions where any such attempt breaks down.  But that's like deciding if a particular boulder in Panama is a North American one or a South American one.  Just because those terms break down in boundary cases and are not like mathematics doesn't mean those terms aren't useful.<p>Things pertaining to human beings and culture are even more prone to this.<p>In the case of African American vernacular, there are sizable populations with high degrees of consistency in their patterns of speech.  Quite far away from boundary conditions.<p>Another thing I've noted, since dating an African American woman and attending family gatherings with her, is that the manners and rules of social conduct of rural African Americans are more complex than I am accustomed to.  When I am with her family, I have to <i>think</i> about how I'm going to excuse myself and navigate leaving a room.  Otherwise, I never think about this.  I reflected on this, and realized that it reminded me of watching Masterpiece Theater as a child.

Mozilla explicitly refusing to support both H264 and Theora (because they want to make a stand) is like OpenOffice refusing to read both doc and odt, because doc is proprietary format.<p>I would prefer to see open, unpatented and free video codec used for the majority of web video. I applaud Mozilla for taking a stance. I don't applaud them taking a stance by limiting their users' freedom, instead of directly talking to Google, Vimeo and others and lobbying for the use of more open formats. Surely, a letter from Mozilla ""hey guys, we really think you should support Theora too, let's meet and we'll tell you why we think it's very important"" would have more effect than random blog articles & what amounts to blackmail?",1264409972

1074726,comment,1074002,1074002,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think Internet censorship is great, because it pushes technologies like Bittorrent and Tor into the mainstream, which improves those technologies.  Every time someone uses one of those tools to do something silly like download a song or look at pictures of 17-year-old-girls, we are getting closer and closer to an Internet that the governments can't meddle with.  When information can flow freely without consequence from the organizations in power, society can advance.  Imagine how much more useful information will end up on Wikileaks when the leaker can truly be anonymous and safe from the established power structure their action is hurting.  It will be very good for society as a whole.  (And there is the whole issue of ""Tor is just for child pornographers"".  When you have to use it to see the New York Times, nobody will think that anymore.)<p>Anyway, Internet censorship is just something that looks good in the headlines, but it is not a real issue.  These technical measures are easy to get around, and will keep getting easier. (When I was in China, I just ssh'd to my home machine to browse websites that the Great Firewall blocked.  Oh yeah, damn the global nature of the Internet...)",1264409450

It must be terrible to see other people that seem lazy to overwork you.<p>In my experience, the best workers I'd known were lazy bastards, from that reaper that worked only in the morning because grass was fresh(dew) and did more in one hour that all we in the entire day to the CNC machine programmer nobody knew how he made simple programs in very short time and leave that surpassed our own in the company.<p>His ""having it big is good"" argument is flawed too, I have a friend with an enormous one that had real problems with girls.",1264409046

That content would go uncreated, and that we'd somehow lose out on content that <i>needs to be incentived</i> in order to be created, and that said content is somehow more valuable than content that doesn't need an incentive to be created, seems like a pretty big assumption.",1264408912

1074718,comment,1074285,1074387,0,0,rms,,,"Piracy is not a market correction. It is a <i>superior product</i>. What.cd and waffles.fm, with their depth of product and usability, make iTunes and Amazon music seem like a joke.<p>The music hydra does not just have every album, it has most versions of every album. When what.cd and waffles.fm are shut down, they will be replaced by four sites, possibly more.<p>For example, for The Beatles album <i>Let It Be</i>, the following editions are available, as high-quality MP3s and FLAC (currently just FLAC for the vinyl rips, which is fine):<p>24 bit lossless vinyl rip of the 1970 Apple record. 24 bit lossless rip of 1982 Japanese vinyl. 1987 Parlophone CD. 2004 Apple vinyl rip (16 bit lossless, alas). 2007 Purple Chick Remaster. 2007 Dr. Ebbetts Remaster. 2008 Dr. Ebbetts Remaster. 2009 Apple Remaster.<p>When the music industry can offer a product superior to piracy, they will stand a chance. When the marginal cost of production falls to zero, classical economics ceases to function and extra-market restrictions are needed to force the continued existence of the market.",1264408725

An example:<p><i>Despite there being diminishing returns on my time beyond a certain point, there are still positive returns. To elaborate, if my first 10 working hours per day are worth $10 per hour to the investors, the 11th hour may be worth $9, the 12th hour $8 and so on. Still my 19th working hour would still be worth $1 to the investors. As long as I am not destructive and my work produces value, and I can function the next day back at the $10 an hour mark, there are real benefits to my company for me putting in my time.</i><p>He provides no proof for his claim that performance drops off in such a linear fashion and he can consistently work nineteen hour days while being just as productive the next day.",1264407832

Concepts in suitable areas that would take several lines to represent in another language might take only a line or two in Haskell.<p>On the other hand, there are other areas where Haskell takes pretty much the same amount of lines as an imperative language, and still others where Haskell's model isn't such a good match and it might require more lines.",1269751992

1224210,comment,1224071,1224139,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> The question becomes: when does hiding complexity improve your ability to reason about the code?<p>How about this: ""when the degree of complexity hidden is greater than the extra complexity introduced by the abstraction mechanism""?<p>Edit: Here's an example to show what I mean. Suppose we have a 2D array representing a matrix of values and we want to print it. We could write an algorithm like this:<p><pre><code>  function print_matrix =\n    for each row i\n      for each column j\n        print_element i j\n</code></pre>\nOr we could write something like this:<p><pre><code>  function print_matrix =\n    for each row i\n      print_row i\n\n  function print_row i =\n    for each column j\n      print_element i j\n</code></pre>\nIn the second version, we might have shorter functions and less nesting, but we haven't significantly lowered the level of abstraction between one function and the other, so there is little real benefit. On the other hand, we have reduced the cohesion because now the reader must follow the logic through two functions instead of one, and this is bad. There is too much extra complexity created by introducing the second function and not enough hidden complexity because the levels of abstraction aren't much different, so breaking out the inner loop is a bad trade-off that makes it harder to reason about the code.",1269750395

1224206,comment,1224071,1224071,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"We are far too willing to dismiss things as mere ""personal preference"" in this industry. There may be competing theories all supported by some empirical evidence and sound logic, but some claims are directly contradicted by hard data. Those claims are not just a personal preference for the best way to do things. They are measurably, objectively wrong, and failing to say so is just being nice because we don't want to criticise someone.<p>On the evidence I have found to date, I am coming around to the view that the style of writing many very short functions (say up to 5-6 lines) with little complexity in the logic (say just a single level of nesting) is one approach whose claimed superiority is directly contradicted by empirical data. For example, McConnell discussed the number-of-lines issue in <i>Code Complete</i> years ago, citing multiple studies. Anyone can find still more by investing a few minutes in Google Scholar searches.<p>Alas, that does not stop bloggers, consultants, trainers and book authors from advocating this programming style, even though it invariably results in the kind of incohesive ""spread"" that the article mentioned.",1269750104

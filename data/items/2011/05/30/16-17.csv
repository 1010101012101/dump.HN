And (2) because of <i>positive bias</i> we test cases we expect to go well.<p>For example, in the Tornado web stack, its certainly possible to gracefully handle an exception you threw in the middle of responding to a method, but you have to basically augment the framework to do so.

2599832,comment,2599125,2599125,1,0,todayiamme,,,"There's a selection bias in operation over here.<p>The real question is what type of workers do they actually attract? I am desperate and out looking for a job and for me all of these freelancing sites are a last resort.<p>Why?<p>First of all, there are arbitrary restrictions placed upon the workers (and I'm guessing they're present for the companies as well) limiting in some cases not just the amount of bids, but how I can bid, how much I can bid, what I can write and what I can't, my profile picture and what not. A lot of it is understandable as fraud detection, but what really gets to me is the environment.<p>The problem with bidding in such an environment is that workers are chosen on the basis of cost. Yes, they put stars next to each worker's name and recommendations from previous employers are there, but do you really think that anyone looks through all of that?<p>No.<p>I think that there's a heavy selection bias on the side of the employers as well. People who emphasise on quality wouldn't go to such outsourcing sites for critical things like their code or their copy they'll either ask around in their network. Or, if push comes to shove they'd rather do such things themselves than risk botching it up.<p>So, the users of this site are people who're trying to save a buck while getting and aiming for average quality, at  best. Hence, there is a focus of bidding on cost instead of quality.<p>Further, since we bid on the basis of cost people as the number of workers increases the average bid decreases. This means that I will have to squeeze in more work to make the same amount of money. This means that the quality of my performance per job will automatically decrease leading to greater pain all around.<p>So, what happens is an avalanche. The best workers, who are trying to improve their craft, will intend to compete on the basis of quality. Whereas the implicit selection pressure will be on the basis of cost. So, either they reduce the quality per job (and increase the number of jobs) or they bide their time and open the doors to greener pastures and thus leave. As the site will grow this will happen again and again until you reach the lowest common denominator and that's their problem.<p>Plus, add to the fact that my margins will be heavily dictated by them I've safely labelled this as a last resort.",1306774607

They are ugly, inefficient, and apparently a huge danger for the birds. I really cannot see how that is environmentally friendly.<p>AFAIK, nuclear fuel cannot be produced, it can only be distilled. So, we're only using whatever radioactive materials exist on Earth anyhow. Were they mined from deep underground? Let's bury the waste deep underground, and there should be no problem.<p>I see three long-term solutions. 1) Use nuclear energy in a safe and responsible way. 2) wait until solar panels are developed enough and use them. However, both these solutions still have a big problem: batteries suck (they are heavy, inefficient, expensive and toxic, short-lived). Final solution: 3) grow genetically modified algae and use them to produce bio-diesel. The only problem would be the  concentration of CO2 and other exhaust gasses in urban areas.",1306774467

2599821,comment,2599652,2599787,10,0,alexqgb,,,"It's also important to remember who you're presenting to. If they're people who really understand the process, the constraints, and - most importantly - where they want the project to go, then the feedback is likely to be excellent. Indeed, the resulting conversations (and ideally, that's exactly what they are) can be some of the most creatively inspired bits of the process. Also, very productive, in that they are likely to focus on the removal of obstacles.<p>On the other hand, if you're presenting to people who really don't have a sense of the big picture (and who are often insecure about their position and judgement), you tend to anticipate their tendency to (a) fixate on small, rough bits and (b) issue VERY specific instructions about those elements (often, while ignoring the rest). This is the exact mechanism by which incompetent managers paralyze creative talent, reducing any project to a derivative effort that hews as close as legally possible to ""whatever worked before."" In this case, management IS the obstacle, and good luck getting them to remove themselves.<p>In these situations, you're no longer focused on the work. You're thinking about dodging bullets and managing up, hoping to find the best 'compromise' between a great creative solution, and the need to placate the fragile egos of people who probably don't belong in their jobs. The awesome thing about Pixar is that they really seem to get this, and invest considerably resources in creating and staffing the kind of environment where people CAN iterate freely.",1306774382

So you might have:<p><pre><code>    { \n      entity_type: 'Book',\n      entity_fields: [ \n        { \n          field_type: int,\n          field_name: 'title',\n          required: true\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis would be a proto definition called, ""Entity"". From here you could build procedure calls that send entities for doing common routines, such as updates, or deletes. If you can make a structure like this work, you can build an api with javascript which hides the protobufs from you all together.. When you call Model.get('Book').create({title: 'My book'}), it constructs the Entity protobuf and calls the remote call for creating a new entity.<p>Just an idea! Also - protorpc is in fresh development, so it's a good idea to join the discussion group and make suggestions: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-protorpc-discuss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-protorpc-disc...</a>",1306773472

I'm not no expert on bitcoin, but this is a somewhat stream of consciousness on the area that most concerns me.<p>Bitcoin could suffer an implementation derived security attack, ruining all practical value.  The math behind bitcoin may be rock solid.  However the implementations of clients on p2p network are vulnerable to security attack.  If bitcoin begins to transition to mainstream and something like SQL Slammer hits it, a rival crypto currency, or a big company derived alternative will replace it, assuming crypto-currency as a whole doesn't garner a three-mile island like reputation.<p>In its current state Bitcoin could fall to this from simple lack of UX.  The technical complications around securing a bitcoin wallet could leave people with bitcoins they don't realize have been stolen and transfered until they attempt to use them to pay for something.<p>I know bitcoin has strong cyptography behind it. That is a building block for secure software.  There is however a world of difference between the mathematical tools used to secure something and software that is secure in practice and use.<p>To me the highest risk area is how hard or easy it is for non technical people to use correctly, and how hard or easy it is for unscrupulous people to harm non-technical people who are trying to use it.",1306773150

(I <i>want</i> to see other languages raid Haskell, but it ends up being very easy to copy the form and entirely, utterly miss the substance. I see the same problem with Erlang copiers.)<p>First, the compiler forces you to unpack the error. Now, you can still write code that discards the error or fails to handle it, but you can't simply <i>forget</i>.<p>Second, you <i>can</i> compose these together:<p><pre><code>    bigOperation = do\n        a <- eitherOperation\n        b <- eitherOperation\n        c <- someOtherEitherOperation\n        return $ a + b + c\n</code></pre>\nWith the do notation in the Either monad, you'll get the first error in the sequence, or the final result; you do not need to handle each error individually. This is a choice you make on purpose; if you want to, you can, if you want to handle errors in some other manner, you can, etc, this is not ""the"" error handling technique in the language, it's just one that ships in the base library. Personally I don't much like it because people tend to use Either with a string in the error position, and I really hate it when strings are the base error type.<p>(Also, there is a bit of a problem composing together different bits of code that handle errors differently, which is a disadvantage of giving the programmer so much flexibility. The exceptions mechanisms may not be perfect but they are consistent.)<p>And, indeed, just copying the Either type into C(++/#) is copying the form and missing the substance. I don't know what the solution for C(++/#) is, none of those languages have rich enough abstraction to copy Haskell here.",1306772578

At 17 percent, the share was about half a percentage point higher than the previous year. These are the preliminary results calculated by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat) for the Federal Environment Ministry. This growth was achieved in spite of the sector being hampered by adverse weather conditions. As there was very little wind in 2010, the wind power yield of 36.5 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) was the lowest since 2006. Even so, wind energy remained the key pillar of renewables, with around a 6 percent share of the total electricity supply. Clear increases were recorded for electricity generation from biogas and the photovoltaic sector. Solar power almost doubled its contribution, covering around 2 percent of total electricity demand.<p>Current scenarios show that in just ten years, renewables can cover 40 percent of Germany's electricity supply. An increase of 12 terawatt hours (TWh) per year is considered realistic. (1 terawatt hour = 1 billion kWh).<p>The renewables' share in total final energy consumption for heat rose from 9.1 percent in 2009 to just under 10 percent in 2010. The renewables' share in fuel consumption rose slightly to an estimated 5.8 percent (2009: 5.5 percent).<p>Overall, in 2010 renewables covered around 11 percent of Germany's total final energy consumption for electricity, heat and fuels. This is significantly higher than the previous year (2009: 10.4 percent) and is remarkable because energy consumption was considerably higher than in 2009, due to both the economic recovery and the cold weather.<p>Renewables also increased their contribution to climate protection. In 2010, around 120 million tonnes of greenhouse gases were avoided through the use of renewable energies (2009: 111 million tonnes). Around 58 million tonnes of these savings can be attributed to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) alone.<p>The figures prove that renewable energies were able to keep pace with the economic recovery and continue their trend of a steadily growing share in our energy supply.<p>Alongside this, renewable energies also gained importance as an economic factor. Initial estimates for the BMU show that, at around 26 billion euros, investments in renewable energy installations were around one quarter higher than in 2009 (20.7 billion euros).<p>This development is reflected in the employment figures linked to the expansion of renewables. Last year, employment in renewables rose again and latest estimates show there are now around 370,000 jobs in the sector. This is an increase of around 8 percent compared to the previous year (around 339,500 jobs), and well over twice the number of jobs in 2004 (160,500).",1306771817

One can make the point that, in 99% of the cases, exceptions in a function should be handled as predictable actions. If a correct client needs to deal with it, it is better to use if/else than a try/catch clause. The later almost always makes to code more obscure and difficult to understand. There is a reason why in professional C programs most of the code goes to error handling: it is necessary. The equivalent Java code will just have one try/catch per line of code, or just let exceptions crash the app.",1306771802

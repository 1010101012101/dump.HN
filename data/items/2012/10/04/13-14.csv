I've found a few real gems that I would love to hire full-time someday, but lately I've been having a very hard time finding quality talent. I've had four hires in a row that accepted the job and then completely dropped off the face of the earth afterwards.<p>I've also run into quite a few contractors who lie about their skill set--hoping, I assume, to get ANY kind of work and then learn it as they go. It makes ramping someone up kind of frustrating... but once you find someone good to work with I've had nothing bad to say about it.",1349359180

You also make it so that when I say ""I forgot my password"" and fill in the wrong email address, I am sitting and waiting for a password reset email that never comes.

I don't want to push a slippery slope argument, but the term script kiddies implies someone with no special talents (merely the right commonly available tools). SQL injections are not technically difficult.<p>See the problem? If private information is being leaked, if servers are being breached, and it takes <i>no special skills</i>, and if these servers have been hacked for months, there's obviously a fundamental breakdown in the security chain of the organization. Security is not difficult, security is not something new, security is not something you can do without.

I was in a rush to catch the train this morning and I didn't have chance to elaborate, I shouldn't do that.<p>However, my point was that most of the algorithms used on that link (ANN, SVM, etc) had similar expressive power (VC dimension) and had been proved to have similar performance between them in object recognition.<p>People normally take advantage on their specific properties rather than paying too much attention how well the algorithm would perform (since either SVM and ANN are expected to perform reasonably well). I still maintain my opinion that any difference in classification performance is more likely to be related to how the team managed the data instead of the chosen algorithm.<p>Deep convolutional learning is the difference here and indeed seems to be an interesting architecture which the current state of the art only support ANN. But that doesn't mean that somebody wouldn't come up with a strategy for deep learning on SVM or another classification technique in the future.",1349358883

(and cookie management, but that's a different rant) The idea of using your own custom style sheets was always, at best, an extreme fringe feature.  Yes, markup has to be 'right' for this to work, and browser makers catered to poor markup way too much in the early days.  I'm not sure we can easily get out of it, but perhaps now... with a somewhat renewed focus on semantic markup and better CSS in browsers, we could encourage browsers to treat ""user-specified"" styling as a first class function of what it means to be a 'browser'?<p>Using Safari 5 right now, there's <i>no option</i> I can find to set a minimum font size.  A 'default' font and size, yes, but that seems to be ignored or overwritten by every site I go to.  It's 2012 and I still have to 'increase font size' on a number of sites I go to (and I know about keystrokes to do so - other people I know tend to just suffer with small fonts).",1349358875

It also matters to consider <i>American-born</i> students rather than all citizens and prospective citizens because we're trying to get an indication of what people think about the American labor market.  The best way to measure that is to look at people who are confined to the American labor market.<p>If we had a ""points-based"" immigration system like Canada, say, I would be asking how many graduates are American citizens.  But we don't.  Most international students I met were planning on either going ""back home"" or rising through further academic degrees (ie: grad-school) in order to continue their visas long enough to at least <i>try</i> for a Green Card and/or American citizenship.  The economic impact of the latter is limited to academia.... which gets us back to the very problem I've been trying to articulate: that academia (in the sense of teaching and research, <i>not</i> just university incomes or spending) has been killed off as a major economic engine in America.<p><a href=""http://infoproc.blogspot.co.il/2008/05/dont-become-scientist-philip-greenspun.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infoproc.blogspot.co.il/2008/05/dont-become-scientist...</a> -- here is our problem, described twice.

Some people I know have worked in the same industry for several years and have a good grasp on the problem domains they address.  That doesn't mean they know the solution to everything off the top of their head, but it  does mean they'll likely have time to figure it out, as they're in that business for the long term, and have incentives to get it right vs 'fire and forget and move to the next project'.<p>I'm in my 40s and have been programming, for 30 years.  Initially as a hobby (obviously) but getting paid to do it, first part time, then full time, for about 20 years.  I had this same conversation with an uncle last year - shouldn't I be doing something else (OK, not quite the same tone as the OP, but we had the discussion).<p>I have skills that allow me to solve problems for people.  Many people do as well, but with software, I do it with electrons, and can do it wherever and whenever I want.  In contrast to many other types of work which dictate location, tools, timing, software work is incredibly flexible.  But... more to the point, as more of the world continues to become software-based, the opportunities to offer my problem-solving skills to people increases at a rate few other industries/skills have enjoyed (or will continue to enjoy).<p>Even if I switched focus to work in ""company X"" vs ""company Y"", my core ability will still be ""problem solving with software"" - I just don't see that changing for me over the next 20-30 years.

4612145,comment,4610714,4611632,1,0,dasil003,,,"Right, well that's why I mentioned it.  This is an impedance mismatch between our systems.  PSN billing is based on account affiliation, MUBI geofiltering based purely on IP.<p>I'm not sure if they verify that you are in the UK when you create a UK PSN account or if it just requires a UK credit card, but at any rate, once you have it, you can use it anywhere in the world.  This conflicts directly with MUBI's licensing rights where we have different film rights in each country and can only stream certain films with certain subtitles in different countries.  Because we are integrated with PSN billing and we have a PPV option this makes it impossible to support a foreign account because the user would be paying the wrong amount, in the wrong currency, and this would not meet our agreements with rightsholders.  This is just one of many thorny issues (don't get me started on sub-regions like Isle of Man which have the same PSN store despite different ISO country).  Technically the gap could be bridged, but the sheer weight of the logic in the code and also for our accountants to sort out is not justifiable.<p>However, the essence of our service is that if you buy a subscription from us you can use it anywhere in the world.  Currently for PS3 that means you have to buy it from us and not from Sony, and also you do have to contact us to re-affiliate your MUBI account with a different PSN account if you move.  We have plans to improve that so you can have multiple PSN accounts affiliated with a single MUBI account though that itself is also a significant engineering initiative that has not made it to the top of the priority list yet.  As imperfect a solution as that is, once set up it will actually work even for people who regularly move between multiple countries, and I believe we are ahead of any premium content streaming company in that regard.",1349356875

4612088,comment,4607747,4610112,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"Academia can be <i>incredibly</i> lucrative for rockstar grant writers, leaders in scientific fields, and authors.<p>These folks typically don't command astronomical salaries (though they do get paid much, much more handsomely than you'd imagine). Rather, some of them publish bestsellers (and demand the university's help in getting access to leading magazines, publishers, press, etc.). Some of them start their own labs, companies, or institutions that are funded by the schools. Some of them clean up on the lecture circuit. Some researchers -- especially in biomedical fields -- make fortunes (for both their universities and themselves) by selling or licensing patents to private enterprise.<p>For instance, I'm a writer by hobby. As such, I tend to hang around a lot of other writers (note: I don't recommend this). A common complaint among writers is that writing doesn't pay well. And, on average, that's true. But the world of writing isn't a neat, Gaussian distribution of income. It's a power-law distribution. Most writers are lucky to clear $50k a year in academia, or working for a large and respectable publication. But Malcolm Gladwell earns well north of $10 million a year. Michael Lewis probably makes even more. And don't even get me started on fiction. The woman who wrote ""50 Shades of Grey"" makes, on average, $3 million <i>a week</i>. J.K. Rowling is a billionaire. Stephen King is probably a near-billionaire. That guy who crapped out ""The Da Vinci Code"" could just about afford to purchase the Mona Lisa from the Louvre, were he so inclined.<p>Writing, like academia, is an all-or-nothing sport. There tends to be a very small slice of outsized winners, and a very large slice of abject losers. I don't mean ""winners"" and ""losers"" in a pejorative sense. I mean it in the sense that the pie is divided very, very, very unevenly. The average is very low, but the high end is quite high.<p>This is in stark contrast to, say, i-banking -- wherein a small proportion make an outlandish amount of money, but everyone else still makes a really large chunk of money.",1349356082

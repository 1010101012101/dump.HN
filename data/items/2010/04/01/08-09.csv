It slowly becomes out of date -- very slow, much slower than any other book, but still.<p>Among the things that has significantly changed since the 20th anniversary edition are:<p>(a) agile/incremental methods in software development are now widespread. In the book, Brooks present himself as a big advocate of what could be called proto-agile, contrary to the waterfall model of his time, and<p>(b) internet service companies flourishing in the internet. The ""release early, release often"" model could not be practiced anywhere better than in the internet, and this mindset has a great impact on how we think about the software development in general (note that at the Brook's times there were no internet services at all)",1270111028

That way the international users won't have to try to guess how I want the addresses to validate, but they might run into errors from the third parties, and that validation might be slower, but at least we're down to a bare minimum of requirements.<p>You know how those credit card processors are picky with US addresses? Here's another hint: They can't do international validation either! Just pass in a different country and whatever garble the user entered and you're usually good to go, as long as the credit card number and cvc matches.<p>You know that CC billing address concept? That doesn't exist where I am. My credit cards don't have that. So when I'm asked to provide it, I enter complete garble, and it usually works every time. So don't worry about only giving well-formed data to the CC processors.",1270110746

You can define the core of the language as a macro processor and some base functionality, then define everything else on top of it.  A new implementation has to build the core, then gets the rest for free.  This is common in the Lisp world, but next to nonexistent outside it.",1270109675

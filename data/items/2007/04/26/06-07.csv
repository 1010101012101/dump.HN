You have to agree that YC's program schedule results in better resource management, is needed, and so, your claim of ""never setting deadlines"" as a general statement is false. To make it true, you would need to accept applicants off the timetable. (Actually, how much was the YC program schedule influenced by university calendars?)<p>As a personal statement though, I totally agree. Assuming a startup team or artist isn't starving, not setting deadlines makes total sense. I remember somebody in high school was required to build up a portfolio of artwork during the semester. It's a rather preposterous requirement, because if there is no inspiration, there is no art. Churning out a portfolio of unimpressive drawings is easy, but nothing is genuine. Alas, people who operate off of schedules cannot accommodate the uncertainty. Universities, for example.<p>Hell, if I owned a school, I'd try to recruit good students whenever they appear, any time of the year. If you can finish a course in one day, great. If it takes you 10 semesters, great, as long as it's worth it.",1177570531

As Douglas Adams wrote, a computer ""...was, on the other hand, very good at being a slow and dim-witted pupil.   ...  And the more slow, and dim-witted the pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas.  And that's really the essence of programming.""",1177568651

45377,comment,45374,45374,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"The idea aside, deleting my stuff would be incredibly annoying.  <p>Say the default is a day, which I assume it is from the write up.  There are a ton of valid reasons I might miss a day, or even a week, e.g. medical reasons.  And to come back and have my stuff deleted!  Man, I don't know what else to say about that except I don't like it.",1187818504
45376,comment,45298,45298,0,0,Goladus,,,"I sort of disagree with the example of wristwatches.  A wristwatch is not a blank canvas, it's a highly restrictive environment creatively.  People look at those constraints, look at the bigger picture (that a watch is also a clothing accessory) and then stretch the limits.  <p>Most people don't start with a blank canvas and come up with great ideas, the great ideas more often come when there is a need to figure out how to make the most of a limitation.

45374,story,,,6,18,palish,"New productivity tool launches Friday.  Thoughts and feature requests?",,"Hiya!  Straight to what this tool can do for you: It will help you accomplish something every single day.<p>Fill in the blank, ""I'm going to _____ every day.""  Thinking of something?  Great!  Now go out there and do it, then return to the tool and click ""I did it today!""  You'll be congratulated and given the opportunity to write about your experience and post a picture.<p>At that point, the picture becomes a link in your productivity chain.   After you've formed a few links in the chain, I bet you won't want to stop.  But if you do stop and miss a day, the entire chain breaks and everything is deleted.<p>Now, if you just want to use the tool for just that, all by your lonesome, that's just fine.  But we've included a social aspect to it as well.  Whenever another person is doing the same thing as you, each one of your chain links will be submitted to a centralized place where you'll be able to explore and upvote others' chain links and post comments to everyone.  <p>On the front page, you'll see the top 20 popular chains and the fastest growing chains for today, as well as the top comments and featured users.  Next to each chain is a plus sign that, when clicked, will enable you to do that same thing each day, too.  You can also explore and find interesting chains and users.<p>The time interval is adjustable.  You can do something every day, weekday, weekend or week.<p>The project was inspired by this post: <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/software/motivation/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/software/motivation/jerry-seinfelds-pr...</a>
 <p>We're launching on Friday at 10PM CST.  Everyone who registers in the first hour will start with 50 karma points, so bring a friend!  If you have any feature requests, just let us know and they'll be waiting for you at launch.<p>Common wisdom is that it's dangerous to let you all in on our secret before we're out there, but we wanted to give you the opportunity to make this tool better in your eyes.<p>Thanks for your critique guys!<p>Update: First feature request will be implemented for you: A vacation switch that you can toggle on and off.  If it's on, your chains are frozen and won't be deleted.  ",1187818299

Founders don't have the same rate of turnover and so have more interest in spending time to raise the sale price.",1187817772

45369,comment,45323,45323,0,0,henryw,,,"I think one of the traits is to be relentlessly going after results, getting stuff done. Result is what matters. And since results are not guaranteed, the best one could do is to religiously maximize his/her probably for success by doing/learning whatever is needed (within legal and moral bounds).<p>From Paul Graham's wealth creation article <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p>1) Be smart and/or learn a lot so you have a high multiplier on your productivity<p>2) ""You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured ... And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect."" Or in other words start your company or join a small startup producing things people want.<p>3) Take a lot of actions (with your high multiplier) in working on your company. ""Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years.""<p>4) Enjoy the show after you're done and while at it. (I added that one.)<p>This was about doing it by creating things. ""There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.""",1187817347

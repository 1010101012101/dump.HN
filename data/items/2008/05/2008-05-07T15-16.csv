I suspect that most of the people who buy the multiple-platinum-selling crap would just buy their music elsewhere if Apple stopped selling it. Initially, it would hurt Apple (due to reduction in revenue) and then it would hurt everyone because the music industry would probably get to bully everyone around even more.",1210175656

You use your connections to get a meeting with someone who works in the company, but who isn't necessarily the person who would make the final decision. Here is the general list of questions you might want to ask after giving your pitch:<p>Do you like the concept? why or why not?<p>What are the obstacles that would prevent implementation?<p>What metrics would you use to judge the effectiveness of our product / service?<p>What does your decision cycle look like?<p>Who'd be involved in making the decision? In other words, who would we talk to if we came back, or what parts of the organization?<p>What would they be considering?<p>Do you foresee any difficulties? Do you have any other suggestions?<p>If the decision maker likes the concept and the sale is potentially feasible, how would they evaluate it? What  metrics would they use? What would they charge end users? What profit targets would they need. How would they make their decision?<p>Can we talk in the future?<p>Unfortunately one of my startup advisors for a previous business idea gave me this list and I forgot to write down their name so I can't properly credit them.

I don't expect the journalist to detail all the researchers' lab controls but it certainly appears these biologists negligently compared multi-generational quinine exposed flies with a pristine fly colony. If that is true, I hope their paper defended the methodology or significantly hedged the results.<p>In humans, it is usual for small doses of quinine to cause cinchonism. From Wikipedia: ""Symptoms of mild cinchonism (which may occur from standard therapeutic doses of quinine) include flushed and sweaty skin, tinnitus, blurred vision, impaired hearing, confusion, reversible high-frequency hearing loss, headache, abdominal pain, rashes, lichenoid photosensitivity, vertigo, dizziness, dysphoria, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. Large doses of quinine may lead to severe symptoms of cinchonism: skin rashes, deafness (reversible), somnolence, diminished visual acuity or blindness, anaphylactic shock, and disturbances in cardiac rhythm or conduction, death from cardiotoxicity. Quinine overdose can also result in a rare form of hypersensitivity reaction termed blackwater fever that results in massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure.
In very high doses (higher than those used to treat malaria) during the first trimester of pregnancy quinine may act as an abortifacient, or cause birth defects, especially deafness.""",1210174801

As soon as you start getting revenue you may leave your job and find a loan that has minimum interest rate - on the other side start looking for angel investors to expand your startups. Make sure you do this with minimum debt and maximum chances of revenue starting right away so that just in case if you cant find angel or if your startup doesnt get you the revenue enough to sustain then you're still safe as you can go back to your full time job.

I've seen several startups struggle because they tried to bootstrap problems that were too hard.<p>Here are two suggestions.<p>First, build something subscription-based that you can finish in about 3 months and 25% of the money. Then support, promote, manage, and improve the site part-time, and get another part-time job. Or sink all your money into initial development, get another job, and manage the site on the side.<p>Second, build a consulting company instead of a product. A healthy programming/design shop can generate steady paychecks + profits, and you can reinvest the profits in a product. $50K is more than enough to start a consulting company.",1210172600

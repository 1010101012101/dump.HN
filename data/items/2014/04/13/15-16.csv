7581694,comment,7581226,7581530,5,0,lambda,,,"<p><pre><code>  This provides its own rebuttal. Running out of funds \n  necessary to pay for core commitments is not &quot;to the \n  benefit of GNOME&quot;, and certainly not in-line with their \n  charter.\n</code></pre>\nOf course running out of funds is not to the benefit of GNOME. The running out of funds part was an accident; no one wanted to do that. If there were any other program that had similar characteristics; something where the foundation were paying out a lot of money with the expectation of being reimbursed, but were not reimbursed as fast as they had expected, it would have had the same effect.<p>I think you need to separate your distaste for the program in the first place, from the immediate problem that they ran into a cashflow problem running it.<p><pre><code>  to create a computing platform for use by the general \n  public that is completely free software...\n  promote the use and development of GNOME software.\n</code></pre>\nAn internship program tailored towards a demographic that is traditionally heavily under-represented in both the users and developers of the free software eco-system sounds like exactly what the Gnome Foundation should be doing. Note the &quot;general public&quot; part; in order to reach the general public, and not just a fairly small niche market of existing free software enthusiasts, they need to broaden their appeal to demographics which don&#x27;t traditionally use or work on the project.<p>Remember, this money is being used directly for the development of Gnome; these internships are for development of Gnome and other components of the free software stack, like the Linux Kernel, Firefox, and so on.<p><pre><code>  This appears to be no small matter of malfeasance by \n  virtue of clear overreach beyond their charter.\n</code></pre>\nWhoa, whoa. That&#x27;s a rather strong accusation; you are accusing them of willfully harming the foundation against its charter?<p>The foundation has been running this program for several years, and the membership has never objected to it. It&#x27;s pretty clear that the membership does not believe this program to be at odds with the mission of the foundation.<p>Now, obviously the financial mismanagement part is a problem, which the board of directors should be working on fixing. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to throw the whole program out, just be more careful about working on cashflow.<p><pre><code>  Is there a mechanism by which the board can be recalled? \n  It does not seem at all unwarranted.\n</code></pre>\nAre you a member of the Gnome Foundation? If not, why do you care so much about how it operates, and sets its priorities; or if you care so much, why don&#x27;t you become a member and get involved?",1397404738

You cannot paraphrase one into the other at all.<p>In order to asses whether it&#x27;s an stereotype or not, we have to set up some kind of measure of perfectionism.

My anecdotes, having lived in Germany and very briefly in Japan, match that of the original post: I was continuously baffled with the attention to detail displayed everywhere in Tokyo. It&#x27;s just in a whole different level. And that of course does not make them perfect (what does that even mean?). Whether this attitude historically stems from Europe, is a second order tangent.<p>Your argument seems to be: Japanese are not particularly perfectionist (no more than Colombians, Danish, Turkish for example).

They&#x27;re not driving any white males out and they&#x27;re not forcing anybody to quit, they&#x27;re just expanding the contributor pool. This is a good thing. If the contributor base was 98% female and you were getting a paid internship, you would not be bitching in a HN post right now.<p>The fact that the budget FAQ largely describes invoicing failures during the operation of an internship program makes it confusing that you spend your whole post railing against an <i>entirely imaginary</i> evil plot where the GNOME Foundation&#x27;s money is drained away by a supposedly exclusionary program that recruits and pays qualified interns.<p>If you feel so unfairly discriminated against, maybe you should prove your inherent superiority by outperforming all these supposedly unqualified interns as a programmer and contributor.<p>GSoC outreach alone would not necessarily address defects in the administration of GSoC. It is possible Google&#x27;s administration of that program has systemic issues that result in the exclusion of qualified women (and men, for that matter!) Having multiple groups running internship programs and sponsorships is good because it means they can compete to find the best way to run things.<p>Your closing statement demonstrates your flawed thinking: Of course a push for inclusion is biased, because it focuses on the people that are excluded in order to include them. The program doesn&#x27;t care about you because you don&#x27;t need any help from the program!

In PHP 5 you got the __construct() magic method, but as a fallback, the method named to your class still works as constructor.<p>The same holds for properties defined with var instead of public/protected/private. For compatibility again, the var keyword is just interpreted as a public property.<p>As a third example, PHP5 came with an OOP system with support for interfaces, abstract classes and the final keyword. In PHP4, this wasn&#x27;t available. So, there is no PHP4 code which uses these concepts, making them work in PHP5 as well. Obviously, this doesn&#x27;t work the same way around.<p>There are some backwards compatibility issues, but these are minor in contrast to what you probably had written in PHP4 back then [1]<p>Now, for Py2 vs Py3 this is a completely different story. Py2 code doesn&#x27;t run automatically on Py3. See this answer [2], as there were so many porting issues developers didn&#x27;t had the time to overcome the overhead just to port the code.

Unnecessary incompatibilities in the C-extension-module implementation layer. And so on. The list of incompatibilities was just huge.<p>Later several of them where dropped, like the string literal trouble ... But than the trouble was already done. Many extension modules where not lifted to the new version, since the overhead was to big.<p>I think, many more projects would have adopted Py3, if more extension modules would support it.<p>The huge library of extension modules was always the strength of Python.

7581572,comment,7581309,7581309,39,0,Udo,,,"There is something to be learned from reasonable Kickstarter campaigns that successfully complete their funding. First, the video. I get the feeling that a lot of the successful video pitches are professionally produced, even though they&#x27;re often made to look casual. And there&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> of emphasis on the videos.<p>You guys put your main emphasis on making the text part informative - maybe too informative. I think it&#x27;s no coincidence that many successful KS projects look like they&#x27;re already finished. Maybe a lot of them are indeed already finished, but the rest are certainly faking it very elaborately. There&#x27;s good business sense in doing that: Kickstarter has become somewhat of a pre-order platform, and people are used to ordering what they see, not what it might become after funding.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be overly critical towards crowd funding, but one of the big illusions &quot;sold&quot; by crowd funding platforms is that anyone can get their pet project funded. In reality a lot of the people (if not indeed most of them) you see doing well on Kickstarter are extremely well-connected on social media or otherwise well-known. Crowd funding is a way of leveraging that kind of clout. If you don&#x27;t have that, it can be tough even getting your message in front of the right audience.<p>One does not simply walk into Kickstarter. Successful people put a lot of effort into looking like they are just casually letting the world know about their thing and, behold, great fame and money follows. But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s actually happening behind the scenes. Crowd funding is not the big equalizer, it&#x27;s just another way of leveraging marketing potential that already exists.<p>If you can&#x27;t put a check mark on at least two of these three things I talked about (professional production, pre-existing audience, potential for runaway virality), chances are it&#x27;s not going to work out.<p>So honestly, no I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll reach your funding goal. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad project. In fact, I would love following it over time to see what you&#x27;re doing. If you feel strongly about the concept, consider doing it on the side or taking a few months off - this is the kind of project that looks like it could very well be implemented as a hobby. Use that development time to churn out videos and blog about your progress. Slowly build up that audience. By the time you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ll already have customers and fans lined up.",1397402714

7581510,comment,7581226,7581303,5,0,lambda,,,"> Why was &quot;The Outreach Program for Women&quot; allowed to so significantly impact Gnome&#x27;s primary mission?<p>One of the Gnome Foundations primary missions is &quot;Fund Receipt and Disbursement&quot;: &quot;The foundation will be in charge of disbursing these funds to the benefit of GNOME and, to the extent possible, in accordance with the wishes of the benefactor&quot; (<a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Resources/Charter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Resources/Charter</a>).<p>The funding of the OPW sounds like it&#x27;s completely appropriate here. Several benefactors and organizations have wanted to fund this activity, and the Gnome Foundation provides the means for them to do so.<p>> Why is the Gnome Foundation is funding and administering this program to begin with?<p>It is a multi-organizational program, between several different projects. It looks like rather than setting up a whole new organization just for this one program, they decided to have one group do the organization and running of the program, while the other groups contribute money to that one. It can be expensive and inefficient to set up too many new organizations; there is a lot of overhead to a new organization.<p>It looks like the problem is that because the OPW funds internships, the Gnome Foundation winds up having to pay them at a steady rate, while it may get payments from the other organizations in lump sums. It sounds like the Gnome Foundation has not been keeping up with invoicing the other organizations, so while they&#x27;ll be in the black once everyone settles up, right now they&#x27;ve run short of cash on hand due to all of the outstanding balances.<p>> it absolutely should not financially impact Gnome&#x27;s ability to ship Gnome.<p>Is shipping Gnome the job of the Gnome foundation? As far as I can tell, the foundation is there to organize conferences, run the server infrastructure, and run programs like the OPW. Actual development is mostly done by member companies, like Red Had and SUSE.<p>> Given that the outreach program was started in response to the lack of women candidates for Google&#x27;s Summer of Code, this program could (and given fiduciary responsibilities, should) have focused solely on non-exclusionary outreach to women Summer of Code candidates.<p>That&#x27;s not necessarily the best way to address the problem. It may be that certain aspects of how Google&#x27;s Summer of Code works inherently biased towards men; or at least, people who are already fairly comfortable in the community and with open source software, which given the current substantial gender imbalance in the community, can mean that it&#x27;s not really a suitable way to encourage more women to get involved.<p>Running the internships separately from the Google Summer of Code is perfectly fine; they just need to do a better job of managing the finances.",1397401523

Backing up a deployed application is kind of silly when the tagged releases should be sitting in your source control and that the press of a button have an entire server built and configured from scratch that is <i>identical to the one you need</i>. Then storing that configuration in source control.<p>Backing up configuration files and what-not is also pretty silly and indicative of bad devop practices.<p>The database should be <i>versioned</i> and maintained with a <i>migration tool</i>. So the only feature of the database that needs backing up should be the data it holds - live replication servers that can act as background backup slaves are perfect for this.<p>The only stuff you should be backing up on your servers are the latest log file rotations, user-generated data in the database, and any critical files that were also generated / uploaded by your users (but technically, you should be storing those in S3 with duplicates in another availability zone).<p>One other thought: people usually don&#x27;t think to encrypt their backups.

They can tell you the basics about what records you need to keep and when youâ€™ll need to do things.<p>After youâ€™ve done something the first once or twice, you usually have a reasonable understanding of what the essentials are, and you can probably do more of the work yourself to save time/money. The professionals can then become more advisors and reviewers than the people doing routine paperwork.<p>I also strongly agree with &#x27;jakobe about finding professionals who are used to working with small companies, preferably by personal recommendation. Itâ€™s much more than just pricing: the whole way they work is often very different to how bigger accountancy and legal firms who are used to working with bigger companies work.<p>As a final tip, in most places there are organisations that support small businesses that you/your company can join. These usually have a modest cost, but IME membership can easily pay for itself many times over. Some useful services they might offer that save you time and/or money include providing templates for common types of legal document (which you can use as a starting point if youâ€™re drafting yourself), providing legal and/or tax helplines (which you can phone when you just need five minutes speaking with someone who knows what theyâ€™re talking about), and producing general guidance on things like contracts, tax, and insurance, with a focus on issues affecting small businesses. You might also find you can get more attractive pricing on things like business supplies and insurance through such organisations, as they have much more bargaining power collectively than any single small business has on its own.",1397401433

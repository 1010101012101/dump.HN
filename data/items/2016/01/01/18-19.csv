10822759,comment,10804395,10806389,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Since no experts replied, I&#x27;ll try to make an attempt. The FPGA is a series of configurable logic blocks and routing hardware that simulate other logic. All digital hardware reduces down to primitive logic. So, FPGA&#x27;s can do about any digital design. The real limitations are in performance, energy use, and cost.<p>The flexibility of an FPGA, from routing & configurable logic, takes up a lot of space that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be in the system. The blocks themselves are larger and slower than the primitives they simulate. The extra delays from this mean the FPGA can&#x27;t be as fast as dedicated hardware. If FPGA simulates a CPU or GPU, the real CPU or GPU will always be faster due to optimized logic.<p>The other issue is power. The FPGA has all kinds of circuits that have to be ready to load up new configuration and simulate something else. Due to dynamic nature, the active parts also use more energy with all the extra circuitry. The result is that FPGA&#x27;s always use more power than the custom chip.<p>The last one, cost, comes from the business model. No chips outside of recent GPU&#x27;s have challenged FPGA&#x27;s without going bankrupt or being a tiny niche player. Additionally, the EDA tools to make use of them are ridiculously hard to build with Big Two (Altera and Xilinx) investing a ton to get as good as they are. They also give them out cheap to free. So, anyone implementing a FPGA sold at cost will be unlikely to compete with Big Two on tools that make the most of the FPGA. That means anyone using FPGA&#x27;s will pay high unit prices to line Big Two&#x27;s pockets for quite some time.<p>Far as the structure, you have to map the hardware to the structure. Hardware is often done in pieces that connect to each other in a grid. So, the mapping isn&#x27;t terrible. It&#x27;s just hard to do efficiently.",1451673573
10822758,comment,10820158,10820820,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"There will always be political deception in the debate over choosing metrics. But one thing that indicates a good management structure is that after metrics have been chosen, there is a very strict and quantitative process for holding people accountable for the metric.<p>In things like Agile/Scrum, it&#x27;s usually the opposite. Whatever the metrics are doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that the process of holding people accountable is <i>intentionally not consistent or quantitative</i>. One week some burndown graph is the end of the world for your team because some manager was cranky. The next week, a different team with the same burndown graph is lauded as extraordinary and hard-working.<p>It&#x27;s all about giving managers the maximum possible surface area from which to cherry pick metrics that suit their changing political circumstances. It&#x27;s hardly at all about actually having an accurate measure of productivity or adherence to timelines.<p>I would argue that this means the subjective debates about metrics aren&#x27;t very important. Pick some metrics that other people have used, even if they are crappy. Hell, even use Agile/Scrum metrics.<p>But whatever metrics you do use, you have to create a bulletproof way of holding people accountable for them. If doing this leads to bad business outcomes because the metrics weren&#x27;t good enough, then you can iterate on the metrics themselves and bring them more into alignment with your business constraints. But you can&#x27;t do anything if the process of holding people accountable is subjected to significant political manipulation.<p>One of the best tools for this is the use of internal prediction markets. Employees must &quot;buy shares&quot; in the project outcomes they believe will be true (e.g. &quot;we will solve problem X by the stated timeline Y and under budget Z&quot;). If you commit to these timeline and budget metrics, say, and you &quot;buy shares&quot; in this business outcome, then you only get paid if the outcome happens. It doesn&#x27;t matter if some unforeseen event prevented it (you should have impounded the probability of that unforeseen event into your model for the price you are willing to pay for a share of the business outcome).<p>In this manner, people are held accountable for their true beliefs. DARPA and some defense contractors have done experiments on using these to govern expensive military contracts. What is amazing is that often the experiments show that projects governed by prediction markets tend to succeed much more frequently, they tend to be completed fully rather than only partially meeting the required specs, and even after being finished faster and more completely, they <i>also</i> come in under budget more often.<p>And the reaction to the use of prediction markets within the companies where it has been tried: outrage and complete refusal to ever work with them again. Managers become so angry that they don&#x27;t have the option to engage in political manipulation, to secure blame insurance and make sure they get paid regardless of the business outcome, that they outright refuse to use this technique which is overwhelmingly positive for the business bottom line.<p>There have also been lots of studies showing that prediction markets are very robust against rogue actors or people who attempt analogues of &quot;insider trading&quot; and so forth -- rather than this stuff sabotaging projects, it actually creates a free lunch for other internal stakeholders, and is quickly defeated by the internal market.<p>Of course, these types of markets are only as good as the highest level managers who oversee their internal use, so they are not magic solutions or anything. But the point is that this method exists, and has been shown to work well, and all it costs is for managers to give up their ability to game systems with political manipulation. And that cost appears to induce outrage in most managers, who are unwilling to give up political manipulation in exchange for truly better overall business outcomes.",1451673569

Think of what a bloated mess a ClojureScript app would be if it had to include the <i>entire</i> ClojureScript standard library with every build. This is exactly what&#x27;s happening in JS world, where developers include by default the entirety of any utility libraries they&#x27;re using when they&#x27;re only calling a handful of functions from them.<p>Before anyone starts suggesting &quot;just use Closure Compiler for JS projects&quot;, it&#x27;s really not that simple (at least when I last looked into it). There&#x27;s a huge amount of friction involved in using the Closure Compiler for a regular JS project (most of which wouldn&#x27;t apply to a ClojureScript project because its JS output is machine-generated, and its build chain is designed to work <i>exclusively</i> with the Closure Compiler and all its quirks), namely writing all your code as Closure Modules, defining externs for any third party libraries you use, and setting up the JVM-based compiler itself and integrating it with the rest of your build tools.<p>I hope to see some improvement in this area with the dawn of ES6 modules, since they were designed from the ground up with static analysis in mind. Robust and accessible dead-code elimination and cross module code motion for ES6 modules could easily bring about a <i>revolution</i> in JS code sizes on the web.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/</a>",1451673346

My command chain cares about delivery of services and products at our below the budget, period.<p>This is classic duplicitous manager babble that really just means, &quot;I want authority to decide arbitrarily when we should adhere to bureaucratic rules or project management methodology (... or good coding practices, or sane deadlines, or ...).&quot;<p>When people <i>actually</i> care about the business bottom line (what you describe as delivery of services and products at [or] below the budget), they tend to behave rationally and expand their point of view to include things like bureaucratic necessity, the importance of strictly adhering to chosen project management and code quality standards and never cherry picking which business concerns are supposed to override them, and so forth.<p>When people up the command chain don&#x27;t behave rationally about this stuff, it&#x27;s generally because they are bad at their jobs. Bad managers see subordinates as work receptacles who should &quot;just get shit done&quot; and &quot;solve my problems&quot; without any understanding as to how it works or what constraints from reality actually mean in terms of unpackaging business priorities and mapping them to actions to accomplish them.<p>As a manager caught in the middle, you can chose which way you want to go. Appease the batshit bureaucrats by hammering down on your own subordinates, bottomlessly compromising away standards all in the name of so-called business bottom line.<p>Or stand up to them and explain what it takes to actually deliver products. If you lose your job doing this, it&#x27;s a good thing! It allows you to rejection sample bad employers and more quickly find good employers where the managers realize that the phrase &quot;business priorities&quot; has to be recursively unpacked into all the messy details of project management, budgets, deadlines, work/life balance, and so on, and who actually care to do so (and yes, they really, really exist, just not embedded in brainfucked corporate/organizational hierarchies).<p>One example from my own career: I worked on a team of developers for an education technology company. The company acquired a start-up that had created a suite of learning applications. The code was an unbelievable mess: written in a (bad) proprietary language, poor anti-patterns all over, no usage of proper version control or issue tracking, no sane build or deployment system.<p>To boot, the apps themselves consistently got poor reviews from users in all of the app stores and review sites. And instead of fixing the app and improving the project management methods (truly the only two options for even short term profitability of the app), the management decided to essentially throw gas on the fire and pursue a strategy similar to regulatory capture, and attempt to make the creation phase of the learning materials (things only professors, teachers, or administrators would do) into the first-class constructs of the whole system, further crapifying the experience and functionality for end users (students) and driving app engagement and reviews even lower.<p>After a while of this utterly not working, there were several heart to heart meetings between engineers, middle management, and senior management, at which point it came to light that one of the main reasons we were even pursuing this strategy at all is that there was somewhat of a dick-measuring competition going on between the company&#x27;s CTO (who was in charge of this portfolio of products), and the CEO of the start-up that had been acquired.<p>Apparently the folks in that start-up, once their golden handcuffs contracts ended, basically took most of the same e-learning idea and tried to spin it to sell it for corporate learning (like corporate training videos and stuff). And our CTO, who was under pressure about the whole deal and our continued poor app ratings, took it personally and basically started enforcing business strategy solely to &quot;stick it&quot; to that startup CEO and compete directly with him for a new market (corporate learning) that we weren&#x27;t set up to service and had no prior ties into and had no infrastructure to deal with.<p>And of course, every middle manager in between was feeding all of us engineers the same line of bull as from your comment. Everything was just &quot;upper management cares about most efficient delivery of our product&quot; -- when it was patently obvious that they did not at all care about this and that we were being reprioritized constantly to service the arbitrary whim of the CTO.<p>And because this was a huge organization with tens of thousands of employees, consistently losing tens of millions of dollars on a monthly basis to competitor apps who actually took software quality seriously didn&#x27;t even register as a blip to worry about. If our whole team got laid off because this CTO&#x27;s strategy of irrational pissing contest competition didn&#x27;t pan out, who cares? We&#x27;ll just slap some crap on the front about how the market is changing or we need to streamline or restructure or whatever.<p>My main takeaway was basically that any time a middle manager tells you a decision is being made because it is important for the efficiency of reaching the company&#x27;s bottom line goals, that manager is just spewing bullshit.<p>When that stuff really happens, non-bullshit-spewers will actually sit down with you and explain it, in nitty gritty detail, and will actually listen to and value your input about whether it&#x27;s a good idea or not. They won&#x27;t rush to label you as a &quot;batshit bureaucrat&quot; or a &quot;religious adherent&quot; of quality practices. They&#x27;ll just listen and be open and transparent.",1451672808

Looking at the wikipedia article on Prop 13, it says:<p>&quot;It also prohibited reassessment of a new base year value except for in cases of (a) change in ownership, or (b) completion of new construction.&quot;<p>I live in Los Angeles and we have a similar problem being a popular location in California. Basically, there are people living in their homes paying the same taxes they paid in 1978, while anyone trying to buy a similar house will owe modern taxes. So you might be paying $15,000/yr. in taxes and your next door neighbor in a comparable house is literally paying $500/yr. That makes no sense. I&#x27;ve owned property in other states and assessments are done every 1-5 years.<p>The fallout is that certain areas pay significantly lower taxes, thus contributing significantly less to the community than other areas. It&#x27;s made worse by the fact that if you inherit your house from your parents (or if they gift it to you before they die), you continue paying the 1978 taxes (or whatever year they bought or built the house). That&#x27;s insane and it&#x27;s unfair. It has nothing to do with how people vote. If they paid their fair share, you might have a point, but they don&#x27;t, unless they decide to do construction on their house.

The US News article is a summary of a research report he published based on an empirical study of job openings. His research is also cited in the BLS report I linked to, so I don&#x27;t believe there is contention. I believe his methodology is more pertinent on this topic, since he looked at how long it took to fill positions rather than second order metrics like salaries.<p>&quot;and that 32 percent of computer science graduates not employed in information technology attributed their situation to a lack of available jobs.&quot;  &quot;unless you are arguing 32% of CS graduates are completely worthless?&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t read that as 32% of CS graduates couldn&#x27;t find jobs. It was 32% of CS graduates who couldn&#x27;t find jobs attributed it to lack of open positions. More below:<p>&quot;All you&#x27;ve really shown is CS has matured to the point where a good software engineer is on par with other engineering fields in terms of business value and their salary is starting to reflect that. That isn&#x27;t a sign of a shortage but rather an indication the quality of engineer is more important than the quantity of engineer.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think the maturing of CS is a recent phenomenon. Fred Brooks wrote about quality and output of software engineers 40 years ago. What has changed recently is a rapid growth in the number of CS positions:<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/s...</a><p>Since it takes time for people to build skills, I&#x27;d assert this naturally results in a shortage of more senior engineers. Every company has a distribution of new hires (that require training and mentoring) and experienced engineers. I see this as an argument to increase H1Bs to bring in experienced engineers.<p>Although we have seen an uptick in the number of CS graduates in the US, it has historically been low, and dropped after the last downturn:<p><a href=""http://www.itworld.com/article/2833432/it-management/american-college-students-aren-t-flocking-to-computer-science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itworld.com/article/2833432/it-management/america...</a><p>On the other hand, other countries like China and India have been churning out significantly more CS graduates for years (Table 1.1):<p><a href=""http://www.engineeringuk.com/_resources/documents/Engineering_Graduates_in_China_and_India_-_EngineeringUK_-_March_2012.pdf#page=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringuk.com/_resources/documents/Engineerin...</a><p>Which would create natural pressure for CS engineers to move to the US.<p>[edit: clarified a sentence that didn&#x27;t make much sense]",1451672450

I have dealt with OCD and depression-like systems for a long time now. 90%+ of the time I&#x27;m &quot;fine&quot; to &quot;great.&quot; Another 9.9% I feel like scum for no good reason. That last 0.1% is what sucks -- that&#x27;s the suicidal thoughts.<p>Holidays that are the worst, when everybody seems to be paying each other extra attentions and I find myself feeling lonely/forgotten. Last night, I had raging suicidal thoughts for a few hours (about the length of the usual bout). These thoughts are not directed or particularly purposeful.<p>When I have these thoughts, I badly want to talk to somebody about them. It&#x27;s like the monster in your closet -- in the light of day it&#x27;s less scary. But I can&#x27;t, and it sucks! If I go to a shrink about this, I would likely be involuntarily committed and be greatly impacted in my professional life, etc.<p>Suicide is a taboo topic and it&#x27;s too bad for those who struggle with suicidal thoughts, because they have to keep them inside. I&#x27;ve brought them up to some &quot;friends&quot; before and the reaction is that I must be crumbling, etc. There&#x27;s almost a sense of shame from these people, like they&#x27;ve accidentally seen you naked.<p>I keep this to myself, but the most productive thing is to confront the issue. The best way I&#x27;ve been able to do that is by reading things written by/about suicide <i>not</i> from the perspective of &quot;gotta save you!&quot; This might sound odd, but places like /r/SanctionedSuicide (which isn&#x27;t really what it sounds like, if you recoiled) actually makes me feel respected and not ashamed. Looking through a different lens, I see that my life is pretty good and I have many things to live for! When I feel this way I read the generally &quot;gotta save you!&quot; stuff too because hey, it&#x27;s nice and positive, but in isolation it&#x27;s quite patronizing.<p>Mentally sound people seem to immediately equate suicidal thoughts with an imminent life-and-death struggle and have the accompanying &quot;EMERGENCY!!&quot; reaction, and that is simply not how this works.",1451672317

First, a clarification:<p>> Do you think that advances in interstellar travel capability will appear out of thin air?<p>No.<p>It should have been obvious from my post that this is a straw man, that I&#x27;m not arguing to halt all science and wait for advancements out of thin air. I want to pursue science efficiently, because we have limited resources. Also, the time scales involved here will radically change the nature of the problem beyond our comprehension.<p>This 5 billion year problem you want to start tackling today changes immensely if in 1% of 1% of that time our descendants are all clouds of digitally encoded consciousness that propagate primarily through EM radiation and psychic clouds of gas. I&#x27;m not saying that change is particularly likely, but some change on that magnitude is all but certain on this time scale (ie, 1.5 times as long it took proto-bacteria to turn into apes).<p>Suppose cavemen suddenly had a revelation that air transportation would some day change the world. It would be foolish and dangerous if they immediately devoted their free time trying to jump as high as possible, rather than just working on fire and wheels and spears.<p>Ultimately fire, wheels, and spears are foundational technologies for the disciplines that made flight and rocketry possible. So even though they seem like distractions from air travel, they&#x27;re actually the most efficient path to solving that problem.<p>This is all the more obvious for probes, telescopes, and rovers. Those are the wheels, fire, and spears of space. Those all give us incrementally more information about the very nature of the universe, the nature of other possible planets, and how to build functioning intelligent machines that can survive in hostile environments. If there&#x27;s some way to bend space to our will for instantaneous interstellar travel, or some way to get highly complex machines to shepherd us among the stars, we discover it there, not by putting a guy on a treadmill in microgravity.",1451672275

At some point in your life, you may have to make that choice.<p>I think that there are two problems with this.  (EDIT:  &#x27;Problems&#x27; is a bad word.  I don&#x27;t mean two things that make it wrong, but rather two things that require a careful reading to appreciate fully.  I should have said &#x27;subtleties&#x27;.)<p>First, and most importantly, I think that people think that being exceptional <i>is</i> a choice.  Thus, someone says &quot;ah, I shall be exceptional!&quot;, and sits back and waits to become so.  <i>Being</i> exceptional is not a choice; <i>becoming</i> exceptional is, though it is a slow process, subject to setbacks, and not guaranteed of even eventual success (unless—as is perhaps uniquely appropriate here—one is willing to move the goalposts when necessary, and find success where one is).<p>Second, I take your explicit point to be the decision between being accepted and being exceptional, but I&#x27;ll respond as if it were between being conformist and being exceptional (which I took to be the subtext).  After the problem is surmounted of deciding just to <i>be</i> exceptional, and realising that one must <i>become</i> so, I think that sometimes people confuse blind non-conformity with reasoned non-conformity.  That is, a decision not to conform just in order <i>not</i> to be part of the crowd is just as silly as a decision to conform to be part of the crowd.  Rather, make your decisions as you will, regardless of the pressure of the crowds, with the idea that you will sometimes agree with and (probably) more often disagree with them, and become exceptional in that way.",1451672259

If you show any hesitation \nabout submitting to this process, you&#x27;ll be coerced into compliance, usually by the police. The police will have guns.<p>It does nobody any good to sugarcoat the unpleasantness. The experience of the emergency mental health process, or stories about it, shock people.

But we cannot responsibly suggest that we can motivate that reform by telling the mentally ill to go on strike against the system. Many people in need of emergency mental care will return to normal function in days or weeks, even when the safe space that gives them room to recover is unpleasant, the doctors are remote and unhelpful, and the police are at the door.<p>† <i>(There are subtle differences between this outcome and &quot;involuntary commitment&quot;, but I would understand anyone who suggested that they&#x27;re distinctions without differences; perhaps the best term to use for this would be &quot;temporary involuntary commitment&quot;).</i>",1451671675

We would prefer to have a look at your GitHub repo or a mobile app that you have built, over your academic/educational qualification. We are a founding team of engineers, and understand that good engineering is part science part art, we would like to provide you the tools for the science and the time for the art. We are expanding the team to build the next version of our true multi-tenant platform with a few thousand events happening per second.<p>Data Scientists: We wish to push to edge of what is possible, and advance the field of routing problems itself. If Travelling thief, Knapsack, Capacity planning and other optimisation problem excite you, we are looking for you. We are team of PhD scientists and engineers with background in stats, working on building faster & more scalable implementation of NP-hard problems, or even a combination of a few NP-Hard problems.<p>While we have pizza, beer, whisky, drones, oculus rifts, raspberry PIs on the house, the biggest perk we provide you is a remarkable team.

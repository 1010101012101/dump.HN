A strong signal of belief is your willingness to place money behind an idea.  Probably the best example of someone placing money behind a radical idea is Peter Thiel when he created Thiel Fellowship.<p>I think you would be well received if you were to offer full scholarship and stipend equal to the participants salary.",1311512394

  large as that of a Homo sapiens, perhaps larger,
  indicating their brain size may have been comparable, as
  well. In 2008, a group of scientists created a study using
  three-dimensional computer-assisted reconstructions of
  Neanderthal infants based on fossils found in Russia and
  Syria, showing that they had brains as large as modern
  humans' at birth and larger than modern humans' as
  adults.[8] On average, the height of Neanderthals was
  comparable to contemporaneous Homo sapiens. Neanderthal
  males stood about 165168 cm (6566 in), and were heavily
  built with robust bone structure. They were much stronger
  than Homo sapiens, having particularly strong arms and
  hands.[9] Females stood about 152156 cm (6061 in)
  tall.[10]

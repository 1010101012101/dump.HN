7915787,comment,7912973,7912973,1,0,danford,,,"Cannabinoids are very interesting. They&#x27;re naturally occurring in both plants and animals and researches believe the Endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a very large role in homeostasis. Cannabinoids have even been shown to induce apoptosis (essentially reversing cancer cell growth).<p>Within different strains of marijuana you get different ratios of different cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBN, etc.) and the self-medicators have discovered that these different ratios are good for treating different ailments.<p>I&#x27;m a firm believer that all cannabinoids need to be fully legal (and the cannabis plant material) so they can be studied in greater detail. I believe one day we&#x27;ll see cannabinoids in our daily vitamin and mineral supplements (probably not the intoxicating kind though).",1403182708

Especially in meetings, and especially in meetings with German clients. Meetings are serious and very efficient here. I don&#x27;t even smile at the beginning during introductions.<p>I also learned that the German-style of an employee review is quite different than in the US. In the US my reviews always started with the good things I did - my accomplishments, and then the bad things but the focus of the review was on the positive. Here, the review starts with the failures and how you can improve yourself, and then covers the accomplishments to about the same degree that the failures are covered in the US.<p>Self-assessments are more honest here too. I don&#x27;t think American&#x27;s are being dishonest when they assess themselves in their review - I just think that Americans aren&#x27;t good at critical self-evaluation.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in Switzerland, Germany, and France and they are all very different from each other. Germans are very straightforward and would be considered &#x27;not nice&#x27; in the US. The French are political - they may appear nice while they stab you in the back. Germany-speaking Switzerland is more like Germany, but the Swiss are easier to work with - not as rigid. I only had a few projects in French-speaking Switzerland and only one of those were with native French-speaking Swiss but they seemed nicer than the French.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;ve come to prefer how things work where I live now.

The business unit as a sports team idea is a bit tired and cliche at this point because it&#x27;s been a comparison made for at least 50 years.<p>But that speaks to the cliche&#x27;s validity.

7915730,comment,7915503,7915503,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"I worked at a company once that conflated mean-spirited policies with &quot;just business&quot;. The result was a downfall that was <i>entirely</i> preventable.<p>Vacation and sick leave were combined (&quot;PTO&quot;) which meant that you had to take a vacation day if you got sick. The result of this was that people came into work when ill and <i>everyone</i> was less productive. Very little ever got done in the winter, because it was just one constant office-wide cold. (I had so many colds, that season, that I saw a doctor to find out if something was wrong with my immune system.)<p>Open-plan offices are another penny-wise, pound-foolish institution. They&#x27;re not used because they&#x27;re &quot;collaborative&quot; or &quot;hip&quot; but because they&#x27;re cheap, and they&#x27;re cheap because they&#x27;re shitty. The result, however, is high turnover, increased sick load, distraction and antagonism. There&#x27;s also an overwhelming amount of evidence that open-plan offices hurt the best employees the most, which means you&#x27;re losing off the top. That&#x27;s not where you want to lose.<p>The killer was when it bought (<i>cough</i> rescued) another company and installed the acquired company&#x27;s upper management. The new regime&#x27;s first move was to kill the acquiring company&#x27;s R&D team-- not because it wasn&#x27;t doing useful work (it was) but because &quot;their side&quot; (the acquiring company) didn&#x27;t have an R&D team. So a high-performing R&D team that had already built some powerful stuff (and was 6-9 months away from solving an existential-risk fraud problem) was shut down. Those guys over there have too much freedom! They&#x27;re in danger of actually saving the company! Shut them down, now!<p>Of course, the health benefits were shit, which meant that days of work time were lost to haggling with insurance companies and hospitals about bills. Whatever pennies are saved by having a crappy health plan is lost when employees have to haggle on their own behalf to get health care.<p>Sometimes, cost cutting is the right way to go, but that&#x27;s rare and usually in a well-understood existential crisis. As in, &quot;this company won&#x27;t be around in two years unless we&#x27;re really tight, and here&#x27;s how we plan to make it up&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t respect companies that play against their employees. If you have a crappy health plan, a bad PTO policy, closed allocation, stack ranking, and a bad office space, then you&#x27;re not playing to win. Instead, you&#x27;re in the business of competing against your employees, when you should be in the business of excelling at something, and of winning in the market. You only get to pick one, in the long term, in this world.<p>Unfortunately, for the individual executive, the &quot;be a dick&quot; strategy often works. Most &quot;tech&quot; startups are scams: companies not built to last, but just to be sold to some &quot;greater fool&quot; before it falls to pieces on account of its own sloppy constitution. The individuals who build these crap companies generally get to cash out (or, at least, move on to cushy venture capital jobs) before that happens and, when it does, they can plausibly (if falsely) blame their successors.",1403181719

They still catch some issues though and I find it does help me sometimes compared with Ruby for example. If they only caught 2% of the issues I would be a little surprised but it is certainly in the range of possibilities depending on the stage of development (I think it would catch more as you type your code but possibly 2% or less when evaluating a finished, debugged tested product).<p>You can also add Swift to the list of languages that get it right in this regard. When receiving a return value from obj-c that can be null it comes back as an optional so you SHOULD safely transform it to a real value or only perform conditional actions on it. Of course there is the possibility to coerce it into the full type.",1403179638

7915623,comment,7914661,7915563,1,0,adwf,,,"I think I objected less to the length of the career, and more to the reason why the career is so short.  In sports, you are very physically limited, you eventually hit your physical peak and then get replaced by someone younger and faster.  The reason that the players are OK with this is because they get paid an absolute ton of money and can quite possibly retire after those 5-10 years.<p>In business this isn&#x27;t really the case.  Of course, there are a few developers who will get embedded in their particular way of thinking and may end up antiquating themselves out of a job.  But in general most people carry on learning, or promote into management or another aspect of business.<p>Essentially, there are a lot of good reasons to be treating employees like long term prospects.<p>Another one that springs to mind is the concept of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation.  We&#x27;re constantly told that people are more motivated and do better work when they are intrinsincally motivated, rather than extrinsically.  Yet, if you are treating your workers like disposable commodities; or if you as an employee are hopping from job to job every year;  Where&#x27;s the intrinsic motivation?   If you&#x27;re working at a job for 10 years or more, now I can believe that you will be motivated to see the company succeed.  That your goals and the companies goals are aligned, because a significant proportion of your life and the companies life are intertwined.<p>Just like family.<p>N.B.  Of course, if you don&#x27;t expect your startup to be around in 3 years time - whether acquired or bust - then by all means go for the sports analogy.  But I think in the wider business world, it&#x27;d be a mistake.",1403179224

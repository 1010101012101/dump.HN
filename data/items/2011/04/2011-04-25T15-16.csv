The pieces are incredibly similar to traditional chess, with slight movement variations.  We adopted the game as our 3am work-break for a while, and were able to build up a record over a few weeks.  Unlike traditional chess in which my win rate would be near-absolute, he was able to win approximately 25% of Chinese games, with his win rate stable over time as we both developed our knowledge of the nuances of the game.",1303745792

I'm sure they did that for aesthetic (decluttered front bezel) and functional (no worrying about getting schmutz in the speaker grill) reasons. But, yeah, that causes distant, disembodied sound.<p>I find my Nook Color solidly built for the price. The nice glass screen (I use an anti-glare screen protector to use it outside) is super-responsive almost to a fault. The plastic bezel is solid and finished well and doesn't seem to flex or pop when I hold it. The back plastic has a really grippy rubber coating that makes it nice to hold in one hand, as well. I think if they were to iterate, they should do away with the front plastic bezel and rock a total glass front, but I give it nice marks. I'd certainly consider paying up to 100 more for it and not be dissatisfied.<p>About rotation, I think it's Apple's use of transitional animation that makes it <i>feel</i> like it's more responsive and, thus, more ""accustomed"" to it. The NC has the same accelerometer chip as the Xoom, so I think if you perceive any lag, it could be in the redrawing of the screen.<p>That said, if you'd ever buy one, forgo all the installed software, root the device, and put a version of Cyanogenmod 7 (2.3 Gingerbread) on it.

Amazon now <i>has</i> to bring out a tablet running Android. It is only a matter of time before the NC drops to under $200 and then people start buying the NC instead of Kindle. While rooting the NC is easy, if you check the downloads of the images, I would say less than 15% end up actively rooting. So that means no Kindle app on NC.<p>2. Apple now has to figure out alternate uses for the iPad since they are going to get disrupted on the browsing/email/ebook-reader category.

The stuff I design, if I'm successful, nobody will ever notice. Things will just work, and be self-managing. Though, I've learned that some people like to configure things, so I usually design in knobs for them to play with, and perhaps improve things, but any setting of the knobs will still work correctly.<p>When engineers [who] just love this stuff design something, we wind up with a system that asks an innocent person attempting to install email, ""Do you want POP or IMAP?"" One common comment engineers make is that we need ""more user training"". That's just wrong. Instead of expecting humans to adapt to an interface slapped together by engineers, engineers should strive to create a system that is designed for humans in their natural form. """,1303743932

See if you can get your employees versed well on those finer points then they&#x27;ll be able to make better decisions (or at least, better informed ones...) so that in the longer term they will stick around instead of that they find out that they are in over their heads. I&#x27;d rather not work with someone than work with someone when I know they don&#x27;t understand the deal we are making as well as I do.<p>That attitude has saved me a lot of headaches and the only time that I deviated from it (it was pretty much a charity project anyway) I ended up in a lot of trouble over exactly that point. So, do yourself a favour and spend that extra time to educate your employees, even if it doesn&#x27;t come up about any financial package that you have agreed to (preferably before they agree to it!), in the long term that will pay back big time, and it will save both you and the people you work with a lot of grief and headaches.

Is she in high school, college, out of school? Working a basic or full-time professional job? If she has a full-time job doing something else, it&#x27;s a hell of a commitment to do something like this on an ongoing basis. I&#x27;m not sure how you could work 8+ hours a day, then come home and work on a project like this every day for 6 months straight. Even giving up more sleep than you should and any attempt to have a social life, it&#x27;d be tough to pull off.<p>It&#x27;s a little different if this is the only thing she has going on right now. Not that it isn&#x27;t still a great achievement - if I was in a position to do so, I&#x27;d be interested in hiring somebody with the intelligence, independence, and drive to complete a project like this with no definite payoff at the end. It may even be better that she can maintain a reasonable work-life balance on a long-term project and not burn out.<p>I&#x27;m working on my own project outside of work, but I sure couldn&#x27;t spend 8-ish hours on it every day over the course of 6 months while still working at my normal job.",1380477281

What he&#x27;s saying is that with a to-do list, it&#x27;s easy to just get all of the high priority stuff out of the way, and then when all you have is low priority stuff, just to dick around for the rest of the day.<p>On the one hand, there&#x27;s some validity to that point; most people can&#x27;t actually take care of every low priority item on a long term to-do list immediately without burning out. Balancing that with still taking care of the low priority items before they become crises can be difficult.<p>On the other hand, taking care of the A priorities and then ignoring the C priorities altogether is <i>simply doing it wrong</i>. The author suggests putting everything on a calendar instead of using to-do lists. I think this is dumb reasoning. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from using <i>both</i>.<p>Put everything on the to-do list. Get your high priority stuff out of the way, and then put the low priority stuff (or the stuff you have an ugh field around) on your calendar. This is way more efficient, and leverages the quickness of the to-do list to prevent you from accidentally forgetting something entirely.",1380477236

And this is with mere kilograms of equipment to process the martian atmosphere. Make no mistake, this is a big deal in a lot of different ways.<p>So that bootstraps you into being able to effectively explore Mars at all, because now you don&#x27;t have to ship out all the propellant for the return trip, which is an exponential savings.<p>Now add to that the fact that Mars has a day similar to Earth and substantial quantities of subsurface ice (and small amounts of water in the surface soil). That means you can use fairly modest capital equipment (stuff you can transport using the same vehicles you send people, and capable of being powered fairly easily) to start mining water ice within the first handful of trips to the planet. Which means that you can have local supplies of: potable water, propellant, fuel for equipment that runs on internal combustion engines, breathable oxygen, and carbon monoxide (which I&#x27;ll explain the significance of later).<p>With oxygen, abundant CO2, water, and inflatable structures you can start growing plants on Mars due to the light levels and day lengths. A colony could start supplying some of its own food within less than a decade.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more. Given the low Martian gravity it would be almost trivially easy to create an SSTO RLV that could travel back and forth between the martian surface and orbit, refueling on the surface with locally produced propellant. You could build these on Earth and send them over without crews and just enough propellant to make a powered, parachute assisted landing before being put into service. They could visit a station in Mars orbit which would make it easier to make trips back and forth to Earth.<p>Additionally, by using a cycler (a spacecraft which is on a permanent trajectory looping between Earth and Mars) you could significantly increase the amount of useful payload you could deliver to Mars and increase the comfort and safety of passengers. Although for bulk cargo you could use electric propulsion to push the cargo out of low Earth orbit over to Mars and then use aerocapture / aerobraking to bring the payloads within reach of an orbital tug at Mars that could bring it to a station where it could be ferried down to the surface.<p>Back to Martian resources. With carbon monoxide available all you need is energy in order to be able to effectively smelt metals such as iron, copper, or aluminum. Some of the rocks and regolith on Mars are effectively high grade ores, especially of iron. It would not take much equipment to be able to start producing builk amounts of steel. This could be used for all sorts of purposes in expanding a base into a full fledged settlement.<p>From there things accelerate quickly. It gets easier and easier to send things to Mars, to come back from Mars, and to build things on Mars. Capital investments on Mars start to make a huge amount of sense. A substantial power source on Mars (even just in the single megawatt range) is not merely a lifeline for a base it becomes the seed of a growing industrial base. With power and water you can process the atmosphere and bootstrap the chemical industry with all the products listed above. And with that you can smelt bulk metals, and make glass. You can also start making concrete and other building materials. You can start making buildings and farming structures where only a small fraction of the structure is composed of supplies shipped from Earth.<p>And that&#x27;s really just square 1. From there you can move on to more advanced industry, more robust farming, more advanced technology, and so on. The very first visitors to Mars will likely be scientists, but the second wave will be dominated by engineers. Imagine what will be built with the thousands of tonnes of steel, concrete, aluminum, copper, and so forth that will be produced within only the first decade of this primitive industrial capacity coming online.

It was certainly not the intent. But if I was unclear, I&#x27;ll accept responsibility for any misinterpretation that has resulted.<p>I tend to use overly elaborate sentences. Speaking more plainly and clearly would do me a lot of good. That&#x27;s a consistent problem I have on HN, and it&#x27;s my fault.<p>If I had to sum up my OP in three sentences, it would be as follows: &quot;People are smart, and they&#x27;ll figure out if you&#x27;re keeping things from them. So don&#x27;t hide things from them that affect them. That being said, it&#x27;s not necessarily your responsibility to get too far into the weeds on every last detail of how startup financing works.&quot;<p>In general, I&#x27;m in favor of transparency. I&#x27;m in favor of giving employees an honest deal. I&#x27;m in favor of treating employees as partners, not as &quot;human resources.&quot; I <i>don&#x27;t</i>, however, believe the CEO&#x27;s job is to be the parent figure of everyone in the company. And accordingly, I believe startup employees should educate themselves as much as possible about the risks involved before joining a startup. Some of those risks are outside of the CEO&#x27;s total control, in fact (e.g., Series A investors, the Board of Directors, M&A processes, etc.).<p>That&#x27;s not meant to be a cold, <i>caveat emptor</i> sort of statement. It&#x27;s just meant to be realistic. Ideally, a good CEO is transparent and honest. He or she should keep employees up to date on the company&#x27;s finances, and on how things may change if major turning points arise. A good CEO always does the right thing by his or her employees. But the employees should still do their homework. The CEO should be transparent, but the employees should still be capable of self reliance and diligence. It&#x27;s a two-way street.<p>(The article, for instance, brings up the case of an employee who&#x27;s thinking about buying a house. It&#x27;s not the CEO&#x27;s job to manage that employee&#x27;s personal finances. While she should share any pertinent facts with the employee, and perhaps offer solid advice, she&#x27;s not responsible the employee&#x27;s personal-life decisions).<p>I hope this clarifies what I was trying to say.

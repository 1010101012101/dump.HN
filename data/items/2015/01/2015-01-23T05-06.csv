PipelineDB runs SQL queries continuously on large volumes of streaming data, giving companies the capability to easily develop scalable, realtime applications and services using only a familiar SQL interface. No application code is required.<p>This inherently involves solving a lot of big problems, many of which are novel. We’re looking for creative engineers who appreciate the value and freedom of choosing their own projects, approaches, and working with other top talent in a low distraction, streamlined work environment. Our small team has backgrounds from Berkeley, MIT, Facebook, Locu and AdRoll, and we&#x27;re all doing exactly what we want to be doing: building a groundbreaking new product out of thin air.<p>We are well funded by top investors including SV Angel, Susa Ventures, Data Collective, Paul Buchheit, and more.<p>If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity like this, please send your resume and a quick blurb about yourself to jobs@pipelinedb.com.<p>About the position:<p>As an early stage engineer you&#x27;ll ultimately own a very large part of the product. Which part of the product you take charge of depends on where your interests are, but there are several different potential areas of focus. You&#x27;ll be entrusted to make sound architectural decisions as well as implement your vision effectively. We review each others&#x27; code for quality, awareness, and learning, so you&#x27;ll spend some time contributing your valuable perspective to those efforts as well, although the vast majority of your time will be spent designing and building your own projects.<p>There is also an optional opportunity to help produce technical and marketing content, speak at conferences, interact with customers, and work as a developer evangelist.<p>Requirements:<p>* Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher in CS or related field<p>* You&#x27;ve worked with large C/C++ systems in a Linux environment and are highly effective at navigating them<p>* You understand the difference between good code and correct code, and you care about testing<p>* Strong understanding of concurrency<p>* Strong system-level debugging skills--you are not intimidated by the obscurest of nondeterministic behaviors and race conditions<p>* Strong understanding of CS theory--you are able to translate theoretical concepts and academic research into practical code<p>* You have a habit of figuring out how something works before asking someone to explain it to you, regardless of how deep the rabbit hole goes<p>* Strong understanding of how performant storage systems work<p>Bonus points:<p>* Experience with/contributions to PostgreSQL, Storm, Kafka, Samza, Kinesis, or Esper<p>* Experience with database internals<p>* Experience building distributed systems<p>* Experience building realtime systems<p>Benefits:<p>* Full medical/dental/vision insurance<p>* No set work hours--work when you feel smart<p>* Choose your own setup<p>* No vacation policy other than that it is strongly encouraged<p>* Large equity ownership<p>--<p>jobs@pipelinedb.com",1421992665
8933594,comment,8931564,8933369,0,0,whatshisface,,,"There is a bit of a parable I hear told sometimes when this topic comes up: 
A man is being taught how computers work, and is presented with the design of an adder in the form of a few Boolean logic expressions. Thinking back to the true &quot;reality&quot; of addition, he rejects the design of the adder on the grounds that nand gates have no apparent connection to the sensible reality of having 5 apples and 3 oranges and 8 fruits.<p>This would be considered a ridiculous objection in every field but physics, where misunderstandings following from it have become the basis of many bestsellers. For some reason, we consider the math involved in physics to be exempt from the otherwise universal sense of abstraction that all the other fields enjoy. We don&#x27;t go looking for tiny calculators in bacteria capable of plotting out exponential population growth, so why should the weirdness of quantum math cause so much trouble?",1421992655

I said so here when they were worth over twice what they are now.  If there is any sign of a bubble in tech, it would be Bitcoin market cap.

Or gold.  Some say it can transfer money, but so can wire transfers.  Perhaps it is decentralized (who cares?  Not I.

Sorry, I don&#x27;t have a citation, but I do remember some commentary about this by Stephen Jay Gould.  It should be pretty clear to anyone following embryology that a lot of really ancient genes are still present in modern animals, waiting to be re-awakened when the time is right.<p>It is possible that some evolutionary paths are unlikely to be trod more than once by the same organism, but it hardly seems worthy of being called a &quot;law.&quot;  Around the turn of the 20th century there was a lot of confusion and people still proposing non-Darwinian explanations of biology, so I&#x27;d be suspicious that this was just another example of that.",1421989755

But that the tide is now growing so strong, and the terrorists much more wise after the Snowden leaks, that it is basically inevitable now that the UK itself will be attacked. The terror plot/arrests in Belgium recently were also guided by UK intelligence, he said.<p>Whenever you see &quot;terror arrests made during dawn raid&quot; on the news in UK, it&#x27;s easy to dismiss it. But it happens pretty much every month now, and has been like that for a couple years now. Every one of these raids is potentially to stop a major terror attack; but the public is never told of the exact details of what they were plotting because otherwise that would defeat the purpose of averting a terror attack.",1421989617

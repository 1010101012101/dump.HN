10693751,comment,10684262,10692928,0,0,wpietri,,,"It&#x27;s an interesting point, although I think it&#x27;s worth distinguishing 4 kinds of prejudice: pro- and anti- male and female.<p>I&#x27;m interested in decreasing total prejudice, and also decreasing the substantial imbalance in net prejudice benefit between groups. I don&#x27;t think prejudice can be eliminated; System 1 thinking is too practically useful.<p>I think the reason people react negatively to dudes bringing up a possible increase in anti-male prejudice is that that it&#x27;s usually brought up as an interruption to discussion of anti-female prejudice. That is, it&#x27;s not used as a serious participation in a broad discussion of prejudice and how to reduce it, but a way of derailing discussion. And as I said, people are inclined to treat a reduction in pro-them prejudice as an increase in anti-them prejudice. So even sincere attempts can come across as ignorant.<p>Personally, I suspect anti-male prejudice is actually decreasing as we unwind patriarchy. I think it can be more visible, though, as a) women are more willing to be open about anti-male prejudices they have, and b) as we see women moving toward equality, we reexamine our own position. But I&#x27;m personally ok even if it&#x27;s a temporary increase, as I see it as a backlash against the status quo. Honestly, given the number of women I know who have been sexually assaulted or physically abused, I&#x27;m amazed there isn&#x27;t more anti-male prejudice. As we reduce the number of people who have those experiences, I expect we&#x27;ll see dramatic drops in anti-male prejudice.",1449532580

The hard part is figuring out how to negotiate with thousands of separate tiny &quot;open-source&quot; components, without project leaders making demands too ridiculous.<p>At the same time, we don&#x27;t really want a race-to-the-bottom of poorly-maintained software projects just because someone figured reimplementation could net him a bunch of revenue if he prices everything lower... presumably this cuts into long-term software maintenance, which is something that a good system would ideally incentivize both from the perspective of library authors but also from the perspective of software purchasers, who don&#x27;t want to suffer from bitrot.<p>(Another approach could be &quot;performance targets&quot; where bonds are created by library authors, but funded by company purchasers, who would be buying up some amount of technical debt in exchange for rights to deploy and use the software in their production environments. These bonds would then pay out to the library author team based on milestones, like long-term maintenance, or fixing scaling bugs, or something... But similar problems remain regarding how to handle the negotiation between thousands of tiny library authors vs companies that don&#x27;t have 1000s of hours to waste on software negotiation..... Also lots of questions about &quot;rebundling&quot;- we can&#x27;t have negotiations with all 100k library authors between themselves and some company just to strike a deal for the company to use an Ubuntu-like software system.

I&#x27;ve been reading HN frequently for the past few years, and a recurring theme I noticed was frustration regarding email (intriguingly, it&#x27;s only the people on HN who seem to dislike email; everyone else seems to universally adore it). So at the start of this year I decided to fix email by creating a new protocol that overcomes some of email&#x27;s shortcomings while remaining backwards-compatible with email. Anything short of a new protocol struck me as lipstick on a pig, and anything that failed to maintain compatibility with email struck me as Google Wave.<p>This repository contains a full-stack implementation of the new protocol, so you can clone the repository, start up a vagrant machine and immediately connect via your web browser to try it out (though if you actually want to use it for sending and receiving emails, you won&#x27;t get far by running it on a network with port 22 blocked). At the moment I don&#x27;t have instructions for setting it up outside of Vagrant, but I&#x27;m also not sure how many people would actually be interested in running it themselves in a production environment. It&#x27;s still quite rough around the edges, so it&#x27;s not quite production-ready anyway, but most of the roughness is in the UI and edge cases in protocol handling which I&#x27;ve worked out logically but haven&#x27;t yet implemented.<p>Protocol ambitions aside, I wanted to learn a lot from this experience--previously I had done some PHP and WordPress development, and I just wanted to try using Node and React to mash a Trello-like app together with email somehow, and things started happening so fast... Mainly I wanted to see how far I could go with one of my &quot;crazy&quot; ideas, because up until now I had always assumed that there would have to be something besides running out of time and money that would fundamentally stop me. Among the many things I learned, I discovered that it really does just boil down to the time and money! :) So now I&#x27;m looking for work.<p>That said, I <i>am</i> planning to continue development on this for my personal use (and possible work use later), so I&#x27;m open to suggestions, feedback, pull requests.... I know an open demo would be the bees knees. I&#x27;m planning to make such a demo in the near future, but for announcing this I did not want to. If you&#x27;re interested in trying it out in a live environment rather than in Vagrant, I&#x27;m running this stack on zombition.com, and you can contact me at &quot;tom&quot; at the aforementioned domain for an invitation.

These periodic orbits, referred to as &quot;halo&quot; orbits, do not exist in a full n-body dynamical system such as the Solar System. However, quasi-periodic (i.e. bounded but not precisely repeating) orbits following Lissajous-curve trajectories do exist in the n-body system. These quasi-periodic Lissajous orbits are what most of Lagrangian-point missions to date have used. Although they are not perfectly stable, a relatively modest effort at station keeping can allow a spacecraft to stay in a desired Lissajous orbit for an extended period of time. It also turns out that, at least in the case of Sun–Earth-L1 missions, it is actually preferable to place the spacecraft in a large-amplitude (100,000–200,000 km or 62,000–124,000 mi) Lissajous orbit, instead of having it sit at the Lagrangian point, because this keeps the spacecraft off the direct line between Sun and Earth, thereby reducing the impact of solar interference on Earth–spacecraft communications. Similarly, a large-amplitude Lissajous orbit around L2 can keep a probe out of Earth&#x27;s shadow and therefore ensures a better illumination of its solar panels.&quot;",1449529685

The benefit of strict static typing is not so much that it allows a compiler to produce fast code -- there are lots of ways to achieve that. The benefit is that by forcing the programmer to type out the type signatures of functions in advance, you force a level of thought clarity and appreciation for the way that different pieces of code have to pass off data or state to other parts. I find it leads to better software not because of the compiler (although a compiler catching your mistakes is great for productivity), but because it makes you think much more clearly.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like the habit of writing down your moves in chess. The benefit is that it creates a ritual of thought and reflection, and potentially makes you more careful.<p>These days, I see code with enforced type declarations and typed signatures as so much more elegant than similar code that, while having fewer characters, conveys significantly less about the programming intention. Those extra characters for type info are not clutter, not by a long shot.",1449529361

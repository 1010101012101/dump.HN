Cofoundr exists, and News.YC exists, but have you ever wondered why people still complain about finding cofounders? Obviously, the problem still exists.<p>Some thoughts:<p>- Instead of a demo day in your area, build a site where its easy for hackers to upload their Web apps and show them off to all the other users. You pay for the hosting and handle all the tedious server stuff, and I simply upload my code, click ""Go"", and the app goes live for a day or two. Users can upvote the projects that they think are the coolest, and hackers accumulate popularity points.<p>- Maintain a ""Top-List"" of ""best entrepreneurs"", ranked by the number of votes that each person gets on Demo Days. Perhaps categorize this by the type of product each entrepreneur is interested in building. So if there is a Top 10 list for entrepreneurs building stuff that has something to do with mobile software, and I'm #2 on the list and you are #1, hey that looks like a promising team. At least, it's better than going blindly. <p>- In addition to the Demo Day software, build a Web app that makes it easy for entrepreneurs/programmers to keep track of their hobby projects online and constantly display them to the world for everyone to see. Imagine a place where thousands of hackers all have their hobby stuff online. So I do a search for ""mobile software"" on the site, and I find 10 people that did some hacks for fun and are showing off their work. If I'm looking for a cofounder, I would contact the person who I thought had the best work.<p>Maybe the 3 things I listed here are crap, but my point is that you should constantly reiterate on a seemingly ""dumb idea"" because eventually it might turn into a winner.\n",1194584331

77802,comment,77764,77801,0,0,rms,,,">I was thinking about movies and realized that one way to stop pirates is to leapfrog a generation of HD quality.<p>That would definitely do it to a certain extent, but the vast majority of people right now aren't interested in super-HD. HD media is catching on slowly enough because most people don't seem to care about the difference between HD-DVD and DVD.<p>It couldn't stop piracy, it would just end up differentiating based on whether or not people thought 1.4 gig .avi's are good enough.",1194581957
77801,comment,77764,77799,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I'm not sure pirates are that flexible, but I agree circumnavigation is trivial. I think lots of people are pirates mainly out of convenience. If decrypting were harder than unzipping, people might not use it.<p>I was thinking about movies and realized that one way to stop pirates is to leapfrog a generation of HD quality. If movies were 3600x2400, even with h264 they would take eons to download. Also, they would take a great deal of time to recompress [compression is much more cpu intensive than decompression]. This makes the amateur pirate's life harder. There would be a reason to buy/rent the disk. Avoiding piracy through innovation ... what a thought.\n",1194581731

To combat the gridlock, some cities are investing in new ways to move residents from point A to point B. Since taking office in 2008, Salt Lake Citys Democratic Mayor Ralph Becker has helped push for greater transit options in his city. As a result, a major expansion of the areas light rail system, as well as the introduction of streetcars to the city, are currently underway. He recently talked to U.S. News about why his city has invested so heavily in improving transit, and what a successful public transportation system looks like.Our entrepreneurial approach to developing transit and the cooperative approach weve had for transit development has enabled an enormous leapfrogging kind of development of transit. Some of it is the way our transit agency is set up. [The Utah Transit Authority is] a statewide agency that local governments opt into, with a sales tax option. It is the taxpayers, the voters, who vote on that contribution to transit, and as weve developed light rail, which really is now only 11 years old, people have seen how much they like it and want to use it and use it far beyond projections. Theyve been willing to go to the voting booths and increase taxes on themselves continue",1342421104

But I also had absolutely no social life and was terribly overweight/out of shape.\nI still code in my free time (in fact, I spent much of today playing with Scala and LWJGL), but I make a conscious effort to head out and interact with the world (in as nerdy of a way as possible of course, I have a FuelBand which forces me to go out and be active to keep my streak up).\nI love coding (both at work and for fun) and would still do it all day every day if I could, but I found my quality of life increased by leaps and bounds as I picked up the slack elsewhere (not just in fitness, but mentally as well. Especially walking around, hiking, exercise, &c helps clear my mind and refocus). Maybe you're not as totally lost as I was, but until technology advances enough for me to exist as a brain in a vat, I have actually found it very important to get away and engage tertiary faculties not directly related to the generation of sourcecode.\nAnd I'm never too far away from my projects anyway. I tend to have a chromebook/tablet/phone with me running an ssh client and a tmux session always running on my raspberry pi, but typically forget about it entirely unless I have a sudden epiphany).",1342419833

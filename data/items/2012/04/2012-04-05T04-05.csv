Are they in a phase that's more ideation? Are they refining in their design funnel? I think it's a bit curious to point at an example of a product by one company and say essentially 'They did it this way and were successful, clearly this is how all things should be designed'.<p>I'm not sure this is an issue of them asking a question analagous to ""What do you want the iPhone to do?"" so much as it's maybe ""How annoying are people who aren't researchers and designers going to find wearing HUD glasses for 3 hours a day?"" or ""Will people feel uncomfortable using them in pedestrian or cycling settings given that they're voice-activated and pervasive?"" Granted, there are maybe analogous products on the market that will maybe inform how people will interact with this new medium, but I have a few years experience interacting with someone using this sort of one-eyed projective displays (my former research advisor wore one) and there are some funny things involved with face to face interaction with someone using them that you might not anticipate. In fact, he felt that the eyepiece was often enough of a social interaction barrier that he'd take his off and tuck it into his shirt pocket when he was having a conversation.<p>You're not necessarily going to figure these things out in the product design lab.

It merely means that the Judge made the right call because the law or legal statute was written by an idiot.  It's significantly different from NYS' Amazon law that it takes an indefensible position.<p>Sales tax under Quill v North Dakota has always stated that SALES TAX specifically and not income/franchise tax has a physical presence requirement.  Colorado was stupid because they specifically call out non-resident/companies without a physical presence to comply with a series of demands (reporting, notices and etc) that cost crap tons of money.  There's an obvious undue hardship here.<p>The interesting thing is that NYS' position was much smarter they used the affiliate nexus rules.  Instead of going after Amazon directly, they simply stated that Amazon had a physical presence in NYS due to the affiliate marketers in the state.  The number of affiliates substantiates a ""nexus or connection"" within the state to require sales tax.  This absolutely works!<p>Don't get your panties in a bunch because this aint over by a long shot.

Perl was invented because C + Unix text processing utilities together were not proving to be good for many tasks like Text processing, fast prototyping etc. Now using another C based language which doesn't do that, takes us back to the old problem again.<p>IMO, Python doesn't solve those problems. Regex support is really bad in Python and file operations are not trivial. There is too much of Java feel to it and it just doesn't have the feel of bash/perl/awk's scripting powers. Scoping is just not right. There doesn't seem to be a sane ways of evolution without breaking backwards compatibility. No equivalent of CPAN. And in many ways white space based parsing is not good for large and nested code blocks. It still doesn't have multiline lambda's. And its too much do-it-one-true-way kind of language, that sort of is a blocker for quick hacking. Because I like to write what I think, and not the other way around. The language is too verbose, and unlike Perl and Emacs there are no exponential productivity gains over time.<p>But I agree though, that Python does have some other good things.

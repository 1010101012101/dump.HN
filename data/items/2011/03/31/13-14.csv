He said that way, the rest of us could pay attention :)  He would stand at the front and ramble about whatever came to mind, and scribble on an overhead transparency. He would start with a topic and take it wherever we asked: multiple dimensions, knot-tying, origami, computational geometry, ray-tracing. The course was called ""3D Math"" or something, so everything was relevant :) There were no tests, and we got to choose our own final projects. The notes and overheads were duplicated as study guides for the final, and the questions were taken right out of them.

Don't point it at the sail though - just point it away from the boat. :)<p>But anyway the difference here is that the ""wind"" is not being ""pulled"" from external sources (like real wind), it's <i>created</i> by Pioneer. And that makes a huge difference.<p>With wind, the fan pulls the wind (which creates force), and also pushes the wind (which also creates force).<p>Next you impact the wind into the sail, which subtracts from our force (since the wind is pushing in the wrong direction).<p>And finally the wind ""bounces"" off the sail, also subtracting, and leaving you with no net force.<p>i.e. +2 then -2.<p>With pioneer one step is missing - the force from pulling the wind (since the photons are created on the fly). So you have +1 then -2, leaving you with a net force of -1.<p>PS. If you don't understand why pulling and pushing the wind counts as two forces, think of a compressor which sucks in air and stores it. It still causes motion by pulling the air, but it doesn't push it.",1301579249

A common pattern found in digital cameras is four sensors in a square grid, red/green/blue/green.

2391480,comment,2390801,2391250,4,0,btilly,,,"<i>Going back to that point, the IMO is like playing at Carnegie Hall. What we want is like messing about with instruments to see what they do, and getting hooked on the curious things that are possible.</i><p>I'm torn on this.<p>I personally got hooked on math while trying to figure out the probability of getting various scores after rolling 5 dice and taking the sum of the top 3.  (I wound up suggesting this as a Project Euler problem - <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=24...</a> was the result.)  So I know full well the value of messing around.<p>However I wouldn't trust the educational establishment with a task like this.  Right now we're caught in a tension between opposing groups.  One is apt to recite <i>drill and kill</i> and <i>learning to learn</i> and then proceed to avoiding teaching things that they think are too hard.  (Which is apparently everything.)  The other is fond of standardized testing at every opportunity as a way to force the first group to actually teach something.  (Usually with pretty ridiculous tests.)  At the moment in the USA, the testers have the upper hand.  But if history is an indication, this won't last forever.<p>I would trust neither group with what you are trying to do.  The first group would be quick to agree with you, grab a slogan, and then head off to do the wrong thing.  The latter group would not see the point, and would either start talking about the 3 Rs, or would add to their tests some random, out of context, facts.<p>I'm not just saying this out of pessimism.  We've seen this particular movie before in the <i>New Math</i> movement.  Early experiments, with actual mathematicians involved, went well.  The mathematicians presented interesting material, and kids enjoyed it.  But when the educational establishment tried to imitate that success and get not particularly mathematically inclined teachers to repeat that, it was a disaster.  (I was after the main movement, but there was still some of it going on.  And I experienced first hand how bad it was when a teacher who didn't understand the material taught his misunderstandings rather than the material.)  In the end outraged parents forced teachers back to the 3 Rs, and New Math became nothing more than a bad memory.<p>I would highly recommend studying that particular episode with the goal of figuring out what went wrong, where.  Because what you would like to do has the potential to do the same thing.",1301578876

Seriously: if Apple isn't putting some seeming obvious feature into a phone, or computer, or whatever, I figure that there's probably some good reason for that.  I'm not sufficiently interested to need to understand the minute details of every choice they make.<p>LTE is a perfect example. I don't give a damn whether my next phone has LTE.  I have better things to do with my time than figure out whether the coverage — independent of carriers' marketing claims — is decent, make guesses — independent of etc. etc. — as to the extent of the coverage rollout over the next year, read up on the battery-life implications of LTE, and ponder whether the bottleneck on my phone has anything to do with the network speed in the first place.<p>(Actually, I already have a very strong suspicion about where the bottleneck is on my phone, and that's why I <i>really</i> don't care about LTE right now.)<p>Overall, I <i>trust</i> Apple to sell me the best all-round phone given the constraints of current technology. So far I've been very happy with that approach.  So, yes, if Apple isn't putting some seeming obvious feature in a phone, I figure that there's probably a good reason for it, a reason that I'd understand and possibly even agree with if I invested a lot of time in the question.<p>The risk is that, should Apple go rogue, they could rip me off for an iteration or two before I wised up.  In which case I would just go <i>buy another phone</i> from someone else and be done with it.<p>It's not like I'm blindly trusting Apple to not, say, saw off my leg and feed it to alligators; I'm trusting them to make decisions about a whole bunch of tradeoffs, decisions that will at best be valid only for a few months anyway, decisions on which hinge the expenditure of a few hundred dollars.<p>I'm not saying that becoming a micro-expert on your purchases is <i>wrong</i>, just that there's something to be said for not bothering.  This is very much not the Nerd Way, but I have to say that I'm much happier since I stopped having to personally establish the perfect correctness of all my techno-purchasing decisions.",1301578812

He asked a one-sentence question on a listserv forum about whether anyone else had had a bad experience with the firm. One person forwarded the question to his spouse and the spouse forwarded it to the firm whose services were being questioned. The lawyer then went to the U.S. Copyright Office and, believe it or not, registered his one-sentence inquiry as a copyright and then sued the parties who had forwarded it for infringement!<p>For those interested (and I realize this is not a matter of general interest):<p>1. The case documents the absurd lengths to which some people, and especially a certain type of lawyer, will go to bully and intimidate through litigation.<p>2.

The judge has some priceless jabs in the decision, e.g., footnote 7, where she considered the lawyer's point whether a one-sentence line from Shakespeare (""to be or not to be"", from Hamlet) might have been copyrightable and retorted that the better inquiry here might have been about <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>.<p>The patient will be well rewarded in reading through this one (you can skip or skim past parts that are not of general interest, e.g., the legal standard for summary judgment).<p>Bottom line: after 2 years of very expensive litigation, the offending lawyer is about to get socked with a massive attorney fee award that the judge already decided he will pay ""for pursuing such folderol,"" leaving only the amount to be determined.",1301578753

It's not as ridiculously short, but it's much more polished, and the added bulk is universally useful.<p>I hadn't seen their indigenous templating system before -- it looks pretty slow, though not as dog-slow as Genshi.",1227430219
373626,comment,373292,373501,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I mean, traditional news outlets like CNN and New York Times have not significantly changed the way they deliver news online compared to newspapers or television. And I think there's a lot of room for innovation.<p>Except for CNN, no one has really begun to embrace the immediacy of the internet. And even CNN has done a very poor job; it takes them an hour or more to post breaking news on CNN.com sometimes.",1227429664

I've never found any publishings as to the results -- have they actually done <i>anything</i> with the returned text?<p>CAPTCHAs themselves are rarely the best option -- they're only useful for unauthenticated submissions to extremely prominent sites (Google Accounts, Craigslist) and to extremely popular/poorly-written software (Movable Type, Wordpress).<p>If I'm already authenticated, or if I'm authenticating from a high-value OpenID provider (Google, etc.) I should not be solving any goddamn CAPTCHAs. If I'm anonymous (or effectively so with an unknown OpenID provider) it's ok to CAPTCHA me, but before you implement them think first about whether anyone's actually going to <i>ATTACK YOU WITH A BOTNET</i>. Unless you're a high-value target for griefing, the only way that's going to happen is if your site is an identical clone in a decrepit monoculture.",1227428384

All unimportant emails get archived instantly.  This keeps my inbox empty and my mind at ease.<p>If I'm bored, I'll read the unimportant emails.<p>This system is simple and makes life a little less complicated.",1227427651

Allow people to send you what I call a PEmail. This is an email with a very specific project outlined. Instead of just a subject line, the PEmail has a subject line for the project's name and a time due line. Your email client then automatically organizes the incoming PEmails by when the project is due.",1227427513

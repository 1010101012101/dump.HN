I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;industry-oriented programs&quot; even means, but assuming you actually meant &quot;FP doesn&#x27;t have widespread use in the industry&quot;, I&#x27;d say that while this is true, a- it&#x27;s becoming less true every day, through the use of mixed-paradigm languages, and b- even the purer FP languages see industry use.<p>&quot;Right or wrong&quot; this current reality you mentioned is shifting. Hybrid languages are becoming more common. Traditional languages are adopting functional idioms (and idioms from other paradigms as well!). It&#x27;s not true that there is a clear-cut &quot;natural&quot; kind of programs for which to use FP; the area for which FP is good is pretty much good old &quot;let&#x27;s write software that works and has few bugs&quot;.

Even if you don&#x27;t stumble, it&#x27;s hard to compete with Google and Apple at this point, because they have their services tightly tied in with their other products.  Buy an iPhone (hell, or even a laptop or tablet), and Apple Music is integrated out of the box.  Same with Google Music.<p>Personally I think Spotify is doomed to fail (for various definitions of &quot;fail&quot;) for the same reason.

Surely there are plenty of people that would love to be paid for that job, but we have all these smug elitist volunteers doing the jobs for free.<p>This comparison is inaccurate – soup kitchen volunteers are not performing a <i>complete job which is being bid for</i>. This underbid is more analogous to if a local government center asking for bids to serve a meeting of 500 people, and a local soup kitchen bidding $1 for the contract because they are essentially giving away free food. They then end up supplying the meeting with 500 bowls of great chili, and everyone is happy.<p>If the soup kitchen started doing this every time the government center issued a bid, the local restaurants would never make any money <i>from the government center</i>. This is not to say that they would never make money. But it is legitimate for an average restaurant in the area to be worried by the soup kitchen&#x27;s actions, and view it as a potential devaluer of their product.",1447710959

Possibly because I&#x27;m <i>not</i> naturally good at this, so I have to do it consciously.<p>The way in for me was English literature. Since the modern novel, writing in English focuses on revealing character through what someone does or says. Why do they choose this word and not another? By their actions, what can you learn about what&#x27;s going on in their head?<p>Turns out that works pretty well in real life too.<p>A trivial example: I had a supervisor who I would say had problems with role-reversing. While ostensibly the boss, this person really wanted other people to notice what a difficult time they were having. Again I figured this out just through word choice. Some people, in the boss role, express their vision as &quot;we need to do this&quot;; with this boss it was more like &quot;nobody is supporting me, so you all need to step up&quot;. Instead of performing confidence, they performed their personal discomfort, which is a cry for others to show that they care.<p>I think most people would realize that this is <i>annoying</i>, but look a little deeper, to see the need that&#x27;s behind that. This is someone who habitually fears abandonment. (Maybe that&#x27;s even why they took the boss role.)<p>So, all it took was a tiny comment every now and then from me, to allay their fears, and our relationship dramatically shifted for the better.<p>Now, this kind of personal attention can be just kindness. You can use it to give people around you the motivation they need to succeed. But in this case, the neediness was sort of a bottomless pit, so it made me seriously question ever working with this person again.<p>Most people are broadcasting all kinds of things about themselves, almost painfully strongly. It&#x27;s just that for the most part, nobody is picking up on it. Developers in particular usually don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to pick up on it.",1447710949

Zenefits functions on a “hub-and-spoke” model… they’re the hub, we’re the spokes.  But that&#x27;s already an outdated functionality-- there should be no spokes when it comes to payroll and benefits—they are really just one single hub functioning in unison. Removing the spokes and human operations that Zenefits uses removes the opportunity for error.<p>2) We’re a customer service organization, not a sales organization.  With the technology comes the vital human touch—you’ve got your dedicated Care Team trained to support your benefits just like you have a Care Team trained to support specific payroll needs.You also have your dedicated and experienced Benefits Advisor for business and benefits strategy planning.  This way, you can go to one partner for all your back-office needs rather than using an intermediary to control several different disjointed resources.<p>3) Because it’s all in one place, you get one beautifully simple experience for your entire team—administrators/managers and regular employees.  That means onboarding your employees&#x27; payroll and benefits in one place while we help you navigate the confusing world that is US Health Care Reform.  \nBasically, we love you as a customer and we want the best product experience for you.  That happens when you use the full Gusto platform to combine payroll, benefits, and compliance.</i><p>It wasn&#x27;t very convincing to me, and I think it might be an even harder sell now that Zenefits is launching payroll.

10577464,comment,10574061,10577335,0,0,vegabook,,,"Here is the perfect opportunity to clarify a misconception.<p>Swaps != debt.<p>Swaps do not create a liability/asset <i>unless interest rates move</i>, and even so, most of the swap contracts will then nullify one another.<p>Most banks admittedly have trillions of notional swaps on their books. The very vast majority of these offset each other. The &quot;open position&quot; (net exposure) in banks is very heavily monitored by the authorities. Banks are not heavily exposed.<p>Arguably, corporates (who hedge) and insurance companies or pension funds DO have open positions in swaps. But even so, recall that the potential liability is proportional to the likelihood of an interest rate move. Let&#x27;s say an open position of 1 trillion (enormous) receiver swaps (lent) sees a 3% upmove in 5y interest rates on an average 5y maturity of the book (usually lower). Assuming rates near zero which they are, the duration calculation means a net debt becomes payable by such company of 3x5% = 15% of the notional = 150 billion USD. So 1 trillion became 150 billion, even under an extreme scenario. 1/6th. Then recall, that rates will never move 3% (300bps) in one line. They&#x27;ll move a few bps every day. It&#x27;ll be very clear once the liability hits, say 5-10 billion, that the counterparty cannot pay anymore, they will be made bankrupt (or close these positions) well before 3% (remember daily margining?), and the swap contracts will become null and void immediately. So now 1 trillion of swap contracts became 5-10 billion realizable debts.<p>By contrast, when the Treasury borrows 1 trillion, they owe a full trillion, no matter what happens in interest rates. See the difference?<p>Now in this analysis, I&#x27;m glossing over counterparty risk in swaps. Banks &quot;not heavily exposed&quot; relies on the idea that all banks are good for their commitments, since their netting is done against other banks. This is not the case in a Lehman style scenario(it&#x27;s like a huge web that even neo4j would have trouble monitoring - ha ha - if a piece of the web falls away, many banks are then potentially exposed). Hence the major focus of all policy makers in the past several years has been to make derivative clearing daily-marginable, and exchange cleared. To erase that problem (outside of 6-sigma &quot;impossible&quot; etc - see one of my other posts)<p>Further to that policy maker regulation, did you know that in the latest European banking sector rules, derivative contract commitments are senior <i>even to small depositors</i>? So equity goes first, then subordinated (higher yield) debt, then depositors > 100k, then senior debt, then depositors < 100k, and <i>only then</i>, swap liabilities.<p>Of course, lawyers sit even above swaps ;-)",1447710426

Given the widespread use of KD in the treatment of obesity and the role of NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance in promoting type 2 diabetes, these results may have important clinical implications, as obese patients on such diets could lose weight but develop NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980360/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980360/</a>",1447710127

The challenge (and most of the point) is to remove the negative bias both teachers and children have against being &quot;behind&quot; by one or more grades.<p>Reversion to the mean happens. Ability to do e.g. most kinds of arithmetic eventually arrives in everybody by the time they&#x27;re 13 or so, yet we say the kids who can multiply at 6 are &quot;gifted&quot; and the ones who can&#x27;t until 13 are &quot;disabled&quot;.

The first degree of the Taylor-series of solutions probably looks like figuring out each child&#x27;s &quot;average&quot; developmental age, and trying to start kids in school so that everyone in grade 1 has the same development level, rather than the same age. The second degree would probably involve separating school into &quot;subjects&quot; at a much earlier level, such that a child could be placed in grade 3 math but grade 1 reading, rather than ending up frustrated in a totally-grade-1 or totally-grade-3 classroom.<p>(The <i>analytical</i> solution is likely something like a &quot;flipped classroom&quot; MOOC+Montessori model, where recorded lectures are taken in at home, while school is effectively a huge library full of tutors and labs and self-testing apparatuses, with a micro-skill &quot;tech-tree&quot; being filled in by each test, and procedurally-generated tests being able to be repeated until each micro-skill can be achieved at 100% fluency.

If you don&#x27;t know, you can&#x27;t easily contract out the choice either, how do you know the contractor can or will make a good choice for you?<p>So the best outcome for non-technical organizations is to get lucky and know someone personally who knows what they&#x27;re doing and has no ulterior motive - someone just like you. They don&#x27;t really know if they know such a person. But if they get lucky and pick just the right helpful competent person to make IT decisions for them, modern technology can give them quite a lot for very little.<p>It&#x27;s a perplexing situation.",1447707916

The interview <i>is</i> mostly pg talking, or was for us, with some interjections by rtm because we work on systems issues where he had more experience, but that&#x27;s not the whole picture, at all.<p>She is not a silent Oracle, she just isn&#x27;t particularly outgoing when it comes to press and such, and so she is not seen when looking in from the outside. She is extremely friendly, entirely sincere, and not at all judgmental (unless, of course, there is something negative to judge...character of founders does matter, and if pg has noticed Jessica has better skills in judging character it would be silly to ignore her opinion). pg and the boys seem imminently capable of spotting technical fakery, but maybe are weaker at spotting character fakery.

Hash join code is here [1], and it uses ES&#x27; scrolling feature to incrementally join, though it&#x27;s not pipelined.

It puts Washington Square Park , which southern end should be 4th street, as 6th street, and on the northern end of the grid, George Washington Bridge, which comes into Manhattan at 175th (I believe), is marked at 180/181st.<p>This is a really cool map, but some minor adjustments and testing to get the correct fit in Manhattan first would make a notable improvement in the overall product. I'd say fitting goals would be Houston as 1st street, and maybe 191st-200s area for north bound (Bronx continues the pattern, but it's much less consistent). Good work!",1321455502

3243287,comment,3243139,3243139,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"This review is a good example of the strange willingness to ignore the fact that the iPhone and iPad are ""convergence devices"".<p>The original iPod was held up as a great design because it did one thing and did it well. The iPhone at the time of introduction did 3 things poorly (phone, iPod, browser) but succeeded because it was a good trade-off. You were going to buy a phone anyway, probably an iPod too. If you could pay a small extra fee and get a passable mobile web browser and only have to carry one device then that was a good deal.<p>However the cognitive dissonance remains in the Apple community where compromise is never supposed to be good enough. So the Kindle Fire can be a ""fail"" because it's not as good an e-reader as e-ink devices. Guess what, neither is the iPad, just like the iPhone is still not a better phone than some disposable handset with a months standby. Nor is the iPad as mobile or as cheap as an e-ink reader <i>but</i> as an overall package it's pretty neat, particularly if you watch a lot of video and surf the web for entertainment and want to play Angry Birds. And so is the kindle Fire, just scoring a bit more highly on mobile and cheap and losing out on some other things.<p>It's just plain weird to worship one set of engineering trade-offs as perfection and ruthlessly attack another set of tradeoffs that, in the big picture, are so similar as to be indistinguishable to most normal people.",1321455434

The counting arguments in the article lead us to conclude that the uniform probability of U is very close to 1, i.e. almost all permuations have never been obtained by a human shuffle.

The primary key on the relationship model is a composite primary key of two other models.
When I add a new relationship model to the @OneToMany set on one of the first models, can I get the relationship model's key to change automatically, or do I have to do it manually?<p>e.g. with three models like (psuedo-Java-Scala coming up)<p><pre><code>    class Order(val customerName)
        @OneToMany
        Set<OrderItem> items;
    class Item(itemDescription)

    order.save(); // This saves oi, but with a null value for order_id
    oi.order = order; //This seems redundant, but the save is wrong without it.

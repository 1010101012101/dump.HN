Given the direction SaaS is going, into massively centralized clouds, this shouldn't surprise anyone at all.<p>It doesn't feel like Microsoft is being predatory here, I'd say this is simply an instance of a larger market force acting on everyone in the space. A vendor who makes a hosted software solution is either going to host it themselves in a ginormous and expensive cloud or host it in a cloud utility like Amazon or Google. There simply isn't extra fat in the ""supply chain"" to support an intermediary host.<p>This explains why Microsoft's own solution is cheaper and better. It has to be. My conjecture is that the only reason it has taken so long to be cheaper and better is because of internal politics over hosting their own Office competing with desktop license revenues.",1312811655

Different stuff works for different people.<p>The yellow highlighter thing tends to make people like us wanna hurl it triggers immediate distrust. Meanwhile, information marketers still find that it works.<p>You can't know who a person is when you split-test against them.<p>More importantly, you need a LOT of traffic, and even minor temporary changes in traffic composition can affect the quality of your data.<p>You will see that traffic from HN responds to & converts very differently than traffic from Lifehacker, and again different from Small Biz Trends. Initially you may find certain changes increase your conversion rates and two months later you find you have lost almost all those customers, or that a disproportionate amount of them have asked for refunds, or been shitty to you in the support channels. Net result: a loss, which you only found out about months after you were so confident that your testing showed a gain. Would the other half of the split test do better? You can never know, because you cannot replicate the exact scenario ever again.<p>Traffic is not created equal; traffic is made up of different individuals. You can only ever get a feeling of what works for some of them some of the time, depending on several factors.<p>Take the yellow-highlighter example again: Why does it work for infomarketers when it makes people like us flee in the other direction? They sell to different people. Why would the Hacker News crowd be worse customers than the Lifehacker crowd? Because they are different types of people.<p>Unless you run a months-long test covering all parts of your business (refunds, avg turnover rate, length of customer stay, # of support inquiries/nastiness in support inquiries, resource usage, server bills, etc), tho, split-testing can't tell you which types of people are better for you.<p>And if you DO do that, when exactly will you have time left to expand and market your product?<p>I'm not saying split-testing is wrong or useless, but people use it to try to create scientific certainty when it's absolutely NOT possible to do so.",1312810314

Apple basically showed everyone else how to do it[1]. I've read that trying to launch an app on a platform like Symbian in the ""old"" days was an utter nightmare. You would have to deal with carriers and try to convince them to approve your app in some cases.<p>iPhone development was my first ""proper"" job after finishing a masters degree.

The company I work for is doing some pretty cool stuff with apps, I hope to be able to talk about a project we've going on here on HN in a few months.<p>I hear what you're saying about net zero gain from a few technology displacing old jobs. I think that's just a short-term phenomenon. If apps displace some jobs in more traditional industries (e.g. the apps in my company aim to replace paper-based product catalogs with iOS/Android apps that do the same thing, except faster, better, cheaper) then I think:<p>a) more jobs will be created in the app development space<p>b) the productivity gains, cost savings and perhaps new market opportunities offered by apps will allow the beneficiary company to become more profitable, leading to job growth in that company. This has a knock-on effect also for those who deal with the beneficiary company (e.g. suppliers getting more business, customers getting better prices, better service etc.)<p>I believe a and b will lead to net jobs gain in the longer term, rather than jobs lost overall by the printing company and related companies.<p>[1] They stumbled on the model of an app store by accident.

2859924,comment,2859449,2859449,13,0,jdietrich,,,"Setting aside the riots, the prevalence of BBM amongst teenagers is a really astonishing phenomenon. Blackberry is <i>the</i> smartphone brand amongst British teenagers and if a peer group has ""gone BBM"" the network effects mean that no other brand is even worth contemplating. In the UK at least, RIM have practically given up on the corporate market and BlackBerry is increasingly seen solely as a youth brand. BBM is so deeply entrenched that there's a palpable backlash[1].<p>I'd love to see some research done on the ethnography of it all. The common argument is that BBM is a very cheap way of keeping in touch - unlimited data is 5 a month even on a prepaid tariff - but I'm not sure how well that argument holds up. Unlimited SMS has been that cheap for years and there are plenty of other options.<p>I think the real reason is more sophisticated. I think (but can't prove) that many of the enterprise features in BBM are hugely valuable to young people. Ubiquitous, instant delivery and read receipts are helpful for corporate users, but they're <i>vital</i> if you're a teenager who has just asked someone out on a date. The simple but highly nuanced implementation of message groups was clearly intended to allow easy and ad-hoc communication for business groups, but allows teenagers the fine-grained control they demand over their social circles.<p>In many ways, what Google are trying to achieve with Circles in Google+ has been achieved by teenagers using BBM. I think in many ways BBM is as important as Twitter, but entirely invisible to the outside world. I think we have a huge amount to learn from the runaway success of Blackberry amongst the youth.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt8hECfLu-k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt8hECfLu-k</a>",1312809223

The point is to help people push aside concerns about time and money when developing a new idea.  Because if a competitor of equal skill can duplicate your work in a fraction of the time, just because they have access to the results of your R&D, that's a strong incentive not to even bother in the first place.

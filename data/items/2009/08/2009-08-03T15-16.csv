This would be like if we had a discussion on American energy usage and talked all about how coal verse solar or about unplugging unused devices and nobody said a single thing about oil consumption the entire time. We can dance around with the little stuff all we want but the real issue is meat consumption. Organic farming is plenty sustainable if we all stopped eating meat so much. It uses more land, more food, and is far worse for the environment. If American's stopped eating meat 3 times a day and started eating it once or twice a week, it would solve a lot of problems. I just can't take articles like this seriously because he does nothing to address how poorly the status quo is and the real reasons behind it.

(I've done this 3 times, and yes it works however I fasted for a full 16-17 hours.)<p>Back story: I irresponsibly slept for 2-3 weeks. Racking up a sleep debt of sometimes 4 hours per night. So by the time that I decided to reset my schedule I was about 24 hours+ in sleep debt. Needless to say I used this exact method, I didn't eat for 16 hours before, and I had to get up a 7 so I stopped eating around 3PM. This was a bad idea, I didn't have a very filling lunch, and after a while if you've done this before you note that not eating makes you very very very sleepy. I left work around 5:15. I fell asleep around 5:30, unfortunately I was still driving at the time. The car veered into the oncomming lane (it was empty) and went up the curb, on which was a small hill. I was still asleep when this happened, and then the car went up so far it couldn't sustain, and it flipped back into my lane (this happened at 40-50 MPH). Needless to say I awoke scared shitless as I was plummeting towards the ground and my airbags were deploying.<p>I escaped the accident with just some cuts on my hand from the shattered glass from the side windows. My car was totaled. The officer who came on site gave me a 200$ ticket. My father took me to the hospital, where I was given a CAT scan and everything checked out fine. However I had no way of getting to work. The car wasn't worth much it was an 11 year old Ford Escort Coup. Blue book value was around $4,000. The moral of the story is, be thankful for what you have, sleep responsibly and take care of yourself.<p>The accident was last Monday.",1249312253

A provisional application (which exists only in the USA, to my knowledge) is essentially a placeholder, giving you one year to file the complete application.  Since it's essentially a disclosure of the substance of the invention, you can draft it by yourself -- there are sites on-line that will file a self-drafted provisional application for as little as $200.  Again, the most important purpose of the provisional application is to capture all relevant features of the invention in enough detail to prove that you are in possession of the invention -- for your lumbar support, you would probably want to talk about the shape and the physical properties (softness, hardness, elasticity) of the materials involved.<p>If you decide that the idea is really worthwhile, you can follow up with a complete patent application (which will cost you a few thousand dollars) any time within the next year.

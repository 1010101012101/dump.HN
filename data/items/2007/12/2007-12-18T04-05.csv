It reminds me of the times where I had been banging my head against a problem for a while, trying out different solutions, but none of the ones I came up with were any good. So I left it in a crummy state. <p>Then a few days/weeks latter I came back to it, and knew straight away how to solve it, and how bad all my previous attempts had been.",1197953688
90602,comment,90521,90521,0,0,kyro,,,"Digg has so much room to expand, I'm not sure why they haven't done so. For instance, users should be able to create 'sub-digg' pages for specific subjects that they can then build a community around, or even embed into their own sites, instead of using pligg, etc. By allowing niche communities to develop, quality of news will increase, and digg can become a pretty reputable and valuable source of news. Also, by catering to niches, users will see a greater value in using and contributing to digg. I still see digg as a novelty site which serves as a mere gateway for internet jokes and the typical anti-cop/george bush/microsoft/etc. shit.",1197953611
90601,story,,,10,16,lg,"Ask YC: is networking class worth it?",,"Hey, expert web app writers.  Problem: I have a choice between taking networking or mathematical logic in my final semester.  I prefer logic, but in June I'm joining a startup and there's pressure to learn ""the practical stuff.""  So the question is: would taking a networking class give me a big edge, vis a vis writing web apps?  Or is this stuff pretty easy to pick up?
Overview of the networking material is here: http://remus.rutgers.edu/cs352/F07/#Lecture_Notes
The course project is writing a bittorrent client in Java.",1197953411

90595,comment,90387,90572,0,0,neilc,,,"Well, that ""minority"" is essentially the same community that invented the term in the first place. It's not like what you're observing is some ghastly secret: the AI community hasn't been seriously trying to construct strong AI for 25+ years. ""AI"" is a bad term, and doesn't accurately describe much of the work that is done in the field -- fair enough. Considering that trying to build strong AI is a pipedream anyway (IMHO), I don't think that's such a disaster. The person asking the question was plainly talking about weak AI techniques anyway.",1197951801

The problem to me seems to be individual speakers who can vary so greatly as to make any one prediction, based on a population-phoneme histogram, very noisy.  Speech recognition works decently now when individuals train their own classifiers. I'm not sure why products don't coalesce around those specific voice profiles. Here's an example where, I think, one massive effort to collect many examples is actually more problematic than helpful. It may work for easily discriminated phonemes (e.g., one, two, three, four) but the pronounced lexicon is a minefield of starlust knights. Context helps greatly, but that's much more data than would be acquired in a 411 call.<p>We shall see...",1197950744
90590,comment,90585,90585,0,0,brooksbp,,,"1) Profile. You really shouldn't start blindly optimizing code without profiling.  Profile it, find your bottlenecks, optimize, rinse, and repeat.  You should also benchmark your hardware; run scripts that make requests to your www server.  Check out Apache's ab benchmark. Etc...<p>2) Cache. Google ""Memcached"".  Django has support for this.  This will alleviate huge database bottlenecks (if your app is read heavy). Also possibly consider some sort of FS (file-system) structure specific for your app.  It looks like you deal with a bunch of media files, that could get hard to manage without a proper FS plan.<p>3) Write clean code.  There is no sense in profiling, optimizing, caching, etc if your code is horrible.  Those things will lead to even worse, unreadable, unmanageable, possibly slower code.<p>From your description you asked slightly more specified questions, but you really need to understand the basics of above before specializing for your app.  At least that's what I believe.",1197950683

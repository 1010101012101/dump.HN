The impact such vulnerabilities can have on an organization is staggering.<p>When they're exploited, there can be huge sums of money lost. There can be serious legal ramifications. A company's reputation can be destroyed by a single incident. And those are just a few of the consequences.<p>Even when these vulnerabilities aren't exploited, there are still significant costs associated with fixing them, testing such fixes, deploying the fixes, and so forth.<p>Software is supposed to bring benefits to its users, not problems and costs. Costly problems with software will make many people angry.<p>Ruby, Ruby on Rails and some related software have had a very bad time lately. They have caused a lot of problems for a lot of people, and this has indeed resulted in anger and wasted monkey. Some people are making a sensible decision to look toward alternative technologies, to try to minimize their losses.<p>Instead of labeling such people as ""trolls"", the Ruby community as a whole needs to engage in some significant self-evaluation. Try to understand why people are expressing what they are, and perhaps even try to learn from what they're saying. Security is important, and the Ruby community needs to learn this fact.",1359853133

I think any earnest programmer who wants to get better would do well to study your contributions to this thread until they are sure they understand them.<p><i>For a domain expert in their domain of expertise, [long explicit names] are overhead.</i><p>Once you pass a certain threshold of complexity and/or time-investment, a well-designed program becomes its own domain of expertise. At that point there is great leverage to be had in finding a compact notation suitable for the recurring concepts of the system. In some ways, finding such a notation is <i>how</i> one ensures that the system has a good design and will keep it. As you point out, it (critically) is what enables us to keep more complex things in our heads. It also becomes an intimate part of the creative process  a good notation suggests new concepts and hints at how the system should grow.<p>Long explicit names are exactly what you don't want when it comes to the core concepts of a well-designed system. They are useful for things that aren't familiar and so need to be spelled out. But in a well-designed system, the most important concepts <i>are</i> familiar and it is a poor use of our limited cognitive capacity to constantly spell them out, for much the same reason that we prefer to say ""gas"" instead of ""liquid hydrocarbons"".

What's wrong with those?<p>Of course this is a common request for women's shoes, to combine attractiveness and comfort.  But that ends up being contradictory.  Attractiveness is often defined as some combination of a raised heel and exposing as much of the foot and toes as possible.  That means little material and padding, perhaps some kind of strap fasteners that chafe, and walking with the ankle unnaturally contorted on the high heel.  These are exactly contradictory to the requirements to make a comfortable shoe, which means a natural flat sole, covering the toes for protection, and surrounding the foot with plenty of padding to provide support up to the ankle.<p>Oversimplifying for effect, if you define attractiveness as heel height, then having both attractiveness and comfort indeed becomes impossible.<p>That all said, there probably is room to innovate in the space in managing those tradeoffs, or at least in bringing that to a wider market.

Or you could have them come up with something they've been wanting to do, then use the process of creating that solution to introduce them to the concepts behind programming, and to how to apply them.

5157897,comment,5157215,5157215,4,0,jules,,,"An argument that usually lets programmers understand why physicsists do this: to a physicist variables like x (position), v (velocity), p (momentum), R (radius) are as clear as i,j,k,l to a programmer. Using the longhand would not improve readability for them, just like using arrayIndex instead of i would not improve readability for a programmer. In fact for a physicist it is much <i>easier</i> to read the short variable names, since that's what we always use, and it makes it easier to recognize an entire expression in the blink of an eye. It also keeps expressions on one line instead of 5. Another thing is if you're not a physicist, chances are very good you are not going to understand the code anyway, or at least not without consulting a physics text or paper, in which they will use exactly the same variables x,p,v,R, and now you're glad that these correspond exactly to your program's variables. If you update an equation like T = dE/dS to temperature = infinitesimal_change_in_energy / infinitesimal_change_in_entropy, you have gained only superficial readability. If you don't understand the former you will not <i>truly</i> understand the latter either.",1359849686

The version that is known to exist can only be used if the plane is flying above the missile battery. If the radar is illuminating the plane in such a way that there is a mountain or other terrain behind it, there will be to much noise to make out the plane.

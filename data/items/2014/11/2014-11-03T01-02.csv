8548975,comment,8547910,8547910,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"&quot;Despite all the new constructions that have been presented, the security of white-box cryptography is very unclear. Almost all of the presented constructions have been shown insecure with academic cryptanalysis papers that have been published. Only a few constructions remain ‘unbroken’, but they are merely a minor tweak to existing constructions – hence the existing attacks will apply with little effort.&quot;<p>Actually, the security is quite clear. If your application is important and you have a motivated or funded attacker, white box cryptography isn&#x27;t going to do much for you.<p>That seems to be the overall point of the paper. You can add a small delay or confuse those who are curious but not dedicated.<p>&quot;These days, white-box cryptography is being used in real-world applications; mainly DRM applications. While academic attacks have been published, as far as we know, no attacks on commercial white-box implementations have been seen. Instead, attackers focus on other parts of the system and exploit the cryptographic functionality without attacking it.&quot;<p>This can also read &quot;we do not know if they have been attacked or not&quot;. (It&#x27;s not fair that not knowing implies assuming none have). In addition there&#x27;s also other ways attackers circumvent the use of white-box-crypto without needing to break it - they are aware of these but don&#x27;t address them in the paper.<p><i>Shrug</i> Waiting for secure obfuscators to get small enough.

Of course we still have the good old summer placement descriptions where &quot;typing numbers into Excel&quot; magically becomes &quot;solving serious engineering challenges&quot;.<p>Ultimately if you&#x27;re reviewing this sort of thing, you learn to use judgement about who is telling the truth and who isn&#x27;t.  Most of the time you can&#x27;t and you go by your gut instinct.<p>At a recent summer camp I help out at, we had maybe 20 students doing progrmaming projects.  Around 15 claimed some experience with programming either in their application or through email correspondence before the camp.  I think perhaps two managed to write a FizzBuzz program in under ten minutes?<p>I doubt this is something MIT is immune from.  It is a problem which particularly plagues undergraduate admissions where students are pressured into making the most boring events sound spectactular in order to compete with about a thousand other people.  This is why almost all the top institutions interview.<p>I once spoke to an admissions tutor at Oxford (Physics) and he said that essentially they ignore the application.  They&#x27;ll interview you if your grades are good enough and go solely on that.  If your grades are close, but your application is great then they&#x27;ll consider it.  They introduced entrance exams, but even they were a poor performance indicator because rich kids pay tutors to help them prepare which skews the results.",1414979546

8548935,comment,8548133,8548409,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"First let&#x27;s get some perspective on the sums involved. One of the tip4commit spams I got after a commit informed me that my tip balance was 0.00000171 BTC. At current exchange rate this is equivalent in US dollars to $0.0005525523.<p>In other words, at a rate like that, it requires nearly two thousand tips just to add up to a single US dollar worth of tips.<p>And it gets worse. Remember that tip4commit &quot;refunds&quot; the tip back into the project pool if it&#x27;s not claimed within 30 days. So just to get money out of this, you have to be making enough in tips, every 30 days, to overcome the cost in both time and potentially transaction fees of claiming the tips.<p>And then you have to do a bit more figuring to see if the money you&#x27;ll get once cashed out is enough to justify the bookkeeping cost it imposes on you; after all, now that&#x27;s income that you need to keep records of and figure into your taxes, which is not a zero-cost thing.<p>So first of all, you need to figure out the expected amount of tips, both over rolling 30-day periods and over the course of a year, which <i>again</i> is not a zero-cost thing, since if nothing else it involves spending time, and calculate whether they are enough to overcome the friction of getting the money out of tip4commit and then the cost of keeping records of and reporting it.<p>It is highly unlikely at this time that any person will be earning enough in tips from tip4commit to reach the point at which it becomes profitable even to the tune of a few units of local currency. A final data point for this: tip4commit states that it tips out at 1% of the balance of the project on each commit. Its attempt to tip me 0.00000171 BTC was for a commit on Django, which means the balance of donations for Django at that time was 0.000171 BTC, which simply cannot be enough to make it worth while for any person who contributes code to Django. And I don&#x27;t rate it likely that there are a bunch of other projects with balances significantly larger, which means it is probable that there is currently no individual developer in the world for whom accepting tips from tip4commit is a profitable activity.<p>And that&#x27;s without getting into the problems associated with the site displaying your name in tipping lists even if you never accept them, or the problems associated with displaying <i>projects</i> -- quite a few large open-source projects have associated non-profit foundations, and are bound by law regarding donations made for specific directed purposes. Although you can argue it&#x27;s unlikely any person or organization would ever actually be punished based on tip4commit listing them, it certainly <i>is</i> possible that they could be called upon to prove that they are unaffiliated with tip4commit and refuse to accept the tips. Which, once again, is not zero-cost; now it potentially costs individuals and projects time and/or money for <i>something they had no control over because tip4commit &quot;opted&quot; them in forcibly and continues to drag its feet on opt-out</i>.<p>All in all, this is a mess. It probably should just shut down, but if it stays operating it&#x27;s going to keep getting heat, and will keep deserving it, until it switches to being based only on explicit opt-in.",1414978827
8548934,comment,8546702,8546702,0,0,userbinator,,,"The problem of smooth scrolling without much-increased CPU usage was solved long ago, in the era of 8-bit systems, by rendering slightly more lines to the framebuffer and simply changing the address in VRAM where the CRT controller started reading the data for a frame. The CPU could then render the additional scrolled-out lines in the background.<p>But it seems the common way to implement scrolling today is to either have the CPU or GPU actually move the data unnecessarily; there&#x27;s no easy way to do the equivalent of adjusting the pointer to the window&#x27;s data in memory so that the windowing system can scroll without having to perform any data movement.<p>Asus&#x27; trackpad driver may be at fault for turning the CPU up to 100%, but to me this is a sign of a deeper problem having to do with how inefficiently applications are doing their scrolling, and the APIs that encourage this inefficient way of doing it.",1414978796

At school/university you don&#x27;t know about &#x27;death marches&#x27;, the obligation to work in a focused manner for more hours in the week than the stereotypical &#x27;junior doctor&#x27; (allegedly they put in all the hours) or that projects are likely to be managed by people that cannot be bothered to learn the slightest thing about how things work &#x27;under the hood&#x27;.<p>The same could be said for almost any other profession - teachers go into it with idealism then get jaded once they find out the reality of what is asked for them. Same with anything else to varying extents.<p>IMHO there are lots of different types of programmers with different motivations. Some are product/client/customer focused, plenty are not. Some fail to see programming as a creative endeavour - it might as well be car mechanics to them.

8548918,comment,8546546,8546562,0,0,sanderjd,,,"This is neat. I really admire the willingness to document the type of stumbling around that characterizes lots of real programming, but which you rarely see.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bummer you can&#x27;t do `LevelMap::new()` like you want, but here are two things that work that I think are improvements on your `mklevel` function:<p><pre><code>    fn mklevel() -> LevelMap { HashMap::new() }
</code></pre>
That works because once the compiler knows that the return type is `LevelMap`, which it knows is really `HashMap<Coord, int>`, it can infer which variant of `HashMap::new` to call. Using this same idea, you can get closer to what you originally wanted without the function, like this:<p><pre><code>    let mut map: LevelMap = HashMap::new();
</code></pre>
There are also a couple things that I think are good syntactic improvements over the `Coord{x: 0, y: 0}` syntax that you made the `xy` function to avoid. First, you can just use a tuple:<p><pre><code>    type LevelMapTuple = HashMap<(int, int), int>;

    let mut maptuple: LevelMapTuple = HashMap::new();
    maptuple.insert((0, 0), 0);
</code></pre>
If you still want to give it a name, which I think is pretty nice, you can use a struct with anonymous members, like this:<p><pre><code>    struct Coord(int, int);
    
    let mut map: LevelMap = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(Coord(0, 0), 0);
</code></pre>

8548917,comment,8548369,8548369,0,0,bane,,,"I think, like many movements, the &quot;foodie&quot; movement is a reaction to the kind of mass-consumer food that became prevalent over the last few decades. The kind of ho-hum average and entirely consistent food that you could get any season, with different stores staffed by different people thousands of miles away from each other. You can get practically the exact same meal in Winter in Boston as you can in Summer in Nevada. Want sushi from your local Mr. Tuna in Colorado? No problem!<p>It&#x27;s interesting to revisit the chains that were popular when I was growing up, the ones that haven&#x27;t really changed their decor or menus. The food tastes exactly like I remember it, and it&#x27;s honestly terrible. But growing up I didn&#x27;t know it was bad, all food everywhere basically tasted like this. It was either this or local mom & pop homestyle stuff...nothing special.<p>Looking back, I think I grew up at an intersection of two events: people were becoming affluent enough to eat something other than food cooked at home, and we had become so enamored with our ability to provide any season, hyper-consistent food that we never stopped to ask if it was a good idea.<p>Think about how many Chotchkie&#x27;s-style casual dining restaurants there are, all virtually interchangeable from each other. Once you start to hit a number of locations in the hundreds, it&#x27;s just inevitable.<p>I think foodie-ism is looking at this ossifying industry and finding it relatively easy to disrupt. It can get pretentious at times, with lists of all the locally sourced ingredients in the homemade ketchup, but it also means you can get good food for a change. It means that if you have 20 restaurants, you have 20 actual choices of places to eat and not groups of interchangeable taste-alikes.<p>Even in traditionally <i>very</i> manufactured food places, the burger joint, newer franchises like In-n-Out or Shake Shack, which actually artificially limit their expansion to ensure the kinds of ultra-high quality ingredients they use are available.<p>Honestly, if you like food at all, it&#x27;s an awesome time to be alive, I have no idea how we made it through the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.",1414978134

8548870,comment,8547417,8548156,0,0,SiVal,,,"The network effect I&#x27;m talking about is the N-squared growth in value of a network of N nodes where each of the N nodes derives most of its value from the number (N-1) of other nodes. The phone system overall has this property, so does Skype, so does Facebook, but no carrier, handset maker, or OS does, because their users aren&#x27;t limited to interacting with the other users of the same carrier/handset/OS.<p>Instead, the existing players have a benefit resulting from their size that is more of a scale advantage, in that the N users tend to have access to more things if N is larger, but those &quot;things&quot; are not primarily the N-1 other users. There are more iPhone apps than Android, for example, yet Android sells more units and is growing faster. Scale matters, number of apps matters, but other factors are very significant, too.<p>Apple, therefore, does not have to be the #1 phone maker to make the most money, nor would a new entrant have to have huge scale to have a profitable business. Unlike a network effect business, a new entrant would not have to appeal primarily on the basis of how many other users it already had but, instead, on what value it offered.<p>And you mention that Amazon couldn&#x27;t get you to switch from iOS because of the number of iOS apps as if the 2 billion phone users out there all care primarily about the number of apps they&#x27;ll probably never use. Yet Android phones outsell iOS with fewer available apps, and the average Android user buys far fewer apps than the average iPhone user. A significant fraction seem to be satisfied with just the apps that come with the phone and never buy another.<p>It&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that there may be many market segments that would be fine with a few thousand apps covering 99%+ of usage PLUS something <i>else</i> they value more highly than the long-tail iPhone apps. Phones and phone plans that specialize in offering something more valuable than Yet More Apps might appeal to many people. Shoppers might care more about Amazon Prime than than the one game app they have to give up if they switch. Parents might care more about a managed kid phone with kid features and a kid rate plan than about Apple&#x27;s app store.<p>Since the value of phones is not primarily the number of your maker&#x27;s installed base squared but is based on so many possible things, I think there is room for new entrants as long as they offer something more significant to a market than the extra apps.",1414976778

8548861,comment,8548541,8548783,0,0,mmarx,,,"> So how did someone from West Berlin travel to, say, Frankfurt by car?<p>There were few approved transit routes from West Berlin to West Germany. So you could get a transit visa (which you had to pay for in west german currency) upon getting on one of those routes and present it to exit the GDR again (you weren&#x27;t allowed to leave the transit route midway, and if you took to long to pass through, you&#x27;d be questioned). Note that transit between West Berlin and West Germany is different from simply crossing between the two Germanies[0], which was relatively easy for est german citizens, but particularly difficult to do for east german citizens.<p>>  What was to stop someone from East Germany doing the same thing? The wall only went through the city, right?<p>The wall may have only gone through the city, but there still were border checkpoints[1] outside of Berlin.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_inner_German_border#Border_crossing_regulations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_inner_German_borde...</a>

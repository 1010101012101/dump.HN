Living costs are very low (even in these cities) for what you get compared to the suburbs in the USA.  There is some brain drain, but the culture and quality of life is the ""pull"" that the original article was describing.  Most Scots who are brain drained away come back to raise kids or retire.",1346842775

Here was your original:-<p><pre><code>  static inline int str_compare( const char *a, const char *b )\n  {\n        for(;*a == *b; ++a, ++b)\n        {\n                if (*a == '\0' || *b == '\0')\n                {\n                        return( 0 );\n                }\n        }\n        return( *a - *b );\n  }\n\n  Inside the loop, if *a is a NUL then so will *b, so you don't need to test for both to be NUL. Also, if *a is NUL and *b is NUL then ( *a - *b ) will be 0. You can just iterate through the string when *a are equal and non-NUL, and then return the difference between the two characters so:-\n\n  static inline int str_compare( const char *a, const char *b )\n  {\n        for(; (*a == *b) && *a; ++a, ++b);\n        return( *a - *b );\n  }\n</code></pre>\n[ C-Holy-War ] Personal style preferences; I prefer while loops, so much so that it has been <i>years</i> since I've purposely written a for loop in C and writing C is what I do for my job. For loops likes that end up looking like line noise, I'd find the following much easier on the eye and, more importantly, more immediately obvious to anyone else reading the code as to what it does:-<p><pre><code>  static inline int str_compare( const char *a, const char *b )\n  {\n        while( ( *a == *b ) && *a )\n        {\n                a++; b++;\n        }\n        return( *a - *b );\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBut, as I said, that's my own style preference.

I think this for a few reasons.<p>The first is that the VC funding is just not at the same levels as in the US. Secondly, the talent pool is way to small. As much as we like to think the presence of 4 universities in Glasgow alone must mean we are overflowing with people this just isn't the case, you are lucky if you have 40 final year students in a CS course, and maybe around 15% of them are actually ""excellent"", and the numbers have been decreasing over the years. I have at least 4 friends that were looking to recruit in the last month or so and each one has been despondent about the quality of the candidates. Then finally you are going to be in a dog fight with the large financial institutions that dominate the hiring of new grads. Graduates here are still relatively conservative in what kind of job they want.<p>However, where I do think we can excel is in creating tech startups that don't focus so much on the consumer side of things.

This is the code we speed up.<p>An order of magnitude improvement is saying that - hand waving - you can have a hot monster at 10x OoO SS performance or a cool little chip equiv to the OoO SS but low power.<p>However, the faster you crunch the bits between main memory stalls, the more dominating those stalls become.  Its diminishing returns.  And hot is not good.<p>So we talk more about sweet spots like 3x performance and 3x less power, and temper them appropriately.<p>The numbers are based on sim and experienced estimates.

This has been argued again and again, and what is always comes down to is that, according to the Keynesians, an inflationary currency is <i>preferable</i> for encouraging economic growth, but the reality is that A) economics is not hard science and B) as long as the inflation/deflation rate isn&#x27;t extreme, both inflationary and deflationary goods make fine exchange mechanisms.<p>>supply of the coins need to gradually increase to support the flow of spending.<p>Why? If adoption increases, the value goes up, and people spend fewer bitcoins for the same thing. Bitcoin is especially good at this because it has a lot of base units.<p>>They will sell their BT for currency rather buy depreciating goods with them.<p>This is incorrect. You&#x27;re arguing the extreme of the effects of deflation. People <i>will</i> buy goods with deflationary assets, because sometimes the expected value of owning a good is higher than the expected value of keeping an equivalent value of the deflationary asset.<p>The equivalent (and equally incorrect) ad extremum argument against <i>inflation</i> is &quot;With inflationary currencies, no one will bother working, because they know the payoff of their labor will be worth less by the time they get it.&quot;",1395939566

7481697,comment,7481244,7481595,2,0,a-priori,,,"I disagree, because Bitcoin&#x27;s monetary policy can be changed at any time. In fact, Dogecoin, which uses a fork of the Bitcoin code, just changed theirs a short time ago, without much fuss, to a continuous inflation policy like you mentioned. I agree that for either of them to be used as a currency (rather than just for speculation), a low and stable level of inflation is necessary.<p>But that&#x27;s all about inflation in the long term. In the short term, the rate of inflation depends on other factors such as the rate of capital moving into the Bitcoin economy and the rate of Bitcoins being lost.<p>So right now, there&#x27;s no reason people should hold back on adopting Bitcoin because of its current monetary policy of having a fixed maximum number of coins. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a fixed amount of money or time that can be invested in it; there&#x27;s no reason people like Stripe and merchants can&#x27;t do their bit at the same time core Bitcoin developers do theirs..",1395939520
7481696,comment,7475125,7479438,2,0,T-hawk,,,"What makes AI difficult in these games is pattern recognition of higher level strategic abstractions.  A human player can recognize that placing a Go stone or a Terran command center projects some power in regions around that spot.  The human can use intuitive pattern matching to assess when he has a superior force in an area and can push to a decisive tactical victory, even if the human isn&#x27;t quantifying every move in precise terms.  An AI must quantify every bit of power projection somehow, which becomes impossible with present computing resources in games whose possible state space quickly explodes into 10^10 or more possibilities.<p>It&#x27;s actually a similar problem to computer vision.  Identifying a battle front from the current state of a war game and recognizing the tactical possibilities is similar to edge detection in a photograph and recognizing objects.  Humans do that essentially with highly parallel computations and lookups by billions of neurons.  Until we get billion-core CPUs and billion-ported RAM, AIs will not have the same capability.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve done some development on AI for Civilization.  It sits somewhere between Go and Starcraft in AI capabilities.  Civilization is turn-based like Go, but the state space explodes far more quickly like Starcraft when you have 100 units which can each make a dozen moves in 100! different orders on a turn.  (In Civ, the order on which units act each turn is extremely important, where workers lay down railroads for other units to move, or where you attack a city with artillery before the ground pounders.)",1395939518

(It completely sidesteps the permissioning issues involved in write permission on a global cache at first execution, for example.)<p>However, hacking an existing package manager to do this job may not be entirely trivial --- and, in typical server environments these days, there will often be more than one package manager to hack.  Language-based package managers like Rubygems and npm, for example, build binary extensions for Ruby and Node/Javascript as part of their job.  Updating any of them to deal with an additional &quot;specialization&quot; step may not be much of a big deal --- but dealing with <i>all</i> of them might be.

That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s not just one &quot;Mill&quot;, it&#x27;s a family.<p>What we can say is that for equivalent computation capacity (i.e. number of functional units) the Mill will give somewhat better performance at much better power. Internally, the Mill&#x27;s power budget is essentially the same as that of a DSP with the same function capacity, because they work in much the same way. DSPs have been around for a long time, and the power/performance comparisons with OOO have been long published. For equal process and equal Mips capacity the power difference for the core is 8-12x better than OOO, and we expect to do at least as well.<p>That&#x27;s for equal compute capacity. Every architecture has a cap on scaling compute capacity. The cap seems to be around 8 pipelines in OOO machines; try to add more and you just slow down everything more than you gain from the extra pipes.<p>The Mill has caps too. We don&#x27;t know yet where the diminishing returns point will be in detail, but our sims and engineering expertise suggests that it will be somewhere in the 30-40 pipes region. Such a high-end Mill would swap a good deal - but not all - of its power advantage for more horsepower.<p>You have the inverse story at the low end of the family: the lowest Mill has only five pipes, and no floating point at all. Not barn-burning performance, but much lower power even than existing non-OOO offerings.<p>So there&#x27;s no one number, and no hard measurements anyway. If you doubt our projections then you are entitled to your opinion; in fact there&#x27;s a fair amount of disagreement even within the Mill team as to what we will see in the actual chip. But the team includes quite a few who have been doing this for years, and in several cases were involved in the creation of the chips that you would compare the Mill against, so their considered opinion should not be rejected out of hand.",1395939307

It seems the consensus is that in the absence of an ideal solution, we love credit cards (especially in the USA). Two really important things:<p>1. Consumer protections are not a Credit Card thing - chargebacks and literally every single protection CC&#x27;s give you are legally mandated by Regulation E - all payment processors must have them in place. It&#x27;s unclear how this will relate to BTC, but other solutions (including my own) have this to the letter the same way CC&#x27;s do. CC&#x27;s want you to believe it&#x27;s them, it&#x27;s not - the US Government made those regulations.<p>2. Yes Billing and Shipping Address are needed in every instance - but there are better ways than typing them out, especially on a mobile phone. Sure there are services that can save that info for you, but a better solution is a network that already knows that info. Stripe could build that with their &quot;remember me&quot; features, I&#x27;ve built that by using the information your bank has. There are solutions, and we need them to move into mobile commerce where it&#x27;s impossible for every app to have your info pre-saved.

When I was reading applications (odd yet delightful to use the past tense) the main thing I looked for was energetic founders working on an idea that grew organically out of their own experience.

Billing address is usually the same as shipping address.  That leaves the CC number, in which case the equivalent is your bitcoin address.  So there&#x27;s no real win here.  And if you&#x27;re using a regular online shop, then they probably have all these details saved.  With Amazon, I can buy things with one click.  With Newegg and other stores that I use regularly, its two.  I haven&#x27;t seen any bitcoin experience that matches that.  Reading up on &quot;experiences&quot; people have with Overstock and Tiger Direct, it all seems very roundabout and inconvenient.  And then you&#x27;re hit with shit like no refunds to top it off.<p>> Even at it&#x27;s best in the Stripe Checkout model, it&#x27;s less than ideal and extremely unsafe - it&#x27;s so unsafe that American Express is RUNNING COMMERCIALS ADVERTISING HOW UNSAFE THEIR PROCESS IS!<p>Pull is less safe than push, yes.  Bitcoin is undoubtedly more secure than giving your CC number.  But pull is more convenient for consumers, as I outlined above.<p>There&#x27;s work-arounds for credit cards, such as virtual card numbers, but they haven&#x27;t gained broader consumer penetration for the exact reason that they&#x27;re inconvenient.  In practice, the &quot;unsafe but you can get the charges reversed&quot; system works well enough that promoting a new system based on the fact that its safer isn&#x27;t really enough.<p>> For your convenience, let&#x27;s 2.9% and $0.30 of every transaction. That&#x27;s a huge drain on the margin for a business of any size, but especially someone with checkout size about 10-50 bucks and margins of 10-40%.<p>Not every business charges 2.9%.  Many get rates as low as 1% (this is what we charged large corporations, if I remember correctly).  With bitcoin, you&#x27;re going to get hit with transaction fees, exchange fees, and exchange spread.  For small shops, its likely that will come out less than the CC fees, but for bigger stores its questionable.<p>Edit:  Note that I hope these problems will be solved.  Ideally, we see the Bitcoin protocol and ecosystem mature such that it is  as convenient as a credit card and safer to boot.",1395938612

7481370,comment,7480278,7480538,6,0,cpleppert,,,">>All of which is to say, I think the 10x they&#x27;re talking about is unrealistic.<p>I think that is putting it mildly and is a little strange to somehow claim in the first place. That can&#x27;t possibly be true, their isn&#x27;t room for a 10X increase in optimization on an Intel core chip and would be impossible to reach based on memory bandwidth and the amount of execution resources available on a chip alone.  The ideas they have concretely put forth simply don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t really provide a performance increase.<p>Take their virtual memoryless implementation. Getting rid of virtual memory doesn&#x27;t buy you a whole lot especially when you need to add in a protection mechanism that looks a lot like a TLB in the first place(and must have the same general properties to provide protection, you just gain very marginal lookup costs).<p>If you do the math, this can&#x27;t add more than 1-2% in performance in common application software at the cost of making every modern operating system unusable and increasing memory consumption(embedded systems anyone?). If getting rid of virtual memory was so great, why didn&#x27;t someone do it in every other preceding clean room architecture? My answer: It isn&#x27;t.<p>Or consider how they want to do branch prediction: add a separate ISA to do static branch prediction that is added by the compiler and loaded asynchronously by another cpu component and then supplied to the main cpu.<p>First of all, this doesn&#x27;t work. The CPU can&#x27;t have performance critical data pushed to it by another component. There is a reason the Branch prediction table and branch target buffers are small and focused and able to be accessed quickly. Secondly, static branch prediction is awful. You simply must be able to modify branch prediction data as the CPU executes to provide optimum performance. So it seems they want to be more power hungry, more complex, and have less performance than a mainstream CPU when it comes to branch prediction.<p>It is possible I have misinterpreted some elements of this scheme but basic design decisions like putting branch prediction into a separate component of the CPU simple don&#x27;t make sense at all from a chip layout perspective.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not really sure where the performance is supposed to come from with the &#x27;belt&#x27; in the first place. Data dependency is incredibly complex in a modern pipelined cpu and while it is possible to reduce the cost by precompiling software for an optimized CPU the benefits are all very low level and really don&#x27;t extend beyond reduced power consumption(assuming compilation cost can be amortized). At some point, to get more instruction level parallelism you simply have to bite the bullet and do dynamic out of order scheduling in the CPU to extract more performance. This has a well defined cost and an upper level limitation on how much total parallelism a CPU can extract from an instruction stream. Think of it another way: a static compiler has less information than a running CPU so one can&#x27;t expect it to be able to extract more parallelism than the CPU itself.",1395937325

Everybody uses the EDA tools to create caches, so everybody will get similar power numbers.

He said something to the effect that they would approach performance for {OOO|~Haswell|Haswell} using less power. It was a very general statement, which I took to mean that a Mill family member intended for GP PC desktop use could approach - not match or exceed - performance of a typical GP PC desktop processor while using less power. Which is certainly not something we&#x27;ve never heard before. And I think the statement is coming from theoretical calculation.<p>As far as difference with Itanium: I don&#x27;t know anything about processor design, but I am pretty certain the belt concept central to the Mill is not applied in the Itanium/EPIC. I think it&#x27;s likely that the Mill is intended to support more operations per instruction than Itanium.

7481295,comment,7480857,7480857,8,0,ryandrake,,,"Spatial data structures are great, and heavily used in all kinds of mapping applications. Most of the systems I&#x27;ve worked with used the more constrained quadtree structure, where the map is divided into uniformly-sized tiles, and a level-of-detail hierarchy is built. This is good for raster data, where each tile is a picture and the whole world is covered by tiles. The R-tree has great advantages when the complexity is not uniformly distributed across the map, for example, vector road data, where vast areas on earth have no data, and most of the data is concentrated in small urban areas.<p>I believe PostGIS, which adds spatial operations to Postgres, uses an R-tree as its spatial index.<p>An improvement on the R-tree, the R(star)-tree, uses a different node splitting algorithm and includes re-insertions (similar to balancing a B-tree), reducing both coverage and overlap. The insertion complexity is greater, but in general, R(star)-tree query performance tends to be a bit better for mapping applications. Generally, maps don&#x27;t change that often, so building the tree tends to happen far less often than querying it.<p>There are many more specialized spatial data structures available, for example, Kd-trees, which can be perfectly balanced and are useful for storing point data.<p>If you&#x27;re really interested in this stuff, the holy bibles for spacial data structures (which I keep in a special place on my bookshelf) are a pair of books written by H.

Three reasons.<p>First, I&#x27;ve been enough places where Internet connectivity is so poor that HTTPS effectively breaks the connection. I used to stay half the week somewhere where the only connectivity was a dire, over-saturated 3G link. I couldn&#x27;t browse HTTPS sites unless I was very lucky.<p>Second, I&#x27;m uneasy with the implication that &quot;HTTPS=secure&quot;, in that it absolves the user of taking any responsibility for their own security. A site can require a HTTPS connection and still store the password in cleartext, for example; so unless you have a unique password, this &quot;secure&quot; site can still screw you. Yeah, I know HN readers understand the difference, but IMX most people dimly understand a binary distinction between &quot;secure site&quot; and &quot;not secure site&quot; and that&#x27;s it.<p>Third and related, the corollary of &quot;HTTPS=secure&quot; is that &quot;sites that only use HTTP = insecure&quot;. This is leading to a requirement that any guy who builds a website with login functionality needs to implement HTTPS, and that saddens me. The web becomes less democratic, less meritocratic, the more technical hurdles we require.<p>But, like I say, I realise 99.9% of people disagree with me.",1395936884

What I meant to say was &quot;Please note, the types of things homeopathy is prescribed for are <i>GENERALLY</i> self limiting. Your body will heal over time without intervention, so yes! You will feel an improvement! The remedy you took has nothing to do with it though.&quot;<p>> What I am talking about is Sinusitis and there is no treatment of it in allopathy apart from operation and the allopathic doctors themselves say that after operation it will again return in 1-2 years.<p>Completely and totally incorrect.<p><a href=""http://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/the-best-treatment-for-sinus-complaints/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/the-best-treatm...</a><p>>The best treatment, first line, is nasal irrigation with saline solution to just move the stuff along. If you took all the people in the world who say they have chronic sinusitis, and you put them all on nasal saline irrigations, a big proportion would not have any symptoms anymore.<p>>After that would be medications, like steroids, which are anti-inflammatory drugs. And if you can actually culture bacteria from a patient’s sinuses and know what you’re treating, antibiotics are appropriate. Decongestants, when appropriately used for a limited duration, are incredibly effective at relieving the obstruction and letting the sinuses drain.<p>>The sinusitis patients who do well are the ones who really abide by using the neti pot or the saline irrigation bottles. And whether we add additional medications or not to the saline, it’s that mechanical flushing and lavage that really has a tremendous effect. Because it’s getting rid of the mucus, getting rid of all the inflammatory cells and whatever bacteria are there.<p>The vast majority of sinusitis cases resolve on their own within 10 days. The cause of most cases is a viral infection.<p>Chronic sinusitis can be caused by asthma or allergies, which are known to spontaneously reverse with age. Or pollutants, etc, which can be removed from your living environment, even on accident.<p>Sinusitis surgery is far from the first line of treatment.<p>Sinusitis surgery isn&#x27;t just one surgery, it is tailored to the individual patient and their causes and symptoms. for example, removal of infected, swollen, or damaged tissue if that is what is causing it. Can remove some bone if the sinuses are unusually small, or polyps if that is what is causing it. While it is true that sinusitis can reoccur after surgery, it is far from guaranteed. &quot;Will again return in 1-2 years&quot; is absolutely stupid and false. It depends a lot on the patient, their immune system, the type of surgery, the cause, and importantly, post-op care. Not to mention luck!<p>I had a chronic cough for years, caused by post nasal drip. No medications helped at all, I tried all of them. Nobody could figure out what was even causing it. One day though, it resolved completely by itself. I still do get mild flareups once in a great while for a week or two though. People have even been known to spontaneously recover from cancer. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_remission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_remission</a><p>The other interesting thing is in the case of cervical cancer. The Human papillomavirus virus (HPV) can cause  precancerous changes in the cervix. Mostly, these changes just reverse themselves. When you get an abnormal pap test, as long as the changes aren&#x27;t very advanced, the course of action is &quot;wait and see&quot; to see if your body fixes the problem. In the vast majority of the cases it does, only a few with abnormal pap test will go on to develop cervical cancer. I had an abnormal pap with &quot;low grade changes&quot; several years ago. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Guess what? We just retested me in a year and I was good to go. My body fixed itself.<p>>I have experienced the results on myself and have seen the difference and hence highly doubt those studies.<p>That is extremely flawed reasoning. See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence</a><p>For example, if everytime I had a cold I did 25 situps in the morning. My cold always went away. I can not then conclude that 25 situps in the morning is a cure for the cold.<p>Please review the cited studies (See the GP) for bias.",1395936158

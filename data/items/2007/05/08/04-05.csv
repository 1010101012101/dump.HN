20431,comment,20219,20412,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Well Russ. The point is not the number.It's like saying your startup has only 2% chances of succeeding. It is just to say something the majority. In my case what I am saying is that not every one has the same opinion. And that is exactly what makes the Internet powerful. If we all wanted the same opinion we would read USA Today, but no we come here and find people who think completely differently from others. But the best thing is that within that group, they still think differently from one person to the other. \nAgain, if they are 5 people in a room and they always have the same ideas and principles, They are never going to learn from each other.

Some would argue that they play dirty poker, but shutting Photobucket down at a crucial point in the acquisition negotiations was a brilliant move, and may have shaved hundreds of millions of dollars off of the purchase price.<p>\nOuch.",1178598923

20420,comment,20419,20419,0,0,inklesspen,,,"I got tired of waiting for News.YC to implement the comments links in a format usable by my newsreader. (Yes, I know they're in there, but I don't know of any reader that actually uses the comment tags.) So I made this one. When you hit it, it downloads the feed from News.YC and reformats it into an Atom feed (I like Atom; there's only one standard, not 9 like there are for RSS (see <a href=""http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/02/04/incompatible-rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/02/04/incompatible-rss</a> )). The feed is cached for the next five minutes in order to be nice to pg's servers.<p>Total code: approximately ten lines of Python, thanks to some excellent libraries like <a href=""http://www.feedparser.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feedparser.org/</a><p>pg, if you have any technical adjustments you'd like me to make, like adjusting the time between hits to your rss feed, let me know.",1178596945

If you use our browser extension you can make disposable credit cards for your transactions right from online checkout pages. The best way to use a Masked Card is to create it for the exact amount of the transaction once you know the total. Then when you use it, the card instantly becomes worthless. In this way it works like a gift card.<p>We also have iPhone and Android app&#x27;s where you can create these Masked Cards in stores as you&#x27;re about to check out. Cashiers just need to be willing to type in the 16 digit # and expiration, which they usually are fine with.",1399899582

7732418,comment,7729538,7731662,1,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Also the whole thing about not being able to change scenario seems off, I do remember literally saying, you know what dream would be better? The other one. And then switching to that dream.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve done that too. But dreams that are just random and dreams that are based on real experiences and &quot;issues&quot; you may have are different, in my personal experience. You may transform into Iron Man and just go ballistic, but in my personal experience, what starts out fun and empowering will likely break down; Iron Man&#x27;s weapons stop working quite as well, then they just plain stop working, then despite the fact he can fly <i>away</i> it turns out he&#x27;s always also flying right back <i>to</i> the problem... dreams are not a perfectly-accurate 3D VR simulation of the world, they are heavily influenced by your internal mental and emotional state, deeply symbolic (and I don&#x27;t mean in the &quot;this tree is your mother&quot; way, I mean, you are not truly visually processing data, you are not navigating in a true 3D space, you are navigating through the highly-processed symbolic representation of the space that is the end result of all your visual processing, which is a very different space than the true 3D world, despite its correspondences) and in fact often quite lacking in true spatial structure, and if you&#x27;re having problems, you won&#x27;t be able to escape them by flying away in a dream anymore than you can solve your issues by just &quot;stopping thinking about them&quot;... for indeed, they are the <i>exact same thing</i>, so if the latter sounds foolish, so should the former.<p>I think a lot of people, lacking control of their dreams, end up reversing cause and effect. With real issues and not just &quot;night terrors&quot; (random nightmares), you&#x27;re having a bad dream because you have mental or emotional issues... you don&#x27;t have mental/emotional issues because you have bad dreams. It&#x27;s a fun metaphor in movies like Inception, but it&#x27;s not how it actually works... as usual, the reality is a great deal more prosaic, and less full of easy answers.",1399899566
7732417,comment,7731624,7731624,3,0,userbinator,,,"Although I&#x27;ve not worked with much scientific code, I think the phrase &quot;best practices&quot; has a lot to do with why this phenomenon happens; those who were subjected to formal software engineering education will have been exposed to them, and unfortunately for many, the <i>best</i> in &quot;best practices&quot; leads them to believe that these are the ultimate way to do something and should always be followed. Instead of thinking and reasoning about the problem, they are taught to apply a set of &quot;best practices&quot;, and that doing so will provide the best solution. When faced with a problem, dogmatic adherence to these principles replaces actual thinking, and groupthink further indoctrinates them into something resembling a religion. Engineering is all about tradeoffs when solving problems. There is <i>never</i> a universal &quot;best&quot; practice that fits all situations, so I think anyone who claims to be practicing or teaching &quot;software engineering&quot; does not deserve to be called a &quot;software engineer&quot; if the bulk of their thought process consists of regurgitating &quot;best practices&quot;.<p>On the other hand, those who haven&#x27;t will approach the problem from a completely different perspective: they&#x27;ll be primarily concerned with solving the problem itself, and will tend to use actual thought rather than relying on memorised practices. It&#x27;s true that this can lead to &quot;bad code&quot; depending on their skill level and knowledge, but they&#x27;ll also be far less likely to overcomplicate things and more easily understand and use abstractions appropriately. One of my favourite examples of this is the demoscene; it&#x27;s comprised of programmers, most of them young and self-taught and never subjected to formal CS education or &quot;best practices&quot;, who manage to do pretty amazing things with software and hardware. That&#x27;s why I believe these people, the ones who learned &quot;bottom up&quot; from the basic principles of how the computer works and how it can be programmed, can eventually produce better code than the &quot;indoctrinated software engineers&quot; who were taught more on <i>what</i> to think than <i>how</i> to think.",1399899553

7732395,comment,7730472,7731135,1,0,jerf,,,"IE 4 was a better browser than Netscape. I think we may finally be distant enough that we can drop our allegiances and just admit that. Netscape did not randomly decide to drop everything and rewrite a browser, they did it because they were trapped in a terrible, terrible code base that could not easily be extended to grow into the future. Netscape &quot;layers&quot;, their answer to what we at the time called DHTML and today don&#x27;t even have a name for it because it&#x27;s just how the web <i>works</i>, were atrocious, and it was directly a result of their code base not being able to do anything else.<p>Netscape was boned either way... not doing a from-scratch rewrite would still have doomed them to being stuck behind Microsoft for a long time. It would have allowed them to keep making releases instead of just going silent, but they still would not have been able to be as good as IE. And they&#x27;d have still be stuck hard by the fact that Microsoft monopoly&#x27;d the price of a browser down to 0... and Microsoft would probably have monolopy&#x27;d the price of a server down to 0 too even faster than it did, given the chance.<p>Microsoft was &quot;stagnant&quot; because they <i>could</i> be stagnant because they had <i>won</i>. The judgment at least prevented them from pushing home the advantage, because they knew they&#x27;d be slapped down. This is what I&#x27;m saying was probably the most important thing about it, and it&#x27;s easy not to see what &quot;didn&#x27;t happen&quot;, but I suspect that Microsoft would have done yet more &quot;evil&quot;. Perhaps it would have gone poorly, but it would have been foolishness for anybody to count on that. (What we know <i>now</i> about Microsoft and Ballmer&#x27;s leadership makes that a safer bet, probably, but we didn&#x27;t know that at the time!)<p>I think people look back at the world in which Microsoft was slapped, and see a world where bad things didn&#x27;t happen, and don&#x27;t realize that, due to second-order effects, there&#x27;s probably more relationship between those two things than they realize, even if obvious first-order effects are missing (like, Bill Gates never rent his clothes in twain on national TV going &quot;Woe are us, for we are injunction&#x27;ed!&quot;).

7732357,story,,,2,2,jtfairbank,"Ask HN: Client Side Caching Strategies?",,"I&#x27;m designing the interaction between our API and web client.  The two strategies I&#x27;ve come up with are:<p>1. A dumb API, which exposes objects pulled from the DB and results of server side calculations.  The client can cache the data itself, so that future requests can be built from the cached data instead of an API call.  The downsides are that more initial requests might be required to grab different datasets and the client has construct the requested data into a meaningful structure that the view can consume.  It also provides less opportunity to optimize individual API requests on the server, and perhaps there&#x27;d be some code duplication between the client and server.  The cached data would be relatively unstructured (lists of requested objects, segregated by type).<p><pre><code>    API -> get all states\n    API -> get all farms\n    Client -> combine the two into a list of Apple Farms by State\n    Client -> combine the two into a list of # of Farms in each State\n</code></pre>\n2. A smart API, which aims to answer questions asked by the client.  The client can cache specific requests but could not use the request data to build other requests from the cache because data might be missing.  However the server can optimize DB queries and provide structured data.  The cached data would be request results indexed by the API request parameters.<p><pre><code>    API -> get all Apple Farms by State\n    API -> get # of Farms in each State\n</code></pre>\nWe have a lot of base data that makes sense to request en-mass and cache locally (Strategy 1).  We also have some more specific data based on the results of user interaction, which would benefit most from the optimized queries that Strategy 2 provides.  In both cases we&#x27;d store the cache using local storage so it can persist across page loads.  A combination of the two is possible, but is more work and increases complexity.<p>I&#x27;d love some comments on each strategy, and any articles or personal experience about client side caching of API data.",1399898562

7732333,comment,7731619,7731619,2,0,emiller829,,,"Hi all. Arel committer here. This is a very cool application, and I really enjoyed attending (and helping answer questions) at Cameron&#x27;s RailsConf talk.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve become increasingly convinced that constructing queries with Arel is a fun exercise, but ultimately not terribly worthwhile for those of us who are just writing applications.<p>There are three reasons I can think of that people write their queries with Arel:<p>1. Construction of queries with a large list of predicates taking advantage of Enumerable#inject and Arel&#x27;s closure under composition without mucking about manipulating strings.<p>2. Unease about whether or not code is protected from SQL injections when written using more traditional methods.<p>3. Achieving database independence.<p>In the case of #1, there are some situations where this may make sense, as a convenience, however, there are ways to ensure data is properly quoted. Not least of these is using things like prepared statements or the pg gem&#x27;s &quot;exec_params&quot; method. This means that the goals of #1 and #2 can be met in an arguably more readable way by composing strings and param substitution.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s #3 that I regularly hear people advocate as the reason they write their queries in Arel. My problem with that is that database independence is a myth.<p>Oh, I don&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t write some subset of queries that will work on any database you like, nor that you can&#x27;t abstract away some of the differences on the surface of things like limiting result sets, pagination strategies, and so on. In fact, this is where Arel shines and a big part of why it&#x27;s being used by ActiveRecord in the first place.<p>But I don&#x27;t believe it makes much sense for typical app developers to attempt to write their queries in Arel in the attempt to achieve database-independence because most of the things that Arel can do for you in that regard are already exposed at the ActiveRecord level, with possible exception of the case-insensitive matching via ILIKE in PostgreSQL.<p>I&#x27;ve come to believe that database-independence is something you will only achieve if you aren&#x27;t doing anything interesting with your database, and you&#x27;re trying to treat it as a dumb data store. This is what ActiveRecord would prefer you do -- you see this guidance in things like validations, callbacks, and the like. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best of ideas.<p>Turns out that relational database management systems are really good at managing relational data, and to treat them as a dumb place to store your bits is to miss out on a lot of that power. Along with ORMs has come some degree of learned helplessness when it comes to the harnessing of that power.<p>So, before you write your next query in Arel, ask yourself whether or not you&#x27;re really gaining anything by doing so. It&#x27;s probable that the idea you&#x27;re trying to express would be more clearly and concisely expressed by showing the SQL you&#x27;re going to run.<p>Again, none of this is intended to take away from how cool this app is -- just don&#x27;t go replacing every single query in your app with Arel equivalents, okay?",1399898090

7732307,comment,7731624,7731624,6,0,brudgers,,,"[This is a sketch]<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve been thinking about <i>the act of writing</i> in a programming language as the act of writing. Which is to say I&#x27;ve been thinking about writing and wondering if it makes sense to think of programming as ontologically distinct. In other words, I&#x27;m wondering what it would be like if I were a lumper rather than a splitter.<p>As the push to toward greater &#x27;coding literacy&#x27; gains ground --in the anglopnone world, at least -- there will simply be more marginally literate code for the same reason there is more marginally literate writing as a result of seeking universal literacy. A goal of functional literacy tends to produce the functionally literate not a society in which everyone is a person of letters.<p>Programming as just another form of written communication suggests that perhaps programmers are being trained [programmed ?] in a manner that predisposes them toward inflexibility as writers [1]. Imagine if Creative Writing graduates entered the workplace believing that everything must be written in meter. Imagine, having to maintain iambic pentameter or extend a sonnet. As bad as that sounds, adding a protagonist to a blank verse epic is probably a closer analogy.<p>Programming as just another form of written communication suggests that its rise in the academy has encumbered the minds of &#x27;some people&#x27; with  values closer to those of literary theory than practical empiricism. There aren&#x27;t accepted 147 patterns for beam design. There are three - LFRD and SoM  and pure empiricism from tables. Civil engineers are trained to use apply them in order of increasing complexity because Civil engineering training values simple standard solutions not creative ones.<p>The difference between engineering training and creative writing training is that the engineering ideal is doing it right the first time, not progressive refinement toward the great American novel through iterative rewrites - and editing. An engineer learns when a fink or howe or warren truss is appropriate.  Civil engineering culture says &quot;it&#x27;s ok to solve simple problems&quot; not &quot;every problem is a prototype truss design problem.&quot; Treating every problem as the chance to create a snowflake is what the Creative Writing department does.<p>We can call programming &quot;software engineering&quot; or &quot;computer science&quot;, but it&#x27;s still pretty much just writing. What makes it unique is what makes all writing unique - the peculiarities of the audience and programs I will admit have some particularly peculiar members of their audience - computational devices whose peculiarity dictates certain conventions [keeping in mind that the goal of writing is effective communication].<p>What the article hits is that these conventions become stylized and that classically trained programmers fall into the practice of using style as a starting point.<p>Of course this is a sketch of an idea that&#x27;s kicking around in my head, and as I&#x27;ve written it I&#x27;ve got the impression that despite all the bigO one finds in computer science departments, the process of constructing software systems is pretty much entirely empirical. That&#x27;s why there is no SoM and LFRD - bigO is just the kernel of an SoM analog. What&#x27;s missing is time and experience which grounds the field in humanist values. It will take time before the idea that the bridge is built so that <i>people</i> can cross the river, becomes the obvious driving force.<p>[1] Not all mind you, or any necessarily. I&#x27;m just accepting the characterization in the article as fact.",1399897707

I see what you&#x27;re describing every time I take over a project.<p>The worst characteristic though is lack of version control.  Usually these teams will have used email to exchange source files.

And, usually each member of the team will have different versions of the code.<p>The second worst characteristic I find is code that doesn&#x27;t actually work unless it is placed exactly in the right directory of a now non-existent server.

Not everyone can effectively write complex code on that level, and it&#x27;s also an area where everyone has their own opinion on best practices or style.<p>Personally I often tend to write messy and &#x27;not best practice&#x27; code until I know what direction I&#x27;m headed in. Then I refactor. I recently turned a few hundred lines of if-statements into a sensibly organized piece of code.<p>But I think the problem here is bad software engineers. And I don&#x27;t think we should be apologists for poor coders (scientists or otherwise). If an organization accepts mediocre code from non software engineers, that&#x27;s fine and more power to them.

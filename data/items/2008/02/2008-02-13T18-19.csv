115077,comment,114501,115021,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"We are now into our second month with the service still running the same lisp process (which we've updated countless times with the REPL).  So far - 0 problems.  We have in place contingencies for going down by having realtime backup of our data so that if an instance were to crash, we could boot up another within a few minutes with no data loss.  In that case, we would email our customers with the direct ip address to login until the dns updates.  But I'm guessing this will be a very rare event.  So the worst case we are envisioning is about 5 minutes of downtime for our customer in a crash, unless all of Amazon goes down which I don't think has ever happened?<p>Given Amazon's extensive data center experience with their own products, I have a lot more trust that their service will stay up vs. a smaller hosting company.  And the worst case with them is minutes vs. hours or days with smaller providers.  (How many famous sites going down with smaller hosts have hit the news in the last 6 months...)<p>For Ubuntu, we're using:<p>Amazon EC2 Ubuntu 7.10 gutsy AMI built using code customized by

My linux experience was 0 when we started.  Now I can get done what I need to do - but my cofounder is the expert here and guided me on the commands I needed to work with the system.  We also set up ssh session that would directly get us in the cloud and then connect to the lisp instance in real time with the REPL through emacs, etc.<p>We basically had a local box in our office all set up first, and then when our internet connectivity in the office was insufficient, we put it on the cloud.  But since it is easy to play around with EC2 and start and stop instances, its probably just as easy to experiment on the cloud as you get things set up.",1202928986

One of your best tools in improving your page, however, is to test multiple versions at once and see which one converts better.<p>Moreover, anything you can do to reduce the number of steps and requirements for the user will also improve conversion.  For example, does your product really need them to confirm their password if they can have it emailed to them when they sign up or at any future time?  Try removing unnecessary form fields, or deferring them until after the user has signed up.<p>For reference, my most recent site (still in development) has the sign-up form on the front page, and we're able to convert 10-15% of random visitors from AdWords.  I feel like that's pretty good.  On another site, I struggled to get 8-10% overall conversion.  And, on a very simple project (<a href=""http://file.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://file.io</a>) that received a good number of hits from del.icio.us/popular  (very targeted/interested traffic), I was converting greater than 25%.<p>Just keep making it simpler, and keep testing, and you can improve your page.",1202928077

Now, especially if I'm in one of my three comfort places (bed, couch, or car), I know can fall asleep in 5 minutes or so.<p>Another key is DON'T try to sleep for more than 30 minutes.  The deeper you fall asleep, the harder it is to get up.  If I snooze my alarm even once for 10 minutes, I'm probably going to be too asleep to bother getting up when that 10 minutes is over.<p>The good news is that my experience (Steve Pavlina echoes this) is that once you train your body to work on the schedule, then even if you revert to a normal schedule, you can switch back to polyphasic sleep without having to go through the painful first week again.  Right now I sleep polyphasic 5-6 days a week and have 1-2 days a week where circumstances prevent me from napping during the day and I then take a full night's sleep at night.

Steve Pavlina's right, it's hard to integrate with the rest of the world (and he was self-employed with older children, and I work for the Man and have babies).  I write about it sometimes on my blog - it's less instructive as an ideal case compared to Pavlina, but probably more inline with what a normal person could expect.  I've got to say, if there's a lot of inflexible time requirements in life (day job, family, etc), polyphasic sleep is a great way to get some focus time to get in the zone.

And when the company sold, I was treated profoundly well. Did I get lucky? I don't know.

All of them had their equity positions spelled out on paper, and none of it meant anything, because VC liquidation preferences trump your peon shares.<p>Look, I'm not trying to be petulant.

If you know how to negotiate and you're valuable and you keep your eyes open, you'll do well.

I tried polyphasic for a while, but life is not setup for it, and you will be tired while trying to make the transitions- it takes an incredible amount of will power.<p>What I have found though is that you can sleep less at night if you take more naps during the day.  Whether everyone can make a full transition to polyphasic is unclear.  When I can manage, I sleep less than six hours at night and then take one or two 15 minute naps during the day.<p>Lucid dreaming is another approach to take to sleep- instead of avoiding sleep trying to be productive while sleeping.

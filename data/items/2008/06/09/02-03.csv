212468,comment,211782,211903,0,0,wensing,,,"The real reason I switched was because I began working at a newspaper, and Django and journalism are married/fused inextricably.  Choosing Pylons over Django in a news endeavor would be rather ... odd.<p>That aside, I said I progressed from Pylons to Django because I would choose Django if I had to do the Pylons project over again.  Why?  Because although I rejected (rebelled against?) it at the time, being 'forced' into an ORM for data entities would have been a really good thing.  Since Pylons ""lets"" you shirk an ORM, I did ... but the result feels more like PHP than Python.  Turns out Django's hand-holding is, in many cases, good because the answer they provide is the smart thing to do.  And doesn't that sound like a description of Python itself?<p>Would I choose an ORM-ified Pylons experience over Django?  Probably not.  Django routing seems better, there's Django-enhanced unit testing, and I even prefer the way Django forces you to keep Python out of your templates in favor of ""template tags"" and ""filters"".<p>Perhaps most importantly, Django has nearly-impeccable documentation, and a thriving community.",1212979813

Or perhaps to intentionally annoy certain people (religious zaelots and such). I just can't imagine JKR sitting at home, bitting her fingernails and thinking ""Damn, I am not politically correct enough .. I should really do something about it"".",1212979493

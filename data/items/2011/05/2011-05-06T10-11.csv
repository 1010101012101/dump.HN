2520596,comment,2517338,2519834,4,0,singular,,,"> You're paying a price for this speed: the Go compiler is single pass, which considerably cripples the language and imposes a lot of weird asymmetric features.<p>That's just not true - go is not single pass (as I understand it). There are separate passes performed for top-level types and code blocks, for example, and you can forward reference all you like.<p>Actually, I've made a couple contributions to the language so have played with the internal implementation, and in fact the parse is done in one pass, setting up internal representations of the types/names/etc. before type-checking of top-level types is performed <i>in a separate pass</i>, then variable assignments, then function bodies. I can't see how this is single-pass, e.g. src/cmd/gc/lex.c:238:-<p><pre><code>    // Process top-level declarations in three phases.
    // Phase 1: const, type, and names and types of funcs.
    //   This will gather all the information about types
    //   and methods but doesn't depend on any of it.
    // Phase 2: Variable assignments.
    //   To check interface assignments, depends on phase 1.
    // Phase 3: Function bodies.

Unless I'm missing the point - what is crippled and where are the weird asymmetric features?<p>One thing that go avoids is weird syntactic conflicts which require big lexer/parser hacks to work around. C# has quite a few of those, e.g. Foo<Bar<Baz>>> - that's emphatically <i>not</i> the same thing as a single-pass compiler.<p>Actually Rob has talked about this[1] and highlights dependency management as the most important factor.<p>I use C# in my day job and find the go compiler <i>considerably</i> quicker, incidentally.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/pike-google-go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/pike-google-go</a>",1304678879

There's a social state, which a bunch of American's think is a really bad idea but which I, and a lot of my sovereign state, happen to think is pretty nifty.<p>So before you start saying that the sovereignty of your nation is really only important to your sovereign, take a look at all the people in England who love being English, France, who love being French, Iranians, who love being Iranian, Indians, who love being Indian, Chinese, who love being Chinese, Russians, who love being Russians. You get the idea.<p>I personally think you and reality are very far divorced in your views of sovereignty. A lot of people like it.",1304677261

Paying in small amounts of CPU time (that have worth, but don't <i>feel</i> like they do) could get around that.<p>(Note that, even if this were implemented, you probably wouldn't be doing the work <i>in</i> the browser, but rather just spending (fractions of) coins you had already generated and placed into your bitcoin wallet. Thus, this wouldn't <i>slow down</i> spammersas they could just buy coins on the open marketit would just make the marginal cost of a single spam transaction more (and hopefully prohibitively) expensive. On the bright side, even if it happened that Bitcoins were too comparatively-devalued to prevent spam, spammers would then, by buying Bitcoins en masse, become the de-facto Bitcoin-to-USD exchange!)",1304676379

But then those people wouldn&#x27;t be buying stuff on line anyway. But the Genius Bar is a service that doesn&#x27;t cost anything and might not even end with you paying anything. And even if you do end up paying/buying... Apple stores still take cash right? Requiring that you give them a credit card just to talk with someone does not sound like the Apple way.<p>EDIT (to answer the above EDIT 2): Both would be effective and easy for Apple to do if they cared. Although, requiring an Apple ID could be problematic for a person who doesn&#x27;t have one, right? Admittedly, I&#x27;m not an Apple consumer myself so I don&#x27;t really know what is involved in getting an Apple ID or why a non-user would need a Genius Bar appointment.",1375390789

6143491,comment,6143310,6143362,3,0,droithomme,,,"I own a pressure cooker. I used it for cooking. Not only is it legal to own a pressure cooker, hundreds of thousands of americans, and tens of millions of people world wide, own and use these devices. They are particularly useful for reducing the cook time of long cooking dishes like stews, and are also necessary for proper sterilization of canned foods which are not acidic enough to be safe from normal immersion bath sealing. No license or ID or special training is needed to purchase or operate a pressure cooker.<p>I also have a fairly good sized box of leftover fireworks and firecrackers. These are also legal and normal to own, and many millions of americans have purchased said items. There are fireworks stands in parking lots and gas stations during the summer, and there are fireworks warehouses that sell items in bulk. No license, ID or special training is generally required to purchase or operate fireworks in the states where they are legal. Some areas they are banned because of the fire hazard, some areas have age purchase restrictions that require ID.<p>If I did put a photo of my pressure cooker, and my fireworks, on a facebook feed, I do not agree that that would be probable cause to search my house, or even to ask to do so (which is absolutely not a normal and routine interaction with law enforcement), nor would it be a reasonable use of taxpayer money to send a team out to investigate.",1375390725

If they have to repeatedly export/import their data manually to have the chart data update it&#x27;ll seem like a chore.<p>Compare this to connecting to a customer&#x27;s database directly. You can refresh your (cached) chart data on your own schedule and the customer doesn&#x27;t need to be involved at all.<p>Oh and if anyone is thinking, &quot;Yeah but I can schedule a cron job to extract the CSV file and publish it every X minutes&quot;, yes you <i>could</i> do that but again that&#x27;s work for the customer.

In a perfectly competitive equilibrium market, you&#x27;re right, producers are price takers. But we&#x27;re not talking about wheat farming. When we&#x27;re talking about the introduction of new products, etc, we&#x27;re necessarily talking about markets that aren&#x27;t in their long-term equilibrium. Such markets are where all the money is made. E.g. today, the CD drive market is probably in its long-run equilibrium and highly competitive, and there is no profit to be made producing CD drives. But it was a highly lucrative product for Sony when the technology was first introduced. In these contexts, producers do have a certain amount of pricing power, and can extract positive profits as a result. Moreover, even in perfectly competitive markets, where costs are irrelevant to prices, costs are relevant to companies&#x27; decisions about whether to engage in R&D. If the market dynamics are such that prices approach marginal cost, there is very little incentive to engage in R&D, because it won&#x27;t be profitable.<p>As a concrete example, say you&#x27;re ARM and contemplating investing $1 billion to put a new quad-core 3 GHz 1W CPU on the market. Because this a new product, you have a certain amount of pricing power to begin with. That pricing power allows you to extract positive economic profits, at least until your design is copied and the market becomes highly competitive. For the whole exercise to be worth while, you have to recoup that $1 billion in R&D before the market becomes competitive and prices approach marginal costs of production. If your Chinese competitor can copy your design for $100 million in 6 months, they have a huge advantage. At that point both companies will together likely still have a lot of pricing power, but because your competitor had much lower R&D costs to get the same product, he can undercut you o price and still recoup his lower R&D expense. In that sort of market, the profitable strategy is to copy, not to do original R&D.",1375390577

Those people have no understanding of odds), and in the shadow of Boston felt that this was a critical thing to tell the police about. The police pretty much have to follow up on all such things, so they go and talk to them, again in the shadow of the Boston bombings, asking about Boston bombing type things (because street-level law enforcement is often looking backwards, assuming the same crimes are the new norm).<p>Yes, a picture of fireworks <i>absolutely</i> explains why they would ask about a pressure cooker. Whether she had previously been looking up pressure cookers or backpacks (if that is actually true at all) almost certainly has nothing to do with this, but she knew where to go with it for maximum interest.",1375390509

We take raw data about Movies, Music, Sports, Economics, Politics and more and make it possible for regular people to analyze and extract useful information from it. We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.<p>While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.<p>Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.<p>1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, &quot;there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things&quot; is spot on. Whenever you&#x27;re browsing the web, you&#x27;re constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You&#x27;re a pragmatist who&#x27;s ok with ignoring IE6 users. You&#x27;ve built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead. Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You&#x27;re a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You&#x27;re ready to join an extremely talented product & engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we&#x27;re working on sounds intriguing, then we&#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

A load miss will stall an in-order machine.<p>Load misses are of two kinds: where the load result is a data-flow ancestor of all the rest of the program, and when the load is incidental to the program dataflow. In the former case neither in-order nor out-of-order machines can do anything but wait for memory. An example is making random references into a hash table that is bigger than cache - every machine of every architecture is going to run at DRAM speed.<p>However, there are also incidental misses, where the program has other things to do that do not require the result from the load miss. For these, the OOO machine can keep going, while an in-order machine stalls.<p>The Mill does not face this issue. It is an in-order machine, yet does not suffer from miss stalls, or at least not from unnecessary ones. In general, the Mill avoids all the misses that an OOO can avoid. Or roughly so - there are a few cases where the Mill stalls but an OOO doesn&#x27;t, and a few where the OOO stalls but the Mill doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s roughly a wash.<p>Most of how this works will be described in the next presentation (#3) in the series, although some won&#x27;t be until a later presentation.",1375389483

In terms of fab yield (which is the cost driver) they do not, because caches are regular structures that are built with built-in sparing.<p>If there&#x27;s a bad gate in the cache then the fab process simply uses one of the spare cells inside; the user never realizes that a spare has been used. If there&#x27;s a bad gate in the core proper then that chip is gone, lowering the fab yield.<p>The same can be done at the level of other regular structures. Your two-core chip is really a four-core chip with a couple of bad cores. That&#x27;s one of the reasons why the vendors are so eager to convince you that multicore is the Pearly Gates - it increases their effective yield.
Re cache area:<p>To a first approximation, power cost of a cache is constant independent of size, whereas core power is superlinear. Consequently the limiting factor for increasing cache size is latency, not power.

ME output (specializer input) is a complete CFG and DFG for the abstract Mill. The specializer first replaces operations that are not present on the target with calls to functions; on a Mill function call is semantically equivalent to an op like an add.<p>There is no instruction-selection phase. The Mill in general has only one way to implement any given source-level action, and the correct (abstract) code has already been selected by the ME. The BE does instruction scheduling, introducing spill where necessary, using standard schedule algorithms long used for in-order machines and VLIWs. The result may be listed as assembler source or emitted as binary. The schedule algorithms have quadratic worst case but in practice are linear. The generated binaries are cached in the load module, so subsequent runs skip the specializer step.<p>Current status is that work on the new (LLVM-based) compiler is on hold while we complete the patent filings, and the old one is out of date already.

DCT has uniform frequency resolution, which sounds desirable but isn&#x27;t once you start quantizing due to ringing, etc. See slide 25 or so of [1]. Wavelets overcome this problem by adapting the resolution in opposite ways at the extremes. This works fantastic for medium signal rates, but can have severe low passing at low rates. For low rate coding DCT with the bells and whistles (deblocking, etc) will typically win.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/pubs/lca2012/auckland/intro_to_video1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/pubs/lca2012/auckland/intro...</a>",1375388459

This approach helped keep bugs out of the code.<p>The &quot;pentium gcc&quot; (Cygnus/egcs) group was quickly responding to marketplace needs.  It was more bazaar-like.  It committed code more freely than Gnu would - and the code while allowing for new functions was not always that well architected.<p>So what was the deal with this schism and then subsequent merger which happened?  What happened was egcs (the Cygnus-oriented one, the &quot;pentium gcc&quot; one) began eclipsing gcc.  Toward the end it <i>really</i> began eclipsing gcc.  It was not as solid as gcc, but it had all the new functionality people wanted.  All over, people were seriously about to abandon gcc and go with egcs.  At this point Stallman threw up his hands and accepted that the egcs approach had won.  They merged, and gcc became more liberal about what code it would commit, at the expense of being a solid code base.  Just like the OP says.<p>So now what is different this time around?  Why is a compiler which prioritizes stability and correctness over new functionality and optimizations going to win?  The latter approach won last time around, why should the first approach win this time?  Especially since in battles between cathedral/waterfall projects and bazaar/agile projects, the bazaar/agile approach seems to come out on top again and again.  OpenBSD can afford to go this route if it wants because OpenBSD fills a marginal niche.  It might even be interesting to watch OpenBSD go down this road.  But for more mainstream OS&#x27;s like Linux, this approach might not be possible.<p>And if anyone mentions Apple - Apple is not marginal, but it is a niche.  GCC and Linux are in a multitude of environments.  A company like Apple with its own ecosystem and only a handful of targets can afford to pick and choose its compiler.",1375387203

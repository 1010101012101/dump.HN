It's not doing everything using asynchronous I/O as you would expect. Node.js uses a thread pool for things like DNS resolution and disk I/O.

5766788,comment,5766191,5766387,6,0,jules,,,"Another way to derive the bell curve is as the maximum entropy distribution with known mean and variance.<p>The derivation does require one trick that is usually not taught in high school. You know how you can maximize a function by setting its derivative to zero? Well, there is a generalization of that to functions of multiple variables: you set the gradient to zero. But there is yet another generalization to that for functions of continuously infinite number of variables! That's called the calculus of variations. If we want to maximize the entropy over all possible probability distributions over the real numbers, then we have a continuously infinite number of variables, since for each real number x, we need to assign a probability mass p(x). Here is the derivation for those interested:<p>Let m be the mean we want and v be the variance we want, and let p(x) be the probability density function.<p>We want to maximize the entropy S = int(p(x)log(p(x))) given the constraints that:<p><pre><code>    int(p(x)) = 1  // total probability should sum to 1\n    E(X) = int(x*p(x)) = m  // mean should be m\n    E((X-m)^2) = int((x-m)^2*p(x)) = v  // variance should be v\n</code></pre>\nThis problem can be solved with calculus of variations with Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is all the terms inside the integrals summed up:<p><pre><code>    L = p*log(p) + a*p + b*x*p + c*(x-m)^2*p\n</code></pre>\nCalculus of variations tells us that for the optimal p, we have:<p><pre><code>    dL/dp = 0\n</code></pre>\nThis is the analogue of setting the derivative to zero for maximizing a function.<p>Calculating that we get:<p><pre><code>    a + bx + c(x-m)^2 + log p + 1 = 0\n</code></pre>\nrewriting:<p><pre><code>    p = e^-(a + bx + c(x-m)^2 + 1)\n</code></pre>\nWe have the general form of the Bell curve. Now we just need to find the right values for a,b,c to satisfy the 3 constraints.<p>As special cases of this we have:<p>1) The probability distribution with maximum entropy without constraints is the uniform distribution.<p>2) The probability distribution with maximum entropy with only the constraint that the mean is m, is the exponential distribution.<p>In general if you want to find maximum entropy distribution with known expectation values E(f(X)) and E(g(X)), then that is of this form:<p><pre><code>    p(x) = C*e^(a*f(x) + b*g(x))\n</code></pre>\nThis gives an indication why so many distributions have this form. For example the entire exponential family can also be derived as maximum entropy distributions with certain known expectation values.<p>Of course this derivation is only a good motivation for the bell curve if you already cared about entropy, mean and variance.",1369474093

I dô not know what my aim in life is. I have been thinking hard but I can't seem to pick one. I can rule out some, but I can't rule them out completely.<p>Family: I have little interest in starting a family. Where I live, overpopulation is a problem. I don't like driving. There isn't even enough place to park cars. Why does everyone have to buy a car?<p>Money: I have little interest in making a lot of money. Growing up, my family had enough money, but I saw how my parents really didn't have time for much else than making moey.<p>Name, Fame and acceptance: I think about this sometimes. My college peers are apparently well settled. Higher up in the job/salary/business/family heirarchy than I can hope reaching in my lifetime. Makes me sad a little thinking they must be looking down on me, but then I realise that it doesn't realy matter. I wouldn't have been happier if I had made the choices that they did in life and I wouldn't be happy chasing success just because I can have acceptance from my peers. Because all of us are individuals with separate lives. But all in all comparing myself to my peers makes me unhappy transiently, even when I know that I don't hate their success and being happy for them makes me happy.<p>Happiness: Sometimes I can pinpoint what makes me happy. Like when I am working on a hobby application,which turns out better than I expected. Or when I find a smarter way to implment a certain feature. Other times it is not that easy to say what makes me happy. Building something so I can be the next facebook or tumblr doesn't make me happy. Perhaps because I know that it is impossible.<p>A lot of the happiness problems is because of the need for social acceptance. I don't grudge my peers their success, but sometimes you feel the eyes of society scurutinizing you and judging you as a failure and that is what makes me unhappy, but only transiently. Because, I know that what society thinks about me is not that important. For eg. Currently it is important enough for me to be posting anonymously online, but not important enough to make me decide what I want to do in life.<p>But eventually thinking about the meaning of life does not lead to answers. Perhaps it is a difficult thing to understand. Or perhaps everyone else has it right and I am afraid of trying and losing.<p>I understand that the biological reason of life is procreation. But I understand little else. So I generally try to live in the present and try to save some money so I don't become a slave to my current job and eventually hope to be self employed, make enough money, not hurt others and maybe help others a little.",1369473931

We do zero-downtime deploys thanks to the cluster module, which also keeps workers running (I haven't seen an unhandled error take down a worker in a while, but as with most any stack you need to be pretty vigilant about your error handling). At over 3K api requests per second to a single box, we hover at around 0.05 load (our machines range from e3-1230 to dual 2620s, so it's hard to get an exact number). When asked to handle more request, the impact on load is pretty linear.<p>We're also dealing with servers in 4 different locations and some requests need to be proxied to a central location. With a ~300ms round trip from Singapore to Washington, Node's asynchronous nature has been a win when it comes to handling concurrency in the face of backend latency.",1369473319

I even did a Bachelors paper on this subject (in combination with FOSS) and studied the amount of savings it would lead to if implemented for high school education.<p>Additionally, I graduated with a BA in 2011 and the entire process felt archaic to me, filled with wasted time, and more importantly costing lots of my hard-earned money. The only way I was able to get the degree was with help of family and by taking CLEP tests for over 70 hours. (rougly equivalent to 23 courses), the CLEP tests only costed in total around $500, and allowed me to skip 2 years of study. (so if anyone hasnt heard of CLEP and is low on funds and wants to get a degree I would highly recommend them :)<p>I'm definately going to look into this in more detail though, getting a Masters would be nice and if all it costed was $6,600 for the 2 years (and study was remote) I think i'd be able to manage it as a full-time developer with a family.",1369473291

They lack almost any control, and use statistical methods that would make psychologists wince. Hypothesis testing is rare to the point of nonexistance. (Psychology sometimes adjusts too far in the other direction, using complex analyses where a simpler one would do.)<p>Further, experiments are nearly never replicable, at all, because the systems evaluated are never made public, or the experimental environment is never recorded.

This misperception may originate with the idea that manned aircraft generally must stay at least 500 feet above the ground.<p>- There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations. Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft—manned or unmanned—in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval. Private sector (civil) users can obtain an experimental airworthiness certificate to conduct research and development, training and flight demonstrations. Commercial UAS operations are limited and require the operator to have certified aircraft and pilots, as well as operating approval. ... The FAA reviews and approves UAS operations over densely-populated areas on a case-by-case basis.<p>- In the 2012 FAA reauthorization legislation, Congress told the FAA to come up with a plan for &#x27;safe integration&#x27; of UAS by September 30, 2015. Safe integration will be incremental.<p>So don&#x27;t get too excited your drones won&#x27;t be taking the skies anytime soon.",1394218010

I further did not state that your old post claimed these things: I only stated that your old post pointed out the seeding limitation of /dev/urandom. I continue to not see why you keep stating that. Nothing I have said, either explicitly or implicitly, claims that when /dev/urandom &quot;runs out of entropy&quot; it causes a problem: I would never claim that, as even if I thought I believed that (and I do not) I do not consider myself qualified to say that (hence why I rely on arguments from practicality only).",1394217811

I&#x27;ve experimented with no slides, minimalist slides, and text-heavy slides.<p>Young whippersnappers don&#x27;t seem to know how to take notes--so going with no slides is tough. Students cannot go back and review the lecture to make sure they understood key points. I&#x27;ll use this method for teaching skills--e.g. calculating NPV in Excel--but not for introducing terms & definitions.<p>When I&#x27;ve used minimalist slides, I get a bunch of students complaining that there isn&#x27;t enough detail. I think the lectures are more entertaining and engaging, personally, but for students who want to be able to review the material in preparation for an exam, minimalist slides aren&#x27;t the best. Think about your average Discovery channel show. The shows are interesting and engaging, but if you had to explain everything to a friend later on, or had to take an exam on the material presented, how would you do? Without watching the whole thing over again, it would be hard to absorb all of the material.<p>I hate delivering the text-heavy slides to classes--I often want to skip over some points based on the flow of the lesson, but the doing so might cause confusion later on. Students will ask if they have to know that stuff for the exam.<p>Anyway, they key takeaway for me is to listen to the students and adjust to what they prefer, but not to ignore well-studied pedagogical best practices.",1394217151

A bricycle is essentially a\nbicycle with springy training wheels. The stiﬀness of the training wheel suspension\ncan be varied from inﬁnite, when the bricycle is a tricycle, to zero, when it is a bicycle.\nOne might expect a smooth transition from tricycle to bicycle as the stiﬀness is\nvaried, in terms of handling, balance and feel. But the situation is more complicated.\nRather, the controllability of a bicycle depends on gravity. Without gravity, lean\nand direction cannot be controlled independently. Springy training wheels eﬀectively\nreduce or even negate gravity. Indeed, experiments with the bricycle show problems\nwhen the total eﬀective gravity is about zero. People can then still balance easily\nbut can no longer turn the brike. The theory and experiment show a qualitative\ndiﬀerence between bicycles and tricycles. A diﬀerence that cannot be met halfway.<p>Related:\n<a href=""http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/bicycle_mechanics/overview.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/bicycle_mechani...</a>",1394216262

Here are some of the different types of Powerpoints I have experience with:<p>The Public Speaking: Should be a few words, a picture, a quote...basically what this presentation advocates for.  Very minimalist.  The focus should be on what the presenter is saying.<p>The Pitch Deck: In my opinion, a startup pitch deck should be very minimalist, but should be enough for someone to understand the pitch.  Often investors ask me for pitch decks before a meeting.  If there&#x27;s only 3 words per slide, lots of valuable content might be missed.  I still never have more than 3 bullet points per slide.<p>The Consulting Deck:  When I worked for a big 3 management consulting firm, we used decks to present all of our information.  It was much more technical and in depth, and it needed to stand alone in case a CEO wanted to read the study two years down the line.  Many times it would have multiple graphs or infographics, and several bullet points.  The top right would have a tracker saying which part of the presentation we were in, and the title would be a tagline which states the takeaway from the slide.  This type of deck would never be presented to a large public audience, but rather around a table with a few stakeholders with in-depth subject matter knowledge.<p>Clearly there are different types of powerpoints for different situations.  My best professors did notes by hand, rather than try to put everything on a powerpoint.<p>The most important rule that holds true to all Powerpoints, in my humble opinion, is <i>one point/takeaway per slide.</i><p>Too many people use powerpoints as a crutch rather than a tool, and it gives the slideshow a bad name.",1394215996

It doesn&#x27;t make a clear definition. It was written in 1981, so it may assume small, radio controlled, line of sight, limited capabilities, flown as a hobby, and perhaps imitating &quot;real&quot; aircraft; this is what model aircraft were then. However, it doesn&#x27;t define anything in particular.<p>In Federal Register Notice 14 CFR Part 91 (<a href=""http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/reg/media/frnotice_...</a>), they attempt some clarification, adding a line about &quot;expecting line of sight&quot; control, and leaning heavily on the &quot;hobby&quot; part as a clear distinction.  This ruling kinda makes a hash of that, leaving undefined physical characteristics.<p>So in general it&#x27;s fairly unclear. Another result of technology moving well faster than the speed of government. The FAA notes at the end of the CFR that it may in the future issue an authorization for unmanned vehicle &quot;operations which do not qualify as sport and recreation, but also may not require a certificate of airworthiness&quot;. They may be encouraged to do this faster now.<p>(The fact that the clarification is in a policy notice is a major part of the ruling discussed here.

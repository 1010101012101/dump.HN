10711635,comment,10710594,10710594,0,0,JonAtkinson,,,"As another poster points out, there aren&#x27;t a lot of CMS-related posts on HN, but I&#x27;d like to share a little of our experience with Django CMS.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Django CMS since early in the 2.x releases (the earliest Django CMS site I still have the code for was using 2.1.0.beta2), and since then we have developed approximately 80 Django CMS sites; with traffic ranging from a few hundred hits a month, to our largest which serves a few hundred thousand hits per day across three languages.<p>In all this time, I still haven&#x27;t found a compelling reason to switch to anything else. Django CMS&#x27;s most powerful feature is that it&#x27;s just plain old Django. This means that it&#x27;s rare we can&#x27;t use the CMS as a base framework for a site, and then plug custom applications into the site tree as necessary. Certainly few of our clients have needs which are exotic enough where this pattern breaks down. Yes, this requires a certain amount of learning curve, but it&#x27;s not insurmountable at all, and I think it&#x27;s conceptually simpler than most other CMSes out there (I&#x27;ve been an agency-side web developer for 15 years, and I still can&#x27;t figure out how some people mangle the Wordpress page loop).<p>I was concerned early in the 3.x cycle when front-end editing was introduced (and I believe the introduction was mishandled by the development team), but recent releases have polished this to a level where I can ship it to clients with confidence. This week we launched a new site using 3.2, and content wizards, in particular, are a powerful addition (will these be made multi-step in the future? It would be nice from a UI point of view).<p>The CMS in general is in good hands, though I do worry that without strong community leadership, it might move too far towards being &#x27;the platform which powers Aldryn&#x27;, rather than a strong stand-alone CMS. Maybe that&#x27;s too negative, but I do see it as a risk.<p>5 years ago I made a bet on Django CMS, and it turned out good, so I&#x27;m happy. Maybe it&#x27;ll serve the next 5 years.",1449766493

Major updates in Plone 5:<p>* completely new user interface for content managers\n* updated accessibility, mobilized themes, etc\n* content types can now be created via the web using the Dexterity. \n* the Diazo theming system makes customizing the look of Plone real easy via the web\n* Deco allows you to customize the layout of pages via the web. While Deco is still an add-on, it is ready for production use, and will be included by default in Plone in the future.<p>While Dexterity, Diazo and Deco all can be used via the web, you can export anything created via the web to the file system. If desired this allows you to quickly prototype work with the active involvement of content managers and designers, then bring the project under file system version control and add more advanced features via programming.<p>None of these technologies are new. The plone community has been working on them for much of the last 5 years, and they were available as options or add-ons to Plone 4.

Is an atheist sinful by definition?<p>It is completely possible to be good and not a Christian. It is completely possible to be a Christian that is a worse person than an atheist. There is actually a <i>lot</i> of confusion around this point, even among Christians. A lot of the problem centers around what &quot;Christian&quot; means. It could mean:<p>1) Someone who feels like they&#x27;re a Christian. Even Richard Dawkins considers himself a &quot;secular Christian&quot; (a). He doesn&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s going to heaven or doing God&#x27;s will on Earth.<p>2) Someone who Christ will admit into heaven when they die.<p>3) Someone who strives to follow Christ&#x27;s teachings on this Earth.<p>For the purposes of this conversation, it sounds like you&#x27;re asking about #2 (feel free to clarify if I&#x27;m making the wrong assumption here).<p>As far as that goes, gjm11 gets some elements right but seems to miss the mark for some reason. The Bible is very clear on this point. Salvation is given to people by God, through Christ. Period (b). We are supposed to have faith that He will be fair about granting eternal life. If you don&#x27;t believe God is fair or that the Bible is true, then I suppose what the Bible teaches on this point is not interesting.<p>So what does God want from us? To trust Him, believe in Him, and have faith that He will take care of everything (c). It&#x27;s hard to see how an atheist can have this perspective. It seems impossible to me.<p>How does this relate to being a &quot;good person&quot;? Well, eternal life is supposed to be the default state of things, but when we reject God and His teachings, we accept responsibility for our own eternity (d), and I certainly can&#x27;t make myself live forever. When we are &quot;bad people&quot;, it should be extremely obvious that we are rejecting God (e).<p>So while some of us may be good, or even great, people, all of us have rejected God on some level and blown our chances to enjoy entrance into heaven on our own merits (f). Christians who think they&#x27;re &quot;better people&quot; than atheists need to re-examine the Bible and work on that part of themselves (g1) (g2).<p>On to the next question:<p>> ...but it seems strange to me that early Christians would be required to submit to a government that is persecuting those that attempt to obey God, for attempting to obey God.<p>It <i>is</i> strange from many perspectives. The Bible actually says that (h).<p>Anyway, Daniel (i) is a great book to read for an example of how to both obey God and submit to oppressive rulers. At times, Daniel and his friends would ask politely for exceptions from rules that would cause them to disobey God&#x27;s commands (j). When that was not possible, Daniel and his friends would respectfully refuse and accept the consequences, even if that meant death (k) (l). That seems pretty harsh, but if you have faith that the all-powerful God is good and that He&#x27;s watching you, all sorts of things are possible, even a peaceful death under persecution (m).<p>In certain ways, the physical world is the Matrix to someone with strong faith in God. When you have guaranteed salvation and are following the commands of an all-powerful God, you don&#x27;t have to dodge bullets. You <i>don&#x27;t have to</i>.<p>I realize that sounds silly to many, but it&#x27;s what the Bible teaches.<p>(a) <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10853648/Richard-Dawkins-I-am-a-secular-Christian.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10853648/Ric...</a><p>(b) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14:6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14:6</a><p>(c) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&ver...</a><p>(d) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&v...</a><p>(e) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:27</a><p>(f) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-27&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-27...</a><p>(g1) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A12-17&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A1...</a><p>(g2) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8...</a><p>(h) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+14%3A12&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+14%3A1...</a><p>(i) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%201"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%201</a><p>(j) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1%3A8-21&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1%3A8-21...</a><p>(k) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203&vers...</a><p>(l) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206&vers...</a><p>(m) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7%3A54-60&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7%3A54-60&...</a>",1449765305

It&#x27;s worth checking the project&#x27;s policies and behaviors, to make sure it isn&#x27;t doing anything that provides some kind of bias, but simply starting out by claiming that Rust is &quot;anti-female&quot; goes a bit far.<p>A few things that I can think of off the top of my head:<p>Some of the prominent contributions from women don&#x27;t show up in the list of contributors because they are not directly to the compiler and standard library which are what are tracked in this contributor list, but rather to the broader ecosystem. Julia Evans has written some good blog posts on writing an OS in Rust, that have inspired other people in this space: <a href=""http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/12/the-rust-os-story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/12/the-rust-os-story/</a>. Emily Dunham does some excellent work on Rust infrastructure: <a href=""http://edunham.net/2015/05/20/open_infrastructure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edunham.net/2015/05/20/open_infrastructure.html</a> There are of course many more that I&#x27;m not listing here, but the point is that the Rust community, and even the upstream project, consist of more than just the compiler and standard library, though those contributors are the ones that get credited in a release since that is what is being released.<p>Rust is still a nascent language; while it is starting to gain traction in the industry, it is not yet broadly adopted, and thus investing a lot of time and energy in joining the project is still a bit of a risk. People who have more social capital and more free time can afford to spend more of that on projects like Rust with a lot of potential but a higher amount of risk. Unfortunately, in our society men tend to have both more social capital, and more free time as domestic labor and child rearing is still seen as primarily women&#x27;s work.<p>There are probably a large number of other factors at play. The Rust community that I have seen has been very supportive of women contributing, and has been doing a better job recently of outreach, but there is still probably more that can be done.<p>Can you provide any suggestions; any place you see the project structure, or contributors, being &quot;anti-female&quot;, or any positive action that could be done to increase outreach or increase participation?",1449765117

It&#x27;s not lightweight or ops-friendly.<p>So for our own stuff, we built a single pluggable collector that simply emits text files (scheduled via cron), and uses prometheus-node-exporter&#x27;s &quot;textfile directory&quot; support to export the data. It&#x27;s not ideal.<p>And since it&#x27;s a kind of mini-framework itself, that doesn&#x27;t follow any community-defined plugin system, we can&#x27;t easily open-source the bits we think would be useful to others (we have some nice metrics for RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, etc.) because people would have to buy into our little plugin system.<p>I&#x27;d much rather that the exporter was pluggable, and was capable of spawning subprocesses.<p>Prometheus also works very poorly/not at all with existing web frameworks such as Ruby&#x27;s Unicorn and Node.js&#x27;s cluster module, where there isn&#x27;t a single process that can track metrics.

Any student that was a minority in their class received a minor bonus as an incentive. The initiative was however deemed a failure when it was realized that the majority of student fulfilling the requirement was men and not women. Afterward it was sent to the courts which promptly declared the initiative as discriminative against students who weren&#x27;t minorities. Now only a short time ago a new initiative was suggested by a government study, with the primary difference from the old one being that it will now only apply in studies where men are the majority.<p>So excuse me for having a hard time finding those old-school feminists that talks about equal rights.

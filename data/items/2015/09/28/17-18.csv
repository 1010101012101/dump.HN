That said, I think the Apple Watch&#x27;s battery life has proven to be better than advertised (~2 full days for me before it gets critically low, better than the ~1 day advertised) so there&#x27;s definitely some room to play there.<p>I also picked up a Pebble Time Steel, and have been mildly disappointed. It definitely lasts longer than the Apple Watch, but the margin is not nearly as wide as you&#x27;d hope. The marketing copy says ~7 days, but in reality it&#x27;s been more like ~4 days, and between the Apple Watch @ 2 day battery life vs. Pebble @ 4 day battery life, I know which I&#x27;d pick.",1443462951

The 360 looks like a traditional watch, and the Apple Watch looks far bigger[0], and unusual. Have you seen them in real life? We have people in the building who own the 360 and others with the Apple Watch, I see them daily. The Apple Watch stands out as being a &quot;box on the wrist&quot; the 360 is invisible unless brought up or shown off.<p>> However there are a number of innovations e.g. digital crown, force touch, haptic feedback and the excellent Fitness capabilities that do put in far ahead of the competition in day to day usability.<p>This is so typical of Apple fans. Ignore everything on the market then claim Apple innovated/created every major product feature. Almost everything on your list pre-existed ahead of the Apple Watch announcement (let alone launch).<p>The crown is a watch feature which is over fifty years old. It has appeared on digital watches for at least twenty years before Apple &quot;invented it.&quot; I myself owned a digital watch in the mid 1990s with a crown (which allowed you to set the time, change the date, etc all on a completely digital watch).<p>Apple was not the first watch to contain a vibrator (&quot;haptic feedback&quot;), IBM and Citizen Watch created the horrifying &quot;WatchPad&quot; in 2000(!) which had it. Since then many (most?) smartwatches have contained it as standard. It is absurd to call it an Apple innovation for a product released in 2015.<p>It is laughable to point at the fitness stuff. Even stepping away from smartwatches for a second, there is an entire market of fitness trackers around, many of which have incredible usability and are extremely popular. Fitbit, Garmin, iFit, heck even Microsoft have been producing products in this field for literally years ahead. Then there is the smartwatch competition from Samsung, LG, Garmin, Moto, etc all have fitness tracking capabilities.<p>It is like you either haven&#x27;t been following technology at all or are just trolling. There&#x27;s no other explanation for anyone claiming that Apple &quot;innovated&quot; most of the stuff on your list. I half expected you to claim that Apple invented the LCD screen on a smartwatch, or the wrist strap, it would be no more absurd than your other claims...<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.modernhoot.com/372/moto-360-and-apple-watch-side-by-side/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.modernhoot.com/372/moto-360-and-apple-watch-side-...</a>",1443462937

These wireless chargers will necessarily be able to provide substantially more power than a typical wired charger. A typical wired charger is 10kW or less, while highway inductive charging will need to provide 20-30kW just to sustain highway speeds.<p>Let&#x27;s say you draw 30kW no matter what until the battery is full.

I held the commencement speech for new students at university, in front of thousands and a TV crew, and everyone wondered how I was able to keep so calm. And I went around participating in political school debates during the election my senior year of high school and couldn&#x27;t care less that there were audiences of hundreds of rowdy teenagers.<p>The thing is, one of the things that is stressful to me about social situations is that I have to work to read the situations, and work to ensure I respond &quot;correctly&quot;, and work to engage in chitchat and all the other stuff that creates social bonds, and that I tend to overly negatively interpret social reactions.<p>To stay calm when speaking to large groups, on the other hand, is then very easy: I just don&#x27;t invest the effort in dealing with the social stuff. It never hits me that it&#x27;s something worth being nervous about, because I&#x27;ve just &quot;switched off&quot;, and worry about whatever subject I&#x27;ll be talking about, which I&#x27;m generally certain about, not least because I have a very easy time learning a manuscript, and I know I&#x27;m effectively insulated from everything that makes close social situations exhausting.<p>I strongly believe that introversion in social settings and ability to speak to groups are affected by very different things.<p>Like you I&#x27;m also usually fine with <i>working</i> in groups, for the same reasons: There&#x27;s usually not that many social cues to worry about, and when they are, they tend to be more focused and less effort to deal with, at least for some time.",1443462922

This is largely because you generally only take so much risk with ongoing collection efforts, for example going through customs and attending official diplomatic functions (dinners etc...) under status is typical and gives the locals a record. What they do in their &quot;off time&quot; is the real collection work, but even then their chance of gaining access to well placed contacts that have very specialized intelligence is low. The majority of officers know this, and it ends up being a political dance, where if someone gets too risky with their collection they get tagged and persona-non-grata&#x27;d.<p>The real question here is why the Soviets decided at that time to burn the officers that it knew about - because that turns into a tit-for-tat across waters that eats up resources and really strains diplomatic relations. I think the answer is very clear in that it was the last gasp of a dying system, so they were doing what they could to purge and wrest power.<p>Nothing particularly shocking or complicated here if you know how the system works.",1443461416

I would agree those with the best hearts would feel the strongest repulsion for having anything to do with ads.<p>As to minds, he may be exaggerating, but not as much as you think. Try a less literal read:<p>For example, Google makes all its revenue from ads. It invests in Android as a way to maintain the reach of its ads in the face of mass migration from desktops to mobile devices. So by that measure, it&#x27;s not just Google&#x27;s adtech engineers (which I&#x27;d bet is what some if not most of their smartest mathematicians work on. I know, as regrettably I was once in the business), but also Google&#x27;s Android engineer that are &quot;thinking about how to make people click ads.&quot; Just today: <i>Google Targets Intent With Email, YouTube And Search Matching And Universal App Campaigns</i>.[1]<p>For another example read Dalton Caldwell&#x27;s story about working for SourceForge, and how it compares to GitHub[2]:<p><i>> The problem was, SourceForge was an ad-ridden, user-hostile piece of crap. Getting anything done required several extraneous pageviews & clicks. The site was designed to squeeze every last advertising penny out of you. I can’t blame management for trying to generate more revenue…. two months into my job there, 25% of the company was laid off.</i><p><i>> There was much public hand-wringing over the crappiness of the SourceForge user experience. There were two camps in these debates: those that wanted to build an open source, decentralized version of SourceForge (which someone did), and those that pointed out it was a free service, and how dare anyone complain about the user & developer-hostile aspects of the experience. Tolerating the bad behavior of SourceForge “is a necessary evil”, the apologists would say, “otherwise the service we all depend on might go away.” Does any of this sound familiar?</i><p>Compared to GitHub:<p><i>> Github has become a much-loved brand and service, and many would agree that it is a key piece of infrastructure in the technical renaissance we are currently experiencing. Github is apparently profitable, and it sounds like the people that work there spend their time trying to make the best service possible, as opposed to spending their time trying to extract additional pennies out of their users.</i><p>Full circle: Caldwell plugs the same Jeffrey Hammerbacher quote as jordigh.

To take an example from the article: interviewers are to ask candidates about some time that they used data to make a decision.  What if a candidate responds with a story in which they realized the data were pointing the way to a local optimum that the candidate cleverly avoided?  To you, smart HN reader, you are perhaps impressed, and tempted to slap the candidate on the back and rejoice in your shared membership in the club of those who&#x27;ve discovered ambiguity (&quot;Complexity, such a bitch, right?&quot;); but if the interviewer but dimly remembers calculus but is proud of themselves for using a sentence with the word &quot;data&quot; in it, then the candidate&#x27;s response will come off not as an indication of the ability to &quot;ask the right questions,&quot; but a sign of non-cooperativeness, &quot;irrational refusal to let decisions be driven by the data,&quot; and perhaps intellectual arrogance.<p>For interviewers, I have no idea what to tell them.  For candidates, I can only say: Lie, and then follow through.  If they are looking for &quot;grit&quot; but you had a privileged upbringing, make something up and commit to yourself to be grit-ful[0], rather than saying what&#x27;s in your head, which is &quot;I haven&#x27;t had much hardship but I get the importance of resilience.&quot;  If they ask for your greatest weakness[1], say <i>anything but your greatest weakness</i>; instead talk about the difficulty of coping with <i>other</i> peoples&#x27; weaknesses (&quot;I don&#x27;t deal with my father&#x27;s alcoholism as well as I ought,&quot; or &quot;I get impatient with lazy people.&quot;).<p>[0]This is basically what the sales people in your org do, which is why you get those requests.<p>[1] This is a dishonest question, because there are wrong answers.

Water ionizes really conveniently so you can make it an acid OR a base (which is sorta unusual and it can talk to acidic or basic things), and is polar (its got a + and a - electrical side, more or less, so it can talk to + or - things), and has hydrogen bonds (so you get liquid lifestyle at gas temps)<p>For one why, look up amphoteric and zwitterion.  Water has a super convenient pH range where about a ten millionth of pure water self ionizes aka ten to neg seventh or pH of 7, and all kinds of super convenient reactions occur above and below that pH and its really easy to manipulate ionization rates around that level without using too much.  You don&#x27;t need just a liquid but one where you can really screw around with something like amino acids by easily and cheaply changing the ionization rate of the liquid.  So there are super convenient chemical reactions that depend on the ionization level of the liquid and its really easy to manipulate water.  Conveniently water &quot;just works&quot; without having to add tons of other stuff to it.<p>Liquid methane isn&#x27;t polar enough to really be useful when messing with ionic substances (table salt, etc).  Whatever you use for a liquid, it needs to be polar so ionic stuff like salts can dissolve.  It turns out that interesting chemistry doesn&#x27;t happen with non-polar substances at normal temps; thats why when you bury stuff for a couple million years the only thing left behind undecayed (more or less) is non-polar hydrocarbons (crude oil).  Ammonia is polar but has other issues.<p>The hydrogen bonds are important.  Water should be a gas at room temp.  Really, it should, looking at bonds and molecular weight and stuff.  Yet the hydrogen bonds that form keep it liquid at room temp.  So you get &quot;gas speed&quot; chemical reactions at &quot;high&quot; room temperature, yet its liquid to a ridiculously high temp.<p>Maybe some custom liquid silicone with some bolted on weirdness could make a useful artificial blood plasma or &quot;stuff&quot; for life to live in.

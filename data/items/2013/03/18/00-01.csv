And then when someone violates the law, you kill them. You wouldn't have to do this too many times before the problem magically disappeared.<p>All that would do is wind up killing a bunch of 3rd party candidates and anti-establishment types. You can't simply place a law and then expect it to be 100% accurate let alone the people determining guilt be 100% ethical.

The answer is simple. Let me use an example from Joel Spolsky.<p>(From <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html</a>)<p><pre><code>    The dominant spreadsheet, with 100% market share, is Lotus 123. You're the\n    product manager for Microsoft Excel. Ask yourself: what are the barriers to\n    switching? What keeps users from becoming Excel customers tomorrow?\n\n    ... <snip: barriers to entry> ...\n\n    That's the barrier to entry. Not how hard it is to switch in: it's how hard it\n    might be to switch out.\n\n    And this reminded me of Excel's tipping point, which happened around the time of\n    Excel 4.0. And the biggest reason was that Excel 4.0 was the first version of\n    Excel that could write Lotus spreadsheets transparently.\n\n    Yep, you heard me. Write. Not read. It turns out that what was stopping people\n    from switching to Excel was that everybody else they worked with was still using\n    Lotus 123. They didn't want a product that would create spreadsheets that nobody\n    else could read: a classic Chicken and Egg problem. When you're the lone Excel\n    fan in a company where everyone else is using 123, even if you love Excel, you\n    can't switch until you can participate in the 123 ecology.\n</code></pre>\nIf you know that in the absolute worst case that you can still use the product even if it's shut down, then by golly, you have even less of a reason to not switch to it.",1363567735

I've been in architecture, research and pentesting across a lot of shops but I've always felt like minimum viable exploitation was all most places were after.<p>Fast forward years and you end up in something you don't feel like you've transitioned into something deeper. Sure, you can go there on your own but it has limited viability unless you're path forward is Pwn2Own or bounties in general.<p>I'd love to work for the Matasanos of the world but feel like I may be locked out based on the initial hurdle of being more proficient in code as a first class skill vs having a more honed skilkset in finding flaws on the systems as a whole. Also tracking the relevant things within the security landscape is a skill in and of itself and since most orgs don't understand how to find and cultivate that talent it open the doors foe the Risk.IO of the world.<p>Sure, I've done some reverse engineering, lots of (easy) pentesting and am proficient in Python. I've designed many F100 systems as it pertains to the security construct, yet I can't see a path forward to digging in deeper with those like Matasano. So @tptacek, any advice?

I think that's overt enough and more than mere inconvenience.<p>Also not sure how you discount being exposed to dangerous radiation as not ""overtly invasive"". I certainly don't see that as a different question.<p>But, I actually wasn't focused on airport security as much as the spirit of your response. This idea that we have to meet everything the bad guys do with ""more security"", which does equal less freedom, rights, and privacy. The PATRIOT Act, of course comes to mind.<p>Though, it certainly applies to the airport scenario too. Bad guys put a bomb in a shoe? We all take off our shoes now. Bomb in the underwear? We move to backscatter machines that image what's underneath. Where does it stop? It's crazy, and it's a product of the same general reactionary thinking that brought us the ""plenty of real problems"" you referenced.",1363564898

(I never planned on making money from it.) I've learned a lot since I started, and I hope others can benefit from its release--and perhaps teach me a thing or two as well :)",1363564871

Your historical examples make sense and I can think of many more. However when it comes to government sponsored research I need a little more convincing. Certainly there are good anecdotes and at $3B a year DARPA way be great relative value compared to DOE or NIH.<p>Thanks for pointing me to Tim Wu - very interesting analysis.",1363564846

Undoubtedly a great businessman (PayPal, etc.), but I think this was totally uncalled for, especially in public context. What really irks me is that he keeps it going and defends it.<p>I've never been a huge fan of Foursquare, but as a founder, I know my limits in criticizing others' ventures and ideas. My company is my baby. Publicly humiliating someone's hard work is something I think most founders would definitely take personally, so I can relate to Dennis' reaction. This definitely got way more publicity than was necessary, but I think it brings up an interesting reference point in providing feedback and criticism on ideas/businesses.",1363564834

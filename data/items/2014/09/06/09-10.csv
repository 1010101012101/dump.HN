I thought you were being sarcastic when you said that that art can be converted to a number.<p>I think it&#x27;s possible (or very likely) that no such metric exists, and that if it did, it would be of little value. For instance, do you rank art based on aesthetic value, or the visceral effect it has had on viewers (mean or max?), or societal impact? Perhaps all the factors, but how do you weight them? Is there an objective measure of aesthetic value?  It&#x27;s more likely that different individuals/groups/cultures have different aesthetic tastes that vary over time, so perhaps you average over these variables? By averaging over these variables, will the &quot;best art&quot; be the perfectly pleasant art you might find hanging in a hotel lobby? Or will it be bolder art that a subset of people will revile? Who gets to decide?<p>There&#x27;s always a chance that art can be converted into a meaningful and objective number. But if this metric does not exist, then by your logic, &quot;art and literature criticism would be nonsense.&quot;<p>In my personal opinion, art is by its nature subjective. Aesthetic value is rather arbitrary. Art criticism is probably <i>mostly</i> a sham. But without them, how would rich people know which paintings to buy?

I am American, and know just a bit of German (but am learning).<p>I have experience with every aspect of creating an application, from mockups and UX design, to graphic design, to the full-stack implementation, to deployment. I&#x27;ve successfully built and sold a past start-up of mine, and have a great deal of insight with product development. Because of this, I&#x27;m probably of most value the earlier a project is in its life cycle.<p>Backend stack: Ruby on Rails, with DBs/data stores such as MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, and Redis. I&#x27;ve also worked a bunch with Elastic Search. I can also use Node.js or PHP for the right project, but lately I&#x27;ve been doubling down on being a backend mono-glot.<p>Frontend stack: my preference is React.js, though I&#x27;ve done a ton of work with Angular.js and Meteor (and some Backbone). I am well-versed in current best practices, can build responsive mobile-friendly websites, and code pixel perfect CSS and HTML5. I have a great deal of graphic design experience and can help there as well.<p>Portfolio: <a href=""http://eatingthe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eatingthe.com</a><p>Github: <a href=""https://github.com/superplussed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superplussed</a><p>Email: jeremy@superplussed.com",1409994398

I meant shoveling all the BTC around while knowing he didn&#x27;t have even a figleaf of deniability (eg blaming an internal miscommunication with someone else who was in charge of compliance). He had to know it was enormously risky.",1409994332

Law enforcement is tasked with the EXACT SAME LAWS AS EVERYONE ELSE.<p>Apparently you like to confuse law and justice with &quot;who&#x27;s got which legislatures on their payroll and can put people down for accessing their stuff without permission&quot;",1409994320

In order to achieve a collision the attacker needs to control the contents of <i>both</i> certificates, which means they have to do all the computation and then somehow get a CA to issue a certificate with the exact contents they need. (This shouldn&#x27;t be possible - after the MD5 attack a few years ago, CAs are expected to to take countermeasures to ensure an attacker doesn&#x27;t have this level of control.)",1409994185

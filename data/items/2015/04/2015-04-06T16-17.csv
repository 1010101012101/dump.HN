And there&#x27;s room for a level of abstraction above webgl but below three.js.<p>Everyone uses three.js, but if you want to write shaders (a big part of the point of webgl IMO), three.js can be difficult to work with.  It has a fairly involved system for building its shaders from a big library of shader snippets.  Last I looked, it seemed pretty complicated to hook your own shaders into that system.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to write shaders, three.js is great, but if you do, it may be more than you want.<p>There&#x27;s another library I&#x27;ve used, also a low-level webgl wrapper, called GLOW:

JS is probably easier to grok in some circumstances, ie. you don&#x27;t have to send new devs to a blog post to explain the CSS on your project.<p>2) Cost/benefit analysis of dev time, ie. you could do X (where X is some minor display that 1% of your users see) in pure CSS in 12 hours, or do the same in 30 min of JS.<p>3) Cost/benefit analysis of page size, ie. you can do in 4 lines of JS what would take 400 lines of CSS. Sometimes a few lines of jQuery obviates several hundred lines of CSS (between the media queries, browser-specific overrides, and so forth).<p>The interesting question the article should address was why the CSS solution was a better choice than the JS solution. I have a gut feeling the answer is way better than &quot;we just wanted CSS only for purity&#x27;s sake&quot;, and personally I&#x27;m interested in knowing what that answer is!",1428339273

We are set to begin fundraising a Seed round in two weeks. Will this affect our ability to raise Seed money? Should we keep him on until we close and then dismiss him?<p>My company is 10 months old with three co-founders.  After a long discussion, my other co-founder and I decided that the third co-founder, &quot;Adam,&quot; is not doing enough work to justify his level of equity. We do not want his mediocre performance and commitment to be something that new hires think is acceptable. The other co-founder and I have a controlling stake and have full ability to dismiss Adam. His 1 year vesting cliff ends on June 1, 2015 where he is set to receive 5% of the company. We don&#x27;t think we can close a round quickly enough such that the deal closes before Adam vests his shares. However, we have already hired another person that can do Adam&#x27;s job who will join us on June 8. We are capable of brining the new hire up to speed on Adam&#x27;s work if Adam is dismissed before the new hire joins.<p>What does HN think we should do? If we dismiss Adam before we raise, will this be a big red flag to investors causing them not invest? What is the right thing to do here?  Should we dismiss Adam only after we have raised?<p>Background:
For some additional background on Adam, he is by no means a rockstar programmer. When he started, he was working at least 60 hours, but that has declined to 30-40. He consistently misses deadlines, takes days off, and the team is lagging because we are waiting for him to finish his parts of projects. What we have done in 10 months could have been done in 6 months with a more committed co-founder. We have given him many warnings but nothing has changed. We have concluded that forcing him to renegotiate his contract for a lower level of equity isn’t a viable option because it would only make him bitter and poison the culture.",1428338755

    mind-blowing valuation levels the company has achieved — $40 billion at
    last count — is this:
    
    &quot;Investors are valuing Uber as if it&#x27;s bigger than the whole taxi market!&quot;
    
    The implication?
    
    Investors are nuts.
    
    Well, investors are indeed valuing Uber as if it&#x27;s bigger than the whole
    taxi market.
    
    But it turns out that that&#x27;s not nuts.
    
    In its most mature market, San Francisco, the four-year old Uber is already
    bigger than the local taxi market. Much bigger, in fact.
    
    According to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who spoke at the DLD Conference in
    Munich on Sunday, the taxi market in San Francisco is about $140 million
    per year.
    
    Uber&#x27;s revenues in San Francisco, meanwhile, are running at $500 million
    per year.
    
    That&#x27;s more than three times the size of the taxi market.
    
    And Uber&#x27;s revenues in San Francisco are still growing at about 200% per year.

If you have a case, there are a number of routes that take a &quot;contingency based&quot; payment structure. If you have no case, the lawyer won&#x27;t take you.<p>Now with that said, some non-official legal opinion. So you had a company previous to this incident which had IP and employees? And a co-founder left, built the same exact company, with the same exact IP, and same exact employees? And then that co-founder got into techstars? And then that co-founder secured several million dollars in funding for said new company? And now you would like to sue this co-founder?<p>Maybe you see where I am going here. This is not exactly an open and shut case. Usually if a co-founder (or anyone else from within an organization for that matter) suddenly leaves with a substantial amount of IP and employees this raises the legal red flag right away. Yet you have come AFTER the company moved forward, received seed funding, received a series A round, and is now running at least presumably more successfully than it was before. That is not a good legal position to be in for you.<p>Second, although I have no idea what techstars seed round due diligence looks like, I am absolutely sure that the Series A round had a rather large legal due diligence process which included checking on the IP and making sure it was more or less clean. The start up world may be the wild west of funding but investors don&#x27;t just handle over millions of dollars and hope for the best. This is not to say that a company can&#x27;t lie, they can, some might, and often they do get caught during due diligence.<p>Sorry, the whole story sounds a bit fishy. If you are in fact in a small group of people who were &quot;left behind&quot; this could be entirely legal and even a viable business strategy. I have seen companies where a reverse merger acquisition has been made to move profitable employees and IP while leaving behind substantial debt and less profitable employees. I wouldn&#x27;t call it ethical, but it is viable and certainly legal in some cases. Every situation is different though. Consult an attorney (or 3, because legal opinions are just that, opinion, until a ruling or a settlement is made), see what your options are, and move on.",1428338685

Frankly, if the goal is shared network accessible performance, nothing you can build with PC&#x27;s and SSDs will come close. The on the wire latency and bandwidth that even a single 2U (60TB) unit provides is fairly shocking. And that performance doesn&#x27;t degrade over time, even under extreme load. The official performance numbers on the IBM site are actually conservative, which is unusual itself. The units are all custom (in a way that is a negative, cause they aren&#x27;t cheap) and built like tanks. Although from an end user perspective they are very simplistic. AKA they provide a RAIDed volume(s) on the SAN and nothing else. Your on your own for replication and the like, although I think they have a canned solution for that now.<p>Bottom line, they cost a mint, and are built like old school over engineered IBM hardware. But you won&#x27;t be kicking yourself a few months down the line as you baby your custom storage solution. Normally i&#x27;m the guy building stuff like this, but sometimes I would rather just sleep at night than get called because the garbage collector kicked in on a SSD and it dropped out of the RAID in the middle of a big load.

Added to this, is the idea of anticipating and smoothing any regulatory humps by gaining consensus before launch, allowing growth to be faster when it actually does launch.<p>These are both smooth moves if that&#x27;s the intent, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sufficient if the tech is really so indefensible.<p>I think another important consideration is long-term branding. Because the tech is not defensible, there&#x27;s going to be a whole bunch of competitors, so how can we differentiate ourselves? &quot;We&#x27;re the ones who did this safest, and we&#x27;ve been about safety from day one.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s going to be a pretty compelling narrative for human gene therapy suppliers.<p>It&#x27;s encouraging to see strategic smarts in science at an early stage in a bio venture that could end up having a very large impact on medicine. So that&#x27;s really cool, my hat&#x27;s off to them for these plays. I think the new biotech therapies will need huge monopolies with the resources and motivation to push with the highest standards. After all, for developing biotech, do you really want to be buying your medical future, from a garage startup? Or from a massive name?<p>So I think it&#x27;s smart they&#x27;re clothing themselves in the apparel of major names from day one: caution and safety.

These are acceptable in the world of objective-c, because they are used with parameters, but they are not really suitable in this way in C#.   So we map the API names to forms that are idiomatically correct in C#.<p>In the above case, we would like map those to a single &quot;DrawString&quot; method name with three different overloads.    But this depends on the case.   In general, we follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for our naming conventions.<p>As for forms, you are correct, we built it for a class of users that had different requirements than those that are building consumer applications.<p>Now, while I am the first one to tell developers to use our native APIs to create great consumer experiences, just last week I ran into a gorgeous looking app and only later I discovered that the gorgeous UI was actually built entirely with Forms, even the animations.<p>More importantly, the app was built on record time by a single developer.   I could not believe it (need to ask the customer for permission to disclose that their product is built with our product).<p>So I walked away with a new insight: that good UIs require good taste and someone passionate enough to make the UIs happen and that even something that we intended for mostly business scenarios can create great UI experiences.",1428336478

For example, if a project wanted to move from GPLv2 to GPLv3, IIRC, you can&#x27;t do that without the permission of all contributors unless they have signed over their rights. And as @trestletech has pointed out not all contributors are created equal[1].<p>One the one hand, you have people making significant contributions (and you don&#x27;t want to just stomp all over them), on the other hand you could have people making tiny contributions, yet are holding up everyone else.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver/commit/6f3c6b2f4543487a8a4c2ff04d88a500c4772298"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver/commit/6f3c6b2f454...</a>",1428336000

The coupon sale price for frozen Dominicks (Safeway) chicken breasts in Chicago is $4/lb. A fresh pack of chicken breast --- again, the grocery store crap --- will easily set you back $7 (which is approximately what Empire runs /lb at Trader Joe's as well).<p>I don't have a strong opinion about whether junk food is ""truly"" cheaper than ""healthy"" food (I cook every night and think it's generally a good idea for every family to get into that habit). I think it's a kind of a moot point, because what many poor families really lack is a history of having time in their schedules to cook. Cooking is a skill built through repetition and serving home cooked meals is a habit that is hard to establish.<p>What does bug me though is that every time this topic comes up, some nerd hits Google and finds either (a) some ludicrously unrepresentative price sample (""you pay $6/lb for chicken? i can get new york strip for $5.50!"") or (b) some combination of beans and millet that will feed them just fine for a month on $3.<p>It is not enough, to win this argument, for the math to come out slightly in favor of home cooking. Home cooking needs to win on all three axes:<p>(i) price: home cooking has to be invariably comparable in price to McDonalds to win,<p>(ii) convenience: it's got to be straightforward to cook <i>and to serve</i>, bearing in mind that one of the hallmarks of low-income working families is shift work, <i>and</i><p>(iii) palatability: this doesn't mean ""it has to taste as good as junk food"" (although realistically that is a factor); it means that you have to find <i>one dish</i> that you can serve <i>four people</i> and have them all come away satisfied.<p>None of those are easy to accomplish.

3041336,comment,3040937,3040937,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I find this ASTRONOMICALLY interesting! I wonder what will happen to us...<p>In the past, JOBS were a way to redistribute money and keep the money cycle flowing. The rich who owned companies are rich because the average consumer pays for their products and services. The rich then hire workers and pass money down to them, as well as spend money on other products made by other workers. But as unemployment reaches 20% then 30% then 40% over the next 50-100 years. We'll have to readjust the way we redistribute money in order to keep the money cycle going. Otherwise the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer, to a point, then the whole system will collapse because who will have the money to buy your products. If the middle and lower class don't have any money to spend on the products that the company using robots makes... Product creators will effective kill off their own wealth machine.<p>Decades ago 80%+ of everything we bought was made in our own country, now that number has dwindled down to, 20% was it? It was some terrible small number. Outsourcing to China was good in the short term (cheaper more affordable products) and terribly destructive in the long term (disrupting the money cycle and destroying jobs). Now everyone in the US is pissed off about unemployment, we're passing all sorts of job bills and stimuliouses, while we're all ignoring the giant elephant in the room. We pissed our jobs away in the name of cheaper products (consumers are just as guilty as shareholders).<p>Look at what outsourcing to China has done. Rich get richer, poor got poorer, then the economy tanked because consumers don't have money to spend on the products the rich make. Now imagine what automation is going to do... Driverless buses and subways (already in testing / already in use) that don't go on strike, robots that fix robots (almost there) and never ask for a raise. Robot pharmacists that don't make mistakes (already in testing). Robotic construction workers that don't join unions. The people who own these businesses that employ robots over humans will make tremendous profits and save lives and do a better, faster job too. But they will HAVE to redistribute their money using a new method. Socialism? Who knows.<p>I'm not afraid of this future where robots take over. In fact I'm looking forward to it. I'm just afraid of our refusal to adjust to it.",1317084101
3041335,comment,3038264,3038264,3,0,5hoom,,,"Meh.<p>I'm working on a video game at the moment, and have read lots of advice like this. My old game engine experiments all used 'Entities' to describe objects in the game world, and these 'Entities' were created, deleted and invoked by an 'EntityManager' (kind of half factory & half controller). Every game tick, the EntityManager calls a 'tick' method on all the current game entities and facilitates communication between them. For the most part, all entities are created/destroyed at the same time (game-level loading/unloading).<p>Trying to avoid architecture mistakes, I've come up with all sorts of tortured designs to do away with the concept of any kind of 'manager'. It is probably my inexperience with various design patterns, but all these alternatives were overly complicated and difficult to use. I would end up with a mess of objects & functors all needing pointers to each other & stepping on each others toes.<p>It then occurred to me that my 'manager' was in fact mapped to the real-world concept of 'a manager', being someone/something that is given orders from upper-management (game-level data, user-input, etc.) 'hires' & then assigns tasks to 'workers', hands the results to upper management, then 'fires' the workers when they are not needed ;). The metaphor works.<p>So I'm back to the 'manager' pattern and things are moving ahead quite nicely, even if some OO purists might frown. Should I call my 'EntityManager' 'EntityBoss'? Gets rid of the 'er' at least...",1317084016

Where before the Internet a lot of people wasted most of their day watching TV (soap operas), they now used the Internet. Collecting all of these hours 'saved' from millions of people contributed to great projects such as Wikipedia.

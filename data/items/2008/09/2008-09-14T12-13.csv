The upvote button is there, the title is there - most people are going to be making the vote at that stage, not after.",1221397129

All strengths no weaknesses?<p>You reject Craigslist for being not technical enough, yet the most detail you give is ""I have an idea""? Are you looking to compute spaceshuttle flightpaths using CUDA, make ""a web daytybasey"" or write a portaloo rental scheduler for SAP?<p>Someone who shares the same values? What values? Running a company then leaving it? Posting a vague post and when criticized and asked for more details, telling people to stop whining, then making insinuating comments about them? Complaining about being given a hard time when faced with a dozen paragraphs of text on the internet?<p>This is the internet, you talk people listen. Spend time and effort listening. Hundreds or thousands of people, minutes each. Person hours wasted. Consider the ice pre-broken.<p>It might be a bit late now, but giving lots more details is about the only way you could salvage this thread, IMO.",1221396676

303721,comment,303642,303684,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"A guy was brought in to consult on a startup I've been contracting for. I googled him: He had done something fairly impressive and pioneering in the early days of the web, and he currently held a writing/editorial position at a fairly prestigious web publication besides whatever company he was with. He was supposed to be polyglot, writing in PHP, .Net, and Ruby. I was kinda impressed--I mean, I don't have a wikipedia page.<p>So he helped us get off the ground with some new-to-us tech we were using, but it turned out that his Ruby code pretty much sucked. So maybe Ruby's not really his thing. He was supposed to be writing about PHP at that publication, so I looked up his articles. Not a single one with even a line of code. Just unfulfilled future plans and occasional business/culture musings. And really the problems with the Ruby code weren't just syntax or library unfamiliarity--there were smells there that should have been bothersome in any language.<p>So I start filing bugs against his code, and it turns out he's not interested in fixing them. In fact, if the startup has any more ""architectural"" consulting they want him to do, he'd be happy to weigh in, but he doesn't really like to code much anymore.<p>Yeah--my respect for him as a developer went way, way down. (I'm not comfortable saying respect generally here.)",1221396150

303717,comment,303592,303711,0,0,13ren,,,"I saw your reply just after posting mine (though you posted ahead of me). Very similar.<p>One factor that is counter to your point 1: it could be that in our evolutionary past, there was greater variation in physical appearance than today that did affect competence, such as disease, malnutrition and accident, and so judgments based on appearance had greater predictive power then than they do today - but we still retain it as a basis of judgment.<p>A scary thought is that judgments of ""competence"" might really be judgments of ""power"" - i.e. it's judging whether you'd better go along with them; not their competence. In fairy tales, the princes and princesses are good looking, because they are well-nourished, looked after and trained - which is because they are supported by a power structure (the king/queen). Regardless of their ""competence"", you'd better defer to them. Keen awareness of the local power structure is strong in gregarious animals like us.<p>I'm suggesting that health and confidence are indicators of power to our evolutionarily-trained instincts.",1221395688

303714,comment,303592,303683,0,0,13ren,,,"""Looks are just noise"" is the conventional wisdom. I'd be surprised if there was no correlation at all, between ""looking competent"" and ""actual competence"".<p>Isn't beauty (for want of a better word) associated with symmetry? And isn't that associated with healthy development of body and mind? And isn't that a positive factor for competence? I think people react against ""looking good"" because we have a tendency to over-value it; but dismissing it entirely (as an indicator) is simply the opposite error.<p>On the other hand, being naturally gifted (and relying on it), instead of working hard, can undermine one's success: <a href=""http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-sm...</a><p>In Harding's case (thanks for link; I'm not from the US), much judgment seems to dwell on his oratorical skill, not on his ""actual competence"" as a statesman. If voters liked his speeches, and that was their purpose, then his oration showed competence with respect to its goal. <i>Disclaimer</i>: I really know nothing about him.<p>I guess a simple solution to my original question is to select a field where competence <i>can</i> be measured objectively (not politics!), where the actual correlation between ""looking competent"" and ""actual competence"" can be ascertained empirically. I'm sure this has been done already...",1221394653

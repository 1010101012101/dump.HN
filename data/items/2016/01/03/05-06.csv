10829701,comment,10826838,10829082,0,0,questerzen,,,"PG does appear to want to do a better job than the rest of his industry and he should be applauded for that.<p>But there is very little evidence that PE or VC funding adds much value to a company through advice or services: the poor performance of post-boom PE funds and their companies, for example, suggests that such claims are vastly exaggerated. I recently had a conversation with the head of a very successful fund who, reflecting on the aftermath of the financial crisis, openly expressed his doubt that his fund had really helped the companies they bought stakes in. He, of course, became exceedingly rich and the steady stream of inflated IPOs produced healthy returns for the funds investors (at least until they didn&#x27;t.) A large part of the problem is that the compensation model (the traditional &quot;2 and 20&quot;) is geared towards the capital providers not the entrepreneurs or indeed to social benefits. Funds are incentivised to raise huge sums of capital from sources who offer nothing but cash and a healthy appetite for risk and over-capitalise the companies they fund (the fund earns 2% on invested external capital regardless of how it performs). To compensate the investors, the funds rely almost exclusively on extracting a very large profit from the few &quot;unicorns&quot; that succeed outrageously (of which the fund gets to keep 20%, or sometimes more). Taking $100 million from a single company is hard to justify, however greatly you value the advice and support you got. And the many worthy productivity-enhancing near-successes are left to flounder. PG may like to focus on the positive impact he is having helping founders succeed, but the reality of his business model is strongly skewed to financial rent extraction.",1451800553

10829697,comment,10828450,10828450,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"The central claim of the post seems summarized by this quote:<p>> For example, when using a non-numpy API or functions that don&#x27;t use Numpy that return regular arrays, you either have to use the normal Python functions (slow), or use np.asarray which copies the data into a new variable (also slow).<p>but I disagree strongly with this.<p>First of all, if there is a common use case for some set of operations that need to be performed on very large data (the type of data you&#x27;d look to NumPy to handle), then generally there is already a subpackage within numpy/scipy/scikits/pandas/etc that already deals with that use case and natively handles it with NumPy arrays, with no switching cost to convert back forth between lists or tuples or whatever.<p>And, of course, when a list/tuple-heavy API is only meant to deal with small data, it&#x27;s not a problem to use NumPy&#x27;s facilities for converting between ndarray and the builtin array types. In cases where you&#x27;re dealing with a huge breadth of small data, then that casts doubt on whether you should be using NumPy; it wouldn&#x27;t be casting doubt on whatever the other list/tuple-heavy API is. And probably parallelization (or even the buffer stuff I mention below) is a fine solution in that case.<p>Second, in a lot of cases you can make use of the Python Buffer Protocol to share the underlying data of a NumPy array without copying it. This won&#x27;t help if some other API expects Python lists or tuples, but the great thing about dynamic typing in Python is that all that really matters is that whatever underlying buffer type you need implements whatever methods that other API expects to call.<p>You can always write your own extension type that adheres to the Buffer Protocol and also provides whatever API is needed to conform to some other library, so the power to create these double-sided adapters (one side sharing data with NumPy, the other side appearing like a drop-in acceptable data structure for the other library API) is very powerful and generic. It might take some getting used to the first few times you do this, but if you use tools like Cython to help, it&#x27;s really quite easy to do, easy to maintain, and solves a surprisingly wide range of NumPy integration problems. In fact, these things generally already exist for most problems you will run into and ultimately they often boil down to simple Cython-based wrappers around C bindings to the other Python API you&#x27;re working with.<p>I would argue that the existence of this Buffer Protocol adapter strategy alone is enough to say that the switching cost to D is virtually never worth it, and still pretty speculative even if you&#x27;re starting a brand new numerical computing project.<p>Finally, most Python libraries that heavily rely on the list or tuple APIs are not meant for large data (those APIs mostly already just use NumPy, as I mentioned, or else they use generators and let the end user decide which array type will eventually be instantiated as the results are consumed). It&#x27;s not common, by intentional design, for list/tuple-heavy APIs to need to cope with large data, so when someone says something off the cuff like &quot;What do you do when some library API needs lists and you&#x27;ve got NumPy arrays?&quot; it <i>sounds</i> like a worrisome case, but in practice it&#x27;s really, really uncommon that such a situation arises and no one else ran into it before you and no one has created a NumPy-compliant solution already. It&#x27;s not impossible, of course. Just unlikely, and probably not important enough to use as a basis for language choice, unless you&#x27;re facing a really special sort of API problem.<p>Edit: None of this should read at all as a criticism of the D language or this particular implementation of ndarray data structures. All that stuff is great and anyone wishing to use D absolutely should.<p>I&#x27;m <i>only</i> arguing against the post&#x27;s central thesis insofar as it is used to justify considering D as an alternative to scientific Python. The problem that the post points out already has solutions solely in the Python ecosystem, many projects have handled that problem before, and the problem is pretty rare and esoteric anyway, so it&#x27;s probably not a good thing to use as the basis of an important choice like which language to use, or whether to switch languages.<p>There could be many reasons to prefer D over scientific Python depending on a given use case, and there could be certain situations where switching from Python to D is a good idea. Whatever those cases may be, the central issue of this post, performance degradation caused by NumPy-to-other-API compatibility, is <i>not</i> one of them.",1451800414

10829686,comment,10829422,10829422,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Interesting exploration and impressive persistence.  This approach definitely provides more detailed information about how the process worked.  This seems like the only approach that would have worked back in 1982.<p>Reading the description of the archive.org project at <a href=""https://archive.org/details/apple_ii_library_4am&tab=about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/apple_ii_library_4am&tab=about</a> makes it clear that this effort intentionally deconstructs and documents the original copy protection.<p>Other than as an exploration of copy protection, though, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the simplest approach to preserve and run the same software today would involve an appropriate emulator, more accurate floppy drive emulation, and the unmodified original disk image.  The crazy amount of self-decryption and obfuscated code wouldn&#x27;t matter as long as it found what it expected on the disk; the modifications just let it run on real hardware using a copied disk.<p>Apart from allowing the use of the original unmodified disk, emulation would also avoid the possibility of missing more subtle copy protection schemes.  This particular disk made things easier by just stopping the game at the start.  Some of the worse copy protection mechanisms developed later would detect a copied game, leave it somewhat playable, but make it either exceptionally difficult or intentionally broken near the end.  Sometimes they would include a more obvious copy protection scheme to defeat that prevented playing the game at all, so that a prospective cracker would think themselves successful once the game starts.

My point was that Sanders definition (esp as paraphrased by you) is silly to the point of being meaningless, since it consisted of &quot;X isn&#x27;t paying enough for Y to get off welfare, thus X is receiving welfare&quot;. This applies to my example writ small. Your painter example isn&#x27;t much difficult from the Craigslist example: the person spends his time doing multiple things that add up to less than enough salary to live off of. That doesn&#x27;t make any of the purchaser&#x27;s of his services responsible for the shortfall. To the extent that anyone else is responsible, it&#x27;s all of society.<p>> Why can&#x27;t those that need their house painted pay what it actually costs to get the job done? Because if the full time painter needs welfare, they&#x27;re in reality paying him too little.<p>You&#x27;re defining &quot;what it costs to get the job done&quot; very bizarrely here. If the painter takes odd jobs but his wife is employed too such that the two of them are somewhat comfortable (at least above the poverty/welfare line), by your definition it would suddenly &quot;cost less to get the job done&quot; (since the shortfall to a reasonable income has now diminished/disappeared)?  This is of course an absurdity.<p>The problem again is that you&#x27;re picking a way to place responsibility for subsidies that makes no sense from either an efficiency or an ethical standpoint. Assuming a need to take care of the poor, we all share that responsibility. The only reason we&#x27;ve &quot;decided&quot; that the burden should fall on arbitrary industries and their employees/customers/owners[1] is because that way we can pretend that we don&#x27;t believe in taking care of the poor and the robust welfare system that it would entail.  All we&#x27;re doing is creating a shitty, roundabout version of welfare.<p>Note that I have a tendency to consider complete systems when it comes to policy. In the current political climate, it&#x27;s no doubt more feasible to implementing higher minimum wages than, say, a basic income. So despite thinking that minimum wages are a terrible idea in a well-functioning system, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily vote against them in our less-than-optimal system.

The tracker ends up as a mediator that obscures or limits communication about the real issues, and without a change, that can be disastrous in a troubled organization.<p>So... the point of the graph is more of a quick way to confirm that triage/prioritization is being done wrong, so that you can make a decision on how to fix that.<p>And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll cover in the followup essay. :-)",1451798121

I know all about them since wholesale flowers are sold this way (hence the dutch connection) and my brother in law&#x27;s family is in flowers.  It&#x27;s a very fast form of auction since a single bid wins each lot.  Rather than the price being driven up in fits and starts it drops at a steady and fixed rate.<p>Similar to the article&#x27;s authors dutch actions improve the average at the expense of the extremes (in this case towards sellers).  Dutch actions don&#x27;t often have the sky high prices some traditional actions can drive rare items to but they tend to sustain high average prices because you must bid without reference to the value someone else may place on the item.  A traditional auction you may sneak away with an item for less than you expected if no one bids against you.  In a dutch action you will likely pay closer to the maximum price you were willing to spend since the longer the wait the greater the risk someone snaps it up without any recourse.<p>I hadn&#x27;t ever thought about a dutch action for highly coveted copies of the same item though.  It&#x27;s very interesting idea that would likely kill much of the launch day line up (especially if preorders were accepted online).  If the 100 the store has to sell are the only ones that would ever be the prices would be driven into the stratosphere but if you know you can wait a week or 2 for your preorder to be filled and pay the actual &quot;retail&quot; price that&#x27;s a strong incentive to stay home and buy it online rather than waiting in line for hours.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction</a>",1451797860

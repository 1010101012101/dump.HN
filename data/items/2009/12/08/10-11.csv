We will use lots of images. As you can see from Tutorial final image preview, we will create door to Wonderland, where Alice invites you. Also we will create popular Cheshire cat and add some fairytale elements, like fairy. In this tutorial we mostly will use images adjustments tools, transform tool. Also we will use some brushes.

983393,comment,982803,982803,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's interesting and very promising. But what I miss in most discussions of relational vs NoSQL is some kind of separation of data model related, performance related and scalability related arguments. These are three rather different issues.<p>There is no way to have a benchmark alone show me what it means to denormalize my data model. Denormalization can help scalability and sometimes performance, but it has huge implications for maintainability, data quality, code complexity and even organisational matters.<p>I do understand the advantages of being able to run any algorithm on data and not be limited by SQL. But abolishing normalized data models altogether and replacing them with application code and custom data structures everywhere makes me very skeptical as someone who had to deal with data quality issues for many years.<p>So that's why I'm glad to see some performance issues of RDBMS improved by new storage architectures and also the innovation going on in terms of recursive queries to deal with hierarchical and graph data structures.",1260267462

This explains the cost. And as I said, the console is indeed expensive if you want it permanently, but is free for 2 hours and we seldomly  needed it more.<p>Now if you are set with the computing power provided by a 20$ VPS that's another thing, I'm just saying, if you need more you should consider a dedicated server or maybe collocation.",1260267445

Men with average to below-average intelligence think that they are quite clever. And very smart women think their intelligence is low.</i><p>That's clearly a misleading statement which has nothing to do with genders. The thing is, as far as I understand, is that the smarter people are the better they are at assessing  themselves, and the more they tend to be careful about their estimations. Dumb people, on the other hand, usually think they are smart, because they have very little data and knowledge to prove themselves the opposite, and every little step they make and piece of knowledge they learn seems a big deal to them.",1260267384

Even as a fan of Maemo there is no doubt in my mind that there will always be more Android phones on the market than Maemo phones.  Also if you're intention is to sell apps and make money you're best bet of the two is Android.<p>If writing phone apps was my day job I'd easily choose Android over maemo any day of the week.  As a geek programming simply for my own enjoyment the Maemo platform is far more enticing, if for no other reason than the fact that I get to use tools like Qt4, C, python, and all the libraries available for Linux. The idea of having basically a slightly stripped down Debian on my phone is just really cool.  Plus the new Maemo 5 seems to finally be a truly usable environment running on some nice hardware.",1260267154

It's a highly technical form of training akin to doing scales all day long on a musical instrument.  I'm sure there's a folder in some archive in Aix full of extremely boring and careful studies he did at the time.

The overall user experience is way more important than anything else, even backwards compatibility, i.e. compare Windows Mobile with iPhone.<p>The competitor who will really square it off with the iPhone in the future will have to be really good at the integrated user experience IMHO.<p>I talked to some Maemo marketing guys at FOSS.in in Bangalore the other day and their key message was that ""You can run multiple applications at the same time. You don't have to shut down one application to be able to run another, like on an iPhone.""<p>But the handset they were showing (they called it a handheld computer, not a smartphone) was clumsy and unattractive. They were not even showing them turned on, so I couldn't really judge the user experience, but if you don't want to show it I don't believe it is a strong selling point.<p>The Android team seems to concentrate more on the user experience, something which I haven't seen the Nokia teams really do yet, so I think Android is better placed, for now.",1260266402

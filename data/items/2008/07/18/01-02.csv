The rationale is that most of your cash is protected (short of a government default) albeit making modest returns.

It didn't seem like many facebook apps on their own made that much sense, especially for VCs.  I mean, they basically allow you to spread your ads across a small portion of facebook's site.  As a business model for a couple dudes, fine, but as a model to throw millions of bucks on, not so sure there.  Unless VCs were hoping facebook would acquire them, which it doesn't need to to benefit from them, so why would it?",1216342920

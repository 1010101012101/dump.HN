675422,comment,673955,674641,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Yes, I thought of that as I wrote my comment.  However, I see it as a somewhat separate problem.  The pension funds were, essentially, raided.  If that were prevented (that dreaded word, regulation), we might still be in a situation where pensions provide a very stable retirement income.  Further, preventing such behavior would force the pension providers to own up to and correct their problems sooner, instead of milking retirement earnings as a short term compensation for those problems.  Those that couldn't correct their problems would fail.  But the pensions would remain intact.<p>I think what is currently happening with many pensions in the U.S. -- e.g. underfunding followed by default of one manner or another that transfers the pension obligations to the increasingly underfunded Federal government insurance/guarantor program that pays a small portion of their original value -- is criminal, ethically where not (explicitly enough, apparently) legally.  But it does not of itself discredit the concept of pensions.<p>At the same time, I'm no expert in this.  I'm open to considering opposing arguments.  Let me put part of my point another way:  Expecting every future retiree to become an investment expert is inefficient.  All that time and effort duplicated across so many people, to manage in each individual case relatively small amounts (excluding that small percentage of the very wealthy).<p>But maybe it's like democracy; all that work by individuals is necessary to keep the system honest.  And when the work isn't done, the system degrades.  Perhaps the best we can do is to all hire investment advisors (whom we choose) and to treat no investment, no benefit as ""guaranteed"".<p>But, with regard to the topic of risk, this is a lot of individual risk.",1246024799

Adding data elements has been nothing more complex than adding it to the class. Queries that filter on elements in a single class are trivially easy - but I think there are types of applications that need nothing more. Querying across classes would require more work than the relational equivalent of querying across multiple tables.<p>HOWEVER, my sense is that bringing a relational mindset to object databases is not going to realize the full potential of them; you have to think about storing the data elements differently.<p>Object databases seem great for OLTP apps. In particular, ones that require working with individual accounts/patient charts/etc, i.e. query a person's account, modify a data element, and save it back to the db.

The amount of innovative stuff that reaches the mainstream is very very low. You could say that it is, by definition, but i would argue, and that's very subjective, that even some of the hits of the 80s wouldn't have been released by todays Record Companies standards , wich has never been so conservative.<p>Especially in artistic matters, quality can't only be gauged by the amount of stuff you're gonna sell, and even if it's a criteria, it shouldn't be the only one IMO. The generalization of music sharing on computers allows the growth of a much more liberal ecosystem here, and i think it's really for the better !<p>The question of wether people should be 'allowed' to think about music as a free thing, (in short , morally abbrogate copyright) isn't clear to me. Intellectual Property is one of the biggest foundation of today's economy. Questionning it is scary. I don't know if it should disappear in artistic matters, but i surely think it's a question we have to debate today.<p>We have a very important position in this, as the Open Source  'movement' is maybe the precursor of such conceptual trends. I think we owe to ourselves and to our peers, as hackers, to ask ourselves, and to question the facts deeply about these matters.",1246021492

If you believe this is what your are meant to do then quitting will be a regret you'll never get over. And bankruptcy is bad but it is short lived (relatively).<p>2. If you are in the business because you saw an opportunity and are taking advantage of it... If you saw this as an opportunity, but don't love it for what it is, then get out before it causes too much debt, but not a minute earlier. In the meantime try like hell to get it to work but there will be other businesses to build.",1246021327

Why not at least include a URL, or description of your product to help us gague whether it's got legs?  It feels like you're still keeping your product in the stealth mode, but at the same time complaining that it's not getting any traction.  It's not clear to me how you expect something to take off if the company's only employee refuses to also serve as your PR person.",1246021325

Not as good as a REPL, but way better than what you normally have to deal with in C++ and gdb.<p>Check out the sample code in the source distribution. The 'let' type hack the author uses makes this some of the most readable C++ I've seen. The same thing with templates would've been either a forest of angle brackets or required a boatload of typedefs which the reader would have had to constantly refer back to.",1217181535
258306,comment,257958,257958,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I think that you might really struggle trying to pick up Django without really understanding programming or Python.  That doesn't mean that you shouldn't try, I'm just suggesting that you might struggle.  A lot of people approach web frameworks from scratch and think that they can learn it in a couple of weeks and be proficient at them.  It takes a lot of time.  I'm thinking a good 6 months before becoming proficient.<p>Sure you can cut and paste the code from the tutorials and have a simple blog application and running in a week, but you won't really have a clue as to what's going on inside the framework.<p>There are a lot of parts of Python that Django uses that can be a little overwhelming to a noob programmer.  For instance, URL's are crafted by using Regular expressions.  Regexes might take you a couple of weeks to get your head around if you've never used them before. Django also tends to pass dictionaries around as arguments, which can be confusing and overwhelming if you've never seen them before.  Same thing with it's use of list comprehensions under the hood.  The use of <i>args, </i>kwargs or variable length arguments can be a bit confusing as well.<p>So, be patient with yourself.  Django is certainly a great framework and well worth the time investment to learn.  Python is also a great language, but again, these things take time to learn well.",1217181473

Additionally, the prediction quality is lessened when people are not very discriminating in who they link up with, or all edges on the graph have the same weight or can not be tagged with useful, meaningful metadata.

It might be possible to code them for free, but hosting on an ongoing basis, not so much. There are plenty of businesses where ad revenue just won't cut it.<p>""For instance, that’s why content-based businesses (say newspapers) are doomed because there’s always people like Mark, me or even the average guy willing to spend one hour in their day writing articles and take pictures of what’s up.""<p>It's sad that newspapers let it get to this. It used to be that their journalism was a cut above. They spent the (relatively) big bucks on the good reporters, gave them the leeway to chase stories, many of which never amounted to anything, in order to provide hard hitting analysis. Now they just farm it out to AP or Reuters, until some clown bloggers think their hour a day is a solid substitute.<p>Newspapers that actually do quality reporting (NYT, WSJ) are struggling with the new economy but will come out ahead in the end.",1217180104

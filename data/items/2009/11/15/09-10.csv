They all give great feedback and I prefer them for typing larger amounts of text. Of course they are absurdly lound, and I'm happy that my coworkers don't complain (too much).<p>On the other hand, I detest keyboards that only use a soft rubbery membrane that feels like I'd dip my fingertips into honey (which is basically every keyboard that nowadays is shipped with cheap systems). While it may sound illogical, using those for anything larger than a simple blog-post and my hands begin to hurt. Maybe because the lack of feedback makes me assume a unhealthy hand-posture?",1258275633

There are many more major security issues that don&#x27;t get branded and hyped up, they just get solved.<p>Would you have all major vulns receive the same level of PR? If so, there would be a C-SPAN style, 24 hour channel constantly discussing the latest issues. This channel would <i>not be commercially viable as the majority of people would ignore it</i>. No amount of PR for individual issues will increase the public&#x27;s awareness of the real problems. The media coverage of Heartbleed was particularly useless, as it <i>didn&#x27;t tell anyone what they should, or could do</i>. The sysadmins updated their systems, the developers patched their libraries, the general populace just worried non-specifically about something they couldn&#x27;t do much about.<p>I would also like to point out that the human race survived without PR for thousands of years.

The &#x27;Naming&#x27; section of your link references the osd.<p>Calling it just one or the other is enough though. Being &quot;under a Free Software license&quot; by definition means &quot;the code is open (i.e. you can study it), so no need to say &quot;<i>and</i> Open Source&quot;.<p>I do however prefer calling it free software over open source as I find the free software definition simpler and than the osd. And also because the term open source seems to place importance on the code being &#x27;open&#x27; instead of &#x27;libre&#x27;, which you&#x27;ll here rms talking about everytime someone says open source.<p>&quot;Free software&quot; has issues as well as a term, since free can obviously mean two things, gratis or libre. However, once the reader/listener has understood the difference between free of charge software and software that preserves your freedom to study, modify and redistribute it, I think open source is the more problematic term as it can more easily cause confusion as demonstrated by your comment (where you think open source means that the code just has to be &#x27;open&#x27;).",1423199835

Steelmaking is like most manufacturing process, cost decreases with scale. Usually the specialised grades simply aren&#x27;t in high enough demand to recoup the costs involved in producing them.<p>For some grades the techniques to produce them are suitably differnt from standard grades that lines needs to be diverted and retooled to handle them, which impacts on yield and causes losses due to downtime etc. Not to mention many of the specialised alloying elements like Niobium etc. are also stupidly expensive. Buying these in small quanities is probably not ideal and I&#x27;d imagine its probably risky to buy in bulk because orders may not be filled quickly and business doesn&#x27;t tend to like having capital tied up in raw material stockpiles.<p>Competition is also very fierce, for a while there has been an excess of steel capacity largely driven by rapid expansion of China&#x27;s steelmaking capacity. So there is a lot of pressure on keeping operating costs per tonne low all of this kind of leads companies towards where the biggest returns are, which is producing the high volume steels at lowest cost. Thus most of research effort gets directed here as well. Thats not to say R&D isn&#x27;t happening into specialised grades, its just not where the big payoffs are currently.",1423198853

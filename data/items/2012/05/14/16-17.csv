It is not trying to replace JS just sit alongside it as an application language. It lets developers target CPU architectures instead of Operating Systems which makes a lot of sense to me.<p>Even if it's not trying to replace JS, if it works well enough, a lot of sites will use it to replace JS, whether because they want to add functionality that's not as easy to implement in JS, because they don't want to expose their source, or just because their programmers don't know/like JS. We have already been through this with ActiveX, which was a similar idea, but poorly executed.<p>> Also it's C/C++, any popular app would be easily ported to mobile devices.<p>Only if the developers care. There's a chicken-and-egg problem here. If your mobile platform can't interact properly with a large proportion of the web, no one is going to buy it, and so no one will bother to port their site to it.<p>> ""Compile to javascript"" is an awful concept, ""compile to IR"" is better for a number of reasons that I won't go into right now.<p>Possibly. If you absolutely have to run C/C++ app on the client side, I agree that something like PNaCl (but actually architecture-independent) is a better solution than something like emscripten.

It isn't as much of a slam dunk as you think it may be, and the gulf in opinion is broad and branches out into many tributaries.<p>Materialism is the belief that everything in the world, including mind, was material, but that has progressed into physicalism since late nineteenth century physics showed that not every force is made up of matter.<p>I used to be very interested in this topic and leaned towards the idealist argument of mind being made up of more than material, but I lost interest as the debate on both sides tends to spiral and involve religion and spirituality. But I still tend to believe that if we completely cloned a brain materially, we would still not have a mind, that it would be missing something.<p>My own conclusion is that we simply do not know, and that to me is more interesting than knowing as the pursuit is more rewarding than the end goal.

A good ORM is fantastic for speeding up <i>development</i>.

But using SQLAlchemy, we develop far, far, faster than if we were using SQL directly. And it's flexible enough to allow me to drop into the SQLAlchemy Query language when I need to hand tune a query, or to SQL itself if I really need to get close to the metal.<p>Will there be downsides one day?

A very illuminating explanation is <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms</a> and related posts.<p>I'll try a personal approach: imagine a country with no computers, no photocopiers, no presses, and a very strict law that forbids making copies of books which is indoctrinated from birth. There is only one copy of each literary creation, guarded in the National Library.<p>We can imagine that the people of that country have a very hard time to distinguish between ""The Lord of the Rings"" in an abstract sense and material object #1434 stored in the second floor, section Fantasy. For them LOTR is just <i>that</i> set of paper and ink. Even if someone secretly made a copy, letter by letter, it will be ""just a copy"", not the ""true"" LOTR. That's quite obvious to them.<p>And in a sense that's a bit our current situation with people (not exactly, because books are static and people aren't). We can't scan people-as-information out of people-as-protein-body and store them as people-as-silicon-body, so we mix the concepts. But it's just confusion due to technological limitations.<p>So in a sense we DO have souls, but it's a mathematical or information-theoretical soul, not a metaphysical one. It's always <i>bound</i> to a material instantation, but that concrete physical manifestation is not the same as the dynamic, interactive information process a person is.<p>So if technology advances enough we'll be able to copy a person, and it'll make no sense to ask which of them is really ""you"". Both are.",1337013103

I'm American but lived in Italy for several years in the late 90s, and ""Why is our economy so inefficient?"" was a common topic of discussion at the time.  Almost no one thought it was because of long meetings or too many managers; there seemed to be a consensus among the people I spoke with that the number one problem was the type of regulation mentioned above (e.g. not being able to sell books after 18h in a <i>bookstore</i>).<p>It's important to realize that lots of those regulations <i>do</i> actually have a purpose, which is to keep certain sectors of the economy dominated by small sole proprietorships instead of by big corporations.  Again with the bookstore example, a Borders or Barnes and Noble or any other big box store chain would just give up on such a market.  On the other hand, an owner/operator of a small bookstore would either find loopholes (like this owner's swap with the cafe owner across the street) or else they just grease the right palms and work around the rules.  In either case, success depends on the kind of social capital big corporations will never have.<p>TL;DR  The purpose of these ""senseless"" regulations is to keep shops in Europe small and charming.

The difference is subtle, however it leads to important differences. For instance the preferred way of doing package management is to use RubyGems and Bundler, instead of Maven and its repositories or something based on it (compared to SBT or Gradle or leiningen). And devs when working with JRuby are using the same libraries as they use with Ruby MRI, because many libraries provide a JRuby-optimized backend. For example devs working with JRuby would rather use Nokogiri, which is used for searching XML/HTML docs with XPath/CSS3 selectors, instead of something Java-specific.<p>So JRuby's ecosystem is more closely tied to Ruby MRI, rather than to that of the JVM, which is why I think this article is not really accurate and JRuby shouldn't really be on that fourth place.<p>And out of these alternative languages, I love JRuby more because this is a language with multiple mature implementations, which isn't something many languages can brag about, and I don't have to be tied to the JVM and its ecosystem.",1337012069

I haven't run into this problem in practice; usually what I need is the last auto-incremented key value of a newly-inserted row.<p>If you are getting the date/time value outside of the database -- from a web application, for example -- and using that to insert into the database you will run into inconsistencies eventually because clocks on different will not be synchronized or will be set to different timezones. In my experience it's more important that all date/time values in a database come from a single source (the database server itself) rather than which column type you use. It's easier to control the clock and timezone in one place than require all database clients to be set to UTC and have their clocks synchronized.<p>Setting all clocks to UTC is not enough to get around daylight savings time issues, either. You actually have to know the timezone to do accurate date arithmetic. You can find lots of articles about this -- it's a pretty well worked-through topic. Think for a minute why every operating system and RDBMs and programming language date/time library aren't just using integers and assuming UTC.<p>Date/time types are native types in all serious relational database engines, so there's no conversion going on that you need to worry about. All RDBMSs have mature date/time manipulation operators and functions. If you use large integers you are going to be doing more conversions, especially once you have to deal with timezones.

Often the shipper wants the place that's closest to them who is cheapest.<p>Its not dissimilar to the airline system. Everyone ranks things that they want better of on flights (service, seats, legroom, meals, nice planes, etc) but (nearly) everyone searches by first price and then by rough schedule, often rewarding the cheapest.

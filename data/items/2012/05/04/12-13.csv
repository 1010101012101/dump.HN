Even Chinese characters might be invented like this 2000+ years ago, the shape of them haved changed for several times. The meaning of most characters cannot be judged by its share.<p>Reading posts on Chinese forums( ruby-china.org , zhihu.com , douban.com , weibo.com ) I think would be benefit, the phrases and sentences used frequently in daily life are always better for people who are still learning, comparing to novels or something like that which contains many language skills.  \nAncient Chinese is not a good choice, it's a bit hard for a big part of us to read, Though many articles in acient Chinese was teached in school, it is rarely used during conversations. (Like Haskell, it's great but not widely used.)  \nAnd I speaks Chinese well, I'm worrying about how to learn English well.",1336136378

3928145,comment,3927858,3927858,6,0,jonheller,,,"I kind of agree. I've attended two conferences for the past few years: Pubcon and An Event Apart.<p>Pubcon was priced at $699, and included three full days of sessions, with 5 different tracks. I learned a lot there, and felt it justified the price.<p>An Event Apart was $899 the first year I registered, I believe, and this year is $1045. I work for a small company that pays these expenses, but I couldn't even justify asking for that this year.<p>I know that I am paying to see some of the ""biggest names"" in the industry. Several of these people are excellent and entertaining, and I don't doubt their knowledge in the field -- Dan Cederholm and Jared Spool specifically.<p>But do I really need to pay over $1000 to hear from the ""biggest names""? I'm not sure if it's worth it. Yes, Eric Meyer is a genius at CSS, but how do I somehow explain the ROI of using slightly more optimized CSS? Or one year AEA had a speaker who spent almos the whole hour somehow relating fashion magazines to web development. Ugh.<p>I guess what irks me is feeling like I'm paying extra for the celebrity status of some of these speakers, when in reality, I'd most likely learn just as much _useful_ knowledge at a Wordcamp or one of the multitude of sub $200 conferences.",1336136186

Very few jobs will openly reject you for not having a degree, but if you have a degree from a good school people recommend you more, and tend to assume you're smarter. They're more likely to value your opinion, more likely to brag about having you on their team. A lot of companies, even on the West Coast, will automatically grant you an interview for having a degree from a good school, or automatically deny you an interview for not having a degree. You gain access to a massive network-eg, if you contact someone from your same school, odds are high that they will take time out to talk to you.

3928122,comment,3926938,3926938,1,0,nissimk,,,"I can't tell you whether staying in school right now is a good idea for you or not, but maybe my story will give you an interesting case study.  I went to Columbia straight out of high school in 1994.  My birthday is in October so when i started i was 17. In my first year i had to take a lot of required courses that i wasn't that interested in and my grades were not very good.  My dad liked to complain to me about the cost of my school and although he never bothered me about my low scores, i felt pretty bad about it.  Meanwhile, i met this guy while i was in high school and his father was ceo of an old software company in new York so he got me a job there for the summer, and i continued working part time while in university as well.  I was testing a windows app that was written by a team of 10 developers.  My performance at work was much better than at school, so I found it more rewarding.  As it turns out, the automated testing software we were using was a hot technology and someone told me i could get a consulting gig at ge capital if i dropped out.  So i made the decision to do that after completing only 3 semesters.  My mother was pretty upset , but my father didn't really mind too much.  Unfortunately, that consulting gig was canceled pretty soon after i started but i had made some contacts and i got a real programming job at a different ge company.  This was 1995 and i was 19.  I continued contract software development at a bunch of big and small companies for the next few years with few issues about having dropped out.  In 2000 i left a secure contract at Goldman Sachs to try a startup on my own.  When that didn't work out, it was the depth of the NYC job market downturn in 2001 and it took me 4 or 5 months to find a job.  Having been a contractor and business owner i was not eligible for unemployment.  I don't know if having a degree during that time would have helped me get a job faster, but i did hear about it from recruiters and think about it a lot during that time.  My next job turned out to be with good people so i switched to full time and they paid for me to go back to school at night and i got a degree from the CUNY ba program in 2005.  I haven't been out of work since then but mostly that's because i lucked out being at a mortgage company that failed right at the begining of the crisis in 07 and my next shop has been very successful in weathering the downturn.<p>I see a lot of comments here about how if you know what you're doing and you're a good software engineer then you will always have an easy time finding work.  This is just not true.  When supply of software engineers outstrips demand in the market where you are looking for work it becomes difficult to get a job.  It is during these times that you may have trouble since you don't have a degree.  Also, if you get to a point where you want to advance beyond software development into a business side or management role, you may have trouble based on your lack of credentials.<p>The other point to understand that is directly related to your question is that as you get older you demand a higher salary.  This makes it harder to get work.  There are fewer jobs for people at the higher salary levels so again, your credentials may come into play more when you're 10 - 15 years in, seeking new work and asking to be paid significantly more than someone with 5 years experience.",1336135653

3928119,comment,3927858,3928002,3,0,k33l0r,,,"I complete agree. We're a small Ruby consultancy and we run a relatively small Ruby/Ruby on Rails conference in Helsinki[1] and before we organised it for the first time we basically had no idea how much everything would cost.<p>Expect to be overcharged for everything ranging from coffee, to having power outlets available, to having tables for registration. You can expect a cup of coffee at your venue (any venue) to cost the same or more than it would in a good coffee shop (but it won't be anywhere as near as good). Lunch will probably cost two times more than it would in a decent restaurant nearby (but good luck finding a restaurant that can cater to 200-300 people at once).<p>Oh, and most venues have terms which prohibit you from using an outside caterer and thus you're stuck with the venue's own catering, no matter what it costs.<p>In terms of compensation for speakers, we do our best to help them out, but the economics of running a small conference means that we can't afford to pay everyone's travel expenses (never mind paying them a non-insulting speaker's fee). I wrote a blog post partially related to this about a year ago: <a href=""http://blog.kiskolabs.com/post/5661615036/controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kiskolabs.com/post/5661615036/controversy</a><p>In terms of making money, we'd be much better off just concentrating on our core business, but then it's likely that Finland wouldn't have any Ruby conference at all. We'd love to be able to drop our prices to the sub 100 level, but frankly that's not possible, not even with the great sponsors that we've been lucky to have in the past years.<p>To help with the ""high"" ticket prices, we offer discounts to full time students and discounts at a few levels to people who have contributed to Ruby on Rails. In fact, if you have enough contributions to Rails, we'll give you a free ticket.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://frozenrails.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://frozenrails.eu</a>",1336135604

3928117,comment,3927858,3927858,8,0,jperras,,,"As a frequent conference attendee and speaker, a lot of the points that this post enumerates resonate with me. Our profession seems to have a love affair with conferences, and it's been getting worse year after year.<p>I believe a large part of the problem is that many conferences are priced with the idea that the fee will be covered by corporations that pay for their employees to attend, as opposed to being covered by an individual. Businesses have an easier time justifying a $1000 conference ticket (especially if they're able to recruit or scout out new potential hires at said conference) than an independent consultant.<p>But, conferences don't <i>need</i> to be quite so expensive. Conference organizers just need to reorganize their priorities. The best conferences I've ever attended (and paid for out of my own pocket) had less than two hundred attendees, were <i>not</i> held in a hotel, and had an incredible focus on the local community.<p>The best example of this: <a href=""http://brooklynbeta.org/2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brooklynbeta.org/2011</a>. Total cost for the conference was $100, and an additional $100 for the (optional) special event held the day before the conference, both of which included food, coffee, sponsored after-parties, more beer than we could finish, and the list of attendees and speakers was the best that I had ever seen.<p>People need to start voting with their wallets a bit more. Stop going to conferences that suck.<p>[Disclaimer: I now work for the organization that runs Brooklyn Beta, but did not work for them when I attended the conference in 2010 and 2011]",1336135590

3928114,comment,3927670,3928013,6,0,klodolph,,,"Extending this farther, I'd say everything you read or listen to in a foreign language should be in some kind of context, the richer the better.  Reading characters outside of their context in words is pretty useless, but reading words outside of sentences isn't that much better, and sentences can be pretty awful by themselves.<p>For example, in English: ""Do you have any paper towels?""  What does the sentence mean?<p>Context #1: At a supermarket, talking to a clerk.  The sentence means, ""Please direct me to the cleaning supplies.""<p>Context #2: At a friend's house, after I spill soda on the floor.  The sentence means, ""Please give me some cleaning supplies.""<p>Context #3: A friend asked me to help pack for a camping trip, and we're going over the list of what's packed.  The sentence means, ""I suggest packing cleaning supplies.""<p>Context #4: A friend spilled spilled soda on someone else's rug, but is unconcerned.  The sentence means, ""You should clean that up.""<p>Exercise: Come up with a context where the sentence has its literal meaning, ""do you have any paper towels?""<p>Pragmatics (as above) are a pretty extreme example, but even fairly plain descriptive sentences can be indecipherable without context.  E.g., in Japanese  you know that somebody lent someone else a book and that the speaker somehow benefited from this action, or perhaps feels grateful.  It probably very clear in context, but you have to practice reading it with the context.<p>And this is why flash cards suck (not that they're useless...)",1336135521

By paying this rate, they're trying to ensure professional speakers of presumably high quality.  They contrast this with other options:<p>""Should all conferences be a single day long and only feature unpaid and inexperienced speakers? Should they all take place in second tier cities in low cost venues and force attendees to bring a packed lunch? Or should they be scrapped altogether, in favour of paid for content on a tutorial site...""<p>There's definitely room for middle ground in there.  Personally, ""second tier"" cities are probably better choices for many people, due to lower costs, but why mention ""packed lunch""?  You can certainly have great food provided in 'second tier' cities, and at a lower cost to boot compared to 'first tier' cities.<p>Paying $2k for each speaker is certainly a nice gesture to the speakers, but they're setting up some extreme options here (basically spending $5k+ per speaker, vs nothing).  Best value for all parties will probably be in between those extremes in most cases.",1336135363
3928105,comment,3927670,3927986,12,0,ekidd,,,"Well, it's a 3-minute introduction, and it's specifically focused on character mnemonics. Of course it leaves stuff out.<p>But my real complaint here is the notion of a ""royal road"", an ideal path that works best for most students. This goes against 50 years of experience at the US Foreign Service Institute. Let me quote them:<p><i>Lesson 3. There is no one right way to teach (or learn) languages, nor is there a single right syllabus. Students at FSI and in other government language training programs have learned and still do learn languages successfully from syllabi based on audio-lingual practice of grammatical patterns, linguistic functions, social situations, task-based learning, community language learning, the silent way, and combinations of these and other approaches.</i><p>Let me back this up with some personal experiences. I currently speak French at a level between CEFRL B1 and B2. In other words, I can carry on a social conversation or follow a science documentary on TV, but I can't watch movies or function as an educated adult.<p>And I didn't even look at French grammar book until recently. Instead, (1) I overlearned hours of French audio and text with help from English translations, and (2) I spoke with native French speakers. I learned a huge fraction of French grammar from context and occasionally reading a footnote in <i>Assimil New French with Ease</i>.<p>So when I first read a grammar book that claimed, ""French tends to avoid the passive voice,"" I thought, ""Well, yeah, because I can always use an impersonal subject with 'on', or a reflexive thingy like 'il se dit'. After all, it's nicer that way.""<p>So if I were going to learn Chinese, I'd begin by working very hard on tones and pronunciation. But after that, I would try to pick up the basic grammar from context. If Chinese strongly favors stative verbs to copulas, I want to figure that out by reading Chinese, not by reading grammar books.<p>This isn't to say that the ""Beginning Chinese Reader"" isn't excellent. I'm sure it works wonderfully for a great many people. But there's a half-dozen good ways to learn any language, and Memrise or LingQ or full-time conversational immersion might work better for somebody else.",1336135347

And you have it wrong if you think that tech conference attendance fees are paid for by the individual programmers/devs who attend.

With the slow job market, not only are many 20-somethings hanging out in graduate school but many (if not most) immigrants enter the market with offshore B.S. and U.S. Master degrees.

CUSEC, which is a tremendously valuable conference for attendees, did give me a USB stick in the form of a lego block, I will cherish that long after people have forgotten USB technology.<p>Anyhow, I'm not arguing with travel and accomodation, but as a Dad it can be lonely leaving my family even if it's a real pleasure to meet people at a conference.

The problem is networked digital devices make large scale (unauthorized) copying and distribution cheap, trivial, and unavoidable. Selling popular (and expensive to make) media content without DRM and legal (and enforceable ) anti-pirating laws is simply not viable IMO.<p>At least I've never heard a scheme floated that seemed remotely plausible as in industry business structure to do this. I'm music producer and in arguments where I've explained how expensive it is to produce music and how hard it is to recoup an investment, when people have understood my argument, they've thrown up their hands, saying if the music industry is that bad why would anyone even do it? \nAnd I think it points to a general devaluing of creative work afoot in the culture. That might not seem like a big deal to some, I think a lot of really don't care about what kinds of media get made or how: it's just hard tu take the same peoples cries of injustice on the part of the MPAA as a serious threat to human progress because they can't watch what they want, whenever they want, for a super low price (or free).\nIt might be that some awesome new business model exists to support an industry that creates digital IP products that doesn't rely on artificial scarcity and IP but I haven't heard any proposed",1336133277

I also think the methods are sound (ie. mixing the word in, substitution, the way the actual tool tests you).<p><pedantry>\nIt does feel very limited. I think you'd outgrow this in a couple of weeks TBH.<p>For example, this article gives  as one of the first characters, and says it means ""child"". It does, but it also doesn't. On its own it is purely conceptual, and only has meaning combined with other characters. If you said ""my  is 4"" then that makes no sense. It can mean bullet (), atom (), son (), or a generic ""thing"" measure word (eg. , conman).<p>An early learner doesn't need to know the word for 'bullet' or 'atom', but it's not good either to tell them that """" means child and then they think they can say ""child"" in Chinese. What's the parallel in English? It's like teaching you ""pre-"" and saying that means ""early"", and then you run around saying ""He arrived pre-"". Why not just teach the word for child () and then substitute that? Then you learn to recognise <i>meaningful words</i> and not <i>conceptual characters</i>, which is actually the key skill in reading Chinese.<p>You have to start somewhere, but I wish that more Chinese learning tools/books used modern learning methods like these, but with better linguistic accuracy. \n</pedantry>",1336133201

3928005,comment,3916826,3922694,1,0,anotherthrow,,,"> To say that they have a monopoly over their products is not a cogent statement as every manufacturer has such a 'monopoly'.<p>Well, I don't know what you mean by 'cogent', as that's generally taken to be a property of <i>arguments</i> and not <i>statements</i> (there may be loser notions, but as I say you'd need to spell out what one you intended). However, the statement that 'Apple have a monopoly over Apple products' is a <i>true</i> statement, which is all that matters to establish the semantic point. It might be trivial, but it's trivially <i>true</i>.<p>If I might try a helpful suggestion, it seems to me your confusion is arising because you're thinking something like 'if x is a market segment, then x isn't a market'.

I forced myself to learn in college for personal reasons.  Oftentimes, this was hard, really hard.<p>Having said all that, this page was quite a joy to read.  I know all those characters, and the page has one big flaw for learning these characters--the pronunciation.  Nevertheless, it was a fantastic way to express the meaning of these characters.<p>If anything, I'd say that it captures the essence of Chinese characters--building up new meaning blocks by compounding basic pictographs together.  This is the premise of the Chinese 'radical' system--radicals are the subcomponents of characters like the ""child"" and ""female"" characters that comprise ""good"".<p>Developer aside: the majority of written Chinese is comprised of about 1000 or so radicals.  This may seem like a lot, but having learned enough to recognize them has helped me even in development--I feel like I learn hotkeys, plugins and VIM commands a lot faster than my coworkers because I forced myself to learn how to memorize.",1336133033

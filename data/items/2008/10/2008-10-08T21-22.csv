327154,comment,326683,327063,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Git works on OS X and Windows, but it isn't quite as fast (many of its speed optimizations are coupled with aspects of the Linux filesystem), and its maintainers are placing low priority on portability. I never said it didn't work, just that it isn't especially important to them. That raises a lot of red flags for me.<p>I work on amd64/i386/sparc OpenBSD at home and Windows at work, and I think version control systems are one of the tools that should be <i>especially</i> platform-independent: How will you port your project to another platform if you can't even track patches for it there?<p>I'm not saying that it doesn't work, just noting that so you can make an informed decision based on your priorities. I hear a <i>lot</i> of buzz about Git, but hardly anybody mentions this, and changing VC systems with thousands of commits can be <i>extremely</i> painful.<p>Where Git is written in a mix of C and sh scripts* , Mercurial is written in Python (except for a few parts written in C for speed, such as its diff algorithm), and its design seems far less coupled with any particular platform (and much cleaner overall, IMHO). I spent an afternoon importing a very large project (40,000+ commits, 10+ branches) currently using perforce into monotone, git, and mercurial repositories, and compared them. (This was on Windows.) The git interface seemed in many ways too rough around the edges to me, and while it was very nearly as fast as mercurial (and a bit faster than mtn, even with cached inodes), the database also needed to be re-compacted. Mercurial was much, much more straightforward to use than either mtn or git.<p>* $ grep ""#!/bin/sh"" /usr/local/bin/git* | wc -l  ===>  23",1223502777

On that timescale, most of us had better change something soon.<p>I don't think talking about green communities ignores technological advance. Rather, what's changed is the angle of technological attack. Green communities are an interesting experiment. Most of us work on taking the technology used by most of the world, and gradually reducing its sustainability and environmental footprint.<p>By contrast, zero carbon communities start with net zero carbon output to the environment and hope that they can expand from there to be economical and capable of sufficient densities.",1223502341

327138,comment,326697,326697,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Excellent submission. It seems that the method they use for conducting discussions: asking a whole bunch of people in parallel for an essay, and then revealing them, allows to conversation to be a whole lot less contentious, and a much broader set of viewpoints and arguments to be heard (rather than the argument being dominated by fights over a few sticking points). I see that there are many other questions asked by Templeton.org as well. Thanks for pointing it out.<p>As for my opinion, I don't think the free market corrodes moral character, because it can spring back.

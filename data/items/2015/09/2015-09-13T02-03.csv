The town was founded in 1635, it was already 200 years old when Thoreau moved into a hut on his buddy Emerson&#x27;s land. The Boston and Maine rail line past Walden Pond was already running when Thoreau moved in, for goodness&#x27; sake.",1442113135

However the principle hardware designer was Tom Knight, David Moon wrote a lot of microcode (the Lisp Machine&#x27;s microcode did a <i>lot</i>, e.g. eval, GC, the bytecode interpreter), he and Dan Weinreb are the only authors listed on the cover of the 1981 4th edition of the manual, Weinreb wrote the first text editor for it, the per Wikipedia and my faint memory the 2nd EMACS implementation, and the first with a GUI and done in Lisp.

10210186,comment,10209752,10209997,0,0,bcaine,,,"If you design the system correctly, flickering should not be visible to the human eye. Obviously that depends on factors like clock rate of your transmission and your coding technique. As long as your signal is reasonably DC balanced and your modulation rate switches faster than the human eye can detect (say > 60Hz), you should be in the clear. The IEEE 802.15.7 working group [0] proposes clock rates of 200 kHz to 120 MHz, which all should be fine.<p>As for a separate IR emitter/photosensor, in theory it could increase range. Range ends up being decided by a bunch of tradeoffs and channel conditions that effect your Bit Error Rate (BER), which increases the further you move away from the source. The major factors that effect BER is the noise in the room (the ambient irradiance levels of other light sources), your transmission power, photodiode sensitivity to your wavelength, filtering quality, area of photodiode, and forward error correction quality. So moving to a wavelength with less noise certainly would help tremendously, assuming everything else is equal.<p>[0] <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6163585&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6163585"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=616358...</a>",1442112743

Dark markets, internet gambling and a handful of other novelty and niche communities can extract genuine utility from bitcoin, and that should continue into the foreseeable future, but the general population just has no use for it. None. Despite all the hand wringing about having to endure the treachery of big banks, pull style payments, and entering long credit card numbers, bitcoin is still harder to use, even harder to keep secure, and without any guarantees, assurances or consumer protections. Bitcoin is an interesting novelty at best, and everyone knows it, even many bitcoin enthusiasts.<p>Now, in recent months, we&#x27;re suddenly hit with a bevy of stories about big name financial brands and famous VCs pouring cash and research into the blockchain, and just like that, the goalposts have shifted. <i>This</i> is what we&#x27;ve all been waiting for; <i>this</i> is what will <i>really</i> bring bitcoin into the mainstream, there <i>has</i> to be something big here when you look at all the colossal mountains of cash that have been dumped into the bitcoinverse... yet somehow, we&#x27;re still at a loss as to exactly how the &quot;x but with blockchains&quot; formula is meant to revolutionize everything. If the 100 million dollar investment into 21inc&#x27;s vision of putting a bitcoin miner in every refrigerator is any indication of what we&#x27;re to expect from all this investor cash, I think we can safely assume that what we&#x27;re witnessing is simply the hyperbolic bitcoin hype machine functioning within normal parameters.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m probably just an idiot who doesn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; bitcoin, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to understand, since even after all these years I just can&#x27;t grasp the amazing potential of bitcoin.

This might be due to differences in &quot;character&quot;. I can&#x27;t reproduce the argument here, and I don&#x27;t have a link, so I&#x27;m being a bit vague but the point is, something in the Human mental make up caused us to form more successful communities than the Neanderthals.

It&#x27;s not an intrinsic property of the apple. It is entirely a result of the plans and hopes of those individuals who deals with the apple.<p>You can of course counter that all value is derived from the hunger of the apple eater, why else would the driver, merchant and producer bother?<p>And that&#x27;s where something like Bitcoin could enter the picture.

10210080,comment,10208861,10209785,0,0,rsy96,,,"> Well, I find whole thing rather controversial, so to say. Depends on what do one mean by &quot;collection&quot; and by &quot;point&quot;, eg. if we take point literally: (x, y) \in RxR, then we have to assume that &quot;collection&quot; is uncountable (which seems counterintuitive, esp. from the school student&#x27;s pov). OTOH, one could treat &quot;point&quot; as representation of that point, eg. pencil mark, so that point is no longer single element, but rather an uncountable subset containing the point of interest, along with its neighbourhood => our &quot;collection&quot; becomes countable, so we could think about it as bunch of indexed points (much more intuitive, isn&#x27;t it?), shifting our attention towards mapping&#x27;s representation from the mapping itself.<p>The whole paragraph does not make sense to me. For example, how is a collection uncountable somehow unintuitive? Why should a point not be a single element, but a subset or a pencil mark? Are you confusing the theoretical graph with the graph actually drawn (which has finite width)?",1442109624

I hear people complaining about the sizes of lossless music files, but not about 1080p video files. In fact, I have read comments from people complaining about only having 720p available from iTunes because of their 1080p televisions. However, these files are measured better in terms of gigabytes instead of megabytes. In other words, lossless music files shouldn't be problem, especially so with the cost of storage and bandwidth available. They are not that large when you compare them to even compressed video files (that are 720p or even 1080p).",1319810217

I think it would turn it into a chore. After all, geesh, the kid is only 11.

It has the potential to teach so many lessons. The coolest part is that it is all driven by motivation on her side -- she was the one asking for the machine, she is the one picking out the product, she is the one saving up for new machines, she is the one responsible for scouting out new locations and making the pitch to store owners, etc. If she pushes a lot, she could make some real cash.

I've answered a lot of questions on SO (although virtually none in the last year) and started doing so a few months after it launched. In that time I noticed two things:<p>1. The low-hanging fruit got answered (generally speaking most of the highest voted questions and answers are early); and, this is the important one<p>2. The volume of questions and answers was higher. One impact of this (IMHO) is that people see each question for a shorter period before it drops off the front page. It's that period on the front page where the bulk of votes come from (although there is a significant long tail, particularly on questions that surface on the front page of Google a lot).<p>HN is of course a news site so the ""low hanging fruit"" doesn't equally apply but there is some relationship. Each article is, to a varying degree, part of a larger debate whether it be about free software, user rights, the future of the computer/phone/tablet/whatever, etc.<p>In the early days of HN such debates probably had livelier discussion due to previously unsatisfied demand. Now though I think there is a lot of rehashing of the same point.

821595,comment,820810,821160,0,0,vidarh,,,"Staring someone down is seen as hostile, but giving eye contact has a profound effect on how people react to you.<p>For a long time I had problems giving eye contact, and many geeks I know are like that - we often look down or to the side. That makes us seem maladjusted, weak/insecure and/or submissive in many situations, and people change the way they react to you accordingly. It also makes people not particularly interested in walking up to you to start a conversation.<p>Looking people straight in the eyes, as long as you don't overdo it, makes you seem approachable, strong and self confident. Just that one change of looking people straight in the eyes more had a big impact for me on making me more social - I'm still bad at approaching people and start talking to them, but when you give eye contact the number of people who will start conversations with <i>you</i> can easily skyrocket.<p>What I mean is not staring at people incessantly, that's creepy, but keep eye contact until either they look away or 4-5 seconds or so. During conversations, keep steady eye contact maybe 70% of the time. And avoid ""jerking away"" - often when someone is insecure about maintaining eye contact you'll see them pull their eyes away quickly, often turning their entire head away, as if you caught them doing something they shouldn't. It doesn't give off a positive impression.<p>You'll see peoples demeanor change when you meet their eyes. During my commute most people walk around with vacant expressions on their faces. Get eye contact, and smile, and you see lots of people light up like christmas trees. The same happens when I talk to people - staff in shops in particular, who often seem downright robotic normally, tends to light up, and start holding proper conversations and telling me all kinds of things about their life after I started making a point of giving eye contact.<p>I'm in London which is unusually ""cold"" in this respect even for Europe, so you might not see the same effect, but try looking around you to see how few people give eye contact to shop staff; it'd drive me crazy to work in an environment like that.<p>Of course you <i>can</i> use it as a kind of dominance that freaks people out. If you're able to keep eye contact until the other person always breaks off, then you <i>will</i> see a lot of people adopt a more submissive attitude to you. Personally I'd rather they just see me as someone approachable and nice to be around.",1252935138

Cassandra doesn't necessarily solve this, however, unless you have enough failover that it is unthinkable that you could have cassandra lose data.  If you can rebuild the cache in cassandra you can rebuild it in the identical way using my scheme, but my scheme only requires N days of data to be run through.<p>Step 2 is fine, memcached allows setting of timeouts on keys.  If you always set a timeout of (dig_time + five_days) - now() you are set.  Be careful, times > 30 days imply a unix timestamp not a timeout.<p>Mysql kindof sucks.

It started with the usual fractal techniques for producing contours, but then it went on to use weighted random walks to produce roads and rivers, lakes, bridges, and cities.<p>I've tried recreating the algorithms from what little I remember of them, but they never produce anything that looks very good. Online I've found plenty of references to ways of generating the contours, but never realistic-looking roads, rails, and waterways...<p>Does anybody know an online reference to that sort of thing?<p>Thanks!",1252933345

Whilst water is cycled through their is a substantial lag involved meaning that water reserves can be damagingly depleted.<p>Throwing consumables away that are still directly usable is unnecessary waste - put the rest of the water on your pot plants or pour it in the kettle to use later.<p>One other thing, do you saran-wrap (aka cling-film) a glass of water sitting on the counter in the kitchen? Why then do that when it sits in the fridge? If you find you need a cover then use a reusable container with a cover.<p>Local caching of water still makes plenty of sense.",1252933248
821559,story,,,2,3,ssanders82,"Ask YC: Review my idea - Online book discussion",,"I'm reading Taleb's ""The Black Swan"" right now and, while it makes some amazing points, there are important sentences in the book that leapt out at me as being grossly oversimplified or non-rigorous (don't know if that's a word but it makes my point). I'd like to discuss/ask someone about them but nobody I know is reading the book currently.<p>Here's my idea, (which actually would NOT work for copyrighted works such as ""Swan"" but could be implemented as an addon to the Gutenberg project for public domain books) - create a discussion site in a 2 column layout, where the book text is on the left and user-added notes are on the right. Notes are editable by anyone, Wikipedia-style. I particularly think this would be useful for older works as by Shakespeare to decode some of the old terminology.<p>The notes would be the equivalent of author-added asterisks or footnotes, and could encompass explanatory text, interesting historical references, links to other sections of the book, or could link to a ""discussion"" thread for the book section.<p>In a physics textbook, alternate examples could be given. In a poem, hidden or dual meanings of a word could be explained. You get my drift.<p>I feel the Gutenberg project is filled with enough important works to stimulate interest in discussion, and this would perhaps make reading the classics a little easier. (Have you ever tried to read Ulysses?) I know there are dead-tree explanatory texts of each of these works but there's no chance for a dialogue - you can't ask the reviewer for clarification or raise points of your own.<p>Thoughts?",1252933244

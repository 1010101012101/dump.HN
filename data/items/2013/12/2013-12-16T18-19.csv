6916986,comment,6914805,6916450,16,0,Artistry121,,,"To your first paragraph your point only holds if there is absolutely no competition for workers (which may be the case).  And yes, it still is voluntary.  I once bought a phone off craigslist.  It was a decent phone, worth probably $50 but I got it for $35 because the seller needed cash right away.  Just because he was illiquid does not mean it was wrong of me to buy the phone from him. Or was that immoral of me and should I have been required to give him $50?<p>I agree moving is difficult - but so is creating efficiencies like Bezos has done.  If your social views include the view that life should be easy for everyone, no matter their contribution, then we have a fundamental difference in what is realistic.  If that is your view though maybe a better solution would be for those with money who share your view to support those without jobs or working with Amazon (or pay them to not work for Amazon).  It is very easy to ask Amazon to change their policies, but that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t your money.  (It&#x27;s also worth noting that Amazon is not even profitable and runs in incredibly competitive industries.  And, for every dollar they have to raise in costs they need to raise in profits.)<p>Your solution might work but has some concerns.  Although the market for unskilled work is very heavily weighted towards companies the market for skilled leadership is very competitive.  There is a reason top executives at Apple, Google and Amazon are paid well.  Paying 10,000 workers $1 an hour more means $20,000,000 less yearly to spend on upper level talent in a highly competitive marketplace for that talent.<p>I <i>am</i> pointing out the human respecting nature of the market exchange - that it respects human choice (no matter how bad or good an individuals choice may be) rather than implying the idea that someone else knows what is best.  Coercion is &quot;the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats&quot;.  I have never heard a story of Amazon threatening someone to work for them or using physical force to entice them to take a job. Taxes, military drafts and certain types of crime are coercion - posting on a job board is not.",1387220387

OS X is the last significant platform that gets this right by not trying to use Control for menu shortcuts out of the box.

If you build up a sufficient volume of customers, you can basically fund operations off of renewals, and invest all of your net new income in new R&D and development.<p>Many companies will renew support contracts for years, even if they&#x27;re not heavily using your software anymore, because the risk associated with their being out of support and then running into a critical issue is greater than the $100k it&#x27;s going to cost them to renew.  But if you&#x27;ve got 100 customers paying $100k/year to renew support, that&#x27;s $10m in basically guaranteed revenue, which means that <i>now</i> you&#x27;ve got some breathing room to plan and grow sensibly.

6916885,comment,6915495,6916434,1,0,Jemaclus,,,"I&#x27;m not quite sure the car argument holds water either. Cars are very heavily regulated for safety concerns and they routinely ship with airbags and are designed to collapse in ways that protect the driver. Most states also mandate wearing a seatbelt. So there&#x27;s precedent for mandating that operators of vehicles protect themselves. I don&#x27;t see a helmet as any different from a seat belt.<p>Furthermore, motorcycles require helmets, which is a more appropriate analogy than a car.<p>The difference between walking down the street, jogging, being in the bath, gardening, etc, versus riding a bike is a matter of velocity. If I&#x27;m jogging and I trip and fall, I&#x27;m not likely to land head first, nor am I likely to do much more than fracture a bone or bruise myself. While riding a bike, any sort of collision is likely to happen very quickly and with a lot of velocity, and as basic physics tells us, mass + acceleration = force. The faster you&#x27;re going, the more force is applied. With a crash on a bicycle, you&#x27;re much more likely to break bones (as opposed to fracture) and suffer concussions -- or worse. A helmet is just plain common sense at this point.<p>Better safe than sorry, imo. I&#x27;d rather risk getting stung by a wasp than get a concussion or possibly brain damage.<p>But hey, if you&#x27;re willing to risk it, then go for it. Not my problem.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m in favor of wearing helmets; I&#x27;m not in favor of mandating it.",1387219609

So if the prize has equal odds of being in any given door, then opening 99 of them gives you a 99% chance of finding the prize versus the 1% chance of only opening one door.

In the early days, we&#x27;d have $0 in bookings one month, and then next month, a check for $800k would come in.<p>Building an enterprise sales funnel is also a challenge.  It takes real discipline to be able to say &quot;100 leads->25 opportunities->5 POCs->3 deals at an ASP of 450k&quot;.  With consumer apps, the volume is so much greater that you can have conversations about A/B testing the homepage to drive a few extra percentage points - for enterprise apps, odds are not enough people will ever visit your website to be able to gather enough data to A/B test anything.<p>And deals will fall apart for the most random reasons - a regime change at a big bank.  A bigger company releases a product that uses some of the same words as yours, so the customer decides to evaluate it.  Your EU channel partner gets bribed to tank a deal by a competitor.  Anything can happen.<p>True story: we lost a deal once because the customer did a POC, and then fired the engineers who evaluated our software.  With the departure of the engineers who evaluated the software, management lost the use case doc and evaluation criteria that was used by the fired engineers, so they wrote a new use case doc without telling us, scored us based on the new doc (despite never having used our software), then had a competitor come in and execute their POC with the new engineers and new use case doc.  Unsurprisingly, the competitor &quot;won&quot;.   The call with the customer was amazing:<p>Them: You lost because of X, Y, and Z reasons<p>Us: Those weren&#x27;t use cases in the pilot, but even if they were, we can do those things<p>Them: Well...we didn&#x27;t know that you could do them.  But it doesn&#x27;t matter.  We picked the other guys.<p>Us: Where are the people who looked at our software?<p>Them: We had to let them go.  Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t have time to write a report before they left, so we based our evaluation of your software on your user manual.<p>This is one of the reasons why SaaS apps are so appealing on paper.  They have:<p>- Recurring revenue stream<p>- Freemium models allow leads to self-select<p>- Less sales friction (no need to send a sales engineer onsite, just spin them up a free 2-week trial)<p>But there&#x27;s still a ton of money to be made in on-premise enterprise software, it&#x27;s just a long, annoying, dangerous sales process.",1387218914

A data structure which does not lend itself well to immutability, such as a C-style array, can lead to very inefficient code when used in an immutable fashion. The C-style array or a variation thereof is also the default in most current languages, including Java, Python, C++, Ruby, and many others, so this is hardly a thing of the past.

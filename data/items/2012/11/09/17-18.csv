4763894,comment,4763484,4763827,8,0,spamizbad,,,"> 2. Polls attempt to account for the simple error that people are more likely to say that they'll vote than will actually vote. (see here: <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/111268/how-gallups-likely-voter-m..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/111268/how-gallups-likely-voter-m...</a>) The Romney campaign was predicated on the idea that GOP voters were likely to get out and vote, while Obama voters would say they were going to vote but then drop out on Election Day. That is a polling blind side that Nate Silver couldn't account for.<p>Actually Silver did account for something similar: That polls could be systematically biased against Romney.  Not for political reasons, but incorrect LV models.  The accurate pollsters of this cycle used an LV model that was shaped by 2008 exit polls.  Others used those based on 2004 or 2010 (Rasmussen).  Those that banked in this being an '04 or '10 electorate were way off.<p>He eludes to this here:\n<a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nov-1-the-simple-case-for-saying-obama-is-the-favorite/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nov-1-th...</a>\nand:\n<a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/oct-31-obamas-electoral-college-firewall-holding-in-polls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/oct-31-o...</a>",1352483678

4763888,comment,4762175,4763030,2,0,wyuenho,,,"Not to discredit Firefox for spearheading our revolt against the IE monopoly, but I think Firefox has sometimes been given too much credit for everything from standard compliance to innovation, and not enough credit to other browsers on the market.<p>First of all, standard compliance. I don't think Firefox 1.0 or its ancestors and subsequent version are all that standard compliant. Yes, for about 1 year in 2004-2005 it was the most standard compliant browser on the planet and could display most sites not written specifically for IE the way they were meant to be. But that drive to remain standard compliant quickly evaporated. When Safari 2.0 came out in 2005, it passed Acid2 and continued to be the most standard compliant, fastest browser on the planet with the cleanest code base for the next couple of years. And yes, it could render sites just as well as Firefox. Firefox OTOH, didn't pass it until 3.0 came out in 2008, and the second to last to pass Acid3.<p>Secondly, usability. I don't think Firefox from the day it came out to the present day is all that great in terms of UX. People seem to have forgotten that most of the browser UI features we take for granted came from Opera and later Chrome. Tabbed browsing? Opera first. Tab preview? Opera first. Most visited sites? Opera first. Tab groups? Opera first. Download Manager that speaks BT? Opera first. Mouse gestures? Opera first. The driver to innovative browser UI had always been Opera ever since IE dominated the market until Chrome came along in 2008 with its tab in title bar and omnibox. The only thing Firefox pioneered is the 3D view in the newer Firefox's inspect bar, which they somehow prioritized over consolidating all those overlapping and confusing developer tools, and making live editing in the markup panel possible, as in Firebug had been doing since 2007ish.<p>Third, under the hood innovation. Since the Netscape era to the present day I think the one most prevalent problem is misplaced focus. Mozilla simply has way too many sub-projects going on, not all of them important, and all of them compete for resources. Just look at how many man-hours Mozilla devs have wasted on technology that no one likes to use / can use but nevertheless bloat up Gecko. XPCOM, XUL, all those W3C alphabet soup X* standards in the early days, and then later on putting more and more JS features like let and generators into the JS engine. The APIs used to write extensions were a TERRIBLE mess before FUEL came out.<p>Lastly, speed, memory usage, and stability. Not until last year Firefox' launch speed was the slowest of all. It was unbearable and had not been addressed until very recently. Same for memory usages. In terms of JS exec speed and rendering speed, it was also among the slowest, only slightly faster than IE, though there has been significant improvement in this area as well this year. In terms of stability, it was not until recently that it got a boost using the same technique Chrome pioneered.<p>I can keep going on and on but the one thing that I cannot stress more is Mozilla's inability to focus on what's important. There was a time when Netscape had 80% of the market and Firefox a trend to break through 40% usage, but innovation stagnated while Safari, Chrome and Opera have continued to improve by leaps and bounds. There seems to have been many significant improvements to these problems recently  and I certainly hope to see more aggressive innovation and focus from the open source community around Mozilla.",1352483620

4763886,comment,4763484,4763823,7,0,ajross,,,"Well, it's probably better to say that the 10% included all known error estimations.  Given the skew between final polls and actual results seen over history, Silver's model figured it was 1 in 10 that some ""unknown"" factor would pollute the numbers enough to produce a Romney victory.  In this he was actually much more conservative than Sam Wang, who AFAICT looked only at the poll sampling error and arrived at a muc higher (e.g. 99%) chance of victory.<p>And actually, I think you can make the case that Silver was too conservative.  Looking at the results, the poll averages were well within sampling error in all battleground states.  And sorting the states by margin, Romney would have had to pick up FL, OH, VA and CO to win.  Obama won Colorado by 4.7% (not too far from the predicted ~3.5%, I believe), which is comparatively huge and absolutely not explainable by polling error (a Romney victory there looks like about three sigma to me).<p>In hindsight, the known state of the election on Tuesday morning was never winnable for Romney.  Wang was right (even though his averages came down on the wrong side in FL), Silver was too timid.",1352483603

4763870,comment,4763484,4763672,6,0,sjg007,,,"I agree.  I think Romney lost mostly because he flip-flopped.  I watched the Frontline episode called ""The Choice 2012"" and it was quite insightful.  The two candidates come across as quite similar in many policy/thinking respects.  Because Romney had to cater to the right wing fringe, the republicans essentially ate themselves.<p>Effectively, the country moved right because the republicans effectively shut Obama down and caused him to polarize. Basically negating the ""yes we can change"" hypothesis.  In 2008 people were sick of unilateral Bush action, the wars, and wanted people who would work together.  By the midterm elections fringe groups got super worked up about Obamacare and death panels. Tea party hyperbole basically, a very effective and vocal minority. In addition the vote for Obamacare was drawn down party lines which I believe contributed to the democratic losses.  It was a sign of not working together even though the republicans basically stonewalled the entire time.<p>Essentially, Obama, the great listener who could bring people together was shut out and shut down by politics.   \nHe was shutdown as an outsider essentially. We had hoped that an outsider could bring change, but the system itself refused to.  Romney himself was an outsider too but would have had the initial advantage of a republican congress.",1352483473

(We're going to assume through all of this that we're not even talking about minimal bugs or smooth, consistent performance, those should also be a given.)<p>Plus half of your first point was really your second point -- in essence, ""Getting People to Use Your App"" boils down to ""Figure out a strategy to get popular.""<p>Look, all I'm trying to say is that surely, with your background, you have more insight to offer than <i>""...make your app high quality. Hike up production value. Make it really good.""</i><p>Liiike??",1352483272

That whole story is not relevant to this person as an individual.<p>My point is that, but for the actions of our society in the 1930's an 1940's, there would be many more black Americans who could tell the same story as me. But systematic denial of privilege is passed down from generation to generation just as privilege is passed down from generation to generation, and that denial is the inheritance of every black American who can trace his ancestry back to those times.<p>Your attempt to create equivalencies between poor blacks and poor whites misses one crucial fact: our government did not systematically oppress and deny opportunity to the ancestors of poor whites. If the government burns down my house, then my neighborhood suffers flooding because of a hurricane, I am not made whole by the government addressing the flood damage.

Why ship bulky non-de-flatable balls from their manufacturing in China (presumably) or North America all the way to Sudan or Rwanda? All this is being run with donations anyway, right? Why not setup a ball-manufacturing unit somewhere in Africa? Something that uses the bare minimum of automation that still results in a decent product? Employ a few dozen/hundred locals, aid the economy, more or less solve the shipping problem. Its probably not easy, given political situation, but I am sure <i>some</i> location can be found out there? Won't that help even more?<p>I understand that something like the iPhone or a Tesla S cannot be manufactured out there.

The complexity of production is (presumably) much much lower than manufacturing an iphone, there isn't much of a concern for profit, labour would be as cheap in Africa as it is in China, if not cheaper, and periodic disruptions in production won't affect the stock price of any large corporation.<p>So why not?",1352483007

GOP had a consistent polling advantage on voter engagement, even going as far back as August. The Romney campaign placed a lot of stock on this. (see here: <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79665.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79665.html</a>) The polls might break for Obama, but the Romney campaign was banking on something else...<p>2. Polls attempt to account for the simple error that people are more likely to say that they'll vote than will actually vote. (see here: <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/111268/how-gallups-likely-voter-models-work.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/111268/how-gallups-likely-voter-m...</a>) The Romney campaign was predicated on the idea that GOP voters were likely to get out and vote, while Obama voters would say they were going to vote but then drop out on Election Day. That is a polling blind side that Nate Silver couldn't account for.<p>The Romney campaign didn't accurately test their engagement assertion. They relied on journalist polling, but engagement didn't turn into votes. The Obama campaign did the opposite: they targeted voters who might be disengaged and directly went after those with their GOTV efforts.<p>There is a HUGE debate that always goes on around election time with politicos around who matters more. Is it more important to try to sway independents (i.e., go after the middle), or is it more important to fire up your base? Romney won independents but Obama got the base turnout, indicating that a GOTV effort targeted at the base might have worked, had it been used effectively.

At the start of the Republican primary in 2011, Romney's fundraising wasn't aggressive, and it's unlikely his team prioritized a ""Big Data""  initiative from day 1. In the ensuing primary slugfest, Romney probably needed to put a ton of resources into advertising to win.  He also had a very large campaign payroll: his people were well compensated, but that didn't leave a lot money left-over for things like Orca.<p>Based on this conjecture, Orca probably got started sometime in the Spring, essentially giving the campaign 5-7 months to ship a bullet-proof GotV app.... alongside all the other stuff the team had to build (Tons of miscellaneous internal tools, the public mobile apps, etc).

Carriers have two obvious benefits  acquisition and/or retention of price sensitive users seeking free access to G+/Gmail/Google Search and acquiring users for data plans. Another benefit could be revenue sharing for lead generation via Googles ads.

Comparing the raw quantity of job postings (labor demand) across cities doesn't have much value. The suggestion you received in your last post about collecting this data over time was the best one you've gotten. Building on that, you need some way to proxy for the number of relevant job seekers in each location (and for each programming language in perfect world) because 10 times more jobs in city A than city B doesn't matter if there are 10 times more potential workers in city A. The other piece that you could think about adding is a way to detect when a job match occurred. Although it's far from perfect, a start would be doing something like inferring from recently removed Craigslist posts that ""Hey this post that used to be here is now gone. They must have found a job candidate."" Obviously it's a strong assumption since posts can be removed for a number of reasons, including ones that would lead to a false-positive under the assumption I just described. On the other hand, one metric you'd get out of your data if you setup the system this way is the length of time jobs across programming languages and cities remain active (e.g. ""Jobs for Python developers in Austin, TX appear to get filled N times faster than jobs for C# developers."") If nothing else, this time-based metric could be used to explain the supply side -- cities that fill jobs for a certain language faster on average may be doing so because there are more potential employees in that area. You could even use Google Trends data to see how trends for searches for ""python jobs"" or whatever in each city affects the story.<p>It's something to think about and play around with. I've read published economics research papers that used the ""post removed"" assumption in the market for used products on Amazon.com -- when a unique URL for a used product would disappear, the authors concluded that to be a sale [at the price it was last observed at].",1352481673

Solving the problem is the primary objective, but you can always go back and make your code better after the fact, learn new functions and techniques, etc.<p><a href=""http://projecteuler.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net</a>",1352480682

Hope that helps!",1352480668

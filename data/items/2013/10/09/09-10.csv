I recognize this sounds intuitively correct to a lot of people, but it&#x27;s not actually reflecting physical reality. The atoms making up my mind are not specially tagged.

It&#x27;s an easy mistake to make without realizing it. Our everyday intuition is not always a good indicator of physical reality.\nEveryday intuition suggest that there can only be one &quot;me&quot;. It suggests that consciousness is one unbroken process, and that my mind is a fundamentally static kernel. It suggests that I&#x27;m a black box with unknowable inner workings.

After living for some time, those two will diverge increasingly. That&#x27;s what living is, changing and developing.<p>So next after copying me, you want to kill me and you want to know if you&#x27;re thereby extending my life? That seems like a non sequitur statement. What do you mean by killing &quot;me&quot;, anyway? Killing both copies? Killing one copy? How does killing extend the life of anything?<p><i>> But there&#x27;s a biological system with a nearly identical behavior that&#x27;s living. That copy of you will have a similar conscious experience, but it won&#x27;t be you.</i><p>Okay, now we&#x27;re moving closer. The first mistake you make is assuming there&#x27;s an &quot;original&quot; and a &quot;copy&quot;. If they&#x27;re functionally identical, they&#x27;re both me in equal measures. Killing one is still murder, becoming more tragic the more time the two minds had to develop on their own.<p>Your are basing this example on the hidden assumption that a mind is trapped inside a body and forever bound to it, that a copy of my mind won&#x27;t be &quot;me&quot;. I recognize this sounds intuitively correct to a lot of people, but it&#x27;s not actually reflecting physical reality. The atoms making up my mind are not specially tagged. The information they represent can be copied in principle, and the process that is &quot;me&quot; can be executed on other platforms. In this, the assumption of uniqueness is just not applicable.<p><i>> That&#x27;s the point of the parent. The parent&#x27;s not talking about a soul.</i><p>I realize that &quot;soul&quot; is a loaded term. But in the end, you&#x27;re operating on those same loaded assumptions that seem obvious to yourself, but aren&#x27;t really compatible with a purely physical model. It&#x27;s an easy mistake to make without realizing it. Our everyday intuition is not always a good indicator of physical reality.<p>Everyday intuition suggest that there can only be one &quot;me&quot;. It suggests that consciousness is one unbroken process, and that my mind is a fundamentally static kernel. It suggests that I&#x27;m a black box with unknowable inner workings.

We run simulations of molecular interactions all the time. We can even &quot;do&quot; a cortical column in incredible detail.<p>The problem is not that we don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s possible. There are two issues concerning this development: we need to know what the right detail/abstraction level is for simulating a mind, and once we do we need to actually get that information. Doing the simulation itself is comparatively easy, though certainly not trivial.<p><i>> What exactly are you going to save to that file? Positions of molecules? States of atoms?</i><p>To be useful, it can&#x27;t be just a file, it needs to be a database that can be executed. Positions of molecules seems to be the right detail level according to our current understanding. That includes the spatial configuration of proteins and their exact position in relation to another. But there might not be that many unique molecules to store, just a few thousand maybe.<p>An interesting question then becomes how can we abstract these scans even further and still be able to have a high fidelity mind simulation?",1381309806

But the experiment is a 40-person study on Princeton students who solved three mathematical reasoning problems presented in either a normal typeface or a difficult-to-read typeface. Counterintuitively, the group that read in a difficult typeface scored higher on the reasoning problems than the group that read in a normal typeface.</i><p><i>In my review, I criticized Gladwell for describing this experiment at length without also mentioning that a replication attempt with a much larger and more representative sample of subjects did not find an advantage for difficult typefaces. One of the original study&#x27;s authors wrote to me to argue that his effect is robust when the test questions are at an appropriate level of difficulty for the participants in the experiment, and that his effect has in fact been replicated conceptually by other researchers. However, I cannot find any successful direct replicationsrepetitions of the experiment that use the same methods and get the same resultsand direct replication is the evidence that I believe is most relevant.</i><p><i>This may be an interesting controversy for cognitive psychologists, but it&#x27;s not the point here. The point is that Gladwell makes absolutely no mention of any uncertainty over whether this effect is reliable. All he does is cite the original 2007 study of 40 subjects and rest his case. As I mentioned in my review, in 2013 this is virtual malpractice for a sophisticated writer whose beat includes social science, where the validity of even highly cited results has come into question. Readers who have been hooked by Gladwells prose and look to the endnotes of this chapter for a new fix will find no sources for the &quot;hard stuff&quot;e.g., the true state of the science of &quot;desirable difficulty&quot;that he claims to be promoting.</i>",1381309370

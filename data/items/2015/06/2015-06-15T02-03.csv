I think most programmers who pay any attention to C++, Java, Scala, Clojure, Python, Ruby, Perl, or any other modern language can tell you a little bit about Lisp, because their language of choice has probably recently borrowed some Lisp features.

In my experience making your own compost (the stuff sold as compost in big box stores isn&#x27;t usually real compost) and using that as your primary fertilizer provides much better flavor. Compost making is an art in and of itself and I enjoy it as much or more than gardening. A properly built compost pile is quite fascinating as it heats up and breaks down organic matter at amazing rates.",1434337071

9717269,comment,9716625,9716625,0,0,OrdaGarb,,,"The whole thing seems fragile, both in terms of the physical properties and legalities. Some thoughts:<p>Cost: $1400 for $12 worth of parts obviously hacked together in a project box seems a bit much. While not for this specific application, it&#x27;s a really common project for people starting out with Arduinos: Arduino+ultrasonic sensor+display and a beeper. Usually used as a parking distance alarm in a garage. In this case the police add their own GoPro for evidence purposes I assume. Hopefully it clearly shows the position of the bicycle as well, and that he was fully to the right of the lane at the time of the measurement.<p>Safety: Could the possibility of a citation for uncertain margins with a bicycle cause the same nervous reactions that red light cameras cause possibly increasing the number of accidents?<p>Prior art: My car has an ultrasonic backup alarm with display and beeper that serves this exact purpose (measuring distance before impact). That was done in 2002, so not at all a new idea.<p>Value as evidence: Isn&#x27;t a common defense to speeding tickets the lack of recent calibration of the RADAR gun? This thing is probably subject to all manner of interference and inaccuracies.<p>Countermeasures: It could be easily jammed/confused by a transmitter designed for that purpose, and that should be legal since we&#x27;re talking about audio frequencies, and inaudible ones at that. Ever see those ultrasonic deer transducers that go on the bumper? They don&#x27;t work for deer, but they do emit sound in the ultrasonic range at certain speeds. I could see designing one specifically as a passive jammer mounted to the right-hand mirror.<p>My own experiences: I&#x27;ve biked thousands of kilometers in the US and been hit a few dozen times, nothing very serious. Some were my fault, most the driver&#x27;s fault. None were malicious, just poor observations/judgement/conditions. I ride defensively and don&#x27;t really care about these laws and behave as though they don&#x27;t exist since it&#x27;s not wise to count on the driver, and the driver shouldn&#x27;t count on me either.",1434336832

9717166,comment,9716783,9716977,0,0,jerf,,,"The interaction between community mechanics and the resulting political structures (e.g., &quot;threaded vs. nonthreaded comment sections&quot;, &quot;the effects of various moderation systems&quot;, various methods of giving out higher levels of privileges, etc.) has been a minor hobby of mine for ~15 years. Here&#x27;s one result I&#x27;ve noticed: Once you introduce <i>scale</i> into a community, in that way that only the Internet really can, you encounter certain major problems such that you end up with only two choices: Literally permit everything up to and including child porn and every other kind of skeevy thing ever, or engage in curation policies that somebody will, with a straight face, call censorship. And it&#x27;s not the obvious connection you&#x27;d think, either. It&#x27;s not that &quot;removing child porn&quot; will be called censorship (it will, but not by people that very many other people care about), it&#x27;s that you end up with a certain choice, and the result will inevitably be &quot;censorship&quot; by somebody&#x27;s accounting, and it&#x27;ll probably be a reasonable claim from many points of view.<p>Imagine you have a landscape of statements that could be made. Color some of it black for being unacceptable by your standards, color some of it white for being perfectly acceptable. No matter how you slice it, there&#x27;s some grey frontier in between. Throw a dart for every statement made by, say, 10 people in a week. A gentle smattering of darts appears. Maybe only a handful of statements will even be close to that grey line, and none of them land on it. Now throw a dart for every statement made by ten million people in a year. The landscape is no longer visible under the mass of the darts. Now tell somebody they have to go on to the field and clear out <i>precisely and exactly</i> the statements that are &quot;on the dark parts&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you slice it... someone&#x27;s gonna scream about how their message was removed.<p>And <i>that</i> metaphor implicitly includes the idea that we all agree on the colors. In reality, of course, we all wildly disagree, even if there are broad patterns within certain cultures that can be seen. [1]<p>The only two simple solutions to that problem, &quot;allow everything&quot; and &quot;allow nothing&quot; are respectively illegal (and at least arguably unethical), and pointless (what&#x27;s a community that allows 0 communication internally? I suppose one of those crazy logic puzzles about hat colors and wardens shooting prisoners. But that&#x27;s about it.).<p>This theory predicts that all communities at scale will have a set of people complaining about how it censors. This is more than just HN or Reddit, but anything, NYTimes, Usenet, a sufficiently large GitHub project, everything that doesn&#x27;t literally allow everything. I&#x27;m not aware of any counter-example....<p>So, given that it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to have a scaled community that doesn&#x27;t have people accusing it of censorship, it doesn&#x27;t seem all that interesting to abstractly accuse one of it. One would have to criticize it from a more specific point of view, like, is the stuff being removed significantly at odds with what the community it represents expects? Or is there perhaps an ethical standard that you&#x27;d like to specify that is <i>more specific</i> than merely &quot;shouldn&#x27;t &#x27;censor&#x27;&quot; that you&#x27;d like to discuss? That&#x27;s a serious question, BTW; I am not merely defending HN as a status-quo defender. Of course, the ethical standard will itself be up for debate. So it goes.<p>[1]: Standard metaphor warning: Don&#x27;t argue the metaphor. It&#x27;s just a metaphor. Neither the landscape, the colors, nor the darts exist, so there&#x27;s no way they could &quot;really&quot; have three colors or &quot;really&quot; be nasty fractals or &quot;really&quot; anything else.

Taking an example I know about, in Brazil, you can&#x27;t often tell who is going to try to take advantage of you (in business) but enough people have tried in your past that you come to the conclusion that everyone will at least try in the future, and therefore you act accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s really frustrating to have to treat people with your guard up when signing a contract or talking through specifics during a deal, but you learn to recognize advantage-takers and even to pretend you are one, too. In doing so, the other person will recognize they can&#x27;t pull the wool over your eyes either, which puts you both on a &#x27;level&#x27; playing field.<p>This isn&#x27;t just something I&#x27;ve experienced but also something I&#x27;ve been told by many others in Brazil. There&#x27;s even a &#x27;law&#x27; about it, called Gérson&#x27;s Law [1], which essentially states &quot;if there&#x27;s an opportunity to take advantage, go for it&quot;.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rson%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rson%27s_law</a>",1421790965

8919891,comment,8917078,8919292,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"You can buy bitcoins at Circle for free. And sell, too, at the same price. No spread obviously (as that would mean you can arbitrage, as their buy and sell price are exactly the same).<p>Volatility risk is inherent to every single currency. The swiss franc just had a 30% change in value. Bitcoin&#x27;s volatility is going down every year, look at the charts, and it makes sense, too. Deeper markets are harder to move. There&#x27;s nothing particularly unique about bitcoin that makes it volatile except its youth and nascent ecosystem. Over time its predictable supply curve makes it less volatile than most of the world&#x27;s currencies for most of the world&#x27;s population that don&#x27;t live in stable OECD economies with decent currencies. There are numerous countries with 10-20% inflation and wild swings.<p>Is bitcoin any better? Well again, its volatility is going down every year. But already you can go to Bitreserve and lock in the price to a dollar or euro or gold or yen or whatever value. So if you&#x27;re in Kenya, instead of 10% inflation, you just keep your money according to the dollar rate if you want, enabled by bitcoin.<p>Merchant fee? Bitpay offers 0% processing for all. Their most recent merchant taking bitcoin through Bitpay (at 0% fees) was Microsoft.<p>Transactions are instant, confirmation time can be mitigated as it&#x27;s a function of risk. Cup of coffee needs no confirmation time. Amazon needs no confirmation time. (if the customer double spends it, you simply cancel 15 minutes later and the item supposed to ship the next day won&#x27;t arrive.) Xbox Live needs no confirmation time. (account gets shut down after 10 minutes of trying to set up a multiplayer game of Halo, xbox gets fingerprinted and it and the ip gets blacklisted for fraud. Remember only the owner of bitcoin can double spend through careful effort, meaning you can be near certain fraud was intentional.) In short, virtually all of online retail has no real confirmation issues long term. And software solutions are in progress, there was one posted just last week, can&#x27;t find it atm.<p>Escrow: it&#x27;s just an insurance service, no reason there won&#x27;t be a company offering it. In fact escrow with timelocks and multi-sig already exist. It&#x27;s a bit of a long discussion but look into Mike Hearn&#x27;s presentations and articles on this, the short story is that with bitcoin you can get much better and fairer and more specific expert escrow services to fit your particular niche. Paypal and Amazon&#x27;s systems aren&#x27;t adequate and allow too much fraud and require too many costs.<p>Whether the customer or the merchant pays isn&#x27;t relevant, the customer ALWAYS pays, it&#x27;s not like the merchant will pay extra fees from his money-tree in his backyard. The customer pays. So if you have an expensive escrow system that screws over merchants and lets criminals chargeback lots of transactions stealing products essentially without paying and the merchant has to pay for expensive processes to get their product/money back, or let it slide, then the company will raise prices to make up for the losses or go out of business. Customers pay.<p>Same with creditcard theft. Oh you don&#x27;t have to pay if your CC gets stolen and someone spends $1k of your money? You still pay. Mastercard isn&#x27;t giving you $1k. They&#x27;re either taking it from the merchant (see above), or they&#x27;re paying you money out of revenues. Surprise, in both cases, you&#x27;re the source of revenue. Banking isn&#x27;t cheap, there are enough articles on this online just check &#x27;m out. A checking account averages about $200 a year? Credit is hugely overpriced? Paying 15-20% a year on credit when if I put money in a savings account I can barely get 0.5%? That&#x27;s obviously because there&#x27;s no peer-to-peer lending, if there was you&#x27;d both pay/get 10% and be better off by 10%. But people accept crazy rates on creditcards, why? Because the regular use is free or insured or promoted. All of those things you think are &#x27;free&#x27; or &#x27;cheap&#x27; are only such because you&#x27;re getting screwed in other areas of your financial services.<p>In short, creditcards are a 1950s invention that are hugely unsecure: people walk around with plastic cards with their freaking entire password (doubles as an account number) printed on it. And everytime you want to pay, you show your password. It&#x27;s insane. And then if something goes wrong, you charge it back. All of this costs money, there&#x27;s a ton of theft and fraud with this system and the customer ends up paying for it. You&#x27;re deluding yourself if you think that&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s like getting a free razor and being oblivious to the fact you&#x27;re paying a shit ton on the blades.",1421790695

It&#x27;s trying to solve a specific task for chess board analysis. Nor did it reject that Hadoop was always the wrong solution, only that a single node <i>can</i> be faster than Hadoop. An existence proof is a low barrier to cross.<p>You say &quot;this is a different scenario&quot; and I have to shrug. I used to do molecular dynamics distributed across a compute cluster or using a supercomputer. That&#x27;s yet another different scenario, and also one where Hadoop doesn&#x27;t work. Last I heard, simulation software I helped write now runs across 8,400 cores. (See <a href=""http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/gpu/files/gtc2013_phillips.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/gpu/files/gtc2013_phillips.p...</a> .) The visualization project I used to lead now analyzes 100+ TB of simulated trajectory data. (See <a href=""http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S4410-visualization-analysis-petascale-moledular-sims.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S441...</a> .)<p>MD definitely falls into &quot;Big Data&quot;, yet the examples I gave don&#x27;t use Hadoop or data partitioning like you suggest, so your statement about Big Data frameworks is really restricted to only a subset of what people do in Big Data.<p>So yes, you&#x27;re right. The original essay isn&#x27;t complete. Neither is this new one, which didn&#x27;t include all the problems with Hadoop, like poor inter-node latency, and lack of support for MPI. The &#x27;real choice&#x27; isn&#x27;t as dichotomous as you make it out to be. A set of powerful non-commodity hardware, like Blue Waters, may be the right approach for some scenarios.<p>&quot;Without the complete picture&quot;<p>I disagree. The new essay gives a different picture. A lot of pictures fit well in the frame of Hadoop, for the reasons given in the new essay.<p>In this case the pictured scenario is chess data analysis. In this case it looks like a single node is faster. However, it&#x27;s not <i>better</i> for the original original task, which was to experiment with learning Hadoop. (&quot;I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR.&quot;) As the original original spec no longer exists, I cannot tell if fault-tolerance was one of them. As it was a personal learning project, no doubt it wasn&#x27;t.<p>So this new essay is adding details that weren&#x27;t relevant to the original task, then complaining that the details weren&#x27;t addressed. This is poor form.<p>You ask &quot;how can you say when you need one, ten or 100&quot; and the easy answer is to go ahead and implement it on one node. If it takes an hour to write a single node solution would take, and it&#x27;s fast enough for your foreseeable needs, then you&#x27;re a lot better off than spending a day to try out a Hadoop solution. Plus, without the single node solution it&#x27;s hard to know if you have a good baseline.",1421790633

One need only consider the once shocking, now common practice of pubic hair removal to understand this. That cat is out of the bag, so to speak.<p>And not all porn is like the porn you&#x27;re describing. Erotic literature and comics are quite popular with the younger generations, which manage to depict outlandish fantasies and fairly normal sex within caring relationships with surprisingly similar frequency. Not to mention, if you consider things like crossdressing and transexual porn, one person&#x27;s kink can be another&#x27;s lifeline. To censor all porn, apart from being reprehensible on the grounds of freedom of speech, is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<p>As for 4 year olds, I actually don&#x27;t think they need to be worried about. I grew up with the internet, so naturally I stumbled across porn a few times before I hit puberty. I remember being quite surprised at first, but I got over it pretty quickly. I said &quot;gross,&quot; clicked back, went back to surfing the web and playing video games, and never really thought about it or sought it out again until the hormones kicked in. Of course that&#x27;s an anecdote, but I think finding porn as a kid is about as inconsequential as walking in on your parents having sex.<p>What people <i>should</i> be fucking terrified about is the popularity of camera and GPS-equipped smartphones that your naive kid can use to post geotagged selfies up for the entire world to see, making it trivial for predators to stalk them.

At worst, it&#x27;s required multiple emails because things were broken.<p>For online credit card purchases, it&#x27;s been as easy as clicking a single button (Saved CC info), and having everything simply work.

8919647,comment,8917078,8917436,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Haha yeah it is ironic. For people who want a bit of nuance (it&#x27;s certainly true what he said, just not the whole truth) here&#x27;s some additional thoughts.<p>One is that the paradox of bitcoin adoption is that it can&#x27;t take off without a normal banking system. And if you had a decent banking system, you wouldn&#x27;t need bitcoin in the first place.<p>That is, fraud is a big issue in online retail. You buy product X online and then you &#x27;charge back&#x27; your transaction and end up with a free product. Merchants then have to solve this by starting legal cases and provide evidence that a product was supplied blablabla. Sometimes this costs more than it&#x27;s worth. Bitcoin faces a lot of these problems, too. How do you acquire bitcoin? You can&#x27;t through Paypal because of this fraud, everyone charges it back and Paypal mostly ignores evidence that bitcoin was indeed supplied. As a seller you can&#x27;t really make a case and win.<p>So you end up with these big companies that act a bit like banks. They require you to verify your identity, your residence, bank account etc. All to prevent fraud. And of course all of that has costs, so they charge you 1%. And then you pay them not through a credit card, that&#x27;s 2.5% in fees which doesn&#x27;t work if you pay $100 to get $100 of bitcoin. So you pay through ACH, which takes a few days but is cheap.<p>So you end up with a service that sells you bitcoin for 1% that takes a few days. Why? Because there&#x27;s no way to safely send money cheaply and instantly without fraud, which is what bitcoin allows you to do and solves.<p>So the paradox is, if everyone had bitcoin, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. But they don&#x27;t, so we need banks. But if banks worked well, we wouldn&#x27;t need bitcoin.<p>Over time this becomes less of an issue of course. This is what made Coinbase big, not its storage, but its exchange function for US customers. As a wallet, it&#x27;s not the biggest, Blockchain.info which does not see your private keys (it&#x27;s a software layer) has almost a million more wallets. So it&#x27;s big for its exchange function which has little to do with centralized or decentralized storage of money.<p>The second part is centralized storage. This is a function of culture and software sophistication. In the early days most bitcoin software wasn&#x27;t user friendly and not very well written. Today we&#x27;re seeing changes. In fact, Coinbase has a multi-sig product, which is a software solution allowing you full autonomy over your money, and Coinbase none. That&#x27;s not centralized storage, users retain full control over their private keys and Coinbase offers the software to facilitate it, much like how an Excel sheet facilitates your personal data analysis but doesn&#x27;t award Microsoft ownership of your data. Over time we&#x27;ll see products like this emerge more and more and people will have a choice to move away from centralized storage, and culture may shift towards that, too.<p>In short though, bitcoin wasn&#x27;t about &#x27;never use a centralized company&#x27;. It&#x27;s about a protocol layer that&#x27;s not proprietary, with a currency that can&#x27;t be forged or printed to fuel political agendas (like militaristic foreign policy). The fact that centralized and decentralized solutions become available on top of that layer is both fine. Much like how a decentralized internet would be awesome despite the fact it would still see centralized repositories of data like Facebook, it&#x27;s not about which services become most popular as long as the underlying network remains free and open.",1421788538

That&#x27;s what TSATOP really explains - how to quantify the seemingly minute differences in your offering, and how to communicate that value to the customer so that you can charge accordingly.<p>To use an example actually from the book, how much money will a DNA testing kit that requires 10% less sample material be worth to a customer?<p>Well, first that depends on who the customer is - its a lot more valuable to a pharma company than a university, for example. But how much more? The book would do something like calculate the number of new drugs the pharma company can release each year based on having this better DNA testing kit, and calculate how that affects the customer&#x27;s bottom line. Eventually this would result in something like: every time you use our product instead of our closest competitor, it puts $50 in your pocket.<p>Seth Godin&#x27;s writing is awesome for motivation and to get your brain moving, but this book really drills down on the nuts and bolts of pricing, and provides templates and worksheets for performing your own Economic Value Estimation of your product.

We wanted to know the detectability of the Shadow at mission altitude so we could adjust things to keep from getting shot down. For those that don&#x27;t know, the Shadow 200 (RQ-7A, now superseded by a bigger model), is built out of a carbon fiber composite with radar absorbing paint. The engine vents exhaust to the top backwards directly into the propellor, which does a wonderful job of breaking up the heat signature. It is approximately 11&#x27;x13&#x27;. Anyways the shadow is small and was meant to have a very low detectability factor. After the AV is a few thousand feet above the ground, you can either see nor hear it. Our own patriot anti aircraft battery was unable to detect it at mission altitude without setting their gear&#x27;s sensitivity up night enough to detect large birds, which is totally impractical.<p>So was the Shadow built to be stealth like a B2 or F117? Nope. Is it effectively stealth when flying missions at several thousand feet above the ground? Yup! Go the the Wikipedia page for &quot;Ground Control Station&quot; which has a picture of me in the back of a Shadow GCS sometime around 2001.<p>Now the bigger stuff such as the predator / reaper / global hawk? They have much larger cross signatures, but they are more capable platforms. The shadow only had an approximately 6-7 hour in-air endurance.",1421788103

8919568,comment,8916379,8916379,0,0,programminggeek,,,"I&#x27;m going to say that the bigger problem in dynamic languages isn&#x27;t that they are dynamic. It&#x27;s that they have weak, nonexistant, or very undeveloped mechanisms for creating strong communication protocols that you can depend on as safe or reliable.<p>Take the classic case of SQL injection. You have string input into your system that turns into string input into a SQL query that turns into string input to a database. That is dangerous because if you don&#x27;t check on what the input string contains, it might contain nothing, or a semicolon, or it might not be a string at all!<p>We understand that putting a string direct into a SQL statement is dangerous at this point, but we have yet to fix its root cause - nonexistant protocols or boundaries in most code we write.<p>What a static language changes in that regard is compiler checked type signatures on  your code. That generally stops you from say passing an Integer into something that needs a String. That solves a certain class of problems for sure, and the complier does it for you every time you change your code, so there is a convenience there.<p>What static typing doesn&#x27;t give you is actual data correctness. Things like buffer overflows or SQL injection can still happen with static typing. You could use a language like Scala or Haskell to have stronger/more complex types that would have more distinct notion of value correctness and at that point the complier would be doing most of the work to ensure your program is correct.<p>Leaning on a type system in that regard is basically turning your types into the protocols that determine correctness in your system.<p>It is also possible to lean on stronger protocols that check messages in a dynamic languages to achieve largely the same thing.<p>In the end, to write safe, high quality software, you need to define the communication protocols between methods/functions/routines/services and enforce them much as you would with an externally facing REST api.<p>The difference between a dynamic system with dynamic protocol checking vs a static system with compiler type checking is the mechanism you are using to enforce the protocol and how easy it is to interact with it.<p>Dynamic systems might be easier to interface with externally because you don&#x27;t have to understand a complex type, just pass a Hash/Dictionary sort of like a JSON API, vs a static system where you need to use the right types and so on, similar to a SOAP/WSDL API.<p>Performance is also a consideration, but really when you compare static vs dynamic, it is important to understand that at the end of the day you can write Ruby/Python/PHP that is functionally equivalent to C/C++/Java. They are all ultimately going to be able to do the same kinds of things.<p>The tradeoff is in how they solve the problem and how well that fits with the team writing the software.",1421787963

It makes it hard to make friends as I lack people and social skills. It gave me an advantage to make me high functioning enough to learn programming at a young age and work with math and science better than average.<p>I am not a mean person, when people get to know me I am nice. But I have few friends because I lack social and people skills. I cannot seem to emotionally connect with people and what friends I have are also with a high IQ that I connect to intellectually.<p>When I worked, I worked with some mean people. They found high functioning coworkers of mine and pretended to be their friend and then stabbed them in the back and forced them to quit because they were competition. They took credit for their work and then decided to target me next. Calling me a nerd and geek, making fun of me, bullying and harassing me even with threats of violence trying to force me to quit. I ended up stressed out and developed a mental illness and was forced on disability.<p>Based on Linkedin those mean people who did all of that still have their jobs. They have social skills and people skills and use it to manipulate people, and then black-stab them and climb the corporate ladder of success. Until they make it to management where they can bully and harass people to do their jobs. All the while keeping their dark side hidden.<p>If you ever worked for Steve Jobs, you would say he was a jerk, he was abusive to his engineers to get things done just right. He had anger problems too. But he had the social skills and people skills to be well liked. There are a lot of people like Steve Jobs out there.<p>I&#x27;ll most likely never work again due to my mental illness, but I am not a mean person, I don&#x27;t treat people with disrespect, I don&#x27;t bully and harass them. But due to lacking people and social skills, I&#x27;ll never have enough friends to become a success.",1421787949

The first-line phone operators are pretty bad -- they're neither technical nor fluent in English -- but we've been able to work up to competent people pretty quick in the one emergency we've had since launching. Both organizations are courting us pretty hard, so we may be a special case.<p>Google is a little weird. They've insisted on e.g. a conference calls with a half-dozen guys from Google, including one executive-level. That call was entirely one-sided. They told us about all sorts of features they were building because they thought our market segment needed them (zero of which were actually useful to us, and which they could have discovered with even very minimal market research). In that conference call, they didn't listen to any of our bugs or feature requests. Whenever we've submitted support requests through official channels, they went into what was effectively a black hole (sometimes, we'd get a slightly derogatory response from someone clearly powerless and clueless). Things we submit to through high-level contacts get handled -- roughly as well although slightly slower than normal, paid contacts at Amazon. The culture at Google is a little weird, at least with respect to dealing with large customers.<p>We do use Google Apps internally. It's imperfect and has showstoppers, but in my experience, corporate IT departments are even more imperfect, and have even more showstoppers. Based on our experiences, I'd be absolutely terrified of using Google for anything customer-facing.",1341421054

I'm doing my best to describe my confusion.<p>I have no clue how to use Git, and I've been trying to wrap my head around it for a while.  Unfortunately, this is yet another tutorial that is very frustrating even though it's designed to target noobs like myself.<p>So, I added octocat.txt to my staging area.  Success! ... Wait.  Why do I care?  What did I do? Staging what, for what? Huh?<p>I committed some random text.  Or something.  And I typed ""-m"".  So does ""git commit -m 'something random'"" actually do something?  What did I commit to? Arrrggg.  Why did I -m !?<p>Then there's this one: git commit -m 'Add all the octocat txt files'<p>So it understands plain English?  Was that the random text?  Is that just some sample text as part of the Tutorial or does that actually work on Git?  Oh man, I'm now more confused than when I started.<p>...<p>Anyway, for some reason, everyone who tries to describe Git already has such a strong understanding of it and it's oddities, that they are, for some reason, unable to lay it out properly for a noob IMO.  I cannot figure out how anyone figures out Git, I assume there was some serious hand holding, because I'm just not grasping it and I usually ""get"" this stuff rather quickly.  Maybe that's the problem, Git isn't something you can just pick up quickly, maybe I need to buy a huge Git how-to book like the old days.<p>Sincerely,\nFrustrated in Programming Land.",1341420897

Which should hopefully be happening now.<p>I can't speak for GitHub (I'm from the Code School team that built this), but we were very cautious not to introduce too many concepts in that course (you can see below someone saying it's too basic, yes, that's the point), simply the absolute basics we thought people would need to know to understand Git. We also did our best to not introduce Unix concepts, which open another can of worms.<p>The point is that a very large amount of people working on and around the web today are terrified of the command line. There are plenty of tools that attempt to abstract away the Git command line interface, and our goal with Try Git was not to do that. To give people the real Git experience and try to ease them into it.<p>I'm sure we can improve it over time to ensure that fewer people ""freeze"" in front of a command line. You're right that we may need to be more explicit as to what people should do after entering a command, but we need to stay as consistent as possible with the actual command line.<p>Please feel free to give more feedback, I'll be going through everything that's posted here.<p> Olivier Lacan",1341420595

The market for >200 digital boxes is just too small and completely dwarfed by the TV market.  Samsung, LG, Sony and Panasonic will each sell many more TVs each year than the total size of the >200 PVR market and even if only 30% connect to their Internet platforms they will all still be bigger platforms and more attractive to content than Youview (despite its greater flexibility).<p>The other problem is that Youview is two and half years late (originally named Project Canvas and planned for November 2009) and it has missed virtually the entire country completing the Digital Switchover (analogue switch off), 3 Christmas sales peaks, 1 World Cup (soccer) sales peak, 1 Euro Cup (soccer) sales peak and now will be going on sale at the exact time the Olmypics starts without the retailers having time to get ready.  Also gadget spend is increasingly moving to tablets rather than TV boxes at the moment.<p>I also have very serious doubts about UK retailers ability to sell this.  Most can't get TV aerial signals OR even Internet connections into the TV areas of their stores.  Most PVR type products sit on shelves not connected to TVs and can't be demonstrated.<p>It has two chances of any traction: BT and Talk Talk, (significant Telcos) will use it for their TV platforms.  Talk Talk hasn't even entered the market yet and BT has been trying for years almost giving away boxes with phone service but has little over half a million subs(may be slightly old figure) compared with 10M using Freeview (OTA), 10M using Sky (pay satellite) and 5M using Virgin (cable).  If they make a competent go at the market and heavily subsidise it the total Youview platform could conceivably reach 1M.<p>The other chance it has is if a profile can be developed suitable for TVs (without HDD) and a major player in the TV market can be persuaded to include across their range they could really ramp up the numbers.",1341420069

Even git repositories and local code uses the same depency-declaring format: A standard gemspec. Otherwise bundler just stays out of the way to do it's main job - dependency resolution. There is no such thing as two package formats in the ruby world. There is now in the PHP world - PEAR and Composer (and zip and tarfiles). PEAR has always been severely lacking - no way to install two versions of the same PEAR package, improper dependency-tracking - so I guess that's required. It's probably a huge step forward, but it's still not ""better"" to be able to track two package formats ""with just a little extra configuration"" instead of ""it works just fine without extra work with the default package format.""

When goods are both non-rivalrous and non-excludable, they tend to be underproduced in a market economy. One solution would be for the state to produce such goods (e.g. in the UK, the BBC).

It may be more cost-effective for them to focus entirely on the mass-market side, where they've proven they're extremely competent (among the best in their industry), and let others figure out the smaller volume stuff. But, maybe a marketplace would be cool/profitable.

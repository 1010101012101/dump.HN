Not for anything &quot;production worthy&quot;, but the tool I built is seeing at least monthly use at my company, seems relatively stable (hasn&#x27;t broken yet), and was way easier (for me at least) to write than the same app when I originally wrote it in Angular.<p>I had a bit of trouble convincing it to redraw when I though it should, and ended up throwing in way more m.redraw()&#x27;s than I probably should have, but it works, it&#x27;s responsive, it&#x27;s <i>fast</i> (if you couldn&#x27;t tell that already from it&#x27;s benchmarks), and it&#x27;s <i>fun</i> (for me at least).<p>*Note: I haven&#x27;t bothered looking into React yet, so I have no real comparison between the two.

Many people think that killing in defense of property is okay, and many people disagree with that first set.   I could go on and on.<p>In the country where I live, most killings are auto crashes.

Usually when comparing two languages, one exhibits simplicity in one area where the other exhibits simplicity in another and it all roughly balances out. Humans seem to demand approximately a constant level of complexity from their languages. English for example has pretty complicated consonant clusters (e.g. hurdle, or angsts) to make up for fewer syllables.

I&#x27;m not sure it would change the result as much as you think, though.  The basic finding of the paper is that coverage is a complicated way of measuring the size of the suite.  Counting the number of times each line is hit will have the same problem, I think: writing more tests increases that score but also increases the number of bugs found, causing a spurious correlation.<p>My hunch is that the quality of the oracle matters more than the coverage score.  You can write tests that cover all the code without actually checking anything; the tests will only catch bugs if you&#x27;re carefully comparing expected and actual results.  Maybe a simple metric like &quot;number of asserts&quot; would be useful -- except, of course, that will also be correlated with the size of the suite...

Perhaps a binary rating system is a better forcing mechanism to determine quality?<p>But since we&#x27;re stuck with the five star system...here is how I leverage Yelp review data when it comes to selecting a small business to patronize:<p>1. Normalize for the true Yelp rating scale of 4 - 4.5 stars.  Filter out anything below a 4 star rating.  If a small business is unable achieve 4 stars on Yelp, then something must be really wrong.<p>2. Quantity of reviews is important.  For starters, you need a significant sample size of review data for the star rating to be meaningful.  Further on the review quantity front: massive review numbers relative to other similar businesses in that given city is a good signal of popularity (though not necessarily quality).<p>3. You need to supplement your Yelp findings from points 1 and 2 with other sources, ideally critical reviews (e.g. Eater, Serious Eats, Time Out, NY Times, Chicago Mag, etc).<p>4. The content of individual Yelp reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.  Your individual priorities and tastes might be radically different so there is limited value in an individual&#x27;s rating.  I&#x27;ve come across some truly great restaurants with 1-star reviews because the reviewer tried to dine at the restaurant on a Monday...when it was closed.",1448905609

I think the problem with distinguishing between the two is that &quot;coverage&quot; is defined, so to speak, as an area.<p>Once an LOC is executed by any test, its value ticks over once. It never gets counted again.<p>If instead each LOC execution was summed up independently, each LOC gets a &quot;height&quot; -- the number of times it was exercised in a suite. Then the overall suite gets test coverage <i>volume</i>, rather than test coverage <i>area</i>.<p>Once you track per-LOC volumes, you could start trying to tease out the differences between introducing a test <i>at all</i> and adding another test to critical code.<p>And, I suspect, the correlation between coverage <i>volume</i> and bug yield would be much more robust than area when controlled for number of cases. Because area when controlling for number of cases is ... a rough proxy for test coverage volume.<p>Edit: though with an interesting difference. Coverage area converges to 100%, but coverage volume is effectively unbounded. This would hopefully upset the abuse of coverage as a management metric instead of as a code smell.",1448905275

Some googling indicates the green revolution plus industrialization plus factory farms has temporarily quintupled grain production per acre, well, absolute best case anyway.  So assuming world productivity was solely focused on rice ag (cheapest calories there is... right?) then every human on the planet consumed 2000 calories per day of rice and absolutely nothing else happened.

Once that correction is made, the data could be re-run to gather actual, useful results.  Or rather than using inflation adjusted counters, just pick a valuable commodity like gold.

Publicly stating anyone accused of a crime has no rights as a judge and then proceeding to take them away is not even close to comparable to following the law and letting people free on bond and having them commit crimes. One is an unfortunate aftereffect of having a justice system that does not simply execute everyone, one is the wholesale destruction of the rule of law and every protection citizens have. It&#x27;s worrying to me that you would even draw that equivalence for the purpose of argument.<p>Not long ago there was a story about a head prosecutor in Louisiana who was a member of the KKK and was quoted as saying something to the effect of &#x27;God wants me to punish black people, my only regrets are that the black people I executed didn&#x27;t suffer more&#x27; who unsurprisingly fabricates evidence constantly.

And not just for the sake of software verification. Sometimes when proving a non-CS-type-math theorem you still want an efficient implementation of an existence proof.<p>But code synthesis is a lot harder than merely being constructive, and efficient code synthesis even more so. Use cases for Coq that depend upon code synthesis don&#x27;t come for free just by avoiding LEM. So although it&#x27;s fair to say that you can do classical reasoning in Coq, I&#x27;m not sure saying you can do synthesis from TLA+ if only you avoid LEM is fair at the moment (I might be wrong).<p><i>> Are there any advantages to using dependent types?</i><p>Here are a few other reasons for using Coq:<p>* Proof terms. There are two major disagreements here. The first grounds out in philosophy and the second basically amounts to &quot;you really want to compose the proofs and make sure they are still a proof instead of just throwing away the proof and using the theorem&quot; which has lots of good systems-y justifications<p>* Specifically wrt TLA+, Modus Operandi matters. If you want a formal proof in the typical sense of the word (rather than a verification of fact based upon model checker output), then Coq userlands&#x27;s tactics and theorems are useful.<p>* Lots of people like to disparage the amount of algebra that FPers talk about. But it turns out that if studying those algebraic structures is your day job, the relationships between types and algebraic structures makes type theory convienant.<p><i>>simpler, more familiar</i><p>This is almost definitionally subjective. Which isn&#x27;t meant as a criticism, in-so-far as one realizes that other people might have different experiences and so might (just as validly) consider other formalisms more familiar.<p><i>> and more flexible</i><p>There are (obviously) a lot of people who fundamentally disagree with the concrete arguments Lamport makes in this paper. I wish someone would annotate the paper with references to literature from the type theory community that address some of his concerns.<p>For the record, I don&#x27;t disagree with Lamport. I think Lamport is <i>right</i> -- for some use cases, it certainly makes sense to stick with ZF. But he&#x27;s also <i>wrong</i> -- sometimes, the type theoretic approach really is simpler, more familiar, and more flexible. E.g., in the case of this dissertation.",1448904027

If you hook up that transistor wrong or short the circuit it&#x27;s game over.<p>I actually think you can even damage the board if you create a short between the gpio pins and ground. So any kind of circuit requires a resistor, carefully reading the system manual and data sheets for your components and using ohm&#x27;s law prior to hooking up components.",1448903883

I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if neurogenesis occurs throughout the whole brain, in response to proper stimulus.  I suspect that the reason it doesn&#x27;t generally occur is that it is more efficient to grow new synapses between existing neurons than to differentiate stem cells into new neurons.<p>By analogy, muscles can undergo a fairly good amount of hypertrophy just via protein synthesis of contractile elements.  However, in response to severe stress/trauma, satellite cells (a form of quiescent, partially differentiated stem cell) merge with muscle cells; the result of this is a muscle cell with a greater potential for hypertrophy.<p>Perhaps neurogenesis and only occurs under special conditions (like muscular myonuclear addition), such as extremely novel stimulus, or great mental effort.

It took me months to get it to a usable state.<p>Why didn&#x27;t you return it and get -say- a Thinkpad? (Were you -perhaps- just curious how shitty the &quot;Ubuntu Certified Laptop&quot; program is?) It clearly failed the &quot;Fitness for advertised purpose&quot; test. AFAIK -if you&#x27;re in the US- the seller can&#x27;t refuse to accept your return... unless it was sold as-is.<p>> I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy a Linux laptop again, but if I do, I&#x27;ll be sure to try it hands-on before buying.<p>I&#x27;ve found great success with the following method:<p>* Get a detailed list of the parts inside a given laptop. (lspci info from the target model is a <i>really</i> good sign)<p>* Run screaming if the video card is made by Nvidia. [0]<p>* Find if there are in-tree kernel drivers for each of the parts. (If there are, this is a <i>really</i> good sign.)<p>* Find the out-of-tree drivers for the remaining parts, and see if there are solid plans to get them in-tree. (If there are any such plans, that&#x27;s a good sign.)<p>* Discover the known issues for all of those drivers.<p>* If the drivers seem to do everything that I need them to, and the known issues list doesn&#x27;t contain any show-stoppers, the laptop will likely work just fine. :)<p>[0] I know that this is a controversial opinion. I&#x27;ve had <i>awful</i> luck with the nouveau driver and <i>really</i> bad luck with the official Nvidia driver. Other people haven&#x27;t.

10814610,comment,10812198,10812198,0,0,pklausler,,,"IMO the essence of programming is the definition of abstract interfaces and the composition of components within a context according to those interfaces.  The essence of <i>functional</i> programming is the composition of components that create their results without modifying their execution context in any way that could be detected by a failure of referential transparency.<p>With that definition, functional programming is a style, not a class of languages.  An assembly routine that computes a cosine is a functional program.  I typically write C/C++ code in a functional style, constructing and returning new data structures rather than modifying arguments in place, because it&#x27;s so much easier to test, use in parallel code, and reuse later.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that strong typing, higher kinds, higher order functions, algebraic types, pattern matching, anonymous closures, polymorphism, or garbage collection, e.g., are necessary to functional programming (although they&#x27;re all wonderful and Haskell seems to have collected just the right mix of features together into a language that I love using whenever I can).  It&#x27;s about whether or not your components have interfaces that are like mathematical functions.",1451512500

10814599,comment,10813341,10814132,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I <i>do</i> suffer from PTSD and I find trigger warnings deeply unhelpful. If anything, they raise my blood pressure and short circuit the process of reading context for potential stressors, which is IMHO very necessary for managing and eventually recovering from stress.<p>I see three problems with trigger warnings. One is that some people have developed a habit of writing &#x27;trigger warning for blah&#x27; at the beginning of something and then just going on to vent or throw the literary equivalent of a pity party, which readers are implicitly forbidden to criticize in any way. Another is that the worthy purpose of warning others about the potential for offence can easily degenerate into social engineering in the hands of an unscrupulous person. One form of this is to demand special treatment, while another form is to deliberately trigger anxiety in others while evading responsibility for it by pointing to existence of the trigger warning.<p>The biggest problem by far though is that <i>anything</i> could be triggering to <i>someone</i> - like a perverse version of rule 34, if it exists there is a traumatic version of it. This is the entire basis of the horror movie genre: you take something that looks innocuous and make it into something scary by juxtaposing it with something awful, in order to create suspenseful dread the next time you see the innocuous thing. This is why creature features aren&#x27;t really horror movies; while it&#x27;s horrific to depict someone eaten by a shark or a giant bear or whatever, you already know those things are dangerous and if they show up you are in trouble. So while you might feel scared watching <i>Jaws</i>, you knew from the outset that you were (vicariously) going into a hazardous situation, and conversely that you can avoid scary encounters with hungry sharks by not swimming in the ocean or visiting aquariums. But if I show you a movie where, I dunno, playing certain chords on an old piano can summon an evil spirit* and the movie is convincingly scary, then you&#x27;ll get a little shudder every time you see a piano lurking in the corner of the room.<p>* this seems like a pretty stupid premise, but in medieval times certain dissonant note combinations were avoided in western church music because the harmonic instability was considered too evil-sounding. A modern parallel is to sing a well-known children&#x27;s song in a minor key, which invariably sounds creepy.",1451512352

One way specialization dies is by making it cheaper to dis-intermediate and eliminate the specialization.  Soon, it&#x27;ll be too expensive for all but the rich to own clothes washers that run for more than a year.

In that way it&#x27;s a symptom of decay, not really evil.

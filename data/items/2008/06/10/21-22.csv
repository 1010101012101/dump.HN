The Darwin kernel descends much more directly from NeXT's mach-based product.  It grew SMP support only very recently, and via a very different path from that taken in the monolithic BSD community.<p>Honestly, I don't understand why Apple continues to work on their own kernel.  It has near zero competitive advantage relative to FreeBSD or Linux, and much cost a fortune to maintain.  The real value of their product has always been above the kernel anyway: I have to believe that switching the kernel out for a more robust Unix variant can only be a good thing for the Mac.",1213134983

Everyone is different.<p>My personal experience, which I would not curse upon my own worst enemy: I am in my late 30's and have a family, mortgage, a mountain of bills, and zero savings. What I did have was the passion, drive, and a incredible knack for shifting debt around via a variety of 0% interest credit card offers.<p>So in a nutshell I kept my day job, did as much of the grunt work myself (overall architecture, protoypes, server config and setup, performance tuning, etc) and shifted the rest offshore to some developers in Eastern Europe. My typical work week is 70 hours which sounds brutal, but a combination of a 3 hour train commute + a 3G Data Card means I can get a lot of work done instead of watching movies on my ipod. Also, while I can't quite figure out why I haven't flatlined, I still somehow find the time to be a good father and husband, though I barely remember what it was like when I had time to catch up on TV or twitter.<p>Would I have preferred to go full time? Hell yes. Would it have been easier if I was not bootstrapped and was spending other people's money? Of course. However, all that matters is my service is somewhat established, and while tiny is growing strong. If I can do what I have done in the last 12 months, than anyone can.",1213133843

214320,comment,214146,214227,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>your iPhone or other new gadget won't be invented in years, months or weeks, but hours or minutes. A human brain simply can't keep up.</i><p>What would be the point of that? A Magic iPhone Box, one that coughed out new designs so quickly that humans couldn't keep up, would be throttled back. What's the point of filling up warehouse after warehouse with beautiful new iPhones -- each unique and special -- that we don't even have time to try out? It's a waste of material resources. Why even bother building the Magic Box in the first place? Or should we build another Box that can appreciate the iPhones for us, faster than the eye can see? Who's going to pay the fuel bill for all that?<p>In manufacturing theory there's a concept of balancing the line: the slowest step in the manufacturing process serves as the bottleneck, and the secret to maximizing efficiency is to let that bottleneck control the speed of everything else. It doesn't pay to produce a million nuts and bolts per hour if you're only using ten thousand per hour: You just pile up expensive excess inventory -- and if the inventory rusts, or the designers eliminate nuts and bolts in the next version of your product, you <i>lose</i> all that inventory.<p>Similarly, the pace of technological change is ultimately constrained by human timescales. We're the technologists. We're the ones who control the knobs. We now have machines that can play master-level chess faster than the eye can follow, but we don't let them do that -- we don't let them run day and night, filling up our hard drives with recordings of dazzling strategic moves that we'll never have time to see. Instead, we turn the machines down to our speed, and use the leftover processing cycles for something else. Or turn them off and save some precious energy.<p>If you've lost the distinction between the <i>Terminator</i> films and real life, or have watched too many episodes of <i>Pinky and the Brain</i>, you might believe that a smart machine could somehow <i>take control</i> of the knobs from the humans. But, really, it's hard to sneak up on seven billion people, no matter how smart a toaster you are. Particularly when those people control your supply chain.",1213133765

Sure, ""cunt"" and ""vagina"" aren't at all the same word, but I wouldn't say that if my web developers co-workers used the word ""vagina"" constantly that would be just fine.<p>As we're living in a reality where, you know, rape and suchlike happens fairly frequently, if I were a woman in a mostly male workplace and the word vagina was constantly bandied about, is it wrong that I'd feel uncomfortable?<p>Or say I was a middle-school math teacher who wrote all of his word problems in the form ""so, one vagina is moving at 12 miles per hour due east, and..."".<p>Talk is a step towards action, and it <i>does</i> matter what people say, as we are led to imagine them carrying out related actions, and we often assume (rightly or wrongly) some level of intent behind speech.<p>Maybe that's part of the reason behind some of the taboo words?

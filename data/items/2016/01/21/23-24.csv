I for one cannot imagine being like the Clojure author, committing scratch-pad code into repo. At the same time, I despise the levels of complexity C++, Java and C# have introduced. Ruby and Javascript (and sometimes Python, Bash) are my goto. However, I like to organize things, keep them DRY. A project like Rails is extremely well architected for an interpreted language based on the authors observations. I highly doubt that it is an outlier.",1453420791

But honestly, a wealth tax is just demotivating. Not every wealthy person invests their new found riches. It makes sense only to tax gains from investments, but only gains. Not making money on your capital? No problem, you don&#x27;t pay. If you are,  you do pay extra tax. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s a bad idea to group income and capital gains together, as long as you can offset losses from capital against taxes on income.<p>Second point against a pure wealth tax: some of that wealth might be tied up in very illiquid assets (say, a castle worth €20m), meaning you might not be able to keep them because you have to pay the annual wealth tax. Or in say, art, which can be highly volatile in its valuation. This will automatically lead to disputes with tax authorities about valuations, etc etc. Not exactly fun to deal with + it&#x27;s hard to enforce/verify",1453420549

(The fact that you&#x27;re talking about generating content with org-mode and pandoc is kind of a big hint here, honestly.) Our requirements for hosting can be a little more demanding than the target audience WordPress aims at.<p>But you know, I&#x27;m running WordPress for one of my sites now, and at least in my experience, the &quot;constant security updates&quot; are about as much of a nightmare as they are for iPhone applications at this point. It updates itself! Every so often I log into the admin panel and make sure the plugins I&#x27;m using are updated, too -- which is generally a few clicks. From a user standpoint, rather than a nerdy hacker standpoint, WP is frankly closer to a maintenance-free, turnkey CMS than I really thought possible. The majority of WP users <i>never</i> need to hack their theme and post code, and I&#x27;d say of the ones who do, the vast majority need to do it very, very rarely.<p>I get that when you <i>do</i> look at it from a nerdy hacker standpoint, WP can be mildly to profoundly annoying. I <i>am</i> writing a new theme for my site to do a few specific things and I&#x27;m finding it kind of infuriating work. But as far as full-featured, self-hostable tools go, WP is just about impossible to beat. (And on many hosts the installation is pretty close to one-click; even if you have to do it manually, there are fewer steps with WP than with almost any other major web software package out there. Anyone wondering how PHP can possibly be still so popular when its fractal wrongness is so well documented just has to look at how easy installing WP is compared to installing roughly any other non-PHP web app ever written.)<p>At any rate, the web isn&#x27;t intrinsically any more difficult than it ever was: if you want to build a static web site, you still can, and you don&#x27;t need any tools in 2016 that you wouldn&#x27;t have had in 1996. The reason that hosted publishing solutions are so popular goes back to the difference between &quot;nerd&quot; and &quot;non-nerd,&quot; I suspect: whatever else one can say about Medium, getting an article published through it and having it look good by modern design standards is <i>really, really easy.</i> I&#x27;d like to see more self-hosting blogging myself, but &quot;just write your articles in your favorite plain text editor in Markdown, process them with Jekyll and push &#x27;em up to your server of choice with rsync&quot; is, for most of humanity, simply not an attractive alternative to &quot;type into this WYSIWYG box and click Publish.&quot;",1453419923

There are multiple approaches that attempt to solve the same problem (PCLs versus shared libraries; both have their place but they overlap uncomfortably) and cross-platform development is an abject disaster (CoreCLR may eventually get to a good place but I wouldn&#x27;t use Mono in production for long-running services). NuGet--itself a problem in many ways, it&#x27;s very poor the second you get off the happy path--exists but in my experience its usage is spotty, whereas even the jankiest Ant projects I&#x27;ve ever worked with at least used Ivy. Libraries in NuGet are also, I think, a lot more hit-or-miss than I&#x27;m used to either in Ruby or on the JVM. Some stuff is real good (JSON.NET!). Some stuff is real, real bad (the bajillion competing and differently defective YAML tools), and there isn&#x27;t the same sort of cultural focus on pushing the good to the forefront.<p>This isn&#x27;t a strong defense of Java, because I think the JVM and its ecosystem isn&#x27;t super great either.

But, then, handing someone a couple million dollars in the <i>hope</i> that it will turn into 50 or 100 million is an irrational act, too.  So, it&#x27;s hard to get too upset over them being <i>purely</i> irrational.<p>There are two problems:<p>1) VCs/Investors are sheep.<p>This is the infuriating one as it makes most of the VCs/investors you deal with effectively useless.  To the point that when pitching to them the goal is to <i>trigger</i> that behavior (the term is FOMO-&quot;Fear of Missing Out&quot; aka: acting like sheep).  So, if everybody is investing in something, everybody will invest in something.  Until it blows apart.

Concurrency happens just fine in MRI in many cases because the blocker is the global interpreter lock; if you&#x27;re doing I/O, threads operate concurrently in MRI.

10949277,comment,10947712,10949065,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"That gets into some pretty profound discussions of just what &quot;risk&quot; is.<p>The current benchmark (e.g., used in the IPCC&#x27;s own assessments of carbon-neutral energy options) is of lives per GW generation. I find this naive on numerous counts, e.g., my citation of the Banqiao disaster -- horrible if you were caught up in it (though also note: the bulk of the deaths werev from disease and starvation in the aftermath, the acute toll from the inundation was ~40-50k).<p>Virtually all deaths due to conventional processes -- physical, heat, trauma, even chemical -- are <i>fairly</i> ameliorable by direct precautions.  Even in the case of a massive dam failure -- Banqiao, Johnstown, Vajont -- advance warning of a few minutes would have reduced fatalities tremendously, and with hours or days, all but entirely.  Each of these disasters was precipitated by clear warning signs, though they were unheeded, for various reasons. In the Johnstown and Vajont cases, state of the art in engineering and geology was a major component.  Perverse incentives to plant operators existed in <i>all</i> cases.<p>Looking at instances of explosions also suggests that warning, evacuation, and shelter could save virtually all lives, assuming a proper understanding of circumstances.  Halifax, Canada, Galveston, TX, West, TX, Martinez, CA, Tianjin, China, and Lac Megantic, Canada all represented substantial loss of life which could have been avoided through both better advanced risk management and notice in advance of the precipitating disasters.  Contrast the Pepcon disaster, among the largest non-nuclear blasts ever. Immediate deaths, though, were only two (another 370 or so injured), in large part due to the facility&#x27;s isolation from any surrounding structures.<p>By contrast, long-term chronic exposures can be quite debilitating. Minimata, Japan, Love Canal, Hinkley, CA (&quot;Erin Brokovich&quot;), Bhopol, India, Agent Orange throughout Vietnam and SE Asia, and industrial contamination throughout China, will likely be with us for a long, long time. Flint, MI, can be added to that list.<p>Chemicals can generally be mitigated through binding and sequestration operations, nucleotides are more difficult. Long-term low-level chronic emissions, or perhaps worse: punctuated equilibria, concern me.<p>The bigger concern I have though is for <i>systemic</i> failure. Nuclear energy provisioning, particularly based on very sparse fuel sources (uranium from seawater, thorium from rare earths mining) creates a long-term dependence on a large and potentially fragile technological stack. By contrast, wind, solar, and hydroelectric power are rather simpler, and even geothermal is <i>fairly</i> straightforward.<p>&quot;Complexity is the enemy of reliability&quot; is a phrase first occurring in <i>The Economist</i> newspaper, January 18, 1958. It&#x27;s been repeated, usually as &quot;complexity is the enemy&quot;, many times since, though I suspect those citing it don&#x27;t know the origins (my first encounter was through Eric S. Raymond&#x27;s writings).<p>Creating a civilisation-supporting technological stack that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> complex seems a strong goal.  And quantifying <i>systemic global risk</i> part of the problem.<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=aDsiAQAAMAAJ&q=%22complexity+is+the+enemy%22&dq=%22complexity+is+the+enemy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_tZgU9ncAYGQyATBp4GYDg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=aDsiAQAAMAAJ&q=%22complexit...</a><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/24cxgc/programming_sucks_or_a_young_ladys_illustrated/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/24cxgc/program...</a>",1453417728

In the big picture, what does increasing demand really do for us?<p>But there&#x27;s definitely a need to reduce poverty. And there&#x27;s a need to allow ourselves to stop working as hard as we do. A basic minimum income would help accomplish these things. Where do we get the money from? It doesn&#x27;t really matter, there&#x27;s plenty of it sloshing around.

It surprised the people who created the life insurance industry in Japan, who basically all went broke because they guaranteed to pay a 3% interest rate. I think everybody’s been surprised by it, including all the people who are in the economics profession who kind of pretend they knew it all along. But I think practically everybody was flabbergasted. I was flabbergasted when they went low; when they went negative in Europe – I’m really flabbergasted. How many in this room would have predicted negative interest rates in Europe? Raise your hands. [No hands go up]. That’s exactly the way I feel. How can I be an expert in something I never even thought about that seems so unlikely. It’s new territory….<p>I think something so strange and so important is likely to have consequences. I think it’s highly likely that the people who confidently think they know the consequences – none of whom predicted this – now they know what’s going to happen next? Again, the witch doctors. You ask me what’s going to happen? Hell, I don’t know what’s going to happen. I regard it all as very weird. If interest rates go to zero and all the governments in the world print money like crazy and prices go down – of course I’m confused.

9877494,comment,9877189,9877189,0,0,atmosx,,,"Greetings from Greece,<p>You have to understand that Greece is a very young country between that west and the east that was never modernized to the core. Renaissance came in Europe when Greece was ruled by the Ottoman empire. Indeed the cultural impact of the Ottoman empire\nis extremely strong here, although many people don’t realize it. The moment a government different from PASOK and ND came to power, was a pivotal moment in Greece’s “democratic” history (1974 and on). The population was ready for a change and tried to\nremove from the government everything the two other parties resembled: corruption, clientellism and injustice. A lack of a justice estate is the biggest problem in Greece. There’s not even the hint of justice.<p>I voted for SYRIZA and I strongly supported the government until last Monday. After Varoufakis resignation I knew what to expect but did not wanted to believe that it was going to actually happen. Well it did in a spectacular way and I can’t stress how disappointed I feel.\nNo matter what Varoufakis says, SYRIZA lost the most important battle the first two months and that battle was with the local oligarchy. I will give you some prominent example of failure where it matters the most:<p>- Rena Dourou, the SYRIZA MP who turned Mayor of Athens right before SYRIZA came to power, signed a contract with SIEMENS[1]. As far as I’m concerned, she was bribed, exactly the same way PASOK and ND were bribed in the past by SIEMENS.<p>- Deputy Minister of Finance Nadia Valavani, announces that ship-owners won’t be taxes because if they do, they will change flag(!). That’s a spectacular U-Turn from a “left” government. Of course the statement did not hit the headlines in Greece because we occupy the  99th position at the Freedom press index.<p>- The first thing Minister Lafazanis did were raise the salary of our national power company called “DEI”. These guys (workers) get paid ~ 1.250 EUR, which is an extremely high salary for public workers. There are DOZENS of underpaid public servants. Hospitals are running out of syringes and cotton and this guy has the nerve to give a raise to an already highly paid group of people!!! The nerve!!!<p>- All main private TV stations and newspapers in Greece operate with heavy losses. They are subsidized by the state and owned by the oligarchs who effectively keep in the check the government by controlling the (mis)information. Not one of them was taxed in since January. This is something that should had been done in the first week of governance. Right away.<p>SYRIZA tried to compromise and turn into a new corrupted PASOK with everyone, but apparently everyone kept spitting them in the face: The local oligarchy and the Troika at the same time. But IMHO their major failure was the lack of will to tackle our local oligarchy and bring at least a glimpse of justice and equality to our country. And you can blame Germany all you want abroad, but there’s seriously no excuse for not taking action at home. NONE.<p>As far as the EU/ECB/IMF is concerned. Well, here Varoufakis is at fault: They SHOULD have prepare a Grexit, as smooth as possible, but they should be ready for a Grexit. They didn’t (both Varoufakis and Tsipras) even ALLOW the public conversation to dig on the topic! It was dismissed as soon as someone hinted the idea. That’s incredibly stupid from someone who is (because I believe he really is) as smart as Varoufakis.<p>The result is ridiculous, if not plainly tragic: We actually gave away sovereignty after holding a referendum. Tsipras probably expected the ‘YES’ vote to win by a large margin getting him effectively off the hook, but that did not happen and he found himself trapped because it’s crystal clear that at any cost he does not want to manage a GREXIT but he is totally unfit to manage a third ‘memoradum’ which involves selling national assets to the best offerer.<p>SYRIZA IMHO is politically dead. The entire Greek parliament is totally out of sync with the Greek society. I’m extremely concerned about what the future will bring for my country. If Golden Dawn’s percentages grow, I’ll have to leave the country because I can’t stand those people, but Greece today resemble very much pre-WW-2 Germany and the TROIKA resembles very much the winners of the first WW.<p>If you take anything from this long post is this: The Greeks, especially the young population, are ready to take any change that will made their life easier in the long term. But the troika has showed time and again that doesn’t care about the population. They need a country to blame, do business with our oligarchs, recycle money through our banks and that’s about it. The local oligarchs are even worse, so we’re caught between the hammer and the anvil and I see no way through.<p>I don’t know what to vote when the time comes, I don’t even know if I wanna keep following politics at home since everything seems so desperate. Oh, my prediction is that Germany’s obsessions are going to end the european project pretty soon. IMHO they already alienated far too many europeans and created a schism in Europe’s population. Now the European governments are all singing like a chorus but these governments in Portugal, Italy, Spain, Ireland, UK will IMHO soon be brought down.<p>Sorry for the long-long comment, farewell everyone!<p>[1] <a href=""http://ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_09/03/2015_548022"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_09/03/201...</a>",1436788258

That doesn&#x27;t mean the government action is illegitimate or undemocratic.<p>> Greece faces [utter destruction] solely due to Greek overspending and irresponsibility<p>Not true.

Tax collections in Greece are at a little over 10% what&#x27;s owed compared to 97.5% in Germany, deficit spending is astronomical, they have hardly any exports except for tomatoes and olives, have been using cheap credit to splurge for over a decade with no means of repaying their debts, and the so-called austerity was a farce in that it failed to achieve any significant improvement in their financial situation, or the goals they were meant to reach.<p>Greece was ranked the most corrupt nation in the EU. Greece has a thriving black economy which is unofficially at around 35% of the total economy. On top of that, Greece was understating their deficit figures for years. Their national debt stands at €340 billion today, give or take a few billion.<p>Interest rates for Greece hovered at around 18% before they had the Euro, and not many were willing to lend to them. Later, cheap abundant credit helped them increase state spending on pensions, jobs, and benefits, all with borrowed money, while barely being able to manage to pay the interest on their debts; this brought them great political mileage at the time.<p>Now that the payments are due, €45 billion has left Greece in Q1 of this year. On June 15 alone, banks saw cash outflows of €400 million - yes, that&#x27;s in one day. Youth unemployment is at 50% and nearly a quarter of a million people have left Greece for good over the past five years.<p>Now most of the country is up for sale, right down to their public infrastructure, ports, and so on, with very few buyers.<p>Austerity amounts to little when the rot is systemic at this scale. Greece should have never been in the EU in the first place, and they would have retained the Drachma if they were truly interested in sustainable long term stability.<p>I feel for the Greek people, but a cheap bailout is absolutely not the solution to this problem today.<p>Greece was &quot;set up&quot;?

What Germany offered was help under the condition that Greece stops killing itself.<p>Related: Why didn’t Greece implement some reforms already? Everywhere it seems to be a common understanding that reforms are only going to be implemented in return for more money. However, it is fairly obvious that it is in the country’s best interest to e.g. tackle its tax-collection problem regardless of whether or not new euros arrive.

I think that is hindsight bias to relate the website&#x27;s 2008 designs to cause&effect of VC decisions.<p>The April 2015 website designs looks &quot;prettier&quot; but as far as <i>communicating</i> to unknowing customers (and uninformed VCs) what Airbnb <i>actually does</i>, the &quot;uglier&quot; 2008 designs are actually <i>better</i>.<p>Notice that the 2008 designs have icons/pictures of an actual <i>&quot;bed&quot;</i> and a <i>&quot;breakfast&quot;</i>.  It&#x27;s <i>concrete</i> visual communication. But the 2015 photos instead, show &quot;people&quot; in what I call &quot;aspirational lifestyle&quot; poses.  It&#x27;s <i>abstract</i> visual communication.  (And I just took another quick look at airbnb.com today July 13 2015 and now the home page shows photos of &quot;destinations&quot; overlayed with city names in prominent white font.  So now the page design taps into the romanticisms of the Condé Nast Traveler.  The visual abstractions continue.)<p>I think it&#x27;s fascinating the lifecycle of companies&#x27;s visual style that transition from The Concrete --> The Abstract.  The visuals including marketing, advertisements, and home webpage designs.<p>The concrete approach has to show the actual product.  The abstract does not.<p>At this point, I think Airbnb can get away with abstract visuals because they are well-known enough now to not have to waste landing page pixels on an actual &quot;bed&quot; or &quot;eggs & toast&quot;.  That&#x27;s what 7 years of penetrating the public consciousness allows you to do.  These days, I would guess that the <i>majority</i> of visitors already know (by way of friends & family) what Airbnb does  <i>before</i> they visit airbnb.com.<p>Therefore, if the company is a startup nobody knows, they must use concrete visuals.  If a company is established and successful, they have the luxury of being abstract.  I don&#x27;t think tomorrow&#x27;s YC2016 unknown company should base their website&#x27;s information design based on airbnb&#x27;s 2015 website.  Instead, look at their 2008 designs even though they are uglier.<p>Other examples of companies doing abstract visuals:<p>Nike&#x27;s &quot;Just Do It&quot; commercials often <i>do not</i> highlight any shoes in obvious ways and instead show sweaty people running or playing.[1]  (If one didn&#x27;t know Nike was a shoe and sports apparel company, one might think that commercial was about karate lessons.)<p>Viagra commercial don&#x27;t show the actual pills but instead shows older couples holding hands walking the beach or a guy sailing a boat.[2]  This is unlike many Tylenol pills commercials showing the actual pills.[3]<p>Even in the tech world has examples.  Anyone remember the old IBM OS/2 Warp commercials in 1990s?  The entire commercial was showing people&#x27;s faces looking at a computer screen (presumably of OS/2).  The camera didn&#x27;t show what they were looking at -- therefore you saw no GUI demostrations.  The camera also didn&#x27;t show the software box.  It was just a bunch of reaction shots of people&#x27;s faces showing astonishment (&quot;wow!&quot;, &quot;cool!&quot;, etc). [4]<p>The abstract commmercials from Nike & IBM are not suitable for convincing investors who don&#x27;t understand athletic shoes or operating system software.  Likewise, the 2015 versions of airbnb.com showing abstract lifestyle photos are not useful for potential investors either.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5dZZBKTXQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5dZZBKTXQ</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ZqQ55T25c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ZqQ55T25c</a><p>[3]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIYEC9mNqM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIYEC9mNqM</a><p>[4]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6YZbrhBhjQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6YZbrhBhjQ</a>",1436786837

The conclusion I reached is that it&#x27;s because technological limitations you get to see in graphics. Models are made from low-poly meshes, and you can (still) see the straight edges where you know they should be curved. Textures are too low-detail; stand next to a wall or close to any entity in a 3D game and you&#x27;ll always see the texture upscaling, lack of detail.<p>Most of 3D games try to go for &quot;realistic&quot; visuals, but they never cross the uncanny valley. 2D games seem to look prettier to me because they don&#x27;t set up expectations - so as long as they have consistent art style, the brain doesn&#x27;t complain much. Moreover, in 2D productions artists usually have full control of every pixel displayed on screen, so the art can be (and usually is) very detailed. The limits that 2D environment places are more strict than limits of available technology, so your experience doesn&#x27;t get ruined by jagged edges and texture upscaling.<p>That&#x27;s why I still like the original StarCraft more than StarCraft 2 and think that introducing 3D graphics was a bad decision - the original art style looked serious, dark, had an atmosphere. SC2&#x27;s style is dominated by clunky 3D models which look more like child&#x27;s toys than serious hardware. But then again maybe this was made on purpose - the plot of SC2 seems about as serious as the graphics, which is not at all.",1436785544

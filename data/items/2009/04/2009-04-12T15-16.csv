There are things that are true that are unprovable, and there are things that are proved that are not true. Science models reality as an abstraction -- and all abstractions are leaky. The power of belief is separate from the thing believed, and the propensity to clan and tell stories is not going to be wished or rationalized away.<p>Besides, there's always hope for next year, right?

- the tagging tool doesn't work well, tried Senior System Administrator, didn't find category, same for CTO
- I tried ""CTO at companyx, Montreal, Canada"" it showed ""text too short"" 
- you might wanna also weigh in the number of followers to rank the tweets. I think a twitter bot will have less interesting tweets (auto-generated tweets), while a company's official twitter account will have much more followers, with legitimate twitter jobs
- you should also have a navigation menu, or search function to find jobs by city or country<p>also I'm ok with using the hashtag rtjobs, but #jobs is more obvious no??",1239551539

558521,comment,558444,558444,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Couple of design/usability things I see:<p>- Using a stock font included with OSX (Marker Felt) for the logo would not have been my first choice. And, marker Felt reminds me of comic-sans.<p>- The logo is not matted properly, I can see a square box around it of a lighter shade of gray. Could be due to color shifts with your color profiles in Photoshop, or your original file is CMYK and is being converted to RGB when you save for web. The easy fix: change the CSS background-color of the header to #1b1c1e instead of #000.<p>- From a IA perspective, what's more important to the end-user: 1) the twitter user that submitted the job or 2) the job title and description? I believe it to be the latter, but the jobs titles are lost amongst the bright pink links used on submitters name and pagination (two items relatively unimportant, but those elements shout at me).<p>- The [1] next to each title is also confusing. Perhaps using Tooltips throughout the site would improve usability. I could also see that number being moved to the right of the Job Title.<p>- I can't decide how I feel about the Twitter avatars as I can almost immediately tell that the site seems to be more focused on aggregating aggregators â€“ at which point I tend to bounce onto other job sites that offer distinctively different jobs, than the same stuff I see over and over again.<p>- The rotating headline at the top is wasted space as it stands. That is prime real-estate that's not being utilized effectively. I would switch it to a leaderboard banner that you can rotate JobMigo announcements through until you have paying advertisers.",1239550661

Most highway construction happens just to serve rush hour traffic, a time when mass transit is at its most efficient.<p>If these subsidies did not exist, mass transit would be much more widely used.

Is that book the source of every claim you made? That's not even remotely clear to me from reading your post. Most of your claims are all extremely vague and you don't connect them to the book at all, so they sound like you just spouting your opinions.<p><i>Where is your evidence? Where is your research? Where is your support?</i><p>I don't need any evidence, research, or support, because I didn't make any claims. <i>You</i> made some extraordinary claims, so <i>you</i> need to provide the support.<p><i>I'm a highly educated expert on this subject</i><p>If you're a ""highly educated expert on this subject"", I'd expect a little more actual data. For example, you could say something like ""37% of those who worked their way to wealth are sociopaths"" instead of ""Sociopaths are found in large proportions among those who worked their way to wealth"". If you're an expert you should probably at least roughly know that number, and without out, I don't know what ""large proportion"" means. Does that mean 40%? Or does it mean 1% and that's a large proportion because that's 20x the rate that sociopaths are found in society at large?<p><i>exemplary sources that are entirely based on hard science</i><p>Sorry, but none of this is based on ""hard science"", because psychology isn't a hard science. There's not even an accepted definition and difference for sociopath vs. psychopath and neither is a diagnosis in the DSM, which is part of why your post was confusing. Though some psychologists use the term differently, sociopaths are generally considered to be more fringe and abnormal, whereas psychopaths are more likely to appear charming and successful on the outside. Which seems like it would apply to most of your claims far more than the term sociopath. But perhaps Ms. Stout uses the term interchangeably.<p><i>...I'm just about done with this anti-intellectual community...</i><p><i>...little know-nothing blogger peons like you...</i><p>You might find a more receptive audience in this community for your extraordinary and unsupported claims if you took the time to give actual statistics, cited your sources, and refrained from name-calling.

As a Hollywood refugee myself, I'm intrigued. And here we are now, brainstorming alternatives. It's exciting. I would argue, however, that the past might offer us glimpse into the future.<p>Those unfamiliar with the history of United Artists -- a studio founded by leading talent, looking to declare independence from the Hollywood of their day -- might find the story of its rise and fall intriguing, if not a bit bittersweet. It's the story of a house ultimately divided, then fallen.<p>Today, a smaller-scale analogue (of a sort) exists in Maker Studios, an LA-based collective of viral YouTube artists collaborating and co-producing each other's work.

Rather, it is an issue of demographics: almost everybody is affected or at least mildly interested in politics; only smaller subsets of the population are interested in Haskell/Erlang/complexity/aglorithms...etc. Frankly, I bet some people are as ""passionate"" (for a loose definition of ""passionate"") about, say, functional programming as others are about politics; there are just more people with at least a casual interest in the latter than the former.<p>Also, as HN gets more readers, it becomes more diverse.

In the decision tree model of computation (where decision nodes have constant degree), consider the problem of finding the value corresponding to a key in a dictionary with n elements. Each leaf is labeled by a value, and in the general case where all values are distinct there are n leaves. So, the tree must have at least one path of length Omega(log n). Note that this is true even when the key space is a contiguous interval like [0..n], where it's just an array indexing problem. That's why the RAM model of computation is strictly more powerful than the decision tree model.<p>> log(n!) ~ n * log (n)<p>Random aside: while this is usually proven with Stirling's approximation, there is a much simpler proof. For the upper bound, n! <= n^n because 1 <= n, ..., n <= n. For the lower bound, n! >= (n/2)^(n/2) because you can drop the first n/2 terms without increasing the product and estimate the last n/2 terms as being >= n/2. That gives the double inequality (n/2)^(n/2) <= n! <= n^n. Take logs and you get (n/2) log(n/2) <= log(n!) <= n log(n). What makes this proof tick is that while (n/2)^(n/2) is a really shitty lower bound on n!, the shittiness evaporates once you take logs.",1327279197

Eventually everybody will have grown up playing video games.<p>But the real competitor in my mind is television.  With reduced costs for special effects, television has pretty much all the same tools as movies.

Then after you spend a few million dollar making a movie, you'll find it a bit risky to try a new unproven distribution model.<p>It's naive to say that today anyone can make a movie, because cameras are cheaper. The average guy is still far from being able to produce anything remotely near a Hollywood production level. If that was true, if anyone (or any reasonably sized studio) could make a near Hollywood level movie. Then the competition would have killed them already. But that's a point where technology is specially important in fixing. The tools are still not cheap enough, but are getting cheaper. We can make them better.<p>Distribution is already here.

Learn to love recursion trees. It addresses both issues. It's intuitive and it's general. As a side effect, the master theorem becomes an almost obvious fact; the three different cases correspond to geometric sums with increasing, decreasing and constant terms, with the caveat that since we are working asymptotically, increasing/decreasing/constant must be interpreted in the looser asymptotic sense. A geometric series with increasing (decreasing) terms is dominated by its last (first) term, corresponding in the recursion to the last (first) level of the tree. That makes it trivial to estimate the sum: just estimate the cost at the appropriate level and you're done.

I've seen it in the community I managed as well.<p>First you have the founder(s) of the community and the early adopters. These people all are like minded, and all appreciate the mission or goal of the community. They contribute great things which makes it an awesome place to hang out all the time.<p>The next group of people who come in hear about how cool this small community is. They for the most part have the right idea but sometimes they are too enthusiastic and want to contribute right away instead of building cred slowly. This causes them to do things that doesn't quite fit with the original intent of the community. This annoys some early members and they leave.<p>The next wave are people the enthusiastic 2nd wave people bring in through evangelizing the community. Unfortunately the 2nd wave choose to highlight not the mission of the community but the benefits of it. This 3rd wave group are often in it for self gain and promotion rather than to be contributing members of the community. The original mission of the founder(s) is lost in the shuffle as the number of people who ""get it"" are quickly being outnumbered by those who are new and ""don't get it"". More of the early community members, people who made the original community so great, leave leaving the 2nd generation as the elder members. The remaining original members get into confrontational debates about what the community is supposed to be with the newer members.<p>After that, the community continues to degrade, eventually most of the original community resort to just lurking instead of engaging with the community which is now pretty much filled with self promotion and self serving. The community from the outside looking in appears to be the same on the surface but is a shell of its former greatness and actually quite sad for the original members and the founder(s).<p>The sad thing is there are people who come in the new waves that do get it, and have appreciation for the original mission and purpose of the founder, but they are always outnumbered by the others.",1327277969

3498400,comment,3497603,3497862,13,0,jonnathanson,,,"For the legitimately curious, I'd recommend starting with anyone from the ancient Greeks to Chekhov. For more basic, and perhaps more practical guidelines, I'd recommend anything by Syd Field, William Goldman, Robert McKee, or J. Michael Straczynski. Those are sort of the time-honored classics in the how-to genre of screenwriting and story structure.<p>A few tidbits, and by no means comprehensive:<p>- Typical screenplays weigh in at around 90 to 120 pages, and most of the time, execs prefer a screenplay to hover around the southern end of that spectrum.<p>- A screenplay usually follows a three-act structure. If we take a 90-page (roughly 90-minute) screenplay as a template, then the first act is the first 30 pages. The second act occurs from roughly pages 30 to 60, and the third act roughly from pages 60 to 90. Typically, there's a key turning point or reversal halfway between each of those acts, too.<p>- The stakes get higher as the story progresses. The protagonist makes a crucial decision around page 30 which sets him off on his adventure. Shit hits the fan between 30 and 60, at which point, the protagonist realizes what he must do to resolve the situation. But then shit gets even worse, and the hero's in serious peril (physically, emotionally, or what have you). The final ~30 pages represent his final push against the antagonist(s), with a climax occurring around page 75 to 80, and a denuement from 80 to 90.<p>- Each scene must move the story forward in some meaningful way. This doesn't have to be overt or action-based; even a dialogue between two characters should create and then resolve something. This can be very subtle, and it's hard to notice in films. But the difference between a scene that moves, and a scene that drags or is pointless, can become readily apparent when reading a screenplay.<p>- Subtext: characters have personalities, goals, motivations, agendas, desires, and intentions. They don't overtly state these goals or intentions in dialogue. Two hallmarks of bad dialogue are 1) expository dialogue, i.e., dialogue that serves little purpose but to explain things; and 2) dialogue in which characters broadcast their intentions. Characters speak in their own voices. In bad dialogue, all the characters sound the exact same. In good dialogue, the characters have different ways of speaking, seeing things, etc.<p>- Good plots involve interesting characters that make interesting choices. The plot stems from the actions, or reactions, of a character to his circumstances. Things don't just ""happen"" to the character. He makes choices, and what happens next is a consequence of those choices.<p>- As a corollary to the above: interesting things happen when good characters make bad decisions. Think of Frodo and the ring of power. It would have been a pretty boring book (and movie) if he'd just kept the damned thing in his pouch the whole time and never put it on, right? In fact, I'd recommend Peter Jackson's first of the three LOTR movies to anyone wanting a crash course in screen plotting. It's a long movie, and it does slow down from time to time, but it's amazingly structured. Nearly every scene flows logically from the next, and in a subtle way. Every scene is the result of someone's decision, and the tension escalates accordingly.<p>- The Golden Rule: <i>show</i>, don't <i>tell</i>. Don't use expository dialogue as a substitute for action (and, by ""action,"" I mean characters making interesting choices and doing interesting things. ""Action"" does not necessarily mean fight scenes or car chases). Don't use narration if you can avoid it. Narration is lazy. Sometimes people have broken the narration rule to great effect (i.e., when you have an unreliable narrator, or a narrator who provides humorous color commentary) -- but 9 times out of 10, narration could have been better substituted by story.",1327277898

(I remember deleting a comment I made on an old account merely because, without tone, it seemed inflammatory; I felt compelled to delete it even though it had no malicious intent because it damaged the conversation.)<p>Now, I think it has become too large and feels anonymous. Posting something offensive has no cost because it doesn't feel like a ""know your neighbor""-type community anymore. The costs imposed by karma seem to be less significant.

You'd be hard-pressed to find one of those.<p>I know this isn't what a lot of HNers like to hear, but discrimination exists whether you can measure it with a ruler or not. This is one of those things where you have to piece together anecdotal evidence with an empirical lack of women to get the answer.",1327277036
3498360,comment,3496943,3497452,5,0,kd1221,,,"It's not about gender.  From your point of view it's about character weakness.  A woman has bad experiences with men, so she should be trained to seek haven among women?  If she wants to get a mortgage, should she do so only through a female mortgage broker?  If she wants to buy a car, does it have to be sold to her by a woman?  Or more generally does she need to attend a women-only class that teaches her to negotiate with salesmen? Sounds like a form of community codependency to me.<p>A better solution might be to teach women (and men) to accept and understand different styles of communication.  And that class shouldn't be gender-specific.<p>In regard to programming, another commenter had a great solution.  Get some books, make a github account, learn to code.  You have complete anonymity on github.  It's a place where all aspects of your individuality can drop out of consideration except the most important in the context: your ability to understand and write code.",1327277011

For example, a company based in Gurgaon pays fairly little in taxes. On the other hand, they need to provide their own roads, water and police services. (This is partly why Gurgaon is thriving - corporations seem to do a much better job of this than the Indian government.)<p>You might be right that some nations provide a better benefit/tax ratio. But the solution is not for the US to tax their corporations, the solution is for the US to provide more cost effective government services.<p>I agree that we should equalize taxes across income sources. My simple proposal? We should eliminate all corporate income taxes, dividend taxes, cap gains, etc, and put all income into the same bucket. But this is unpopular since it makes it more difficult to raise taxes - individuals immediately see higher taxes and blame politicians, rather than merely seeing their jobs go overseas and blame investors, or seeing prices rise and blaming walmart.",1327276870

People lie, and men probably lie about their salaries more than women,<p>2. Willingness to divulge salary is highly culture-dependent, and in societies where salary is seen as a sign of social success, can be highly salary-dependent (and probably more so for men than for women).<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more I suggest looking for information about how national census data is processed; they have lots of experience dealing with these sorts of issues (albeit with different factors influencing response rates and data reliability).",1437242306

The design should match the user&#x27;s experience, expectations, and mental models.&quot; (Wikipedia). A system involving people is not efficient if the people are often surprised by its design, implementation, or behavior.<p>Efficient software solutions also tend to involve elegance. Take Git for example as an improvement over other source control systems. The conceptual primitives that Git is built upon are elegant and recognizing them as the correct basis for source control (along with a strong implementation) resulted in Git&#x27;s efficiency and power.<p>Granted, software is different from mathematics, but I find the parallel interesting. I suspect that a mathematician&#x27;s desire to find an elegant formulation, and appreciation of it, is very similar to the software engineer&#x27;s.",1437242232

Which is the USA. I&#x27;m not even sure whether this can still be said about Google or Facebook, given their Irish/Dutch tax haven constructions (I&#x27;m unaware if Reddit and Twitter do this too).<p>But then you have to claim the USA legally has the most free-est speech in the world, the superset of all things considered freedom of speech globally (admittedly, the US has less restrictions on free speech than the Netherlands, where I live), which I don&#x27;t think is the case actually (though the US&#x27; few particular restrictions are quite sensible IMO).<p>I&#x27;m quite happy with the fact that we don&#x27;t (really) have a global encompassing legal framework to define what is and what is not free speech. Even if that means some (nation) states will get it &quot;wrong&quot;, it provides us with perspective, hopefully both with examples to avoid, and others to look up to.<p>This makes Freedom of Speech, in the context where it does not pertain to legality within a particular (nation) state, but in the context of transnational businesses like Reddit/FB/G/Twitter/etc, more an ethical consideration rather than a legal one.<p>And I prefer it that way, laws are just The Rules, you need to follow to (say) operate a business (hopefully the Rules work for the greater good of that particular society). But Ethics is the stuff that makes your decisions Right or Wrong.<p>And that is what I&#x27;m going to judge a company by, if they operate where I live, but are bound by legal rules from elsewhere.",1437241912

9908131,comment,9906107,9908000,0,0,jeffmould,,,"It is confusing, so I will try to break it down as simple as possible at least the way I understood/understand it. The reason the reverse split happened in the first place was that the company was trying to get a certain valuation with a certain opening price for the stock at IPO. With the number of shares they had granted in the option pool, hitting those target numbers was impossible. To adjust for this, it was decided to do a reverse split to reduce the number of shares out thus allowing them meet their valuation and opening price for the IPO. For example, if they wanted raise $8,000,000 on the IPO and have a $20 opening price they could only have 400,000 shares out. Instead they had 32,000,000 shares out. This would have meant to hit the same $8,000,000 raise, they would have had to open at $0.25. So to adjust they did the 1 for 8 reverse split meaning they went from the 32,000,000 shares to 400,000 shares out. Now they can open at $20 and raise their $8,000,000.<p>Using the same example above, here is where it hits the employee. Let&#x27;s say on opening day the company opens at $20. Now let&#x27;s say in the original picture you owned 8000 shares and stock closed that day at $60. You would stand to have made approximately $320,000 ($480,000 - $160,000). However, now with the reverse split you now only have 1000 shares. The stock still opens at $20 and still closes at $60. But now you only made $40,000 ($60,000 - $20,000). That&#x27;s the downfall of a reverse split.<p>At least with a normal split (i.e. 2 for 1) you have an upside potential on earnings. This is how a lot of early employees of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Under Armour, etc... have made out significantly well for themselves. With a reverse split they are taking away shares so there is no upside.",1437239708

for what I&#x27;m doing, it&#x27;s enough,
and I don&#x27;t see anything else
clearly better.
My computer usage and software
development are on Windows.<p>My development is for a Web
site where the site runs on
Windows.  My Web site sends to
users just very standard HTTP,
HTML, and CSS; so users
need only a Web browser up to
date as of, say, five, maybe
10, years ago.<p>Each of my
Web pages is just 800 pixels
wide, with large fonts and high
contrast, and should look good
on any device with a screen
with 800 pixels of width.
The Web pages have both vertical
and horizontal scroll bars

even fewer pixels of height.<p>Net, my users might be

products -- fine with me,
but I don&#x27;t have to be
using Linux or Apple products

I&#x27;ve never used any Apple products.
I&#x27;ve never used Linux or Unix.
Why?  My project just doesn&#x27;t need
Apple products.  Or Linux.<p>That experience with Unix, Linux,
or Apple is a prerequisite for
being an expert in computing,
which I am, is absurd.<p>Yes, maybe generally HN is 
strongly in favor
of Apple and Linux and, basically,
hates Microsoft.<p>I had to select a computing <i>platform</i>,
and the main two choices were
Linux, maybe on Apple products,
and Microsoft.  I selected Microsoft.<p>For the hardware, I got some
parts, motherboard, processor,
fans, disk drives, CD/DVD
burners, diskette drive
(still used a few times),
power supply,
case, monitor, keyboard,
lots of cables, lots of
little screws, etc.,
a B/W laser printer connected
via USB, gigabit Ethernet,
etc.  Wired a cable to drive
my old daisy wheel printer
(still really good 
for addressing envelopes)
via a 9-pin serial port.<p>That hardware has been fine.<p>I&#x27;ve stayed
with Microsoft; that&#x27;s not a bad
decision.<p>Linux and Apple?  So far I don&#x27;t
need them and, thus, don&#x27;t want
to allocate time, money, and effort
to use them.<p>Your implication that Linux and Apple
are standard prerequisites for HN 
is rude, insulting, and absurd.<p><i>Xcode</i> -- garbage if not defined.<p>And I shouldn&#x27;t need Google to read
HN.<p>Lesson:  Once again, over again,
one more time, time n + 1 for
a very large n, clearly, simply,
don&#x27;t do it; never do it;
give up on it;
having <i>in group</i> jargon,
essentially deliberately undefined, is
garbage behavior;
trying to <i>put off</i> people
outside the in group is 
very bad behavior for everyone;
IBM used to do that and it really
cost them; in group jargon

undefined acronyms are really bad

don&#x27;t excuse it;
don&#x27;t put up with it.<p>I&#x27;m not against Apple or Linux;
it&#x27;s just that, given that I do
work on Windows, 
I don&#x27;t need Apple or Linux
and, thus, get to save on
time, money, and energy that would
be needed to use them.  And, Objective-C?
Don&#x27;t need it.  Python?  Don&#x27;t need it.
PHP, Ruby, Rails, Django,
Scheme, Lisp, 
assembler, C, C++,
model-view-controller,
Java, JavaScript,
JQuery, node.js -- don&#x27;t need them
because they add little or
nothing to what I already have
on Windows.<p>E.g., Microsoft&#x27;s ASP.NET
writes a little JavaScript
for me, but so far I have
not written or even read
a single line of it.  Don&#x27;t need it.<p>Pop-ups, pull-downs, roll-overs?
Don&#x27;t like them; don&#x27;t need them;
don&#x27;t use them.  JavaScript for
asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX),
don&#x27;t need it or use it.<p>A point:  I&#x27;m not a <i>professional
programmer</i>.  It&#x27;s been a long time
since I wrote code for other people.<p>Now I&#x27;m an entrepreneur doing a startup.
For my startup, I write all the
code, and I&#x27;m writing that code on
Windows.  I&#x27;ve written some quite
significant code.<p>But it is important for me
to save my time, money, and effort
and, thus, try hard not to <i>buy</i>,
that is, invest time, money, and effort in,

How much hand-holding will I have to do and is that amount acceptable? Do they seem trustworthy or particularly experienced in something we need?&quot; This is partly personality, but mostly communication skills, attitude, and professionalism.<p>The third part is that interviews are a two way street. The candidate is there to interview you just as much as you are there to interview them! Part of your job as the interviewer is not only to assess their qualifications, but to convince them that accepting your potential offer is the best thing they could do. Always, always, always open up with an explanation of who you are and why you&#x27;re the one interviewing them, as well as how the interview process will work and what you expect from them. Always, always, always leave 10 minutes (or more!) at the end of the session to let them ask questions.<p>If I walk into your onsite interview, and all you want to do is discover whether I know how to curry or pass functions as arguments or the difference between .apply() and .call(), then you&#x27;re wasting both of our time. (Not that you don&#x27;t need to know those things -- but there are easier ways to determine those, and you could do that before I even walk in the door.)<p>Your time is valuable. Consider how much code you could write in an hour. That&#x27;s how much code didn&#x27;t get written because you wanted to ask me, in person, whether I know what &quot;this&quot; means or what closures are. You could have verified that before I even walked in the door.<p>Instead, you should use your time as an interviewer wisely by asking only questions you cannot verify before they show up. As a candidate, I don&#x27;t want to waste your time and I don&#x27;t want my time to be wasted. As an interviewer, I don&#x27;t want to interview candidates that are unqualified and therefore waste my time and the candidate&#x27;s time.",1437239519

So after crimping, the only way they hold together is with solder.<p>There are no applications where this is better. Every connector manufacturer I know recommends against doing it. You can get away with doing it if you support the soldered end against vibration, but you should do that anyway.<p>It&#x27;s really a training issue. People haven&#x27;t been taught better and there is a lot of bad advice floating around hobbyist forums. I have only been using good crimping tools for the last few years since I started making a product with a 50-conductor harness. Until I spent $200 on a crimping tool and took the time to research how to make good crimps (Molex has an excellent document), I never realized how they were supposed to look. Now most of my tools are used, purchased at auctions of dead companies, but I have $400 crimping tools I paid pennies on the dollar for. Even so, I normally farm out crimping to a company that does it with automated machinery, better and faster than I can do by hand.",1437239299

They&#x27;re a property of the structure of the code, not of specific language features. For example, in the Linux kernel, which is written in C, there&#x27;s an abstraction called a file descriptor that represents a stream of bytes that your program can read/write, whether it comes from a file on a disk, a serial port, a pipe, etc.<p>Interfaces also exist in all languages: they&#x27;re just a well-defined set of calls that one piece of code uses to communicate with another piece of code. For example, the C runtime library (or any library) has an interface (API), and callers of the library don&#x27;t need to know about the internal structure of the library to be able to call its services. (There&#x27;s a pretty good book called &quot;C Interfaces and Implementations&quot;[1] that talks about how to write reusable code in C.)<p>Classes are also possible to implement in C. A class is pretty much a data structure with a bunch of functions (the methods) that manipulate its data. In C, this can be represented by a structure and bunch of function pointers. The &quot;constructor&quot; function calls malloc() to create an instance of the class, sets its member variables from its parameters and returns a pointer to it. (Implementing inheritance is a bit tricky.)<p>To be able effectively split development tasks across a team, the same rules apply as in any other language: implement functionality behind well-defined APIs so that one part of the code can be used by another without having to know the details of how it works.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201498413"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201498413</a>",1437239073

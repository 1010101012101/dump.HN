You can easily and unintentionally screw yourself if you're collecting cash up front for a product which involves future costs.<p>The only system I have found to work is accrual combined with customer prepayment (to eliminate credit risk; or just be very good at receivables management, which not everyone is) and aggressive cashflow management.  The biggest problems with accrual go away if you don't have to worry about customer payment risk or accidentally running out of cash in the short term.<p>You can lie to yourself (and others) with numbers with either kind of accounting, but it's harder to accidentally kill yourself with a conservative system.",1291510786

1970658,story,,,8,8,corpceo,"The mistake WikiLeaks made",,"I'm the CEO of a US corporation. This is a throwaway account.<p>I admire Julian Assange greatly. As the CEO of a company that provides services to Bloggers, I have seen first hand the good that free speech does. I believe that freedom of the press and freedom of speech is perhaps the greatest contributor to the success of the experiment that is the United States and many other countries that allow transparency.<p>I grew up in South Africa during Apartheid and witnessed first hand the evil that an opaque government perpetrates. It seems power without accountability inevitably leads to great evil.<p>I wholeheartedly supported Wikileaks disclosure of the Iraq footage of the death of Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen. I support the disclosure of the entire trove of diplomatic cables, even though most of the cables are not items of public interest - the test that traditional news organizations apply in deciding whether to disclose sensitive material.<p>Recently Julian and his organization said that they would release internal material that would sink a major US bank. The implication is clear: Wikileaks target's are not limited to governments. Corporations are fair game too.<p>In making this decision, Wikileaks lost many of their remaining friends with power. I'm not advocating whether or not this was the morally correct decision to make, but I would like to point out that it was a strategic blunder.<p>Since then Amazon have booted Wikileaks off their servers days after allowing them on. Today Paypal suspended their account.<p>While these events are quite probably unrelated to Wikileaks targeting corporations, it's unlikely that the executives in these companies would go out of their way to help Wikileaks after the organization has made it clear that corporations are fair game.<p>I recently had the pleasure of debating the wikileaks situation with a friend who has spent his entire career in Aerospace protecting government secrets. We agreed to disagree on the level of transparency that is acceptable. But he asked me how I would react if my intellectual property was published by Wikileaks. At the time I said that I would target the individuals who stole the IP and would leave Wikileaks alone. When Julian Assange made the announcement that he's targeting US companies I suddenly found myself emotionally engaged in the argument and discovered that I felt differently. I felt that organizations like Wikileaks could threaten my family's livelihood and that of my employees.<p>I tend to err on the side of maximum transparency. But I think that by targeting corporations, wikileaks has lost a critical source of support in the important work they're doing.<p>I'd like to hear how startup CEO's and executives on HN feel about wikileaks from a business perspective.<p>~torq",1291510691

I have been discussing this with someone recently how salaried work combined with large debts (mortgages, health care bills, student loans) and health insurance tied to a place of employment result in a virtual slavery.<p>This is probably not relevant to most HNers, who seem intelligent, highly qualified, and would have immediate multiple job offers should they decide to switch employment. But that is definitely not true for the majority of American workers. An employer who provides health insurance to an employee, runs a simple credit check (justified as a screening requirement or a condition of employment), and is aware of the job market situation, can easily get an idea on exactly how much pressure they can subject that employee without them jumping ship.<p>Hypothetical scenario. An employer hires Jon and Jake.<p>Jon is married, has 2 kids, $70K in student loans, his family is on his health care plan. The credit and local property search shows that they own about 30% of their $350K house, wife is unemployed.<p>Jake is not using company's health insurance plan. He either has individual insurance or is on his wife's (who is employed) health plan. His credit check shows that he has no loans whatsoever.<p>The job market in the particular sector at the particular time is not that great.<p>The infamous ""crunch time"" comes and someone needs to put in weekend hours. Everyone is stressed. Who would management ask to work on weekends without too much risk of them walking out?",1291510639

If someone is putting millions on the line to help realize your dream (for profit of course) you should respect the fact that they're investing to keep the company afloat, not to make your life (as a founder) easier.<p>People seem to equate not letting the founders cash out early with not letting them see a dime, which is not the case. They're getting paid (sort of) and in situations in which the company is no longer surviving on ramen they might even be well off in the grand scheme of things.<p>Think about it this way. Why should you, the founder, be given say 20k to pay for a wedding, while a early employee has to pay for it out of his own pocket. This is not a case of investors not being 'fair' and their decisions being despicable, it's a case of investors making a judgement call on good faith for the benefit of the company (for profit...).<p>Investors are not going to pay for your wedding as a founder because they're kind hearted or because it's the 'non-despicable' thing to do. They're going to invest in your personal life because it's a benefit for the business - plain and simple. No investor should feel they need to invest on you because it's morally correct (which is probably erroneous anyways), but if said investor feels there's a benefit to paying for your wedding/debt/porsche they will do it as a extra bit of investment on the company as a whole and not because it's a nice thing to do for your money making machine.<p>My solution: Get married when you do have money to pay for it.

They can often be in conflict when your actions have consequences on other actions (i.e. always).<p>In this specific example - yes, I think that claiming ownership over everything your employee does is slightly evil (common practice, though).  However, without that legal protection, why would you ever share the rest of your IP with the employee?  Why would you ever let them work on anything other than their immediately-assigned job duties?  You end up with a culture that's fairly similar to most big companies, where employees are told only what they need to do their jobs, and managers tightly control everything that an employee works on.  I'd say that's a far worse outcome than a culture where employees know everything that's going on in the company and have wide latitude to start projects that make things better for users.

I don't know how memory-constrained they were or how compute-constrained, but given that the ""buggy"" program still generates a target, still moves the ghost into the right general direction mostly, and is undetectable to users (except by extreme power-players), it's entirely possible that they would have decided to leave it.

Pretty sure those are the top states in the US for software innovation. I can see how the two are connected too. Employees retain rightful ownership of their work they do at home for themselves. Many of these employees will then leave and found new, innovative creative companies using the things they made on their own dime using their own personal resources. In States where the rights of people to the fruits of their labor are not respected, there is no where near as much innovation, no where near as many new companies and products and employment growth.",1291507495

Later on for curiosities sake one can learn to program without it! OTP codifies many of the best practices that experts in this type of process based concurrency model use every day.<p>It is nice to be finished with the book and we are really proud of it. These days we are back to Erlware, resurrecting the project from a two year hibernation, and also planning for the next ErlangCamp.",1291507411

But the point of the article is that the government is using this as a loophole to get around it's constitutional restriction on censoring speech.<p>The question then is, how can we maintain our speech rights when the government is using corporations as proxies for it's censorship?  In the AT&T wiretapping case from a couple years ago it became clear that even when the corporation is engaging in criminal activity at the behest of the government, the government can just turn around and grant it retroactive immunity.  At this point it seems that there is nothing the government cannot do as we continue our slide towards authoritarianism.",1291507397

I don't use it for myself, as I am quite content to be called a programmer. One could argue that a guild/regulatory body would put us in a stronger position to negotiate salaries, via a kind of artificial shortage (since some individuals won't get certified). But the last thing that I want, personally, is to have to answer to any kind of guild that tries to tell me that I am or am not a ""proper"" programmer.",1291507349

If you live in a city you might be able to do without a car. Also, if you have an extra room, you can try renting it out or listing on airbnb (no affiliation). The point is that sometimes you can find low-bandwidth opportunities to make or save a little extra cash on the side.",1291507340

To use another example, if the Macondo well had come online, BP would have saved hundreds of millions by skimping on safety measures.  However, there's not enough profit to justify the risk for Amazon, and they're cutting WikiLeaks off for that reason alone.<p>In business its not about the law - that's what high priced law firms are for.  Its about profit, and no business will fight the good fight if there's no money at the end.  Just look at Google and Net Neutrality.  As long as network providers were refusing to negotiate, Google was raising holy hell about network neutrality and traffic shaping.  However, the moment some started to negotiate, Google dropped its hard line and crafted a joint statement riddled with exceptions and caveats.<p>Corporations are powerful but fickle allies.  Take heart when they're fighting on your side, but don't count on them to do so to the end.  They'll drop you and your cause the moment it becomes clear that there are other ways to secure their profit.",1291507203

This is his clever way of getting around Bell&#x27;s Theorem.<p>His networks don&#x27;t require space to exist, they are space. When we think of spacetime, we think of a manifold, and he&#x27;s saying that what looks like a manifold at a macro level is really just a discrete network at a micro level, and this sort of data structure is more suitable for explaining non-local phenomena, because locality is an effect, not a property, of the model. But for that to work, he has to derive all the current laws from his new model, and he is far from doing that, even though it is a quite <i>fantastic</i> thought experiment.<p>I think the confusion comes from the fact that at a fundamental level, we do not have the capability to know anything but models and abstractions derived from sense data, and no one is claiming their theories are more than models.",1449100613

The power will be distributed throughout society, so there isn&#x27;t a single point of failure and/or corruption.<p>And here&#x27;s where you fail. What you have missed is that you aren&#x27;t getting rid of power structures. You&#x27;re replacing an <i>explicit</i> set of power structures with equally explicit rules with a set of <i>implicit</i> structures with no explicit rules. From there, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s a total shitshow.<p>You still get single points of failure. You still get corruption. You have just jettisoned your ability to deal with any of them effectively.<p>> There&#x27;s no such thing as an identical balance here, the balance will always be imperfect, but it is up to the individuals in the society to understand this balance, and try to make it as good as it can be.<p>Excuse me. An identical balance <i>for all individuals</i>.  A balance that is good for one person is incredibly bad for another. You&#x27;re imposing uniformity where uniformity is unsuited.<p>> If it helps, consider the new model for inclusivity will be closer to YouTube than TV.<p>I am considering your model. Unfortunately, this model does not suggest what you think it does. Removing <i>explicit</i> filter systems just replaces them with <i>implicit</i> filter systems that accomplish the same tasks. Just as before, you&#x27;re confusing getting rid of explicit power structures with getting rid of power structures.<p>Consider how Digg succumbed to organized influencers. Ask yourself how your system is immune to such things. Hint: it&#x27;s not.<p>> It&#x27;ll take time to move beyond our past programming, but that&#x27;s no reason not to try.<p>Apologize to the dead created by people like you first. Consider how they came to be. Understand risk. Then come back.<p>I realize you think your reasoned discourse can convince, friend. However, all you have convinced me of is that you don&#x27;t understand why past attempts to do exactly what you advocate have failed and why the consequences were so severe. That places you somewhere on the spectrum between misguided (if largely ignored) and incredibly dangerous (if heeded).<p>I suggest you start with learning about formal and informal power structures.

I understand this is just an Op-Ed, but for the life of me I don&#x27;t understand why it is so hard for people to grasp the core issue regarding surveillance and the internet.<p>The Constitution. The fourth amendment to be precise, is very specific about this: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<p>So while I do agree there should be some discussion about the details of the fourth, and what it applies to (does data on your ISP rented cable modem deserve the same level of fourth amendment protection as your actual computer, for example), but in general I think we can say that data is a &quot;paper&quot; and/or &quot;effects&quot;, and generally deserves such protections at the very least on equipment we own. (I know some will dispute this and I look forward to such discussion.)<p>That being said, when I see things like the following, I understand that what is being said is that other countries don&#x27;t want to follow our process of law, which I think is absurd!<p>&quot;So if a British cop is investigating a murder in London, and he has good reason to believe that Google or Facebook has evidence about the crime, he must satisfy an American judge using an American constitutional standard to obtain the evidence. This cross-border process is notoriously slow. Requests take an average of 10 months — an eon in a criminal investigation — and many languish for years.&quot;<p>&quot;Making it harder for the police to get criminal evidence lawfully may actually incentivize them to seek that data by snooping.&quot;<p>All I have to say is...<i>Get a warrant!!!</i><p>It&#x27;s possible the warrant system for electronic data is too slow, and if that&#x27;s the case work on changing that system, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you get to throw out basic law because it&#x27;s inconvenient. Hell, if we let this kind of logic apply to other areas, what good would the law be in the first place?<p>Look, the bottom line is that national sovereignty is still important, because when it comes down to it, people from a country operate under that countries laws, and we need to stop pretending otherwise.<p>&quot;If America fails to allow such access, it will happen anyway in a brute and extralegal manner — and the result will be a less secure, less efficient Internet.&quot;<p>And I fully hope that any police officers or other LEAs/LEOs who participate wilfully in and with full knowledge in violations of their oaths should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and this includes the NSA. I&#x27;m getting tired of allowing UK/European style disdain for the rule of law to seep into the American way of doing things. We fought a bloody revolution to form our government, and we shouldn&#x27;t piss it away so easily with international agreements of a questionable nature.<p>The SCOTUS has repeatedly ruled that even so called &quot;illegal aliens&quot; are protected by the Constitution under the equal protection clause. So I understand that this article focuses on the UK/European citizens data the resides in America, the bottom line is that any passage of laws contrary to this should be challenge-able on Constitutional grounds in higher-courts.<p>Of course the real danger is not that police will illegally spy... it&#x27;s that they will find some loophole to legally spy by pushing the rule of law system out of the way and will try to interface directly with corporations and companies. So it would be Company A just giving any international police access to whatever they want pretty much, probably through some EULA/TOS legalese claims that don&#x27;t really stand up to scrutiny. Which is exactly what I expect from any country other than my own (America).<p>This is an <i>extremely</i> dangerous and slippery slope, and the American people need to understand these dangers and confront them head on before we wake up having lost our country through treaty and agreement attrition.<p>tldr - It&#x27;s about the constitution and the rule of law. We silently acquiesce at not just our peril, but at the peril of all the people of the world. Beware the calls for global governance models and increased centralization!

Or changes to HTTPS that would make this possible?<p>My first thoughts are:<p>1. Connecting via HTTPS, detecting an invalid cert, and then requesting a valid cert from the target website over the MitM&#x27;ed connection, and just passing the rest of the traffic over the MitM&#x27;ed connection encrypted w/ the valid cert. The problem with this is that any standardized way of requesting the cert could be blocked by the MitM attacker.<p>2. Preload a large database of certs and connect via HTTPS, detect an invalid cert, and send data over the MitM&#x27;ed connection encrypted with the cert from your database, then have the server when they receive an encrypted request, decrypt it with their private key, and if it&#x27;s still not valid, decrypt it again with their private key. This is harder to detect and block by the MitM because encrypted data, which is essentially random, could look like valid data, but it&#x27;s also hard to detect on the server because <i>actually</i> random data could be used to DDOS the server (send it random data and it infinite loops).<p>Are there other approaches, or ways to fix the problems I see with these approaches?",1449098942

First, note that the existence of the islands and their habitability depends on the high point, not the average or the current value (okay, that&#x27;s my intuition at least). The high point in 1992-95 was about 1cm; the high point in 2012-2015 was about 20cm. [I chose those bounds to try to avoid the dip in 1998 that we may be entering again - not sure how to interpret that without more historical data.] Second, they only have about 180cm of leeway, so that&#x27;s ~1/10th of the way there. On a scale of 0-180, I think a shift of about 20 over 23 years is significant.<p>Meta point:<p>The whole reason I initial responded to you was that you were badly failing to argue your point. You wrote a couple posts above &quot;Why then did you explicitly call me out, and call me a crackpot, for not defending that claim? If you agree with it?&quot;. Do you not see the difference? I called you a crackpot <i>precisely</i> for not defending it, and just insisting it was true several times despite challenges. It has nothing to do at all with whether I agree with it.

You certainly <i>could</i> do that.  But I think that&#x27;s less useful.  If you use a specific number of hours as the benchmark you lose most of your relationship to useful levels of competence.  I think each domain has natural levels of competence that have meaning, and it&#x27;s probably better to keep the discussion oriented around that.<p>For a ukelele or guitar player, knowing enough to play the majority of pop songs is probably significant.  For a piano or violin player maybe the bar for basic competence is a bit higher.  For partner dancing it seems like the level you need to be to safely dance on a crowded public dance floor and make most partners feel comfortable is probably a pretty important level of skill to talk about.  These levels are also personal.  Maybe one budding pianist is happy with pop songs, but you&#x27;re not going to be happy until you can play a full piano concerto.  Perhaps your goal is just to be able to write a few computer programs, but a company hiring wants people who understand more about what it takes to maintain larger projects over a longer period of time.<p>When it comes down to how decisions are made in the real world nobody cares about how many hours you&#x27;ve practiced.

This is so strikingly uniform that I am disinclined to think it an accident. Why would this time be any different at all, given that we&#x27;re still dealing with the same nearly-hairless primates?&quot;<p>The difference is that it won&#x27;t be a small group in power, taking away the rights of people. The power will be distributed throughout society, so there isn&#x27;t a single point of failure and/or corruption.<p>> &quot;You have also erred in other ways, such as assuming that an identical balance between the individual and the collective is desirable for all.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as an identical balance here, the balance will always be imperfect, but it is up to the individuals in the society to understand this balance, and try to make it as good as it can be.<p>> &quot;Further, you&#x27;ve assumed that breaking down current power structures will be followed by your preferred &quot;means of organizing society&quot; being adhered to instead of new power structures being established.&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t state that direct democracy would definitely lead to communism, I stated that it would be a useful step to take before communism. In other words, should direct democracy take off, communism is not guaranteed, but it helps pave the way should people decide they want a communist society.<p>> &quot;You&#x27;ve also ignored tribe-forming behaviors that can be reasonable expected to occur around active, inclusive, informative news media.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that tribes will form, but respect can still exist between tribes. For example, I&#x27;m not on the right-wing of the political spectrum but I can still respect thoughtful individuals that are. Furthermore, healthy debate is invigorating, people aren&#x27;t only drawn to that which they agree with, debates between tribes can draw a crowd, especially if both groups feel well represented.<p>Also, I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding what I mean by an &#x27;inclusive, informative&#x27; news media, which isn&#x27;t surprising. Inclusivity is important to ensure all views can be heard, the only way this is going to happen is by removing the filters that control mass media. If it helps, consider the new model for inclusivity will be closer to YouTube than TV.<p>However, this is only part of the solution, increasing available information doesn&#x27;t help unless we can make sense of that information, which is why it is important for media to be informative. Extending the YouTube analogy further, every person is free to have their own channel, but efforts would be made to create cross channel content, either to refine the message of one &#x27;tribe&#x27;, or to engage with those they disagreed with. The easier these types of collaborative efforts are to organise and promote, the better chance we have of increasing our collective political consciousness.<p>> &quot;I think that primates are instinctual hierarchical creatures, much given to hierarchies of power. I think we are also subject to a wide variety of cognitive flaws and easily misled by emotions. I think that any political philosophy based on blithely ignoring the traits of human psychology are is highly likely to fail. I further think that historical attempts to do so have displayed a disturbing tendency towards spectacular failure.&quot;<p>It&#x27;ll take time to move beyond our past programming, but that&#x27;s no reason not to try. The misguided attempts of the past show is that trying to force change through a totalitarian means is not desirable, it&#x27;s important to raise our collective consciousness first, get people exploring new ways of living together without hierarchical social structures. Once we&#x27;ve had chance to understand this on a personal level, it&#x27;ll be easier to get working on a larger scale.",1449097674

It takes a lot less in terms of materials and space to make a single 8 MW turbine than it takes to generate the same amount of power with a large number of smaller ones.<p>Yes, if they go down you lose a large amount of capacity in one go, but that does not weigh against the cost of a large number of smaller turbines that will go down much more frequently with smaller losses (they still need to be repaired). Though the cost to repair them will likely be lower per instance the people doing the service still have to be called out.<p>I love this google project and I&#x27;m really curious what will come out but what with wind being my life-long side interest and having seen a large number of fantastic designs come with a hurricane of fanfare and go again without a breeze I&#x27;m not going to bet on this until there is much more hard data to compare to &#x27;conventional&#x27; systems.<p>Three blade conventional machines are anything but, they&#x27;re engineering marvels with a ton of materials science behind them, it took nearly 40 years to go from the 10 KW prototypes at Petten (in NH, NL), to the giants you see today. That&#x27;s a lot of R&D invested over a very long period of time.<p>Now these kites can leverage some of that knowledge and they no longer have to validate the concept of windpower for regular consumption, that trail has already been blazed so they should have an easier time of it.<p>Here&#x27;s to hoping that it works, and that it won&#x27;t end up next to &#x27;windtree&#x27; or the &#x27;windbelt&#x27; or a hundred other revolutionary wind technologies that ended up being stillborn.",1449097595

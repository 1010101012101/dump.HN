After moving ~4-5 times since going to college and graduate school, I have vowed to buy only eBooks now.  Conveniently, I am also finally basically done buying academic textbooks (for which eBook versions can be scarce), having bought most of the ones I plan to use (often enough to not borrow a library copy) during my PhD and beyond.<p>2) In my experience, eBooks don't make it easy to annotate.  Copies of my books from A Great Gatsby to Introduction to Biology are rife with pencilled in thoughts, arrows, underlines, etc.  I've even enjoyed reading notes left by previous students in copies of books I've borrowed from the library (I am thinking of some comments I vehemently disagreed with in the Harvard library copy of Sartre's Search for Method, and to which I responded in turn).

This. <arbitrary Internet jargon indicating agreement>.<p>This article is the best-articulated explanation of why programming should be a core part of the college, and even K-12 curriculum I have ever seen. I just can't agree more.<p>An anecdote.<p>When my girlfriend was still in school she needed to collect a great deal of data for a project. It was available for sale from industry groups and such, but she didn't have tens of thousands of dollars for a membership. So she resigned herself to harvesting it manually.<p>When I noticed what she was doing I pointed out that I could make this process easier for her by writing a small computer program. A few lines of Javascript and Python later she had her data, and in a small fraction of the time it would have taken her otherwise.<p>I explained, in general terms, what was going on in the program and why it worked the way it did, and explained some of the changes I could make if she needed it to work differently. The programming involved here was not in <i>any way</i> difficult or clever. The interesting thing was that she had never even considered the fact that her problem could be solved using computer programming.<p>She commented to me a couple months later, after I'd helped her with a couple other small problems in the same vein, that she had started to see problems that could be solved easily with a little bit of code everywhere she went. I didn't coach this response out of her, she was honestly amazed at what could be accomplished and she continues to view the world differently because of this exposure.<p>Now, she certainly hasn't become a ""computer programmer"" since (and she likely never will). But gaining a basic understanding of what can be accomplished using programming tools has actually changed the way she views problems.<p>Edit: I noticed people are concerned that having too many people with just enough knowledge to screw things up might be a bad thing. In my girlfriend's case the opposite has been true. She hasn't all of a sudden decided she can solve every problem by writing some code (or convincing someone else to write code).<p>On the contrary, she actually has a better appreciation for how computer programs work and why writing a new one may not be a good idea in all cases. For example, she understands why a custom application requires maintenance, and that maintenance isn't just some trivial thing that you hire an intern to take care of. In fact, she has actually talked her boss <i>out of</i> having new applications created because she realized that the projects would likely end in failure.",1337096588

You'll just dilute the brand, and right now being a coder is valued today for whole host of reasons.  As evidence of the faked resume scandal at yahoo.  It's cool, but there will be a day when it goes back to being very uncool.  And doing things like what Jeff is rallying against will help drive us there.  On the other hand non-coders want to understand what we do and how we do it.  Just like I find watching construction workers build things or a plumber fix things.  Its fun.<p>When I was an undergrad the first lecture I had in CS was my favorite.  Still is.  It discussed how fundamental scientific discoveries and technology affect how humans view the world and solving problems.  To quickly paraphrase as industrialization began to take shape we saw the world as a machine.  And so we looked for problems that could be solved by viewing them as a machine.  As electricity was discovered and commercialized we saw the world as a circuit.  Our brain compared to a circuit, and our nerves were the wires.  Is our brain an actual circuit well not entirely, but this idea helped us make other discoveries about the brain.  As each of these technologies took root in the minds of humans we shifted our paradigms and began to solve problems differently than prior generations or prior paradigms.  These paradigms tend to have long life cycles going on for decades, and that's why they are important to recognize.<p>The introduction of computers, and particularly computer programming, has changed our paradigm again.  How we solve problems with programming is fundamentally different than how we solved it with physics, chemistry, etc.  And I think that's the life skill we want to pass along to non-coders because it changes how you approach problems.  As we take what was physical and turn it into a digital representation it changes how you use it to solve problems.

There was the Ribbon too in Office, which was radical enough a lot of users complained during release. They released the Surface and Surface 2.0 as well, though I don't know how strong their market is. Bing has done some interesting things, particularly with video search and maps. I've just gone through 5/6 divisions, 5/7 if you include Skype.<p>All of this aside, Microsoft hasn't needed to innovate to the degree of the other big players for a while. Apple needed to innovate in order to secure some set of markets in order to survive. Google wants to innovate since it needs to gather more data to boost its ad business. Amazon wants to be the retailer for everything, and anyone selling anything else (e-books, music, movies - notably) cuts into their profits, so naturally they want to cut into those markets first. Microsoft... had Windows and Office, no real issues there until Apple started to edge in on the consumer market alongside non-PC devices. Even prior to that, Vista was an attempt at innovation that resulted in major screw-up for a ton of reasons, Windows 7 was the fix. Is it really any surprise we're only seeing real innovation (in Windows) now?",1337095589

The networks databases typically must communicate over are typically much lower latency and are at the very least far less subject to spontaneous hardware failure (human error is another matter that I'll concede is certainly debatable as that has a lot to do with the complexity of your storage and network systems...).</i><p>I really wish this were true man! For many shops it is, but under load, even local networks will break down in strange ways. All it takes is dropping the right syn packet and your connect latency can shoot up to 3 seconds. It's also common to have a database system with 0.1+ light-second distances between nodes, which places a pretty firm lower bound on synchronization time.<p><i>I'm totally with you in this part. ""State"" is the magic from whence most (all?) software bugs seem to stem.</i><p>Absolutely agree; databases are simply the most complicated state monads we use. I actually count filesystems as databases: they're largely opaque key-value stores. Node-networked filesystems like coda, nfs, afs, polyserve, whatever that microsoft FS was... those are <i>exactly</i> databases, just optimized for a different use case and with better access to the kernel. SANS are a little less tricky, at least in terms of synchronization, but subject to similar constraints.<p><i>While on one hand I completely agree that one needs to select the system which best fits your data and application, the maturity of more established solutions ensures they've been shaped by a far more robust set of different contexts. They've crossed off their list far more ""fixing corner case X is now our top priority"" moments than those who have come since. They really can better address a much broader range of the needs of at least applications that have been developed to date. By comparison most ""NoSQL"" stores have advantages in a fairly narrow set of contexts.</i><p>You're totally right; traditional RDBMSs have benefited from exhaustive research and practical refinement. Strangely, most <i>other</i> old database technologies have languished. Object and graph stores seem to have been left behind, except for a few companies with specific requirements (linkedin, twitter, google, FB, amazon, etc). AP systems in general are also poorly understood, even in theory: the ongoing research into CRDTs being a prime example.<p>So to some extent the relatively new codebase of, say, Riak contributes to its horrible failures (endless handoff stalls, ring corruption, node crashes, etc). Those will improve with time; I've watched Basho address dozens of issues in Riak and it's improved tremendously over the past three years. The fundamental dynamo+vclock model is well understood; no major <i>logical</i> concerns there.<p>Now... the AP space seems pretty wide open; I would not at all be surprised to see, say, distributed eventually-consistent CRDT-based, partial-schema relational, kv, or graph DBs arise in the next ten years. Lots of exciting research going on. :)<p><i>Why don't we worry as much about choosing a filesystem to suit our app as we do a database?</i><p>If I had to guess, it's because non-esoteric local filesystems offer pretty straightforward capabilities; no relational algebra, no eventual consistency, etc. If you have access to ZFS it's a no-brainer. If you don't, there are decent heuristics for selecting ext4 vs XFS vs JFS et al, and the options to configure them (along with kernel tweaks). The failure modes for filesystems are also simpler.<p>That said, I agree that more people <i>should</i> select their FS carefully. :)",1337094302

However, the point of high school is to develop certain skills and to challenge you.<p>That being said, I'm in this situation as well. I'm a grade 12 student from Canada. However, I've decided to join the hacking and start up culture. Being in the technology industry, I, of course, started my own web design company called Design Vetica. Sam, rather than waiting, why not do it now? Soon after, we were covered in many articles. One of them, for example, is <a href=""http://www.getharvest.com/blog/2010/01/design-vetica-the-double-lives-of-high-school-entrepreneurs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getharvest.com/blog/2010/01/design-vetica-the-dou...</a> As of now, we are already looking into building our first application<p>Shameless plug aside, I think school is great, but learning should not be about getting a job. I love programming, that's why I'm going into Computer Science in university. Again, Sam, if you truly want to accomplish something, start today.<p>Two great links that talks about school:

Laying all the relevant concepts and relationships out visually worked really well for me.<p>From that angle, I think anything that helps programmers visualize the structure of their software is a good thing. I think any half-decent programmer is good at maintaining these kind of relationship graphs in their head, anyhow. But that's no reason why tooling can't make that even better. There's potential for a programmer to visualise the structure of their program, beyond what they can hold in their head.<p>I also like that this idea encourages good overall design, short logically arranged methods, and neatly compartmentalises ""workspaces"" in a visual way.<p>I have a few criticisms, though:<p>- Nowhere near enough keyboard-driving for my liking. :).<p>- It'd be great if zooming out could transform the representation a bit, so instead of ant-size pieces of code the user could work with only the higher-level abstractions between the bubbles they've laid out. I see this happening from the ""groups"" and ""workspaces"", but not being inferred from the code itself.<p>- Is there some other way to show bubbles that were opened independently, but are actually related in the code? Apart from drawing a specific line and seeing the call graph (which is neat, btw.)<p>- I'm concerned about what happens when a single workspace gets bigger than a single window.<p>- What happens when design (as it often needs to) breaks through neatly defined abstractions, and lines start needing to be drawn all over the place. Can Code Bubbles represent this without driving the programmer insane, and (also) can it represent this in a way which encourages the programmer to see better ways to refactor?<p>- Arbitrary areas and names, in a flat namespace on a flat 2D plane, with no relationships between them, is nice and simple.

I agree with your post, inasmuch as I find writing Java outside of an IDE like Eclipse limits you greatly. It sounds like you write Java a lot.<p>- OTOH, I find writing C/C++ in Emacs with cscope/etags/make support and some custom keystrokes, and functions for common Unix calls, is about as good as any IDE can get you for those languages (although I admit that I've only had limited C++ IDE experience, using Visual Studio.)<p>Yes, you have to do custom configuring to get Emacs working well. So, it's a small amount of extra upfront work over Eclipse. The upside is that you get to customize it however you want. In Eclipse I'm still using most of the default configuration, for the simple reason that it works ""well enough""<p>I find writing Erlang in Emacs erlang-mode is fine as well, mostly because the language doesn't encourage me to create the kind of horrible architectural behemoths that you _need_ an IDE to manage.<p>The difference between Language-oriented and IDE-oriented approaches to programming was laid out really well in a recent blog post that made it to HN, but I can't find it with a quick google - sorry.",1268270501

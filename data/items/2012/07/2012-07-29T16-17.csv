What would really solve end user usablity problem is improving search - and companies improving their standing not through interrupt marketing but via inbound marketing. This name-issue is moot point, because if service is large, useful and popular people will remember it or will easily find it via google. Use bookmarks and what not. Sure it is somewhat important in the startup market if you company depends of VC funds. Business card based advertising of your brand is tenuous at best...

The red color is so bright that it would attract all the user's attention and would make them ignore the important features you have advertised below<p>Red is used to implement anything important (like call-to-action buttons) and it looks like you are over-using red. Its a very bad sign, especially when the UI is one of the selling points, and especially when you are charging a premium ($20).<p>2) >A complete replacement for GMail<p>a) Is going to attract a lot of negative attention,
b) is not ethical<p>Why? Because it is not a complete replacement for Gmail and never will be.<p>Why not? Because of various reasons - UI, Features (Some features in Gmail labs aren't available with yours) and finally Price.<p>3)$20 a month for email is overkill. And there's absolutely no reason why as an end user I should use yours over Gmail, because its free. From what I see, some of the features you claim to provide, which you claim to make your app superior to Gmail fail to impress me. For example, the event scheduling. I'm sure I can do something close with Google's calendar app?<p>4)If you are targeting Gmail users, then, for what platform? PC? Mac?? Android?? iPhone??? Be clear, right now its hard to digest if this is just a weekend hack or a serious app, because the pitch of your app. isn't clear enough, atleast not on the homepage. (Being brutally honest)<p>5) There was another guy who tried the same thing - I believe its called Mailapp. It would be good for you, if you could learn from his mistakes, you can find his post here on HN and how much criticism he received despite his UI being significantly better than yours, by many folds. Read what people expect, from the comments here on HN on the mail app, I believe it would help you a lot.<p>There is a fundamental problem with such apps. Embracing Apple-sque minimal User-Interface design is a good idea only when you know what you're doing and how things should look. There is a reason why important elements like the compose button in Gmail are in red. There is a reason why links are in blue. First try to understand these reasons behind the psychology of colors before you get minimal. Making something/Marketing something minimal doesn't make you smart or superior, infact you will be offending many users because of your poor understanding of UX.

It gives little insight into what happens when a site switches from being pseudyonym-based to real named.<p>The Real Name Verification Law of 2007 required website owners verify the identities of users but did ""not force websites to reveal [their] real names"". Thus, it resulted in pseudonym-based forums that can now link to a real identity if needed and sites which always used real names but can now verify them.<p>On the pseudonym-based forum, after switching from unlinked pseudonyms, i.e. anonymity, to linkable pseudonyms ""the proportion of bad postings clearly decreased...in both short-term and long-term compared to the control group, and they are statistically significant"". The switch was ""not salient"" on the real name board that <i>always used real names</i>. Plus one TechCrunch.<p>The study readily states that the ""proportions of bad postings [on the real name forum] are smaller than those [on the pseudonym-based forum]"" across the board. This suggests a real name board <i>will</i> contain less vulgarity.<p>If one is worried about switching from unlinked to linked pseudonyms, note that the ""composition of user groups did not change over the period regardless of the law"".<p>We should also qualify articulating these findings to the United States given that ""South Koreas household broadband penetration reached 95%, which was the highest rate among those of all 57 surveyed countries"" and that their political culture tends to be a mark more boisterous than we have here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2012/4525/00/4525d041-abs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2012/4525/00/...</a>",1343579913

I knew many med-school candidates whose biggest hurdle with MCAT were physics and (to a somewhat lesser extent) chemistry requirements. Now, the way you learn physics is either you memorize a huge amount of rules and equations (which is exhausting and takes forever), or you learn only a few basic intuitive principles (say Newton's laws when it comes to mechanics or Maxwell's equations when it comes to electromagnetism), and then apply algebra, calculus, and trigonometry to extend those basic principles to the problem at hand. Chemistry requires more rote memorization than physics, but even there knowing how to balance chemical equations reduces to knowing basic algebra. Taken to the extreme, I learned first-hand that it is possible to pass college-level physics with flying colors with little or no studying, but it requires being good at math.<p>TL;DR A huge amount of college-level material, from economics to physics to chemistry depends on working knowledge of algebra.",1343579876

Now we have hashes for file handling (in git), hashes for users in Google+, hashes for money (bitcoin). I think we are going towards a world full of hashes (pun half-intended).<p>If we had a single hash used for identifiying a piece of content (eg a given blog post, the home for this blog, a comment to this blog post), then a web site would just be a hash table, you would ask for hash 3ed44a2d38 and get the content. That may include other hashes. Then search engines would just be weighted keyword->hash tables. Content would be passed along servers and proxies in a p2p way. Because hash is unique to a content, you won't care if the bits are served by X or Y, as long as the hash checks.<p>Then no need for domain names anymore: Wanna go to BBC website? Search for BBC and pray your search engine has it as #1. Wanna bookmark the home of BBC website or an article? Store the hash.<p>Issues:<p>- Over reliance on search engine and links. Answer: we do have this issue already.<p>- Authentication of content: is this really BBC website? This can be fixed similarly to current certification system, and you would certify your main home's hash.<p>- BS! That's no real hash! What do I mean? Yes, right, the main issue is that content is changing, so a real hash would be changing too. I said google user id is a hash, that's wrong (or is it?), it looks like one though. I have been fiddling too much with git recently. For me the best of the world is when files, dirs, actions, everything is unique, unmodifiable, and identified per its hash. Any modification of the state of the world generates new content, relations, and their hashes. Infinite history for free. But how to apply this to the Web? Can we?

It's not a requirement of being anonymous, but it's a part of the culture of imageboards: you're expected to be brash about anything you don't like. If you don't, you come off as a newbie.<p>This is why I think anything that happens in 4chan should stay there: because the very culture of 4chan only makes sense there. When you take it to a site like HN, where anonymity is less common, you make the discussion unilateral. A HN user is probably not going to say everything they think about /g/ under an username that's associated with their real name elsewhere. So we have /g/ telling everything that's wrong with HN (with the usual hyperbole) but not HN telling everything that/s wrong with /g/, either for fear of reprisal or fear of a ban.<p>I don't really frequent /g/, but I suppose that we could point out their flaws and stereotypes too, like they do to us (that HN is too supportive of Apple, that we're entrepreneur wannabes, that we take ourselves too seriously, that we're ""design hipsters"" (?)) but since we don't have the absolute anonymity and brazen attitude of 4chan, we'll never make this discussion truly honest.<p>As for their complaint about our pretentiousness: when you're writing under your name, or for your company, there's no way of not being a little pretentious and taking yourself too seriously.",1343578743

Students think things like ""Algebra is Math and I hate Math so I hate Algebra"" or ""Math is my worst subject."" It is an easy label to associate their failures with.<p>An example of learning without boundaries:<p>One day, I decide I want to play the guitar. I get my hands on one and fiddle around. Perhaps a brief history on the instrument will give me some better context as to why the instrument is shaped as it is, and what all the features are. An exposure to famous guitarists and their music improves my appreciation of music and gives me context to work with. As I continue to struggle with notes and basic music theory, it may be a good time to take a brief detour into the realm of physics - a lesson in simple harmonics. If interested, I can dive further into the required algebra relevant to harmonic equations. Hmm... maybe learning to use a computer program can help me figure out how messing with these waves changes the sound...<p>And so it goes. A familiar story to most hackers, but sadly an approach that most educational systems do not encourage.<p>Is this exploratory form of learning superior? My theory is that the associations formed between nodes of knowledge are necessary for any sort of actual deep learning to occur. By sandboxing subjects, the standard school curriculum limits the possible associations that students think are allowed, thus limiting the probability of successful links between nodes. Even an above average student can graduate from college, and be left with nothing but a bunch of barely reachable random islands of knowledge, floating further out to sea every day.<p>In other words: school sucks, learning rules.",1343578070

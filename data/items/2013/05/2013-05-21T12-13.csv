5743301,comment,5743057,5743227,4,0,kijin,,,"I didn't know that ""a modest proposal"" was a phrase with satirical connotations. TIL. I simply meant that what I'm proposing is much less radical than many of the ideas I've seen floating around in the tech community lately.<p>I use LastPass and it usually doesn't miss login forms, either. But sometimes it makes mistakes that need manual correction, like trying to log in via the signup page, or loading the home page when the login form is actually on a different page, or remembering the value of every checkbox on the login form (even those with style=""display:none""). Some websites also use weird tricks like loading an HTTPS login form in an iframe injected by jQuery, etc. This post was written because I got frustrated with mistakes like that and I realized that there's only so much second-guessing that a third-party tool like LastPass can do.<p>I don't let any software remember my bank passwords, so the issue of ridiculously convoluted logins didn't occur to me. Perhaps we could compile a public database of how certain websites (mis)behave, and tell browsers to handle such cases according to a script. But I guess we'll never be able to convince banks that automation like this prevents phishing better than the status quo does.<p>I also didn't want to propose anything that would require any more than a couple of lines of code to be changed on the server side. Switching from HTML login forms to HTTP auth would require more than a couple of lines to be changed on the server side.",1369141146

If AirBnB became a serious economic force in NYC, it would only make my outrageously expensive city more expensive as apartment rents converged upwards towards hotel rates.<p>3.

There are many things that I need to do in my daily routine, that would be solved by simple utilities that are known and available in the Ubuntu/Debian repository and that work well. In Windows, even for things like compressing or uncompressing a format that's not ZIP, or for mounting an ISO file, or for burning DVDs, or playing music, or whatever, you end up installing proprietary software that's either broken, or mallware, or bloated crap, or all of the above.<p>These are just examples from the last time I tried, YMMV, but this happens every time I try it. Last time on my Windows desktop at home, I tried playing around with the latest Visual Studio Express. The installation process simply choked and I ended up with a broken Windows. It's like every time I try using Windows I experience death through a thousand cuts.<p>In general, most of the utilities I end up using on a Windows box are ports of software who's primary audience comes from Linux/BSD and why not use the real thing anyway?<p>Also, I don't really need games because I'm playing the greatest MMORPG of all time ... being a software developer.",1369140932

5743266,comment,5742482,5742482,2,0,kmike84,,,"Great writeup (and a cool metaclass workaround!)<p>However, I think that ""Drop 2.5, 3.1 and 3.2"" advice is bad - dropping 2.5 and 3.1 is the way to go (hey, drop 2.5 even if you're not porting to 3.x), but dropping 3.2 is not necessary in most cases.<p>In my experience (porting and maintaining 20 open-source packages that work with Python 2 and Python 3 using a single codebase, including NLTK) Python 3.2 has never been a problem - I don't see how NLTK code and code of my other packages could be improved by dropping Python 3.2 compatibility.<p>The main argument for dropping Python 3.2 support seems to be that u'strings' are not supported in Python 3.2. There are 3 ""types"" of strings in Python:<p>* b""bytes"",<p>* ""native strings""  # bytes in 2.x and unicode in 3.x<p>* u""unicode""<p>By adding `from __future__ import unicode_literals`` line to a top of the file, code compatible with 2.6-3.2 could be written like this:<p>* b""bytes""<p>* str(""native string"")  # bytes in 2.x and unicode in 3.x<p>* ""unicode""<p>In my opinion this is not a hack (unlike six.b and six.u necessary for 2.5 support), and this is arguably closer to Python 3.x semantics (unicode strings are default). So IMHO while using u""unicode"" feature from Python 3.3 makes porting somewhat easier (less stupid search-replace), it also could make code worse and more cluttered, and Python 3.2 - compatible syntax is just fine.<p>It is true that 3.3 brings other improvements (Armin mentioned binary codecs), but it is quite rare that the library actually needs them (even libraries as big as NLTK and Django are fine with 3.2 stdlib).<p>3.2 is a default 3.x Python in current Ubuntu LTS (EOL in 2017) and a default 3.x Python in the recently released Debian Wheezy; 3.2 will be around for a long time, and not supporting it will hurt. So if you're doing Python 3.x porting, please just fix those stupid u'strings' with unicode_literals future import - your code will be more ideomatic and also 3.2 compatible.<p>There is also an advice for encoding __repr__ and __str__ results to utf8 under Python 2.x in the article; this is fine (other approaches are not better), but it has some non-obvious consequences (like breaking REPL in some setups) that developers should be aware of, see <a href=""http://kmike.ru/python-with-strings-attached/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kmike.ru/python-with-strings-attached/</a><p>For lower-level 2.x-3.x compatible C/C++ extensions Cython is great. In fact, many libraries (e.g. lxml) are compatible with Python 3.x because they are written in Cython which generates compatible code (modulo library changes) by default.",1369140754

All of the major music, television show, and movie stores run there.  Virtually all of the gaming digital download stores run there.  Almost all of the file sharing applications run there.  All of the TV tuner hardware works there.  If you want to consume media the Windows is ideal.  Even though Windows is an ideal desktop for the consumption of media there is something much more important.<p>Windows holds the lead as the top desktop for the production of anything creative: code, graphics, music, videos, and games.  While certain parts of this may not be without frustration (I'm looking at you, Visual Studio) the support provided is generally superior to what you find in the Linux world (there is no Linux parallel to MSDN).  Photoshop has no peer in the professional image manipulation world, though GIMP could fill that role for an ambitious amateur.  Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premere or Sony Vegas are in no way threatened by any free software solution.  While Ardour is amazing, Cubase and Pro Tools make it look like a joke in a professional environment.<p>Linux excels as the platform that ties the Internet together.  Windows, by and large, sucks as a server.  Any of the major free software mail transfer agents (sendmail, postfix, exim) blow Exchange Server out of the water for email (not counting all of the other things Exchange Server does).  IIS is a sick joke compared to Apache, lighttpd, and nginx.

Inferno is the hardest difficulty level, and there's 10 settings of monster power to tailor the difficulty to your preference / gear.

I was using it to mean profit but you are using it to mean costs.  My gut feeling is that taxing costs instead of profit will lead to warped incentives, but I admit I cannot think of a good example just now.<p>> You're asking how common it is for a company to have a less than 10% profit margin?<p>No - I wasn't clear, sorry.  I was thinking a company might typically have the following costs as a percentage of revenue: (a) domestic costs 40%; (b) imports from high-tax countries 25%; (c) imports from low-tax countries 25%.  Increasing this last figure to 27.5% would not wipe out the company's profit margin.<p>> the value of that non-geographically-dependent asset ... can be whisked off to an entity in a low tax jurisdiction<p>A company's advantage over its rivals often geographically dependent.  Toyota's famed culture of lean, just-in-time manufacturing allowed it to become the biggest carmaker in the world.  That culture was a company asset rooted in Japan that could not be whisked to any tax haven.<p>As for intellectual property, is there absolutely no way to structure the tax code so that growth in the value of these assets can be taxed?  What about a simple rule that says IP cannot be transferred across borders within the same company?  That is, the value of a patent is tied to the country in which the R&D was done.  The value of a book's copyright is tied to the country in which it was written.  The value of a software licence is tied to the country in which the software was developed. Etc.<p>> The problem simply is that you can't have significantly higher taxes than the next country on anything that can be easily removed from your jurisdiction, or that is exactly what will happen. And the profits of international corporations fall into that category.<p>If that was the case then the corporation tax for most of the Fortune 500 would be zero.  The current system, although imperfect, is still somewhat functional.",1369139509

The approach I took is to use a hardware device with limited login attempts to generate store most of my (random, 16 character) passwords (an IronKey, in my case).<p>IronKey have a reset mechanism involving security questions; I've never used it, and I don't know the answers I gave; they're on a sheet of paper, in a safe somewhere. Yes, it's going to be inconvenient if I ever need it, but if it happened tomorrow it would be a once-in-ten-years event.<p>My bank inconveniently REQUIRES security questions in addition to a PIN for online banking; again, the information they have is made up. I remember it because I use it regularly, so that ISN'T written down anywhere.<p>For almost anything else less important, I've either just ignored the security questions (ie. entered random data) or noted them in the extra account info field on the IronKey.<p>For email, I run my own mail server in colo. It's maybe overkill, but I don't care. Credentials are again 16 character random passwords that I couldn't tell you, and authentication is only allowed over TLS. I'm toying with going for full client SSL certificates but device support would be the issue. I've already discovered more than I wanted to about incompatible SSL implementations on mobile devices over the years, which is why I'm still building Debian packages from source linking to OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS... And there's no webmail access. Never did find one that wasn't either written in PHP, half-functional or abandoned.",1369137715

5743038,comment,5741823,5742580,1,0,svv,,,"Well, pure mathematic models also don't have any real-world meaning, and no predictive power with regard to the real world events. Still, nobody thinks that the analytical proof of the Pythagorean theorem is somehow inferior to the empirical one (involving multiple reproducible experiments that measure sides of the actual triangles drawn on a piece of paper with a ruler). We are content with mathematics being consistent within itself.<p>However, if we (1) add certain assumptions about, say, physical laws, the structure of the reality, the way we can observe it, (2) propose a reasonable way to map some aspects of the world to our mathematical models, (3) calibrate the result according to the future experiments/observations -- we might get a quite useful natural science like physics or astronomy.  The pure math will serve only as a low-level tool.  That's how the Austrian economists see the place of the pure economics theory: just an analytical tool to be used along with the other disciplines/sciences for solving real-world problems.<p>For example: Austrian economists believe that it can be deduced from the first principles/axioms that enforcing minimal wage above existing market wages results in involuntary unemployment (most of the non-Austrian economists also believe this is the case, although their methodological basis is different). Assume there was a policy act that included, among other things, raising the minimal wage. A year passed, and it so happened that there have been changes in the economy indicators, including <i>lower</i> unemployment rate. The act was not the only thing that happened in that time; lots of factors may have contributed to the outcome. An Austrian researcher will definitely not count raise-the-minimal-wage factor as contributing in favor of the lower unemployment rate; the factor will be counted against the lower-unemployment-rate outcome, and will require further explanations, what other factors have outweighed its effect.<p>Using math (well, formal systems/notations) does not guarantee your whole research about the real world is correct, but it establishes a baseline for consistency and rigorous reasoning.  It's the same with basic economics.<p>(My formal education was in mathematics / CS. I study economics, epistemology etc. only as a hobby.)",1369137651

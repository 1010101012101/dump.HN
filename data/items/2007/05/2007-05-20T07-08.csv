23364,comment,23300,23308,0,0,davidw,,,"Excellent list, and pretty much precisely what I would have posted with a few very minor tweaks: Ruby and Python are nearly interchangeable.  Time is limited, so have a look at both and pick which one you like.  Tcl is also a neat language in some ways - it's even better for DSL's than Ruby is, and has the lisp like property that you can create your own control structures.<p>Anyway, jaggederest's list is pretty much <i>the list</i> to learn if you want a broad overview.",1179645512

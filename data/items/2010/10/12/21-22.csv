I do trust friends and co-workers to recommend movies or restaurants because most people have seen hundreds of movies and eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Both most people have had only 1 or 2 dentists in their entire lives. They have no basis of comparison to say whether their dentist is any good.<p>You might as well choose randomly from a phone book. That's what I did when I moved to a new city. Actually I looked for dentists that were close to me, that spoke English natively (I live in a very cosmopolitan city), whose dental degrees were more than 5 years ago (gained experience) but less than 20 years (not outdated), and whose staff were pleasant and prompt on the phone (on the theory that the behavior of the staff will reflect the character of the boss).<p>Thus I picked my dentist without a recommendation and without meeting or speaking with him, but I think my method is less arbitrary than asking your friends and co-workers.

It is your right to have those copies of your dental history.\n* If the XRays don't show the cavities, there are  not at a level where you need to treat them yet.

The problem is that people don't go to the dentist just to have cavities filled.  My first trip to my current dentist happened due to a severely painful toothache (to call it in ache is like calling a broken leg a paper cut).  I had my bride do some research of local dentists (whatever she could cram into 5 minutes on google) and went with the guy that I perceived as having the best technology (but really the main criteria was the most open schedule).<p>What followed was a great experience: after 2 hours of patching things up, my pain was almost completely gone.  After a few days of antibiotics, it was gone.  The shot required to numb the area didn't hurt (it may have under normal circumstances, but ... ""broken leg"").  That single correction brought me back on schedule.  I had a filling that was sensitive.  He replaced it with a ""new material"", it was more sensitive, so he replaced it again with a different bonding (Neither I nor my insurance were charged) and that sensitivity went away.  No cavity filled since then has been sensitive.<p>I've had a handful of cavities, and I return, reluctantly, but my loyalty lies more in the fact that I had a tangible, identifiable problem (excruciating pain, and later sensitivity) and he troubleshot it until it was fixed to my satisfaction.  I wouldn't see another dentist simply because I believe this particular dentist to be predictable.  I'll have a problem, he'll fix it.  I, like other commentators, have a dentist who uses more than just X-Rays to diagnose cavities.  At the moment, I have three spots on the X-Ray and DIAGNOdent that he has said he'd like to ""wait on"" because he wasn't sure.  I had thought -- due to my past experience with tooth pain -- that ""waiting on"" something like that was asking for trouble, but now I'm wondering if I have a Dentist who understands the limitations of the technology he uses.",1286918953

1785044,comment,1783788,1784658,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"I assign no stereotype to any OKCupid users (I am not even sure I have heard of it before), I do feel perhaps that some peoples insecurities about using a dating website are causing them to take this out of context (I accept my wording may not have been delicate enough). In 1995 I dated a girl I met through IRC or a similar such service, and the few single friends I have I often encourage to at least investigate online services, so I don't fall into any category of people who judge people who use these services. I would say that (at least in the UK) probably a slight majority of the people <i>I know</i> are still uncomfortable with the idea of meeting someone online. It is likely that online dating will become more and more prevalent, will it ever totally eclipse other ways of meeting people, I don't know - and yes I am a dinosaur in that I honestly hope that finding love doesn't come down to a computer metric and getting along via a few emails. The spark of meeting someone special in the flesh, eyes meeting across the room etc is something I hope is never replaced by a computer matching you to someone with similar interests (my wife is amazing, we have an amazing relationship and I am pretty sure no computer would ever put us together - zero interests in common, that is what keeps it interesting).<p>As for no data, I did write my comment with no data to back it up. I would imagine less than 10% of comments I see on HN are made with solid information to backup someones thoughts. Most people on here are smart people that can make up their own minds and provide information from the world they see around them.<p>Did you have any data to back your comment up? Here's a start, OKCupid claim the median number of partners for both men and women, gays and straights is 6. I've just gone out and googled for such numbers, and whilst I didn't find anything definitive, I didn't find one median or average as low as 6, in fact looking at 18-35 as another commentator points out as OKCupid being representative of, 9 would appear more likely (my guess would have been 8). So that probably supports my assumption that there is a bias to some degree - OKCupid users appear to be getting less than the average. I have no idea where OKCupid falls in the spectrum of dating sites, I have no idea how many active users there are in the world of dating websites, but I would be staggered to see statistics that extrapolate to the user base of a singles website being indicative of overall society. In 10 years time, maybe, but at this point in time I doubt it. This article is trying to claim it has real facts, all I am saying is take those facts with a grain of salt.",1286918912

There are systems in place for big things like accounting, but when it comes to day-to-day things, like tracking vacation request days, or survey results, or incident reports, mechanical failures, etc then they are on there own.  Furthermore, a lot of a company practices and policy is undocumented, outdated and/or hard to reach (i.e. you'd have to email around the company to find out who has it).<p>So I've created what I think helps solve this problem: a combination wiki and database.  This provides an office-wide, group writable, and secure website on which to put common practices, meeting minutes, to-do lists, client information, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.  While the integrated database portion makes it easy to make scalable data tracking systems and reports (so you don't have to play 'pass the excel file').

This past week TTARA had extensive discussions with the Comptroller’s office concerning the original intent and interpretation of the new language.  The Comptroller’s Office has acknowledged that the purpose of the proposed rule was indeed broader than what was stated in the preamble, but not so broad as to extend nexus to anyone using a server in Texas.<p>In order to properly clarify the intent of the rules change and more clearly state agency policy, the Comptroller’s Office will issue a new rule proposal.  William Hamner, Director of Tax Administration indicated that the agency’s intent is not to extend nexus to a person simply using a third-party server in Texas for an activity such as webhosting. ...""<p>Move along...nothing to see here",1286917274

1784938,comment,1784461,1784461,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"There are three major benefits presented by the internet to traditional media.  First, the ability to offer far greater depth and breadth of coverage than could reasonably be offered in print.  Second, the ability for the media to be instantly interactive.  While letters to the editor did allow some interactivity, they aren't nearly as interactive as what can be done online.  Finally, along the lines of interactivity, digital display should allow the media the ability to offer content that doesn't necessarily have to appeal to everyone; it should be much more feasible to target niche markets and offer content tailored to them, while profiting from the greater ability to monetize a niche market.<p>Having said that, my company, Barhopolis (check out <a href=""http://barsannapolis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://barsannapolis.com</a>), is currently looking to partner with newspapers to more easily reach an audience.  This gives you a great breadth and depth of information, in the form of hundreds of local events updated daily.  Interactivity in the form of reviews, comments, and photos shared by visitors.  And, most importantly, it gives you access to a niche market that is easy monetizable.  We'd also be able to incorporate current and future editorial content, as well as customize the branding.  I'd love to talk to you more about it, my email is justin@bulletprooftiger.com.",1286917218

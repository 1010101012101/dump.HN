The memory management appears to be the problem. Hugely inefficient and slow even with 3.x. I get crashes frequently, even under Linux and I run production on R. Moreover, Numpy&#x27;s two orders-of-magnitude speed increase opens up a new class of problem that R just can&#x27;t handle, especially in the streaming data space. Pandas has made a big improvement in taking Python towards R, though it would be great if it were multidimensional. Where R has Python beat hands down is in its &quot;vectors everywhere&quot; functional philosophy. List comprehensions just don&#x27;t match the power, and vector indexing is uneven even in Pandas.<p>I have less experience with Matlab for cost, and lock in reasons. I need to have the option to distribute my code easily.",1431367192

We can have a convention of always setting it to UTC, but that introduces a possible source of bugs. We might call ZonedDateTime.now() and forget to pass an explicit zone. Especially if the author is a new contributor who hasn&#x27;t been told about our convention.<p>Or we might use a library which produces ZonedDateTimes with the system&#x27;s default zone. Then we have to canonicalize them at some point, and be very careful not to rely on the local date/time info prior to canonicalization.<p>I&#x27;d rather just use a type like Instant which has no time zone field, so that there&#x27;s no need for any time zone convention.<p>Further, we might need to serialize a timestamp using a non-UTC timezone, say CST which is common in payments systems. If we&#x27;re using UTC times, we might forget to convert from UTC to CST.

9526555,comment,9524607,9524607,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"To be honest, I think the influence of the Ruby/Rails ecosystem is hurting Python. In the last few years, it&#x27;s become impossible to run many Python projects without doing a pip install -r requirements.txt. That in itself would not be a problem, except that many pip packages are buggy and poorly maintained. Few people take the time to vet such libraries because the effort involved in a pip install is so low. The result is that we often spend hours configuring a buggy library instead of writing code that would do a better job solving our problems. &quot;Convention over configuration&quot; is no less important than it always was, but it&#x27;s certainly less fashionable.<p>There are exceptions. Django rest framework, for example, is an extremely mature, well-made library. But these are becoming less of a percentage of the whole and are harder to find in the chaff.<p>And there are a few projects still carrying the torch--but typically these are old projects that have been around for a long time, still maintained by older developers who were writing Python when Python was young. We still have at least a decade before these old masters start retiring, so I don&#x27;t think Python will die any time soon.

AES-NI, carry-less multiply, and CRC32 instructions are kind of like smallish (in gate area) accelerators of operations that go much easier in hardware. AMD talked about a compression accelerator for their (now-delayed) A1100 ARM server chip. These are marketed as performance features, not as power-saving, but if you can do something in fewer clock cycles without a ton of area, you are often saving on power as well.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that some savings come through finding places where slower chips will do the job because RAM and/or disk and/or bandwidth is the limiter (storage, caching, maybe some proxies and scale-out DBs now running on faster chips). Intel has server Atoms (Avoton, Rangeley) and there are experiments with ARM servers (Baidu cloud storage tried them out: <a href=""https://gigaom.com/2013/02/20/first-arm-based-servers-in-production-support-baidus-cloud-storage/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gigaom.com/2013/02/20/first-arm-based-servers-in-pro...</a>). There&#x27;s lots of work on ARMs and Atoms on the consumer side and some of the benefits may spill over to low-power servers. Don&#x27;t know how widespread this will be, though; I&#x27;ve been rooting for the concept of servers on low-power chips for years and haven&#x27;t seen much yet.<p>You also pay for higher power dissipation with lower density.

This is part of why self-driving cars could work... they will work better together than humans do.<p>But if humans are hitting them, what we need to know is why. See, my stream of consciousness on this goes something like:<p>Was the human just being careless? Or did the car do something that would be safe under normal circumstances, but didn&#x27;t fit the actual scenario, so a human was surprised by their actions?  For example, if a piece of debris flies in front of a self-driving car on the interstate, does it just stop? Or does it check behind itself, and the lanes next to it, to see if someone behind it is tailgating, so moving to another lane is safer than stopping? Do they activate their hazard lights when something is wrong up ahead, to alert the tailgater behind them? Can they judge lateral motion of an object well enough to make the call on whether the flying debris would even still be in their lane when they pass? If they judge it will miss them, but hit the guy next to them, do they move over to avoid the carnage? If they do make a lane-changing move, do they do the move I see pickups do all the time, swerving out of the way of a stopped object/car, so the person behind them is suddenly presented with the stopped object, but with way less reaction time to avoid it, thereby making the human-powered car have an accident just because the self-driving car, frankly, is driving like a dick?<p>I have no idea how deep the logic goes in accident prevention in these cars.

9526421,comment,9523538,9523538,0,0,benkuykendall,,,"Wow. This article addresses a lot of interesting points that I had not considered. It&#x27;s amazing how different museums could become with relatively small changes.<p>However, the deaccessioning arguments made me nervous. I agreed with the point that selling puts the art in no physical harm as a private buyer has just as much incentive to preserve his or her art as a museum does, but there are other problems with his model. For instance, I would not object if art was sold to set up a fund to make admission free, but I worry that a museum would sell art whenever capital was needed. Take for example the Delaware Art Museum which sold significant pieces to pay for a likely unneeded expansion [1]. If it became easy and commonplace for museums to sell art to fund other ventures, we would see conflicts of interest: perhaps the museum believes expanding its building is more important than showing an influential piece. Even if we relax the limitations on selling art, we would still need some sort of ethics code detailing when it is and is not appropriate to sell artwork and this code would have to balance the conflicting priorities of museums, donors, and the public.<p>The author also briefly touches on the issue of digitizing collections. Although at first glance digitizing a collection seems like an easy shortcut to infinity accessible art, there is certainly a difference between seeing a reproduction of art and seeing the art in person, what Walter Benjamin would call the “aura” of the piece [2]. His 1936 essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” is certainly worth a read – I have not seen a better analysis of the role of reproduction in art and society.<p>However, the issues I have brought up are just details that I think a concerted effort by a group of influential museums could overcome. I think the article overlooks one fundamental issue: the role of the art museum is not just to make art accessible to the public. For instance, the MET charges itself not only to “present significant works of art” to the public, but also to collect, study, and conserve art [3]. These last three goals may conflict with O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s idea of an ideal museum structured toward maximum engagement.<p>[1]. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/design/censured-delaware-art-museum-plans-to-divest-more-works.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/design/censured-delaw...</a><p>[2]. <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/...</a><p>[3]. <a href=""http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/mission-statement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/mission-statement</a>",1431365782

They tend to act on emotion rather than logic and it often isn&#x27;t clear which information is factual and which is rumor. People tend to be susceptible to groupthink, and often go with the crowd.<p>Having everyone dealing out justice might work if everyone was calm, rational, logical, and well-educated, which is often what game theory supposes, but that&#x27;s not how things work. In reality, I would think that such a system would result in mob violence, sometimes triggered by good information, but often triggered by hearsay and rumors.<p>Not everyone agrees what is correct behavior and what isn&#x27;t, so what would be acceptable to one person would not be acceptable to another. We&#x27;d get a lot of uncertainty whether our behavior is acceptable or not.<p>If we had a system where a mass of people decided via some sort of upvoting/downvoting, it would be a &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, where minorities would be oppressed by majorities just because they had different standards of what is acceptable behavior. Goodbye civil rights, because those would count for nothing if a member of the minority did something that offended the majority.<p>It seems to me that this is what happens in anarchical places in the world where authority has broken down. Anyone can and will dispense justice. Violence because someone was offended by someone else&#x27;s behavior (which I find completely non-offensive) is common and mob violence is common.<p>Strong authority often breeds corruption but a lack of authority can also breed disorder and chaos, an environment where people who can gather followers become a strong authority and become corrupt.

There&#x27;s 3 to 4 years between major Spring releases (Spring 2 2006, Spring 3 2009, Spring 4 2013).<p>And Java SE doesn&#x27;t release a major new version montly, let alone yearly either. A spec should move fast enough to stay relevant, but slow enough to provide the stability needed so lots of other technology can build on it.",1431365282

If Thiel is a Libertarian (haven&#x27;t looked it up, not that it matters), then supporting and making money off-of socially &quot;neutral&quot; things such as Facebook and Paypal seems like a very good representation of the things Libertarians believe in.

Most timezone conversions take a zoned date and time and convert it to a different timezone. But it matters when/where you&#x27;re doing the conversion for the reasons you&#x27;re discussing. If you also supply a UTC timestamp indicating when the conversion should take place (note, not a zoned date and time, since the conversion to the universal timeline can be affected by DST changes), that conversion can be consistent no matter when/where the function runs.<p>I find this approach to be cleaner than saving wall time since it allows you to keep uniform times on the server and simplify server-side logic that acts on those times in bulk.",1431365091

9526176,comment,9523538,9525813,0,0,VLM,,,"The local art museum is heavy on physical art, lighter on image art.  I don&#x27;t solely mean sculpture.  Highly detailed items where the experience can&#x27;t be handled by a smartphone pix.  There&#x27;s an outdoor sculpture museum in central Wisconsin thats pretty cool to experience.  Near the river, in Wausau?  Not all art is low res, or low res paintings.  I liked your link to the dots, that would be interesting to see.<p>My limited maker faire experience is its VERY art heavy, for certain specific styles of art.  Partnering with a stodgy old fashioned museum sounds like a winner.  Put some tents up on that unused temple-like grass lawn, get some people looking at all kinds of art, not just old or new stuff.<p>I am as mystified as op that the gift shop usually has nothing on topic.  I can buy a tour book of italy or a kids coloring book, but not a poster of my favorite painting.  Why not?  Thats an epic fail.  It would be like going to a food store that sells everything but food.<p>I feel most people don&#x27;t like art itself and only go to be seen as a patron.  Back in my dating days I took dates to several museums.  Its a cool date idea.  More interactive and interesting than a movie.  Lets be honest, I was paying more attention to my date than the art, that was kind of the point of taking a date to the museum.  I&#x27;ve been kicked out of museums early because a corporation rented the whole building for a christmas party or whatever, money talks, and I hope at least some of the employees looked at the art vs just eating at the buffet and getting drunk.  But this kind of social activity sets a very low bar for the &quot;art experience&quot;.  Its just an extremely nicely decorated social hall.<p>One failure in the article is $0 admission, in the &quot;urban&quot; areas, means homeless people living / sleeping in the museum, parents treating the facility like a free day care...  It&#x27;ll be just like the libraries problem.  More money and more guards can kind of fix this problem, but still...<p>The six second anecdote reminds me of the zoo or flea markets.  People will glance to be polite, but they don&#x27;t really care.  I spent a lot of money to drive a long way to see a traveling dutch masters painting exhibition maybe 20 years ago.  I think it was time and money well spent.  I admit I almost &quot;ran&quot; thru the rest of the museum, taking those six second glances, to get to what I wanted to see, and it was pretty cool.  So its not like &quot;six seconders&quot; don&#x27;t care about any art, they just don&#x27;t care about six second art.  What I wonder about is people who run the entire zoo, or entire museum, all at the six second pace.  Did they ever see anything they liked?  I run into people like this at parks and on trails too, if you&#x27;re not going to stop and look at anything, get out of the way and stay home and look at google street view.<p>The article has another failure, it fails to acknowledge that art can be leased.  The megacorp at work is in a semi-questionable urban area, so it has a 24x7 security guard, which is better than all but the best art museums can provide for their best pieces, so rent us a &quot;nice&quot; painting for our reception area please, maybe not the nicest most expensive, but ...  Technically our reception desk area is public and someone in the general public could walk up, look at our art, and walk out without the guard detaining or harassing them.  Better on our wall behind our guard on a long term lease in public than locked in a vault in private.  For enough money a service company could maintain a plastic box containing the art and its lighting every month, or week, or whatever.  For a very large amount of money they could provide a guard.  Maybe a startup idea here?",1431363832

9526174,comment,9522379,9522379,0,0,orthecreedence,,,"A lot of this comes down to confidence. How comfortable are you with yourself? A lot of our communication is non verbal. How slow and steady you talk. How your body opens up to or turns away from others. Do you lean in, or are you leaning away? Are your eyes bugging with excitement or are they half open and disinterested?<p>A lot of the people who &quot;talk smart&quot; are actually moving smart. Chin slightly up, shoulders back, arms uncrossed, slightly leaning back. This all projects confidence, and if you are exuding confidence, people listen to you. That&#x27;s assuming you have something interesting to say =].<p>Another thing you can do to project confidence is to <i>actually be confident.</i> This is earned by accomplishing hard things in your life, and putting in a lot of spiritual work to be happy with who you are as a person. You can lean back and hold your head up as much as you want, but if you&#x27;re insecure or unsure of yourself, you will come across as a phony.<p>Be the person you want to be. Be the person who is exactly where you are supposed to be <i>right now</i> both in mind and spirit. Confidence will follow. And so will conversation.<p>Another thing you can do is to just be a great listener. Don&#x27;t just wait for your chance to speak. If you have a <i>really great point</i> you want to bring up but the conversation diverges, take a breath, and let it go. Slow your mind and be present.<p>Charm and wit take practice. So if you want to be good, go to a lot of parties with different types of people and talk to everyone you can. Practice, practice, practice. Nobody ever got good at this stuff by sitting at home listening to podcasts. Get out there are start conversations with people. Learn to intuit people&#x27;s moods. Is this person sad? Maybe they lost someone recently. Talk about loss. Relate to them. Is this person happy? Bring up a cool experience you had and see if they&#x27;ll share one they had. This kind of intuition comes from practice, from learning to read bodies and faces and moods.<p>Keep in mind I&#x27;m not an expert, but as an introvert I&#x27;ve been working on all this for a long, long time.<p>Good luck =].",1431363811

For this $10 per month, you have the right to read all of the news posted on the website.<p>The website allows individual freelance writers to put their articles on it.<p>Now here's the catch - the $10/month that each user pays actually gets distributed <i>by that user</i> to writers whose articles he appreciates. So everytime he reads an exceptionally good article, he gets to assign some of his $10 to that article, as much as he wants.<p>At the end of the month, whether he assigns the money or not, he loses the 10 bucks. If he assigned all $10 to writers, that's fine. If he left some over, that goes to the website and is used to pay for editors, servers, hackers, etc.<p>This creates a situation where people are paying for aggregated content (you'd have a plethora of social networking, commenting, and rating systems tailored in whatever way is determined to be optimal) and the writers who are most appreciated by the readers are getting paid.<p>At the same time, the readers get to try out as much writing as they want for free, so stuff is NOT hidden behind a paywall. They can read the article first and if they find it useful to them can award their dollars. If not, they don't. This encourages quality and also encourages a wide readership.<p>Anyway I would totally pay $10/month for a system like this. I think you would actually see the case that many people would voluntarily choose to pay more than $10/month just so they can contribute more to their favourite authors.

982918,comment,981323,982846,0,0,horseass,,,"Good point. Evolution has replication at its core so perhaps is better for creating artificial <i>life</i> rather than specifically searching for brain designs (there'd have to be a lot of intelligent design to select brains anyway since evolution doesn't 'want' to go in any particular direction by default other than successful replication). Even though it can't forsee or jump, evolution's mass search power might outweigh these pitfalls (its the only known algorithm so far to have proven being able to build something as complex as a human brain.. though there's all sorts of bundled 'non-brain' stuff like arms, reproduction, kidneys, etc. included, which engineering could presumably ignore). This video shows 2 'wheels' of sorts in nature (but of course living things are full of mandelbroit 'roughness' and have compromises and such, instead of evolving perfectly engineered wheels):<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmLS2WXZQxU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmLS2WXZQxU</a><p>Those are obvious rare exceptions though, and evolution never built something as fast as a jet etc. and plenty of other stuff that would need foresight. Not sure if there is some sort of somewhat simple engineering principle behind brains/consciousness that we just havn't figured out yet, but if we knew it, maybe we could engineer it like a jet instead of using evolution. A jet seems extremely simple relative to just about any of nature's locomotion creation though.<p>For the comment below, interesting fractal 'amplification' idea.

I was one of the early adopters who paid 600 bucks for an iPhone, so I don't consider that terribly overpriced.<p>But $499.00 for a product from an unknown entity like Fusion Garage? eh. from what I've seen of them so far, they don't have Apple's flair for design. So now it's more of a stretch. They'll get some sales from gadget-happy early adopters, but it's going to take a whole lot of feel-good word-of-mouth reporting in the blogosphere before it will hit the mainstream.",1260241718

Ergo, the lack of legal documents is primary evidence that there was no contractual agreement.<p>It's actually quite possible that Michael never raised any money, never invested anything significant into Fusion Garage, and therefore really doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.<p>Saying that you ""Worked together on an idea"" and ""Collaborated on a system"" - is a lot different from having a contract wherein Arrington invested $500K into the project, and got a clear assignment of intellectual property.<p>It will be interesting to see if he files suit against fusion garage.<p>Meanwhile - why by JooJoo when I have to believe for $300 more you'll be able to get a MacTablet is what I'm thinking...",1260241381

We haven't seen each other in 7+ years at this point, and weren't best friends back then. I've learned my lesson the not so hard way not to accept just anyone as a cofounder. Since neither of us have any background that can really be said to be 100% verifiable, how should I approach like a bailout, or trial period? I'm technical, and we're building software, he's financial, marketing, business, and grapic design. I'll be building the product myself. I realize the other stuff is as important, but how can I? should I? validate that he's going to cut it.<p>I myself feel I can be validated by having something to show after a few weeks to a month of work.",1260241314

Who trusts the media these days? According to Sacred Heart University's polling in 2007 19% of Americans implicitly trusted the mainstream media. Down 8% since 2003. More alarming is that 87% felt the mainstream media was trying to manipulate them. Polls and statistics may not actually prove anything but again let me ask: Who trusts the media these days? Do you know <i>anyone</i> who feels that way? Maybe the extreme ideologues who are simply looking for some rah-rah cheer leading action and don't actually care about truth or facts.<p>The point of delivering news that's important to readers is much more valid but still very flawed. You get much better results aggregating together content from different sources or, better yet, discovering content from people you have a personal relationship with. Friends, family, co-workers. That all becomes very difficult behind a pay-wall. In this era there are less mainstream sensibilities about news. Everyone has a different weird mix of news they want to see. If you're going for a personalized delivery system you absolutely need social networks, crowd sourcing, and free access so people can discover new topics of interest.<p>As for quality... He's assuming people can appreciate quality when compared to stories about music stars kissing each other or golf players crashing into tree's with their luxury SUVs. I don't believe for a second that quality matters to the vast majority of the mainstream news audience. The average news paper is written to be consumed by people who struggled through junior high school English class.",1260241244

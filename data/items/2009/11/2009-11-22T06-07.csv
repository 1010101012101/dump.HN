955499,comment,954835,954972,0,0,moe,,,"<i>a toned down, smooth voice of a person of the opposite sex is generally considered ""most pleasant""</i><p><i>IT is dominated by men, so a girl is a practical choice if you want to be successful.</i><p>That's actually not true. When you switch on the tube you will notice that most commercials (except those that are supposed to have women identify themselves with) are dominated by male voices. Being forced to use a female voice in an ad is usually considered a weakness because male voices are more effective in binding your attention and suggesting ""trust"".<p>Regardless I don't think all of this plays much of a role in a tech screencast. I agree that I want to understand the damn thing, so get a pleasant speaker (of any gender) and don't make me suffer. From there my decision for or against a product will be influenced by so many details, I doubt ""pleasant voice"" affects it much.",1258873150

There's no telling what breaking up any company that achieves 5% to 10% market share would do to capitalism, but it probably wouldn't be good. Would you bother trying to build the next Google if you knew it was just going to be split into 15 pieces if you succeeded? I would not.<p>It also says nothing two of the biggest problems our brand of capitalism faces, which are perverse incentives and lack of transparency, both of which were leading causes of the recent meltdown and our current health care woes.",1258871747

And I thought that before I knew he was an ultra-right-wing nutjob.<p>The problem with sci-fi and fantasy is that because they're so niche, and because so many people are predisposed to liking them based on subject area alone, the average successful writer makes even Dan Brown look like Charles Dickens. That makes Card look good by comparison because he isn't a bad writer (certainly far better than Brown) and most in the genre are.",1258871215

In a perfect market, profit margins represent value perceived.<p>If your product will save me 10$ but costs you 2$ to produce, charging 5$ is beneficial to both of us.<p>The problem we have now is that the current large companies believe that they're entitled to receiving the same profits they've had in the past without innovating or even adapting to the future.<p>If your value proposition is only worth 2$ to me in the future, why should the government come in and tax all companies in my industry because I don't think you're worth paying anymore?<p>I suppose that's a simplistic view but then again I've always abhorred working at large companies because of the huge number of people I'd see around me contributing very little. I think small companies will very often beat big ones on both quality AND cost because of the lack of bureaucratic overhead.

955474,comment,954273,955137,0,0,sigh400,,,"It's next to impossible to hustle someone in poker regardless. You can only misrepresent your skill for a very short period of time before the losses become too great to overcome. In most cases you'll never be able to setup a huge bet to recover those losses. (Especially with capped buy-ins of 100-200bb). Furthermore, since there is still the unknown factor like in the the old 5c-draw scenarios  -- you have a 4 of kind him a straight flush etc. you can bet everything and still lose regardless to how skilled you are.<p>Additionally, luck still plays a huge role in the short term no matter how skillful you are. You can't bluff/draw every hand and win over the long term. I can't lose to you for thousands of hands and then suddenly flip a switch and make it up in one hand. This is where/why the pool/golf/prop etc hustles work.<p>Poker is really about the long term unless you go on a short streak (such as perhaps Isil did) and get out. Otherwise the skill factor will eventually kick in; Even if it takes 1million+ hands before you can even start talking about the ""long term"" there is no real way to hustle anyone over that amount of hands. Poker wisdom is: ""The long term is REALLY REALLY long.""",1258870363

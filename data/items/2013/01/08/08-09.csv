I still use it as my default browser, but there are two quite simple features in Chrome that I'm really missing in Firefox:<p>1. Exemplary implementation of user accounts. I have a separate user account for my private Google account (Gmail, Calendar etc), a second for Facebook, a third for work (separate Twitter and Google accounts) and a third for web development. I know Firefox has a Profile manager and that it is possible to use -no-remote to run several profiles at once. But: it does not work very well at all. Not even with the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/profileswitcher/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/profileswitch...</a> addon.<p>2.

This is likely an even bigger concern in typically cramped bathrooms than the entry hallways.<p>Also, to the extent that stall walls/doors are often generic hardware, reused in many cramped spaces, having the doors open inward may give designers more confidence that the swinging of the door is not obstructed by local constraints. (Allocating the rectangle footprint for the stall ensures entry works, as opposed to allocating the rectangle-plus-outward-swinging-door-semicircle).<p>Another lesser consideration might be that an inward-swinging door makes occupancy by more than one person somewhat more difficult.",1357635152

Hereabouts being a professor is an all year job (with usual vacation times), with the two-fold task of doing research as well as doing teaching.<p>The time periods in which there are no classes are usually used by professors to focus more on their research and take their vacations (5 weeks per year like everyone else). Similarly, these time periods are not strictly holidays for students, with many students taking exams.<p>I've seen a few professors simply neglect their research and take the whole time period where they don't have classes as ""vacation"", but this seems to be limited to a few older professors who are still state employed, basically untouchable and seem to have lost their motivation over the years.

Sure, we agree. Are you saying this is some fundamental problem for Haskell? Because I'm trying to tell you it's not the case. For example, on that line a better practice would be to do exactly what your Python script did; label the reader with csvs with ""qualified"" in the import.<p>So let's refresh the comparison with the proper style and without the decision to convert to lists from vectors:<p><pre><code>    -- Haskell, cleaner but longer. \n    -- Many people prefer this style when dealing in IO.\n    -- Please note that 'readFile' here sucks nearly as\n    -- badly as your Python version's readfile does. \n    -- They are terrible.\n    f <- BS.readFile ""somefile.csv""\n    case CSV.decode True f of\n      Left  error  -> putStrLn error\n      Right tuples -> do \n         -- ...\n\n    # Python\n    with open(""nukes-list.csv"", 'rb') as f:\n      try: \n        csvfile = csv.reader(f)\n        # ...\n      except csv.Error as e:\n        print e\n      </code></pre>\nHuh. Similar linecount, similar line density.<p>You might argue, ""Why were all the extra fmaps there?"" Well, ostensibly they're there to do what your code doesn't do, namely deal with exception conditions (your code just ignores errors). But of course the author's poor style throws that benefit away on the same line with the pattern match on ""Right _"", but we've already conceded the author's code could be cleaner.<p>My point: You're blaming Haskell for the author's decisions. You're also crediting Python with your own personal familiarity. It is not Python that is natural and obvious, your many hours of hard work with Python have made that language's solution easy for you to perceive. Give yourself some credit, and stop pretending Python is somehow ""naturally' clearer.<p>If you'd like to see examples of good, clean, fast Haskell code then they're easy to provide. I have a funny feeling that's not your goal here, though.",1357634720

It allows the composition of a class implementation/interface from multiple other classes. Obviously composing code without using the provided language features for virtual dispatch can be more flexible, however inheritance has the advantage of being able to succinctly define types that are just parametrizations of other types.<p><pre><code>  class SortedList\n    cons(var key=(i) -> i)\n  \n  //Does it really matter if you write\n\n  class AgeOrderedPeople extends SortedList\n    key(person)\n      person.age\n\n  //or\n\n  AgeOrderedPeople = partiallyApply(SortedList, key=(person) -> person.age)\n</code></pre>\nwhen trying to parametrize behavior?<p>What's truly ironic is when people who blindly denounce inheritance then proceed to write things like<p><pre><code>  sorted_people = people.sort((p) -> p.age)\n</code></pre>\ninline, in 12 different places or slightly better<p><pre><code>  sorted_people = (people) -> people.sort((person) -> person.age)\n</code></pre>\nJava and C++ have their faults, but I'm not really sure what's wrong with C#, since it's probably the best designed of the current statically typed languages that have mainstream adoption. It has the right mix (if a little OO biased) of OOP and FP, awesome reflection (using a special type interface an AST can be captured at compile time from a lambda expression), a powerful generic system (covariant, contravariant, generic constraints, method type inference, works at the bytecode level), properties, local type inference, syntactic sugar for generators, syntactic sugar for limited continuations (essentially break methods in two, the request code and the response callback while coding it as if it were synchronous), and a fairly sane library.

211485,comment,211045,211318,0,0,gojomo,,,"Compared to the reinvigoration of browser competition and standards-compliance that the Mozilla project has achieved, this issue is a minor quibble. You can add Microsoft and many others with a few clicks.<p>Someone has got to be the default, and selling preferential placement means this project, an important counterbalance to MSFT, gets around 1/1000th the revenue of MSFT.<p>Let MSFT outbid Google for the top spot if they want. MSFT doesn't need anyone's charity.",1212831342

Sure, I can read code, but only ""command by command"", it is hard to see the big picture - for me, anyway.<p>I think math notation evolved over centuries, too. That's not a proof that it could not be improved upon, but I remain sceptic.<p>What will be next, musical notation? OK, admittedly<p>play_c play_d play_e play_f# is more readable than musical notes in a way (namely, if you can't read notes), but I bet that if you want to actually play the notes with an instrument, you might eventually prefer the classical notation. Although for music, there are alternative notations that make sense in special cases. Maybe for maths it will be the same.<p>Anyway, anybody who writes a maths paper is free to choose the representation they want.",1212831178

Its the database which is the real scaling problem.",1212830989

211479,comment,211236,211450,0,0,walterk,,,"No, it's not the same.  Taleb points to the ""envelope of serendipity"" to emphasize just how important the element of chance really is.  I.e., you can't discount even the ""chanciest"" of chance events.  That emphasis is lost in your translation.<p>Also, I didn't mean to call your interpretation stupid...rather, that you're interpretation assumes a sort of stupidity on behalf of the speaker.",1212830933

211475,comment,211461,211461,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, the interesting thing, to me, is that a few weeks ago everyone was discussing the axing of Blaine Cook from the Twitter team for his ""failure to scale"".  Turns out, nobody else in the company can scale Twitter or keep it online reliably, either.  Huh.  Must be a hard problem.  It's probably a good time for folks to apologize to Blaine for piling all the blame on one guy for a problem that, in reality, took the whole development team to create and will take the whole development team to solve.  (And it's time for everyone to stop pretending scaling can be solved by one magic bullet or another...if you don't build, or rebuild, to scale, you won't scale.)",1212829465

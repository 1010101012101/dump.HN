For the purposes of productivity enhancement, I think kratom and coffee are best consumed during a day as slowly as possible... if you feel yourself getting tired or distracted, take a sip. <p>I don't feel that kratom use hinders higher intellectual function in sub-opiating doses but this is difficult to measure.<p>There is only one good pharmaceutical solution for suppressing tiredness without other side effects: Modafinil. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil</a> This is an account of extreme Modafinil use and abuse. <a href=""http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=45423"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=45423</a>",1197200570

87452,comment,87392,87447,0,0,yters,,,"So, are you a major user yourself?  Even caffeine, which I use out of weakness and necessity, I worry about.  Subjectively, it seems like my increased focus and lack of tiredness comes at a cost to my higher intellectual functions.  No objective proof of this, though subjectivity counts for something.<p>Has anyone here achieved good enough control over their body where they don't need this stuff?  Have you found a significant difference between operating on and off drugs when going without sleep for long periods?",1197199275

Delaware is good for tax.<p>You can do this easily online. Should be $US200-500.<p>Have a small amount of shares at first. You can change this later. I forget why. <p>google delaware site:news.yc.com for more info.<p>If you live outside the US, get a a US postal forwarder. Also handy for the USPTO and getting Apple products without being priced gouged (eg, if you live in Australia or the UK).",1197198557

If you plan to scale, I would recommend having seperate Xen slices for your web, app, and database components. It was a life saver to be able to just move your database and app servers to seperate boxes when we needed to scale out.<p>Memory is critical. Yes, Rails is a little slow but application servers are trivial to scale. The database is virtually always going to be the hard bottle neck so you're going to want plenty of memory.",1197198199

Everything works out of the box at the end of the install with zero setup required. <p>Compiz, webcam, touch sensitive multimedia keys, wireless, bluetooth, touch slider on trackpad, multimedia card reader, and all the usual bits and pieces.<p>They're also great looking, and have won a Red Dot award to prove it.",1197198085

JSON is quicker to serialize to and from than XML, and it also uses less bandwidth.<p>Realistically though, the serialization should be a simple layer on the top of your API, and there isn't anything that should prevent you from doing both quickly.",1197198014

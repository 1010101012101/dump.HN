Be honest and don&#x27;t ask for personal names at all. Ask for billing information.<p>The &quot;name&quot; fields in billing forms are not personal names.

Obviously, every death is a terrible loss, but this forum is fond of numbers, so while we&#x27;re on the subject, here are some numbers:<p>The total number of deaths in the entire Israeli-Arab conflict over the past 70 years or so, is - according to Wikipedia - under 100,000. Out of which, about 25,000 are Israeli, a similar number are Palestinians, and the rest, I guess are casualties of all the other fighting arab countries combined, although the total seems to me a bit high. That&#x27;s the total for the past 70 years.<p>By comparison, in the Libyan and Syrian civil wars, Wikipedia puts the number of deaths at about 30,000 in each country in the last year alone. And the Mexican drug war has claimed the lives of about 56,000 since 2006; some estimates go as high as 100,000.<p>So, not to compare suffering, but the entire Israeli-Arab conflict has claimed, over the last 70 years, more or less the same number of lives as the drug war in Mexico in the past 6.</i><p>In short, both sides are trying to recruit the world&#x27;s support for what is, in reality, a very low-intensity conflict compared to just about any other violent conflict, anywhere else in the world.",1404863067

At the very least it&#x27;s hard to see how any industrial production could be made immune to strikes and sabotage, if the workers were desperate enough -- and that would likely result in a transfer of wealth (by no means is a &quot;fair&quot; outcome guaranteed, but change seems very likely).<p>I think it is too early to conclude that the revolution will never arrive.

8007322,comment,7998609,8002843,2,0,Gravityloss,,,"I&#x27;m just a rocket enthusiast, my day job (or jobs) are unrelated to the field. I&#x27;ve been following and participating in the Newspace movement for about ten years. The scene was really vibrant around 2004-2010 with multiple vertical hovering rocket companies / teams. I&#x27;ve learned a lot about discussions on various lists, newsgroups and forums. Besides of course just knowing the basic physics from college.<p>There have been lots of old space enthusiasts and professionals who have been patiently teaching others. You can get a small taste here:\n<a href=""http://yarchive.net/space/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yarchive.net/space/index.html</a>\nIf you corrected Henry Spencer on a technical matter, rumor is you got a T-shirt.<p>Unfortunately those small companies did not scale up as envisioned, at least have not so far. Masten Space flew their Xaero vehicle 110 times, always landing vertically, before it crashed on the 111th flight. They know their stuff. (They continue flying other vehicles and are building new ones.) It&#x27;s just hard to make money with that.<p>But then SpaceX took the torch and started taking reusability seriously (at the start they were talking about recovering and refurbishing stages from the ocean, not a good strategy), and we might finally see some real VTVL first stages on orbital rockets. It&#x27;s at least one dream come true. Rockets landing on their tail, on a pillar of flames, &quot;like God and Heinlein intended&quot;.<p>Danielle: I&#x27;m reminded by your quote that went roughly as follows: what Lightsail is trying to do with energy storage could have been done hundreds of years ago as the technology is not that complicated. \nIt feels like that with rocketry as well. There are no fundamental physical barriers to cheaper reusable rockets, as the components have existed since the late sixties. It&#x27;s just that there have been no coherent, funded, methodical attempts. Until now. It is of course vastly easier now than in the seventies, because of carbon fiber, GPS, fiber gyros, computers, CFD and CNC.\nThere&#x27;s a need for a SpaceX competitor. And there&#x27;s probably room in the market. The DC-8 to the 707. And just in case something happens. It looks like the old players, &quot;Dinospace&quot;, (ULA, Arianespace, Russian companies, China, Japan, India) are not even trying.<p>The Newspace scene has had very coherent visions and great spirit. Move fast and break things. Lots of iterations, at small scale. Competitors sharing knowledge. Many of those people have moved on from rocket building to consulting, to satellites, government work for future asteroid missions, or to completely other sectors. I hope they can influence the space sector in their part.<p>I am very hopeful that NASA can adjust and reach new heights if the space launch prices drop a lot. Their deputy administrator Lori Garver &quot;gets&quot; Newspace. If there&#x27;s something great that you can get off the shelf cheaply - use it!",1404862436

Only in this community do you increase in investment size by 200% over a 4 year period and still see people questioning whether your market is becoming more viable.  New York&#x27;s investment share is apparently more than 1/4 that of Silicon Valley and climbing.  That&#x27;s a big deal for a city that was once seen as tied exclusively to old money.<p>&quot;The amount of venture, angel and private equity money invested in New York soared about 200 percent from 2009 to 2013, to $3 billion from $799 million, according to CB Insights, a data analysis firm that specializes in venture capital trends. Silicon Valley, by contrast, took in $11.4 billion in 2013.&quot;",1398678866

7659019,comment,7658551,7658551,31,0,netcan,,,"There&#x27;s an appealing idea that the core of human intelligence is one general purpose algorithm. I like thinking that there is something fundamental, simple and elegant waiting to be discovered like evolution by natural selection or Newtons laws (of mechanics).<p>A beautiful thing about Evolution by Natural Selection is that the principle itself is metaphysical, not physical. It exists in the same realm as math or logic. The principle is embodied in biology just like the concept of a square can be embodied as a planet. Even if we didn&#x27;t have any  physical squares our metaphysical ideas about metaphysical squares would still valid, hence n-dimensional geometry.<p>Another cool thing about Evolution by Natural Selection is that it is nicely self contained. It&#x27;s the bottom of a finite rabbit hole. Understanding what evolution is made of will help us understand a particular instance of evolution, but not the principle. So, knowing about DNA and genetic mutations helps us understand evolution in biology but it doesn&#x27;t tell us more about evolution in abstract. IE, it doesn&#x27;t get us to a more fundamental understanding. Even if Darwin had been wrong about the origin of species he would still have discovered something awesome.<p>Newtons principles have a different kind of elegance. They are extremely fundamental and a pleasingly small number of them are needed. The difference is that they are very much <i>physical</i> laws. They are fundamental enough to be treated as fundamental rules of the universe. Almost. Newtonic physics still leaves open the idea of more fundamental questions and answers. Learning what gravity is <i>made of</i> does get us closer to the fundamental.<p>Darwin&#x27;s evolution is fundamental in the way that math is. Newton&#x27;s mechanics is fundamental in the way that atoms are. The way I have these defined in my own mind is <i>Philosophical</i> and <i>Scientific.</i> It&#x27;s a sort of fuzzy distinction and it breaks down a lot. But it seems useful to me sometimes. &quot;Anthropic,&quot; for example, is something you need to get your philosophical mind familiar with.<p>Back to AI. The single algorithm idea hints, I think a &quot;philosophical&quot; explanation. We&#x27;re looking for some metaphysical property of the universe that intelligence is an instance of.",1398678809

7658984,comment,7657899,7657899,1,0,akiselev,,,"I&#x27;ve seen a lot of friends have a lot of trouble with hobbyists 3d printer but I had a Stratasys Dimension Elite (on the higher end of filament based 3D printers) and it was significantly easier to use. At like 20x the cost of a MakerBot it&#x27;s only justifiable if you consistently use it for prototyping and  proprietary printers are tuned to a specific plastic so using their cartridges with cheaper plastic usually yields worse results (so, hack a cartridge eeprom + onboard computer and deal with shitty prints or pay $200+ per spool on top of the up front cost).<p>With a double print head, it extruded a support filament which made it very easy to print complex shapes (with everything cleaned and carefully set up even a good mobius net is possible) with any plastic. The support filament dissolved afterward in an ultrasonic bath filled with some basic chemical that also smoothed out the parts after printing. The cartridges made it much easier to work with spools but was very wasteful since any time you switched you&#x27;d lose a bit.<p>If you&#x27;re going to build a 3d printer however, the stuff that Stratasys does seems to really help: the print envelope is sealed and uses a bunch of fans and heating elements to keep the temperature well above ambient (I don&#x27;t remember the exact number but it was easily 110+ F) as well as heat the printing platform. The z-axis is on a ball screw independent of the XY axes which, although expensive (as usual, look to ebay), helps with the reliability. The print head would print several layers (dozens usually) and then go over to a metal wire brush to wipe off any remaining plastic from the extruder.<p>All in all it was a well built machine but way too expensive with several large electronic boards (including an Intel mobo running Fedora or something) and a lot of wasted space and metal. The heated envelope, ball screw, and support material made a huge difference but in the end the results were only so useful due to material limitations and terrible tolerances (I would usually print the same part half a dozen times or more in order to get one with the right dimensions to fit in a more precise metal part if they mated in several places or in an irregular way)",1398677749

There are no fundamentally fixed moral rights relating to trade because there is no universal objective notion of property. Property is an entirely social concept and can only exist through social contract. You only &quot;own&quot; an object to the extent that everyone else agrees you do.<p>Most people want there to be regulation of business, even if some of it is corrupt and inefficient. Most people want governments to collect taxes and control shared resources, even if this is inefficient and wasteful. These things are seen as a necessary evil. If it&#x27;s what the public want, then it&#x27;s not immoral, because the entire notion of property (and by extension trade) only exists as a social contract.\nTo go into detail for your taxi example, the roads were built as part of a social contract where people pay taxes under the expectation that the government will execute some form of transport policy. Tax payers would have anticipated some form of taxi regulation to occur over future roads. For most people this is desirable because they want to be protected as consumers. If you take away taxi regulation, then you are not honouring the implicit contract that allowed for the creation of the roads.<p>You may personally disagree with this widespread desire for regulation. It is also reasonable to say that corrupt and inefficient regulation is immoral. However I think it is quite dangerous to argue that regulation itself is fundamentally immoral.

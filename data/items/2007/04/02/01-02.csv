8097,comment,8095,8095,0,0,anil,,,"I have been working with Distributeds for a while .. ever since the RPC, the arrival of Java RMI , CORBA DCOM and now .NET. I dont know but for some reason I like working with .NET a lot more than I would have liked working with JAVA's RMI. I admit its been a while since I worked with RMI in java but I dont think it still matches up with the lease manager idea in .NET. anyone care to comment on that?",1175478716

That way you know if you ever have to re-do the ownership at any point, you might not get exactly what you want but you will still get something very close to fair.<p>",1175477272

This probably won't help your mother, but if you're worried about coming down with alzheimer's yourself you might look into it.<p>A lot of people in my family unfortunately got this disease. I don't know of anything that can reverse its course and I've looked. There are some drugs that are supposed to help a bit but no silver bullet. Google is your friend here (can't recall what they're called, but there are ads for them in all the psychiatric trade journals.)<p>So much for the wonders of science.<p>I further suggest you might join an alzheimer's support network to see how other people cope with a loved one that has this. I'm sorry to say, in my experience, alzheimer's can almost be harder on the caregiver than on the afflicted. So your top priority should be taking care of yourself, so that when you are around your mom you can give her the love and affection she needs and be tolerant of her lapses.",1197933640
90482,comment,90427,90427,0,0,Tichy,,,"I recently read the book ""Super Crunchers"", which mentioned a medical database called Isabel. By googling I just found this link: <a href=""http://www.openclinical.org/aisp_isabel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openclinical.org/aisp_isabel.html</a><p>I think it is a kind of AI that seeks to extract medical knowledge from published medical research. So I think it is not just a search engine that would point you into the middle of incomprehensible scientific papers, it somehow helps you with diagnosis and treatments. (I haven't tried it myself)<p>Not sure how good it is, but as far as I have read, it is definitely a valid concern that individual doctors might not know about the latest research (where ""latest"" can actually be years and even decades).  There was also recently another post on news.yc about the ""Checklist"", which might go into a similar vein: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=87167"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=87167</a>",1197933201

90476,comment,90387,90460,0,0,akkartik,,,"That's a valid point.<p>But there's value in studying things that didn't work. A huge number of obvious approaches to AI have been tried already, and the insights on why they don't work, or why they work on this problem but not this other one, are often the result of huge quantities of time spent on subtle traps and dead ends. To ignore them risks wasting your time all over again.<p>I think AI boils down to just the problem of managing complexity that all of cs is about. The eventual solution will be vast, and will require designing lots of separate subsystems that work in very different ways and yet need to communicate in subtle ways.<p>That emphasis on scale goes for research in general, I think. I recommend this video of Malcolm Gladwell talking about the nature of genius and how it's changed over the years.\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/gladwell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/gladwe...</a>\nHe compares the decoding of the rosetta stone and linear B 40 years ago with Andrew Wiles proving Fermat's last theorem in the past decade, and how fundamentally different their respective approaches are.<p>Both approaches may work, but you have to decide what <i>attitude</i> you want to take. You can either try to be a single monster-mind like Ramanujam sweeping through vast areas of research, or you can assume that won't happen and resign yourself to a lot of effort and learning before you're able to synthesize something useful.<p><i>To summarize</i>: I agree that you want to avoid cluttering your mind with the ideology of past approaches. There's huge value though in simply studying the episodic history of a field, to be aware of what has been tried, what worked and what didn't.",1197932604

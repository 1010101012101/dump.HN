By forcing yourself to redo the basics, you get fresh insight on a level that someone new to whatever activity simply can't appreciate because they don't have X years experience with which to consider things.</i><p>I'm not sure it works that way. I'm very good at one or two things myself, but I don't really find that any additional knowledge now cames to me from explaining the basics to newcomers.<p>Rather, it's one of these (depending on the person):<p>1) when you become really good, you realise how much you still don't know, so you don't find it insulting of hilarious that other people don't know even the basis...<p>2) people motivated and devoted enough to get really good don't really care for the politics and the elitism anyway. They just care about the subject matter, and have no problem  explaining it to a newb (and some love their field so much, you can't get them to STOP explaining it!).",1355576103

Only when one is famous do others hear about those controversial views. Furthermore, just about every famous project has its distractors, leading to controversy.<p>Take Stephen Hawking as an example. He doesn't believe there was a god who created the universe. That's a controversial view to many. But when an non-famous atheist says exactly the same thing, few take notice, so you don't hear about those people.<p>Take Alan Kay as another example. He's one of the key people behind OLPC, which given its criticism could be considered controversial. But name any big project which has neither criticism nor controversy.<p>Ole Kirk Christiansen founded Lego. He was visionary in that he saw a future in plastic bricks as toys for children. What were his controversial views? I have no clue. But he probably had some. Perhaps his motto ""Only the Best is Good Enough"" is controversial to someone who believes that that second best may be good enough for some cases.",1355575167

But underneath there is a very elegant functional programming language. Who needs more built-in functions? Most scripting languages' built-in functions are just libraries written in that very language anyway. There's tons of such libraries for JavaScript.<p>A lot of the recent hype is due to node.js, too. Node.js is (somewhat simplified) a set of evented IO bindings for the V8 JavaScript engine. Those bindings enable us to build webservers using JavaScript. JavaScript was designed to be run in an event loop without any concurrency or blocking, which makes it incredibly easy to build software the scales reasonably well.<p>That said, I do agree that you should be able to use more languages in the browser. IIRC somebody has already ported Mono to Firefox which allows you to run tons of scripting languages in the browser. The next thing we need is standardization.",1285523425

Every change is costly, and your coding competitors won't have to eat those same costs.<p>Practically, one way to do that is to go sell a product that doesn't exist. And I mean sell it, not just get feedback. Get an actual contract from the customer and their buyin to help you build out the concept.<p>Build a high ticket item- this probably means a b to b product. You need as much skin in the game from your first customer as you can get and cheap products wont get it done.<p>Getting this contract is difficult, and the people i know who've taken this route admit that their first contract had hole a mile wide that allowed their customer to walk at any time. But, it sets the scene for collaboration and puts some psychological incentive out there to help keep everyone interested.<p>Only after you've sold your first customer do you then hire coders. Since your money will be somewhat fictitious at this point, you may have to look for a founderish type of coder, but thats ok. It will be bucket loads easier (and cheaper in terms of equity) to find one with a contract in hand.<p>I know someone who's done this twice, and both times, he achieved huge exits without outside substantial outside funding. The products were boring, but the businesses were outstanding.",1285521195

He describes the method of installing DroidWall as being beyond the grasp of most users.  I would go further and say expecting most (non technical) users to pay attention to, let alone understand, all the security permissions is a stretch.<p>Comparing Android to Windows in terms of it's security vulnerabilities?  There are some fair comparisons, but the better comparison is how it is more likely to become a platform littered with unwanted apps from carriers and third parties.  I wouldn't be surprised at some point to see Apps the ""bundle"" other apps.<p>People don't pay attention to all the words that flash on their screen before an app is installed.  They just want the app.<p>Having a better managed app store would be a big step in the right direction.<p>As for disabling net access for ""free"" games that you want to play so that they don't display ads, the current focus on free and $0.99 apps really leaves the developers who put time in little other recourse to make money.  (I'm not saying all free/cheap apps are of the same caliber, some are great and some are ""not scottish"").",1285520963

Don't do it for a ""real"" client - i.e. a client who has the money but is a cheapskate. They are the worst clients, the demanding, parasitic bottom feeders you find on the Craigslist ads everyone makes fun of. Do it for someone you know who could do with the help.<p>After a few of these you have a portfolio. This puts you in a position for paid work. However, your best bet is to first work for a professional web dev company - either as a contractor or full/part-time employee or intern. You'll learn best practices from experienced professionals. It's hard to really learn the trade on your own.<p>Second, doing freelance web development or design for client s, while good for practice, isn't really scalable - you might get to re-use some designs and code, but most of the time it's doing the same work over and over. Better to build an application that you can resell to many clients. For example, if you do a booking application for a hotel, think of how you can generalize it to sell to lots of hotels.",1285520727

One of the reasons why JavaScript is frequently misunderstood is because if you search for anything JS related you will find posts explaining how to do some DHTML thing in IE5/6 and Netscape.<p>It's great that Mozilla considers themselves to be the patron saints of JS, but much of the recent growth in the JS community is due to projects like V8 and node. Why doesn't Joyent or Google get to host the docs on their servers?<p>Perhaps it's a better idea to establish a Javascript Foundation that runs javascript.org or something.

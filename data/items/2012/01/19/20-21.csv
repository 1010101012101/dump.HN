3486670,comment,3484164,3484905,2,0,roguecoder,,,"Exactly.  Jury nullification is a long-standing (and some argue necessary) part of democratic systems of justice.  Basically, if laws are stupid and imposed on us by powerful people, juries should just refuse to enforce them.<p>It is too bad this has fallen by the wayside.  In general I think ""it's the law"" is a terrible reason to do anything: all it really does is shift the cost curves.  Businesses routinely break the law when the fine is less than the money they make, but if regular people do the same thing suddenly it's Eeeevil.",1327006794

Secondly, as far as I understand the DMCA, it doesn't even require you to go to these lengths.<p>Of course, I might be totally off base and they might really have kept the very same file in place and just removed a link to it on some pages while keeping the link on others.<p>Does anyone know more details about this?",1327006751

It looks to be more closely aligned with if people know how to execute or how much experience they have with doing so, taking and processing information. Personally, I'm not good processing information and acting on it quickly - some of it, sure, but it takes time for certain types of information to sit.

The key here is having access to the right people, so that you don't have to ""look"" for the right people.<p>I think that in this case what determines your ability to recruit the best people comes from your ""Network reach"" which varies from person to person, but is something that must be cultivated as diligently as technical knowledge or business knowledge, by maintaing the right relationships, associating yourself with the right communities and groups, connecting people with each other, and carefully training yourself to recognize and maximize opportunity when it arises.",1327006517

The fact is that the format underneath should be ePub3 with extras. ePub3 (with various extras) is and be available on various platforms.<p>For a traditional publisher to switch to a digital/interactive workflow is a lot of hard-core changes. Target platform and the part of the workflow Apple has has announced is - probably - not that big. They will have a lot more issues around decided the type of content to migrate, kinds of assets/widgets to use, information design of an interactive eBook, firing the track driver company, etc.<p>If somebody later provides a good alternative technological solution, the change required would be on the last 20% of the production pipeline. And several companies tried to provide a solution earlier, they just did not catch on because they did not have enough of a pieces to make it compelling (enTourage eDGe anyone?).<p>Of course, in a meanwhile, Apple will massively benefit from the early bird factor and may create de-facto lock-in by just being the first to actually offer a good solution (which includes democratization of the publishing tools by making the Author application free). This was the payoff of all the costs that went into making iPhone, the developers went to it, therefore the iPad already had huge momentum behind it from day one. Now Author builds on iPad's momentum.<p>But that's different from a real lock-in, such as Windows (temporarily) not sharing the details on how to make a browser to be default and making IE browser a default for all web-related stuff.

They had various communication issues, but one of the underlying complaints of my father was that my brother didn't understand the seriousness of being in business.  He would say, ""His nuts aren't in the ringer.""<p>I don't think piracy ruins businesses.  However, I don't think that anyone can make the argument that they ethically have the right to disregard the producer's terms for consuming their product, regardless of the form the product is in or how unreasonable those terms are.  The creator of the product has the right to define their terms and if you violate his/her terms, it's a transgression.  It's not a favor, a lesson, or a statement, you're taking without honoring their work in the way they've decided.  Maybe it will turn out great for them in the end, maybe not- it doesn't matter, they set the terms and you violated them.<p>Piracy is parasitic, not productive, and everyone loses.  We get these stupid censorship bills rolling through and resources are spent in trying to control the phenomena instead of innovating and addressing real issues.<p>Regarding Minecraft-- I did not realize that it was successful because it was pirated.

Hardcore emacs users never quite understood the appeal of a modal editor; hardcore vi users couldn't quite understand how people lived with an input model that constantly moved their fingers off home row.<p>Usability preferences can differ greatly by person. Another example is information retrieval in a personal database or help system. Some people prefer going through a search engine; others find a directory-based approach more intuitive (and forcing one approach on the other group does not improve productivity).<p>Similarly, having a unified set of tools for all kinds of version control problems is not necessarily an unalloyed good for everyone. Dealing with persistent history does not necessarily warrant the same approach as dealing with work-in-progress changes. For some users, it may be easier and better to consolidate both problems, for others, it can be more productive to keep them separate.<p>The Mercurial designers, for better or worse, have decided to separate persistent history changes from local work-in-progress changes, the latter being done via Mercurial Queues. That has the disadvantage that you need to learn a separate set of tools; it has the advantage that unfinished stuff does not pollute your repository's history and that you can tailor both sets of tools to their respective needs (whether they are in fact properly tailored is a different debate).<p>I suspect that, similarly, Bzr's one-directory-per-branch approach (inherited from Arch) is an easier mental model for some users to deal with than either git's or Mercurial's DAG-based approach, despite many git and Mercurial users not understanding the appeal.<p>Incidentally, both examples that you list (git stash and git commit --amend) are easily handled by Mercurial Queues.

It's hard enough for a human to figure out the right thing to say to a child, let alone design an algorithm to do that.  When I read Stephenson's book I thought that good speech generation was a much smaller problem to overcome (Indeed, it was dropped for the version of the Primer given to the cast-off girls) than content generation.  I remember feeling that, were the Primer built today, the on-demand talent required would be guided improvisational interaction rather than mere acting.<p>However, I could see a Watson like search engine being a possible alternative.  The child could carry around a monitoring device that would seed the search with the events of the child's day.  If the child struggles in class, gets beat up by a bully, etc. the engine could then set programming from an existing library of stories, movies, etc. that is immediately relevant to what the child is experiencing.  Entertainment for children is often designed to teach lessons.  This would just time the lessons to have maximum impact.  Teaching children is a bit like training dogs in that timing is massively important.  Catch a dog in the act of peeing on the rug and you can have a far greater impact than if you don't notice the mess until after it's dried!<p>AI cannot presently compete with humans when it comes to content generation, but the above device could be with a child night and day throughout their schooling, which is something few, if any, parents can do.",1327005070

It makes sense why they are that way, though. In order to become technically brilliant, they had to log many hours in front of a computer screen to practice and get good. Those hours spent programming didn't go into sports, theater, public debate, or whatever other activity might have built up their social skills.<p>The clincher for a lot of these technically brilliant people, from what I've observed, is that they start to feel superior to others because they are so smart/talented. They then begin to feel like the whole ""smooth thing"" is a waste of time, because we should just be able to compute our relationships with each other. (That may sound like I'm being sarcastic, but that is not my intention).<p>It's kind of the old story about ""book smart but not street wise"". There is a lot of value in learning how to make others feel comfortable around you, or to being able to work smoothly through challenging situations.<p>I'm thinking of the kind of situation where everyone in the room is tense and somebody is able to defuse the feeling. Being able to do that requires emotional intelligence, which is something many engineers don't always have in abundance.<p>Acquiring those abilities begins with seeing their value. If somebody who is socially awkward thinks it might be worthwhile to become less awkward, they can definitely do it. (I am speaking from personal experience here!)",1327004963

It's more comfortable to hold, you can make the text bigger, and you don't have to move it around when you change pages (related: <a href=""http://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/13/the-pursuit-of-laziness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/13/the-pursuit-of-laziness/</a>).<p>So then I hear people say things along the lines of ""Sure ebooks have their advantages, but a physical book just <i>feels</i> better"". They often make it sound like everybody either agrees with them or is indifferent, but this isn't the case.<p>Ebooks are cheaper to distribute than physical books. They are easier to carry around (thanks to the Kindle synchronization service, I _always_ have my book with me, because I always have my phone). The barrier to entry is lower, so we get to see books that wouldn't have, otherwise. Sure, a lot of it's crap, but most of everything is. We get some good stuff, too. The increased convenience and available gets many people (myself included) to read more. Moreover, some people, like me, just like it better.<p>Then I hear people say that the impending supremacy (in the sense of popularity) of ebooks over physical books is a catastrophe?<p><i>What?</i><p>More people are going to read more books, more often, more easily, and this is a <i>tragedy</i>? Really? How is this not excellent? How is this not wonderful?<p>Besides, physical books will still exist. LPs weren't killed by CDs, and they weren't even killed by digital music (although CDs might be, but nobody seems to care). Indeed, the fact that physical books will become a niche item probably means that they'll be higher quality (if more expensive) as people buy them for the binding, and not just for the book. Meanwhile, ebooks will enter the mainstream, and most people will be fine with them for most purposes. I'll wager dollars to donuts that the next generation won't really care.<p>The physical book is not dying. It's simply moving on to another stage of life. The <i>book</i> will be better off than it ever was.",1327004110

My favorite question every day to myself is ""If I was starting over today what would I do"". And Joe Kraus's ""Face reality"".<p>I found it impossible to do that during my YC interview though. From minute one it was a series of arrogant and condescending statements after another. Their ideas were nuggets of golden insight and my (far more educated in many instances) responses were dismissed out of hand.<p>I've had countless discussions of the same type with many other smart people (successful founders, investors, regular smart people) before and since. Some who raised far more difficult questions. I have reason to suspect the biggest problem was the YC partners and not some problem I have being flexible or thoughtful.<p>I think the essay as well as this quote are very revealing:<p><i>With the good groups, you can tell that everything you say is being looked at with fresh eyes and even if it's dismissed, it's because of some logical reason e.g. ""we already tried that"" or ""from speaking to our users that isn't what they'd like,"" etc. Those groups never have that glazed over look.</i><p>I think you're mistaking some founders ability to placate you with thoughtfulness in many, but certainly not all, cases.<p>One person who publicly talked about this phenomenon (in a joking way) was one of the founders of Heroku. He said that pg said ""You're an Oracle killer"" so he ""smiled and nodded because I wanted to get in"" (paraphrasing).<p>I think that's very indicative of the way many founders probably feel when talking to the YC partners. The ones who disregard that idea are likely marked as ""difficult to talk to.""<p>I think there's a very real danger you guys aren't hearing stuff like this because who in their right mind would tell you and who would you listen to? You would probably just say they're difficult to talk to.<p>The problem with being so damn smart (which all the YC partners truly are) is that you can start to think that any problem you run into (like founders who seem hard to talk to) you're assumption is that it's their fault instead of your own.<p>I do think there's some unbiased truth to the essay and maybe the founders who are good at placating will make better founders. But you have to consider: would Bill Gates or Steve Jobs really have smiled and nodded or would they have said ""What the hell are you talking about, that's stupid."" (We know what Jobs would have done anyway.)<p>I'm still a really big fan of YC and all the YC partners, but I do think you might have let some arrogance creep in to your process.

As soon as I switched to education and technical publishing (the <i>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</i>, started after YC), I was suddenly resourceful as all get-outand I started to feel unstoppable. I suspect that if I ever do YC again, the resourcefulness transformation will appear miraculous, not because of any change in my intrinsic resourcefulness, but because the new startup will be a much better fit for my interests and abilities.<p>One could argue that truly resourceful founders will iterate until they find a good fit.

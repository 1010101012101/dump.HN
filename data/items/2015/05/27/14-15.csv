9611661,comment,9609198,9611217,0,0,jacobr1,,,"> Why should we subject ourselves to it?<p>The traditional reason is to grant incentive for its creation in the first place. One primary example has been medical advances. With the benefit of a (temporary) monopoly on the sales of a new drug, the company has an incentive to create it in the first place. Perhaps we wouldn&#x27;t have as many life saving advances without IP protection. A secondary reason is that it requires public disclosure. One alternative to patent protection is to keep a production method a trade secret. So companies, if they are sufficiently secretive, could have effective if not legally enforced monopolies due to such secrets. So is it worth the tradeoff of having IP protection?<p>COST: a time-limited monopoly; limited incremental innovation on derivatives of the protected work during the lifetime of the protection.<p>BENEFIT: potentially more innovative goods and services are created to begin with; the means and methods behind these innovations are publicly documented for future replication or derivative work .<p>I&#x27;m think it is worth the tradeoff both for copyright protection and patents in general. But the specific laws are certainly not optimal as currently written and enforced by the courts. Durations for both patents and copyright are too long. Plenty of things that are patentable should not be, due to them being too obvious, trivial, or just not appropriate for protection.<p>Also the remedy for infringement has multiple options. You could allow general infringement, at statutory royalty rates. I think Canada has experimented with this for copyright, and the US as standard (but private) arrangements for the licensing of music. You could require a fraction of any profits. These provide the monopoly rents, but not a monopolization of production and derivatives. We are still learning what the optimal tradeoffs are for society. I hope we have more experimentation on regulatory regimes to identify the best compromises.",1432737656

You&#x27;ll become stupid. Remember those hard problems? The ones where you woke up early in the morning, excited to solve? Yeah, those. After a while, you won&#x27;t be able to solve them anymore. You&#x27;re out of practice. You can get the skill back, like any other skill, but it&#x27;s a scary feeling. And it makes the drudgery even worse.<p>2. Realize this is a business like any other and there are ways to use code to leverage for more cash.

Most developers shipping software definitely do not track security history for most of their components, and this is a huge opportunity.<p>Problem gets harder when people get things from outside package managers and vendor stuff though -- which does not help.<p>I owe Red Hat for a large part of the way I think about things, and I do think the world would be better if package managers were used more extensively for exactly the reason of tracking vendor security.  I also realize not everybody can package everything and do like to vendor deps (or similarly use language specific package managers often installed in arbitrary locations) or put them together <i>however</i> (random internet tarballs), and this ironically is why things like Docker also exist too.<p>The immutable systems movement is good, but something to clean up security practices would be a huge plus to avoid the comparisons to regression back to &quot;golden images&quot;. Using random base images vs distro base images makes it worse, but using stale distro images is itself a thing.",1432737037

You don&#x27;t want to do that because a large company has already done that for you and put it into a nice little package called an &quot;rpm&quot;. You take these RPMs and you find a simple way to unpack them on the filesystem, make a Docker image out of them, label/version them, and keep them in your Docker image hub. Now you have your RHEL patches as individual Docker images and can deploy them willy-nilly.<p>(This is, of course, exactly the same as maintenance on systems <i>without</i> Docker, and your dev & production environments would be the same with or without Docker, but Docker does make a handy wrapper for deploying and running individual instances with different dependencies)",1432736729

There is a bit of a difference in the USA though, where employers think you get productivity out of surveillance. We are not a very deeply thinking society, so it makes sense on the face of it that if you can see people working they are being productive. What we miss though, is that all the surveillance and lack of protections and benefits leads to massive amounts of squandered energies and effort on busy work. Busy work is work that is noise which serves a couple different types of purposes. It can make you look like you are working because you are working on something; whether it is relevant, important, or useful is totally irrelevant though. It can serve to make the system as inefficient as possible in order to assure job security. There are other purposes but those are some of the most prevalent.<p>At the core of the problem lies a misunderstanding of the problem that open plans are/were meant to address and can also be tied back to our problem with management models and incentives in our corporations and society.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated matter that I can&#x27;t do justice here, but if you have incompetent management trying to satisfy abusive demands from &quot;investors&quot; aka Wall Street, incompetent management leads to believe the problem of gaining ever more &quot;productivity&quot; out of a corporation and workers is solved by squeezing ever harder to get that last drop out. Which incompetent management and incentives lead them to believe can be done by putting everyone in a big open space so they feel surveilled and monitored and will do what they can to appear like a good worker by doing busy work and staying longer doing. This is largely all due to a system without employee protections where anyone in the 99% can be fired at a moment&#x27;s notice because some executive screwed up or needs to be paid more.<p>It&#x27;s more obviously presented as exercise metaphor, but the following post about &quot;Why Productive People Always have Time to Exercise&quot;<a href=""http://riskology.co/sharpen-the-saw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riskology.co/sharpen-the-saw/</a> also applies to these types of circumstances.<p>On a side note: Why the hell doesn&#x27;t HN support markdown?

PowerPoint is extremely powerful. Unfortunately, the one thing it &quot;needs&quot; the ability to do - train people how to use it effectively - isn&#x27;t really a core competency. Practically speaking, I don&#x27;t think instruction on how to use PowerPoint is genuinely possible, insofar as different business and cultural applications will have varying approaches and implementations.<p>The only thing that bothers me about PowerPoint, on a personal/professional level, is that it is so easy to use. Any semi-literate person with an ojbective and enough time on their hands can realistically create a deck. In a lot of ways, I see PowerPoint and Garageband as similar in this regard - sure, the software can help &quot;make&quot; a presentation or song, but will it be any good for an audience?<p>Basically, I think your first point is spot-on, and should be used as a buffer from undue criticism. In my professional experience, I&#x27;ve seen far too many &quot;experts&quot; in their fields try to tell me, the &quot;presentation expert&quot; what to do, how to do it, and be stupidly stubborn in fighting the collaborative process. To put it another way, many professionals talk trash about a liberal arts degree (such as creative writing) or the pursuit of experience in live performance (such as drama or comedy in front of audiences) until they realize that the highest stakes business situations are simply concentrated, higher pressure versions of those types of performances. It takes quite a while for a professional to get to a point in their career whereby they might have this epiphany, and those who do &quot;get it&quot; rise to the top in competitve opportunities. They understand the art of presentation, and they embrace guidance and support from artists (wordsmiths, graphic designers, etc) to achieve their vision.<p>My thesis topic for a Masters in Education (Curriculum Design) focused on the balance of technological tools versus internal intellectual development. Somewhat akin to the hypothesis of &quot;If I have this ubiquitious computer program that will correct my spelling / grammar for me, do I really need to know how to write well in the first place? No!&quot; From what I found in research / studies, yes, that appears to be the trend.<p>PowerPoint unfortunately allows its users to fall into the same trap, insofar as people can fire up the program, get started, and plow through to their objective (&quot;create a presentation&quot;) without the due diligence to plan, structure, and consider their audience&#x27;s expectations and attention span. That&#x27;s not the software&#x27;s fault...well, maybe in some respects because it doesn&#x27;t have the hard learning curve to keep it out of the hands of those who shouldn&#x27;t be diddling with it (Garageband vs. Ableton Live is a reasonable comparison), but there&#x27;s nothing inherently bad about PowerPoint. Nope, it&#x27;s a good piece of kit. The idiots that use it on the other hand? Yeah, software can&#x27;t fix them, nope, no way, no how...<p>Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I have to go back to deleting 17 extra Master Slides, adjusting page numbers so they all align, re-pasting graphics from Excel as Enhanced Metafiles instead of JPGs, fixing the header font size to be consistent, and wondering what kind of demon decided to change the font from Arial to Calibri in random places! \n<i>(Not really, but been there, done that, got the T-shirt)</i>",1432736258

Also, man, this got long in short order. But it&#x27;s an important topic.<p>Now if they could just learn to properly speak English. I know that sounds like something an asshole says, but it&#x27;s really an issue that should not be overlooked just because someone has been trained to be politically correct and for some reason accept poor language skills by one group of people, yet not from another. Would you be ok with a black person that speaks &quot;ebonics&quot; but is otherwise equally competent?<p>In reality it is a significant issue because you frequently simply cannot understand those of Indian descent unless they have been in the USA for at least a generation. It&#x27;s not really limited to Indians, it also and ever more frequently applies to Chinese, but they are not the subject of this article. There are whole departments in tech companies that are staffed with essentially nothing but Indians who speak various Indian languages among each other and have such strong dialects when speaking English that it is almost impossible to understand them. There is even explicit discrimination going on in those kinds of companies that prevents someone like a &quot;real American&quot;, a person who speaks English to a satisfactory and comprehensible degree from being hired. Are you going to work with a whole department of Indians that speak a foreign language to each other and actively ostracize you? Are you even going to get an interview as a Duane, Chad, Becky, Omar, Mercedes, Juliana, Marcos, etc.?<p>This rise of the &quot;burgeoning new elite&quot; is just another symptom of the corporate and elite sell out of America. Indians were allowed to immigrate to the USA through various visa programs in order to quickly bolster corporate tech capacity on the cheap due to the ramifications of incompetent investments in education and insufficient support for engaging our poor and under-educated people. Essentially, America&#x27;s corporate overlords took the easy route and sold out Americans by kicking the can down the road. What they did was the equivalent of taking out car title and pay day loans in order to fund their lavish lifestyles of exploitation.<p>What should become more and more apparent to people, although I don&#x27;t see any real signs of it happening or grabbing hold, is that America is nothing but a big feeding frenzy by the wealthy and powerful. There really is no sense of culture and society worth mentioning. As upsetting as that notion is, what we consider American and defining of our culture is really just all expression corporate interests and exploitation.<p>What people don&#x27;t quite get about America, even the 99%ers of Americans, is that although the economy is of course not a zero sum game, it is a limited game that can be represented by the ever popular pie, but where the pie represents a ratio of wealth and income. Or, another way of putting it, you can think of it as an ever replenishing pie. Do you have your mental model and visualization in place? Ok, let me explain.<p>The thing about America is that there is a defined barrier, a gated community, if you will, between the 1% and 99% and that barrier has been erected in such a manner that 99% of the ever replenishing parts of the pie go to the 1%, or simply that the 1% get 99% of the pie and the rest of the 99% have to share a single sliver of 100 pieces that the pie is cut into. The problem with immigration, whether illegal laborers or H1B, is that they are all dumped into the same pool of 99% that have to share that one single tiny sliver of pie of the 100 pieces that the pie has been cut into, which makes getting ahead or increasing income next to impossible.<p>Sure there are outliers and exceptions, and I am sure that the &quot;success&quot; of these &quot;burgeoning new elite&quot; would be cited as counter arguments, but the rule simply is that under normal circumstances it is next to impossible to make headway when immigrants keep getting dumped into the labor pool, whether it be construction, manufacturing, agriculture, service, or even all the tech jobs. That is the real reason why not only poor people in America can&#x27;t make any headway and also why students are being buried under student loan debt while the prospective wages they can earn with the degree they hold has been driving down by cheap H1B tech labor and outsourcing.<p>These are real consequences of immigration. I know that we all have been indoctrinated to love the shit out of some immigration because it has always been critical to the American elite to further their agenda of exploitation and domination, but reality is that what you have been led to believe is counter-productive to your own self-interest. And to think there are some people who don&#x27;t believe that people will act against their own self interest.",1432735466

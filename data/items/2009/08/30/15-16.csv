It would make more sense to write:<p>1.) Managers impose deadlines and put pressure on employees to meet them<p>2.) Employees do sub-standard work to meet deadlines<p>3.) Sub-standard components cause deaths<p>4.) Therefore employees doing sub-standard work kill people<p>That would be an argument to jail all the workers at companies whose products do harm.<p>Or you could write:<p>1.) Companies exist to make profits<p>2.) The profit motive encourages some companies to cut corners<p>3.) Cutting corners sometimes leads to death<p>4.) Therefore, the profit motive causes deaths<p>That would be an argument to get rid of the profit motive, but it wouldn't be an argument to increase punishments over whatever base line of punishments already exist.<p>Or how about:<p>1.) The law holds corporate executives responsible for the financial performance of their companies.<p>2.) The profit motive encourages some companies to cut corners.<p>3.) Cutting corners leads to situations where people die.<p>4.) Therefore the law is causing people's deaths.<p>That would be an argument for punishing those who create the laws, rather than those who obey them.<p>Or what if we take this logic to its extreme?<p>1.) The people of a democracy elect representatives to create laws.<p>2.) The law holds corporate executives responsible for the financial performance of their companies.<p>3.) The profit motive encourages some companies to cut corners.<p>4.) Cutting corners leads to situations where people die.<p>5.) Therefore the people who elected the representatives who created the laws are causing people's deaths.<p>In this last scenario, all of the people in the nation deserve to be punished.",1251647002

Price goes up faster past 4 tesla, and 8 tesla reaches safety limitations.<p>In-plane resolution is roughly proportional to the field gradient. On 3 tesla machines, you can get voxels on the order of 1mm x 1mm x 2.5mm [1]. On a 1.5 tesla machine, you get 2mm x 2mm x 3mm. I'm told Japan typically works in the 0.5-0.75 tesla range, so expect resolution at least as bad as 4mm x 4mm x ??.

The most effective system for detecting fraud is to investigate a low but random number of cases in depth, and build an algorithm find the most likely cases of waste and fraud and then weed them out.  Look at how the IRS operates for a good example of this.<p>PS: If anything the best number to look for would be the  quality of care vs cost.<p>The fastest way to save money on US heath care would be to ban or more tightly regulate medical advertising in the US. In one day you could save 8+ billion a year in direct costs and far more than that in indirect costs.

It just works and it leaves all the power in the world at my hands.  I can make it do my bidding fast as lightning and it never gets in my way.  Once you begin to get the basic principles of slack, it very closely follows the principle of least surprise.",1251644732

The relevant question is, ""how much could Germany save if they put a greater effort into weeding out waste and fraud?""<p>My point is that you simple can't look at administrative costs alone, since there is an important tradeoff between admin costs and waste/fraud costs. To determine who is closer to the optimum, we need data on (admin+waste+fraud), not simply admin.<p>Similarly, you can't say ""GM spends 1% of costs on programmers, while 37signals spends 95% on programmers, therefore GM is more efficient."" You have to know what those programmers produce.",1251644418

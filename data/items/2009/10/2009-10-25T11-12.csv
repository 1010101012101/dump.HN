They probably leaned on it a lot for the various optimizations they did during the snow leopard development cycle.

I also believe the chances of finding, say, a good enough Scala programmer to fix this software that has a problem are actually higher than the chances of finding a good enough C++ programmer to fix this other software that has a problem.<p>I have no evidence, the reasoning is outlined in my other comment.  I suspect we agree on all major points, and that things should be better than they are.",1256471145

You know, with the up/down voting options, etc.<p>Also, how to quote in comments, and how to post code having it displayed in a fixed width font.<p>There are probably more features which I, and probably other members of the community would appreciate if they were documented.<p>(although, this poll thing might be risky, if some might misuse it, and will turn this site into a stupid poll site, but I am not afraid too much since the signal-vs-noise ratio has been kept very well ever since).",1256471019

I can drink lots of it but during the times when I don't have access, it doesn't really bother me.

901529,comment,901411,901520,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> It's a fallacy that one can simply go out and grab any one of a bazillion very good C++ programmers whenever you like/need, becuase we know that hiring good programmers is hard.<p>Agreed; however your still missing the focus of the example. With a critical super urgent bug in a piece of ATC software it is MUCH easier to track down a competent C++ programmer within the hour (at any time of the day) than a Scala one - simply on the statistics of it :D",1256470943
901528,comment,901411,901518,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"You make my point.<p>Many programmers only have experience of web applications or services, and complain that some dinosaurs insist on 20-year-old languages.<p>My point is that there are fields in which this convservatism is the correct attitude, and that programmers who point the finger and laugh at such out-dated thinking lack experience.<p>I work in a field that requires fewer bugs than most (although it's not as severe as ATC), and we don't have much choice about the languages we use.",1256470934
901527,comment,901411,901464,0,0,ErrantX,,,"No my point was that if a critical bug appears in the system and you, the original contractor, has dropped off the radar (or whatever) they stand a much higher chance of finding someone to fix it.<p>This is what we do for Bank software; they find a critical flaw that needs fixing and it is our job to hunter-killer for it and work with their team to nail it and integrate the solution.<p>I agree with the point you were making; just I felt the example was more driven by a different need (one very specific to that piece of software)<p>(or look at it another way there is much more likely to be a C programmer with experience in ATC software, an important sub-skill in this case, than a Scala one :D)",1256470835

Either (a) we have it (formally) proved (no one reasonable doubts 1 + 1 = 2) or (b) we rely on tons of everyday experience to note that it doesn't fail (we mostly trust our cars).<p>Scala has neither.

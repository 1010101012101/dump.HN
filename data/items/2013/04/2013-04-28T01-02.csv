5619855,comment,5619186,5619490,1,0,kenko,,,"No, as the linked post points out.<p>Many businesses do not have the goal of simply turning money into more money. For a long time, the goal of GM was to make cars. It would be insane to open, say, a used bookstore if making money were your <i>sole</i> goal. But some people are really into books and want to buy and sell them, not necessarily even running their businesses in the most ruthlessly efficient way for making money. That's not what they're into. There are businesses whose goal it is to make, say, quality hand tools, or knives. There are businesses that deliberately manage how many clients they take on in order to ensure that they can turn out a quality product, <i>even though</i> a less good product would probably <i>not be detectable</i> by their clientele and would increase their profits. This is known as having pride in one's profession or in one's craftsmanship. Of course they also have to make money to stay in business.<p>There's a famous example of a largely technological company rejecting the mantra that their purpose is to turn money into more money---Craigslist.<p>There's also a famous if apocryphal example of an individual programmer having the kind of pride in craft that would lead to the decision not to do something that would increase profits, namely the Story of Mel.<p>The whole shareholder thing is a stupid myth that needs to die, anyway.",1367114205

But for almost none of the reasons the Author described.<p>The author makes a case that every 3D print manufacture has known since the day they started.  Each ""squirt"" of print media is a volumetric dot. A Voxel.<p>The problem is that each brand printer has a different sized ""dot"". So the Voxels from one format might not directly correspond to your object. Sure some printers could print at a lower resolution [larger dot / voxel], but rendering a pattern from a smaller voxel to a larger is VERY difficult. Errors result in pieces that don't connect, or detail being removed.<p>Polygons work like the ""How many tennis balls on the bus"" and create a container for the media, but also allow for non spherical output. You can build a column or an arch from a steady stream of media. You can't do this with voxels.<p>Voxels would work better if we were in Zero Gs as well because Printers can't actually make round dots, they are always deformed by gravity and contact.",1367114189

It was an insult for me to think that I was ever anything like them""<p>It is possible that some rare people possess this ability from birth. Most of us have had to learn it. There is a way to gain this skill, and that way is by trying, failing, then trying again.<p>By your own account, you have not been trying until very recently. You should not expect to succeed on your first attempt or perform at the level of individuals that have been working at it for years.  The good news is that your failure is not a reflection of anything intrinsic to your being, it is a reflection on the way people learn good study skills and work habits.<p>It sounds like you are arriving at this conclusion on your own, and I strongly encourage you to adopt a learning mindset where intelligence and achievement are things gained through practice and gradual improvement rather than characteristics engrained from birth.<p>There are good studies on the value of this mindset from the field of developmental psychology. A quick scan of the literature turns up a few. I didn't look very hard here, but you may find them worth a quick scan and a starting point for further investigation:<p><a href=""http://academic.reed.edu/motivation/docs/DangerousMindsetsPublished.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academic.reed.edu/motivation/docs/DangerousMindsetsPu...</a>

5619794,comment,5618776,5619701,2,0,what_ever,,,"I am a Java developer as well and I use Ubuntu on both my personal and work machine. I think I have equivalent key combinations/mouse gestures for most of the things you listed. e.g.<p>two finger scroll and two finger right click is almost universal now. When inside a browser, I rarely use the mouse scroll and prefer to use spacebar or up/down keys to scroll for granularity and I know where each action is going to land me (spacebar = page down, up/down key = just one line)<p>For forward/back I use Alt + right/left arrow. This works in browser, file browser, Eclipse. I suppose this would work in IntelliJ as well. In Eclipse, This doesn't take to the last place you made edit at, but the last place you had focused at (across files). Besides there is a shortcut Ctrl + q to go to the last place of edit (across files) in Eclipse. There are equivalent shortcuts in other editors that I have used.<p>There is no equivalent of Expose in Ubuntu. But how does it differ from using Alt + tab? When all the windows are exposed do you have to move your mouse pointer to the window you want to focus on and four fingers again? I think that's how I remember it. I love Ubuntu's Alt + tab and Alt + ` to be honest. You can also use left/right arrow keys with these two options. Granted, I do have to take my hand of Ctrl if I am doing copy/paste.<p>So three finger double click seems to be the only action I see myself to be missing that I would use.<p>As I programmer, I am typing for most of the time. So honestly, I think keyboard shortcuts work faster as I don't have to move one of my hand everytime. This is specially true if you are working on a desktop as you really have to move your hand to the magic mouse. YMMV though.<p>One of the things I hated about Mac was there are no equivalent of 'Super' key shortcuts which are present on both Windows and Ubuntu. Like Super + 1 launches the first application in my doc. This is much faster than opening spotlight and launching an application from there using a keyboard. Also, some of the shortcuts are not universal. Chrome used Ctrl + tab to change the tab and Firefox used Cmd + tab (I suppose?). Being from Windows/Ubuntu background, it was really frustrating to get used to the Cmd key at some of the places.<p>One more mouse gesture related thing I would like to add is that I love FireGestures add-on on Firefox. If I am just reading news/sites and not typing, I use my mouse and FireGestures + mouse works great. Firefox is my primary browser and I didn't find any equally good extension for Chrome.",1367112432

5619737,comment,5619595,5619595,2,0,jcr,,,"Cybernetics is a catch-all term for using multiple fields to study any
system involving feedback loops or state changes, usually with the goal
of optimization. Since the term ""system"" is loosely defined as just
about anything and many disciplines can be used to study them, in very
general terms cybernetics can be considered the study of cause and
effect.<p>Some promote the scientific approach of repeatable experiments with
data, but others promote the interpretive ""arts"" approach since
repeatable experiments are impossible in some situations. One of the
more distinctive qualities of cybernetics is the attempt of using
multiple disciplines to achieve both depth and breadth of analysis. Of
course, the trouble is there are always more fields and methods
available, so the depth and breadth can always be increased.<p>A recent discussion on HN involved an article that <i>might</i> be classified
as cybernetics:<p>""Cognitive Overhead, Or Why Your Product Isn't As Simple As You Think
(techcrunch.com) ""
<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5583759"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5583759</a><p>The article did a good job of explaining the feedback loop caused by
""Cognitive Load"" and providing solid examples. On the other hand, it
lacked breadth. They missed the important difference between ""start
load"" and ""run load"" as well as the effects of continued load over time.
They made a good point about how reducing _initial_ cognitive load is
good for growth due to reducing friction. They missed how _continuing_
load results in people gaining experience and familiarity (e.g. learning
more uses, learning additional features, etc.). They also missed how
these slowly trained users result in an effective form of vendor lock-in
by becoming an impediment to competition (resistance to change). It
might seem odd and obvious, but both time and experience are important
state changes worth understanding and measuring.<p>DISCLAIMER: I hate to let anyone down, but I'm actually not very well
versed in cybernetics. The only reason why I know about this stuff is
due to my dad (in his mid 70's) having his masters degree in cybernetics
(communications in business environments).",1367111111

There was always a menu or some other way, the right-click was just a shortcut (so I've heard). There were things in Windows and common applications that couldn't be accessed without a right click. It's also less confusing for new computer users.<p>Of course today, that's all basically gone.

   * If nobody does, he proposes to cut a slightly larger slice and asks who 
     wants it?  The proposed slice gets larger and larger until somebody 
     calls out 'yes'
     
   * Once somebody says they want the slice, it is 
     actually cut and given to them.

This balances peoples 'greediness' against their desire to get a slice.  You can keep waiting and waiting for the proposed slice to get larger, but the risk is somebody else will call for it first.  If you keep waiting for a large slice, the pizza will eventually be gone and you will have none.  It forces everybody to choose the smallest size they would be satisfied with, until all the pizza is gone.",1367110893

I am sick of these 'internet is a bonanza' arguments that are made by people without any direct experience.<p>The economics of the nternet are very unforgiving for small bands, or even small <i>genres</i>. I listen to/used to DJ a flavor of music a called goa trance, which was obscure enough that the typical sales on an album were about 2-3000 units. If you sold 5000 albums you had a modest hit. The best-selling record in the genre sold 85,000 copies. Nobody got rich of it but you could put out an album and travel a bit on it, and it would at least keep a roof over one's head and maybe pay for another synthesizer - the typical album cost $20, which is not unusual in specialist genres. So an artist who sold 5k copies of an album could make $25-50,000 with a bit of luck; at worst getting your album out meant some additional part-time income that you could put back into your studio gear, plus some bookings.<p>Nowadays, you're lucky to sell a few hundred copies of an album. When Napster came along it crushed most of the labels, which were not parts of some big corporate conglomerate but were most co-ops run by the musicians themselves. It's much harder for new acts in this genre to get traction because there isn't as much capital floating around to organize parties and do basic marketing. As has been pointed out elsehwere, touring isn't free - and this is true even though the goa community had a lot of similarities to the hippy community in terms of couchsurfing, networking and so on, but things like plane tickets and so on still cost cash up front.<p>A lot of musicians wound up abandoning it to work in more commercial styles. Now, nobody was owed a living for working in this genre, but here was a nice little international scene that had seen several years of healthy organic growth over the space of a decade, and the 'music should be free' approach caused it to virtually collapse outside of Europe.",1367110858
5619723,comment,5619335,5619531,1,0,anonymous,,,"Well, yes. But just because you can uncover such a mechanism doesn't mean you have an explanation for the behaviour. For example, in times of plague, people would put heavy stones on the graves of people to prevent them from raising again as vampires. Incidentally, since there were more dead than usual during plague, they were buried in shallow graves, which take less time to make, and dogs might dig them up, which increased the risk of contagion. By putting heavy stones on top, roaming dogs couldn't dig them up and there was less contagion and less death. So even though the behaviour had a perfectly reasonable mechanism by which it lowered the number of deaths, the mental explanation was way off.<p>Also, just because someone might feel that way about men or women, doesn't mean we should be shaming women who want to have sex, now that there's practically no risk of unwanted pregnancies. Insisting that people act reasonably isn't some utopian ideal, but is more like the cornerstone of modern society.",1367110843

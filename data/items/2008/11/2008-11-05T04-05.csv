The main problem with the U.S. is that it has had 150 years of racial warfare - whites hating on blacks, blacks hating on whites.  All of it has been entirely destructive, and it really needs to stop.<p>Try watching a couple episodes of The Corner ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Corner-Year-Life-Inner-City-Neighborhood/dp/0767900316"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Corner-Year-Life-Inner-City-Neighborho...</a> ).  It's based on a the account of a journalist who spent a year following a family in Baltimore.  It also matches my personal experiences in working for various inner city charities.

I don't particularly like php (though I've made sites with it) so I'd prefer not to go that route.

Rather than talk of <i>switching</i> from asp.net to Django, it's important to just run out and do a few quick and dirty projects to get your feet wet. From there you can make a personal decision about it.<p>If you're looking to learn new things, instead of just picking up a new framework, I think there is a lot to be said for stringing together your own framework. In that regard, PHP is a really easy way to get started, although the language isn't overwhelmingly gorgeous.<p>Django does open up some interesting work opportunities, especially it's somewhat over-represented in the small/medium newspaper world.",1225858103

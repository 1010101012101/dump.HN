This reminds me of the architecture of Nginx.<p>If someone could create a FastCGI implementation as a provider, this would be awesome. Then certain routes could be passed off to Ruby, PHP, Mono, (whatever) and simple things like static files, pub-sub, cache, etc can be handled by node.<p>I definitely like where they're going with the project and with the ExtJS team behind it, it should be a success.",1277060373

I also like how I view everything in life differently because coding is a huge part of it.<p>The other day someone asked why I always respond to their texts 'no matter what,' and I said, 'well, people with a friendship level of 1 or higher always get a response.' They asked me to give them my friendship levels, so I had to make up a system on the spot- I said 'lowest should be (-2), wait no- (-1) so I can use bitwise operators,' and then structured the system around the use of bitwise operators just because I thought it was cute.<p>The fun in coding is the same fun that you receive in web design, however, I like to think that coding gives me more pleasure in more areas because I can use concepts I learn in everyday use, like ranking friends.",1277060287

One step is when you think in your own language and translate everything over. The next step is when you think in the language. Enjoyable coding comes only when you think in terms of the programming language. But that only happens once you run into problem domains where you have substantial thoughts, and once you use languages that allow for those kinds of thoughts. Or, once you're used to one type of language and one way of thinking about things, learning to speak another is enjoyable as well. (Imperative vs. functional programming, etc.)",1277057218

Asymmetrical stuff is helpful since most of our activities don't happen on both sides at once (for instance, like carrying groceries) So carry one dumbbell around the house or office with you while you do other things. Set it down. Pick it up with each hand. Put it under the desk. Then fetch it out. Do the things you do every day but do them with weight.

My point was CSS is, despite its poor design, fundamentally easy to understand in terms of how it's supposed to work. No, it doesn't always work like it's supposed to and sometimes you have to work around that, but at its core, the syntax, the structure, and methodology behind it are dead simple. Building something like LESS/SASS to run on top of/underneath CSS to then generate said CSS markup seems redundant, when instead what needs to happen is that the focus needs to be on fixing the flaws of CSS, not adding another layer of abstraction.<p>And how does LESS/SASS handle all of those hacks?

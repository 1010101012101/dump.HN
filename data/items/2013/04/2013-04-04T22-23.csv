If you were born somewhere around 1955, by the time you were in your early 20s you had the chance to start the biggest personal computer or operating system software company in the world. If you were web-savvy in the late 90s and early 00s you could have created online payment systems, web stores, a search engine, or a social network.<p>It's 2013 and I have no idea what the next big thing(s) might be. Things feel small now, like everyone's picking off the lowest-hanging fruit, e.g. trivial mobile apps, me-too companies, X-for-Y startups, etc.<p>But in this post, I ask HN: what fields are going to be big, and how can a young engineer/entrepreneur be apart of them early on?<p>Cheers",1365116394

The Court ruled that management of the Cubs could choose to ignore short-term profits from night baseball if it thought that the franchise was best served by keeping the traditional purity of the game.[1]  (Of course, the Cubs ultimately relented, but maybe that's why they haven't won the World Series).

Building and maintaining a service you care about--even if only you and your friends are the ones using it--will help you work on skills that will continue to come in handy.<p>2. Learning to set realistic expectations. This is more than just saying, if you think it will take 1 month, it will actually take 2-3, etc. This is about learning how much you personally can handle without biting off more than you can chew. I know that, early on, I had hugely ambitious personal projects, and in many ways I still do, but I no longer get frustrated at myself for taking longer than I'd like to complete certain features. And, most importantly, I no longer feel like I'm letting down clients and friends, because I am less likely to give them unrealistic estimates.<p>3. The opportunity to spark more ideas. You may set-off with one goal in mind, only to find a much more interesting problem to solve. And that's okay. But sometimes the only way to find these nuggets is to get your hands dirty and start exploring a problem domain. Even if it never leads to a project of your own, you can blog about your ideas and maybe it will inspire someone else.<p>Anyway -- those are just my two cents. Don't feel like you have to change the world with your ideas, but also (and I guess this is the point I was trying to get at) don't be afraid to just try things out and see where they lead.",1365115133

This design pattern makes responsive design a little bit more difficult. The main challenge is that the width of the main content pane changes depending on the state of the sidebar. Your media query to scale down an element or rearrange a layout, often has to default to happening at a greater window width than otherwise necessary (if the sidebar is collapsed), because of the potential for the sidebar being open. There are some gross ways to work around this with JS, but I don't think it's worth it. An element query would make it easy to watch the width of the main content pane, independent of the sidebar pane's state.<p>If you create an account at Stipple.com and log in, you'll see an example of what I'm talking about (disclosure: I'm an engineer at Stipple).",1365115130

Now the politicains are sayin' ""Oh send in the marines to secure the area, cause they don't give a shit, won't be their kid over there gettin' shot just like it wasn't them when their number got called cause they were all pullin' a tour in the National Guard.

He comes back to find that the plant he used to work at, got exported to the country he just got back from, and the guy that put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job cause he'll work for 15 cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
Meanwhile, he realises the only reason he was over there in the first place was so that we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price, and ofcourse the oil companies use a little skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices, a cute little ancilliary benefit for them, but it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

Squat all the way down while keeping your weight on your heels and sit there for a while. Do you have a tendency to want to tip forward onto the balls of your feet when you do that? If so, that's a problem and you need to practice this position more.<p>- Get a foam roller and foam roll all sides of your legs (especially your IT band) and your glutes before squatting. I have chronic IT band tightness on one side that pulls on something in my knee and gives me pain around the patellar tendon, but it goes away when I foam roll the side of my leg.<p>- Do lots of warmup reps with bodyweight and/or just the bar.<p>- Don't stop at parallel. Squat below parallel, until you get a ""bounce"" from the stretch reflex of your hamstrings. If you stop at parallel, there is shearing force on the patellar tendon as that's where the tension is at the time when you change directions. But if you go all the way down, there is almost no load on your patellar tendon at the bottom when you change directions--the load is transferred to your glutes and hamstrings.<p>Based on what you've told me, I really think it's likely you aren't squatting down low enough, and that's irritating your patellar tendons.",1365113982

I saw first-hand how co-workers struggled with making the switch from desktop publishing to web; it was awful for them, but it would have been worse for everyone if the web had never come along at all. Many high schoolers are given aptitude tests that show the future growth of the industries they showed potential in. These same tests are probably available for free online at this point. Think less about the individual and more about the bigger picture; the individual will get through it and the opportunity to do something grand has much greater return for everyone.<p>Another way to look at it: a lot of people will work for companies they morally or ethically despise, but the pay and other factors keep them around until they've accumulated enough of this dirty money to go on to use it to do better things.

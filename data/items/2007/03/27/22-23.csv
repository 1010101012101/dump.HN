6718,comment,6716,6716,0,0,dfranke,,,"Paul's recent mentions about scaling Y Combinator have prompted me to give some thought to the matter myself, but the first thing I realized is that I don't really know what's preventing it from scaling.  What's the current limiting factor?<p>Amount of money available to invest?<p>How much attention you can pay to the people you fund?<p>The number of applications that don't suck?<p>And given an unlimited supply of the current limiting factor, how much bigger could you get before running up against one of the other two?",1175036143

Also, I personally think that the previous sentence could use a little work, because ""you probably are"" could mean ""you probably are not smart enough"".<p>Feel free to delete this comment after changes are made.",1175036126

Possibly draining?  Yes, but if you're determined, I believe this is better than getting distracted by a consulting business.  Time will tell if this is wise though.",1175036039
6714,comment,6668,6708,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I've often wondered whether you could make a lot of progress by bringing together hackers with, for example, doctors or lawyers. These are people who use computers every day but probably don't spend much time thinking about how to hack a solution to their computing problems. <p>As a scientist I've had a lot of success looking for the simple yet groundbreaking problems that occur at the boundaries between very different disciplines. It can be difficult not to make 'stupid' mistakes  in a discipline with which you are unfamiliar...but it's a lot easier than trying to work faster and smarter on the exact same problem as everyone else!<p>Surely interdisciplinary collaboration could be just as valuable in startups.",1175035880

6711,comment,6681,6681,0,0,BrandonM,,,"At first I was thinking, <i>Wikipedia is great as is.  Besides, why compete with a free product?</i>  Once I actually visited the site and read the philosophy, however, I have to concede that it's at least worth a shot.  This idea is clearly the result of someone saying, ""What is wrong with Wikipedia, and how can we fix it?""  The main problems, as I see it, are:<p>1. Defacing of high-profile articles.\n- This is potentially solved by requiring the use of real names, and also by the oversight.<p>2. Perceived inaccuracy.\n- While Wikipedia does at times have inaccuracies, the reality is that the media and others who do not often use it have an exaggerated view of the extent of the inaccuracy. By adding expert oversight, this should quell some of the cries regarding lack of reliability.<p>The only potential problems I see is that Wikipedia already has a lot of inertia, which includes a much better name.  Citizendium is just too hard to say to become a buzzword.  It will also see much slower growth, and I posit that it will never be able to reach the size of Wikipedia, because its growth function is inherently less steep.<p>That said, one could contend that the majority of quality articles on Wikipedia are submitted by a very small minority of the users.  If even some of these authors move to Citizendium due to frustration with the constant maintenance of their articles or the incorrect perception of inaccuracy, then Citizendium truly has a chance.  But someone still needs to change the name.",1175034183

6709,comment,6668,6687,0,0,pg,,,"We often think about that.  We could hire assistants, so we didn't have to do everything ourselves.  Or we could make YC work more peer-to-peer.  Or we could build a robot that would walk around telling everyone ""don't make users register,"" ""delete half the text on your frontpage,"" ""face the audience when you're presenting,"" etc, and I could just hang out in the next room with a book and a cup of tea.",1175033572
6708,comment,6668,6668,0,0,herdrick,,,"Excellent.  The essay and talk together produced several surprises.  The essay cleared up things things that the video obscured (couldn't see the visuals), like the ""not-so-smart"" / ""enterprise software"" connection (I was thinking he just meant the competition was dumb so you'd have the one-eyed man / land of the blind advantage).  <p>The big surprise is that YC hasn't seen an order of magnitude increase in applicants from their first round.  You'd think this impossible: Paul announced the first YC program only about a week before its deadline and they got something like 250 applications.  Now they are all over the tech news and they still haven't cracked 1000?  Maybe PG's new speaking approach (memorize, practice, use visuals) is an effort to get more people fired up?  <p>Paul, regarding this new speaking style: you <i>could</i> make yourself into a Steve Jobs dynamo of a speaker, but I think you shouldn't.  Your usual wordsmith style is probably better for attracting nerds.      <p>Question: Paul, it sounds like you've mostly swung in the direction of encouraging people to look at their own lives for problems to solve.  Whereas in ""Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas"" you were saying the opposite, like in the two paragraphs starting with ""Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas... ""  Trevor says something similar in the footnotes.  But it looks like YC has been placing all its bets on the first sort of ideas.  There's a good reason: all the huge software successes come from the ""build it for you and your friends"" model because those are the problems you fully understand.  But it's more common to find software companies making solid profits on products they built for others' problems.  Am I overlooking YC companies building products designed for other people?  Is the problem that there just aren't enough potential founders like the Octopart guys: people deeply involved in some non-computing world who also happen to be good programmers?  If so, maybe the richest source of ideas and cofounders would be cruising web forums for the near-programmers (people who build things like MS Access half-solutions to their companies' problems) to listen to what they would like to build if only they knew how. Maybe YC should be recruiting there, too.  Thoughts?\n",1175033561

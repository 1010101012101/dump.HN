3390783,comment,3389678,3390326,4,0,yzhengyu,,,"This is the same argument that the leaders of my country, Singapore, foisted on us, that we need to have immigration to ""close the gap"", so-to-speak.<p>This was in the late 1990's, then they began a program of liberalized immigration which now in 2011, sees over 30% of Singapore's resident population as foreigners. The influx of so many immigrants over two decades has caused severe strains upon the fabric of our country, a tiny island city-state.<p>Yet the story remains the same. The new immigrants are unlikely to suddenly produce more children [say three or more] and ironically, if they stay on, they will simply add on the the oncoming demographic crunch since they are mostly working class, and we all know how that particular segment of society is assaulted by growing inequality around the world.<p>[Most amusing, the incumbent political party which has governed Singapore since our independence has largely expended all its political capital. But that's not really relevant to our discussion on aging + demographics]<p>I suspect Britons in the U.K can tell a similar story, since Blair & co went on a similar tilt after they got in a decade ago.<p>Thus, I would caution against the popular view that immigration is needed to avoid the oncoming demographic crunch in societies. It probably can't fix the old issue, and instead generate many huge socio-political issues.",1324806360

In the pre-OS X days applications were often bundled by placing images, audio, etc. in the application file's resource fork. I remember in the 90's finding an application that had a huge (for its day) multi-megabyte resource fork, but only a few kilobytes of program data in the data fork.<p>That is what the ""_macosx"" folder contains, only these days the resource fork is only used to store cached data such as thumbnails, window positions, etc. But it didn't always use to be that way, and for compatibility's sake we're stuck :(",1324805934

3390769,comment,3390081,3390699,5,0,palish,,,"- full stack programmer. My focus is always on the quality and robustness of the final design, regardless of which specific technologies/components are used. I learn them all.<p>- a deep knowledge of the details. I share Robert Morris' passion for understanding precisely what is going on at every level. My insight into the low-level details of next-gen CPUs came from reading the Intel architecture manuals several times over.<p>- an ability to achieve high-quality results within a very short period of time, regardless of the project or goal. If you show me a problem, I'll show you a solution by the end of the day, probably with a rough prototype. By a week, I'll have discovered which solution/direction is the best long-term strategy, and will have a working production version 1.<p>- I have good judgement. This turns out to be rare.<p>Specific technologies:<p>- a master of C/C++. I've been coding since age 12, and I'm now 23, so that's easily 30,000+ hours I've spent practicing. I've been writing C/C++ professionally daily since my first gamedev job in 2007. Python is my language of choice; Lua a close second, primarily when performance is of concern (such as in gamedev). But a language is merely a means to an end, and I work with all of them.<p>- several years of hobby experience writing Rails websites/Javascript.  I write Lisp interpreters for fun. I want to write an Arc compiler someday.<p>- extensive sysadmin knowledge, both Unix and Windows. FreeBSD is my preferred OS for server-side deployment.<p>- master of realtime 3D graphics; both OpenGL and D3D. Given time and freedom, I can build you a renderer of the finest quality (equal or higher than Rage).<p>- artistic talent and taste.  Several years of 3D Studio Max and Maya modeling and animation experience. I build next-gen character art (high-poly sculpt in ZBrush, then decimate / build low-poly shell in 3D Coat; project detail; touch up textures via Photoshop -> rig in 3DSMax -> animate -> import into game).<p>Projects:<p>- in highschool, wrote a game engine roughly equivalent to Quake.<p>- several game engines / game ideas.<p>- a full game editor, using C#/.NET WinForms.<p>- next-gen realtime graphics experiments, including realtime skin rendering (the same technique was recently shown by Epic in their ""Good Samaritan"" demo).<p>- several Rails websites. Made a system for schools to administer tests, with the intent of surpassing Blackboard. (JavaScript-based; this was back before ""Ajax"" was a fancy buzzword.) Tried to apply to YC with it. pg gave valuable advice (selling to schools is like selling to government; quality doesn't always win). Was invited to Hacker School though, which was fun (seeing Anybots' Dexter robot in person walk around on two legs was just awesome).<p>Experience:<p>- Simutronics, <i>HeroEngine</i>.  Graphics programmer (3 years)<p>- S2 Games, <i>Heroes of Newerth</i>. Engine programmer (1 year)<p>My thirst for knowledge is unquenchable in five lifetimes, and I strive for beauty and elegance in everything I pursue.<p>If anyone feels these claims seem too bold to be true, I'd love the opportunity to work with you to prove myself while serving your interests.",1324805730

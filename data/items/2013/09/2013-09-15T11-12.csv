Those ugly C-like languages have tons of cheap or free libraries, support communities with real, large scale experience and so on. Smaller languages are much more of an adventure - fun with company (your own?) money. It is not the correct choice in many cases.<p>None of these problems seems to matter in the beginning, when the team is small and awesome, but they do massively matter later on. The author seems to completely avoid this point, and I urge them to consider it.<p>Finally, having always been a deeply language agnostic developer, I find all these language-religious arguments to be a bit childish and tiresome.",1379246211

To date I don&#x27;t think Google has offered sufficient transparency into the process to adequately restore trust.  If the NSA (via secret laws or dictums) is preventing this from happening, it is at the expense of Google&#x27;s reputation.<p>Further, the recent revelations that the NSA deploys agents as employees of various tech companies (like Google) indicates that Google&#x27;s internal security processes have been breached and the careful (and likely reasonable) way that cooperation with law enforcement has been crafted may be largely irrelevant.<p>The above may be wild speculation, and I hope it&#x27;s incorrect.  But considering the Snowden revelations I don&#x27;t think Google has done enough to make a person or firm that explicitly didn&#x27;t want the NSA to have access to data its feel comfortable using Google&#x27;s network and services to store/transmit it.<p>And, since Google&#x27;s core business is ads, Google has designed its own systems so that data from any Google service (analytics, dns, gmail, doubleclick) can be used for targeting and behavioral profiling.  The scope of it is really quite impressive.  Thus I think it&#x27;s sobering to think about all the data being readily available to the NSA, as Snowden suggests it is.",1379245267

I don&#x27;t believe this is true, and many people who have less &quot;intelligence&quot; can still find jobs. Granted, they might not be the most &quot;cushy&quot; of jobs, but they will still pay and are likely relatively satisfying. I would recommend watching the show &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; (if you haven&#x27;t already) to see many, many of the kinds of jobs where you don&#x27;t need to be a college graduate with good scores to be able to get them. Heck, you can even get a job somewhere where most people would consider you having to be intelligent to get into, without actually being good at that job. (see thedailywtf for examples of &quot;programmers&quot; who have jobs, and just make life miserable for everyone else) So many of the jobs that I&#x27;ve seen in Dirty Jobs, I cannot do. (at least right now, I guess I could learn, but it would be hard) They require a completely different degree of intelligence/intuition that I&#x27;ve never developed. Most would consider me &quot;intelligent&quot; as a programmer, but I just see it as having a certain skill set, out of many, many skill sets that exist. I doubt I&#x27;m any more intelligent than a good construction worker.<p>I&#x27;d rather see more people learn to do trades, than become &quot;smarter&quot; and likely have even less of a chance of getting a job.

Estimations are based on experience, yet developers are constantly building brand new types of products.  If all you built was &quot;blog engines&quot; over and over again, you would get damned good at estimating them.  The trick in software is as soon as something needs to be reused over and over again, it is abstracted, put in a library, built into a framework, so you can make your product different (read: build something entirely new) -- and EVERYONE sucks at estimating the cost of building things entirely new.<p>Think of the (entirely new in 1962) Lunar Module... they thought it would cost at max 350 million.   It cost 2.2 billion.  Those where very smart people with a major stake in getting the initial number right, but it was just a crazy ass guess because they had NEVER BUILT ONE BEFORE.",1379244885

I tried tons of languages, from php to js, obj-c, clojure, golang, java, scala, python and coffeescript (not really a lang tho :)). Ruby is without doubt one of the best designed languages. The syntax might not be the right thing for everyone (I don&#x27;t like python&#x27;s for instance), but the language itself is really well designed to be as natural and less surprising as possible for developers. OOP wise it&#x27;s a pleasure to work with. PHP is basically the opposite.<p>In general on the topic: Major reasons why Ruby and JS lead the whole thing is that a) the communities are extremely huge and active (in open source) and b) smaller modules/gems are preferred over huge frameworks (yes rails is huge, but it&#x27;s actually a set of other gems - sort of). And since the author sorted by the amount of projects and not the lines of code, JS leads the list due to a ton of small modules (e.g. for node.js or component).",1379244774

I present you with two envelopes, and tell you that each contains a number, and one of those numbers is twice the other.  You choose an envelope, and find that it contains the number 8.3467394756297.  You can choose to swap, if you like, and your objective is to maximize the expected value of the number in the envelope you&#x27;re holding.<p>Do you swap?  Or not?  Here&#x27;s a line of reasoning.<p>Call the number I&#x27;ve chosen Z.  The other envelope contains either Z/2 or 2Z, and it would appear to be 50:50 as to which it is.  If you swap, my expected value is then (Z/2)<i>0.5 + (2Z)</i>0.5 = 5Z/4.  That&#x27;s bigger than Z, so you should swap.<p>But that means you should always swap, which doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense.<p>Perhaps this version explains more clearly to you the paradox.  Or not, maybe you still think it&#x27;s all obvious.  In that case, could you revise your explanation for this context, away from the $20 vs $10 or $40 issues?",1379244063

3140634,comment,3139816,3140369,23,0,tptacek,,,"The whole situation is moronic.<p>It's hard to look at the whole discussion here and not wish that Cody had just asked Salvatore in private if he wanted a better hash function, rather than calling him out for it on the thread announcing Salvatore's new program. I've been exactly where Cody is and have learned that there's little productive conversation to be had when someone is excitedly announcing a new project.<p>At the same time, Salvatore was too prickly about this. His response was dictated by emotion and not his head, and it's painted him into a corner of referring to sound crypto as ""dogma"" that can be navigated by programmer common sense. He's wrong about that and I suspect he knows it. He could still have been snippy about being told to add bcrypt to his sample application, without trying to make a principled stand about the merits of different KDFs. This isn't the first time Salvatore has been stridently wrong about crypto on HN.<p>Coda, like the fabled honey badgers of yore, does not give a fuck. If you understand that going in, it's hard to be pissed at him.<p>One of the charming things about Salvatore's code is that it's build largely without deps. It is probably my favorite thing about Redis, that you can download it and simply type ""make""; it doesn't have an autoconf script and implements its own event library. It takes craftsmanship to do that on something as significant as Redis.<p>It is indeed a downside of bcrypt that it pulls in a dep. If you are avoiding deps as a matter of principle, use a different KDF (this applies <i>only to KDFs</i>; if you need encryption and you DIY, you're boned). But as soon as you write a Gemfile, I reserve the right to make fun of you for hand-rolling your KDF.",1319216386

I understand the need to sort out good developers from bad developers, but when this exam-style interview scourge finally dies out, it won't be soon enough.<p>All you're doing is optimizing for developers who can create sorting algorithms. If you're a company that specializes in developing new, groundbreaking sorting algorithms, that might make sense. But if you're a company that specializes in, say, B2B software, it doesn't make any sense at all. If one of your developers needs to sort something, they'll just use whatever's available in the libraries or frameworks or languages your company uses.<p>It might be good to see if they understand the differences between n^2 and an n log n algorithms, only because you want to see if they understand the basic concepts of performance in algorithms versus performance in code.<p>Why not ask applicants to submit examples of projects they've done or code they've written, pick a few that look interesting to you, find portions of the code or projects that look especially interesting, and ask the candidates about it? You'll get to see what kind of work they do in general, and asking them about their code should weed out the few cheeky bastards that submitted something they didn't actually write.",1319216365

Thats not a slight against antirez-I sure as hell am not a security expert either. The point is, this is an area where people shouldn't be trying to get clever. Even in this same thread, jgc has pointed out that PBKDF1 is deprecated, and that it's not designed to be slow (and thus not a good candidate for a password hashing function). Is he right? Maybe.

Once they moved into their fancy new digs, however, they faced a problem: the hot dogs weren't coming out the same. They didn't have the same distinctive red color or desired snap. They couldn't figure out what was wrong, since the ingredients, spices, cooking time, everything was the same.<p>After a year and a half, they still haven't figured it out...until one night, when some guys from the plant are out at a bar, reminiscing over drinks about the old days in the former plant. They start talking about Irving, a fixture at the old plant who knew everyone, whose job was to take the uncooked sausages to the smokehouse. But, given the ""Rube Goldberg"" layout of the old factory, it took Irving half an hour on a circuitous route to get from A to B.

We build web-based telephony applications in addition to traditional phone-based applications.<p>1. python's syntax is extremely clear and easy to read / maintain. I can open any python project, and immediately find my way around with no prior knowledge. This makes working in teams especially easy, when you have numerous developers committing various bits of code to various parts of the product throughout the day.<p>2. In the past two years, the python community has put a great amount of emphasis on documentation for open source projects (using Sphinx), and as a result of this, many open source python packages now have <i>excellent</i> documentation that makes it really easy to start using third party libraries and feel secure in your choices. Just check out <a href=""http://rtfd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rtfd.org/</a> for examples (ReadTheDocs is a hosted open source documentation site, focusing on python).<p>3. Django is an excellent web framework, and has tons of reusable open source applications that you can use, which makes rapidly developing web applications easy. The Django app ecosystem has been growing at an insane rate over the past few years, and there are more than enough applications to solve most common patterns.<p>4. Tools like tox, nose, coverage.py, and others make testing in python simple. It also helps that Django encourages testing in a large way (providing a default tests.py module for each application, with example tests). Having such a large emphasis on testing, with such great tools, makes it easy to ""Do The Right Thing"" and build tests into your software.<p>5. There are excellent tools in python for performing complex tasks, like celery / redis for building distributed queue processing workers.<p>6. PyPY (an alternative python interpreter) has been showing immense promise with python speed improvements. PyPY can be used as a drop-in python replacement on any linux system, and yields immense performance improvements to even the simplest code.<p>7. The python community in general tends to be very friendly, supportive, and encouraging. There are a lot of popular figures in the python community, and the overall personality traits of leading python community figures tends to be humble, helpful, and encouraging. This has fostered a really excellent community focused around accomplishing things, and helping people out, which I think gives the language a good overall feel.<p>Just my two cents.",1319214729

I really have one big ""passion"" and that is machine learning - genetic algorithms and related stuff, but don't have a C.S. degree so though I have (some) professional experience in that, not enough to get a research job someplace. So I am currently working in QA automation - its a job, that's about it. I have done (and continue to do) some on-again, off-again website work for relatives. I guess my ""ideal dream"" would be to expand to enough independent projects to quit my day job and therefore have flexibility to do my own pet research (like monkeys typing Shakespeare, or similar arcane but cool stuff like that, lol). I think inevitably were I to seriously go down that road, I'd have to sacrifice ""life style"" - I make in the mid-60's per year and so I'd have to ""downsize"" a bit - a smaller apartment or whatever - and that is acceptable to me - I am lucky as I don't have or want kids so I can ""downsize"" if I really wanted to. But I think downsizing is really inevitable in this kind of transition so if someone has a significant other, try and get them to be the main ""bread winner"" for a while, while one gets one's projects going maybe. :-) I wouldn't but I don't really have to, since it is just me so it is a matter of ""taking the plunge"" and I don't know if I am there yet (am only 30 so still have time). Your point number 2 is more complex. I think the key is focusing on what you like. Personally I really like the precision and control that C provides but have null - read (void*)0 - desire to learn, say, Ruby. So it sounds obvious but focus on the stuff technically you like, not necessarily what is the current popular thing of the day.

For example, one might assume the same security that HMAC provides could be achieved with MAC = H(key  message). However, this method suffers from a serious flaw: with most hash functions, it is easy to append data to the message without knowing the key and obtain another valid MAC. The alternative, appending the key using MAC = H(message  key), suffers from the problem that an attacker who can find a collision in the (unkeyed) hash function has a collision in the MAC. Using MAC = H(key  message  key) is better, however various security papers have suggested vulnerabilities with this approach, even when two different keys are used.[1][3][4]<p>No known extensions attacks have been found against the current HMAC specification which is defined as H(key1  H(key2  message)) because the outer application of the hash function masks the intermediate result of the internal hash. The values of ipad and opad are not critical to the security of the algorithm, but were defined in such a way to have a large Hamming distance from each other and so the inner and outer keys will have fewer bits in common.""<p>The why crypto works is that cryptographers -- some of the most OCD pedants you will ever know -- find a nano-scale fracture in one small relatively unimportant part of an algorithm, and then wrench it open into a gaping lava-spewing chasm of exploitation and credit card theft.<p>Please just use best practices, but realize that they will be periodically be updated.",1319213150

BFD.</i><p>Depends on what you mean by paying off the debt. If you pay off the debt by just issuing a sufficiently large amount of reserves at the Fed to do so, then yes, I would agree. Then you just transform one form of government liability (treasury bonds) into another form of government liability (reserves). No problem there.<p>But if you're actually talking about eliminating net government liabilities, you're missing the point. Here's why:<p>Individuals in the private sector <i>want</i> to accumulate net financial assets, if only to save for retirement. Every financial asset is somebody else's corresponding financial liability.<p>But retirement funds & co. are huge. Who is going to incur the necessary net financial liabilities to correspond to them? Private entities? Why would we allow private entities to run up that much debt? Also, with private entities you always have the problem that people might change their mind about their credit-worthiness.<p>The federal government, on the other hand, is at the top of the pyramid of liabilities (see e.g. here: <a href=""http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/09/mmp-blog-15-clearing-the-pyramid-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/09/mmp-blog...</a>), and they can easily incur and sustain the required net financial liabilities to allow the private sector to save in net financial assets.<p>So government liabilities play an important role in the stability of the financial system.<p>If you run down the federal debt, you end up in a situation like the Eurozone, where the entity at the top of the pyramid of liability (i.e. the ECB) does not incur sufficient liabilities (and in fact, does not have the mandate to do so, for good reason) to support a stable financial system. The debt crisis is a direct result of this flawed setup, and you would be wise to avoid copying it in the US.",1319213014

People are out there because they are not sure what to do but know that something very, very wrong.<p>I think it would be helpful if they had a leader, somebody who could articulate the thoughts of people who are there for the right reasons (to show their distaste of the current state of things).<p>It is really frustrating to hear the beneficiaries of this corruption try to dismiss the protesters as ""lazy"" when I think it takes more to get your butt outside and stay there than it does to go to work and do some busy paper pushing.<p>Side note on the corruption of this country, look at the bay bridge as an example. It's been over <i>20</i> years since the 89 earthquake and the bridge is still not completed. How can countries like China and France and Switzerland manage to finish much larger and more complicated bridges in under a year. Corruption at it's finest.",1319212848

I doubt instituting a merit-based system can be done effectively without transforming the whole system, from top to bottom.  I don't know if that's in the children's best interest, or would address the perceived problems.  Small changes to address the cases of real incompetence are probably the low hanging fruit, and don't require radical change.",1319212800

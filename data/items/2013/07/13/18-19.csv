This doesn&#x27;t seem accurate to me: doctors and nurses must be payed, medicines acquired, hospitals run, etc. The cost may be collected differently (taxation vs. insurance or at time of service) and various systems may be more or less efficient. But except in rare edge cases, no system is free.</i><p>Well, for one it&#x27;s not overpaid 10 times, as is in the US.<p>So essentially, even in the numeric sense, it&#x27;s almost free.<p>Second, for free means &quot;without having to pay directly&quot;.<p>Yes, people pay through taxes.<p>But then again, you pay taxes in the US too, and that doesn&#x27;t give you free surgery.",1373741968

It would likely be replaced with &#x27;high fructose&#x27; <some other starch>.  Fructose has properties (very sweet, doesn&#x27;t crystallize like sucrose, etc.) that junk food purveyors love and corn doesn&#x27;t even contain any fructose naturally.<p>Any starch + amylase makes a syrup (my personal favorite is rice syrup).

Steve Blank states very specifically in <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> that you start from the idea that the founder has in his head.  The &quot;get out of the building&quot; bit means to get out and <i>validate</i> that there is actually a market for the thing you are building, and - if you can&#x27;t find a market for it - then (and only then) modify the idea or change ideas.<p>It&#x27;s totally fine to have your own idea about something new that you think the world needs, and to <i>start</i> building it without any external validation.  The mistake that the &quot;lean startup&quot; movement is warning against, is to waste years of time, and millions of dollars, building something that nobody wants.   This is why &quot;customer development&quot; runs in <i>parallel</i> with &quot;product development&quot;.<p>So yeah, stay in the building long enough to come up with an idea, build a prototype if you feel the need, <i>then</i> &quot;get out of the building&quot; and show people the alternative to &quot;a faster horse&quot; that you&#x27;ve developed.<p>This really isn&#x27;t a binary situation anyway... any successful businesses is going to involve a mix of your own &quot;inside the building&quot; ideas and &quot;outside the building&quot; validation.  The goal is to find the right balance.

6038297,comment,6037464,6037464,23,0,mikepk,,,"I have some experience in this area. My first startup: Grazr (<a href=""http://tcrn.ch/aUqiIb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcrn.ch/aUqiIb</a>), the back end was mostly Perl with some custom C modules. Grazr was started in 2005 when Perl was already out of fashion.<p>So why did we choose Perl, practical reasons mostly. My co-founder had previously been the CTO of the company that owned Slashdot and he had a team of top-notch Perl people that he thought would want to join us. I had worked a lot with Perl in a previous life so it seemed like a natural fit.<p>Perl has many strengths. You can &quot;just get stuff done&quot; with Perl. The module library is obviously a huge strength. The first version (effectively a public prototype) of Grazr went live very quickly (days). If youre careful with it, you can also build some fairly complex projects using Perl. The machinery for Grazr processed a huge amount of data (for the time) multiple terabytes of feed data and had a lot of advanced features like: processing of normalized feeds, an embedded scripting language, cross link analysis, a search engine, and most of the heavy lifting was Perl. Think of the system as an advanced form of the feed API that Google Reader eventually released, nearly real-time (unlike the Reader API we updated feeds upon request) with the addition of a scripting layer on top. I&#x27;m very proud of what we built, technology-wise. We failed in other ways (UX, marketing and sales mainly) but the underlying system was quite impressive.<p>When the feed application language and processing engine stopped being the focus of the company, the Grazr system ran on only a few virtual servers, responsively and smoothly for over a year with steadily growing traffic. That was with the whole company ignoring it and focusing on other &#x27;pivots&#x27; (before pivot was the term-du-jour for that). Why the company ignored a service that was steadily growing traffic with absolutely no input from the team/company is a rant for another day. :)<p>When I co-founded my next company, Smarterer (<a href=""http://smarterer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smarterer.com/</a>), I vowed gone-with-the-wind-style that as God as my witness, I would never write a big startup-project in Perl again. Smarterer is written mainly in Python.<p>Why the Perl hate? First, I still think Perl is a fine language. You can get a lot done with it. But as other&#x27;s have pointed out, one of the primary design philosophies of the language make it painful in some cases. Large, evolving projects with multiple contributors seems to be the axis of evil for Perl. Startups exacerbate this problem because they exhibit most of these factors and compound it with unrealistic functional time pressure.<p>What I observed as problems were:<p>First, with Perl there is always a temptation to be clever. It&#x27;s a lot of fun, but one of the underlying philosophies of Perl, the &quot;Tim Toady&quot; thing, opens up a lot of temptation to show just how clever you are, usually <i>too clever by half</i>. That always leads to the WTF moments as youre reading any code you havent written in the last week. I started to feel each WTF moment as a tax on our tech team.<p>When you have a big Perl project with several contributors, coming up with coding standards is a <i>must</i> but usually in a startup environment getting something working is almost always the first priority. Also, coding standards only get you so far with Perl because it&#x27;s so flexible. If you spend any reasonable amount of time, the <i>unwritten</i> standards of how people write Perl code subtly shifts over time.  Usually the code get better as contributors influence each others coding styles, but this makes going back to read working code thats 6 months to a year old a massive pain in the ass.<p>Lastly, having coding standards doesnt protect you against <i>other peoples modules</i>. If you have a large and complex enough system, youre going to start tripping over the bugs and corner cases in other peoples modules. Perl has the strength of CPAN, but because you cant enforce a coding standard across all of Perl, debugging into other peoples modules can be an exercise in frustration. When some bug is tracked down to a third-party module, treating it as a black box is no longer an option.<p>When faced with these problems you can usually work through each case. In the best case it just takes a few minutes of working through the cognitive dissonance, but in other cases you end up breaking out the print statements and/or debugger to instrument code just to figure out <i>what the heck was the intent here</i>.<p>As a startup guy, the energy required to re parse code thats already been written in subtly different ways starts to drive you crazy because thats time and energy that could be being applied to solving the bug and tackling the new problem at hand. That re-read and re-parse tax gets worse and worse the large the project becomes and the more people that are involved.<p>Thats, generally, why I wouldnt recommend Perl as a language for a startup project, but every case is different. If you&#x27;re not in the axis-of-evil for Perl, you have <i>incredible discipline</i> and you only rely on a limited number of third-party modules you may be OK.",1373740909

It&#x27;s not exactly a SaaS, but as a subscription business, it runs on the same fundamentals: rate of acquisition, churn, customer lifetime value, cost of acquisition, etc. We have X00 subscribers and gross low six figures. The show is bootstrapped and profitable, but not yet enough of a success to allow me to hire additional employees. I launched five months ago, at the beginning of February.<p>> When did people start paying for your SaaS?<p>I launched on Kickstarter, so in a sense, people started paying right away. There were two pivotal moments in the Kickstarter: First, I got a nice bump from posting it here on HN[1]. Second, I sent announcements out to a bunch of JavaScript blogs and newsletters. The only one that posted about it was JavaScript Weekly, but that led to a <i>lot</i> of people backing the project, and that led to an additional surge of publicity and backers. Part of the reason JS Weekly posted the project was because it was already successful, thanks in part to the HN surge, so there was this definite sense of success leading to success.<p>When I launched to the public, the series had already been airing to KS backers for about seven months. I had been collecting email addresses the whole time from people who wanted to subscribe but missed the Kickstarter, and I had somewhere north of 1,000 addresses by the time I went public. So I sent out three &quot;you can subscribe now&quot; emails to that group, over the course of a month, and got a large number subscribers as a result. One of those people posted to HN[2], which led to about 70 more new subscriptions, and JS Weekly posted about the announcement as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3977240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3977240</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3977240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3977240</a><p>> How many times did it take before you got it right?<p>This particular venture was a modest success from the beginning, but I&#x27;m still working on getting it right. :-) I have a pretty compelling product (based on subscriber feedback), and it&#x27;s profitable, but I think it could be a lot more successful than it is.<p>However, this is the latest attempt out of several to launch a SaaS business. The rest were all complete failures, in that they never generated a dime.<p>> What have been the biggest factors in your success in terms of gaining traction with your SaaS?<p>1. Let&#x27;s Code JavaScript is based on a similar screencast I produced for free on YouTube[3]. That screencast was done as an experiment, but it got pretty good traction. So one smart thing I did was to recognize the appeal of the format and turn it into a subscription product.<p>2. The timing was right. JavaScript is essential to the web, and increasing numbers of people are dealing with large codebases that need serious software engineering. I&#x27;m filling a significant need that a lot of programmers are facing.<p>3. I&#x27;m well known in the Agile community and already have a decent following. That provided the &quot;seed capital&quot; to make the Kickstarter successful--and as I said before, success has bred success. It&#x27;s also made it much easier to get the word out once I opened the show to the public.<p>4. Posting to twitter, then my blog[4], then Kickstarter, allowed me to conduct a series of low-cost market tests and fine-tune my pitch. The Kickstarter took a surprising amount of effort, but it was all focused on the market. Building the market first and the product second was a great experience, especially compared to previous product attempts, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Proposing-Test-Driven-Javascript-Screencast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Proposing-Test-Driven-Javascr...</a><p>> In particular, what marketing/promo tactics have served you best?<p>1. My existing network and reputation.<p>2. The copy on the Kickstarter page resonated with people[5], and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on the demo video[6]. Both of these reinforce the existing need people have for professional JavaScript.<p>3. Being linked on news sites (such as HN and JS Weekly) and link aggregators (such as [7] and [8]).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve found the &quot;right&quot; marketing and promo tactics yet, though. I put a lot of effort into a &quot;press tour&quot; after the public launch in February. I spoke at a user group and several international conferences. It took a huge amount of effort (mostly because I had to pre-produce videos to air while I was away on those trips) and I can only point to eight subscriptions that directly resulted from those talks. I&#x27;m sure it helped raise awareness of the series, so it wasn&#x27;t a total loss, but it seems pretty low bang-for-buck.<p>Next I&#x27;m going to focus on (free) content and in-bound marketing. I&#x27;ve always been good at this, so I have high hopes. My conversion numbers are very good, so if I can get more people to visit the site, I think I can go from &quot;scraping by&quot; to &quot;major success.&quot; Time will tell.<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/188988365/lets-code-test-driven-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/188988365/lets-code-test...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.letscodejavascript.com/#demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letscodejavascript.com/#demo</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://pineapple.io/resources/lets-code-tdjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pineapple.io/resources/lets-code-tdjs</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/06/21/a-list-of-programming-screencast-series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/06/21/a-list-of-programming-scr...</a><p>I hope this helps!

I think the HFCS->obesity issue has a lot more to do with the way sugar affects our brains.<p>I think HFCS is detrimental to human survival because it has encouraged us to get all of our happiness from food, leading to overeating and eating to &quot;feel better&quot; (it never happens) in some portions of the population. Thus, we are at this obesity issue, which is really a happiness issue. From my own personal experience: When you believe in yourself and you <i>want</i> to change, obesity becomes less and less of a problem because you are motivated to work out, eat better and generally take care of yourself. But the fact remains that you once ingested a drug to feel happy which also made you fat. Now you are eating food the way you&#x27;re supposed to and not really getting that happiness that was once supplied by the sugary foods you were eating. You must use other drugs, like meditation or even alcohol/marijuana, to supplant this &quot;completeness&quot; feeling that you are missing from the lack of sugary foods.<p>Eventually, your body will give up the tolerance to sugary foods and you&#x27;ll find yourself drinking sodas and eating dessert much less than you used to. Now, the general level of HFCS in all of our foods is no longer affecting your body weight and the way you feel about yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial here, but in the last 2-3 years I&#x27;ve been very much aware of my sugar-rich diet and began to slowly wean myself off of the addiction, and I can happily say that I&#x27;ve gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist and lost over 20 pounds in the last year alone by simply being aware of how sugar affects your mind AND body, getting more exercise, and eating smaller portions of healthier food.",1373739773

This doesn&#x27;t seem accurate to me: doctors and nurses must be payed, medicines acquired, hospitals run, etc. The cost may be collected differently (taxation vs. insurance or at time of service) and various systems may be more or less efficient. But except in rare edge cases, no system is free.<p>Speak of medicine, yes, drugs are more expensive in the US than elsewhere. My understanding is that there are multiple reasons for this, including that some countries with nationalized healthcare can negotiate in bulk, Americans have more to spend, and the insane cost of R&D is primarily recouped in the American market. The rest of the world quite literally has subsidized pharmaceuticals. Edit: which is not to say that drugs are not in fact unusually expensive in the USA. But it is misleading to blithely imply that other countries are less messed up because they have cheaper pharmaceuticals.<p>Finally, the snarky comments about profit seem a bit off the mark. Do we believe that the food industries in other countries are not interested in profit?",1373738642

If you happen to live close to a public university/college, I would recommend seeing if you can take classes (some states in the U.S. allow for students to take university level classes for free, don&#x27;t know what the policies are for where you live!) or working with some of the labs. High school is horribly dull, but if you find a way to make it work for you, it can lead to larger opportunities and allow for you to build up a CV/resume while enjoying teenager-y things like school clubs/sports.",1373738591

In the spring I had to take it to a lawn mower repair shop and plop down $50 just to clean out the gummed-up lines. It&#x27;s even worse - and more expensive - for boat motors.",1373738521

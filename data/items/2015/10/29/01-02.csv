If you don&#x27;t like what Apple stocks, don&#x27;t shop in its store, and don&#x27;t buy their devices.<p>You&#x27;re right, but I hate this line of reasoning. At the end of the day, I like using an Apple product and I don&#x27;t have a problem with 99% of the things they do. So simply telling someone to &#x27;stop buying the product&#x27; when they disagree with a relatively minor issue, is silly, and it kills the discussion immediately.<p>It&#x27;s like congress passes a law I don&#x27;t like and you suggest to &#x27;leave the country&#x27;, instead of focusing on the fact it&#x27;s a bad law that could be changed without having to do something so drastic as leave the country.<p>Debate like this can help, calling them out for things that aren&#x27;t very sensible is okay and it doesn&#x27;t have to immediately be met with the obvious &#x27;under the law they can do what they want so your only recourse is to simply never use their product ever again, end of discussion&#x27;.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget when Apple changed its mind. For example, remember the iPhone 4? It introduced the LED flashlight for its camera, a feature none of the iPhones before had. Immediately flashlight apps were made, and rejected by Apple. Later it changed its mind and they&#x27;re now a staple in every app store, and later even became an integral part of the OS requiring no app at all, without any changes to the hardware. And it didn&#x27;t happen because people suddenly sold their iPhone 4 and people stopped buying iPhone 4s because they couldn&#x27;t get the flashlight app, that&#x27;d never have happened. On big features, yeah, not on small stuff.",1446083603

For example, we couldnâ€™t use Intelâ€™s x86 microprocessors because they can accept firmware updates that we cannot debug or inspect. Instead we chose an ARM-based Freescale i.MX6 system-on-a-chip, which has no such updatable code embedded. (A system-on-a-chip, or SoC, is similar to a microprocessor except it has more of the supporting hardware, such as memory and peripheral interfaces, needed to make a complete computer.) The i.MX6 does have some code burned into it to coordinate the computerâ€™s boot-up process, but this firmware canâ€™t be changed, and its unencrypted binary code can be read out and analyzed for possible security problems.<p>I&#x27;m confused. They claim the open source requirement prevented them from going with an intel chip, but then they say the reason why was because intel could push firmware updates. Furthermore, the Freescale SoC has firmware built in, but it&#x27;s not open source.<p>Is this what we consider open source these days? Sure, a good whitepaper is nice, but it&#x27;s not open source.

IMHO most of Instapainting&#x27;s customers would be better off applying a &quot;painterly&quot; filter in Photoshop to their photos and have them printed to canvas at their nearest Costco.<p>Paintings of photos look like paintings of photos because they&#x27;re crippled by the artefacts of the source photo such as unnatural perspective (which is why the &quot;normal&quot; 50mm lens is a thing), inaccurate colours and clipped highlights due to the limited dynamic range of even pro-level DSLRs.<p>Professional painters take years to hone their craft and learn the rules of composition that make a painting look good. E.g., one of my favourite painters is the watercolour virtuoso Joseph Zbukvic. Here&#x27;s a video where he quickly paints an impressionistic Melbourne street scene: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81w9PBZOmZ8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81w9PBZOmZ8</a>. Because he&#x27;s not slavishly copying the photo he&#x27;s free to rearrange the composition and add elements to make it more pleasing. He makes it look easy but that&#x27;s because he&#x27;s one of the best.<p>Buying original paintings from professional artists doesn&#x27;t have to be that expensive. This past weekend I attended a group art show opening in Melbourne and prices ranged from $450 to $2200 for some very nice original oil & watercolour paintings. If you can afford to live in the Bay area or most other large cities in the developed world, you can afford to occasionally pay that much for a painting.<p>(Most of the stuff churned out by the &quot;contemporary art&quot; scene can be safely ignored.

Moving the responsibility for linking/attesting a secret key to an ip address (and DNS name) to the DNS system is probably the more sane model - but it&#x27;s not really possible to do in a backwards-compatible way (such a system would be a <i>new</i> system).<p>The first thing we could/should do, is probably demand support for (sub)domain limits on CA certs. Eg one cert to sign CA certs for .com (but not eg: .cn) - and give each CA a limited cert for some subset of TLDs (preferably one for each). And remove the wildcart cert nonsense, and just give domain holders a CA cert for their domain.<p>[edit: And by demand, I mean that SSL clients such as Chrome and Thunderbird and Outlook and Safari... should treat &quot;unbounded&quot; CA certs as invalid. It would require a major overhaul. Also note that there are lots of broken clients (all of them?) that ignore limitations so any security <i>gain</i> wouldn&#x27;t be seen until all those were upgraded/phased out. It may indeed be more realistic/easier to move to a new/more secure system (ie: the &quot;www&quot; would be &quot;secure&quot; with a &quot;secure DNS with records for certs&quot;, but IMAP would remain broken)]<p>This would &quot;compartmentalize&quot; the trust somewhat, meaning that compromises would be more limited.<p>It would also allow us to move to a setting where the default is mistrust, rather than trust: make it <i>normal</i> that both certs and (intermediate) CA certs need to be rotated, say every month or so.<p>Certainly not perfect - but I&#x27;m not sure I trust the DNS system with encryption keys much more than the current CAs. So I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;securing&quot; DNS will really help - sure you could argue that SSL &quot;just&quot; binds a cert to a domain name -- but that isn&#x27;t really any meaningful level of trust either. The fact that DNS is insecure, and CAs can sign willy-nilly any domain is <i>bad</i>. I&#x27;m not convinced allowing eg. all Russian registrars of .com-domains to issue .com certs is <i>that</i> much of an improvement.",1446081824

Mask production company&#x27;s ownership and location should be in a country with low corruption that can&#x27;t compel secret backdoors.<p>4. Protect the transfer of the mask to the fab.<p>5. Protect the fab process, at least one set of production units, the same way as (3). Same security principles.<p>6. Protect the hand-off to the packaging companies.<p>7. Protect the packaging process. Same security principles as (3).<p>8. Protect the shipment to your customers.<p>9. Some of the above apply to PCB design, integration, testing, and shipment.<p>So, there you have it. It&#x27;s a bit easier than some people think in some ways. You don&#x27;t need to own a fab really. However, you do have to understand how mask making and fabbing are used, be able to observe that, have some control over how tooling/software are done, and so on. Plenty of parties and money involved in this. It will add cost to any project doing it which means few will (competitiveness).<p>I mainly see it as something funded by governments or private parties for increased assurance of sales to government and security-critical sectors. It will almost have to be subsidized by governments or private parties. My hardware guru cleverly suggested that a bunch of smaller governments (eg G-88) might do it as a differentiator and for their own use. Pool their resources.<p>It&#x27;s a large undertaking regardless. Far as specifics, I have a model for that and I know one other high-assurance engineer with one. Most people just do clever obfuscation tricks in their designs to detect modifications or brick the system upon their use with optional R.E. of samples. I don&#x27;t know those tricks and it&#x27;s too cat n mouse for me. I&#x27;m focused at fixing it at the source.<p>EDIT: I also did another essay tonight on cost of hardware engineering and ways to get it down for OSS hardware.

The barometer won&#x27;t help with your latitude or longitude usually, because you are correct: the pressure will be approximately equal in those dimensions when you are looking at such a small area.<p>The barometer is sensitive to altitude changes much much smaller than a meter, probably something like 0.1 meters. So if you are a person, with a smartphone, and you are in a tall building, the barometer can assist with determining which floor you&#x27;re on. Other sensors would need to be used for calibration (since the changes weather will affect the floor-level) and it doesn&#x27;t help with the x,y coordinates, just the z. But other location systems are now very very good at x,y and they mostly lack the z.<p>So by adding the high-accuracy relative altitude capabilities of the barometer to the existing x,y systems, you can get extremely precise locations.",1446080415

You are the one who did. And there is not even a guarantee that there&#x27;s money in this &quot;space&quot; either. Rather, this on-demand home-cleaning category is quite gloomy if you look at what&#x27;s happening to all the companies that belong to it. Maybe you think all &quot;opportunities&quot; are related to money, but to many entrepreneurs it&#x27;s just a secondary objective.",1446080413

Your discovery of false negatives doesn't say much about the filter quality in this respect.<p>If you could take random samples from the group of people who would apply to Haskell jobs and from people who would apply to Java jobs and come up with a measure of motivation/willingness-to-learn, I believe there would be some statistically significant things to say. Samples from two mainstream (and in my opinion, trashy) languages like C++ and VB might be harder to differentiate.<p>As a side note, I've noticed that companies that can afford a large amount of false negatives tend to have horrible interviewing practices. Google is in the top two of the worst interviewing experiences I've ever had. When everybody salivates over your company, you can afford use a quick and dirty filter that hones in on any one arbitrary characteristic. As a matter of fact, one could possibly argue that these lazy filters do better than more accurate filters in the same way that Google argues that more data is better than superior AI.

I think this is a good thing.<p>1-3: Comments that few people ever read are inherently less valuable to the vitality of the site than comments that many people read.<p>4: If people are encouraged to pick their battles rather than voicing their opinion any time they have a comment box in front of them, so much the better. It means less time wasted with the same stale arguments, and perhaps fewer one-sided submissions.<p>I concede that this relies on the fragile notion that people will be willing to acknowledge (by voting) when a comment they disagree with has merit, but I suspect this would be easier if people had more experience with higher-quality disagreement--say a 4, 5, or 6 on pg's hierarchy.<p>5: If a submission and thread was worth commenting in at all, it is presumably interesting enough to deserve the up voting.  Not a problem.<p>If people are discouraged from commenting on threads that they themselves do not find worth voting up, that's a good thing.<p>If a significant number of people start commenting on and voting up stories that they themselves don't find interesting--well, at that point I'd start fearing for the survival of the human race.<p>6-7: Well, duh.<p>8: See 1-3.

Last October my co-founder, Rian Gauvreau, and I launched Clio, a web-based practice management tool designed specifically for solos and small firm lawyers. We've been building buzz about it using word-of-mouth marketing, but wanted to step things up at a tradeshow and try to get the word out in the mainstream legal press and blogs.<p>The legal industry's biggest tradeshow, LegalTech New York, was the obvious place to do this - it just wrapped up yesterday. We wanted to attend the show and raise the visibility of Clio, which traditionally would be done by buying a booth, flying out 2-3 people to staff it up, buying some giveaways, etc. Renting the space for the booth alone would be $10k (just for a 10x10 booth), while buying a booth can easily be another $5-10k.<p>Looking at a $20k+ tab to have a booth at this show, we decided we should look at an alternative: just showing up at the conference with a laptop for demos, setting up meetings beforehand with e-mail, and leveraging Twitter to connect with existing and potential clients at the meeting (lawyers have a surprisingly vibrant presence on twitter - http://www.lextweet.com/).<p>The response? We spent 2 solid days answering DM's to set up meetings, even connected with giants in the field like Bob Ambrogi (@bobambrogi) via Twitter. It was easily the most positive and exciting tradeshow experience I've had, and we didn't spend a penny on the traditional booth, shwag and rental expenses. For any other HN startups out there: think twice before shelling out for an expensive booth to get the message out: you might be surprised at how effective Twitter can be as a marketing tool.<p>We blogged about this recently at http://www.goclio.com/blog/2009/02/05/ltny-wrap-up-how-twitter-changed-how-we-will-approach-tradeshows/. We're at http://twitter.com/goclio.<p>Would be interesting in hearing other experiences/opinions around tradeshows.",1233874856

I'm saying that if you've entered into agreements with other nations on the premise that you do something (in this case, protect and not steal IP) then you should honor those agreements.

I also don't think that Google should use espionage to steal secrets from Microsoft and vice versa, even if there is something to be gained.<p>One should also note that China is not some innocent bystander in this since Chinese companies have sought and obtained patents to stifle competition as well.  I also think the distinction made between ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries is not useful in this case.

Often the more expensive aged wine doesn't taste very good to someone who doesn't drink much wine because it's generally very dry.<p>There's also the matter of degrees.  Going from the $1 bottle to the $10 bottle is a huge jump in quality and taste.  Going from a <i>good</i> $10 bottle to the $50+ and the changes end up very subtle and not worth the money IMHO.

Selecting a random free dyno is fine with one router because you can guarantee that it is truly free.

This means that even with fixed-length response times, you get a dyno-queue-time of N*response_time under full load and some potential jitter even at low loads.  Add in huge variations of response time and this gets far worse since the queue length in time is unknown.

Most people do choose to care about it simply because it serves as a reasonable filter and this combined with social proof can reduce the problem of choice with minimum effort. People choose a certain ""class"" they want to represent and they just go along with whatever is on the menu for it.<p>But it's also important to notice that, while we all might be doing it to varying degrees, this does not necessarily apply to everything you do.

Everybody drinks a lot of wine, and there is an <i>insane</i> amount of variants to choose from. I know what I like when I taste it, but I know this applies to my personal taste only. Like the article says, it's not really possible to tell how expensive a wine is by tasting it. But that doesn't mean it all tastes the same. Wines are hugely diverse and everyone would be well-advised to just decide based on personal preference. However, high-profile wines are often designed to offend the least number of people, so they're an easy choice to serve when you're hosting a dinner - as a common denominator they do have a purpose.",1361198119

The only thing I can thing you might take issue with is consuming the model from the data sent from the server, but I couldn't explain why. This is still in keeping with the MVC pattern, which in no way prescribes that the data has to come directly from a database (or whatever else the server's model's state is formed by).<p>Or is the problem with the server's view not generating output that is necessarily HTML to be looked at, but data to be further consumed?

There also doesn't seem to be a clear goal here, other than to throw a bunch of money at some interesting questions.  The Genome Project had the very clear goal of mapping the human genome.  The European project aims to simulate a human brain.  This just seems to be directing a lot of money at research which is already being done.<p>That being said, I think there might be some very interesting opportunities here for talented developers.  When I worked in the field a few years ago, the software used for this stuff was generally a lot of MATLAB scripts with C subroutines held together by some scripting language duct tape (Python/Bash).  It was slow, it was buggy, we were basically writing documentation as we figured it out ourselves, different labs had different methods and scripts and in general it was kind of a mess.  It's actually bad enough that there are research grants out there to develop better analysis software.  Most of the researchers are trained in statistics, neuroscience, and psychology but have very little programming experience.  If you are interested in some of the software that is out there right now, below is a partial list.  Also, if you are interested in this kind of research but can't contribute code-wise, contact your local research university.  They are always looking for test subjects for this kind of stuff, you usually get paid pretty well ($50-100/hour for imaging studies) and you get some cool images of your own brain out of it if you ask.<p><a href=""http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</a><p><a href=""http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL</a><p><a href=""http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni"" rel=""nofollow"">http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni</a><p><a href=""http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</a><p><a href=""http://nipy.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nipy.sourceforge.net/</a><p><a href=""http://www.trackvis.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trackvis.org/</a>",1361197824

5238418,comment,5237947,5238172,9,0,jules,,,"That doesn't really have much to do with the expired link issue. That issue exists because the targets of links are stored as closures on the server. What you want is to serialize those closures into the URL itself, instead of letting the URL be a pointer to a closure stored on the server. In traditional web applications, you'd have to do that serialization manually (although if you've never used such a closure based web framework you might not even be aware that you're doing this, just like a C programmer who has never used a high level language might not consciously realize that he is implementing objects or closures or garbage collection manually -- or like an old Fortran programmer who is not aware that he is implementing recursion manually). The problem used to be much worse, but then PG did this transformation manually for the important subset of the site (most importantly for links to the comments section -- these links no longer expire).<p>Here's an example. Currently if you go to the home page and then click the ""More"" link at the bottom to go to the next page, and wait long enough, the more link expires. That's because it's currently implemented as something like this (not sure about ARC syntax, I'll use Scheme syntax here, but you get the idea):<p><pre><code>    (define (show-list-of-posts page-number)
      ... display the rest of the homepage ...
      (link ""More"" (lambda () (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 page-number)))))
</code></pre>
This stores the closure `(lambda () (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 page-number)))` with the free variable `page-number` in a hash table on the server. The URL becomes an index into that hash table. But the only information needed to reconstruct such a closure, is the function body and the free variables. So if we defined an auxilary function:<p><pre><code>    (define (foo page-number)
      (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 page-number)))
</code></pre>
then we could represent the closure as the pair (""foo"",page-number). If we encode that in the URL, then instead of looking up the closure from the hash table, we can reconstruct the closure on the fly. Hence we do no longer have to store anything on the server, and no links can expire anymore.<p>There are some challenges when you want to do this transformation automatically, but they can be overcome.",1361197799

Generally what happens is you take a group of subject, and get ""structural"" (anatomic) scans of their brain as well as the functional scans showing brain activity for the given task.  The structural scans are then run through a statistical ""normalization"" procedure, which basically does some fancy bending/warping of everyone's brains such that they all line up.  Once this is done you apply that normalization function to the functional scans so you can compare everyone.  It is also important to note that typically neuroimaging does not go down the neuronal level, the resolution is just not that high.  Typically you are looking for brain regions, or sub-regions that correlate with a given activity.  Something on the order of millimeters to centimeters.  However there are other ways of investigating brain activity, and some of those can go down to the neuronal level.<p>Here is an example of common software package to do such normalization and analysis: <a href=""http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</a>",1361196848

2. Handle faults while operating at scale with parallel routing
3. Providing correct statistical models for the situation. The one we have right now is a crude approximation.
4. Measuring on the real system for problems.<p>The optimum routing is to have each dyno with 0 or 1 job at a time and a global queue of all incoming requests. But this is a latency problem then since it takes time for a dyno to tell that it is ""ready"". The net result is very bad performance and the global queue is a single point of failure. The solution is to queue because this removes the latency --- but with the price you see RG paying if a Dyno can only serve one request at a time.<p>If a dyno does not report ""ready"" to the routing mesh, then you can't route optimally:<p>Queue length doesn't work since a request in queue may take 7000ms while still having a length of 1. Another queue with length 5 consisting of 5 70ms requests is better to route to.<p>The time the last request spent in queue is not useful either because the very next message may be a 7000ms one.<p>So to solve this problem, you must do something else. You cannot use ""intelligent routing"" unless you can describe how it will work distributed with, say, 8 routing machines while avoiding latency. And while you are at it, you better measure your solution in a real-world scenario.",1361196625

If it's only about getting rid of as much stuff as possible and spending as little as possible on everything, than it's more like asceticism than minimalism to me. Damn, let's just go back to caves, hunt for food and make own clothes!<p>I've read a lot of blogs about living minimally and one thing I've noticed is that most of the authors try hard to convince not the readers, but themselves that they're happy with that way of life. I don't buy that. To me minimalism was never about spending less money on things, just the opposite - spend more money, but on less stuff. In other words, quality over quantity. Spend money on stuff that makes you happy, be it travelling, sports cars or attending to as much concerts as possible. Money gives possibilities to experience things, and in my opinion it's what makes life interesting. I don't mind working hard to earn more money, so later I can experience more, without counting every penny. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot more important things in life that money can't buy, but it doesn't mean that money isn't essential to happiness. Just don't waste money on dull, unnecessary things, instead realise what really makes you happy and your life better and spend money on that.",1361196302

Do you accept that basis as an axiom for everything in your life or do you pick and choose whatever society has told you are the correct ones? Is your system of morality really based on the original foundation for that morality, or based on social convention?<p>If you believe your moral system is &quot;better&quot; than just following social convention and has a deeper basis, perhaps some kind of religion. Do you follow all the tenants of that religion or do you pick and choose from those? Why and why not?<p>If you&#x27;ve rejected that moral basis for some things, why haven&#x27;t you rejected it for all things?<p>If you are without a moral basis, what is the foundation you are using for your moral system? When you believe something is immoral, and somebody asks &quot;why?&quot; enough times, what is the answer?<p>Or have you arbitrarily just chosen some moral rules you think sound nice e.g. (don&#x27;t kill each other), and rejected others which you think don&#x27;t sound so nice e.g. (you must perform exactly these rituals, don&#x27;t mix fabrics). Why have you done this? What is your guiding principle?<p>If we don&#x27;t share the same basis for our moral systems, why should I follow your morals and you follow mine?",1412521193

It&#x27;s expensive; it&#x27;s hard to do without being detected and on a large scale it becomes almost impossible.<p>Furthermore, it is impossible to create a system that simultaneously lets you prove that your own vote was counted correctly AND prevents vote buying (where the buyer can verify you voted correctly). If you can verify your vote was counted, so can the vote buyer. If you can&#x27;t, you&#x27;re trusting the person running the (electronic) ballot box instead.<p>Bearing that in mind, any fair electronic open source voting system should absolutely NOT prevent people from verifying their own votes. The person running the ballot box software is inherently less trustworthy than the person casting the vote.<p>Let the police deal with vote buyers. They can set up stings and catch them easily. The voting <i>system</i> should be primarily protected against the people who are running it.",1412521063

That is, why should I protect say dolphins, if other dolphins make no effort to protect their own?<p>This means, for octopuses (octopi as a plural is incorrect; its Greek not Latin) its probably ok. They are born alone, are loners and meet others of their kind only to mate. So snack away!<p>I used dolphins in my example because of a curious behavior seen at an annual dolphin slaughter. The Japanese annually net dolphins in a bay where they like to congregate (the dolphins, not the Japanese).  Every year some dolphins escape the net.<p>The next year, the dolphins return en masse.  Why?  Didn&#x27;t the dolphins that escaped give some alarm - &quot;Aliens with catchy stringy things will entangle you and drag you up to the bright place if you go there!&quot;<p>No, they apparently don&#x27;t.

This works but is rather counterintuitive; with a Lisp-1 you get used to refering to functions directly rather than with a quoted symbol, but here we have to use both a quote and a #.</i><p>It is counterintuitive not because of Lisp-1 versus Lisp-2 but because in (def cdown countdown) the symbolic reference to the function countdown is immediately evaluated to an object that is bound to cdown, such that cdown doesn&#x27;t follow a redefinition of countdown. Yet, in (def cdown #&#x27;countdown), the #&#x27;countdown is deferred so that the countdown symbol is re-evaluated. This means that def has strange evaluation rules, or that #&#x27;countdown has nothing to do with the Common Lisp #&#x27;countdown: namely, it produces some kind of proxy object which resolves to a function, using late binding with a symbol that is captured in its innards. Or possibly #&#x27;countdown produces a wrapper function which takes the call and defers to countdown, by symbol.  That&#x27;s what is &quot;counterintuitive&quot;: that countdown and #&#x27;countdown do not evaluate to the same thing based on experiences with some other dialect.",1412520576

You do not need a clear definition of the goal for a method to help you approach the goal; you need a method that helps you approach the goal.<p>Suppose you say you&#x27;re practicing and teaching mathematics but you cannot tell me what mathematics is. How can I trust that you know anything about what you are teaching?<p>> I am also curious as why you believe meditation is not a way to solve problems in yourself. My personal, direct experience is that it does, so I have to conclude that your claim is false based on that alone, and to me this is also direct confirmation that your &quot;proof&quot; is nonsensical.<p>The burden of proof is on the person who says that something exists, not the person who says that they have not yet found evidence of the thing&#x27;s existence. If you have some evidence in your life quality that meditation has helped you, we should confirm what the concrete benefit is. No one can speak about what they do not know, and only those who do not know are silent in the face of a fair question. Over time, as I get to know you and see how you live, I get to confirm that if you cannot show proof of what you claim is inside you then it means you are telling untruth.<p>> Are you claiming this did not come from Gautama Buddha? Or are you claiming what it describes is not enlightenment? Or are you claiming it does not include meditation as one of the means? (&quot;right mindfulness, right concentration&quot; is what most people would consider to refer to meditation practice, and as far as I can tell it is well supported by other parts of the Pali canon that meditation is what this refers to). Or something else?<p>What I claim here is that there is a huge difference between the practice of meditation that people are learning and teaching in modern times, and the specifics of the method of self-reflection that Gautama Buddha guided his disciples to make efforts to undergo. However, I don&#x27;t know you yet, and it would be a mistake of mine to share his real teaching with you if I don&#x27;t confirm how genuine you are.<p>> If you mean that he did not describe it as sufficient by itself to attain enlightenment, then I believe you are right about what he said. Then again, I think a substantial proportion of people who find buddhist philosophy interesting does not believe in nirvana. When I meditation, it is not with that as a goal.<p>To be clear, no, I do not mean that meditation is not sufficient by itself. I mean that meditation is not something that makes you closer to Enlightenment. Enlightenment has very strict preconditions and meditation is not a teaching that you can practice which helps you fulfill those conditions.<p>Your usage of the term &#x27;nirvana&#x27; is interesting. I would like to mention to you that the term &#x27;nirvana&#x27; is only misunderstood by modern Buddhists to mean &#x27;cessation of rebirth&#x27;. If Buddha taught &#x27;cessation of rebirth&#x27; then he was teaching the way that people can die forever. However, that is not what a Buddha teaches people. He taught people to save themselves and to live well. He taught how to bless your endless future lives through what exists in reality. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a big difference between the upward socioeconomic mobility of someone who learned Buddha&#x27;s teachings correctly versus someone who didn&#x27;t. However, a big problem is the fact that it&#x27;s impossible for people who are untruthful to understand Buddha&#x27;s teaching. They cannot recognize it due to their lack of virtue and they discard it easily. So I would like to see how you respond before telling you more.",1412520351

The name of zen alludes to this, and Watts&#x27; translation of chan/dhyuna as emptiness rather then meditation is unusual. Zen emerged in response to certain schools of bhudhism which put emphasis on making offerings and gaining merit over meditation. So in some respects it was de-empasizing religious ritual as the article alludes (though I feel authentic zen is very much a religion, albeit without a creator), but this was to put the emphasis back on meditation. Watts&#x27; de-emphasis of zazen in zen is therfore quite ironic. \nTo do zen, set some time aside each day to sit in a dignified pasture and place your awareness on your breath. As your mind wanders, notice this and bring your attention back to your breath. Repeat a hundred thousand times. Over time, the emptiness of these thoughts becomes apparent and your attachment to them weakens. But, don&#x27;t attach to this emptiness either.",1412520245

I am not actually sure that this is a bad default behavior.

8412322,comment,8411762,8412256,1,0,vidarh,,,"> But meditation is not the way to solve problems in yourself and it is therefore not a way to learn the art of living.  The proof is that there is no clear definition of what life is through anyone who teaches meditation.<p>That&#x27;s not a proof of anything. You do not need a clear definition of the goal for a method to help you approach the goal; you need a method that helps you approach the goal.<p>I am also curious as why you believe meditation is not a way to solve problems in yourself. My personal, direct experience is that it does, so I have to conclude that your claim is false based on that alone, and to me this is also direct confirmation that your &quot;proof&quot; is nonsensical.<p>> And I think it will be important for you to know that Gautama Buddha did not teach that meditation is the way to attain an Enlightenment.<p>What is your basis for this claim? And what are you saying?<p>This is from the Nagara Sutta [1] (the last two paragraphs, describing the Noble Eightfold Path):<p>> &quot;In the same way I saw an ancient path, an ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times. And what is that ancient path, that ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. That is the ancient path, the ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times. I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of aging & death, direct knowledge of the origination of aging & death, direct knowledge of the cessation of aging & death, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging & death. I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of birth... becoming... clinging... craving... feeling... contact... the six sense media... name-&-form... consciousness, direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness, direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness. I followed that path.<p>> &quot;Following it, I came to direct knowledge of fabrications, direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications, direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabrications. Knowing that directly, I have revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay followers & female lay followers, so that this holy life has become powerful, rich, detailed, well-populated, wide-spread, proclaimed among celestial & human beings.&quot;<p>Are you claiming this did not come from Gautama Buddha? Or are you claiming what it describes is not enlightenment? Or are you claiming it does not include meditation as one of the means? (&quot;right mindfulness, right concentration&quot; is what most people would consider to refer to meditation practice, and as far as I can tell it is well supported by other parts of the Pali canon that meditation is what this refers to). Or something else?<p>If you mean that he did not describe it as <i>sufficient by itself</i> to attain enlightenment, then I believe you are right about what he said. Then again, I think a substantial proportion of people who find buddhist philosophy interesting does not believe in nirvana. When I meditation, it is not with that as a goal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.065.than.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.065.tha...</a>",1412519096

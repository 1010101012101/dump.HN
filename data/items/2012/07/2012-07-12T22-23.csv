4237282,comment,4234117,4237211,2,0,pbiggar,,,"So I'm not involved in the current discussion, but I remember some stuff from the last discussion and in general.<p>To start, you can consider the problem of type checking of scalars in a language with implicit type coercions. You're supposed to be able to treat 0 and 0.0 the same. At the same time, if you have a type check that says ""int"", you kinda expect to get an int. So ""with cast"" does that.<p>I know a lot of people find that ugly, and that you want to strictly that you must receive an int, but that's just not how people use PHP, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the language. As an example, you want to be able to add type checks to all the functions in the standard library, many of whom treat null, ""0"", 0 and 0.0 to be the same.<p>For PHP specifically, there is the additional consideration that PHP is supposed to be a newbie friendly language. There was a perception in the PHP internals community that newbie developers could not wrap their head around the concept of ""types"". I've heard people say that a developer shouldn't be required to think about what types his variable might hold. Clearly this is lunacy for many reasons, but there it is.",1342133640

This is sometimes called 8b/10b encoding since you get 8 bits delivered out of 10 bits sent. In packet systems (like ethernet) it gets a bit weirder since you might have 1500 bytes of data (represented by 15,000 bauds) but you add 36 bytes of network header information (another 360 bauds)) 1500 bytes is now 15,360 bauds [1].<p>The biggest challenge of shipping drives around though is that hard drives are really really cranky about g-shock so you can easily destroy all of your data if you drop, or even suddenly bang your drive as you are moving it around.<p>I think it was mostly interesting from the perspective of someone who isn't used to dealing with large data sets suddenly having that 'ah ha' moment when confronted with the challenges of managing data with consequences.<p>[1] This is nominally incorrect since the protocol layer overhead isn't 'bauds' like the physical access layer which uses the term strictly for signalling structures, but it works well for this example.",1342133333

It cares more about manipulating existing text than creating new text, and so it tries its best to let you make changes without just deleting and re-typing from scratch, or using your mouse to point and click and drag and highlight.<p>It has a steep learning curve so it's initially hard to adapt not just to this change in perspective, but also to the commands and shortcuts that allow you to be more efficient and productive.<p>Such is the investment of time and effort required to do be good in it, you might consider grokking Vim a commitment as big as grokking your programming language of choice. However,  you will in return acquire a life-long knowledge of working in Vim, and using it will become second-nature and infinitely preferable to manipulating text by hand.<p>As a developer, knowledge of Vim is valuable because of two things:<p>1. Portable configuration: what you learn, and how you personalise your editor, is transferrable to other machines, as it's just text. No modern editor has adequately replicated such basic functionality.<p>2. Ubiquity: you can't load Sublime Text, Textmate, Eclipse, {$gui_editor} on the VPS you routinely SSH into.

In descending order: intuitive, consistent, modular, comfortable, portable.<p>Intuitive: most commands resemble natural language, without awkward or arbitrary mappings. For instance:<p>- w: (forward) word;<p>- cw: change  (forward) word;<p>- c2w: change 2  (forward) words;<p>- 2cw: twice change word;<p>- ciw: change inner word;<p>There is no intervening translation. For instance, to change a word in mainstream editors, you delete it first, then start entering the new text. In Vim, it's one command: you think ""change forward word"", you issue the ""change forward word"" command.<p>Consistent. For instance, double letters work on lines:<p>- cc: change <i>line</i>;<p>- dd: delete <i>line</i>;<p>- yy: yank <i>line</i>;<p>and capital letters work till the end of the line:<p>- C: change <i>till the end of the line</i>;<p>- D: delete <i>till the end of the line</i>;<p>- Y: yank <i>till the end of the line</i> (not so in vanilla Vim, but I've remapped it because consistency matters to me).<p>Modular: you compose commands. For instance, / is the search command and then:<p>- d/testo: delete until the next occurrence of ""testo"";<p>- c/testo: change until the next occurrence of ""testo"";<p>- etc.<p>Comfortable: limited usage of modifier keys. Vim saved me from RSI.<p>Portable: letters and Shift keys are in the same position on <i>any</i> keyboard, be it on a desktop, a laptop, etc.  whilst each laptop manufactures has its own idea about where Control, Alt, Arrows, PageUp and PageDown should be.<p>Hope this helps.",1342132317

4237169,comment,4235443,4236270,2,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"It's somewhat amusing to me to see several comments on this thread wave away the actual hardware as an ""outsourced design"" or ""just call Asus"". I have to assume it's a result of people not understanding the complexity of modern hardware.<p>First, I've been unable in my (admittedly, cursory) research to discover any prebuilt systems that even come close to their promised hardware specs. So until someone proves me wrong by posting a link to an OTS solution even close to what they're promising, lets assume that the system needs custom design.<p>This is a whole massive can of worms. I have some experience with hardware design (though not as much as a full-blown EE), and I'd ballpark hardware design alone as a half-year effort with multiple full-time EEs. And that's a best-case optimistic estimate. People who work in software don't seem to understand how <i>hard</i> this stuff is. It's not like you can simply take another schematic, slap the new parts you want on, delete the old parts, autoroute it and call it a day. With parts of this complexity there's a whole host of other design issues that come out of the woodwork. High-frequency switching means if one of your autorouted traces is longer than another, you're going to have timing issues. Crosstalk between layers, capacitance and inductance of the wires themselves can wreak havoc on your busses. You need to intelligently design the ground planes, separate your signals (analog and digital components), etc etc etc.<p>These are only the issues I'm aware of. I'm sure people experienced with creating boards this complex can fill me in on more. It's not like a hobby arduino project - <i>hooking up traces</i> to debug problems can increase the capacitance of a line enough to cause a new set of problems.<p>This isn't really directed just towards you, but it feels like a ton of people here are missing how difficult hardware design with components this complex is.",1342131893

When people talk about Windows, they're talking about 5-year-old beater Inspirons or 16-character HP one-of-three-hundred-identical-laptops-with-different-model-numbers-of-the-week, not EliteBooks, and almost certainly not ThinkPads. When people talk about Macs, they're talking about the Macbook Air, Macbook Pro, or <i>maybe</i> Mac Mini.<p>As far as software, as someone who supports Windows 7 on a daily basis: I have never spent more than 5 minutes on network printing with Macs. I have rarely spent less than three hours on network printing with Windows. Let's talk about the fact that it's 2012 and when I right-click a printer, I get to choose ""printing preferences,"" ""printer properties,"" and ""properties."" It may seem silly, but this stuff <i>matters</i>. You shouldn't have to hire the neighbor kid just to use your printer.<p>Additionally, manufacturers override Microsoft's decent (if clunky) WiFi interface and force you to use poorly designed taskbar-based apps, to the point where smart but non-tech-savvy people can't figure out how to connect to the Internet at a coffee shop.

What the hell gives you the right to open a dialog over my work just because I plugged in an ethernet cable?). On my Mac I go to the Airport dropdown next to the volume control, pick from the available SSIDs, and it's done. Ethernet silently gets DHCP and connects. Details are there if I want them in ipconfig and System Preferences, but I hardly ever do. There certainly isn't crap in my taskbar running stupid 3fps animations and demanding my attention every few minutes. I have never been startled by the audio ""Virus database has been updated"" coming out of nowhere on a Mac, but this was a daily occurrence for Avast users.<p>How about ""Windows is checking for a solution to the problem""? How about UAC dialogs that silently open <i>behind</i> my current window, so my Install Wizard appears to hang when it's actually just waiting for me to click ok?<p>Full screen is not basically like Maximize; Maximize is basically like Maximize.

The piracy demographic is usually limited to two groups- people who believe they are beating the system, and people who don't know they're hurting the system.<p>I think the attitude of the company plays a big role.  For instance, music companies won't fund music unless it is guaranteed to produce insane profits.  If people know that the company is offering good services at intentionally fair prices, they will be more willing to not cheat the system.<p>Look at Louis C.K.:
I'm a huge fan of him so I would have bought anyway, but since he cut the cost down to $5, I think many people bought simply because they believed the price was worth the content.<p>I think piracy is a result of a disconnect between users and creators.  The more middle men there are, the less people will care about the people involved.  When the writer is appealing to you that hey, please don't steal from me, more people will have a heart about it.",1342130750

A couple of things (1) Based on our experience, we ran into a lot of empirical evidence that parents don't take the lead in talking to their kids about what they might run into on the Internet (2) The pro-choice argument works well for teens who are well aware of whats out there. Our intent is to protect younger children who might be accidentally exposed to adult content before their parents have had a chance to talk to them about it (or are too young to visit these sites even after such a discussion). Incidentally, the trigger for this idea was when my co-founder saw his 6-year old cousin accidentally viewing an age-inappropriate video on YouTube on an iPad while his parents were away. That's when we looked for solutions for ""safe YouTube"" out there and were surprised to see how sorry the parental ""control"" solutions out there were.",1342130589

The ranking algorithm on Digg was blatantly rigged to produce a front page with mass-market appeal. Overly nerdy or political submissions rarely made the cut. I suspect that, early on, Digg's leadership decided that allowing users too much control over content would keep Digg in a nerd/leftist niche that couldn't be monetized. A lack of respect for democratic control over the front page ultimately led them to ignore voting rings, gaming, and spammers; and eventually justified handing over control to the marketeers and content farms in Digg v4.",1342130530

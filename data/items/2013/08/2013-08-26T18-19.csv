6279112,comment,6275479,6278677,1,0,lambda,,,"> It doesn&#x27;t matter what you use it for. Encrypted passwords are simply not a strong enough single factor to prevent a successful attack. If you use FDE you should also be using a keyfob, thumb drive, etc. There&#x27;s too many attacks on passwords alone, for example the most effective one, where the police compel you to reveal it. (Compelling you to reveal the location of a keyfob is arguably more difficult for them to do)<p>Security is not an absolute. There are plenty of attacks where a strong password & strong key derivation function for FDE will prevent many possible attacks. It helps plug the improperly erased discarded hard drives hole, the thief on the train who steals your laptop opportunistically looks through your data for anything valuable.<p>Yes, two factor is better, but it increases the complexity; and for many cases in which you want FDE, such as a laptop while travelling, there are far too many times where you keyfob and laptop will both be accessible to an attacker, thus negating the benefit of the separate factors.<p>It&#x27;s better to have a good password and good KDF for FDE than it is to forgo FDE altogether.<p>> To be honest, I find it completely useless to hypothesize about why someone would attack a system, much less for something as silly as shared passwords. It&#x27;s much less work to just attack the one account on the one system than to attack two completely different systems on the hope that the password is shared. And botherding/phishing to compromise accounts is much more simple & effective than trying to compromise a password database.<p>No, on an industry-wide scale it is not useless to hypothesize about motivations. If you decrease the expected value of an attack, you decrease the motivation for people to break into systems. Getting credit card numbers and easily cracked passwords out of databases that are accessible to front-end systems does a lot to help reduce the expected value of attacks, and thus reduce people&#x27;s motivation to perform them in the first place.<p>Thus, recommendations for security should keep that in mind. If you make good, easy to implement recommendations for security, that help reduce the value of a successful attack, you can improve global security. For example, token based systems can help avoid credit cards being stolen; instead of each merchant storing CC numbers, if they store tokens that are only valid for them talking to their CC processor, then there&#x27;s no valuable trove of CC numbers to be found by exploiting the database.<p>There&#x27;s this really dangerous meme going around that if security isn&#x27;t absolute it&#x27;s worthless. That can be true if you assume a highly motivated attacker with government level resources at their disposal who is targeting you specifically, but that&#x27;s not the attacker that actually causes most people problems. Instead, it&#x27;s some bored Eastern European kid who doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of job prospects and wants to make a quick buck, and figures that trying out some basic SQL inject exploits against a large number of sites will be likely to lead to some valuable information. If enough people remove that valuable information from their site or make it difficult enough to extract the contents by using good key derivation functions, there&#x27;s less economic incentive to try that kind of wide-scale probing attack.<p>This is part of the principle of defense in depth. You are absolutely right, you should secure your password database so that it can&#x27;t be stolen, and you should protect passwords in flight so that they can&#x27;t be sniffed. But you should also have good, hard to break password encryption, so that even if you made a mistake and are vulnerable at that outer layer, your users are still protected from having their passwords revealed to attackers. Likewise, you should have both a firewall, and intrusion detection systems that live behind your firewall, and strong authentication and encryption for all services behind that firewall so that even if someone circumvents the firewall, they still can&#x27;t get into any of your systems.<p>So yes. Prevent your password database from being stolen. Use strong passwords. Don&#x27;t reuse passwords between sites. But also, use strong password hashing that&#x27;s hard to crack so that your users are still secure even if all of the above suggestions fail.",1377543349

In the case of &quot;memory pressure&quot; you can think of this as the GC having to scan the graph of references way more often than it really needs to.

We operate independently of companies and choose winners based on hour things-- Completeness, Impactfulness, Technical difficulty, and viability. We had some issues in our early days with pre-done code, so now all winning teams are subject to code reviews after winning (and in the case where the review shows previous work has been done, we contact the second place winner and invite them to our finals event instead. We do this discretely as to not shame the initial winner who sometimes may not have understood the rules). I&#x27;d say this happens 5% of the time, so this is very much the exception and not the rule.<p>I started AngelHack so that people could have a shot of getting exposure for their ideas and support in taking them to the next level. We welcome everyone to our events, startups who want a good environment to team build and work on new things to indie-devs looking for an outlet from their typically work week. Normally, great coders win and great ideas come out of it. Our mission from there to provide support and mentorship, so top teams have a fighting chance at turning their hack into a startup. Many companies raise funding after they win our events and we&#x27;re proud of that. They literally start at our events and now they are in YC, TechStars, AngelPad, and you name it. That&#x27;s cool. With 35 cities happening concurrently, sometimes the quality of what judges pick can vary, where even I myself have had WTF moments on who won, but the majority of our judges pick solid winners and if I see something was really awesome, I&#x27;ll still invite that team into our finals, regardless of what the judges choose.<p>My take on corporate hackathons -- most award winners based on who has spent the most time digging into the API and asking good questions to the company -- these would be teams who helped them improve their product and teams that they&#x27;d like to believe will finish their product so they can showcase it on their app-store// dev-site. Again, I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but that&#x27;s the trend I see.<p>And for Startup Weekend, they don&#x27;t throw hackathons. They do a business plan event, where they don&#x27;t really care what comes in or comes out. It&#x27;s about uniting the community and doing customer development on ideas. They judge based on who they feel has improved and who makes the the crowd happy. It&#x27;s not really a competition.<p>All this said, I&#x27;m curious what people think hackathons should be judged on. Imagine you were giving away $10,000 -- how would you decide? Would you do it on what&#x27;s cool, based solely on the tech, based on what could make revenue, based on the teams passion for what they are doing? Solve that, and AngelHack would gladly integrate it in with our events worldwide. Again, currently we judge based on Completeness, Impactfulness, Technical difficulty, and viability.",1377542764

It would be useful for them to do so, the images have been stored in the past, and the announcements don&#x27;t mention storage, only display.<p>(For those unfamiliar: High-res versions have to be taken, they definitely do exist. The vague images the TSA personal see are the result of the original images being run through ATD (sometimes called ATR or AID) filters that boil the original image down to the important parts.)<p>Storing the original high-res versions would probably be fantastically useful. It would provide a good data source for real-world benchmarks and operational feedback for L3, but most enticingly it would provide an audit trail for post-incident analysis so investigators could re-examine the scanned data for a targeted individual.<p>Given that this is the age where, by default, we store everything and analyze it later, people did talk about storing the images, even if it was entirely low key. It&#x27;s just too obviously useful.<p>I was looking into this recently, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything about the new L3 ATD machines that mentioned whether the images are stored. The parent comment&#x27;s links say nothing about it and I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that did, including the L3 ProVision ATD product page[1].<p>It certainly seems strongly <i>implied</i> that the images are not stored. We read phrases from L3 like &quot;processed by software without human intervention&quot;, but that sounds somewhat suspiciously specific. OK, no one is <i>definitely</i> and <i>actively</i> looking at it, but what about <i>potentially</i> and <i>passively</i>? Is it just bad wording on their part, or is someone actually trying to leave a loophole?<p>If they&#x27;re going to scan us in a way we feel is invasive, is it too much to get some sort of assurance that the images are being handled properly? Frankly, an audit of the machines would be more than in proper order, given that it&#x27;s handling sensitive data that needs to be carefully handled.<p>Can anyone point out something I&#x27;ve missed? Is there anything that talks about image storage, not just display?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.sds.l-3com.com/advancedimaging/provision-at.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sds.l-3com.com/advancedimaging/provision-at.htm</a>",1377542681

For major medical and certain supplemental health like dental, there is a load for small groups, but it isn&#x27;t very much. The risk is certainly higher, but one large claim can make a group&#x27;s loss ratio beyond what can be recovered, so the additional premium has to be spread across the small group category. The biggest factor which is often overlooked is that the insured is &quot;actively at work&quot; which lowers the potential risk, because working people are healthier and the insurance company can add underwriting factors for certain industries.  Another thing to note is even if you are allowed to select a voluntary product like dental or health indemnity product, there is little or no choice on the specific riders or benefit amounts which lowers the &quot;anti-selection&quot; for riders. Products that are partially employer-paid like major med and/or a group&#x27;s participation percentage being high also limits the potential anti-selection.

The entire freaking point of the insurance company is that they are pooling money from a bunch of people over time in the form of premiums to be able to distribute to a minority who need it in emergencies.<p>Good question. The answer is that the insurance companies know that people are self-selecting if they buy insurance on their own, while (to a good approximation) they do not select jobs on the basis of the insurance that they will get from it. So insurance offered through an employer comes from a pool of typical people with a certain age and wealth distribution, while insurance sold directly to consumers comes from a pool of people who think that they need that particular kind of insurance. Needless to say, the risk is MUCH higher with the individual policies, and it is priced accordingly.",1377541721

Let me explain...<p>I&#x27;m developing a game in the evenings & weekends. I do not have to go to all the local business networking groups to find some SaaS problem to develop into a solution for B2B sales. I don&#x27;t have to poll everyone I meet about my new social local mobile wotsit to figure out my B2C sales. I don&#x27;t have to <i>look</i> for a problem. The &quot;normal&quot; people I know who have computer problems have problems that are solved through education or using a comprehensively better toolset: both solutions are not wanted solutions.  My &quot;awesome app&quot; ideas would generally take years to develop and may not even be wanted. Remember, people like & usually want what&#x27;s familiar (faster horse, etc).  Games, on the other hand offer a simple business model: entertainment. If it&#x27;s catchy and entertainy enough, you wind up making some money; if you really get lucky and the game is smooth enough, you make lots of it.<p>All that said: The probability of my game making &#x27;f u&#x27; money is, loosely, nil. What I&#x27;d like to be able to do is make rent money; what I&#x27;ll probably do is make beer money... for one six-pack of microbrews. :-)<p>The big problem with solving &quot;hard problems&quot; is that they are (1) time consuming (aka expensive) and (2) often they are solved in an ad-hoc fashion already which makes the switchover brutally difficult or (3) there is simply not the infrastructure to support your solution. If you&#x27;ve done enterprise development, you&#x27;ll have a glimpse of the grief involved with simple problems on a complex domain.<p>Given the above, games seems like a low-reward low-risk way to make some cash (to me).",1377540957

out the baby with the bathwater.  Passing
up a great opportunity.<p>Review:  Windows 7 desktops remain important
for people running high end applications from
AutoCad, Adobe, Mathematica, Office, etc.  Also
developers for code to run on Windows Server
or in house Windows 7 desktop applications.<p>There are many client devices with many more
to come.<p>The client devices need the Internet and
servers, and as concerns about security
increase clients should just cache data,
easy to erase quickly in case the
device falls into other hands,
and not store the data; servers need to be
very secure; and many organizations 
and individuals will
want their data on their servers in their
physical space protected by the Fourth
Amendment.<p>Shrink wrapped software?  Okay, have a nice
application and want to write it for 
sales, installation, support, and usage
on all the different client devices, Windows
XP, Vista, 7, 8, smart phones, tablets?  Heck
no.  And, for Windows 7, etc. a user is
very reluctant just to install a shrink
wrapped application due to issues of
system security and stability.  So, the
shrink wrapped business is in deep trouble
except for the big applications from
AutoCad, Adobe, Mathematica, etc.<p>So, what to do about the work of 
shrink wrapped applications?  Sure:
Make them Web apps; that is, use
a Web browser for the user interface;
let the browser run on whatever client;
and put the rest of the code on a server.
If the client can&#x27;t run a good Web browser,
then do the same thing by writing 
a client app that uses a Web server for
the data, algorithms, and computation.<p>So, we&#x27;ve got it:  For Microsoft, push
Windows Server for the servers.  Push
client devices.  Have really good Web
browsers.  And in cases where <i>own
both ends of the wire</i>, take advantage
of that for more in functionality.<p>Fundamental point:  People using 
devices, including mobile, want some
<i>utility</i>, <i>functionality</i>, etc.
Since a single mobile device is quite limited
in what it can do, the device is mostly
for user interface (UI) for
services, applications, algorithms, data,
etc. on servers.  So, the servers remain
just crucial.<p>Microsoft has shown that it knows how to
run huge server farms, well managed,
with minimal staff.  That&#x27;s a huge
business advantage.  Computing is
charging on; e.g., there is a new solid
state mass memory that can put a terabyte
on the area of a postage stamp.  It&#x27;s been
a while since Intel knew how to put
1000 cores on a single processor.  New
operating system concepts will be coming
forward.  All this progress will need
lots of software development, e.g., for
servers.  Microsoft&#x27;s got the people,
funds, market, etc. to do that work and
lead in it.<p>Mistake:  Dunkin Donuts sells more donuts
than Windows sells copies of Windows 8.
Similarly for hamburgers at McDonald&#x27;s.
Similarly for smart phones from Apple.
And, for all three cases, so what for
Microsoft?  There may be a lot of new
client devices, but that does not mean
that Microsoft has to dominate in all of them.<p>All the smart phones in the world won&#x27;t
mean that a high end, 64 bit Windows 7
desktop system will be of no interest;
a smartphone and a high end Windows
7 desktop just are not the same thing
and are not really in direct competition;
even more the case for Windows Server.<p>Breakup?  Windows Server can&#x27;t exist
alone and, instead, must <i>serve</i> the
many client devices.  So, Microsoft
should stay in the business of 
soft/hardware for some client devices.
So, don&#x27;t breakup.",1377540921

Yes.<p>No.<p>I haven&#x27;t met a single person who works 60 hours a week and is thrilled about it, outside of those who work for themselves. When you work for yourself, yes, it&#x27;s definitely possible. That&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about.<p>On top of everything, we&#x27;re primarily talking about <i>young</i> people. A <i>young</i> person needs to invest a lot more time into their non-work life. Relationships, friends, acquiring property, family, hobbies, sports, etc. I can go on.

Insurance companies design their policies to get more out of you then you get out of them, and they&#x27;ve gotten very good at figuring out ways to deny benefits to people.<p>Just give me the money in my paycheck and let me do with it as I see fit. The money I would spend on insurance I put into a personal savings account. I insure myself.<p>I spent $1200 <i>total</i> on health care costs in the last 3 years. Now that Obamacare requires I buy insurance or else get hit with a penalty, I&#x27;m going to be spending a lot more than that every year.<p>Why should it be cheaper to have group policies through employers? The entire freaking point of the insurance company is that they are pooling money from a bunch of people over time in the form of premiums to be able to distribute to a minority who need it in emergencies. It&#x27;s already a paramutual arrangement, why do we have to obfuscate it with employer group policies?<p>Insurance, at least as it is done in the US, is a scam. It is an oligarchy designed to keep medical services prices high so they can justify outlandish premiums as merely just a small percentage margin.",1377540087

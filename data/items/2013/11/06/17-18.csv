6684082,comment,6678186,6679573,1,0,gautamnarula,,,"The system works for the top players, but I think once you move below the elite rank the rankings aren&#x27;t really accurate. I think the system is arbitrary for a few reasons:<p>1) The number of points awarded for tournament performance seems pretty arbitrary. For instance, winning a grand slam results in 2000 points, while coming in second is worth 1200 points and coming in third/fourth is worth 720 points [1]. Is coming in second really only 60% as good as coming in first? It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s some deep, evidence-based rationale behind picking these precise values.<p>2) The tournament hierarchy is also arbitrary. A win at a Grand Slam is worth 2000 points, while winning gold in the Olympics is worth 750 points [1]. Why? Shouldn&#x27;t the points awarded be based purely on the strength of your competition?<p>There are other issues, such as rewarding someone who plays a ton of tournaments with mediocre performances, versus someone who plays less often but with better results (though this is somewhat offset with the difference in points awarded based on performance). I&#x27;ve had friends complain about similar systems in video games-- apparently in Halo the top rung of players is full of mediocre players who play a lot, racking up points in the process and moving up the ranks.<p>Since tennis doesn&#x27;t have a concept of &quot;World Champion,&quot; I think the sport would be better served to switch to the Elo system like chess. It provides an accurate comparison of relative player strengths, it does a decent job dealing with the plays a lot vs. better results problem, and it functions exactly the same regardless of the tournament you play in-- you only get more points if you perform better or play stronger opponents. Another interesting tidbit is that it gives you a statistical probability of any player beating any other, which isn&#x27;t possible under the ATP system.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_ranking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_ranking</a><p>Edit: One other problem with ATP points--since most tennis tournaments are knockout (as opposed to swiss pairings used in chess tournaments [2]) the only thing you know for sure is that the winner as the best player in the tournament, assuming tennis results are transitive (a big assumption). But if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to be in the knockout branch that features the best player, you could be knocked out earlier than your would otherwise merit, which means you could get far less points than you deserve.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_pairings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_pairings</a>",1383760560

6684074,comment,6682324,6682324,7,0,tedivm,,,"I could write pages about managing CDNs, but unfortunately have to run. As an abbreviated version, Malwarebytes (company I work for) balances several CDNs around the globe to try to get the best performance possible (as well as to deal with some security issues inherent to hosting an antimalware tool). We have relationships with quite a few (not all of those relationships positive).<p>In my opinion this article skipped two of the best CDN&#x27;s around, Edgecast and Highwinds. Edgecast in particular is damn fast (ssd boxes, high ram, most stuff served from memory). We&#x27;re running multiple SSL&#x27;d domains through them without issue. Highwinds is more of an up and comer, but they have amazing service (as long as you avoid using them in South America).<p>The reason I avoid Cloudfront (AWS) is that it&#x27;s way to expensive. I avoid CloudFlare because of the interactions I&#x27;ve had with their security team and CEO.<p>MaxCDN is good as long as you have no plans to go global. Let me be very explicit about this- if your CDN doesn&#x27;t have a POP in Australia then they&#x27;re not ready for prime time. There are only a few fiber lines going into the country and performance is absolute crap if you aren&#x27;t hosting your files there. They also have nothing in South America, the MidEast or Africa.<p>As a seperate note, most DNS management companies will offer DNS based &quot;CDN Managers&quot;, which will allow you to set priority rules for each CDN by region. This is an amazing tool that allows you to really take control of your traffic. I&#x27;ve never seen a CDN that was perfect everywhere, and when you have to deal with things like China (who don&#x27;t really allow external CDN&#x27;s in, forcing you to use one of theirs or host traffic out of Hong Kong) it&#x27;s a life saver. I know that Edgecast, Dyn and UltraDNS offer these types of services (with the Edgecast one being the cheapest by far).",1383760514

Just because something is legal doesn&#x27;t make it ethical.<p>Then, we know legalizing certain drugs will only move traffic to worse drugs. Legalize marijuana and dealers will move more crack, just like the mafia moved from alcohol to cocaine after they lifted the prohibition in the US. Now what, the government will legalize crack too? Make even more unethical businesses operate under the law, knowing these products will be abused by teenagers just like alcohol and tobacco today?<p>There&#x27;s no easy solution, and no one is addressing the real issue: that substance abuse is cultural and heavily promoted.

The law itself, in too many cases, offers too much ambiguity.<p>We want states to have the right to do things their own way on issues we want, but not on issues we don&#x27;t.  If we, as people, support the right of gay marriage, we think that states should be required to allow it.  However, if we support marijuana is relatively harmless, we think that states should be allowed to legalize it.<p>These are just examples, but it&#x27;s hard to come up with a &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; solution for what is or isn&#x27;t just.  If justice is based on morality, then whose morality do we base it on?  If it&#x27;s based on whether or not it causes harm to others, then what level of harm do we allow?  Freedom of speech is generally harmless, except when it isn&#x27;t -- except when it&#x27;s &quot;fire&quot; in a theater, or when it&#x27;s your neighbors yelling at 3 am, or when it&#x27;s someone preaching [religion/anti-religion] in contrast to what I want to hear.<p>In short, it&#x27;s a <i>very</i> complicated thing, justice, with blurry edges, multiple middles, and an infinite list of value substitutions that muddy the issue.

Basically any planet whose orbit from our perspective looks like an oval rather than a left-right wobble will not be observed by current methods which check for light flickers as the planets cross their star. There are complex factors at work here, but I&#x27;d think a reasonable approximation would be that solar systems plane of rotation are oriented randomly.<p>So, given random rotation, if we would expect to observe 1 out of 100 plants using this method and then find that there are planets around 1 out of 200, we can extrapolate that (1/100)/(1/200)= 1/2 of suns have planets. That explains the discrepancy anyway; since so many don&#x27;t rotate in the right plane the fact that we observe them at the frequency we do, rare as it is, means they are in fact quite common.

When you are the smartest in the room, you can get away with 40 hours because what you produce in 40 hours will be orders of magnitude ahead of what a normal guy produces in 80 hours. Trouble comes when you start being part of super smart teams (mine has about 9 engineers sharing around 150 years of systems/db building expertise amongst them). Here 40 hours gets you only to the &#x27;achieved level&#x27;. For some people this is not good enough, especially if they come from a continuous string of &#x27;excelled levels&#x27;.<p>2. I am not paid to do 40 hours of work. I am paid to get things done. Some things are automatable (which we do) but a lot of things require NLP and is hard to automate. These we do manually. They add up.<p>3. It is VERY hard to hire good senior engineers. My company (Amazon) pays a ton of money, has offices in great cities but still we find hiring hard. This means you won&#x27;t be offloading a bunch of those anytime soon and to be competitive, you have to do this.<p>4. Many of us do this not out of coercion, but because we want to. I personally have a set of goals, own a bunch of stuff that I really want to get done. 8 hours is not enough.<p>5. As you grow senior, you spend a ton of time co-ordinating work. This means unless you dedicate time before and after regular office hours, you personally aren&#x27;t going to get coding done. And somethings require your personal coding/debugging effort - no way around it.<p>Family setup is personal: At least in my case, thankfully my wife chose to be a home maker and a full time mom. This frees up a lot of my responsibilities and allows me to focus harder on my job for the betterment of the family as a unit. YMMV.<p>EDIT: I always plug my team, so will do it again here.

We recommended that the criminalization of drug use should be replaced by a public health approach.&quot; So the request here is not to say that everyone should use drugs however they wish without regulation, but rather that use of certain drugs should no longer be subject to criminal penalties. A few years ago, Richard Branson&#x27;s blog post on drug regulation[1] similarly pointed to reducing criminal penalties without saying that drugs should be entirely unregulated, by looking at the example of Portugal. (How is Portugal doing these days?)<p>The state I live in in the United States, Minnesota, has a low rate of incarceration in large part because it has a low rate of criminal prosecution of drug offenses, with even the small number of persons convicted of drug offenses being unlikely to do time in prison. But this state has a thriving private industry of drug treatment centers, drawing in people from all over the world who want to become clean, and responses to drug use often include judicially ordered drug treatment. Stopping a war on drugs waged by the police and courts and prisons doesn&#x27;t have to include giving up on discouraging drug use.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/time-to-end-the-war-on-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/time-to-end-the-war-on...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: I&#x27;ll use the last bit of my edit window to post two more links to news reports about the experience of Portugal.

This way session_1 take exclusive lock on the corresponding row, and session_2 execution is suspended until session_1 will commit.<p>2) Using more strict SERIALIZABLE isolation level. In this mode, session_1 in MySQL will take shared lock on each selected row, and each SELECT effectively becomes SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE. This way session_2 also blocks until session_1 will commit.<p>In PostgreSQL, SERIALIZED mode implemented the other way - SELECT works as usual (without locks), but during UPDATE session_1 will detect that the row was changed by concurrent transaction, and transaction of session_1 will be terminated with the exception &quot;could not serialize access due to concurrent update&quot;.",1383758984

And that did pay the bills because of a few other advantages I had growing up - I had a cheap tax-payer funded education, but it was truly remarkable one beyond the textbooks.<p>My CS grad education cost approx 500$ for 4 years, had good teachers.

The labs were good with mostly SunOS/Netware boxes & a few Xilinx boards donated by alumni. I even had to do 8086 assembly by hand in hex for my lab exams.<p>My classmates included children of cab drivers, college professors, household help and of the filthy rich - we weren&#x27;t equal outside college, but in class we were on the same level. Social class got scrubbed out of our egos and talent showed no correlation. And the EE course had 17 boys for approx 160 girls.<p>But that said all of us were the top ~1% of the state educational system after the math-heavy entrance tests (I had to get a double digit rank in approx 5-6 million people, to qualify).<p>Most of us spoke English as a first language (at least as good as one), nearly all of us bilingual (and not in the same languages) who were used to our English being misunderstood.

Meanwhile, the wheels of businesses funded by invading privacy or otherwise exploiting users via modern technologies tend to turn very fast.

It&#x27;s a premise that is not exactly divorced from reality. E.g. I would certainly be at least concerned if my daughter&#x27;s friends were drug users, because I do think children and adolescents can pick up bad habits from the people around them. To these people, the possibility of drugs raises the threat of personal danger to their families.<p>Some people further think that bad habits like drug use can be controlled through legal means. I don&#x27;t think they believe it can be eliminated, but I think they believe that if we did not have a drug war, drug use would be a lot more common.<p>Furthermore, those people can justify the damage caused by enforcement on the grounds that it happens to people who bring it upon themselves, by participating in drug use and drug trade. Even this proposition isn&#x27;t totally divorced from reality, at least within the U.S. There is lots of collateral damage, but by and large the people dying in gang wars are involved in gangs to begin with, and the people in jail for drug crimes did use or deal drugs.<p>You don&#x27;t have to agree with any of this to concede that these ideas are rooted in some sort of moral framework.

It makes an abstraction real to them by bringing their experience into play. It gives them a hook by which to remember an important point. This does <i>not</i> mean, &quot;tell a story every time you want to make a point&quot; because straining for effect while trying to persuade, even in trying to weave stories into your narrative, is self-defeating. The point is not to show how how clever or artful you are, it is to make your points in ways that will stick. To do that, you need above all to be sincere and credible. You need to use the power of logic where it applies. You need to bring in emotive elements when apt and when they fit naturally into your narrative. You need to use imagery that is original, not borrowed, drawing from your experience if possible and then from the use of a vigorous imagination. And you need to do all this with forceful use of language, with active style that moves quickly without pausing to try to impress.<p>When you do all that, and do it well, you will find your audience at each level <i>relating</i> to you and to what you are saying. Stories can add powerfully to that relational effect. Like a fellow out in nature watching birds from afar and suddenly seeing them up close and vividly through magnification, your hearer or reader will find himself drawn close to what might otherwise be a distant narrative through stories that enliven the very things he is eager to see. Your audience <i>wants</i> to relate. Help them along with this with stories where apt. If knowing the science behind this helps, apply that as well.

What does equal rights for beings with different numbers of tentacles mean to us?  Humans think its hilarious good time to fight and kill each other over multinational corporations &quot;owning&quot; teams of grown men playing childrens ball games, so if you think humans aren&#x27;t going to kill each other over &quot;equal rights for unequal tentacles&quot; from some alien culture, you&#x27;re a little over optimistic.<p>Looking at politics, many humans behave as quislings and support groups that basically exist to ruin the groups the quislings are members of.  What happens when the same type of quisling susceptible personality meets space aliens is so weird I can&#x27;t even think of a sci fi story about it.<p>Also assuming light speed communication is more realistic than light speed transportation, something along the lines of internet trolling behavior is unfortunately highly likely.

One obvious solution, of course, is to avoid limiting yourself to looking at a pair of existing flawed bills and find a politician willing to back real reform.<p>Another solution, better for HN, is to work toward technical solutions that will work in the likely event that our esteemed leaders in Washington, D.C. get it wrong once again.

The entire game simulation code and logic runs locally and is sent to the server, the server than collects all the inputs and calculates differences to the world state and sends back the diffs with predictions based on latency. These diffs may differ from the local state, and so corrections are applied.  In the majority of cases, the differences are minor enough that the player doesn&#x27;t notice.  When they are severe, the player notices hitbox inaccuracy or worse, rubberbanding as his actions are &quot;snapped back&quot;.<p>So when you&#x27;re playing an FPS and you press a button to shoot, the local game logic and physics computes and displays the result immediately (firing animation, sound start playing). A short delay later, the server confirms a kill.<p>Even with this fairly sophisticated model, you still want <50ms pings.

You can usually find one in any given Walmart, although they mainly seem to be targeting the gas stations currently.<p>I do wonder at what point the overhead of stocking the machines exceeds the income earned by having one conveniently located to pretty much anyone. Can they afford to keep them stocked with all the latest videos when they have one at every gas station and Walmart in a state?<p>On a related note we recently tried out the new redbox streaming app on the PS3. It was not a... smooth... experience. Errors galore, images failing to load, and actually getting the video you bought to play is pretty much a roll of the dice. I think their servers were woefully unprepared for the load they were subjected to.",1383767973

If I&#x27;m doing my job properly, and so are the other web developers, none of us is or should be <i>entitled</i> to top placement. Also, placement depends heavily on factors that are solely in <i>your</i> control as the site owner, such as the quality of the content.&quot;<p>But when web devs say this, clients sometimes think we&#x27;re just trying to shirk responsibility.

6685006,comment,6684156,6684156,10,0,rayiner,,,"This is generally good advice, but I&#x27;d like to discuss #6 (double billing during travel) and #9 (overbilling on assignments). Both are highly unethical practices. I can&#x27;t imagine that they&#x27;re all that common, if only because in this day and age of electronic billing and sophisticated clients, it&#x27;s so easy to get caught doing something like that.<p>As for #4 and #7, as a client you can probably get concessions given that it&#x27;s a buyer&#x27;s market for legal services right now.[1] But generally, I think those practices are legit. The cost of training is baked into the price of every product you buy, and legal services is no different. With regards to #7 specifically, that tends to be a situation where the junior lawyer who doesn&#x27;t say anything on the call will be the one doing whatever work comes out of the call. It will cost you more money in the long run if he or she isn&#x27;t on the call and has to get a download after the fact.<p>A better approach is to communicate via e-mail when possible and communicate directly with the associate doing your work unless the partner needs to be involved. This is kind of related to #2 and #10. Where I used to work, mid-level and senior associates would handle the day-to-day communications with the client for securities offerings or credit agreements worth tens of millions of dollars. If you retain a large firm where an associate will be doing most of the work on your matters, then find a team where the partner in charge is good at delegating the day-to-day stuff so you don&#x27;t have to incur his higher rates for that sort of thing. Alternatively, depending on your needs, you might find a small outfit or even a solo practitioner who will be doing most of the work on your matter himself or herself, and doesn&#x27;t need to deal with the inherent overhead of delegation.<p>[1] Given that, it might just be easier to skip the nitpicking and ask for a 10% discount on the final bill.<p>PS: What do people here thing about fixed fee arrangements? I&#x27;m not sure how they should be structured for a startup, but that would avoid a lot of the silliness inherent in billing. At the end of the day, there is a price to legal services based on supply and demand. Whether you charge for law students or raise the top line fee or give an across-the-board discount is ultimately cosmetic.",1383767497

6684991,comment,6680870,6683185,1,0,dustingetz,,,"&quot;From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are a key to profitability. ...&quot;<p>wrote Phil Greenspun[1], here&#x27;s the rest of the quote:<p>&quot;... Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per week keeping current with new technology, getting coordinated with other programmers, contributing to documentation and thought leadership pieces, and comprehending the structures of the systems being extended. Under this assumption, a programmer who works 55 hours per week will produce twice as much code as one who works 40 hours per week. In The Mythical Man-Month, the only great book ever written on software engineering, Fred Brooks concludes that no software product should be designed by more than two people. He argues that a program designed by more than two people might be more complete but it will never be easy to understand because it will not be as consistent as something designed by fewer people. This means that if you want to follow the best practices of the industry in terms of design and architecture, the only way to improve speed to market is to have the same people working longer hours. Finally there is the common sense notion that the smaller the team the less management overhead. A product is going to get out the door much faster if it is built by 4 people working 70-hour weeks (180 productive programmer-hours per week, after subtracting for 25 hours of coordination and structure comprehension time) than if by 12 people working 40-hour weeks (the same net of 180 hours per week). The 12-person team will inevitably require additional managers and all-day meetings to stay coordinated.&quot;[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-software-engineers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-softwar...</a> (halfway down the page on this)",1383767310

The aim should be helping that company to get to a stage that they can have a big exit, and charging for things like these is only going to constrain that possibility.

This is a tall order, of course, but even a decent attempt at it would probably be better than the utter contempt for privacy and blatant exploitation of users&#x27; ignorance that is widespread today.<p>As a benchmark, I suggest looking at the way organisations like Facebook have presented privacy settings. Non-technical people understand concepts like sharing data with everyone vs. limited audiences, or allowing their name/photo to be associated with something. Significant numbers of people do set these preferences, and do object when they are violated or when their &quot;preferences&quot; are changed for them.

We already have socialized medicine, its just the &quot;wrong&quot; middlemen are profiteering.<p>From personal experience via a friend with a broken arm, the hospital will eventually present you with the most amazing collection of bills you&#x27;ve ever seen with the most unimaginable rates, so a simple non-compound arm fracture and cast will end up billed as $50K.  The goal of the hospital is to book as large of a paper loss as possible, so the paper loss will probably exceed actual service cost by a couple orders of magnitude.  Somehow the ER doc who spent about 15 minutes verifying yes it is indeed broken will charge 6 hours of dedicated time, you&#x27;ll be billed for entire jars of painkillers if they give you a single pill, etc.  It&#x27;ll take about six months for all the bills to arrive from all the doctors and the hospital, but bill collectors will start calling before the first bill arrives.   Once you&#x27;re sure you have all the bills, its bankruptcy time, which costs some time and money.  So the real cost of any lifesaving medical procedure never exceeds maybe $2K to a lawyer, maybe less.  She needed the car insurance money from the accident to get the car to continue to attend school and work, don&#x27;t recall how she paid for the bankrupcty.  Bankruptcy is actually pretty expensive and not surprisingly the sharks in the biz only take cash.  The bankruptcy doesn&#x27;t really matter, because part time no benefits minimum wage retail cashiers are not going to get mortgages and new car loans anyway.  Legally officially it could be an issue for 7 years or whatever, in practice its not an issue after a couple years at most.  I suppose if you had the misfortune to break your arm the week before graduation and you get a real job, you&#x27;d be out a substantial amount of money.  It would be highly unwise to get married if you&#x27;re poor, because if she was my wife at the time, I&#x27;d have had my financial life destroyed by her mere car accident and broken arm.

I like the conflicting POV aspect because it can encourage the reader to question the author&#x27;s reliability, like in Edgar Allen Poe&#x27;s <i>The Tell-Tale Heart</i>. Unfortunately, Post Modernism can also have the opposite effect: encouraging readers to quit thinking too hard and to accept the text as it is since &quot;it&#x27;s all equally valid&quot;. This negative aspect fits really well with the self-esteem movement, which (I&#x27;ll say again) I think is a cop out for thinking critically.<p>You may notice I&#x27;m not refuting Solipsism per se, but ulterior motives for believing Solipsism is valid. This is because going down the road of &quot;formal proofs&quot; probably won&#x27;t yield anything convincing. We&#x27;d simply talk past each other, and in circles, and bicker over definitions. But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to disprove abstractions and ideologies sin finding an inherent contradiction. And I&#x27;ll even admit, maybe Solipsism actually is true. Who knows? I won&#x27;t claim outright that Solipsism is false. But in my own experience, I find it <i>very unlikely</i> that Solipsism is true * . And I do want to acknowledge a possible bias for believing &quot;Solipsism is true&quot; due to it&#x27;s convenience.<p>* <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes</a><p>p.s.

I live in Brazil and I don&#x27;t think decriminalization would reduce violence around here, it would, at its best, move the focus away from the drug addict to other parts of the society.<p>Collaborators from large drug organizations (tens of thousands of criminals, running millionaire operations, heavily armed) won&#x27;t simply boo-hoo, go home and look for real jobs once drugs are decriminalized. They would look for the new weaker link of the chain and then concentrate all their violence on it. Once drugs are legalized and are freely sold on public points of sale (whatever government calls them), criminals would target the &quot;supply chain&quot; and distribution network. All of the sudden drug organizations would find themselves operating wholesale, not retail anymore. They would steal cargo to sell it at poor city areas or in places where official suppliers haven&#x27;t established POSes yet. Stealing (buying for zero) and selling is much more attractive than &quot;cooking&quot; and selling. It&#x27;s like outsourcing your production the bad way, keeping the benefit of higher profit margins. Higher margins lead to more competition, thus guns, thus violence among organizations (this is the current scenario in cities like Rio where drug organizations fight for territory dominance[1]). On the bright side, anyone interested in consuming drugs would be spared of this fight. They would be the same people who ever bought drugs, but now with the benefit of new regulations, treatment and care from the government.<p>[1] This video shows a battle between two drug organizations in Rio that mobilized around 100 members coming from different slums. You can see a great deal of collateral damage in the local population, and this is what my point is all about.

I think what is different in how I conceive of a product in this post is that in many ways the product (whether a novel, piece of literature, film, painting, etc.) is never finished. It is always a work in progress, a coming-to-be. I did my graduate work in philosophy and multimedia creative works at the European Graduate School, which took a smattering of filmmakers, philosophers, artists, etc. to come together and produce. I found an interesting commonality in the creative process amongst all of them. That commonality was that inevitably the creative work was produced for someone - the customer, viewer, listener, audience. And in that way creative works are a dialogue with an-other. This is what lean is all about at heart. It is making whatever you are working on a dialogue with someone else and incorporating that feedback into the build-measure learn loop.<p>I, however, do not think that the two are mutually exclusive and even if you are only concerned with the work as an artistic creation, the relationship between the author and the audience is still important.",1383765082

Why do you think people keep working on various fields like physics when most of them are theories that might be disproved very soon?<p>You are also forgetting the reason where you want to address the engineering need in you: Some of us have fun making this. Believe it or not, We want to do this :)<p>I do have other time that I spend with my family etc. More or less is personal preference. Family is one of those things that one can sink in infinite time and still feel incomplete - we all strike balances. FWIW - I sleep only 6 hours or so, so it provides a bit of a leg up. I usually nap a bit on the weekends though.<p>My meta-point is: Some people look at a job as a means to make a living. I look at mine as an opportunity. Here I have a company that is willing to put millions of dollars in the direction I point at or into the work that I am doing, based purely on trust. This kind of scale / experience is impossible to get by myself. For this I have to go the extra mile. The end result might benefit the company, but I find joy in the process of creation.<p>The company is not exactly chintzy either. They compensate me well enough to keep that from becoming an issue to me or my family.",1383764719

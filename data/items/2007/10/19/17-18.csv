Description logics (e.g. OWL) have been a solution in search of a problem since the 1980's. Really 99% of the effort on the semantic web goes into 'building' vapor-ware. I call BS on these folks and the only way they are going to prove me wrong is by actually doing something that solves a real problem.<p>In academia the 'group think' among the semantic web folks has been astounding. Try asking them to represent customer-supplier-product type relationships and you will get a vapid or angry stare. Ask them to do anything with time or measure and they start babbling about yet another upcoming and crytic standard. Anything beyond binary relationships gives them major headaches. It takes a database/logic weenie like myself to point this out to them... And I am never satisfied with their answers.\n",1192816522

The web / startup scene is not impressive. The VC's are really conservative, and don't seem to get the early funding scheme. They'd much rather give millions at a later stage.

70409,comment,69763,69834,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Maybe that is one thing that makes CS more difficult than other areas... that you <i>must</i> learn by doing. We really are hard-wired to learn by imitation (as the original commenter said). That is how we learn language, social norms, etc. CS, however, is definitely something that you need to learn by doing.<p>Interestingly, that may also explain the idea of ""computer geeks"". If CS selects for people who learn by doing instead of by imitation, you are more likely to see those types of individuals. If social norms and social interaction is learned by imitation, those are abilities that are harder to learn for someone who is more inclined to learn in another way.",1192815772

I really thought about shooting an upset sounding email to Paul. But thought the better of it -- amazing that every other person on that list did the same. Only when I met the YCombinators on the interviews to a subsequent cycle did I figure that they were nice people (inspite of not making it). Absolutely no hard feelings, though. Looking back, I simply was not prepared enough to do a startup. I eventually got around to realizing that I did not need money to built a product -- just a committed co-founder -- and so thats what I did. Yesterday's rejection did not sting at all.",1192815502

Assume that you've got a company that does $100M in revenue, 30% of which comes from Europe (so $70M from US, $30M from Europe).  They spend $90M to get that revenue, all in USD, for margins of 10% and earnings of $10M.<p>Now say that the Euro appreciates 20% against the dollar.  That $30M in Euros becomes worth $36M.  Total revenue goes up to $106M, but expenses stay constant at $90M.  Profit is up to $16M, a 60% increase.  However, the operation of the business hasn't changed at all - it's <i>all</i> due to currency fluctuations.",1192814820

Facebook could provide it but Apple hate them.  Apple could roll out a new version of iTunes in a couple of days, replacing the Ping sidebar with Twitter.  Deeper integration into iTunes would follow. <i>More than a couple of days needed, but still holds true</i><p>Various free messaging apps are doing quite well on the iPhone.  Bringing Twitter in as a native app on iOS devices would both expand Twitter, and provide another differentiator for Apple products.  Other platforms would continue to be supported, but Twitter could be plumbed into iOS at the OS level.  Networks would bitch about their SMS revenue dropping, but Apple doesnt give a shit about that. <i>Apple launched iMessage and wiped out the network operators SMS revenue</i><p>Twitter and Apple share a love of simplicity, both of concept and of design.  Their users are from similar demographics.  Twitter is heavily used by celebrities and musicians, their feeds could be linked in to their products on iTunes.  Buying an album could offer you the chance to follow the artist on Twitter.  If Jony Ive was designing a social network, it would look like Twitter. <i>This is definitely true and remains so.  The only thing that Apple wouldn't like is ugly usernames like Sasha85_x</i><p>Simple really.  Apple could provide the missing revenue that Twitter needs.  It might not make Twitter profitable, but it could bring it up to a level of lossmaking that was justifiable for the top-tier messaging service among handset manufacturers.<p>Twitters most recent valuation was reportedly $8billion.  Apple could probably buy them for $12billion (a $4bn profit over a matter of months).  Thats not much out of Apples $76billion stockpile. <i>That stockpile is now $110bn</i><p>6. Twitter people would be happy to go to Apple.  Theyre cool, Apple is cool  it works. <i>They </i>think* they're cool*<p>7. I can actually visualize Steve Jobs walking onto stage and announcing it.  Talk of changing the world etc. etc. etc. <i>Sad.</i><p>You shouldnt follow me on Twitter because I dont use it.  In fact it really pisses me off, but I can see that it works for millions of people. <i>I use it a bit more now, but it still riles me up.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alexmuir.com/2011/08/why-apple-will-buy-twitter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexmuir.com/2011/08/why-apple-will-buy-twitter/</a>",1343468715

4305163,comment,4301739,4302951,2,0,RobAley,,,"I actually think that PHPs syntax is good (in the main), it seems to fit with the way my thought process works and I'm incredibly efficient with it. It's different from many other languages syntax, it's verbose in places and not as ""intellectually pleasing"" as some, but for getting work done (at least for developers like me) its hard to beat. It's not that I haven't been exposed to other languages, I did a degree in computer science and have worked for 12 years in the industry (formally commercial, latterly academic) using assorted different languages. But since I discovered it, to this day I still prefer PHP, in large part due to the syntax.<p>And I think it is largely untrue to say that there is a lack of attention to other aspects of the language, particularly recently. The focus on performance increases, changes to the internals to implement new features (albeit often via a syntax-first approach!) and the current discussions around the future of PHP (PHP6 and Zend Engine 3) which aren't by any measure solely about syntax show that there is a wider appreciation of different aspects of the language.<p>PHP has a different focus from many languages, and that is why some people leave (or don't start in the first place) and find a language that is better suited for them. But for a large number of us it is a useful hammer that hits our particular nails right on the head, and that's not a bad thing.",1343468561

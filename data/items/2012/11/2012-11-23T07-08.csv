4821306,comment,4819832,4819832,1,0,Osiris,,,"The problem here is the way the school is funded.  The reason that the school put forward is that the school's funding is based on the number of kids marked as in attendance in first period so they are using this system to increase those numbers by locating students already on campus but not in class.<p>So root cause here is the funding model. That's what needs to be changed. Funding should not be based on a variable number of students that happen to be at school on a given day.  There are a number of fixed costs in running a school that the current funding model doesn't take into account.<p>So if you're pissed at this you should be more pissed at WHY they implemented it in the first place.",1353657503

A great documentary, highly recommended.<p>But Pixar wasn't all roses either - during the tight production of Toy Story 2 (because they changed almost all of the story and had to rush it for christmas), a couple (who were both animators) forgot that their 1-year old was in the car (and <i>not</i> in the day care!), and the girl was there for almost 10 hours... She lived, but still a pretty horrible story.<p>The source for this unpleasant anecdote is [2]. It's a long talk by Ed Catmull, but I can't recommend it enough. It's <i>really, really awesome</i>.<p><pre><code>    Success hides problems (Ed Catmull)

Want to know why Pixar was awesome for soooo long? It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because they had great animators. It wasn't even (entirely) because they told terrific stories. It was because they constantly learned from their ""successes""... Watch (or listen) to Catmull's talk.

From you example it looks to me like the problem is that Scala requires type declarations and supports default arguments.  I don't understand how this is worse than the equivalent Java example.  I also don't understand how the Ruby version is inherently better.  The only difference seems to be static vs. dynamic typing.<p>2. I don't understand how Play 2 screwed over Scala developers.  It seems like Play 2 is much better for Scala developers.  Scala is now a first class supported language instead of just an add on module.  I also don't understand how Play 1 was 'the' thing that was bringing web developers to Scala.  It wasn't in any way a core part of the framework.  It was just something you could optionally use.  Scala is something you could optionally use in any Java web framework.",1353655383

For instance, Gmail's ""Loading..."" messages will also notify you when you have lost or gained a connection.<p>Surely consistent messaging and notifications is better for the user. Chrome has a desktop notifications API, but that's only appropriate for certain types of messages, such as receiving a new email. In general, it's probably best to handle messaging at the application level.",1353655368

To live without action is not living, but I guess you are ""not dead"". However, to fully embrace being ""not dead"" means you still need to do something.<p>Why in the hell philosophy is being so heavily considered here is beyond me though. If hackers really think about life too much, they stop hacking and start living. Hacking is doing but in a way that really isn't changing anything truly permanently. Having kids and providing them with a good environment that they then pass on to their kids and their kids... that is permanent. They won't remember your crappy webapp or your nifty tech startup nor will they give a shit about your talk circuit or the books you wrote on some aspect of some framework that no one will use 10 years from now.<p>Helping others and raising a family can do real and permanent good.

Which is to say a comet that missed by 50,000 to 125,000' rather than further out. The speculation is that it would result in wide spread fires (the compressive heating of the air in front of it would ignite things). Basically it could transfer a lot of energy to the atmosphere. But most felt that a comet that close would be in pieces and at least some of it would leave a crater trail.",1353654995

4821218,comment,4820898,4820898,22,0,bad_user,,,"I don't think this is a good guide for Learning Scala.<p>The Introduction from scala-lang.org and a Tour of Scala are not good introductions. They are meant as a TL;DR that will leave you scratching your head and reading the list of features without the larger context of a language is an awful way to learn about that language.<p>IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin is a good IDE, but the article should have included a link to the Scala-IDE plugin for Eclipse. It's not friendly for beginners to make them install a plugin, which is why Typesafe is already providing a download of a completely configured 
Eclipse here: <a href=""http://typesafe.com/stack/scala_ide_download"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typesafe.com/stack/scala_ide_download</a><p>Also, when starting out with a language I would rather use a plain text editor and the compiler directly, because complicated tools bring with them complicated problems ... Hello World with just the compiler is just one text file that you can directly execute, versus the notion of whatever a project is in an IDE. And you should start with the REPL anyway.<p>""<i>Scala for Java Refugees</i>"" is an article series that's out of date and not that good frankly. There already is a comment here from somebody saying he was scared when he saw in that series the usage of implicit conversions - a feature that in Scala 2.10 is considered experimental, for really advanced use-cases and that has to be enabled manually, as for most purposes there are better solutions available - but on the other hand, the context of a feature matters a lot. Implicit conversions are great for dealing with the ""<i>expression problem</i>"" and through their means, Arrays (a fundamental JVM data-structure with a broken interface) behave like plain Seqs in Scala, while Strings are considered to be lists of chars (as in Haskell or Lisp).<p>I didn't like Alex Payne's ""<i>Programming Scala</i>"" book. It's boring, it's poorly organized and it's out of date - for instance a big part of it involves dealing with Scala's Actors, but Scala's Actors were terrible, which is why in Scala 2.10 the implementation in the standard library gets replaced with Akka, which is the defacto standard anyways, but it also has a slightly different API and concepts. Actors are also the kind of powerful construct that's not easy to tame, being an awful way to start learning Scala ... before Akka Actors, look into Scala's Parallel collections, or into Akka's Futures and Promises or into ScalaSTM.<p>Speaking of Parallel Collections and Futures and Promises, no mention of Scala's Documentation project?<p><a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/</a><p>A much better introduction to the language is ""<i>Scala for the Impatient</i>"", a book that wasn't mentioned and one third of the book (enough to get you started) is available from Typesafe's website: <a href=""http://blog.typesafe.com/free-pdf-from-typesafe-scala-for-the-impatien-64715"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.typesafe.com/free-pdf-from-typesafe-scala-for-th...</a><p>You also cannot write about learning resource, without mentioning ""<i>Programming in Scala</i>"" by Odersky, a wonderful book also meant for human beings. Its only problem is that it's a tome of information and you may not have the patience for that, but it's not a hard to digest book so if you've got the time and patience, then this is THE book you should read: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed</a><p>And you must also mention ""<i>Scala in Depth</i>"" by Joshua Suereth, which is like the equivalent of ""Effective Java"", a ~ 300-pages book you definitely must read once you're done with ""Scala for the Impatient"": <a href=""http://www.manning.com/suereth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manning.com/suereth/</a><p>On the other hand the Coursera Course taught by Odersky on Function Programming is awesome.

The films, the movements in them, are not used to be so polished in the time domain. With the new time resolution you see all the motion more precise, and it just sucks, it is not as good as you used to think of it when it was in 24 FPS. Despite the stupid myth, the 24 FPS is way below what you need to feel the picture as realistic. Now the moving picture starts looking realistic, but what you realistically see is actors, decorations, and CG, the old approaches are not convincing anymore. The film makers just need to adapt to the high-definition time domain, to make films look cool again with the new level of precision.",1357797543

5035710,comment,5032843,5035212,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"We could start by not making censorship the default: If a notice is received, notify the poster of the video that it will be removed in e.g. 24 hours if they don't submit a counter notice. Then it comes down after the grace period if they don't identify themselves and file a counter notice consenting to the jurisdiction of at least one U.S. federal district court, but if they do then the content stays up until a court says otherwise. And given that filing a counter notice is a de facto invitation to be sued, infringers who submit them improperly will have to answer for it in court, which should reduce the number of people willing to do so. On the other hand, in cases like the one in question here, the facts will have to go through the copyright holder's actual lawyers and a federal judge before any censorship occurs, which should do a good job stamping out fraudulent take downs as well.<p>In reality this is how the legal system works for almost everything else: First you ask nicely, and if the parties can't agree then you go to court. But in most cases the party in the wrong (at least in theory) knows that they'll lose in court and so concedes immediately and everything works as it ought to without taxing the court system.",1357797369

5035708,comment,5034330,5035198,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is probably a contentious topic, but housing security is a useful thing. Owning a residence, and perhaps more saliently owning it without debt, provides a certain level of housing security that is quite precious when you are older. The other benefit of owning property is that you can use it to generate income when you're not using it. While being a landlord is a pain, if you're willing to give up some of the return you can negotiate that out to a third party and that provides a bit of income security.<p>Sometimes having one less thing to worry about can be the difference between taking a risk that changes your life in a positive way and not taking it.<p>The bottom line for me is that I've never heard anyone say ""I wish I had more things to worry about.""",1357797343

For instance, the US went to war partially because its citizens were being impressed into a foreign navy for essentially no pay. Young people were forced to become soldiers via the draft. Entire racial groups were forced to do manual labor that was ""beneath"" freemen. My guess is that, unless healthcare workers are able to demand higher wages in some way, that we'll ""find"" a cheap labor supply, be they foreign workers or ""recruited"" young workers. Or, for much the same reasons that teachers are underpaid compared to their skills and education level, society as a whole will refuse to raise healthcare wages once those jobs become a cornerstone of our society.",1357797266
5035703,comment,5034544,5035246,1,0,tomku,,,"There are two separate issues here, adultery as a crime and adultery as a breach of contract.  I'll talk about US laws, since they're the ones I'm most familiar with.<p>Adultery as a crime is still surprisingly common, but going away fast.  Prosecutions for it in Western countries are extremely rare, and the laws making it illegal in 23 US states are just waiting to be challenged and overthrown.  Most people seem to think that it's not the government's business to decide that all husbands and wives must remain faithful or be fined/jailed.<p>Adultery as a breach of contract is a little trickier, because a marriage contract is a special kind of contract that covers things that normal contracts can't.  You can't sue someone for breaching their marriage vows, but you can divorce them.  In the past, you needed grounds (such as adultery) to do so, but no-fault divorces are available now in every US state and several other Western countries.  Whether adultery is factored into decisions about alimony depends on the jurisdiction - some do, some don't.  It's a tricky issue, and relationships (particularly rocky ones) tend to be more complex than rigid rules can allow for.<p>On a more general point, I think that you'd have a hard time convincing a judge that lifetime sexual exclusivity is something you can sign away in any normal legal contract.  Marriage gets special treatment to allow for things like that, but the trade-off is that we expect married couples to try to deal with their own issues rather than getting the courts involved immediately.",1357797250

5035689,comment,5034330,5035206,4,0,kamaal,,,"You are onto something here.<p>Let me explain you what the problem is. The concept of work is relatively modern compared to the entire human history. Organized work is something that was needed to scale organized living, and growth of human population. Without agriculture, architecture, transport, communication and health care human kind wouldn't have made it till now. Hunter gatherers had it a little easy, each man for his own or at the max his offspring. But this was not scalable, then extremely unpredictable. To scale we had to get down to staying at one place for long periods of time[read: civilization], and then produce food in bulk quantities[Read: Agriculture/farming]. But no man would work for others, so then came in the concept of doing other kind of work. Like building homes, pottery, carts etc and then people would trade one for the other.<p>This was still OK, until the kingdoms and kings came along. And then automatically came the concept of slavery, then soldiers who are supposed to die for king. Misery was the norm in this era. A lot of people were stuck building large monuments and cities for kings. Its during this period the notion 'born into richness' and 'born into poverty' evolved and to a very large extent continues till today.<p>If you are born to some one poor, the world assumes you now have absolutely no 'right' to be rich. And if you do get rich by your work, the rick kids/people think of it as unfair to them. And now matter how lazy, unproductive some rich guy is he considers it unfair to him that he must become poor out of his own actions.",1357797073

It was terrifying to start with, walking up to complete strangers and asking to take a picture of them, and it took me 1-2h each day before finding the picture. By the time I wrapped up the project I took that down to 30 min, and didn't even break a sweat. My rejection rate also went way, way down, and I was able to get much better pictures than the ""man, this is awwwwwkward"" images from the beginning of the project.<p>The one thing to note though, is that (at least for me) the effects of this kind of ""therapy"" aren't permanent.

5035629,comment,5029720,5035096,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Why do you expect that capital held offshore for tax reasons is invested inefficiently? These companies are not (in general) in violation of the law, they're just exploiting transfer pricing[1] to accumulate capital in a foreign subsidiary in a low tax jurisdiction. That subsidiary can for the most part still invest it in whatever, including U.S. stocks and other securities. They can in many cases even loan it back to their domestic sister company so that it can use the money to grow its business (without paying tax on it, because it's a loan instead of income), which often provides even more tax benefits because the interest paid on the loan is often tax deductible in the higher tax jurisdiction.<p>There are some restrictions, e.g. the U.S. company may not be able to issue a dividend or do a stock buyback unless it reports at least some taxable profits within the U.S., but as long as the foreign subsidiary's capital account keeps growing, it causes the parent company's stock price to appreciate accordingly and that provides investors with their ROI.<p>There are ways that this can be less efficient. In particular, the parent company's investors may themselves have made more efficient investment choices than the company's executives investing the money on their behalf if their returns were provided in the form of dividends or stock buyback instead of stock price appreciation as the existing tax code strongly encourages. And this is actually very likely to be the case in practice, because e.g. Apple executives are now sitting on a huge mountain of cash that it likely will never be more cost effective to issue all of as dividends under the current tax code than continue to invest in situ, which means that computer company executives are now permanently in charge of picking stocks for however many hundred billion dollars worth of the world economy. That doesn't guarantee that those execs will make worse investment decisions (or will choose poorly in hiring someone to do it), but it seems at least plausible that someone hired primarily for their ability to sell iPhones or manage a global supply chain will be a worse hedge fund manager than an actual hedge fund manager. But this is just the capital gains tax debate all over again: As long as we tax even reinvested dividends immediately but allow unrealized stock appreciation to be tax deferred indefinitely we're going to spur that sort of crazy economic machinations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_pricing</a>",1357795756

If a movie has a big enough pull for you to go drive to a theatre to watch it, the company that owns the movie realises you're willing to pay a direct rental fee for the movie off itunes or something.  I'm going to wing it and say the studio might make 2-3 dollars on a single movie digital rental, but maybe 20-30 cents of your 8 dollars a month if they stuck it into a streaming service.<p>Do you really expect to get a pile of movies and TV you'd willingly pay, idk, 30-40$ a month for if bought individually in an 8$ streaming package?  Netflix doesn't have big films because the people who own big films know that on the bottom line, their product has enough draw to be  worth more when sold alone.  And I mean, sure, a subscription model has more reliable cashflow sometimes, and maybe they can trade product worth for popularity and bulk sales and make more money, but who knows what might happen?  Combined with the fact some of these studios have enough content to make their own web distribution services and remain in control of their web presence, and the worry that putting too much content on the web might kill the money they make from TV, it's just an iffy decision to shake up everything and put stuff on the streaming web until somebody comes around and makes a netflix people are willing to pay 20$ a month for - maybe even the 40-50$ you'd pay for a nice cable package, and can offer them some real royalties.",1357795751

We got punks who don't believe one person can do a compiler.  Lots of old timers have done compilers.  Just remember the C64 ROM was 20K.  That's maybe 20,000 lines of code.

Common Lisp was designed from 1981 on. The Lisp community (here the successors of Maclisp) went to explore a lot of new ground: implementations on mini computers, mainframes, super computers, parallel machines, microprocessors, stack architectures, on top of other programming languages like C, etc. There were small and stupid compilers, optimizing compilers, whole-program compilers, ...  It was a time of experimentation. At that time a lot of behavior was not defined to allow compiler writes to explorer different types of implementations. With the knowledge of a decade later some of that could have been defined more precisely, but then the standardization process ran out of steam due to lack of funding and interest.<p>Using SETQ on an undefined variable may be undefined in the Common Lisp standard, but every implementation deals with that and allows it. That's a non-issue. There are a lot of other things which isn't defined in the standard and which all implementations deal with. Garbage Collection. Also not in the standard, but every user expects garbge to be collected.<p>It would be nice to have less undefined behavior, but it has nothing to do with good or bad. It was useful in a time of experimenting.<p>Even worse for Common Lisp was that in 1981 there wasn't yet an OOP system for Lisp that was explored and accepted.

I remember my association to information more than the information itself. It's why I'm bad at learning history (despite finding it fascinating) unless it's an issue that I can link to myself and relate to personally and build a connection. Similarly, on a weekly basis I Google for `site:news.ycombinator.com drivebyacct2 <some keyword I know I used>` to get back to a post or discussion that I want to reference.<p>I feel kind of bad about this as I introspect, I'm sure this reliance on third parties has a detrimental effect on my ability to remember information that I could compose to build new knowledge or apply to new situations.",1357794145

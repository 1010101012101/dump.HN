Why is this bad? (referring to frankenarrays of PHP)<p>The summary of my answer was:
1. you can't easily tell the algorithmic complexity of most algorithms in PHP involving these ""arrays""
2. naming something an array, that doesn't have the associated algorithmic complexity of an array, is misleading  and hurts education, research and knowledge sharing.<p>I explained both these answers, with two examples:
1. Whats the order of complexity of adding an element in the middle of ""an array"" in PHP? (i'll answer: its undefined)
2. What would you think if PHP named a function a a variable, and a variable a function?<p>So, I did in detail answer you question.<p>> you threw in a slew of insults and opinions about PHP and PHP programmers.<p>It wasn't meant to be insulting.

b) ??
c) difficult, yes<p>>As to your assertion that PHP is only good for simple projects employing low-skilled developers, tell that to the various PHP startups paying top dollar for skilled PHP developers.<p>No, my assertion was that PHP is only a good economic choice, when you choose to hire low-skilled, cheap employees. That's its niche.<p>>Twitter and Facebook have problems you and I are unlikely to have.<p>Agree. But that does not make what Facebook did with PHP, anything less than working around the issues caused by the initial commitment to PHP.<p>>JavaScript is another language that has a crazy-ish type system, but it doesn't get the hate that PHP does.<p>But it did. Even now, claiming that Javascript's language design isn't optimal isn't somethign people will argue against. Say the same thing about PHP, and you get threads like these...<p>>I have never had a case where PHP's arrays caused performance problems, but that's probably because I've also never written an application that didn't interact with some kind of back-end store like a database that was inevitable slower.<p>Now, the type of problems I'm pointing at, are the ones that read their head when the datasize gets larger. For example, an algorithm interacting with an array in PHP. Every loop it inserts or removes an element. Now depending on where that data can be found in the array, and if it's key is a number or a string, if these number-keys are close together in range or not, the algorithmic complexity is anything from  O(n) to (2^n).<p>In other words, the normal fauna of sorting algorithms are very hard, if not impossible to correctly implement in PHP.<p>This is not very relevant, if you just need a good sorting function for your array, since that is build-in. This is not relevant if you datasizes are always small.<p>So, this is not relevant in the small-scale world. But if there is a chance that will need to be implementing a complicated algorithm in PHP, that perhaps needs to interact with large datastructures, than PHP is a dangerous choice.<p>Beyond the limited scope of a database powered template with a bit of logic, it is simply not suited. It is not designed well enough to be 'general purpose' programming language, and its civic duty of all to warn those who think it is. (like the authors of this Node.php project)",1337474386

3997544,comment,3995970,3997249,4,0,SiVal,,,"The problem with the Chomsky nonsense about how the syntax of a language can't be learned from input (so much, so fast, with such bad data!), so it must be innate, is that they are not proving that the input is insufficient. They're just claiming it. They just say that they don't see how we could learn so much from so little, so it can't be done, so it isn't learned, it's inborn.<p>That's just the creationist argument: I can't see any way that something as complex as a human could emerge randomly, so it must have been assembled deliberately by a super-human creator. There's no other way.<p>Well, no. The thing you're missing here is that there might be algorithms that can do more than you realize.<p>If the Chomskians proved that the information to be learned simply <i>didn't exist</i> in the input--not that they didn't see it, but using information theoretic methods proved that it could not be there, then the learning algorithm wouldn't matter. It would not be possible for any algorithm.<p>But unless linguists prove the needed info isn't there (which is probably not possible using our limited knowledge of information theory), the ockham's razor hypothesis for how kids end up speaking the exact dialect they're surrounded with is that they possess algorithms capable of extracting the information from their surroundings.<p>Declaring such learning impossible because it doesn't look possible is like declaring human evolution impossible for the same reason. We're just beginning to discover that there are spectacularly powerful algorithms capable of doing things we never imagined.",1337474173

This is also not a compelling reason to choose a platform, and no intelligent person has ever chosen a platform based on how fast it compiles.<p>Easy Testing - HTML5 is no easier to test than anything else. Perhaps having to connect a device to test would be an exception. Simply not true.<p>It's not a plugin - This is irrelevant. If we're talking about browsers, flash has more penetration than HTML5 does right now. So which is worse -- a plugin that 99% of PC users already have, or an executable installer that needs to be run in order to update or change to a browser that supports canvas?<p>You can rapidly prototype with many languages.

The decision of whether to evaluate the default expression can be part of that.<p>The code that evaluates the default expression doesn't need to be in a separate function, either, so the argument that calling that function is too expensive also doesn't hold water.<p>I just tried a test in SBCL:<p><pre><code>  (defun foo1 (x) x)

>I mostly agree with your post but you've gone way over the top on this statement.<p>You are right, i went over board.<p>>Frameworks written in PHP are no more likely to have security issues or unpredictable performance bottlenecks than any other language<p>I suspect there is a measurable relationship between average quality of ecosystem and how easily or difficult a language is to use. But that would not be a fair argument: a language being easy  should be a good thing.<p>>Certainly nothing prevents you from writing well defined algorithms.<p>Well, not being able to guess the order of complexity of many of the core operations on datastructures, does make it a lot harder. It's generally undefined, at least by the language spec. And when the internal implementations of core datastructures change between versions, you can't even reliably implement the typical collection of sorting algorithms.<p>The reasons this isn't a problem at the smale scale, is that the most common operations are actually all build-in with good defaults.<p>>But ultimately there isn't much harm in it; it's just an extreme example of typelessness.<p>PHP is not typeless, just messy with types. Depending on the type, you can use different syntactical operators and you are unable to implement those same contructs for other types. Also dependent on the type, is the difference between value- and object- semantics. However, this logic is not consist with the actual algorithmic complexity. Strings are copy-on-write, for example. So you are technically passing a reference (from a performance POV), but acting like it's not.<p>PHP is a dynamically typed language, with lots of run-time type errors, when things don't match. We even have all kinds of functions to determine types. It's definately not typeless.",1337473153

It requires continuous attention and care, cleaning and feeding. Except, unlike in the case of twins, it can't be given a bath and fed alongside another baby. This baby is an attention-hungry baby with special needs and demands, which requires focused, dedicated care to thrive and grow.<p>And to reverse the analogy, caring for children is in itself a full-time job, just as hard if not harder than starting a company.

I am where I am right now because I blagged my way into circles, positions, and jobs I had no proper right to beI had no experience, little knowledge, and lacked respect for my elders (figuratively and literally speaking).

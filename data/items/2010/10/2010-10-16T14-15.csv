What you'll realize is that being comfortable has less to do with being able to sit at a blank terminal and typing than knowing how to traverse the documentation for each project.<p>People WANT to help you learn.  As long as you make some effort to try yourself, hang out in the python, django, jquery rooms and ask questions whenever you need.  I still do all the time.  Spend 5 earnest minutes each question looking for the answer.  If you keep asking questions that are answered by the first google hit, nobody will want to help.  But if you're making an effort to self-learn, people will be very sympathetic.<p>Typing ""terminal"" above also just reminded be that learning to use linux and vim was an entirely separate battle.  The process is the same.  You'll keep hitting tasks you don't know how to accomplish.  Google it and ask someone.  I still suck with both, and I'm still learning.<p>Its a tough battle, I definitely recommend you reach out to people in your city, find startups and say ""hey I suck, want a free intern?"" (I did this).  Try to sit in the same room as them once a week and hack.  Having an immediate resources available to answer questions verbally is huge.<p>You don't have to ""know"" how to do all that stuff to be able to write apps quickly, you need to know where to find all the information.<p>I'm probably slow by most people's standards here, but less than a year after I started I felt comfortable with deploying a small weekend project.  For the first 3 months, I was hacking 60+ hours a week, not because I felt like I should, but because once you start learning, you realize how much you still need to learn and you get obsessed.  There's a sick satisfaction to banging on your terminal and watching your vision come to life, little by little.  Every month you'll look back at your code and want to vomit.  This is a good sign (I think?).  Don't worry about memorizing anything, just worry about doing it more and more.  The things that you look up a lot will stick and your production efficiency will improve.<p>Last week I spent 60 hours to produce a crappy MVP of a project I""m working on, roughly 2300 lines of code.

In every other way, the middle class of today live like the <i>kings</i> of a hundred years ago.<p>We have abundant access to as much food as we want, whenever we want it, from nearly anywhere in the world. We have instant access to almost any kind of entertainment we can dream, most of it free or almost free of charge— and even for live entertainment, we can pick and choose from a fabulous array, and it costs almost nothing to participate.<p>We roll around in <i>self-powered, ultra-secure bubbles</i> that separate us almost entirely from the outside world, personal transportation that can take us across Europe or the continent of North America in a couple of days, and in another ten years those conveyances will be <i>self-operated</i> as well.<p>We have the capability to instantly communicate with nearly anyone most anywhere in the world as if they were standing right there in the room, and access to sometimes literally up to the <i>minute</i> information about the latest developments in science, technology, and politics. Not only that, we can afford to personally benefit from most of those developments.<p>And for those of us who live in what were once named the ""temperate"" regions, we even have the nerve to be <i>outraged</i> when we have to put up with the somewhat too-warm or too-cool nature of the natural environment, so used we are to having it exactly set to our tiny band of maximum comfort.<p>Of course, because there are <i>so many</i> people living like kings today, you wind up having to share most of those things with millions of other people, and it's easy to forget that you are <i>living like a king</i>. But regardless of that, giving it up because you're rich enough to pay someone to wipe your ass for you is pretty clearly the <i>wrong</i> answer in a couple of ways.",1287239116

I recommend a book called Learning Web Design: <a href=""http://www.learningwebdesign.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learningwebdesign.com/</a><p>It teaches like a math book, with practice problems after each lesson.<p>2. Pick a language to learn. I had a C++ background that I hadn't touched since high school, so I found Ruby a little confusing. But it may also be because of the teaching style of the books I used...<p>Anyway, I switched to PHP and learned from Larry Ullman's book, PHP 6 and MySQL 5 (<a href=""http://www.dmcinsights.com/phpmysql3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmcinsights.com/phpmysql3/</a>)<p>3. Going through both of these will probably take you 2-3 months if you're diligent. But once you're halfway through the second book, I'd say you know enough to start building something and using the PHP book as a reference.<p>What you'll find is that as you build things, you will learn a lot more about how to make your app come together.<p>Also, I disagree with the comment that it takes years to be able to do something decent with your newfound programming knowledge. Yes, it will take years before you can talk shop with the best of them, but as someone who has taken several languages (Spanish, Japanese, Latin) and played several instruments (piano, flute), I know it doesn't <i>have</i> take years to get past doing scales.<p>That's has more to do with ability to learn quickly and dedication.",1287239015

Am resubmitting in hopes of drawing some more feedback.<p>---<p>One of the major concerns for one of my iPhone friends who I am trying to convert to Android is the security that comes from the more open platform, and I explained the current security level.<p>So I began considering the idea of an App market that is heavily security focused. Each app is auto-reviewed by a system which looks for obvious threats to security. Then there would also be paid app-reviewers who go into the code and trace, explore, etc.<p>App inclusion in the market would be based off submissions by app authors, it would include a questionnaire (like the apple market), as well as an application fee (once per application, no matter number of rejections) etc. This is a clearly defined system, the apps permitted in this market are only ""apps"" and not ""games"" and no wallpapers, etc.<p>Customers would be able to subscribe to it and have access to the reviews, as well as subscribe to reviews by various reviewers.<p>So - what do you guys think? Is this feasible? Is there a business in this idea?",1287238817

1797973,comment,1795415,1797090,0,0,randomtask,,,"> I did the quick math on a napkin, and realized they were doing far worse as an NGO/charity than they would be to help people as a for-profit business.<p>You're making the assumption that creating jobs is better than providing access to education. This may be true in the short term, but probably not in the long term if access to education in that area is a problem. I would say that given that investment in education takes years to pay off anyway it is probably a good plan to invest sooner rather than later. However without knowing more about the specific case it's impossible to say either way.<p>I'm purely speculating on a hypothetical situation here, but from the point of view of the NGO it may make more sense to invest in education. Creating 120 jobs is no doubt a good thing, but if what is needed most in the area is a school, then investing in more jobs is not doing the greatest good. Creating jobs where the workforce is uneducated is not going to improve the standard of living greatly in that area over an extended period of time. Providing the means for the next generation to obtain better jobs or have the education necessary to start their own businesses might. Maybe the NGO is playing the long game?<p>Also if they make a success of this model, running a cafe to fund a school, and prove that they can make it work then it will probably be easier for them to get access to funds to replicate that success elsewhere. This could easily have longer term benefits than creating a small amount of jobs. Not to mention that this model doesn't have to be replicated by that NGO.",1287237929

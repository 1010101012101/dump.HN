Nowadays its all about short headlines or very shocking bits (partially because of computer-based news consumption behavior and partially because of breadth of availability).  Catering to the instant and very short nature of news consumption involves a greater indulgence in sensationalism.  Google contributed to this insofar as it allowed us to select what sources and what articles to read based on the title or blurb.<p>I wonder, at a deeper level, if the political divide in the US is fueled by the ""bubble"" that google allows: many years ago, people read newspapers covering all points of view, but google news lets you select which sources you draw news from (allowing you to select only fox news and drudge report, for example)",1358974790

We want to create a price comparison app (trying to recreate the horrible experience of the decade old websites that currently do this) that compares prices of products across different websites. Naturally, I need to be monitoring prices and right now there is only few ways to do this. One is through API, which not every retailer has and is also very challenging to be trying to integrate API of hundreds, if not thousands, of different retailers.<p>The other way is to scrape prices from retailer's websites. And the last but definitely the best way is to create API that lets the retailers integrate into their system and send their inventory data to your database (which is what Google Shopping does). But the problem here is trying to partner up with big retailers and get them to use your API. As a small startup with no virtually user base to start out with, is this even possible?<p>My solution was to crawl their online stores and get the prices until we can get a decent user base going and then approach these retailers and ask them to partner with us and use our built API. By showing our install base and usage data, we won't look like students working on some side project. The question is, before we get there, is there any legal repercussions that we should be worried about? Crawling and scraping prices isn't really the most ethical way to getting data but it's not like we're stealing content but rather driving traffic to their sites and helping them make more money, right? If say BestBuy has a sale on tv and we can let our users know about it then that would be helpful for them. Anyways, am I treading on thin line here? Any other solution people with insights to this matter can think of?<p>Thanks,

The reason dating is different is because there is an actual expectation of love, exclusivity, and longevity. There is absolutely no contract involved, thus these become the primary axis of the relationship. For example, note that if it is explicitly an open relationship, then the particular expectation of exclusivity disappears, in which case these actions would be legitimately considered ""less scummy"". With employment, there <i>is</i> a contract, and the other factors that you believe are influential to the relationship exist solely in your mind, and I will re-iterate, are in no way reciprocated by your employer. You will receive a bad surprise someday when you find out that the employer has no such notions of loyalty to you.<p>Finally, I am now really curious about your mindset.

  Why is crime rising in so many American cities? The answer 
  implicates one of the most celebrated antipoverty programs 
  of recent decades.

  ...

  About six months ago, they decided to put a hunch to the 
  test. Janikowski merged his computer map of crime patterns 
  with Bettss map of Section 8 rentals. Where Janikowski saw 
  a bunny rabbit, Betts saw a sideways horseshoe (He has a 
  better imagination, she said). Otherwise, the match was 
  near-perfect. On the merged map, dense violent-crime areas 
  are shaded dark blue, and Section 8 addresses are 
  represented by little red dots. All of the dark-blue areas 
  are covered in little red dots, like bursts of gunfire. The 
  rest of the city has almost no dots.

  Betts remembers her discomfort as she looked at the map.      
  The couple had been musing about the connection for months, 
  but they were amazedand deflatedto see how perfectly the 
  two data sets fit together. She knew right away that this 
  would be a hard thing to say or write. Nobody in the 
  antipoverty community and nobody in city leadership was 
  going to welcome the news that the noble experiment that 
  theyd been engaged in for the past decade had been 
  bringing the city down, in ways theyd never expected. But 
  the connection was too obvious to ignore, and Betts and 
  Janikowski figured that the same thing must be happening 
  all around the country.

With most other features, it can be mostly working and have a few bugs, but still be useful and functional. Bugs can be ironed out over the course of time.<p>Crypto is in a very real sense all-or-nothing. You either get it right, or you get it wrong. There is no inbetween. Given a weakness, the best attacks almost inevitably drop from requiring O(2^keylen) operations to something along the lines of O(messagelen) operations.<p>Worse, it is often <i>very</i> difficult to dig yourself out from a deep cryptographic hole that you've gotten yourself into. If you've done it right, you won't be able to do things like rehash user passwords without the user actually supplying his/her password. You won't be able to reencrypt data with new algorithms until the user supplies his/her key. And if you haven't thought ahead and added proper metadata to identify the algorithms and encodings you've used, your migration to any new architecture is going to be a <i>massive pain in the ass</i>. And even in the best case scenario, you will never be able to ""upgrade-in-place"" the algorithms and approaches you've used for users who've gone dormant. Worse again, if anyone has <i>already</i> gained access to encrypted data before you began the process of upgrading, they have literally an indefinite period of time with which to attack it.<p>Bad cryptography almost always implies a lack of people with a real cryptographic background. And that implies that at least one of: they don't value security as much as you think they do, or they <i>actually</i> think they know what they're doing and are utterly mistaken. Neither of which bodes well for real long-term solutions, and hints to an endless game of exploit whack-a-mole.<p>Everything I've read about the cryptography used in Mega leads me to believe it was implemented by well-intentioned amateurs who have tragically fallen victim to the Dunning-Kruger effect. Their use of cryptography amounts to little more than advanced cryptographic voodoo  their approach is to cryptography what Deepak Chopra's approach is to quantum mechanics. It's little more than advanced cryptographic voodoo. I'll note also that they seem to be taking the exact stance you seem to be advocating: just writing glue around a sound cryptographic core. Except their glue code is pitifully insecure, combines primitives in nonstandard or cryptographically unsound ways, and uses primitives for operations they were never intended for and aren't suited for.<p>TL;DR, bad cryptography is forever.",1358972779

People used to occasionally rent out their place, or just let people stay there for free, but there was almost always some kind of social connection.<p>The removal of friction has allowed this to become far more widespread.  I personally believe that it most definitely has the capacity for harm.<p>I remember hearing about one incident recently in the california wine country where there are some fruit trees on a public easement.  Mostly residential, but lots of appeal to tourists.  The neighbors shared the trees as a commons, they'd take a bit, but leave plenty, and would informally contribute time and money to maintenance.  One day, the trees were stripped, completely, of any fruit.  It turned out that a couple of people renting a nearby house had stripped the trees.   The house, which had formerly been occupied by a family with kids, was now a full time vacation rental (at great profit for the owner) and was advertising ""fruit picking in the alleyway"" as one of the wonderful activities available to short term renters.<p>I know I risk sounding very trivial here, elevating little neighborhood squabbles about crab apples all out of proportion, but I think the story I heard really gets at the problem.  Long term residents, to use a vulgar expression, have to sleep where they shit.  Short termers don't.  The non-legal self-corrective mechanisms that used to provide social harmony, things we weren't even aware of, may be badly disrupted but a very large number of short term residents.  We're all willing to (or should be willing to) tolerate the occasional loud backyard party next door.  But would we want to have that go on every night, all summer, from vacationers looking to maximize their fun?  All of a sudden, we're using the law to regulate something that used to be managed less formally.  The law is a terrible tool, way worse than just talking to your neighbors, but when you have a new neighbor every three days,it may be all you've got.<p>And even when the short term vacationers are on their best behavior, there is still a loss.  There is also absolutely a loss when families who would like to know and socialize with long term neighbors, especially with children, start to get pushed out because they can't compete on price with people who plan to airbnb the crap out the old neighborhood. I don't have a link to this, but I read once that an economist estimated that good relations with the neighbors were worth about $50,000.<p>I remember PG writing about how new forms of property come into existence with new technologies, just as old ones can go away.  We may only become aware that there was this vaguely defined property we owned now that airbnb has found a way to cash in.  I really do think that the owner of many of these VRBOs are selling the neighborhood rather than the house itself, and they're harming the neighborhood in the process.<p>I'm more than ok with some use of airbnb, and obviously it opens up new benefits as well.  But I think it is very reasonable for communities to strongly resist widespread short term rentals in their neighborhoods.",1358972056

Users intuitively understand this, just like itd be strange to have a car you could drive anywhere, but you had to remove the wheels if you went outside a certain area (the so-called split license). Most theme authors and businesses in the WP community also understand this, in fact all of the theme shops on the commercial themes page and many of the most successful including WooThemes and StudioPress sell 100% GPL themes that protect all the rights of their users, and have been extremely successful doing so.<p>Its an author and developers choice to license all their code under the GPL, and its our choice to only promote, accept sponsorship, and accept speaking proposals from people who do so. Its not a personal thing, and the guidelines apply equally to everyone, and if someone who broke the guidelines in the past stopped tomorrow there would be no hard feelings (its not a blackball, which implies permanent exclusion, its just part of the social mores of our community).'<p>Does this remind you of anything?<p>Greater good, comply and you'll be OK, free == freedom for everyone, etc.<p>I really want to give Matt and the foundation a benefit of the doubt here, but they are making it very difficult.<p>I followed up with a question about the WP logo, which is bundled in the WP.org download but protected.<p>'The GPL is a license granted under copyright law, which is separate from a trademark, which WordPress and its logo are. Its totally allowed by the software license for someone to take the software and make a hosting service, they just have to have their own name for it, like Edublogs. (Some OS communities consider trademark restrictions too much as well, which is why theres a fork of Firefox called Iceweasel included in Debian.) In addition to the guidelines on the Foundation site, having the trademark also gives us a tool to take down phishing sites that target WordPress.org users, or people who set up theme directories at similar-to-WordPress domains where every download includes a malware backdoor.

The first thing that needs to happen is that Hal's effort (I assume he will be convening some kind of committee) will need to establish the facts and the timeline.

It just means that the few ""irrational"" women are disproportionately attracted to the humanities.",1193889371

You don't have to make 150k per year to have more than you need.<p>We had our first child when I was an undergrad and my wife was working.  My wife quit working and I graduated so that I could be paid to go to school rather than the other way around.  We bought a cute little home on a graduate stipend and had another child.  I graduated with a masters degree and worked for a year and we had another child.<p>I started my PhD a bit over 4 years ago and we have had two children since then, bringing the total up to 5.  We have always had more than we need and our children are doing great.  I'll graduate in a couple of years, perhaps after having a couple more kids and I think we'll have substantial savings.  My wife has never had to work and we have never relied on the state for health care or income.<p>Graduate school demands some focus but it is also extremely flexible.  I choose my schedule and it's been a great life.<p>The bottom line is that it doesn't cost that much to live comfortably and take care of children.  Choose what you want to do and then find a way to do it.<p>It might be wise, though, to look at home prices near the schools that you apply to . . .",1193889172

74932,comment,58025,58025,0,0,ncm,,,"No, modern science was invented by ibn al-Haytham a thousand years ago.  (Spellings vary, but include ""Alhazen"" and ""Alhacen"".)  He is generally credited with inventing modern optics (along with various geometric results), but the method he invented to give a firm foundation to his investigations into optics was what, today, we call science.  Bacon studied him.

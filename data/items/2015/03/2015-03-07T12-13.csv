AFAIK. GCM is not a &quot;true&quot; push service, it just provide an API that makes it seem like one.
Battery use is much higher for data, especially when you are in a location with bad connectivity.

One of the common problem was to seek for services, out of their domain and ended up paying high to corporates for these services.
Some of the problem which my fellow friends&#x27; startup faced.
1. For It startup, IPR would be a subject out of their domain and vice versa 
2. Few designer who just planned to start their own startups to print and sell their designs on merchandisable object. But
a) he doesn&#x27;t have funds to set up its printing unit. b) setup logistics.<p>We felt creating such a platform would be cool for both the service seekers and providers. Seekers can avail services from other startups - better service, low cost and customised to their needs. While Providers will have chance to be discovered by other startups, who otherwise would not have discovered them and might have ended of paying high to corporates for services.<p>Before we move ahead, I wanted to be sure that if startups really feel the need of such marketplace? Do others face such problems?",1425730201

The brokers would then just mark up their prices when they decide to sell to the little guys?<p>I would like to change the way expired domains are reintroduced into the marketplace.  It seems like the best 
expired domain names are kept by the domain registrar if the 
owner doesn&#x27;t pay their bill?  Why is Godaddy/generic domain 
registers allowed to buy expired domain names before the general public even sees them?  (I might have got the process
wrong? Please correct me if needed!)<p>If anyone really know the process of buying an expired domain 
name--the actual steps;  I would really like to know how the 
game works.<p>The first question I have is this; I buy a premium name from
Godaddy.  I forget about the name and all the renew/reclaim 
dates?  After ICANN determines it can go back on the market, 
why do the good names always seem to be bought by domain registrars before they hit a site like expireddomains.ooo?<p>I heard it has something to do with Verisign, and domain brokers type companies that flood ICANN web servers with 
buy requests from multiple locations, but would like 
a detailed walk through.<p>The process of snagging a good expired domain has been cloaked in secrecy for too long.<p>p.s. I did a little research and I answered one of my questions.  The question I asked was how Godaddy retains the 
best expired domian names?<p>The answer is Domain Warehousing.  &quot;Domain name warehousing is the practice of registrars obtaining control of expired domain names already under their management, with the intent to hold or “warehouse” names for their own use and/or profit.&quot;<p>This practice should be modified immediately!  I don&#x27;t understand why on earth they would be able to keep these 
names?<p>One other thing, the cost ICANN charges Godaddy for the privilege of registering a domain name is approximately 
$7.00 and change.  Every other dollar above the $7.42? is 
revenue.",1425730107

A quick Google shows this from the census bureau:<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/mrts/www/data/html/06Q3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/mrts/www/data/html/06Q3.html</a><p>|Total retail sales for the third quarter of 2006 were estimated at $991.7 billion, an increase of 0.7 percent (X0.3%) from the second quarter of 2006.<p>so, assuming that sales are close to $900 billion per quarter, I think that we can safely say that retail sales probably do business in the 2-4 <i> trillions </i> of dollars per year.",1196963853

86708,comment,86688,86688,0,0,tipjoy,,,"Yes, it is technically inaccurate for people to view the back button as an undo. However until new browsers come out that are designed for web applications, this will continue to be an issue regardless. As long as you judiciously use AJAX - only use it to power a true 'app' - you may largely overcome the issue, as people who feel they're working in an application may not be as inclined to hit back when trying to undo.

86702,comment,86506,86506,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I was thinking the other day about why American scientists are so successful, given that they tend to work much less diligently than the Chinese or Indian scientists I've known. Of course issues of funding and infrastucture have a lot to do with it, but I think there's something else as well...<p>As a lazy American I spend a lot of time wandering around campus or at home not-working, instead I dream up new ways to adjust my methods so that they take less time and effort. In the long run, tinkering with methods leads to a lot of innovation. It's this link between a tolerance for laziness and creativity that has made American science so successful.",1196962736

Most enterprise software sells in the $1000 - $100,000 range depending on what you're selling.  In fact, you can charge even more for bundling it with VMware.  ""It's a feature!""<p>Another plus for doing it this way, the very fact that you're using a virtual appliance makes your product buzzword compliant. ""Virutualization"" makes your product tre' cutting edge--very sexy for CIO types to talk about how they just spent $50,000 on the latest tech.  <p>",1196962663

Many of the warrants are on people who are not its citizens.<p>There sure are problems in places like Ferguson, but this comparison seems not entirely honest. Why do you compare arrest warrants of a single municipal court vs. number of residents in that small municipality, and then the arrest warrants of a much larger municipal court system and number of residents in that much larger municipal system? Of course these ratios are different, because by nature a single, small municipality issues many arrest warrants for people who are not residents, while a larger system mostly handles people living inside its constituency.<p>Compare St. Louis metropolitan area and Boston metropolitan area, then you see the scale of problems. It is there, so there should be no need to do flimsy tricks on apples and oranges. The war on drugs sure brings problems, and this is one symptom.",1426760862

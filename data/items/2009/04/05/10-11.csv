547270,comment,547079,547079,0,0,froo,,,"I've already replied to this thread but I thought I would add another anecdote about using ads. This is just my personal experience, but I think can underline that you really need to be creative.<p>Personally, I think online ads are mostly a waste of money unless you get a good, measurable conversion from those ads.<p>Using Adsense for mostly branding or signing up free users is, in my opinion, the wrong approach since everyone is doing it. It ends up a war of attrition with who has the bigger budget, with the only winner being Google.<p>That's not to say you can't do very interesting things with online ads from a branding perspective. I've used online ads to great effect to create notoriety, the ad units themselves didn't increase traffic, it was the word of mouth associated with what I was doing with them.<p>Last year when I was spearheading the campaign to get Rick Astley the Best Act Ever award at MTV's Europe Music Awards, a bit of a rivalry occurred between the Tokio Hotel fans and the Rick Astley fans - I used this to my advantage.<p>Essentially, I leveraged Google's Adsense to plaster simple flashing (annoying) ""Vote 4 Rick"" ads all over other fansites around october 20th when the site's traffic was flat.<p>Post's below contain screenshots that blog readers were sending in of ads in action.<p><a href=""http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/20/please-stand-by/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/20/please-stand-by/</a><p><a href=""http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/23/this-oozes-irony/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/23/this-oozes-irony/</a><p>All up, I think the ad spend over a 10 day period was about $20 .. it was around that, I don't remember it costing me too much.<p>You can see the traffic increase to the site as people became interested again with what was occurring and telling their friends of the pranks that were happening.<p><a href=""http://files.marklancaster.org/images/bestactever_traffic_oct1-nov11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.marklancaster.org/images/bestactever_traffic_oc...</a><p>In one case, I managed to embed a rickrolling flash ad in a certain Tokio Hotel Fansite, belonging to a critic of our efforts. She got so angry that she actually disabled advertising for her site so that I couldn't get ads in there.<p><a href=""http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/26/unappreciated-gift/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/26/unappreciated-gift/</a><p>I also started targeting certain fansites directly, specifically one fan fiction site because they used Project Wonderful and the Ad unit was relatively cheap.<p>This is the message that the admin of that fansite sent to me via project wonderful. I found it to be highly amusing and this is the first time that I have made this public. I literally had every ad spot on their site filled with a flashing ""Vote 4 Rick"" ad which cost me the minimum $5 for project Wonderful and lasted about 4 days.<p><pre><code>  Hello Mark Lancaster,\n\n  Darcy Gilmore has sent you a new message! The message is:\n\n  ---------------------\n  Subject: Your Ad on our TH Site\n\n  I love that you're advertising on our site, it's ingenious! Keep up\n  the hilarious work, it's making all of our douchebag members foam at\n  the mouth, and nothing pleases me more than that.\n</code></pre>\nSo, I guess the overall message is get creative. Create Purple Cows. Nothing beats word of mouth dollar for dollar.",1238928501

But, the article is actually a fairly well-written short story.  It is personable and does a good job of describing one person experience with an iPhone.  The author also does a good job of personifying the iPhone.<p>Generally, people who love the iPhone love it because it is a cute device that brings them joy with every shiny icon, round corner, and animation.  Generally, people who are frustrated by the iPhone are tormented by things like the virtual keyboard and dropped calls on AT&T's network.<p>The real take-away is that for a product to be successful, it has to be functional, but it also has to make the user ""feel good"".  It has to be delightful.  And what is delightful to one person may be frustrating to another person.",1238928378

I guess, and all the girl developer are using it.<p>Groovy combines Java's practicality and the fun of using a dynamic language with advance feature, like closure! or Groovy's definition of it<p>Python, well, yea okay they have Django and TwistedMatrix, other than that I believe Python can destroy more careers than Java, C++ and Visual basic combined, the community is so dry and the language is so boring ... which I believe makes it an effective deterrent to any free-spirited individual<p>Python was one of the first languages I tried, and I have to say that it knocked me out! and I am still recovering! The Python community just killed my enthusiasm to be a programmer.<p>What I believe killed Ron's career, is that he never cared if Programming was fun! And it seems he still don't!\nLisp is smart, intellectual and intrigues you to think, but not very usable and the brackets thingie, its annoying.\nPython is not thought provoking at all but very usable and practical.<p>Perl, Ruby and Groovy are both!",1238928175

It's more like Skype + VNC, but a VNC that works much better.<p>This is the working pattern, you and the other side both see the same screen and can type and use the cursor at the same time, while doing high quality voice chat. So you have for example a terminal with vi opened and code while talking, then open Firefox to reload and check what happened to the application after the modifications and so on.<p>All this very fluid under a common DSL line.

Each circuit is usually 16-20 amps, this is in my experience about 8-10 2-3U servers (your hardware should have wattage and amperage documentation).  You can get higher power density (and sometimes cheaper prices) if you use DC powered hardware.  You can get more circuits, but they often charge incrementally more because as the servers per square foot ratio goes up, cooling requirements go up also (you pay for cooling as part of the price for the physical space), and the power limits are a way to help keep that under control, predictable, and homogenous across the datacenter.",1238925765

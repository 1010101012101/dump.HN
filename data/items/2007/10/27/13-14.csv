Just wanting to know how will they sound is a very strong motivation.<p>You can listen to some of what i've been doing (music tracks) if you are that curious:<p><a href=""http://myspace.com/rugoso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myspace.com/rugoso</a><p>Most of it its done with my software, i just use audiohijack and logic to masterize - add ""punch"" - and to do some edits - cut the bad parts, put together the good parts.<p>The track called ""Setup Seeker"" is an exception, there i only used a sequencer and a midi controller I made, but the sound actually comes from commercial software.<p>I realize its not really good, I'm working on getting better at it ;)<p>Some one else doing music apps here?",1193492124

There isn't a reason why this can't happen. I'm not sure about images in gmail (why not send a link?) but applications like fauxto can get your images from links. All these i-products are made by one company, a web company can make its programs just as intertwined. As a parallel to your example I think a fair number of web applications work with google calendar. <p>Re: But 1-4: If your company wants to work at the stage people get data off their devices then a web startup makes no sense. Once they've done that though - the first things they want to do is share it. Thats why the internet is huge, there are other people on it.",1193492091

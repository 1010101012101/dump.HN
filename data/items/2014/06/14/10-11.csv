7892525,comment,7892242,7892501,8,0,pedrocr,,,"Most &quot;4K&quot; is really 3840x2160 which is exactly twice 1920x1080. So scaling 4K resolution to a 1080p screen is easy, just average every four pixels into one. This screen though has 1/3 more pixels in both dimensions so scaling is actually harder.<p>Since a Nexus 5 is already at 445PPI with a 1080p screen I don&#x27;t see any advantage of going 4K on this form factor. On a large tablet perhaps, but not on a phone.",1402743466

If I talk to someone giving up their startup, I&#x27;d ask them to hold on for some more time and keep trying.<p>It has been more than 6 months since we wound up our startup. I have plenty of reasons why it failed. Team conflicts, No focussed idea - and many more. But whatever reasoning I come up with, what hits me when I gave up on my startup and even now, is my lack of persistence and determination. I&#x27;ve failed...<p>I&#x27;ve moved on physically.

I&#x27;m in an emerging market in the middle east (Saudi).<p>I&#x27;m the founder of one of the very few funded Internet companies in the country. Spent the last 24 months fundraising with little luck. My God what a brutal time it&#x27;s been.<p>When the company ran out of money, I talked with our leading investor about my need for temporary employment (we were talking with a couple of VCs at the time and I didn&#x27;t want to commit before hearing from them). He ran an Internet company as well, and I worked with them for a while.<p>I did that for about six months till I knew the investments were not coming. After that I polished my resume and started contacting people and companies about possible full time jobs.<p>The first question that came to my mind was about which type position to apply for. Before starting the company, I was a software engineer - so I could always fall back on that. But the years I spent working on the startup forced me to be a generalist. It really worried me to think I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of position I should be seeking.<p>It came down to three main options,<p>1- managing a software product team (which aligns well with my passion for building things) at a software company.<p>2- working with investment companies interested in Internet/tech investment. What helped me in this area was that I did my homework when we were discussing the term sheet for our seed investment. And that I blogged and spoke about the experience (Arabic content about the topic is very rare, aside from general entrepreneurship hype).<p>3- working in digital marketing. This drew upon our experience with digital marketing our product. This was my least favorite option, but it had the most market demand.<p>One of the things that really helped me in this job hunt was that I was visible to the local industry in my attempts to promote the company. I spoke at events about lessons learned, I blogged about the various experiences... Etc.",1402741890

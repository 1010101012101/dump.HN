I'm not sure how much that really pushes society forward. At least Elon Musk is doing something truly socially useful with his money.<p>I suppose my brother and I are great examples of your point: I left engineering to become a lawyer, and he took his physics degree to an investment bank. More money in law and banking. But is engineering or programming really more socially valuable, as practiced? Like many engineers, I used to work in defense contracting--I feel someone more socially valuable as a lawyer, and that's saying a lot. Where does a talented programmer go these days? Silicon Valley? Where the big, world-changing work everyone seems engaged in is exploiting private information for advertising profit? I'm not sure if I believe that's any better for society.",1350194264

If the government doesn't step in, those huge companies band together to screw regular people (see, e.g., tech companies colluding to keep engineer salaries down through). If the government does step in, those huge companies co-opt it through lobbying.<p>I think the solution may be a smaller government that is more aggressive about enforcement. Make it extremely difficult to grow companies larger than say $1 billion. Be much more aggressive about breaking up burgeoning monopolies instead of waiting until they get too powerful.",1350194154

4650787,comment,4648982,4648982,4,0,mschaecher,,,"Here's a plausible explanation for what is happening:<p>For any given user on facebook, there is a limited amount of promoted posts that facebook will show in their feed at any given time/day so that their feeds don't become overwhelmed with promoted/sponsored content.<p>So like other ad platforms, i.e. auction based, you are competing for that limited space with other brands and pages that are promoting/sponsoring content. If everyone is competing for the high value fans, i.e. us based fans, it would be easy to get ""bid out"" by putting in to low of an amount.<p>But since no one is likely targeting India/Indonesia/Philippines, those are cheap. And if your fans there are all that are available to you because of bid optimization constraints, facebook will most likely end up sending a disproportionate amount of your views to those fans.<p>Now for some sample math: If you have, let's say 5 friends in Indonesia, let's see how that could play out.\nIndonesia and Phillipines facebook users generally have more fb friends on avg then the rest of the world. Call it 170.\nSo your potential audience of 'friends of fans' in indonesia is = 850.<p>Since not many, if any brands, are attempting to target those 850 people, you could saturate them with your promoted/sponsored content. Users in that part of the world also 'like' stuff more frequently and at a higher volume.\nNo let's say that you get 15 likes from those 850 'friends of fans'. That like action will create an organic story in those peoples' friends newsfeeds. So 15 people, with avg of 170 friends each, like that sponsored post and an organic feed story is seen on avg by about 14% of any users friends you could reach 357 more organic impressions.<p>That cycle can continue on and on.",1350193745

I recently checked out a similar issue when I noticed the large number of foreign likes and comments on the wall posts of tech people with large followings.<p>Turns out that as Facebook got hundreds of millions of new users in the Middle East and Indonesia (4th largest country now) they didn't separate out their recommendation system and were promoting US based tech people as someone to follow.<p>So now whenever somebody I follow, like Mike Arrington or Shira Lazar posts something, 80% of the comments and likes and most of their new followers are from people in these countries who often have no idea what they are talking about and don't know what is going on.<p>It has really made Facebook messy for these folk, since you can't easily delete 100,000 followers from Saudi Arabia[1]<p>So anyway, this has the graph all mixed up, because now Facebook thinks that all these people are 6 degrees closer to you than they really are, since they likely follow somebody that you follow - hence why they are shown the promoted post. This all goes back to an error made in the first few weeks of pushing new subscribers.<p>To add to that, there is a cultural gap in the translation of 'like' in some other languages. For eg. in some areas it is considered unpolite not to click the like button, while others use it as a form of 'mark as read', or 'seen this'.<p>The like and comment activity just happens to also be an antire magnitude higher from the people from these nations, and they happen to now only be a degree or two away from you in the Facebook graph because of a follow promotion error.<p>[1] They are also ridiculously friendly, I am sure I am not the only person who has received a message about 'want to make friends' from somebody at a Gulf or Saudi university.",1350191386

However, this issue of individual medical test subjects does not in any way prevent the identification of the particular facility at which the research was done, nor does it in any way prohibit other researchers from discovering that information on their own.<p>It is extremely interesting that Dr. Boaler believes her work falls under 45 CFR 46.116 since that means she has retained records documenting that she acquired this written consent and made these disclosures to all her test subjects, in addition to a rather vast number of other requirements that are far above and beyond the normal protocol for testing curriculums in schools. It's curious too given that 46.101(b) of the statute specifically excludes educational studies from the requirements:<p>> (b) Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this policy:<p>> (1) Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving normal educational practices, such as (i) research on regular and special education instructional strategies, or (ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.<p>There can be no doubt that this exclusion applies to the scope of this study given that it is a classroom study on efficacy of math curriculums.",1350191357

Since there's no license information, third parties (ie, people who aren't you) should assume that they have no right to use it (that it's proprietary since there's nothing offering other rights).  You've said it's open source, but under what terms can I (or TaxCloud) use it?<p>A lot of open source licenses don't require attribution.  If you had licensed this under the GPL2 or MIT licenses, would you still consider what they did wrong?<p>It's crappy (in the plagiarism way) to take someone else's code and try to make people think you wrote it.  You haven't explicitly licensed your code under any license and so, to be conservative, third parties should operate under the assumption that the code is proprietary.  However, many times open source does allow you to fork something and make it your own.  For example, Joomla is a fork of Mambo.  The codebase has evolved, copyright notices have been changed, and there isn't credit back to Mambo on the website.  If it were a less known project, many people might assume that it all originated with Joomla (and, in fact, with Mambo seemingly dead and it having been quite a while since the fork, I'm guessing a lot of newer people wouldn't find out).<p>Often times, open source licenses don't require attribution.  It might have been that the person at TaxCloud got your email telling them about your open source project and assumed an MIT license for it.  One shouldn't assume things like that, but people make more egregious errors.<p>Anyway, it would be nice to know what license the open source code is governed by (and this is true for many more projects that just don't have a license file) and I hope you're able to resolve the situation in a way which makes things better for you.",1350191284

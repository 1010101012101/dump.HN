7719717,comment,7717742,7719609,1,0,dfc,,,"This is not something I reasoned out in my bedroom. It is knowledge passed on from someone to me who learned it from someone else and then reinforced during my own experience. The next time you see some outdoor furniture, picnic table, adirondack chair, etc take a peak at the feet. Then give it a wiggle and for bonus points pick it up and move/rotate it five or six inches. The obvious answer is that the smaller leg means that you you do not need to find as large of a flat area for the leg to stand on. It means that the leg can rest inside of a little divot on your lawn. In addition to reducing wobble it makes it less likely that someone stubs their toe and trips on the corner, but I am less sold on that one.<p>More importantly, <i>it is just wood, go try it yourself.</i> If you don&#x27;t have the saw blade on a SAK/leatherman and a piece of scrap wood try scissors and a spaghetti box or a couple of pieces cardboard taped together. &quot;Learning&quot; something from a comment by that ornery dude on HN is not the same thing as seeing it in practice.",1399618691

7719707,comment,7716333,7719048,1,0,Zancarius,,,"> EDIT: looks like 4.13.1 will also have a check box to disable Baloo!<p>FINALLY. Thanks for digging this up. Having no means of presently disabling it through the UI seems unnecessarily user-hostile.<p>> Baloo had decided that it would index all of my data files which are huge (multiple GB) which was going poorly for it and for me.<p>As I mentioned in my previous comment, Baloo seemed to happily go about its business indexing precisely everything I told it not to, even to the extent of ignoring child directories of those I specified in the ignored directory list. I suspect that was a bug, but considering the suggestion in lieu of a button to disable the feature was &quot;just add your home directory and it&#x27;ll do the right thing&quot; (which didn&#x27;t work) is counter productive.<p>Sigh.<p>I can understand being excited about a new feature and (possibly) being one of its only proponents, and occasionally something good surfaces from such thankless chores. But I sometimes have to wonder what the motivation is to staunchly defend decisions that seem rather... myopic. Ordinarily I wouldn&#x27;t care, but pounding the heck out of partitions and NFS mounts to do something that I can do quickly and simply with grep and find is just insanity.<p>On the other hand, now I understand why xapian-core is listed as a dependency.",1399618543

7719649,comment,7717093,7719558,2,0,Pitarou,,,"I once read a textbook introducing the theory of algorithms that started with the Fibonacci series. The author gave a formal definition, and translated this directly into a naive, recursive algorithm.  Then he showed how to improve the algorithm with memoization. This was a real revelation to me: using this one simple, generally applicable transformation, all kinds of algorithms can be improved.<p>Then the author introduced the iterative Fibonacci algorithm, and formally proved that the iterative and recursive algorithms were equivalent.  But the author failed to explain where that iterative algorithm came from: there was no general purpose tool like memoization that could be used to derive the iterative form from the recursive form. I still remember the intellectual disappointment.<p>Now, with co-recursion and a couple of other techniques, that gap is finally bridged. Using co-recursion, I can derive the stream algorithm directly from the recursive definition. And then I can apply deforestation techniques and tail-call optimization to derive the iterative algorithm from the stream algorithm. That&#x27;s a pretty powerful intellectual toolset, don&#x27;t you think?",1399617139

You should consider resigning and getting a new job.<p>Insubordination will not only put you at risk for losing your job on an involuntary basis, but in a precarious legal position should you be fired. (Your company will have the ability to deny you unemployment, and/or provide a reasonable professional reference.)<p>That being said, the way to handle your situation is to &quot;skip-level&quot; your boss. Most established companies provide for this (potentially via the HR function). The purpose of a skip-level is to raise issues internally that are important to the business but may be bottlenecked by a conflict of interest in middle-management.<p>This is a situation that needs to be handled with discretion. You don&#x27;t want to trigger an emotional reaction from anyone about this--stay away from ad-libbing stuff like &quot;I think our engineers are lazy in the wrong way&quot;--you simply want to resolve a remediable inefficiency.<p>The key considerations for you are (1) establishing credibility, if its not already evident to your 1-over-1 manager; (2) being forthright with the risks (and fairly treat your immediate manager&#x27;s stated position/s); and (3) finding a way to implement a decision without making your boss look &quot;lazy in the wrong way&quot; {etc}.<p>The question to you is really about the upsides to taking a pro-active approach?<p>The standard for that upside should be reasonably high. Can you deliver results to both your immediate boss and your 1-over-1 boss by doing this? If so, and if this will decrease any disfunction/toxicity (rather than trigger it), that is more persuasive.<p>If this is just going to inflame a bad situation, then again you may want to just look elsewhere before sinking more energy into a dead-end rabbit hole.<p>The downsides to doing a skip-level are mitigated by the discretion of your HR and 1-over-1 manager if this is simply declined. The messier edge case is where they decide to implement your fix, but something goes wrong technically or in the political implementation that damages your own reputation (for showing good judgement).<p>The bigger picture question: if the culture is &quot;rotten&quot;,  what are the odds that your skip-level is an equally un-satisfactory decisionmaker?<p>A &quot;cowboy&quot; implementation (with no approval) is unlikely to trigger a cultural renaissance you have multiple layers of bad management. It is possible, but remember someone up above you thinks those guys above you are &quot;decent-enough&quot;.

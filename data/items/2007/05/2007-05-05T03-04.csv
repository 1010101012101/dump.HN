19673,comment,19672,19672,0,0,papersmith,,,"I noticed that there are plenty of ways to setup single-system-image clusters for high performance computing, and I'm wondering if it's practical for web farms.  It seems to be rarely used in the latter context, though I can see several advantages off the top of my head:<p>- You can write your web app as if it only runs on one machine, so you don't have to worry about distributed session storage.  For some continuation-based web frameworks, serializing continuations seems pretty messy.<p>- You can use your RDBMS's own cache buffer instead of memcached, since it can be transparently distributed by the OS.  So your app can simply talk to the database directly.<p>- From the propagandas, most SSI systems promise to automatically detect new nodes and add it to its pool of resources.  So this saves you some time deploying your software as you scale up.<p>I was wondering if anyone here has any theoretical knowledge or experience in running SSI clusters, and how it compares to the classic load-balancer/web-servers/memcached/database-server configuration in serving multiuser web apps.<p>Thanks!",1178336644

19663,comment,19661,19661,0,0,vlad,,,"This is especially useful for the New page which changes more frequently than startup news.  One can then see what the New page looked like 1 hour ago, two hours ago, etc.  Kind of like Justin.TV.<p>All one has to do is limit the output on the new page to just the stories that existed before the date/time.  The actual links and dates would not change, so even if one wants to see the news page of 3 days ago, the age of the submission would still show correctly for each link.<p>And, it's easier and faster than scrolling down and clicking Next like on Digg or Reddit.  You simply click back one hour and the previous view loads, without changing the location of the back link, so you can keep clicking it to go back three hours.  Much more intuitive.<p>I think this would work great for the new page, but I'm not sure how well it would work for Startup News.",1178335356
19662,comment,19446,19576,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I look at it this way:<p>Intelligence is nothing more or less than a certain set of behaviors.  Things like curiosity, experimentation, analysis & reflection, precision of thought, voracious reading, etc.  It's genetic because behavior is genetic.  But genetic != immutable: it's possible to change your intelligence by changing your behavior.<p>It's really habits that matter.  Somebody could be born predisposed towards learning lots of things, and then gradually become unintelligent because they believe it just doesn't matter.  Or they could be born frighteningly intelligent and then gradually go crackpot by falling victim to confirmation bias and only seeking out information that fits their pre-existing mental models (Noam Chomsky and Stephen Wolfram fit this description, and IMNSHO a prominent YC founder is in danger of going down this road).  Or they could be born normal, but have parents that encourage them to try things out and explore the world around them.  Or they could be born dumb, but choose to adopt habits that involve taking in prodigious amounts of information.",1178335184

It's so great not to have to switch back and forth between different windows (different desktops, for me; I use Desktop Manager), but there are little things that keep bugging me, like the ""open in same tab"" thing with the terminal.<p>Another problem I have with it is overeager completion, but I suppose I'll just get used to this -- I was never a fan of Dreamweaver, which also does this.",1178334841

Also, the Varicella vaccine has been added to the standard ""MMR"" lineup (now MMRV). It's hard to get excited about wiping out ""chickenpox"" but the vaccine should reduce the incidence of deaths due to complications related to infection in children and especially in adults, as well as shingles and other illnesses related to infection.

We don't know that yet, and may not know for some time. It will be nearly impossible to eradicate HIV without prevention. If this child has unprotected sex as an adult thinking that it is cured, is that safe? We don't know. Maybe the virus will show again in their adulthood.<p>However, if a vaccine is found and we can prove the vaccination works, that provides a lot more security. Because of many of our parents getting vaccinated, Smallpox got to the point where their children (us) didn't have to get vaccinated. That is where we need to get with HIV. Because of AZT, etc. people just assume it is more of an annoyance now, like Herpes that can be managed.

The result is that if you want to use UUID v1 off-the-shelf with ""shard IDs"" you are more than welcome to do so, not just in the ""analogously-equivalent"" sense but in the ""to the letter of the spec"" sense.

Translation:<p><pre><code>   Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den 
  In a stone den was a poet called Shi, who was a lion addict, and had resolved to eat ten lions.
  He often went to the market to look for lions.
  At ten o'clock, ten lions had just arrived at the market.
  At that time, Shi had just arrived at the market.
  He saw those ten lions, and using his trusty arrows, caused the ten lions to die.
  He brought the corpses of the ten lions to the stone den.
  The stone den was damp. He asked his servants to wipe it.
  After the stone den was wiped, he tried to eat those ten lions.
  When he ate, he realized that these ten lions were in fact ten stone lion corpses.
  Try to explain this matter.

Recently, I have decided that the cost may not be worth the benefit if future technology is considered.<p>The future is going to involve self driving busses, self driving cars, self driving trucks etc.<p>The primary thing I enjoy about the train is the additional space.  Fundmantally, that is the problem with trains too.  If they jammed people on a train the way they jam them on a bus, it should drive the profits up. Amtrak sells out a lot of routes in the north east while competing with $20 bus tickets.<p>In 20 years, self driving busses should replace trains as the up front cost is lower and the market is freer.<p>I'd argue that any money considered spent on trains should be put to better use.<p>(Added)<p>I think it is safe to assume all vehicles will run on electric and batteries in the distant future, further reducing train advantages.",1362359133

It's amazing how a few lines of code managed to bring down Cloudfare, they could have told us anything and nobody would have been able to question it; instead they gave us the truth and I really respect that. They didn't blame the intern, they didn't blame their hardware or make an excuse about a power outage. In terms of honesty Cloudfare seems to be leading the way regardless of their public credibility or image being tainted.

5315904,comment,5313989,5313989,1,0,chamboo,,,"Hi there.  Just wanted you to know that you shouldn't be embarrassed/ashamed about the stuff that you're putting out there.  A lot of people don't want to admit their struggles or often won't post something for fear that someone will consider them stupid, not gifted/insightful, etc...  These fears are illogical and usually stem from personal views/beliefs on intelligence.<p>Especially if you were always ahead of the class in school, and could get away with less studying than your peers, you are prone to this way of thinking.  The fact that you cannot grasp something immediately and innately may be disturbing to your brain, and it will easily get overwhelmed by the sheer scale of it all.<p>Just want to tell you that if you are able to recognize these fears/doubts, and continue what you are doing in spite of them, you will reach your destination.  You are still incredibly young.  I am 30 and not even to the point where you are, congratulations.  You have 6 years to fuck around before we're on even playing ground.<p>It may sound stupid, but what has helped me deal with overwhelming emotions is the fact that we can only be successful one day at a time.  If you have a successful day, then you are on the path to being successful at whatever you're wanting to do.  Even if you don't exactly know what it is yet.<p>Focus on having successful days, and eventually you will look up and be amazed at what you were able to achieve.  Also, realize how much time you spend looking for those silver bullets-""Am I reading the right stuff, is there a way to get there faster?  Is there a better way?""  These are all important to think about, but they can also be used for reasons to do nothing, which is not a good formula for success.<p>As one successful dev once told me, there are tons of ways to get there.  There isn't a better or best path that anyone really knows of.  I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it seems to be true.  I think a lot of times, worrying about finding the best way to get there is the best form of procrastination.  You fool yourself into believing it is better to find a better way than to actually do something.  I think the best advice when you come to a point like this is to think of something you want to create and just take some time off to learn how to create it.  You may realize along the way that there are certain things that you really don't care about learning for the time being.  If you look at all the different responses from HN users, you will see that every response is unique.  Some may suit you, but some won't.  I think it's really going to be up to you to find what you need and what you don't.  The only way to find out is to do the work.<p>Cheers, and I love the website you created.  Keep up the good work and remember to not be too self conscious about the stuff you put out there.",1362358920

Don't bite them all off at the same time.<p>For example, build an app that keeps track of your diet*. Do the frontend first, make it all static. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Those all go together pretty well. Don't worry about anything more than that. No Backbone, no Angular, etc.<p>Then write the API needed to provide and fill in the data to replace the static data you used above.

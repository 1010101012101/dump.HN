I have been in a similar boat as you.<p>Back in 2013, my daughter was born and within 2 days I was laid off from my position as IT Manager at a small MSP in Dallas.<p>No college degree at the time, no savings, wife and I were not working. The one thing I did have though (fortunately) was experience in the industry - about 8 years of IT experience (dev, systems engineering, architecture, management).<p>I freaked out initially - the stress of a new kid, no money kind of ate at me. For not only was I a dad (a young one at that), but also now my family has no income (wife was on maternity leave).<p>The first thing I did was head to a local coffee shop and busted out my laptop.<p>I hadn&#x27;t edited my resume in a few years. I deleted everything and started over. I knew this crappy employer wasn&#x27;t going to dictate my families future. I also knew what I was worth.<p>I immediately got on LinkedIn and started connecting with everyone I knew/asked for references and then started connecting with hiring managers at prospective companies.<p>I created a burner phone number (google voice number) and used this on my resume - then created a Monster, Dice and Careerbuilder accounts (to attract headhunters) and filled out those profiles entirely.<p>Having not spent a lot of time in a few years looking at salaries in different segments of IT, I spent a few hours figuring out what in the hell I wanted to do - and what would make me some $$$.<p>I found that in the Dallas/Fort Worth area (at the time), Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and VMware were heavily searched terms by recruiters on LinkedIn and Indeed.com.. I started looking at what I could do to leverage my current knowledge/skills and find a lucrative position.<p>After spending a few hours researching, I found that I could leverage my systems (Windows/*Nix) administration experience and help developers deploy their code. I was pretty good with Python and was interested in learning Ruby.<p>Bingo - DevOps!!<p>I found what interested me - the best of both worlds and I started targeting my job searches/applications towards that.<p>By the end of the day, I had a call from a local recruiting agency looking for Cloud and DevOps engineers. By the next morning I was on the phone with the hiring manager - and by the end of the day (3 phone interviews later) I had an offer in my inbox ($90K more than my last job).<p>In summary:
What you went through completely sucks. Don&#x27;t beg. Show people that you can get shit done. Do the work, be the prize.",1441871904

You cut a key that is identical to your key, except you vary the depth of a single cut. You repeat this until this new key works in your lock. That gives you the master key cut depth of one part of the key. You repeat this process forthe rest of the positions.

He can&#x27;t afford to make a habit out of this kind of post. In that sense, I agree with you. Professionalism is important in terms of him getting out of the hole he&#x27;s in and getting a proper gig, but if he had been professional with this post I&#x27;d never have seen it or read it.<p>Brokedev: My advice would be to follow the recommendations given by &quot;ecliptik&quot; above. Work on your professional development: your resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. Then market yourself like crazy with a good personal blog (showing what you&#x27;re doing, learning, and experimenting with) and Twitter. Follow programmers you admire, and use Lists on Twitter to create a custom list of RoR developers so you can check out what they&#x27;re working on and filter out noise. That won&#x27;t be hard to do. Then keep at it. Make sure you&#x27;re programming every day. Get involved in an open source project, and get your code on GitHub.",1441869811

The lumps are caused by variations in the crust and mantle, like mountain ranges, valleys, and variations in rock types.<p>It is possible to map the lumps using a tool called a gravimeter, which is basically an extremely sensitive mass balance. This is one way in which we do observe (and use) tiny variations in gravity on Earth.",1441868539

In California, for example, the minimum that a programmer needs to be paid to be considered overtime exempt is $86k/year. It can become fairly expensive to pay for overtime, so that $86k tends to be roughly the starting salary for lower level jobs.<p>Definitely a case where OP needs to do their due diligence to find average salaries for their location to use during salary negotiations.",1441868425

You&#x27;d probably want to know how many heads the drive has to determine how to stripe it in the most inconvenient way possible.  I think going beginning to middle on a single platter and back for each file would be the best way to get the worst performance for each file.  That&#x27;ll make sure it has to seek for each subsequent block and it can&#x27;t inadvertently get read-ahead since it has to back track all the time, and the separation should be far enough that it won&#x27;t get it on the in order blocks either.<p>EDIT:
Just realized that I don&#x27;t think this can be done through normal means.  I think it&#x27;d need a pathological FAT file system driver to do it, and you&#x27;d have to build the image ahead of time to do it.",1441868407

This should be done regularly if desired.<p>Also, stuff like &quot;using gendered language is hostile&quot; is absolute rubbish. It is not hostile to have a specific instance of gendered language in technical documentation -- it makes it more personal and identifiable. To be fair, this identification can be randomized between male and female.<p>[EDIT: downvoters, how about <i>my</i> choice to not want to be known as &quot;them&quot; and suchlike?

Best example of such exceptions would be say an earthquake killing your entire development team, that can and has happened and at the same time is not something you plan for.  Partialy why we have insurance.  Though you will find it very hard to impossible to get insurace again software development delays beyond life/death of parties involved, though that will not chance the delay into a non-delay, mearly compensate.<p>With all this Engineers have for many lifetimes gone with the engineering factor or whatever you think it will take, muliply that by 2-3 to counter optimisim.

Wikipedia is one of the best examples of sustenance-by-ongoing-donations, but it&#x27;s an extreme edge case. They rely on their non-profit status and support from companies in the form of free hardware/bandwidth/etc, in addition to donations from end users. There are few examples of large websites successfully sustaining themselves long-term via donations, whereas the web is littered with plenty of dead websites that attempted the same (or transitioned away from relying on donations).<p>Perhaps I should have specified donations as your &quot;primary/sole funding model&quot; as unsustainable.<p>> That depends on the implementation. Reddit did an awesome job of rolling out Reddit Gold, it most definitely did not fragment the community.<p>I would agree Reddit has done a good job with Gold, but wanted to emphasize the contrast between the two. Gold offers tons of great features, whereas 4chan&#x27;s Pass only offers one, because its more in line with the ethos of the site (that everyone shares an equal voice, etc).<p>> I don&#x27;t know moot. Who&#x27;s to say 4chan would&#x27;ve gotten as big if you were more involved in getting money out of it? Seems to me, that considering the userbase of 4chan, another place like 4chan but without the ads would&#x27;ve been the go to place for them. User-experience matters in getting the users -- that&#x27;s why Reddit won, that&#x27;s why Imgur won, etc. etc.<p>I can&#x27;t tell if you misinterpreted my response, or if I&#x27;m misinterpreting yours, but I didn&#x27;t intend to take credit for 4chan&#x27;s success, but think it&#x27;s important to point out (in the context of OP&#x27;s comment) that I&#x27;ve deliberately forgone the opportunity to monetize 4chan to its full potential throughout its existence.

Corrections welcome -- just add them.<p>Three short stories by J.D. Salinger (1919-2010) were to remain unpublished\nuntil 2060, but were released onto the Internet late 27Nov2013 and removed\nearly the next day (Thanksgiving morning in the USA).<p>TWO LIVES<p>J.D. Salinger (1919-2010) enjoyed his personal creativity better if he\npublished less because he felt the presence of a public following -- not to\nmention reviewers and critics -- was a constraint on his freedom. Salinger\nstopped publishing and instructed his estate to release his works piecemeal\nover many decades, as if his life as a famous author would only begin after\nhis life as a private person had ended.<p>Manuscripts to be kept unpublished could be viewed by scholars (any eager person)\nin libraries. The libraries had typescripts of the three stories here, \nannotated in margins by Salinger, but not in final form. Why that kind of release? \nBecause it was society&#x27;s hubbub over artists that Salinger found constraining, \nnot the world of the mind.<p>STORIES IN LIBRARIES\nThe three short stories now released that were available in libraries:<p>--&quot;Ocean Full of Bowling Balls&quot; (typescript; important precursor to &quot;Catcher in in the Rye&quot;)\n--&quot;Paula&quot; (early draft typed by Salinger, his notations in margins)\n--&quot;Birthday Boy (1946; early draft typed by Salinger, his notations in margins)<p>The drafts could be read by scholars under supervision, the first at\nPrinceton, and the other two at the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s Ransom\nCenter. UT/Austin permitted scholars to make photocopies they were pledged\nnot to circulate, as did Princeton until the mid-1980s.<p>The Internet leak did not come from either library, but . . .<p>25 BOOKS IN LONDON<p>The three stories were published as a little paperback in London, 1999, in a\nlimited edition of 25 numbered copies, each of which declared that this\npresumably unauthorized act did not constitute publication of the works. The\norigin of this private publication is unknown. Old photocopies of the library\ntypescripts is a possible source, or perhaps Salinger himself had a publisher review\nthe manuscripts before ceasing all publication a few years later.<p>THREE BOOKS ON EBAY<p>A British bookseller specializing in Salinger sold three of the 25 London\nbooks, the first on 17Nov2012. Prices ranged up to 65.50 pounds sterling plus\nshipping (ca $110).\n<a href=\"http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&ftab=FeedbackAsSeller&userid=seymourstainglass&iid=271278476542&de=off&interval=0&items=200\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&ft...</a><p>The sales attracted no apparent attention from either eBay or the estate of J.D. Salinger.<p>ON THE INTERNET<p>The third book sold on eBay was scanned and pdfs of the page images were \nuploaded to what.cd. Site administrators removed the copy after being contacted by \nlawyers for the estate of J.D. Salinger. However, other sites began to carry copies \n(search Salinger Three Stories download).<p>Scholars say the book is faithful to the manuscripts they saw in libraries.<p>BOUNTY<p>The uploader dtauris will keep the bounty.<p>A what.cd member requested the community at large to provide a copy of some\nSalinger short stories (not exactly these three, but these three became acceptable).\nThat was five years ago, about a year after what.cd was launched. The\nautonomous request system permits other members to show their approval of any\nrequest by donating part of their upload credits, creating a community-funded\nbounty. The bounty for the 84.49MB Three Stories file grew to over 6\nterabytes, the largest in site history.<p>In 2002, Robert Reid (listen.com, Rhapsody) claimed the &quot;active catalog&quot; \nof all 5 major record company labels was 25,000 CDs (Gilder Technology Report 2/2002), \nso a 6TB bounty can download every CD in print 2 1/2 times over with \nV0/VBR encoding (100MB/CD; some are 60MB), and nearly the whole catalog in flac.<p>What now? &quot;Download all of What.CD just in case [we go off the air]. We will\nneed you for a backup,&quot; user Alcahofa advised:\nforums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=185074&postid=5029235#post5029235<p>What.cd has a collage of &quot;1 TB Bounty Fills&quot;; about 20 entries are listed.\nTwenty-six requests for at least 1/2 TB are currently pending (user tpchuckles, 401-500 block).<p>CENSORSHIP AND COMMUNITY<p>Only two items have ever been removed from what.cd: Microsoft&#x27;s COFEE forensic\nsoftware (see SoldierX) and Salinger&#x27;s Three Stories.<p>Letting a member keep a bounty after the desired item has been removed from\nthe community seems unfair to the community. There is a local contradiction\nbetween donating a bounty here, and not getting the item here (&quot;the local\ncontradiction&quot;). But in a larger sense, the global community now has &quot;Three\nStories&quot;. So the uploader gifted our community, and our community -- your\nbounty -- has gifted all of humanity.<p>Solving the &quot;local contradiction&quot; by removing a request before it is filled\nhas problems.<p>1. The removal staff is forced to practice self-censorship.<p>2. The self-censorship must proceed without any data about world reaction.\nHere, there was no apparent reaction to three sales of the forbidden\nmaterial on eBay, but there has been world reaction (search Salinger\nleaked) to the same material on Internet file-sharing sites.\nTo get &quot;the perspective granted by fallout&quot;, one must post the material.<p>3. Removing requests forces staff to take responsibility for\nan autonomous requests program available to users.<p>4. Staff complicity in an act of deception could hide a torrent&#x27;s origins.\nLet staff hold the high-bounty upload in escrow,\nwhile the uploader makes it go public with an upload elsewhere first.\nWhat.cd admins would then release their duplicate (escrowed) copy\nto our community. If you don&#x27;t appear to be first,\nyou don&#x27;t appear to be guilty. Technology, score one;\nlegality and morality, zero. At trial and sentencing,\nyou have handed the moral high ground to opponents.<p>The two removal decisions (DECAFF, Salinger) have been based upon unwanted\ngeneral publicity (10 pages of hits 1 day later to &quot;Salinger leaked online&quot;)\nas well as upon legal pressure. Legal pressure depends on focus as well as\nresources: compared to the RIAA, the Salinger estate could focus on a single\nadversary.<p>The site was taken off line until early Thursday morning (5 to 8 AM EST) in\npart to avoid the steadily building &quot;curiosity&quot; traffic.<p>Site administrators stated their first priority is preservation of the site,\nand thus preservation of the community. what.cd was founded the day that an\nearlier site was forcible shuttered (Wikipedia what.cd). The\nbeginning-of-the-end for the earlier site may have been an e-book posting\n(user Binjo).<p>Members who asked for stronger resistance did not mention financial contributions to\nlegal costs. The existential seriousness of the moment is apparent in the comments of Administrator Irimias (201-300 block).<p>USER ANXIETY<p>Some users (cocabottle) want a commemorative T-shirt. Others are more anxious.\nIf an ebook incident brought anxiety, some some users suggest banning ebooks.\nIf a high-bounty request brought grief, some users suggest self-censorship of\nrequests with high bounties. User sav0y suggests Cafe Del Mar (ambient,\nelectronic, downtempo, future.jazz); others rushed to download anything.\nSuspending interview-based invites might be prudent.<p>Big practical and political differences between us (quiet invites) and The\nPirate Bay (in-your-face politics) were summarized by mediaferret (401-500\nblock).<p>SOLID LEADERSHIP<p>Users praising Administrators conveniently forgot about the threatened return\nof Drone.<p>The [Manchester] Guardian quoted Administrator DixieFlatline:\n&quot;Due to this case&#x27;s rare and unlikely circumstances, due to the\nunnecessary and unwanted attention the Salinger leak has brought, and due\nto our desire to comply with the desires of the Salinger estate or other\ninvolved parties in this matter, the content has been removed … It is not\nto be re-uploaded under any circumstances, and anyone found doing so will\nhave their account disabled.&quot;\nConcluded the Guardian, &quot;Salinger could hardly have put it better.&quot;<p>User Snowflake (301-400 block) noted: The Guardian confirms what we already\nknew, Dixie&#x27;s announcement writing skills are on par with Salinger&#x27;s work.<p>&quot;Strong leaders&quot; for the site and &quot;weak--zero?-- democracy&quot; were linked in\ncomments that did not also mention the vast amount of work done by members to\nproduce the text, files and metadata here, or the fact that most staff are\nunpaid volunteers, or the many opportunities--this thread, for example--for users to\nexpress themselves, make suggestions, and provide the effort to carry them out.<p>LITERARY AGENTS AND ESTATES<p>User AGuyCalledMike reminds us how bad it can get with a grandson of James\nJoyce. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_James_Joyce\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_James_Joyce</a><p>Then there is Andrew Wylie:<p>&quot; If I have to read James Michener, Danielle Steel, Tom Clancy, I’m toast.\nFuck it.

There are some pearls on the internet that even though can be old and maybe posted before(some months or years ago) they can be useful, interesting and even rekindle discussions where new ideas can be introduced. 
At the same time posting something that was discussed one two days ago and attracted attention(as you have pointed- I am not talking about the specific topic but in general) should be maybe linked to be fair with the original uploaders.<p>And I agree that it is good practice at least to check at least the first page of Hacker News or the ""news"" section to avoid obvious duplicates .",1290332980

1926796,comment,1926402,1926402,0,0,soegaard,,,"First of all both Common Lisp and Scheme are excellent languages with impressive implementations to choose between.
Furthermore if you learn one of them, you'll be able to learn the other one in no time.<p>Instead of comparing languages, I'd suggest you pick between implementations. This suggestion might seem odd, but the Scheme standard (R*RS) is very minimal, which imply that all major Scheme implementations contain many, many libraries and language construct not mentioned in the standard.<p>I my self is a Racket user, which of course makes my view biased. Here are some of the reasons Racket is the perfect choice for me:<p><pre><code>   - programs runs on Windows, OS X and Linux 
     with no source changes

   - the installation is pain free

   - the documentation of the language and libraries 
     are in a league of its own 
     (http://docs.racket-lang.org/)
     [that said, the Common Lisp spec is also very good]

   - the language is clean with a very good module system
     that supports macros the right way (IMO)

   - the community is very helpful (ask if there is a
     library/construct/feature you can't find 
     --- odds are you the wrong place)</code></pre>",1290332770

I've been able to glimpse some of the elegance that Lisp users are familiar with. It shares some Lisp DNA (hence the name), but the author's focus on code size and ease of use has moved it away from mainstream Lisp developments. It won't (and doesn't) appeal to everyone, and wouldn't be suitable for all projects, but I've found it a useful tool to have in my toolbox.

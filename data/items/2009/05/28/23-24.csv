The current HTML 5 draft states:<p>""\nIt would be helpful for interoperability if all browsers could support the same codecs. However, there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players: we need a codec that is known to not require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the open source development model, that is of sufficient quality as to be usable, and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies. This is an ongoing issue and this section will be updated once more information is available.\n""<p>Netflix, MLB, NBC (Olympics), etc choose Silverlight to enable high quality video streaming while simultaneously supporting lower end connections without requiring manual quality selection. As far as I know, Flash can't do that and I don't expect the HTML 5 video element to be able to do it cross-browser and platform.<p>Canvas and SVG are nice, but they are hardly enough to kill either of the popular rich internet application browser plugins.

631225,story,,,24,8,lhorie,"Programming Clojure (book by Stuart Halloway) is out of beta (here's a review)",,"I just downloaded the updated e-book last night and from a quick glance, it looks roughly the same as the beta one (with fixed typos and code bugs, I assume). I mentioned in a comment a while ago I'd do a review, so here it is.<p>For those who have never looked at any lisps, I'd recommend reading http://www.moxleystratton.com/article/clojure/for-non-lisp-programmers before jumping into the book, because the intro chapter has a lot of small examples that you can type in the repl as you go along to get a taste of the language. (this also helps get into the mood to drink the koolaid that the chapter throws at you)<p>The book then shifts into a more in-depth explanations of different aspects of the languages. The major chapters are: syntax and basic concepts, java interop, the sequences library, functional programming, concurrency, macros, multimethods, and a last chapter about how to go about some common tasks in clojure.<p>The book provides a pretty nice hands-on experience. As the book progresses, by completing the end-of-chapter exercises, you can gradually write an ant-like build tool. One of the chapters also shows how to write a simple snake game.<p>So far, I only have a couple of critiques:<p>1 - imho, getting comfortable with a lisp editor is a big deterrent for Java people, and the book doesn't explain much in terms of what sorts of weirdness to expect in the transition (granted, the book isn't about emacs or vim).<p>2 - I feel the section about destructuring could be longer and use more real-world code samples, as it seems to be a fairly important concept and, at the same time, fairly novel for the non-lisper.<p>Overall, though, I find it a nice introduction to the language. The e-book has links any time it references any concept (including the table of contents and the index), making it a pretty decent reference book too.<p>Has anyone else bought it? What do you think of it?",1243554144

""Draft"" mode vs. keystroke mode provides a clue, but what if I don't see the message arrive?  What if I have a real-time conversation with somebody, and then five minutes after it ends, one of us posts another message?  We have to add some kind of comment indicating whether it is intended as a continuation of the previous conversation, the beginning of a new real-time conversation, or a one-off message (with the sender perhaps not available to chat at the moment.)<p>Everything that is currently implicit in the mode of communication (email, IM, etc.) and in mode-specific indicators (IM status, etc.) will now have to be communicated explicitly.

Rails has a bunch of shortcuts for common cases (REST as well as :controller/:action/:id). In a way, this is just the explicit vs. implicit thing. Django makes you explicitly state your URLs while Rails will let you state them, but you don't have to should you like the defaults. The Django folk say that it takes very little time to write routes (true) and that one should be thoughtful when making URLs (also true). But sometimes it just feels tedious.

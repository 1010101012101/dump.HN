I don't remember the name), and it wasn't clear how to combine it with a build system like make. I'm sure it <i>can</i> be done, but it was inordinately difficult compared to, say, python, where creating standalone scripts is essentially the very first thing in the tutorial.",1333749595
3809145,comment,3808238,3808992,10,0,Sanddancer,,,"I disagree. His actions lately have driven many, including myself, away from supporting GNU projects and into supporting other free alternatives. Using the GPL 3 on software such as gcc has caused many people, such as Apple, the FreeBSD foundation, and the OpenBSD foundation, to seek alternative sources for GNU software, such as the clang project and the pcc compiler project. His reluctance to use modern technology, such as cell phones, has distanced himself from many who realize the benefits of such actions, and who know that such devices are available prepaid, and with off buttons, for if you want to use them anonymously. His petty name-calling of closed-source products that he doesn't like, such as iClone for the iPhone, has served to turn off many to his message, to the detriment of the FOSS community.<p>I agree with many of his principles, however, his time has come and gone. His view of computing seems stuck to how it existed 25-30 years ago, which is proving increasingly detrimental to recruiting new people to the cause of Free Software. By ignoring why people use closed products, such as his views on why Free Software users would use closed source dictation software ( <a href=""https://lists.csail.mit.edu/pipermail/csail-related/2012-February/007145.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.csail.mit.edu/pipermail/csail-related/2012-Feb...</a> ), he has made Free Software less capable of competing because it doesn't do what people expect software to do. Once he realizes this, and that one can and should look at why people use alternatives to GNU software, then we can possibly move forward. Unfortunately, I don't have much hope that that will happen as long as RMS is at the helm.",1333749588

The former is a macro problem - if you're unhappy there's very little you can do to make a difference, you really need <i>everyone</i> to get behind your cause but because of weird behavioral science quirks this happens very rarely. The latter is a micro problem - learn to have the courage to set boundaries in your life, and the problem will go away.<p>Facebook is a problem of the latter form. It's entirely within your control to limit the information you give them, carefully select privacy settings (which are quite extensive), or not create an account at all. In any case, nothing about it is <i>heinous violation of your freedom and imposition on your private space</i>, since the whole thing is voluntary.<p>To me the problem seems the opposite of the camp problem. There are a few ""weird"" kids who cannot understand how people could possibly like Facebook, so they make it a personal crusade to make it known all the time. Look, our adult society is pretty good at accepting behavioral outliers. Not ideal, but probably the best the world has ever known. But sometimes it's the outlier that's the problem. Consider that many people don't see Facebook as a privacy issue once they've weighed everything carefully and not because they're idiots.

Also, I'm still shocked that the only reason on their FAQ under ""Is wayland replacing the X server?"" is that VT switching is ""horrible.""<p>> I disagree. For example, xpra (<a href=""http://xpra.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xpra.org/</a>) ships images across the wire and works much better for me than X11 forwarding over both local and remote links.<p>xpra is faster for me over remote links, but native X is superior on local links, in speed, simplicity, and also robustness.  X11 forwarding is super-simple and rock-solid; xpra is awkward to set up and is rather flaky.  I fear that since network transparency is not a core, high-priority feature of Wayland, it will end up having a ""second-class"" feel like xpra does.  Just because network transparency is under development right now doesn't mean it will be good.  Their FAQ says it's not a high priority feature, and I've read several mailing list posts from developers that agree with that sentiment.<p>> That looks like trolling.

3809062,comment,3808194,3808823,6,0,rprospero,,,"Just took a look at QuickLisp and that's a big improvement over the last time I looked at Common Lisp.  On the other hand, there's a couple of points to make.<p>1)  While quick lisp does have an amazing array of packages, there's still some simple, yet glaring deficiencies.  For instance, there's no package to talk over a serial port.  If I go to Google, the top link is a stack overflow post with some code on how to do that on Windows.  The next few posts links are either people being told to use the FFI or raw writing to /dev/stty with the unix command line being used to set the tty parameters.<p>Comparatively, the first link Google returns for python is for PySerial, which will handle all the serial port settings on its own.<p>I was originally going to use this as an example of contrasting documentation, since I assumed that both languages would at least have a serial library.<p>2)  If I want to send an e-mail, quicklisp offers cl-smtp and smtp4cl, while python mostly just offers smtplib.  On the other hand, the documentation for smtplib (<a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/smtplib.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/smtplib.html</a>) is readily available, while cl-smtp is limited to the (admittedly clear) README file.<p>---<p>I happen to love the lisp aesthetic (though I'll admit to preferring scheme over CL).  Still, the main thrust of the article is that Lisp is cursed with a disorganized array of unsupported, poorly documented, incomplete solutions.  QuickLisp has only solved the disorganized part of that.  If there's a bug in smtplib, I can feel pretty secure that it will get fixed.  Honestly, I bet I'd have the same luck with cl-smtp, but what about smtp4cl?<p>I don't believe that it's a curse and I do think that it can be solved.  However, this is a cultural problem in the lisp community and ignoring it.  To put it differently, if we'd had this discussion four years ago, someone would have brought up asdf and said that that solved all the problems.  However, we now have QuickLisp because asdf wasn't solving all the problems.  It's great and things are better than they were, but we're not done yet.",1333748443

I'll meet someone once or a few times IRL, share an interest or a mutual friend, and connect with them on Facebook.

Yes, it breaks the traditional model of what a friendship actually means, but your interaction in the system enforces the idea of who really matters to you.

But what's strange is that in any given field only a very short list of institutions actually do it. At most academic institutions it's surprisingly difficult to convince the institution to go after superstars.<p>I think the reason for this aversion is instinctive.  If you're hiring it's much more comfortable to go the conventional route, advertising a position, interviewing a short-list and so on.  This produces a situation where most of the interviewees want the job pretty badly.  This gives the hiring committee a lot of power, which is a comfortable position to be in.<p>Unfortunately, it also produces lower-quality candidates than identifying the best people and going after them directly.  A superstar will be interviewing you more than you are interviewing them.  You'll need to get creative in convincing them that you have something to offer, something they can't find anywhere else.  This is much less comfortable.<p>A useful heuristic: if most of your job offers are being accepted, your standards are way too low.",1333746867

3808970,comment,3808370,3808622,1,0,lizardwhoskis,,,"Most likely. As another poster pointed out, what this shows is that our reason--given time to work--can override more instinctual desires to cheat. Part of rationalizing is considering situations, real and unreal, that may influence the outcome. E.g. I may be being observed and if they think I am cheating they may discard me from the pay group.<p>Without that time you wouldn't consider that ""chosen at random"" may be a lie. So, to the automatic mind your odds of getting paid are the same whether you pick 3 or 6 but the reward for lying is significantly higher.
A simple heuristic the automatic mind may use would be (roll)x(payout):
6 x 10 = 60 vs 3 x 10 = 30<p>I'd be interested if the money incentive might have influence lying in the other direction, however. E.g. I did roll a 6, but if I say the maximum number they may not pay me; if I say a lower number they may be more likely pay me.
This could lead to a new rational heuristic including a chance of being paid:
6 x 10 x 0.10 = 6 vs 3 x 10 x 0.50 = 15",1333746774

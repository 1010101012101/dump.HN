It makes sense if you consider that the mechanisms of each are fundamentally different, and each exploits its own strengths.<p>Planning how long a project takes given data about similar projects could readily be done on a computer (e.g. case-based reasoning or other machine learning). Having seen how bad many people are at planning, there's a good chance a computer could do just as well as an average human.",1356458387

4966529,comment,4965868,4966303,4,0,krenoten,,,"FD: I'm at an OTA/Central Reservation System specializing in boutique hotels.<p>When you book with a respectable OTA, it is basically like purchasing comfort insurance, but you pay nothing for it.  You are being backed by their brand and your problems become theirs to solve.  OTA's sometimes offer perks to people who book through them like free or discounted transportation and comped room upgrades.<p>Also, it is often in the contract between the hotel and the OTA that the hotel will always advertise the lowest rate available through that OTA.  If the hotel works with several OTA's, then the hotel must offer the same room rate to each one that they have this arrangement with.  They sometimes offer the same rate on their own, too.  If you contact the hotel and ask for a room directly, and they offer you a lower rate, there is a chance that they are in breach of contract.<p>So the customer should definitely be getting value from their decision to book through an OTA.<p>For hotels, they usually have contracts with several OTA's.  To let them know which rooms to sell, a hotelier will periodically update the availability and rates using a CRS that distributes the information to several OTA's, simplifying the process.  But there are some really nasty CRS's out there, built in the 70s on mainframes that have not changed much since.  They can be complicated to work with, and discourage smaller properties from putting in the effort.  It sounds like the writer likely had a problem updating availability information through the CRS that expedia uses, leading to them not showing any availability.",1356458252

It seems as though your organization operates quite differently than the bigger OTAs, and from the list of services you provide, I think your market may be quite different than the one I'm referring to (i.e. higher end, less commoditized).<p>However, for run of the  mill franchise hotels, the quality control is already being provided for by franchises (i.e. Marriot, Hilton, Choice, Wyndham, IHG, Accor, etc).  In my experience, third party reservations at these places is only a hindrance because the OTAs don't guarantee room types, so people show up expecting a certain type of room, but the OTA takes whatever is available from the hotel, even if it's not what the guest wants, and then the hotel has to deal with the fallout when the guest arrives.",1356455241

Contrary to the post, they often post discounts unavailable elsewhere, particularly for combos.  For example recently, the regular rate at Wynn Las Vegas was around $200 a night in December but with an Expedia flight it worked out to $140 a night.  This is the discount they usually give their mid level Red Card members, if I recall correctly (upper get RFB).<p>I've also used Expedia to book a stay in Cancun a few years ago; they had a  number of mom and pop hotels listed with rich details, but Ultimately I got a great combo rate at the Ritz Carlton (like $240 - it was about a week before the season really began); this rate was not available on the Ritz website.<p>I have had some bad experiences with Expedia when requesting refunds or changes, though this has improved over the past 2 years with more software features and slightly better call center agents (ymmv).<p>Ultimately I'll book direct with the hotel or airline if I have a specific reason to (schedule, FF points, upgrades, etc), but for easy price comparison and research I tend to rely on Kayak and Expedia almost exclusively.<p>This posting has not changed my mind that they offer a good service - they seem to have issues with their Latin American offices.",1356455125

I manage a seed fund for digital media startups in frontier markets and spend a lot of time in countries like Zimbabwe, Jordan, and Indonesia--and work closely with local subject matter experts. The one thing to be aware of when looking at potential investments in frontier markets is that many of the companies that are getting international press coverage are spending more time on marketing themselves to foreign correspondents than on building a scalable business; often times the technology doesn't really work or traction really isn't there. There is a lot of smoke and mirrors to cut through because there is so much grant money/NGO activity out there; the access to free, dumb money distorts the funding process for legitimate, high-growth startups.  Investing in these markets is very different from the types of deals you read about on TechCrunch.",1356455075

4966386,comment,4965997,4966286,3,0,rcgs,,,"Adobe are the incumbent in this space and, seemingly, will continue to be. There is so much in Photoshop (and other Adobe software) that could be improved from an experience point of view. Simple things like the layers palette need a rethink; there are small inconsistencies with many of the tools; and the software is generally buggy. Often when I get frustrated with the software it's usually over something that one infers is still there due to legacy.<p>There are a lot of more niche tools coming out which do look really promising, but there are a couple of issues:<p>1. Professional software is often quite pricey, and understandably so. Even if a company offers a 30 day trial, that sometimes isn't quite enough to evaluate a piece of software.<p>2. The new tools are rarely compatible with PSDs and other Adobe file formats. I have to sympathise with the software creators here, Adobe file formats are a complete mess, nevertheless it's a required feature for anyone who wants to work with other companies within the industry.<p>It's a shame really, Adobe's monopoly on creative industry type software is holding everyone back, but no one is really in a position to do anything about it.",1356454869

He was considered to have died in the line of duty. You can call that propaganda, or being kind to people who just lost their son.<p>People here in Israel don't care that much about the global number of dead in the IDF per year as a metric of how bad things are here, and you might see how calling something most people see as kindness granted to grieving people 'propaganda', which is a loaded word, is offensive.<p>This is, of course, not to say that I think the IDF is right here - I think they're both totally in the wrong and being idiots here at the same time.",1356454842

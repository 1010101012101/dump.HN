I had kind of suspected that I had bipolar II for a while, but I sort of put the thought out of my head for fear that I was falling into a self-diagnosis trap.

Most of what you lose is opportunity cost, time, bureaucratic overhead, and the possibility that they just take your code and go.<p>Yes, you could sue them.  This is harder than it sounds, especially if they're optimizing to be sued -- companies that are out to screw people often optimize to be sued, roughly speaking.<p>Again, not saying ""OMG!  This must be pure evil!"".  Just, y'know, you sound awfully confident that nothing can go wrong and I don't think that's justified in this case.<p>For starters, be <i>prepared</i> to walk away like that.",1319601535
3157088,comment,3156524,3156923,10,0,notJim,,,"I think you're missing out on a lot of things. The bank definitely has costs that go into supporting its customers: branches and employees to staff them (most banks, not all of course), phone support people, the very computer systems you talk about, and people to keep them running and add new features to them. Most mainstream banks' free checking accounts make these things available to account holders, so I don't know how you can say they don't cost anything.",1319601413

That is something I have not looked into in detail, but potentially anywhere as long I received quality code.<p>But anyway, to your other question directed at me (and no need to think your trying to smackdown because I agree entirely with your sentiment), what do you offer...<p>The things I offer:<p>1. Vision - I know, to some this (like an idea) means very little<p>2. Design - I am competent with UI/UX, as well as designing using photoshop and illustrator.<p>3. Sales/Marketing - I can sell. I'm a good orator and I'm passionate and persuasive (or so I've been told and experienced). In regards to marketing, I've read and learned plenty about it and am always learning more, although I won't claim to be an expert.<p>4. Accounting/Business - I'm an accountant (well, auditor with CPA) so I do bring that to the table as well. Ultimately, along with accounting, I have a good deal of knowledge on finance and general business issues as well.<p>Now, perhaps I'm naive to think the above is enough to offer a potential future tech co-founder. However, it's what I've got and, above all, I am incredibly passionate and hardworking. I know that would matter a lot to me in choosing someone to work with (perhaps more so than raw talent/skills), so I can only hope the same can be said the other way around.<p>Anyway, you also bring up a good point about the problem about the ""tech co-founder"" in that they have far more opportunity (a good one anyway) than I might offer, so why me? It's the reason I have made this post and offer up the decision to code things myself or outsource. I know where I have a weakness, even if I learn to code, I still won't be as proficient as I need to be. So, I will need someone.<p>I guess my hope is that by actually creating something and having customers, that traction (along with the list of things I believe I have to offer) will entice a ""tech co-founder"" to come join up with me.",1319601405

Say I want to watch every Chicago Blackhawks game this season (or any other hockey team).  Well, then I need to sign up for Versus.  In order to get that I need to sign up for a Cable/satellite service.  But I don't want all the channels, I watch what I want on broadcast or rent/stream.  I just want to be able to watch a game when I have the time.  I don't like watching normal shows TV on cable (can't stand commercials), so I rent DVDs or stream it on Netflix. Now there really aren't any options for me to just get sports, without paying way extra for a bunch of crap I don't want.<p>I can sign up for NHL Center Ice (Internet streaming), but then I don't really get to watch every game online, most are subject to blackouts, playoff games are spotty, Stanley Cup games are nonexistent.  And since I don't have cable, I miss local games because it's subject to black out in my team's region.<p>Maybe it's better with other sports, but I really wish there was an easier way to select a team I want to follow or pay to watch games as I watch them, and only pay for that.  The only station that I thought got things right was Telemundo during the world cup, even though I don't know any more spanish than ""no hablo espanol"". I watched all the games there since I didn't want to sign up for cable to get ESPN for two months.<p>Basically I'd just like a way to pay for season passes (and actually get all the games) or get a decent sports channel without paying for a bunch I don't want.<p>Edit: Sorry if this seemed nonsensical, my frustration with finding an easy way to watch certain sports has gone on for a couple years now.",1319600766

The four of you are thinking low Fuck You money, but do you think they're really going to cough up an additional $4m when they can't raise half that?

3156941,comment,3153957,3156603,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"OK - I get your point.  I guess I'm still a bit confused about this:<p>...""it's fairly clear you haven't been as involved with the community over the past few years (or if you have, nothing in your comment gives that impression). Otherwise, you'd know about all the projects that are being launched/have been launched on top of frameworks. Open source projects, community projects using Zend, Symonfy, CI, etc.<p>What in my comment should give that impression?  Maybe I still don't get it.  Yes, there are projects being built on top of frameworks.  (I started zfkit some time ago, although other people have done much more in that area than I have).  I've done project work using various frameworks.<p>I'm <i>not</i> ragging on PHP at all, and don't really know where you got that from.  To the extent I'm seemingly ragging on Symfony, it's only that it's complicated and doesn't speak to everyone's needs.  Many people still really just need a <?=$name;?> type language to suit their small needs, and PHP works great for that (as well as works great for many larger scale projects as well).<p>Honestly, really, I hope you were reacting to someone else and I just got caught up in this as a misdirected target.  I teach PHP for Zend, have certification, just got back from Zendcon, and use PHP for about 70% of my work (using various frameworks).  I enjoy PHP too - again, not sure where you're getting some idea that I don't enjoy it.<p>Oh... yeah, I said that the language can't do some things I can do in Groovy (or Ruby).  Yeah, things I enjoy and like.  You know something, learning other languages has made me a better developer, both in PHP and in those other languages, because I can appreciate idiomatic PHP as much as idiomatic $lang.  PHP's taken some cues from other languages and implemented neat things, some of which make things easier.  I still don't like the syntax of things, and we don't have the same sort of metaprogramming facilities I enjoy in Groovy.  But I'm not complaining - I love them both equally.<p>What does annoy me is that people can't put out a ""negative"" view of PHP without raising the sort of rant you just posted here.  Just because someone points out that PHP is missing something, it's not an automatic assault on everyone who uses PHP, nor is it stating that everyone who uses PHP is somehow an incompetent idiot.  I'm pretty damn impressed with some of the stuff I see from people in the PHP community after all these years.  I do wish some of them would at least acknowledge that other languages/platforms have some cool stuff in them too.  That's happening, but far more slowly than I'd like to see.  Even at Zendcon, there was a bit of an ""us vs them"" mentality I picked up in the hallway comments, and that saddens me.<p>At a CF conference a couple years ago someone brought up PHP and made some joke about people needing training wheels.  WTF - this from a language that didn't allow user defined functions for the first X years?  And somehow you think PHP is a 'toy'?  Every platform/lang has pros and cons, and the factionalization and party politics are really starting to get me down - it's actually part of the reason I don't get in to various frameworks too much (I marginally use ZF as a default unless there's some reason not to).  Even inside PHP, the framework zealots like to bash each other's frameworks (Cake vs ZF vs Symfony, etc) - they all suck and are all great - just use something and get your job done.<p>re: Diaspora - I'd say a year ago, public criticism might have had a chance of changing direction to get something more valuable out of it.  Today, yeah, public criticism is pointless, as it is for more frameworks - you either like it or you don't, and move on.<p>So.. yeah, this was a big rant reply.  You triggered a lot of thoughts, but overall, I think we're in agreement about a lot of things.  People often dismiss PHP as a toy <i>still</i> - but PHP people do it to others as well (listen to PHP people dismiss Perl, Java, etc).",1319598141

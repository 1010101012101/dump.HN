8003719,comment,8000496,8001938,2,0,TimTimTim,,,"As a programmer working in games. I am afraid that what you say about getting into being hard without connections just isn&#x27;t true. It is something I see written about a lot. The truth is that if you are a good programmer, comfortable working in C++ and can work in a team you will have no problem getting a job in games, connections or not. In fact, that is how most people I know in games got into games, myself included.<p>There are problems of exploitation of the workers but this isnt through people scared of getting work, I think everyone with a few years in the games industry knows they have the skills that would help them get another programming job without too much hassle. The problem is that people are passionate and that is being exploited in some places. The trick is find the good games companies and stand your ground on salary and working hours, admittedly this is probably easier in the UK than the US.",1404813572

8003713,comment,8000811,8001143,3,0,sergiosgc,,,"I had pretty much the same experience when learning functional programming. However, I don&#x27;t think it was functional programming per se that caused a jump in my ability to design  software. It was the exposure to a dual perspective.<p>The difference is subtle but important. You need to master imperative programming for the exposure to functional to produce a  evolution. You can probably get the same effect in the reverse path (functional first, imperative next) but it&#x27;s quite uncommon as a learning path.<p>The same reasoning leads me to advise exposure to logic languages (prolog and the like), to compiler design (a complex state machine) and to a complete algebraic abstraction (relational algebra is probably the best candidate). Each will bring into your toolbox an important top level tool, no matter which paradigm you use at any moment in your life.",1404813400

I have read about Bayesian inference in epistemology before, but I need to study it in more detail.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t answer my original question. The problem here being referred to was people disproving the null hypothesis to indirectly validate the alternative hypothesis, right?<p>Is that still Popperianism? Because as far as I understand it, Popper only tells to keep trying to disprove the actual hypothesis/hypotheses.<p>Take the case of string theory, it may not ever be possible to have direct validation of string theory, and it still turns out to be mathematically useful. As long as there is no evidence that string theory is wrong, Popper tells that people can still use it where it is mathematically useful. According to you, I am guessing mathematically useful theories will have a higher prior. Both these are in opposition to logical positivism, where people hold that string theory isn&#x27;t meaningful because it isn&#x27;t validated.<p>Of course, I accept your statement that Popperianism isn&#x27;t the correct solution to the philosophical problem of how to guide scientists towards the truth. As far as I understand it, its just a way of saying that things can still be meaningful if it hasn&#x27;t been validated yet.<p>But people misusing p-value testing as a way of confirming the actual hypothesis without testing the actual hypothesis is just misusing Popper&#x27;s idea as an indirect way to have some validation for their actual hypothesis, and that seemed(seems?) to be closer to logical positivism to me because of how they feel compelled to have some validation to say that their statement is meaningful.",1404811867

Not all tasks can afford JIT burn in.<p>Well, server side Java apps are meant to run for hours, days or months. They certainly have the time for a few seconds of compilation (the JIT is profile-guided, so it knows where it should spend effort optimizing, so the whole process takes no more than a few seconds, amortized over the application&#x27;s first couple of minutes). For long-running server side apps, the JIT is <i>just as negligible as AOT compilation</i> (even if you count the time when the application is running uncompiled/unoptimized, which, for Java, may take 2-120 seconds or so). AOT <i>only improves startup time</i>. But AOT does have an impact on short-lived apps (for which Java currently isn&#x27;t the best choice), and on mobile apps (where you&#x27;d rather not spend battery on compilation). Which is why Oracle is now testing a cached JIT for Java 9.<p>> For me a superior way would be to optimize hard AOT, clear all the low hanging fruits. Have JIT hooks that can change code to adapt to runtime characteristics to mop up whatever further benefits that remain.<p>A cached JIT which would achieve pretty much the same goal.",1404811638

The compiler is free to inline the call if it wishes to, but `inline` means that the same function can be defined in multiple translation units without breaking the one definition rule. Example:<p><pre><code>    // header.hpp\n    inline int f(int x) { return x + 1; }\n\n    // a.cpp\n    #include &quot;header.hpp&quot;\n\n    // b.cpp\n    #include &quot;header.hpp&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIf f was not marked inline, linking a.cpp and b.cpp together would find a conflicting method f, and compilation would fail. `inline` lets the compiler ignore this, and it simply picks one of the multiple definitions as the &#x27;real&#x27; one and moves on with the compilation.",1404811556
8003647,comment,8000811,8000811,1,0,antocv,,,"While I agree that many of the already given examples of books to read are really good books, nice reads.<p>I feel the best way to get into the mindset of good design, or design principals - even if it isnt &quot;examples of good design&quot; as the AOSA book - is to get immersed into an architecture formed from a design based mindset different than what you are used to.<p>Learn something engineered with design principles heavily visible in mind. What is the design principle of a modern GNU/Linux system? Its mosthly philosophical, you wont find the answer in several books, its spread out far and wide and requires that you actually use GNU/Linux for years, to have taken part in its history.<p>I suggest you pick up and learn JSF (Java Server Faces). Start reading JSF books, Java Enterprise things, start coding it, doing it. One good book is JSF in Action from Manning I believe.<p>When you begin reading about or trying to make a hello world site in JSF - youll be like &quot;wtf is this, fuck&quot; - thats right - thats you being exposed to a different design principles based mindset. Its not bad, its in fact very good (JSF and the experience).<p>Only once youve finished say a &quot;community website, friends can befriend each other, send messages, write on wall, share pictures.&quot; in JSF, even though it looks as ugly as can be - then youve advanced more in passing those interviews with regards to design principles - than reading any of the books mentioned so far in this thread. But reading the other books wont dis-help you.<p>EDIT: From experience, the books flaunted around here, Code Complete, AOSA, Design Patterns here there and everywhere, are just bullshit for this task. What your interviewers were asking for is not if you can count and use Design Patterns. Or if you agree or dont agree on which method in a class should be refactored out and what it should be named. Dive deeper out of your comfort zone - go for JSF.",1404811541

It turned out that the ""plaintiff"" was not even aware that the law firm involved was taking the action. They had used them years ago to register some marks and had some sort of perpetual retainer agreement. The lawyer had just run low on clients and was fishing for billable hours. The other company were friends of ours so we settled it most amiably. They were as surprised as we were.<p>The bad new is that sparkfun is still going to lose even if they get to keep sparkfun.com. When I looked into the cost of defense, even in the right... its likely worth more than all of sparkfun the company put together. Their case seems ever weaker than ours.<p>I'd heard stories like this before, and thought them to be exaggerations. Surely the insanity couldn't have reached that level. It <i>must</i> just be sour grapes from those companies who were just a little bit shady. If it happened to us, well, we'd just explain that we had no ill intentions, it was an honest mistake, surely no one would confuse our name with... There are people in this world who have decided that its A-OK to make their living antagonizing the clearly innocent. This for me was the biggest shock.<p>Choose a new name boys, you're patent/trademark activists now, just like me.<p>Edit: Oh! I'm definitely ordering my Sparkfun hoodie while I still can! If they do lose the name, nothing will say <i>""arduino geek""</i> quite like that defunct nameplate. Wearing that badboy to maker-faire will be like wearing a Lion-O tshirt to comic-con.",1256367319

900216,comment,900086,900086,0,0,mbadoiu,,,"I think his view is distorted a bit. Take HBS statistics for example: 40% of graduates found a company at some point. 40%! Top business schools know how to create entrepreneurs and teach people how to take risks.<p>The problem is that the engineering education and the MBA education are totally different to the point of being orthogonal. There are 2 distinct cultures formed by science geeks and MBAs. The entrepreneurial view of the world is taught in business school while the engineering school produces engineers and scientists. The problem with tech entrepreneurship is in education. An engineering student is unlikely to take an entrepreneurship class because that belongs to the MBA crowd. Such a pity.<p>PS I also have an issue with MIT. The students there, especially the ones at PhD, are strongly pushed towards academia rather than creating a business. I went there to school and when I took the ""new enterprises"" class and I was the only student in the class that was not in business school.",1256367243

900188,comment,898738,898947,0,0,dasil003,,,"YES!   You seem to have gotten a lot of disagreement here, but I know <i>exactly</i> what you're talking about.  Someone suggested that this would be bad for scalability, but in fact I was pushed in this direction precisely for scalability purposes.  Consider this:<p>Say you have a page that shows basically the same content for everybody, but has a handful of user-specific elements in there.  In a typical MVC setup you'll a controller as the gatekeeper with overall knowledge of the request, it will assemble the data needed for the request and pass it to the view.  The view may be one template, or it may be comprised of many, including a layout and several sub-templates.  In order to fetch all the content efficiently, you want to know everything up front, so there is no n+1 problem or similar.  This works pretty well for the gross content of the page, but not nearly so well for the minutiae.  Whether a specific piece of data is often not reasonably known until deep inside a nested template.<p>So you have a conundrum, do you make assumptions about or replicate the view logic in your controller in order to efficiently load everything?  Or do you suffer the performance penalties of looking things up in an ad-hoc basis within the templates at the point their needed?<p>The answer is simple, you leverage the client.  The controller loads the gross content and the templates puts placeholder values for all the other data (classes and maybe some custom attributes).  Then you have a javascript library that scrapes up the references to the needed data and requests it directly from the server.  This effectively converts your page into a static page that can be served to everybody, cached to your heart's content, etc, and it offloads a good chunk of your processing to client machines which of course by definition scale in constant time.<p>I've done this in Rails using resources and json, and the performance and scalability benefits are <i>amazing</i>.  You just need to know how to write good Javascript and be aware of the security concerns.  The only thing that's need to make this uber-efficient in Rails is some kind of request bundling so that if you have more than 2 or 3 resource types needed you don't need to send a separate request for each one.<p>To all the doubters, you need to open your mind about this.  I'm guessing most of you just don't like Javascript, to which I simply direct you to Douglas Crockford.",1256365050

If you're going to do that, <i>what is the point</i> of developing the OS?

4636561,comment,4635017,4635963,2,0,w0utert,,,"> And why is it prohibitive for you?<p>For starters, there are no data centers near enough where I live, so the service is not available ;-)<p>But even if it were, there are many reason a service like this has no value for me:<p>- I have 2 consoles, a tablet, a laptop and a desktop, so when I'm at home I already have plenty of options. I can't imagine this will ever change, because I need my computers for work, and the games I like most are very often console exclusives.<p>- I never take my tablet on the road, and I only take my laptop with me if I need it for work, so a cloud gaming service for playing away from home doesn't make much sense for me.<p>- In terms of cost savings, I don't really see the benefit either. To play OnLive games you still have to pay for the game license (in addition to the subscription fee). Since I buy almost all my games second-hand or over a year after their release, I'm not going to save a lot of money on the games themselves. All my consoles have tradionally lasted over 6 years, so the write-off on them is minimal. On a side note: if I was strapped for cash and couldn't afford to buy hardware or games, I wouldn't be subscribing to any subscription gaming service anyway, I would spend however little I had on useful things.<p>- I don't really play games a lot, less than 10 hours a week, and I almost exclusively play a single game at a time until I finish it. This means it takes really long before I finish games, often over 2 or 3 months. This basically means the rental-model for individual games does not work for me.<p>- I like to play classics and 'vintage' titles, e.g. PS2 games or classic XBLA games. OnLive seems to mostly target mainstream, popular and newer games.<p>If I think long enough I can come up with other reasons why a cloud gaming service like OnLive is not for me. Just to be clear: I can see how it would be great for certain players, but I'm highly sceptical about their numbers, and how much they would be prepared to pay for the service.<p>My conclusion is (and has always been) that when it comes to cloud gaming, downsides > benefits, and costs > profits, which makes it a no-go in terms of business case. I have yet to see someone prove me wrong (GaiKai being acquired for big $$$ doesn't count, because it was obviously bought by Sony for other reasons than profitability).",1349880979

4636556,comment,4636328,4636328,7,0,bunderbunder,,,"> Even data warehouses will use Dim and Fact.<p>A practice whose relationship to tibbling is mostly cosmetic. Dim and fact are prefixes that are used to indicate additional semantics about the table's purpose that can't be determined by inspecting the object itself - in this case, whether the table represents a dimension or a fact.<p>Tibbling, on the other hand, doesn't do much more than harm maintainability in the long run.  Consider what happens if, say, you ever need to split a table into two different ones.  You probably don't want to have to go and rewrite all the queries that referenced that old table.  No problem, just create a view that joins the two new tables and give it the same name as the old table.  Now everything that referenced the old table will still work fine.<p>Except if you tibbled the table name.  If you did that, then you still need to go track down and modify every single object that references the table.  That, or you'll be resolved to having a view whose name starts with 'tbl' in your database.  In which case your tibbling scheme has been torpedoed, because the presence of erroneously prefixed objects means you can no longer trust any of the prefixes.",1349880951

What is it that gives Iran and Syria such influential roles in Russian and Chinese foreign policy that they are willing to flaunt NATO so badly? If US and Israeli intel sources both agree that Iran has not even decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, why is the US and Isreal on the brink of war with them?<p>Then I read an article which talks about the New Silk Road that lies in Eurasian oil and natural gas pipelines that the US, Russia, and China have long been fighting over. I had no idea that Iran holds the world's second largest reserves of natural gas, and that China had signed a $120 billion gas exploration and supply deal with Iran -- one which China is seriously banking on as their energy needs are skyrocketing.<p>I'm not familiar with the writer of the article, but the data seems to be pretty convincing.

Almost as a rephrasing of the old adage: ""'Tis a poor carpenter that blames his tools"".<p>There are often factors outside the control of the engineers that dictate certain things that can and cannot be used. Sometimes they are political and sometimes they are more technical. The ability to get things done in spite of externally imposed limitations is something that should be praised. Even something as simple as the choice of platform can be a cause of not using the ideal solution... say there are only X, Y and Z allowed languages - using the cool library for language W is off the table, even though it is highly regarded as the correct and best solution.",1349879315

They've extensively briefed both FCC and FTC plus key members of congress, and have received a tacit blessing to proceed because of a double-blind hardware technology involved to limit the identification of individuals, and the measures taken so far to alert consumers.<p>Not to say that it's good or bad to do this.

As Mark Cuban said: if the CFO said he was able to raise $10B in an IPO and then decided not to in order to protect investors, he should be fired. (That's a rough paraphrase.)<p>>> why would anyone want to be one?<p>Because if you can get in pre-IPO you usually do quite well selling to the suckers at the open. But the suckers don't realize that the key point is ""pre-"". A few might remember the glorious IPOs of the 90s that seemed to rocket up every day, and hope this will happen to every Internet IPO.",1349877714

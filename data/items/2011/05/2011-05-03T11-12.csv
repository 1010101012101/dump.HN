A zillion guys kick ass on a startup after college, only to hang around the community for decades afterwards, looking to write a check, trying to get back in on the action. As rare as profitable startups are, repeat entrepreneurs are even rarer. Maybe you're that one-in-ten-million guy. Probably not.<p>So if it takes 20 years, I wouldn't sweat it. If there's one thing I've learned to believe in, it's that everything in startups takes a lot longer and is a lot harder than you think it is. So even when you imagine this really tough and difficult journey lasting for years, it's probably going to be worse than that.<p>I'm not saying that to encourage you to give up, I just wouldn't spend a second of my time waiting for the calvary to arrive, because they aren't.",1304423937

2509615,comment,2509471,2509583,3,0,robhawkes,,,"Thanks for your input Jonnie, you've highlighted one of the main limitations of text-based sentiment analysis. I've never always asserted that the sentiment derived from this study is not indicitive of ""true"" sentiment of an individual person. Rather, the sentiment derived here is simply saying that people on Twitter are using particular words that connotate happiness or sadness.<p>This is the same limitation that most other studies have found, but it doesn't make the results any less interesting.<p>Another way to look at it is as signal-to-noise. Whatever stereotypes of the UK exists, we don't all talk sarcastically (at least not all the time). Because of this the majority of tweets, which are probably not sarcastic, average out the hard to read tweets. Again, this is something that other studies have found as well.<p>My aim here isn't to fault the method of sentiment analysis. I'll leave that to the guys at Florida University who created it. :)",1304423838

Chances are the normalize will be called frequently and the assert check, in debug mode, will have an impact on performance (this goes for assert checks inside other frequently called functions too). The cumulative effect is a debug build that becomes unusably slow relative to the optimized build without the asserts, which rather defeats the purpose of having it in the first place: if you can't use it to find problems, then what's the point?

You need to decide target bitrates or quality levels to focus on since JPEG (at least with current code) falls apart at the low end and loses out on the high end. You need a specific implementation of ssim (or whatever, perhaps multiple measures) that anyone can run, and agree on the results of. A way to auto-generate pretty pictures summarizing results would be good too, and so on.<p>Basically, it's a project in itself. But perhaps like tuning JPEG, it's too boring for people to get motivated to do it and we'll end up with underutilised next generation tech, replacing older, but equally underutilised tech that could have been tuned to the same level without ditching the associated infrastructure (which seems wasteful), or we'll repeat JPEG-2000 and JPEG-XR and only get limited uptake of the new stuff and just struggle on with the old'n'busted tech as it stands now.<p>On the other hand it seems like this wheel gets re-invented badly every time someone writes a paper comparing codecs or tries to tune their own image codec.

It means a lot to me, for someone who is just getting into startup life with wife and kid to support, giving up a well-paid 'secure' day job.<p>An inspiring poem shared by my friend. Was read out by Winston Churchill at the beginning of Second World War.<p>-----------------------------------------<p>SAY not the struggle naught availeth, 
   The labour and the wounds are vain, 
The enemy faints not, nor faileth, 
   And as things have been they remain.<p>If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars; 
   It may be, in yon smoke conceal'd, 
Your comrades chase e'en now the fliers, 
   And, but for you, possess the field.<p>For while the tired waves, vainly breaking, 
   Seem here no painful inch to gain, 
Far back, through creeks and inlets making, 
   Comes silent, flooding in, the main.<p>And not by eastern windows only, 
   When daylight comes, comes in the light; 
In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly! 
   But westward, look, the land is bright!<p>----------------------------<p>Here is the paraphrase shared by the friend:<p>Dont say that the long struggle [against tyranny and injustice] is of no avail; 
dont say that all your efforts, and all the injuries youve sustained, were in vain. 
Dont say that the enemys just as strong as ever; 
and dont say that nothings changed for the better!<p>If the things you hoped for havent happened, well, maybe the things youre scared of wont happen either. 
Perhaps over there on the battlefield, now obscured by smoke, 
your comrades are chasing the enemy away, 
and all they need to ensure victory is that you go and join them.<p>Look! Those waves dont seem to be making much headway, 
even though the tides supposedly coming in. 
But far behind you, unseen creeks and inlets are swelling with incoming waters: 
the sea really is on the move after all!<p>Look! The eastern window youre sitting at 
isnt the only place affected by sunrise; 
from there, yes, its true, the sun hardly seems to moving up the sky at all 
but cross the room and look through a westward-facing casement: see how the whole landscapes already flooded with light!<p>Clough had just personally witnessed how Garibaldi's brave attempt to help preserve a new Roman Republic had been foiled when the forces of reaction (led, ironically enough, by the French) had successfully brought the Siege of Rome to an end in 1848. He was trying to cheer up fellow-supporters of reform and of independence for Italy. They were all feeling pretty downhearted. That's the historical context.",1304420882

I guess it was because of computational power  10 years ago you had to do more speed/quality trade-offs.<p>Nowdays libjpeg is very very old, but it also means it's proven to be stable and secure. This coupled with opinion that JPEG is good enough may lead to ""don't fix what's not broken"" conclusion.<p>Also, perhaps codec developers want to do something more glorious than making existing simple algorithm way more complicated and orders of magnitude slower for 10% improvement?<p>> those wanting to enhance JPEG for web use need to agree on some benchmarks/metrics to use<p>Codec developers have worked it out - PSNR is weak, SSIM is decent, and only large-scale human tests are definitive, but they're expensive.",1304420490

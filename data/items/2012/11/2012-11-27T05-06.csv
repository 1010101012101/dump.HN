The Windows PC is a declining platform, and the current 32-bit product covers all of the platform currently. There's probably a shortage open source developers working on Windows-specifics. 32-bit is much more memory-efficient. 64-bit breaks compatibility with plugins. Address space shortage will likely be covered by the tab unloading feature mentioned in the article, before it becomes an issue in practice.<p>Overall sounds to me like You Ain't Gonna Need It.",1353995963

4835863,comment,4833218,4835571,1,0,robomartin,,,"Writing your own OS is not the problem here.  My first one was actually bootstrapping Forth on an embedded system.  Let's call that an OS if we are going to stretch things.  It did involve writing a pile of drivers for I/O --parallel, serial, i2c, etc.  It also involved designing and building my own floppy disk controller as well as programming the driver to run it.  Then I had to write my own screen editor to be able to edit code on the little machine itself.<p>Did I know all of that stuff?  Of course not.  Did it compare in complexity to what this article is proposing. Nope.  The OS described in the article is far, far more complex than what I just described.<p>Is is incapable of doing it?  Nope.  I did not say that.  I think I said that anyone who has written a non-trivial RTOS would laugh at the idea of what he described. Why? Because it is a monumental job for one person, particularly if they've almost done zero real development at the embedded level and they also have to work for a living.<p>I got started designing my own microprocessor boards, bootstrapping them and writing assembly, Forth and C programs before when I was about 14 years old.  By the time I got to college I knew low-level programming pretty well.  As the challenge to start diving into writing real RTOS's presented itself I could devote every waking hour to the task.  Someone starting as a web developer --who presumably still needs to keep working-- and wanting to develop such an extensive OS is just, well, let's just say it's hard.",1353995805

4835852,comment,4833218,4833218,12,0,zanny,,,"I love little thought experiments like this, so heres my 2 cents:<p>1.  Targeting a modern architecture is good, but if I were being this ambitious, I would wager having such a backwards compatable burdened architecture like x86_64 (even when it is highly performant just through raw funding dollars) I would still rather start at square 1 on some risc 64 bit virtual 48 bit physical word system.  Go even further, and design such a hardware ecosystem with heterogeneous computing built into the foundations - have arbitrary numbers of ALUs and FPUs and have different pipeline structures allowing for various degrees of SIMD parallelism across some tightly integrated weak cores and more heavily pipelined and bulkier serial cores, and have an intelligent enough instruction set to allow for scheduling (or even better, the hardware itself) to recognize parallel tasks and execute them with varying degrees of parallelism.  Take AMD Fusion or Tegra to the next level and instead of having a discrete gpu and cpu on one die mash them together and share all the resources.<p>2.  I'd kick C out.  If I'm going with a new architecture, I need to write the compiler from scratch anyway.  I might consider LLVM for such a system, just because the intermediary assembly layer is intentionally lossless and allows for backwards language compatability with everything under the sun right now.  But ditch C, take modern language concepts from C++, Python etc, and cut down on the glyphic syntax and try rethinking the distribution of special characters (I think pointer<int> c makes more sense than int (star)c, for example - go even further, and provide 3 levels of verbosity for each concept, like pointer<int32> c, ptr<int32> c, and &:i32 c).  I would definitely want to fix standard type sizes at the least, having things like i32 integers instead of the int type being 16 or 32 bit, etc, with some more modern niceities like the D style real float that uses the architecture restricted maximum FPU register size).<p>3.  Screw UEFI, mainly because it is a design by consortium concept - it is inherently cumbersome because it was a commitee project between industry giants rather than a revolution in booting.  I do like cutting down on legacy interfaces, I'd go even further and try to minimize my system to (in theory) one serial transport and one digital, maybe 4, with unidirectional and bidirectional versions of both, and maybe support for some classic analog busses (like audio, which doesn't make much sense to transport in digital format, although I haven't looked into it much).  Everything plug and play, everything attempting to provide power over a channel so you don't need additional power connectivity if you can avoid it.  For the BIOS, I would replace it with some metric of scan busses for profiles -> incite some kind of device-wise self test -> provide device information in memory to the payload binary, to allow memory mapping and all the other goodness.  Maybe even have the bios itself act as a sub-kernel and provide the mapping itself.  Maybe even fork the kernel, and treat it like some kind of paravirtualized device environment where the bios never overrides itself with the payload but instead stays active as a device interface.  Saves a lot of code redundancy between the two then.  It would of course have an integrated bootloader and the ability to parse storage device trees for some bootable material.  Maybe have file system standards where each partition has a table of pointers to loadable binaries somewhere, or maybe stick them in some partition table entry (obviously not a FS expert here).<p>4.  Screw URIs, go straight for a kernelwise VFS that can reference <i>everything</i>.  I'd love to see /net/<IP address>/ referening the top level of some remote servers public resources.  You could have a universal network protocol where each connection is treated as a virtual mount, and individual files (and everything is a file, of course) can dictate if they use streamed or packet based data off some network transaction about the base protocol.  So instead of having <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com</a>, you could use /net/google.com/ which when opened does DNS resolution in the VFS to      74.125.224.72 (well, ipv6, obviously - we are talking about a <i>new</i> OS here, so 2001:4860:8006::62 - and as a side note, I would <i>never</i> try to get rid of IP as the underlying transport protocol - as insane I might be about redesigning hardware and rethinking stuff people much smarter than myself came up with, I know you will <i>never</i> ursurp IP as <i>the</i> network trasport everyone uses to connect the world ever).  And then when you open google.com/search, you open a remote file that interprets the ""arguements"" of ?q=baconatorextreme on the extension into the returned page file that you access.<p>I agree with getting rid of Unix directories, they are outdated crappy, and all their names make no sense.  However, /bin is meant to be system required binaries to boot, where sbin is root utility binaries, /usr/bin is general purpose executables that might not be local to the machine and might be a remote mount, and /usr/local/bin is the local machines installed binaries.  Of course these polcies are never abided by, and they still have /etc, /usr/games, and a bunch of other folders to make life a hassle.<p>That's enough rates for a HN comment thread though, I'll stop and spare y'all :P",1353995439

4835833,comment,4834372,4835804,2,0,sillysaurus,,,"Gizmo's point is that if only it were easy for developers to simply drop in an old (battle-hardened, field-tested) crypto system into their code, then we'd see much more of that in the wild, and much less md5 / plaintext.<p>Developers use md5 and plaintext because of laziness.  It's not really a conscious choice on their part.  They consciously choose to use MySQL vs Oracle, PHP vs .NET, etc, and they spend much more time thinking about those sorts of choices than about security choices.<p>Maybe some don't realize they're exposing themselves to alarming danger by storing passwords as md5 or plaintext.  But I'd bet money that most simply feel that their current solution is sufficient because it ""doesn't really matter anyway"" since the likelihood of them getting burned by their mistake seems low to to them.  So no matter how much you try to make them see that the chance of disaster is in fact alarmingly high, they'll always <i>feel</i> like the chance is low (until their database gets downloaded, and even then they're more likely to rationalize that away as a freak occurrence).<p>But the root of the problem is the laziness.  So we can improve the situation by making it eas(y|ier) to use Crypto libraries properly.  If it takes very little effort from average developers to use a crypto library properly, then they're much more inclined to listen.  (If it costs them no time, then they're likely to go ahead and use the crypto library instead of a half-baked solution.)<p>By making it easy to fall into a ""pit of success""[1] for crypto, we're only one or two generations of programmers away from making md5 and plaintext password storage extinct.<p>Unfortunately, it may be impossible to make crypto libraries easy to use without also introducing other (more subtle, yet just as dangerous) security problems, due to the context in which the crypto API is being used.  In other words, truly securing an application is Really Hard, which is why tptacek's company (Matasano Security <a href=""http://www.matasano.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com</a>) is so successful.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/falling-into-the-pit-of-success.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/falling-into-the-pi...</a>",1353995030

If we're talking about the dean of a particular college (say, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at a state university), then the answer is: _everything_. Every department with a problem comes to you, expecting it to be solved right now. Everyone always needs more money, and you have to figure out some way that no one's budget explodes (you will be talking to the Provost or Vice-Provost quite frequently). Oh, and you also have to fight all the other colleges over funding as well. And find out how to attract new faculty to your departments. And make sure that no departments are self-destructing, as they do every once in a while. Or perhaps the History Department has decided to phase out an antiquated method of teaching that has got some old fart alumni all riled up about a loss of traditions. Guess who's getting called? You.<p>The idea that an organization of 1,000 faculty and two or three times that in staff [1] would have no greater administrative worry than class scheduling is, frankly, laughable. Would you expect a corporation of that size to get by with no managers?<p>The positions that the original article bemoans (which are also deanships) appear to be higher up the food chain, and are almost certainly the result of severe bureaucratic bloat.

I also didn't imply whether or not the U.S. was making the right decision to go into Afghanistan. My point in mentioning the lack of support of the Afghan people was pretty much the same thing you were saying. I wasn't suggesting that we needed to win them over, I was simply pointing out the fact that success was always impossible unless we had the support of the overwhelming majority. We didn't have the support, because the  Afghan people (rightly) didn't want to engage in civil war, because war is a horrifying experience for anyone. As far as my statement that the war in Afghanistan was ""winnable"", I was speaking on a technical basis, making no claims whatsoever about the morality. I was also speaking on a technical basis when talking about the Drug Cartels. Other than saying the world would be far better off without such people, I made no claims about who should be responsible for making the decision to go to war with them. I acknowledged the drawbacks to it, and as you said, they are indeed obvious.<p>From a technical ""whether or not it's possible"" standpoint, If the majority of the Afghan people wanted to get rid of the Taliban badly enough to start a civil war on their own, the hundred thousand or so members of the Taliban would have found themselves facing an army of millions instead of a hundred thousand foreign soldiers who traveled to Afghanistan and found themselves in a world they didn't understand. The same goes for the situation in Mexico. I wasn't commenting because I think that it's my country's business to act as World Police, I just find it frustrating that somewhere around 200 million people were killed in genocides worldwide during the last century by people who are quite a bit like Hussein, Bin Laden, and the leaders of the Cartel. The world largely responds to situations like this by looking the other way when offered favorable trade agreements, or by stating that we should let other cultures live however they want, when it's never the people getting slaughtered that made the choice.<p>As far as the United States' policy of putting violent dictators in charge of failing nations, I, like most people in the United States, disapprove. I can't do anything to change it, but I accept the fact that it makes us look like douche-bags.<p>One more thing.

The only thing that needs to be approved is changes to your code. Overall though, Newsstand is not very well explained in Apple's documentation, and paid subscriptions are a mess.<p>We publish a standard app at the moment, because Baker did not support Newsstand until a short time ago.

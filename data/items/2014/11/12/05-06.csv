8594218,comment,8592806,8593525,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"Here&#x27;s what could help - turning all users into (exit) relays. That strategy has worked for torrents very well - all downloaders are also seeders (I think it&#x27;s a similar situation).<p>This solves multiple things:<p>1) makes it much harder to do traffic analysis<p>2) makes it almost impossible to &quot;go after relays&quot;. Sure, they&#x27;ll still try to arrest some here and there, just like they try to arrest people who torrent movies, and even with the mass copyright laws they couldn&#x27;t stop piracy. There were just many more who did it, making the hunted down but a tiny percentage.<p>3) <i>should</i> make the legal defense case even stronger than it is now for relays. You can say today that &quot;you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening through your relay&quot;, however you still <i>have to choose</i> to become a relay. I think that says something. It may not be a huge case in the prosecutor&#x27;s favor, but it may convince the judge to be against you in some cases. But if everyone is a relay and you can use the defense that &quot;this is just how Tor/Firefox works&quot;, I think that would work a little better<p>4) should improve speed since relays can&#x27;t be choked anymore<p>5) I&#x27;m not sure about this one, but I think it should make it much harder to DDoS Tor users/hidden services as well?<p>I think having the way Tor works currently is a <i>design flaw</i> in Tor. Tor should be &quot;fully distributed&quot; in a way.<p>As for the argument &quot;but then no one will use Tor if they are forced to be relays!&quot; - I just don&#x27;t buy it. I think there may be some that will get scared in the short term, but then see Tor actually gets <i>more secure</i> this way in the long term, and will return. I also believe Tor will get more new users in the long term this way.<p>EDIT: What I&#x27;m referring to is turning everyone into exit relays/nodes. My arguments remain the same. If it&#x27;s not illegal for people to have an exit node in US (as Tor claims [1]), then it shouldn&#x27;t be illegal for <i>millions</i> to do it either. In fact it could be a sort of <i>stronger</i> civil disobedience thing.<p>Plus, even if <i>it is</i> illegal, so is piracy. That hasn&#x27;t stopped millions from doing it. Just like &quot;being gay&quot;, what&#x27;s legal and what&#x27;s illegal is a matter of how we shape our laws. To <i>change</i> those laws, first you need someone to break them and change the society in a different direction. If you didn&#x27;t have anyone to break a law in a certain direction, then laws would never need to be changed.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html.en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html.en</a>",1415771936

All of my mathematics education has been invaluable in coming up with approximate solutions that are easy to implement and provide good enough answer that can then be refined further. The only reason I can do this is because I spent a bunch of time studying real analysis and wrapping my head around what it really means to approximate one function with another one that is close enough and has enough structure to make certain arguments simpler.<p>Similarly the time I spent learning formal logical systems, differential geometry, category theory, abstract algebra, etc. might not be directly applicable but the thought patterns and problem solving techniques I developed studying those subjects are invaluable in pretty much all my day to day activities as a programmer. Being able to think on a slightly higher plane of abstraction and then lowering a solution on the higher plane to something more concrete is an extremely valuable skill that I don&#x27;t know how you can learn and develop any other way.",1415771697

That is because a node leaving the network could be caused by a failure or a user that kills the program. A node leaving the network is an interesting time, because the node doesn&#x27;t have any incentive to behave well.<p>If a node x wants to join the network, he will first contact a representitive y on the network. y will then search for x inside the DHT, and find the best location. y will then send x that location on the DHT, and x will just join there. You might be wondering how will the links be set up at this point.<p>At the Chord DHT there is an operation called stabilize that is run from time to time. This operation is where every node updates his finger table. It is mentioned in a more detailed fashion in the original article.<p>I didn&#x27;t deal with those stuff in the article I wrote because I will deal with them in the future, talking about DHT security and stability.<p>EDIT: One thing that people forget from time to time is that DHTs have some hidden assumption that allows them to work. A DHT assumes that things don&#x27;t change too fast. At least not too fast that individual nodes can not follow.<p>DHTs can deal with a few nodes joining and leaving, but if lots of nodes become offline in one moment, you might face a problem.<p>Thanks for reading.",1415769172

They become enamored of their own press releases, their own ability to have a &quot;seat at the table,&quot; or better yet to convene everyone around their table to draft a backroom deal--even if the resulting law is better than no law at all.<p>The late Paul Weyrich, founder of the Heritage Foundation and ALEC, talked about this a lot in the context of conservative groups and GOP politicians. Whatever you think of his politics, Weyrich&#x27;s insight was correct.

But a clarification re the last one:<p>The reason I think it&#x27;s potentially a social issue is: In that situation you have a small group of people effectively curating the internet (deciding which sites are useable and which sites are not) for a large portion of the population.<p>More to the point, you&#x27;re potentially giving a private business&#x27; stakeholders the right to decide which media outlets are accessible for certain people, which news sites are useable, etc. Is it possible that this power will be used in a completely benign fashion? Sure, it&#x27;s possible. But I think it&#x27;s also worth considering the possibility that these decisions would end up amounting to censorship of certain views.<p>Your argument about market-choice is a fair one, except that cost is a limiting factor for large portions of the population. We&#x27;re NOT talking about even-handed limitation of supply in accordance with your ability to pay. We&#x27;re NOT talking about cost as the outcome of supply and demand; we&#x27;re talking about choice and access to unfiltered information as the outcome of whether or not you can happen to be rich or poor. If that&#x27;s not a social issue, I don&#x27;t know what is.",1415768438

You could visit a library with books, practice paper, pen, and a water bottle and clock record 12 hours straight minus rest room breaks. You could break for tuition classes after wards. And then again work a few hours in the midnight.<p>This will prep you up for productive work later in life.<p>The competition is pretty fierce for getting through entrance examinations, and I would say working on hard math and physics problems helps develop your problem solving skills as much as programming does.<p>>>I&#x27;ve been to college. It absolutely and utterly pales in comparison to the knowledge base I&#x27;ll never have time to consume for free on the internet.<p>This depends on how your spent your time in college.",1415768411

Are there patterns in crowd behavior? I think so. Others may disagree.<p>Another point... if enough people believe and act on technical analysis signals, the prophecy becomes self fulfilling to an extent.<p>This is not to say a consistent simple mathematical formula involving Bolinger Bands or the like can be developed with any certainty. I think prediction based on patterns is art as much as science and involves a lot of probabilities rather than exacts.",1415768410

There is fierce competition between Intel (Larrabee), Apple/AMD (Grand Central/OpenCL), and NVIDIA (CUDA) to get their respective APIs to be the dominant ones, and no one's yet come up with a mature wrapper API that can target any of them.<p>This is in large part because the hardware itself is still in flux, morphing away from the graphics-specific pipeline of 10 years ago and into a general purpose SIMD architecture. This has meant a change in the kinds of operations allowed on the GPU. For example, branches used to be a big no-no in graphics hardware: the performance hit caused by a branch was disastrous on a massively-multicore system. However, all hardware makers are now adding supporting for branches, because it's almost impossible to port a lot of CPU algorithms without them.<p>In any case, I'm confident that within a year or two, things will have settled down somewhat, at which point there's going to be a mad dash by developers to start using GPUs (probably systems- and library-level developers rather than application-programmers).",1249569123

745461,comment,745404,745404,0,0,mdasen,,,"Maybe it's just me, but I sometimes wonder why web advertising isn't better at supporting services.  Print advertising is really lame.  It just sits there on the page - no way to interact, no way for it to have animation or video, no way for it to be targeted toward the user's preferences.  And yet those dumb ads have done well.  Heck, web ads give the user an instant way to click through and act on the ad!  Is it just that marketing people are slow on the uptake?  Maybe (since there are no metrics) they believe that print ads are more effective than they are.<p>The problem with charging for news is that people on the web aren't going to be single source like they would with newspapers.  It's unlikely that someone is going to say ""I'm content with only one news website"" and get a subscription to that single site.  Rather, they want to pick and choose the articles they like from many sites.  And so subscription pricing doesn't really work because if you charge $5/mo, news might be worth that to me, but I'm not going to pay that multiple times to multiple sites that I want to pick and choose from.<p>And if you decide to charge per article, well, how am I supposed to know if an article is any good before reading it?  And once I've read it, I won't want to pay for it because I already have the information.  That contrasts to a song heard on the radio that I might want to listen to many times.<p>And the web makes it easy for anyone to publish and to a wide audience.  I doubt that you're going to get all your competitors to charge alongside you.<p>I think that the big issue is probably that radio/tv/print ads have been overestimated in their effectiveness or that marketing people don't understand the effectiveness of web ads.  With metrics on how many clicks an ad got, one could simply surmise that only that number of people were affected by the ad.  But those other ads effectively have a click rate of 0 since clicking isn't possible and yet it's assumed that they're effective.  And with that miscalculation, they're only willing to pay small amounts for the ads.",1249567728

I have done a lot of research over the last year or so into what is wrong with social news and what can be done about it.<p>I started out saying to myself ""I wish Reddit had this, or I wish Digg could do this... I wish, I wish, I wish"" until I decided that I would fix it myself. 
""Digg is like so last year""<p>If there are two things I can't live without in my life it's my RSS reader and my social news sites (Reddit primarily, but only because it uses direct links in Google Reader.I used to love the community as well but it seems to have gone down hill lately (IMHO), I rarely ever visit the actual site anymore.)<p>So, like I said I started doing research, reading what other thought about social news and its strengths and weaknesses and I set out to try and fix it as well as implementing a lot of my own unique ideas as well. I'm still working on it it's a constant work in progress I always getting new ideas.<p>Since I'm not a programmer, and i'm pretty good with Photoshop I decided to do a pretty detailed mockup of what I want my site to look like, how I want it to behave and what features I want in hopes that I can find a hacker or someone with some skills that would be willing help me take my ideas further. One of my biggest problems is I don't have someone to chat with to improve on my ideas or to offer their own to make a good idea really kick ass.<p>Anyhow, if anyone is interested in this kinda thing send me an email and maybe we can get these YC guys to give us some loot! :D",1249567474

I feel like the term ""target market"" never caught on in Silicon Valley. Not many companies start out chasing the 14-21 demographic unless you want to lock in a brand preference for later (i.e. Abercrombie). 21-49 is a lot better, affluent is a lot better, enterprise or b2b is a lot better, yet for some reason the competition is at the bottom because that is what founders know. Find the problems elsewhere and you will be much safer.",1249567245

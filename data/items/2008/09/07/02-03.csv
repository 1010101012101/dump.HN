297205,comment,297181,297181,0,0,unalone,,,"Question: does anybody think there's worth to a start-up that's being made primarily to offer a service rather than to make money? As in, something where the main focus is offering a top-notch service, whether it's to a small community or no? Because the start-up I'm working on is one that I have some plans for making money with, but I've done no research as to whether or not such markets are typically profitable and I don't care to. I care more about creating a service that doesn't exist. Is that a bad thing? Or, to be more focused, is there something I still ought to beware?",1220755932

297199,comment,297054,297187,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"I think it's a bad idea to model a personal fitness regimen on competitive athletes.  They are typically over trained.  Really, they're typically damaging their health somewhat.  And again, metric driven discipline is just not the right mentality to bring to exercise for 99% of the population.<p>Also, you should read about high weight dead lifts and spine stress fractures.  You are probably damaging your back.",1220755337

In the same way that Mac power management ""just works"" (and I agree with you enthusiastically there), Debian/Ubuntu packages ""just work."" Also, MacPorts only applies to Unix-style software: most Mac applications do their own installation/uninstallation/updates, which is much more annoying.<p>Another delightful thing about package management on Linux is that it is commonplace to upgrade <i>all</i> the packages installed on your system every 6-12 months, <i>for free</i>, whenever new revisions of your distro are released. Compared to paying $99 for a new version of OSX that isn't integrated with any of your installed packages, it's not nearly as nice.",1220753652

The biceps and the triceps work against each other and unless you can properly relax the countering muscle your intentions will be dampened. Weightlifting generally promotes tension in all muscles, thus a general slowing down.",1220753277

I always took a structured approach (today I'm going to do legs & lower back), but modulated the intensity according to how I was feeling, my energy level, etc. By using that structure, I knew what my plan was and I could avoid overtraining a bodypart.<p>And my notes are useful 10 years later. I can see progression, and the comment ""allergies bad today"" will explain why I cut sets short, etc.<p>That said, I wouldn't use software to do this.

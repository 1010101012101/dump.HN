383989,comment,382911,383949,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I feel bad for you because you've been programmed to be so radically inconsistent. You act like evolution was made up just to weaken the theistic position, but it wasn't. The model of evolution emerged from a host of speciation models that existed, ranging from ""God made it that way 500 years ago"" to complex and absurdly complex secular models involving generative forces.<p>History is full of examples where a model emerged from lots of separate data and turned out to be correct. Another great example is Atoms. For a long time, people thought that an atomic model of matter <i>wasn't science</i> because you couldn't directly observe such tiny things. Turns out that was wrong. Then along comes quantum mechanics, and now we're on even more bizarre and even thinner ice trying to map out effects which <i>observation actually destroys</i>.<p>And yet we're making progress, just like we have in Biology. The ONLY difference that is relevant to our discussion between quantum mechanics and evolutionary theory is that your holy text has something to say about one and not the other.<p>You're deliberately throwing out the evidence because you don't like the conclusion. You're making a special exception for Evolution that no other scientific theory has to make it through just because your religion tells you to.<p><i>As soon as Macro-Evolution is empirically observed, then I will accept it as fact.</i><p>No you won't. When I was younger I had heated debates that ended with, ""As soon as we can see evidence of flagellum evoling I will accept [evolution] as fact."" They didn't, and you won't. You will move the goalpost, draw new false dichotomies, and struggle to preserve your world-view.<p><i>But for now, it's apparent we agree that it's simply a matter of where we're assigning our faith</i><p>Quite the opposite. You have decided to have faith, and I reject that notion. Evolution is a useful model for biology, nothing more. If we can provide a better model with excellent evidence involving invisible winged greyhounds, I think that'd be way more entertaining.<p>You've admitted your position is based in faith, and that's why all the logic, evidence, and reason that I can muster cannot unseat your position. Logic, evidence and reason can only act on rational people, and your faith is–at its core–inherently irrational.",1228276082

383964,comment,383784,383784,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Joomla has been lagging behind the curve for some time now. They have tried to change this with their new 1.5.x releases and I understand that this new branch has done much to address the issues that Joomla has had for a long time, but they already lost me before that.<p>From a hackers POV who is interested in maximum flexibility, and using the most modern tools for the job that also promote standards compliance, I think there are much better options out there, such as Drupal (staying in the LAMP space). Joomla just feels more clunky and legacy to me than other options. I also really disliked past experiences I've had with the Mambo CMS and Joomla is a fork of Mambo. There is also more of an ""industry"" around selling add-on modules and templates for Joomla, where as just about all modules/templates for Drupal are free (as in speech and beer).<p>Joomla would be ""as easy to update as a blog"" if all you are using it for is to run a blog. But to be fair, this is generally true of Drupal and other similar offerings as well.<p>Neither Joomla or any other CMS is a ""SEO miracle, bringing search results up several ranks just [by] being installed"" this is complete bullshit. It comes down entirely to how the template that the site will use has been designed, how the content of the site is organised, marked up and optimised, and all the other normal issues that surround SEO. How well all this comes together of course comes down to whether the people doing the design/development know what they're doing.<p>From a ""business guy"" POV - who assumedly cares little for such things as standards compliance and maximum flexibility (he has a specific function to fill only) - in the end, There would not be a lot of difference between Joomla and another similarly featured CMS, <i>as long as the guys providing the technical skills know their shit</i>. Depending on your priorities, Joomla is not inherantly crap, nor is any other CMS a magic bullet. Just make sure that these guys offering services to your friend are of the afore mentioned type who know their shit.<p>But to me, if someone is recommending Joomla as their primary offering, this does not inspire confidence in me that the people doing the recommending have their ""finger on the pulse"" as it were.",1228274641

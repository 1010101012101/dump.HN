4628710,comment,4628430,4628629,12,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Clean, yes.<p>By any measure, cleaner than what else is out there. Already a fission nuclear power plant will produce less leakage of radioactivity into the environment than many coal plants, fusion drops that level several orders of magnitude more.<p>First off, no fission products, which are typically the most dangerous radioactive waste from fission reactors. Second, the materials used in the reactors don't have the same engineering constraints that fission reactors do and so can be chosen to produce far lower quantities of hazardous radioactive isotopes bred from intense neutron flux bombardment. Also, Tritium is a fuel, and of enormous value so it would be handled very carefully. More so, it would be bred specifically in custom built containment vessels within the reactor.<p>On top of all that you have the fact that a fusion reactor cannot be made to undergo a meltdown or overload the way a fission reactor can. If something bad happens in a fusion reactor the immediate result is usually that fusion stops, which compares very favorably to the what happens in a fission reactor: fission chain reactions continue, temperatures build as the heat from fission products decaying builds up, etc. And you don't have weapon proliferation concerns.<p>Overall what you have with nuclear fusion reactors is no chance of a meltdown, very much less hazardous waste generated (by orders of magnitude) and a very clean energy profile.",1349729933

For example, it's still totally ridiculous that there is not one audio or video format that plays everywhere. You have to dual-encode to two formats. So if you make a game with sound effects, you have to find both a Vorbis and AAC encoder, and if you want to host a video you'll need Theora and H.264 or whatever the deal is there, and so on.  So what will WebPlatform.org recommend, given how obvious it is that one format would be far simpler and make for a better platform? Will it side one way or another?

4628697,comment,4627527,4628583,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually large format data displays are great for calling out unexpected transitions. I had a chance to look at the control panel of a nuclear reactor for an aircraft carrier once, and what I learned was that the panel had annunciator lights that would blink on an 'unexpected' change. So for example steam pressure would by static in one of two states (cold shutdown, operation) and smoothly changing when state changing, so the light would start blinking if either the steam pressure changed when the reactor wasn't changing state, or if it stopped changing in the correct way when the reactor <i>was</i> changing state.<p>Looking across a sea of lights, if you saw one that was blinking you would go over to it, read off the legend (that would tell you the conditions under which that light would blink) and then take action. Once action was in process you pushed the button to 'acknowledge' the anomaly. (which also set new parameters for when it would start blinking again)<p>All in all a very cool system. I've been sorely tempted to hack something similar for our search and crawling clusters. Sadly I don't think its practical to have a mockup of the Enterprise-D warp core which pulses in response to query rate, although that would be very very cool :-).",1349729617

Categories were introduced by Eilenberg and MacLane to formalize certain structures were studying in the context of algebraic topology (homology, cohomology and homotopy are all functors from topological to algebraic categories, and there are lots of examples of natural transformations on these functors).  Algebraic topology is a foundation for quantum/low-dimensional topology, so categories naturally arise in using the tools from algebraic topology.<p>In quantum topology, many of the natural invariants one studies are in some sense TQFTs: Topological Quantum Field Theories.  The modern formulation of TQFTs is due to Atiyah.  In this formulation, a TQFT is a functor from a certain kind of topological category called a cobordism category (in analogy with physics, one can think of the objects as spacetimes and the morphisms as spacetime evolution) to certain algebraic categories (which one can think of as quantum state spaces and evolution operators).  These TQFTs are often not just functors, but n-functors: the categories in question are not just regular categories, but higher categories or infinity categories.",1349729043

Most of the time was spent going through the bajillion endless scroll jquery plugins (99% of all jquery plugins are total crap). It was fun for me, and I was allowed enough time to polish up the code to get it looking like code I normally write. Now if I ever want to implement infinite scroll in any of my personal projects, I know how to do it.<p>The worst code challenge I was given was by a company that basically gave me a huge dump of data (a 60 line string in a very peculiar format) and told me to write a function that took the data, processed it, then outputted that data in another peculiar format. I was given one hour to complete this assignment. It was tedious and in no way fun, so I just didn't do it. I probably could have gotten it, but I don't like doing things like that.

Basically, it would grow linearly with the size of all the sets and the number of intersections found.  Something like O(n * M) in the worst case.  But I don't get why later you say that n is the size of the smallest set.<p>So I don't see how you can beat that.  I guess you could sort the lists, but that take O(n log n) over M lists, and then lookups would take O(log n).<p>To me it will be fastest when the algorithm terminates the quickest - the smallest set contains nothing, the 2nd smallest set contains no intersecting keys, anything like that and will be the longest in the worst case (each set is a proper subset of the next) and progressively worse as the subsequent sets get larger.<p>As for that algorithm running in O(N * M), I am not sure I understood that at first, but I think I do now.  If you hold all other set sizes constant, and can only vary the input of the smallest array or the number of sets and you will notice the running time follow O(N * M), but if you increase the size of the largest set by k, then the algorithm will take k times as long to run (in the worst case), but if the running time function f(N,M) belongs to O(N * M) then k * f(N,M) belongs to O(N * M) as well, so the O notation still represents the running time complexity even if you increase the size of the largest set.<p>So the running time will still increase with the largest set, but the O-notation of the algorithm will still belong to the same representation.",1349727453

Restrict solves this problem with programmer intervention.). I believe that GCC's vectorization code already does this sort of versioning.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>     testl $0xf,%ptr

4628519,comment,4626604,4626604,1,0,walnut-tree,,,"I particularly liked this passage from Wirth's essay:<p><i>A notorious example for a bad idea was the choice of the equal sign to denote assignment. It goes back to Fortran in 1957 and has blindly been copied by armies of language designers. Why is it a bad idea? Because it overthrows a century old tradition to let ""="" denote a comparison for equality, a predicate which is either true or false. But Fortran made it to mean assignment, the enforcing of equality. In this case, the operands are on unequal footing: The left operand (a variable) is to be made equal to the right operand (an expression). x = y does not mean the same thing as y = x. Algol corrected this mistake by the simple solution: Let assignment be denoted by "":="".<p>Perhaps this may appear as nitpicking to programmers who got used to the equal sign meaning assignment. But mixing up assignment and comparison is a truly bad idea, because it requires that another symbol be used for what traditionally was expressed by the equal sign. Comparison for equality became denoted by the two characters ""=="" (first in C). This is a consequence of the ugly kind, and it gave rise to similar bad ideas using ""++"", ""--"", ""&&"" etc.""</i><p>I agree with this, and have never understood why languages perpetuate this practice of using the equal sign to denote something other than its meaning in mathematics.",1349726605

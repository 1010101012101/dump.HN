1810804,comment,1810603,1810792,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I doubt it has much to do with the university drop-out rate. In Austria, it's the norm to drop out of university but my gut feeling is that the UK has more startups per capita.<p>That said, I got my degree in the UK (York, in the top 10 at least at that time) and there was no entrepreneurial angle at all. There was one guy in the careers office who encouraged you to enter business plan competitions and ran one or two seminars (which were vague and focused on coming up with an idea, not practicalities) but you only found out about that if you looked for it. I only ever contemplated opting out of the standard ""get a job"" career path because I stumbled across PG's essays via his ""plan for spam"". Up to that point the ""get a job"" indoctrination was working perfectly. As far as I can tell from friends, it's similar in Austrian universities (except they don't even tend to have careers offices).<p>Honestly, I think the best way Europe could help the startup situation is to somehow convey the message that the worst that can happen if you fail isn't really too bad. Also, everyone seems to be scared of the ""business angle"", so that could be addressed by running a module or two on <i>practical</i> small-business bookkeeping, accounting, tax and incorporation basics in sci/eng degree courses. Because, let's face it, those things are <i>not actually that hard</i>, at least not in the UK. Rest of EU needs to get rid of their idiotic capital requirements for setting up limited companies and severe penalties for bankruptcy. Lower social security/tax rates at low self-employed income levels would be appreciated, too. (those could easily be financed by killing all those stupid grants schemes that are so complex no small company could afford the lawyers required to figure them out)",1287575916

I'm currently at a top UK university, and there is very little incentive to start a startup. Whilst a friend a Stanford has access to an entrepreneur group with a budget of half a million dollars just for having a good idea, we have business plan writing competitions.<p>The very idea of dropping out of universities is met with horror, by other students, staff and relatives. They would rather you just go through uni and get a job at a nice bank or accounting firm somewhere. Starting a startup as a student isn't the norm, there seems to be too much friction.<p>There also appears to be much less of a can-do atmosphere and much more aversion to risk in the UK for current university students. This isn't to say there isn't a good startup scene here - but it's mostly hardware/biotech; most of the other stuff seems started by mid-30s ex Goldman Sachs bankers.<p>Edit - I've just found this article - <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/07/uk_tech_is_anyone_listening.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010...</a> from Rory Cellan-Jones of the BBC which is a good read as well",1287575512

I believe it's a long term trend that isn't going to change any time soon.  Around 3-4% of the population in the SF Bay area are millionaires.

Nobody else wants this. Not the content creators nor the content distributors.<p>Content creators fear it because of the revenue they make from bundling. A cable channel might make a pittance on each cable subscription but they're making it on every cable subscription.<p>Content distributors suspect that unbundling will lead to consumers buying less content, only the content they want to watch. That means less revenue for them.<p>Basically put it out of your mind because it's not going to happen anytime soon.<p>I agree with Mark's assertion that the industry is suspicious of Google's motives and this will hamper the adoption of Google TV. Google wants to commoditize this and many other markets. In many respects this is good for consumers but effectively destroying the viability of a market by giving it away is the kind of thing that has unintended consequences.<p>I suspect Apple are far closer to the mark here: people don't want a computer. They just want to watch TV. At some point I can see more and more TV being on-demand.<p>But there is a schism over pricing that will need to be resolved. Content creators think Apple's rental prices are too low. Empirically, Apple's prices are too high for consumers (eg Amazon pointed out you could buy a TV series for less than you could rent it for from Apple in some cases).<p>I would love to see a revenue breakdown of a TV show as in how much it makes in advertising (excluding product placement) and then compare that to the potential revenue for renting that same show ad-free. I suspect the rental model is far higher but I suspect the television industry is still entrenched in this idea of selling advertising.",1287574271

The article is only a short term view, it doesn't address what China will become in 10, 20, 30 years time.<p>There is of course the one child policy that might negatively affect China's economy in the future.

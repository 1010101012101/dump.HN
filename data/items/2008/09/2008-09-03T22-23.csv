intact medieval towns.  I'm looking for places like 
Toledo, Venice, and Siena that were important towns in 
1200 but backwaters by 1700, and thus weren't overwritten.   
Can anyone suggest more like that?<p>(Even though this is a personal request, I feel ok 
submitting it to news.yc, because visiting ""fossil"" 
towns is one of the best ways I know to understand 
history.)<p>Thanks in advance!",1220481826

there are a lot of rooms to improve from traditional compiler optimization perspective. It does not even have a register allocator.<p>What V8 focuses on is the bottleneck of JavaScript: property lookups. You can read papers about inline caches (small-talk, Java, etc).<p>Some background in GC is helpful too, currently V8 has a generational GC.<p>From I knew, TraceMonkey is quite different, it does speculative optimizations, which is a very interesting subject of VM and compiler development/research. It requires a interpreter/dummy compiler to fallback when speculation goes wrong. In some sense, both does runtime speculation, but inline cache patches the code if it speculates wrong, and trace jit falls back to safe solution.</i>",1220481737

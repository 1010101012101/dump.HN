7679748,comment,7677898,7679549,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Well, I am no priest of REST, but I think you are completely misinterpreting Mr. Fielding&#x27;s point. That whole paragraph that you are quoting there is all about discoverability, at least that&#x27;s how I interpret it. I mean, he even uses the word &quot;bookmark&quot;, a concept which you seem to claim is incompatible with the approach. There is nothing in there that suggests you have to start at the one global canonical URI (which one would that even be? <a href=""http://www.google.com/?"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/?</a>), all it says is that whatever the initial URI is that you start at, the data you get back should be hyperlinked, using URIs, to any other resources that might be related to it, so that you can discover those related resources _without_ _prior_ _knowledge_ of _how_ _to_ _find_ _those_ _related_ _resources_, except through very general knowledge about the media type that the data is formatted as. Really, all that means is that a REST API that exposes a discussion thread and the postings in it, say, should not specify that for a given thread, the postings can be found as <thread-uri>/posting/<number> (because that would be out-of-band), but instead the document describing the thread should contain the URIs of the postings, so that general URI resolution mechanisms can be used to obtain them. In a way, it&#x27;s all precisely about making things &quot;bookmarkable&quot;, by using one common explicit addressing scheme for everything.<p>And that addresses can become dangling is completely besides the point. To solve that, you need a more stable addressing system instead of just not using addresses at all (which you really can&#x27;t, if you think you can, you are confused and probably about to create an even less stable addressing system).",1398952731

After the cold war, some Russians in the know wanted to sell them to US companies, the specs were so incredible (particularly the inner pressure) that the prospective buyers thought there was a translation problem or that it was false.

And while we are going about removing unsightly, brain-straining details from every UI, let&#x27;s remove all street signs, house numbers, highway exit signs, and so on. Also, hide all place names on all maps, Because who needs that complicated excessively detailed noise?<p>Instead at any time we can just call one of the ubiquitous Google-taxis, and ask it to take us to the place we can vaguely describe by some approximate references. When we get there, if it wasn&#x27;t where we wanted to go, well that was our fault for not being more specific. We should try the Google-taxi again. But it might take a while to be sure it wasn&#x27;t where we wanted, since... no visible address!<p>Seriously, this isn&#x27;t just the stupidest browser-change idea ever. It&#x27;s a <i>deliberate</i> move to dumb the net down and shift web functionality towards more total control by Google. You do realize Google censors search results, right? So if searching becomes the only way most people know to refer to/find a site, removing it from search engine results is equivalent to removing it from existence.<p>This isn&#x27;t about &#x27;UI tidyness&#x27; at all, this is about dis-empowerment of users, ensuring that naive web users never become more aware of how it all works, and ultimately about Control.<p>Personally I use full URLs all the time. I keep lists of article URLs in text files (like these: <a href=""http://everist.org/archives/links/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everist.org/archives/links/</a> ) as well as saving articles because they may disappear. I often explore in sites by direct editing URLs. I demand to see full URLs on mouse hover, before clicking links.<p>The &#x27;hide/tidy the URL in the address bar&#x27; foolishness has been getting worse and worse for some time, and is a pain. Chopping the protocol off, graying out paths, shortening... I refuse to use a browser unless I can configure it to stop messing with the URL. No I don&#x27;t want it animated, with bits appearing or disappearing depending on what I do. If you&#x27;re complaining about superfluous visual detail, how is moving and changing the visible URL around all the time not worse than any static URL, no matter how long and machine-like? A static long URL I don&#x27;t care about is fine, but if it _moves_ it demands attention.<p>I can&#x27;t believe the people pushing this actually expect to get away with hiding Universal Resource Locators from web users. Literally, taking down the street signs and expecting people to trust google and other search engines to faithfully perform the task of taking us to places we want to go, without ever trying to _influence_ where we actually end up going.<p>Just like Google isn&#x27;t trying trying to force fundamental and harmful browser functionality changes down our throats. Or coerce us all to joyfully become Google+ users. Or force everyone to use their real names in online forums, Or build Skynet for some reason (ref their ongoing purchases of every AI group they can.)<p>Also, take that &quot;It&#x27;s OK, the URL is still available, it&#x27;s just hidden way down in here&quot; assurance and shove it. Same thing as UEFI secure boot - &quot;It&#x27;s OK, the ability to install some other OS is still there, you just have to thenyzzzt em-thup jksdfh!&quot; How can you be so naive? It&#x27;s a process, a series of planned steps, and after the nth little harmless step, the capability won&#x27;t be there at all. Most people won&#x27;t even remember it ever existed.<p>All you people applauding this move... you&#x27;ve got to be kidding. Useful idiots perhaps? Or part of the choir.<p>If this sounds negative, do you understand how negative I think the idea of hiding URLs sounds? I&#x27;m having great difficulty refraining from using offensive language.

I would refer you to Fielding&#x27;s discussion of the topic[0] where he notes:<p>> A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).<p>> It&#x27;s like saying that there should be an indes in every book (yes!), and therefore you should not ever tell anyone on which page of the book they can find something relevant (wtf?).<p>Interacting with a web service/site is not like interacting with a book (or a physical address), because there is no permanence as there is with physical objects. Have you never tried to go to an old bookmark to find that the content has been moved (and you get a nice 404)?<p>Anyway, I wasn&#x27;t saying that this is all A Good Thing, just that the change in chrome doesn&#x27;t seem at all at odds with REST (however, as many have pointed out, it can be at odds with usability)<p>[0]:<a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a>",1398950761

7679526,comment,7676691,7676691,9,0,byuu,,,"At one point I was attempting to simulate multiple processors running in parallel. It turns out this behavior can get really finely grained.<p>So a processor executes instructions, and an instruction/opcode is made up of several cycles. Say for an &quot;INCrement&quot; instruction, there would be a cycle to fetch the opcode prefix, another to fetch the location to increment, another to read the value at that address, another to increment the value, another to write the value back to that address.<p>There can arise a case where one CPU is writing to memory right as another is reading that same address. And depending on whether you synchronize the two CPUs between opcodes or between cycles, the one reading can end up seeing a different value. This can, in certain cases, break emulated software if not done correctly.<p>It gets even hairier when you factor in that each cycle consists of several clock ticks. There is time required to hold a value on a bus before a read or write is acknowledged.<p>So as I continued to try and increase the precision, I found myself nesting state machines within state machines. Each CPU core had one for the instruction table to select the active instruction. And then each instruction had one for the active cycle. And then each cycle had one for the active clock. And then there was also an interrupt-driven DMA unit that could trigger within cycles that had to be accounted for. It was just too complex to collapse into one giant, 100,000 case state machine inside of a single function. Imagine trying to implement an x86 CPU inside one switch table inside one function.<p>So you would have to traverse through 3-4 state machines to do something as trivial as &quot;increment an integer&quot;, and then return all the way back up the stack frame and switch to the other CPU. The code ended up being around 90% state machine maintenance to 10% actual simulation code. And it was painfully slow.<p>This led me to the idea of having a separate cooperative thread (coroutine+stack frame) for each CPU. Whenever one would read from or write to something the other CPU could see, it would make sure it was &#x27;behind in time&#x27; to the other CPU. Otherwise, it would switch the stack frame and resume where the other thread left off. When that CPU stopped, it would resume right at our first CPU&#x27;s pause. Very highly reciprocal.<p>The end result was a code reduction from around 350KB for a CPU core to around 35KB for the exact same code. And thanks to what I&#x27;ll call &quot;just in time switching&quot;, it was possible to run one CPU through hundreds of instructions when it wasn&#x27;t communicating with the other, greatly reducing host CPU cache thrashing. I ended up with a huge speed bonus to boot.<p>The one problematic area ended up being serialization. Basically, this model moves the state machine into the host CPU&#x27;s stack frames. But you can&#x27;t write that out portably, so it becomes a real problem to capture an exact point in your program, write it out to disk, and then resume at that exact point in a future run. That took a long time to solve, and required some serious trickery involving &quot;checkpoints&quot; for serialization. So it&#x27;s something to keep in mind if you want to use coroutines/cooperative threads and also want to serialize/unserialize things.<p>What was refreshing was that the core logic for switching between two threads is surprisingly simple. For x86, it is simply:<p><pre><code>    thread_switch(to = ecx; from = edx):\n    mov [edx],esp; mov esp,[ecx]; pop eax\n    mov [edx+ 4],ebp; mov [edx+ 8],esi; mov [edx+12],edi; mov [edx+16],ebx\n    mov ebp,[ecx+ 4]; mov esi,[ecx+ 8]; mov edi,[ecx+12]; mov ebx,[ecx+16]\n    jmp eax\n</code></pre>\nBasically: save the old stack pointer and volatile registers, swap to the new stack pointer, restore the volatile registers and return. The function design is the program-equivalent of a palindrome.<p>(push/pop tends to be slower on Athlon chips than indirect memory accesses; and getting the return address into eax instead of relying on ret allows x86 CPUs to start caching the new instructions quicker.)<p>So, like everyone else who has discovered this concept, I of course wrote my own library for it in C89, which can be downloaded here: <a href=""http://byuu.org/programming/libco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://byuu.org/programming/libco/</a><p>Instead of trying like other libraries to build in complicated schedulers and hundreds of functions, mine is just four functions taking zero to two arguments each. No data structures, no #defines. The idea was for the user to write their own scheduling system that works best for their intended use case, instead of trying to be one size fits all.",1398950516

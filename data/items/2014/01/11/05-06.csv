7041766,comment,7040382,7041688,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Honestly, I would rather find out that being Mormon and having 2 kids at age 25 is a problem sooner rather than later.<p>FYI, none of the things you mentioned is (in itself) something that a company can (legally) choose to factor into their hiring decision. Experienced recruiters and/or interviewers will avoid those topics entirely because, while they may be able to ask questions that happen to reveal that information indirectly, they&#x27;re risk-averse, and they&#x27;d rather not open themselves up to a lawsuit.<p>That said, this is one of the reasons I get uncomfortable when people use the term &quot;culture fit&quot; - it&#x27;s not a bad idea in general, but it can oftentimes be a euphemism (perhaps even unconsciously) for inadvertent discrimination. (<i>Why</i> is Joe not a good culture fit? Is it because his hobbies include taking care of his two kids, rather than rock climbing or bar hopping, or something else that the rest of the 20-something office enjoys doing?)<p>> In my last job, the fact that I don&#x27;t drink came up in the interview....they wanted to ask me if I was comfortable with the somewhat alcohol focused culture of the company.<p>I can sympathize with this.<p>I once had an interview where I asked why my interviewer (an early employee) left his previous job to join this company. He said that he felt &quot;a strong culture fit&quot;. When I asked why, he said, &quot;Well, the founder was drinking a 40 while he interviewed me&quot;. I waited for him to finish his explanation, then realized that that was the extent of it. I asked him to tell me more about the culture, and he made more some general statements, but was unable to give any other concrete examples.<p>The <i>only</i> thing that an early employee at that company could say to sell me on the company was that the founder drinks during job interviews. I&#x27;m glad I dodged that bullet early.",1389419937

He has no technical skills but he has marketing skills and he has resources, both financial and potential customer wise. Project itself can be built in a few months with a ballpark of $30-40k.This is not the first time I have been approached by people with startup ideas. Actually, I have relatively good experience at finding teams overseas and managing / building technology with them as I am a developer as well. I delivered a few projects before with this approach. However, I have always quoted the cost of project to those who wanted to get it built and didn&#x27;t pursue an ownership. I am considering taking a different route this time and considering  doing a counter offer and ask stake in the company for part of my services instead. This is the part where I am clueless. Is there some written or accepted formula for technical people like me, so we can at least calculate the percentage we should ask in these type of situations. There&#x27;s definitely some hard cost for outsourcing parts of the project and things like servers etc as you can imagine. I will clearly won&#x27;t pay any of it. ideally I would like to get paid to be able to feed my self and have some cushion too should things go sour and it fails. How should oneself approach to these kinds of situations? I would really appreciate any feedback.",1389419718

7041760,comment,7040332,7041640,1,0,notastartup,,,"Thanks for clearing that up. I&#x27;m quite surprised to see how large the salary cost is. That and the 400k for consultants ( was this for computer vision experts?)<p>I&#x27;m kind of impressed looking at the landing video, it&#x27;s a neat idea, it&#x27;s sophisticated using CV to organize photos. However, the market just didn&#x27;t respond enough to cover the payroll costs.<p>Did having a VC funding in anyway impact your decision making to grow faster than you should?<p>I guess it starts with an idea, does it fit? if you have VC money you can see the answer faster but I fear that it puts an expiry date on your product if the answer is still no by the time you can&#x27;t find another investor. Shame because investors are not always rational. Maybe the next investor could&#x27;ve seen the vision behind your product and pushed.  Sad to see a seemingly great product disappear from the market and reducing consumer choice because they had to &#x27;go big or go home&#x27;.<p>I also wonder what it would&#x27;ve been like if you started in a market where tech salary was on the low side, such as Vancouver, BC, where there are laws set in place so that you can work your developers and designers to death out of fear of losing their job in the scarce market and not having to pay any bonuses or overtime.<p>I wonder what the outcome would&#x27;ve been if you weren&#x27;t funded, and grew customer by customer. Doing this would&#x27;ve fine tuned the margin between cost and profit and forcing you to grow at a rate that is right for your size at the right price at the right time (where supply and demand curves intersect) just like mom and pop&#x27;s business.<p>Thanks for sharing this boatload of information on how a company works for those that never ventured out to startupdom.

In that moment, the task at hand looms large in their attention, so they are disproportionately tempted to submit to it and keep working. The benefits of taking the break are somewhere out in the future, they&#x27;re abstract, and even if you intellectually believe in the benefits, it can be easy to discount them, right there, in that moment. The task at hand is right there, right then, very concrete, no discount.<p>For such people, all-or-nothing is a way for them to make a decision ahead of time, in a moment of less stress and greater foresight, and perhaps commit themselves to it in a way that takes the decision out of their hands in their weaker moments.

What I found is the Amazon hosting team is excellent: they moved mountains for my account to get us to success.<p>The Amazon account exec arranged immediate discounts and bridge services, even working through the holidays, then brought in multiple engineers for phone calls with me to teach me how to optimize our project to cost less to run. Every one of the Amazon people who helped me was 100% on board with finding ways to make the project successful.<p>That conversation is <i>always</i> worth having with vendors in my experience. They may be able to come up with ideas, or offer rebates, or promotions, or even convertible note financing toward the next fundraising round.",1389416609

That did save quite a bit of money when we did the switch and it was easier to do than we expected, so strongly recommended!",1389416528

I don&#x27;t have a solid answer, but slander and libel claims could form a civil case, while intimidation, physical threats and using social media to extort could be criminal.

7041651,comment,7040404,7040453,2,0,dekhn,,,"Sure.  In general, if you have a time-domain signal (like a music file) you can break it up into little pieces and compute the frequencies in the pieces.  For example, you could take a small part of a song, and say &quot;this part of the song is a 400hz sound for 0.3 seconds&quot;.  This is typically done with an algorith called the fourier transform, which is used to convert between time-domain and frequency-domain signals.    However, as you make smaller and smaller time fragments, you pay a cost- less accuracy in the estimate of the frequency (because you have fewer samples to work with).\n In general, this relationship could be expressed as &quot;accuracy of frequency * accuracy of time = a constant&quot;.<p>Presumably, what they found is that human&#x27;s auditory system is not doing simple operation like that but has the ability to pick out frequencies in short time segments (IE, while listening in real time) with better resolution that a short-time fourier transform.  IE, somebody could estimate the frequency of a pitch faster than what you&#x27;d expect by the equation I gave above.<p>None of this violates the laws of physics; the ear and brain would just need to do a different type of analysis.  Probably more like wavelets.",1389416438

Nominally the %03d.jpg is supposed to be a printf-style template, but I had trouble with anything but straight numbers like that (possibly my camera&#x27;s naming convention confused it). I used emacs&#x27; wdired mode to bulk rename the files. &quot;-start_number $X&quot; is helpful so you can just grab photos off the camera&#x27;s photo list without having to renumber them. &quot;-s 1920x1080&quot; tones down the resolution since the vast bulk of cameras take way-more-than-HD resolution, and I didn&#x27;t bother with trying to fiddle with setting it down in the camera, because 32GB SD mini cards are cheap now.<p>I&#x27;ll say this to anyone thinking of trying it out: Once I had a little stubby tripod I could put on the kitchen table, it was really quite a fantastically easy project. Stop-motion is, of course, an <i>incredibly</i> labor intensive style of animation... for <i>professional</i> results. For 3 fps, grabbing some children&#x27;s toys that were probably just on the floor, and moving just one or two things per frame, you can be taking a shot every 10 seconds or so, quite easily. My kids were 7 & 4 and, quite frankly, probably both below average on their patience (for various reasons), and we actually made 4 videos today. It&#x27;s had a much better bang/buck for the kids than I expected.<p>And it&#x27;s yet another place where Legos <i>really</i> shine, by the way.",1432429809

They claim all sorts of maladies, but aren&#x27;t ever able to cite anything. They also ignore how not only the FDA, but every other food safety body, as far as Singapore, have also approved it. I cut out all aspartame and sucralose for a few months, and those people were shocked that I noticed no difference - so sure they were of evil chemicals hurting my, I dunno, being. I actually carry sucralose around in SF, as some restaurants won&#x27;t have any zero glycemic index sweeteners.<p>Sorta like MSG.

(Yes, it was <i>that</i> long ago) Sometime later we wanted to expand and cover all the trans* options which resulted in that piece of code expanding into a horrible mess of weird cases, and those users not being happy with the result anyway.

Users would be able to hide their gender if they wanted, and if they wanted to use something like ""he or she/him or her/his or her"" or ""ey/ey/eir"", they would be able to just fill it in, and the system would use it in its automatically generated notifications and stuff (Alex posted a comment on eir webzone).  This would give us an easy way to gain exposure and experience to the various attempts at creating gender-neutral singular third-person pronouns, and maybe figure out which ones are good (or whether it's worth bothering about).<p>Also, it might allow for funsies like this.<p><pre><code>  Possessive: His Majesty's\n  Subjective: His [random from: Awesomeness, Sleepiness, Whimsy]</code></pre>",1310116529

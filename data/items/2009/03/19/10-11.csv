It's also going to need an ecosystem and the people it needs in that ecosystem use OSX and Linux. Making it inflexible or ""hiding"" it are the exact wrong things to do.<p>Firefox Greasemonkey scripts are used by power users to make minor tweaks to specific sites. I don't see how that functionality will further Google's lofty plans for Chrome. This was a quick hack that nominatively fulfilled a very popular feature request.",1237460298

I'm not so sure if it will be possible in chrome...",1237460169

523126,comment,522816,523095,0,0,Andys,,,"Thanks for the data point.  In theory Intel SSDs should fail about as often as a motherboard or stick of RAM, excluding the graceful failure you talk about.<p>The graceful failing is where there are no free sectors left for wear levelling or bad block remapping.  When it fails this way you should still be able to read your data off it.<p>EDIT: I've just received an anecdotal comment from a friend who works at Intel that high temperatures affect MLC flash life rapidly in an negative way.  I can't find any data to back this up.",1237459596

523124,comment,522728,522728,0,0,bk,,,"Rather than thinking of these steps as a strict sequence, one should think of them as parallel processes with shifting resource allocations.<p>Ultimately, the development process comes down to the experience and habits of the developer. If you have a lot of experience, your marginal cost of ""getting it right"" from the beginning is lower, because you already have the necessary domain expertise.<p>For example, if you're inexperienced, you might build a login system that simply stores plain text with a note to ""hash passwords"" later. You might then move through unsalted via manually salted hashing to finally arrive at something like bcrypt.",1237459472

But you and I have no idea about these particular contracts, do we?<p>But that's really academic, because the AIG employees did not commit fraud.<p>And we're talking about investment bankers. Their <i>job</i> is to take calculated risks. These are very finely calculated. In the case of AIG, the problem isn't that their gambles went south. The problem is that somebody changed the rules on them, so the <i>paper</i> value of the investments (said values not having been realized yet) was changed, changing the calculations going into AIG's credit rating and thus making lenders wary.<p>As was noted elsewhere in this thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=522777"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=522777</a> ), these executives weren't committing fraud, nor were they even losing actual money.",1237459213

If an analog signal is not the clearest, you just see or hear a slight interference, but you can still follow the program continuously. I watch the digital broadcast now, and it is common for it to drop out when I move around the room. The digital mandate was a ploy for the cable providers to grab more market share.<p>But I'll be glad when the freed up bandwidth can be used for internet.",1230554871

And aren't most networks happy with more channels and more chances to grab ad-revenue? Surely that would spurn the adoption of HD more than a particular competitor being first of the boat.<p>But I have heard of Good Night, and Good Luck, and perhaps the other film, if you mean the Enron documentary (The Smartest Guys in the Room).

Cuban was on the HD bandwagon when it was empty. Haha he certainly didn't invent the Mavericks, but he completely transformed them & more importantly, made them a contender - much to the admiration of hundreds of thousands of Dallas Mavericks fans.<p>MicroSolutions was bought by CompuServe who you may or may not be familiar with. Have you heard the movies titled: <i>The Smartest Guys in The Room</i> or <i>Good Night, and Good Luck</i>? He was behind them.<p>I certainly get what you're saying, it's just that sometimes Cuban is wrongly portrayed as a one-trick pony.  Also of note, I had never heard of lastminute.com until today. And even if i had, I doubt I'd know the person behind it.",1230553862

Only their backward, so-called ""democracy"" and a handful of nations in east Asia take it very seriously anymore, while the concept is used to pit regions against one another in Africa (see the US interference in Ethiopia and Somalia for a good case study).

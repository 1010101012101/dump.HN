It was caused by hubris over stock prices.  The reason why so many people lost their shirts in the first bubble was because millions of Joe Averages took out cash advances or cashed out home equity to buy Internet stocks.  There was a lot of hubris around the NASDAQ and average investors jumped in on the action en masse.  I personally knew at least 4-5 people who had left their jobs to become day-traders.  <p>I worked with a Med student who had maxed out 8-10 credit cards, bought high tech stocks with them, and then bought a collection of motorcycles with his stock earnings.  When the bubble popped, he was left with a bunch of loans on expensive motorcycles, $100,000 in credit card debt and a great position on worthless Pets.com stock.  <p>Sarb-Ox has really clamped down on the number of IPO's that are occuring now.  So, even though there might be hubris around web apps right now, the average investor has no way of pumping money into those businesses, and that's a good thing.  <p>What start-ups are creating are several products in tandem:  The first is software that actually does stuff.  The second is a community of users that develop and grow around that software product.  The third is a small tight-knit group of people who have proven their capacity to produce.  <p>Big Co is interested in all three of those things.  And Big Co has proven repeatedly that they are willing to shell out a bunch of cash to aquire the software, the community or the people.  Even if the startup isn't profitable, the software, community and people are still very valuable to companies that need those things.  <p>What start-ups aren't creating this time around is IPO fever where the stock price gets ramped up while the founders and employees cash out.  This is what's going to prevent the next big bubble from forming around web apps for quite a while this time around.  The fundamentals are much better this time around.<p>",1191850524

My interpretation is that this is a sort of a ""club"" where anyone is welcome to contribute ideas and work on their own or in ad hoc collaborations to increase the value to the world and as a by product report their earnings so that Andrew Yates can add them to his total as being the trigger for this whole thing.\nThis is like the butterfly effect in chaos theory or a leadership training in the real world.\nThis month will be fun for the participants and is achievable.<p>I won't be able to come to the face to face meeting (I'm in Israel) but will participate if there is a website. waiting for byiq.com",1191849022

I'm currently self-learning Discrete Maths with OCW, Khan Academy, and books from the library.<p>I learn in my free time and it's been amazing. For support, I often use OpenStudy.com's amazing community, especially for math and computer science things. I'm planning on ramping up my experience and practice by starting to participate in open source projects (the folks at #openhatch on freenode and openhatch.org have been amazing here), as well as getting a portfolio of projects on github.<p>I've run into sort of a conundrum that I knew I'd have to face sooner or later -- how exactly do I receive recognition and get credit for what I've been learning for the last couple of years? I could always put it under education and experience on my resume, but are there pointers that people on HN can give on how exactly I can prove I know and learned the things I say I have?<p>I really appreciate that we live in a time where anyone can get a world-class education for free (almost all in the local public library and free time at home/after work) from some of the best institutions in the world like this.

In functionality, Hubski is part news-aggregator, part blogging-platform and part social-feed.<p>Up front, Hubski looks and works most like a news aggregator, like HN. Hubski enables you to tag each post with a hashtag, and to follow tags and other users. Doing so builds your own personalized hubfeed composed of the kind of content you like.<p>To make sharing less dependent on the frontpage and voting, users can hub a post they like, which sends it to the hubfeeds of their followers. This works like retweeting in Twitter, as posts can spread between people that want to share content.<p>Furthermore, to foster the submission of content rich posts, text can be posted with links, links are active in the text, and urls of images and videos are embedded. Your submissions to Hubski constitute your hub, which is similar in format to a blog. I now use my hub as a blog actually: http://hubski.com/hub?id=mk<p>The Karma system for Hubski is currency-based. Karma is spent on votes and converted into Clout which cannot be spent. A small amount of Karma is granted each day that you interact on the site. The more Clout and Followers you have, the more Karma that is granted to you. A 5-point (+ to +++++) grading system allows users to see the general value of a post or comment, but only owners of posts can see the actual score.<p>Hubski has been up for a couple of months, and we have a small but energetic group which is having a good time of it.<p>Although Hubski is just getting underway, current use has given me some direction for future development. I am working on the inter-user connections at the moment. Its my goal to increase the ability to share and find good conversation with people you appreciate, while making it easy to keep noise to a minimum. My pal calls Hubski The thinking-mans Twitter. -IMHO, thats the highest compliment its been paid.<p>Please have a look for yourself. And feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!<p>BTW, I have been programming for about 6 months now. I decided I wanted to build my own apps, and started with Hubski. Yes, its built in Arc on top of the HN source code. I submitted it to HN about 6 weeks ago, but it really wasnt ready for prime time, and I have done quite a bit of work on it since then.<p>http://hubski.com",1304697300

2521280,comment,2513094,2514897,1,0,bradleyland,,,"Are people really concerned about this? The entire notion of pirates taking off with a nuclear barge is absurd.<p>First, moving a 472 ft barge through the water is not something that occurs quickly. Even if pirates were able to gain control of such a reactor, a military response would be so swift and overpowering that they'd be lucky to make it a few miles (at an optimistic 12 knots) before intercept and certain doom.<p>Next, you can bet that these nuclear barges would be some of the most watched maritime objects in the world. We wouldn't need to worry about the Russian's watching and securing them, because US spy satellites and a desk of 5 ""analysts"" will be providing briefs on the status of these reactors to national security advisors daily.<p>Finally, every first-rate military in the world has dedicated billions of dollars to the problem of naval attack weapons. A pirate effort has about zero chance of making it within several hundred miles of shore. A nation whose borders are facing a nuclear threat wouldn't even need to waste an anti-ship missile. A Super Hornet cruises at around 600 MPH. Even just a strafing run with 20mm cannon fire would obliterate any pirate tow vessel.<p>The notion of a nuclear barge as a high-value terrorist target is absolutely absurd.",1304697035

2521270,comment,2516615,2516615,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"All right, I'll finally comment on Agile (personal perspective, not newsworthy of itself).<p>A few years ago, one of the ""big name"" proponents of Agile and whatnot came to the area, and I let a few people know and we went to listen. [1]<p>It was nothing more than a buzzword laden rehash:  Part common sense, part a rephrasing of the same old corporate mumbo jumbo we'd all long since learned to ignore where we can, and tolerate where we must.<p>On top of it, he was an arrogant prick -- at least, that day.  The people I was with were generally quite intelligent and rather conscientious.  Some tried to ask questions, especially to get past the buzzwords to the gist of the topic.  His responses basically ran along the lines:  ""You're doing it wrong.""  This as a preface -- as an assumption, not even acknowledging the details the person described.  Then, more 'blah blah buzzwords' lead to ""blah blah metrics'.<p>It felt like a verbalized extension of PowerPoint (IIRC, he had PowerPoint along for the ride, too).<p>After that, I stopped paying much attention to articles on ""agile"".  There's some good value in some of the details, but trust your common sense, and that you've probably already figured out most of the basics for yourself.<p>Also, I'll add that different people have different working styles.  Exhibit some trust that they have figured out, at least to some extent, what works for them.  Then stop trying to pound them into that proverbial ""round hole"".<p>Yes, people have to communicate effectively.  But this does not equate with e.g. shoving them all into a ""bullpen"".  Or making them think all day with someone staring over their shoulder, or vise versa.<p>As for e.g. continuous builds/integration and all the other technical aspects.  Some good portion of that is an outgrown of continued developments in various systems.  I suppose ""agile"" publicizes these, but you should be aware of and considering them, regardless.<p>[1]  I guess I should add that he worked for IBM, IIRC.  So, of course, they were there to promote ""agile"" in a manner that would sell IBM products and services.<p>My experience may therefore relate more to how agile translates to the world of larger corporations.  By the time its transmogrified by all those filters, it sounds a lot like more of the ""same old same old"".<p>YMMV",1304696780

This gives you a noise profile on what should be a completely black screen equal to the noise generated during the real photo. The camera then automatically removes the noise from the first photo using the second. Of course, this means you have to wait for the camera to take and process the second shot, which could be up to several seconds long.

He already built one of his own, wrote own drivers and he currently uses it as his primary one for recording singers (he studies vocal tract). I would like to push him, to make it all open source - beginning with the code and ending with the schematics of building of your own. I am just a beginner C coder, but I hope there is a lot of people which could be possibly interested in such thing. My question is - how to attract developers / engineers for such non-profit project? I mean, it can obviously become huge when it will be made right, especially amongst professional musicians (such as myself) wich require more than regular built-in stuff. So let me know if anything comes to your mind or you already want to participate maybe :)). Thanks, Jonas",1304694972

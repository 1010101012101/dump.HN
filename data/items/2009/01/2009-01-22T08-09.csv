Imagine how many people (now including me) have spent time investigating the simple fact that one person landed in Memphis and wasn't impressed.  Who cares!!! Its not a PR problem.  Its just one guy from Atlanta saying what he really thinks.  Or is FedEx sending the message that they don't want to hear what people really think?<p>Look at this part:
""FedEx Corporation pays Ketchum annually for the valuable and important work your company does for us around the globe. We are confident however, it is enough to expect a greater level of respect and awareness from someone in your position as a vice president at a major global player in your industry"".<p>In other words, a PR firm is only supposed to spread sunshine, and money equals respect.

  President can ignore a former President's wishes.
</code></pre>
Actually, it's a bit more dramatic than that. Section 4(b) says ""the Archivist shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent President or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order.""<p>Under this executive order, the Archivst acts under the instruction of the current President. That same section gives the former President 30 days notice before his records get released. If the former President wants to assert executive privilege (and the current President disagrees) the former President has to get a court to help him out. This will make it fairly expensive to assert executive privilege, but it also provides judicial oversight over claims of executive privilege by former Presidents.<p>Checks and balances, baby!",1232611969

We were told that it was called this because it used to be that all FedEx packages, no matter where they were going, were sent through Memphis.  Googling for ""Memphis distance"" didn't seem to turn up anyone else using the term the same way though, so I'm beginning to wonder if I imagined it...  I don't suppose anyone else has ever heard of it?",1232611796

At least, not entirely.<p>Every team needs a few ""Rock Star"" programmers (to use the author’s terminology).  When hiring those folks I think his advice is spot on.  But the reality of programming a project is that there will be some tedious work that the ""Rock Stars"" will find boring.  In my experience those types of developers actually do pretty mediocre work when forced to write no-brainer code.<p>So I’ve found the best mix is to have a few of these rock star developers mixed in with folks who enjoy development and are hard workers but who are at a point in their life where they don’t have time for side projects.  These are the guys who were probably rock stars in their younger years but now have spouses, kids and all the trappings of that (soccer practice, dance recitals, et al).  Since they aren’t looking to work for the majority of their fulfillment they tend to be ok with the tedious stuff and since they are still decent developers they turn in solid code.",1232611640

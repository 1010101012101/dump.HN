It’s also partly because we sometimes don’t even specify what behaviour we want in advance, because we forgot to consider a certain case or didn’t anticipate a certain interaction.<p>What you’re talking about would require advancing beyond programming with precise technical instructions and into creating systems that can handle complicated but unanticipated situations in the way the humans running the system would choose themselves or at least consider an acceptable or desirable alternative. But how will such a system “study” and “understand” what is required of it in an unanticipated situation?<p>I’m not saying no-one will ever have better ideas than we have today for dealing with these issues, but I suspect we’re a very long way from achieving the kind of general purpose AIs you’re talking about. I can believe that within some of our lifetimes we will see systems that make educated guesses but are on balance more reliable than humans in certain specific cases, perhaps if the people working on self-driving cars continue to make good progress. On the other hand, that’s also a great example of something where some very smart people have been working for several years and with vast resources to handle a single situation that we teach kids to deal with after a few days of training, yet they’re still a long way from the kind of futuristic AI we’re talking about, which perhaps gives a sense of how hard this kind of problem really is.",1444588811

Although I&#x27;d hate to make any type of diagnosis over a medium like this, I feel you&#x27;ve been descriptive enough for me to make an educated guess.<p>Schizophrenia is a fairly complex disorder with varying levels of severity. What you described sounds very close to what a lot of people describe as their first &#x27;episode&#x27;, which commonly comes between the ages of 18-30. It includes what you&#x27;ve described, a long period of being awake, with intense thoughts, paranoia, and a inescapable need to &#x27;do something&#x27; (such as wipe your devices).<p>One of the greatest challenges of dealing with this is finding treatment fast enough before the disease progresses. Often once it progresses, the person no longer is able to realize something is wrong. As you&#x27;ve described it, you still have that sinking feeling that something isn&#x27;t right. Often at this stage general practitioners will not understand the disease enough to make a diagnosis, so it&#x27;s important you see a trained psychiatrist as soon as possible.<p>For your question about evaluating your condition objectively, this is part of the core treatment of Schizophrenia and it&#x27;s related disorders, so it would be best a doctor helps you with this. Adderral is a known to aggravate Schizophrenia as it interferes with Dopamine, I&#x27;d advise to cut down or stop taking it until you can speak to a doctor. There is also a very small chance you are experiencing a reaction to long term Adderall use it&#x27;s self, experiencing a Amphetamine psychosis which has very symptoms to Schizophrenia but is temporary. Do not risk it though, for a lot of people if Schizophrenia advances, they are unable, or refuse to seek treatment.",1444588697

Consider that:<p>* After Poland regained its independence in 1918/19, it had been a democratic republic until the May coup d&#x27;etat of 1926 under Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, arguably the most important figure in the creation of the Second Polish Republic and the rebirth of the nation&#x27;s independence. This de facto dictatorship lasted for less than 10 years. I know that we like to superficially assign without question an absolute superiority to democracy and view dictatorship as an absolute evil, but this depends on the particular characteristics of a given society, its situation, and its present needs as well as the kind of dictatorship we have in mind. Poland had been wiped off the map 123 years prior and divided into three parts by a joint conspiracy between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. It is strongly argued that without a dictatorship that would hold the nation together and guard it from foreign malice and its notoriously bad geopolitical predicament, Poland would have failed to survive as a state. There was a need for stabilization and coordination. Democracy presumes a certain status quo and does not bear chaos in such circumstances very well.<p>* Under Pilsudski&#x27;s rule, the situation of ethnic minorities (1/3 of the citizenry) actually improved considerably, though some of these minorities later colluded with the Nazi and Soviet regimes in exterminations of the Polish population. Pilsudski preferred to emphasize loyalty to the state over ethnicity, which was the policy of the National Democrats under Roman Dmowski, Pilsudski&#x27;s arch-rival (and who purportedly argued that ethnic minorities can add salt to the soup, though too much can ruin or destabilize a society, esp. when they fail to assimilate). In fact, Jews viewed him very favorably and their situation improved greatly especially under Pilsudski-appointed prime minister Kazimierz Bartel. Worth noting is that Pilsudski&#x27;s own wife was Jewish. So I&#x27;m not sure how the author drew the link between dictatorship and anti-semitism. Maybe he was looking for a cheap trope to appeal to to sell his story.<p>* The Polish variety of anti-Jewish feeling during this period was not racial in character. The &quot;Jewish Question&quot; concerned the problem of who and what Jews were in relation to the Polish nation. To say that Jews were being kept back is not really accurate. The situation was far more complicated. Many Jews who did assimilate were quite successful. However, it is false to assume that all Jews wanted to assimilate in the first place and simply weren&#x27;t welcome. Many had no such desire and purposefully maintained a separation from gentiles. Many were Zionists. Many had German loyalties. Some had Communist sympathies. During an era of nationalism where the state was rebuilding and trying to survive against the threat of Nazi German and Soviet Russian aggression, unknown or divided loyalties were  threatening. Furthermore, much of the resentment towards Jews, where it did exist, was economic in nature. While the aristocracy and the peasantry were about 2/3 Polish, the same proportions did not hold among the burghers where Jews were overrepresented. In other words, Polish-Jewish relations are complicates and require particular care if they are to be understood, not boorish generalizations that you often hear from bigots and the ignorant, no doubt the same people who use phrases such as &quot;Polish concentration camps&quot;.<p>* The greatest number of people honored at Yad Vashem are by far Poles. This is true despite that fact that only in Poland did Germany impose a death penalty that could be extended to the entire family for aiding and hiding Jews.<p>Other than that, I&#x27;m not sure how convincing the main argument seems to be. Gun control, like many polarizing topics, exists in an anti-rational domain that elevates a tool to some transcendental, fantastic order of Manichean symbols: you either have those who equate guns with freedom and those who equate it with evil incarnate. It is my opinion that whether gun training and ownership is not a matter of principle but a matter of contingent factors and pragmatism. For example, since we&#x27;re on the topic, I believe countries in historically geopolitically risky situation like Poland could benefit from widespread training if not ownership. Switzerland is arguably geopolitically safer place, but it has a trained populace in possession of firearms. The US has a very curious history with fire arms that differs from that of France, which does not mean stricter regulation of the gun market cannot be put in place. However, while gun ownership has been increasing, violence has been decreasing, esp. violence involving guns. There is no single number that can characterize the facts on the ground, but what it goes to show is that much of the &quot;public debate&quot; is merely the projection of preconceived notions, ideology, and emotion. There is barely any reason in it, merely arrogant presumption that the issue is obvious.",1444587987

10370293,comment,10369742,10370187,0,0,miguelrochefort,,,"A problem with most OO programming languages is that methods are declared as part of the class itself. This makes it difficult to extend an existing class you don&#x27;t control, or reuse a method elsewhere.<p>C# supports extension methods, which are basically static helper methods whose first parameter is the type to which you want to attach the method. For example, I could create a &#x27;ToTitleCase&#x27; extension method on type &#x27;string&#x27;. Then, given a string instance, I can simply do &#x27;myString.ToTitleCase()&#x27;.<p>One step further would be to add support for multiple parameters. For example, instead of listing all functions that accept an &#x27;int&#x27; as an argument, you could ask for all functions that accept both an &#x27;int&#x27; and a &#x27;string&#x27; as an argument. Given 3 and &quot;test&quot;, the &#x27;repeat&#x27; function could be suggested, resulting in &quot;testtesttest&quot;.<p>To make things even better, one could provide (explicitly or not) the  return type of the function they&#x27;re looking for. For example, if you&#x27;re assigning to a variable of type &#x27;int&#x27;, and all you have is a &#x27;string&#x27;, then you probably want to see a list of all functions that take a &#x27;string&#x27; as an argument, and return an &#x27;int&#x27;. In that case, you would see functions like &quot;parseInt&quot; or &quot;getLength&quot;. It&#x27;s kind of like playing domino, where you already know the type of the input and output, and only need to connect them together. Keep in mind that you can&#x27;t always transform one type to the other in a single function call, which means the system would also need to recommend combinations of functions, such as &quot;parseDateTime + getDayOfWeek&quot; when you need to transform a &#x27;string&#x27; to an &#x27;int&#x27;. Perhaps the name of the arguments could even be used as some kind of sorting heuristics (a &#x27;string&#x27; variable named &quot;date&quot; surely should be parsed to some kind of DateTime at some point).",1444587302

You&#x27;re probably interested in getting more serious about testing because of a couple of major defects that you have seen in the software after your last release. Create a test plan document that walks through the procedure of verifying those defects are not present in the software.  On each release, add to the test plan to make sure new features you&#x27;ve added work properly.  As you work on the product, the test plan will grow.  But it won&#x27;t grow as much as you might expect, because often several new features can be tested just by making a couple of edits to the test plan.<p>The goal of testing is to prevent defects from surfacing in production.  So track every defect that surfaces in production, so that you can watch that go to zero over time.<p>Whenever a defect comes up in production, edit the test plan such that you would have caught that defect.  Now you won&#x27;t be bitten by that class of defect in production again.<p>If you keep updating the test plan in this way you will see a dramatic drop in defects released to production.  Once you&#x27;ve done this for a while, you will probably discover that your biggest source of defects released into production have to do with how different your test environment is from your production environment.  So you will then start attacking that issue by setting up a proper staging environment, where the staging environment mirrors production as closely as practical.<p>Then you will start to discover that your biggest source of defects released into production becomes other things, such as little problems with your release methodology, which you can then address.<p>But the key concept here is: document what your test plan is, and continuously improve it.  It&#x27;s important to note that you must actually follow the documented procedure for this to work.  If you write a document so big that you won&#x27;t actually do it, you&#x27;re doing it wrong, make a smaller document.  If you feel like you only need to do 2 minutes worth of resting, document what you will do during those 2 minutes.  You can start with an empty test plan and that will work, as long as you continuously improve your test plan.  The same goes for the procedures that you use to deploy.  Always follow the same procedure exactly as documented, because you will need to improve that procedure.<p>I have followed these procedures at a number of companies and in a variety of environments, and seen it turn chaotic messes around many times.<p>Once you have this process down solid, you can automate some or all of it.  But the important thing is the overall set of processes around testing and deploying software, and the process for improving those processes.  How much of it is automatic versus manual matters a lot less.<p>As for resources, I&#x27;d recommend books on continuous improvement.  Because as you get better at testing, you&#x27;ll discover that General process improvement is what you really need in order to cover the range of things that cause defects in production.",1444586808

W. Ayer & Son created one of the most recognized slogans of the 20th century, A diamond is forever.<p>Harry Oppenheimer of De Beers and Ayer president Gerold M. Lauck discussed a marketing campaign in 1938 that would change the falling price of diamonds at the time. The idea of engagement rings decorated with diamonds wasn&#x27;t very popular in Europe, but interest in diamonds was high in the U.S. Because of this, Oppenheimer decided to promote the idea in the U.S. and told Lauck that, if Ayer&#x27;s plan was successful, De Beers would have Ayer become the exclusive agency for its American interests. Ayer was motivated to propose that its campaign should move the American spending demographic towards larger and more expensive diamonds.<p>To successfully achieve its goal, Ayer suggested a reinforcement of the relationship of diamonds with love and romance. This proved successful, as both men and women were caught in the relationship of diamonds being a gift of love. The slogan created for De Beers remained memorable for many years.</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._W._Ayer_%26_Son#De_Beers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._W._Ayer_%26_Son#De_Beers</a>",1444586689

Where I see this happening, is when people say ""Thank You"" over-enthusiastically, or in response to things that were done as a matter of course and deserve no thanks. The person being thanked is taken off-guard and slightly embarrassed to have been thanked for something which he would have done anyway. It feels like saying ""You're Welcome,"" would be to acknowledge the thanks-worthiness of the act in question, which would be a form of dishonesty, so they can't say that. On the other hand, it would be unambiguously rude to say nothing, so they mumble something non-committal in a vague attempt to to say, more or less, ""Really, it's nothing."" Why don't they just say that? Probably because they are taken off guard and slightly embarrassed</i><p>Really?

2024348,comment,2024073,2024277,0,0,lucasjung,,,"Let's break this down a little:<p>If you are a U.S. ally, you are unlikely to be invaded by the U.S. (kinda goes without saying, and you can insert pretty much any country you like in place of U.S. and the sentence remains true).<p>If you are a U.S. ally, what are your odds of being invaded by someone other than the U.S.?  Very low.  Why?  For the same reason that your leader would call the U.S. if you were invaded.  What if you're not in a formal alliance with the U.S.?  Odds are still pretty good that any potential aggressor will, before planning an attack, ask himself, ""Will the U.S. intervene if I invade my neighbor?""  If the answer is ""yes,"" he probably won't invade.  Keep in mind that the U.S. has fought wars because someone figured, incorrectly, that the answer was ""no.""<p>OK, what if you're not at all friendly with the U.S.?  In this case, there are a lot of other factors that come into play.  Are you a peer power?  If not, have you aligned yourself with such a power?  If so, how much are you worth to them?  How about nukes, do you have nukes?  If not, can you fake it credibly?  Are you generally belligerent and aggressive, or do you mostly mind your own business?  Keep in mind, these questions aren't just factors in determining your chances of being invaded by the U.S., they are factors in determining your chances of being invaded by anyone at all.<p>Summary: if your chances of being invaded are very low, it's most likely because of the existence of the U.S. military.  If that's not the reason, it's because you have a comparable military, or have aligned yourself with somebody who does.  If you're not on good terms with the U.S. you're in a more precarious position not just because the U.S. might invade you, but also because everyone else knows that the U.S. won't intervene on your behalf.  If you have nukes, only crazy people will invade you, unless you act so crazy that the sane countries decide that it's worth the risk to try and take them away, since you'll probably use them sooner or later anyway.",1292855071

2024291,comment,2024073,2024073,0,0,lucasjung,,,"""But the rejoinder ""you're welcome"", which once greeted almost any expression of thanks in America, is in retreat.<p>In its place is a sort of wordless acknowledgement, halfway between a grunt and a hum, ""mm-hmmm"". It is a sound that acknowledges your thanks but implies that no great joy has been found in helping you either.""<p>I agree with this 100% up until the last sentence, where he clearly indicates that he just doesn't get what's actually happening in these cases.  Where I see this happening, is when people say ""Thank You"" over-enthusiastically, or in response to things that were done as a matter of course and deserve no thanks.  The person being thanked is taken off-guard and slightly embarrassed to have been thanked for something which he would have done anyway.  It feels like saying ""You're Welcome,"" would be to acknowledge the thanks-worthiness of the act in question, which would be a form of dishonesty, so they can't say that.  On the other hand, it would be unambiguously rude to say nothing, so they mumble something non-committal in a vague attempt to to say, more or less, ""Really, it's nothing.""  Why don't they just say that?  Probably because they are taken off guard and slightly embarrassed.<p>The really perplexing thing about this is that just a few paragraphs later, he gives a prime example of this effect in action:<p>""It is curiously moving to see them sitting looking a little embarrassed as a pilot or flight attendant calls on their fellow passengers to give their service and sacrifice a standing ovation.""<p>They don't generally think of what they are doing as some sort of great sacrifice or heroic endeavor: they think of it as a job, and also as a way to give back to a country which has given them much.  If you look at their rank insignia, the majority of them are very junior, unlikely to have done anything in their thus-far short careers other than attend training.  They're probably thinking, ""These people think I'm some kind of war hero, and I haven't even done any real work yet, let alone deployed.""  I personally think that their service is nonetheless praiseworthy, but I'm not talking about the actual merits of their actions, I'm talking about their perception of those merits.  So when every ticket agent, TSA screener, gate agent, or flight attendant they come across says, ""Thank you for your service,"" they don't really feel justified in saying, ""You're welcome.""  Most eventually learn to smile brightly, look the other person in the eye, and cheerfully say, ""You're Welcome,"" because they learn that this is another form of service: it makes Americans feel good to express gratitude to those in uniform.<p>[EDITED a couple of typos]",1292854117

A foreigner being offered a ride from the airport without a stutter of consideration and being told ""this is America, son, we help each other out""... that if the fact that the U.S. Spends as much money on defense as the whole world combined concerns you, remember that the White House would he the first call made from your country if you were invaded...

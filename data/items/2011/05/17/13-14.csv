Not only has Amazon already stolen a march exactly where Google is most vulnerable with there advertising subsidized models, their current advertising model has much greater potential to extend the content of periodicals than the keyword driven highest bidder (aka frequently both irritating and irrelevant) model upon which Google relies. Finally, the lion's share of Amazon's revenue model in the slate market is based on providing consumers exactly what they ask for (books and slates) rather than primarily providing what third parties (advertisers) are willing to pay for.<p>There are sound available alternatives to Google's Gmail, Maps, and Search from which Amazon may choose.

Google does believe in this ""open"" nonsense. That is the whole idea. How is Amazon/Android vs. Google/Android any different than the current state of Motorola/Android vs. Samsung/Android vs. Google/Android vs. HTC/Android vs. etc? Google's whole plan is stay above the fray and just being the default operating system. Sure, Amazon have an app store, but Google is in the driver's seat here. They run the platform. If Amazon steps out of line (goes Bing, whatever) Google has plenty of tools to slap them on the wrist. Fork the platform in a new direction that renders Amazon's devices useless, and that is just off the top of my head. They have shown they can do this in the past by forcing with Samsung and Motorola going away from Skyhook. Of course, this will be portrayed in the Apple pundit media as an affront to openness, but Google is smart. They know that there is a way to be open and successful and a way to be open and be used.",1305640635

Two main reasons.  One is for actually looking up local telephone numbers.  I prefer this to looking them up on the Web in many cases: the paper book doesn't call home, the business directory is harder to game, and it's all pre-localized.  And it doesn't take away the choice of looking things up on the Web if I feel it's necessary, at the cost of some extra traceability &c.<p>The second reason is that I use extras as structural supports.  Monitor too low (for instance)?  Wrap phone book in duct tape.  Now it's a brick.  Construct environmental modifications out of phone bricks.  They're relatively light while being solid, and they're already bound together, so you don't have the trouble of trying to make the rectilinear shape ex nihilo.  I suppose I could buy stacks of newsprint paper or something, but going out and buying things is awkward, and phone books are often distributed free, so I'm only paying for time and duct tape.",1305640383

2556274,comment,2555562,2555562,3,0,wbhart,,,"To really understand the discrete fourier transform properly you need to understand the mathematical concept of a group. Fortunately, you only need to understand one particular group G, namely the integers mod n. Once one thinks of the input to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as a function on G (i.e. the input to the function is an element of G and the output is a complex number), then it is possible to frame the DFT in terms of a map between functions on G to functions on the dual of G (using something called Pontryagin duality). The thing is, functions on the dual of G multiply pointwise whereas functions on G itself multiply like polynomials mod x^n - 1.<p>Therefore to multiply polynomials, one thinks of them as functions on G, uses the DFT to take you to functions on the dual of G, multiplies pointwise, then does an inverse transform to get you back to functions on G again. I'm skimming over lots of details and oversimplifying a bit, but what I just described is the process of using a convolution to multiply polynomials.<p>The really great thing is if n is a power of 2. Then you have this cool Cooley-Tukey algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform to do the DFT (and IFFT) really fast (in time O(n log n) instead of O(n^2)). It works by recognising that computing an FFT is <i>precisely</i> the same thing as evaluating a polynomial at the n-th roots of unity. This can be done by repeatedly breaking the problem into halves and recognising that the same pattern of roots of unity occurs in the first half as in the second. By factoring that out, you can (recursively) save yourself half the work.<p>Again, oversimplified, but that's the nub of it.",1305638964

On the one hand we want to provide the best possible experience to the end-user, and on the other hand we want to include as many people as possible.<p>The two forces are in competition with each other though, because very often the largest group of people are running older technology.<p>We can broadly divide the potential user base into 3 groups. Those ""ahead"" with a cutting-edge browser, those with a ""modern browser"" and those ""left behind"". Today we'd consider IE6 users and Windows Mobile 6 users as ""left behind"". We'd consider HTML5 in a late-version of Chrome to be ""ahead"". Not surprisingly though the vast majority of people are in the middle.<p>The key question seems to be ""Is JavaScript in the mainstream?"". I think the answer to that is yes. Even IE6 has Ajaxian capable JavaScript. So therefore is the user-experience, of the many, improved by using JavaScript, to the point where the ""few"" are sacrificed? In my opinion, yes.<p>Certainly the user experience is improved immensely with the use of JavaScript. The question then becomes whether it is better to service say 95% (<i>) of the market really well, or 100% of the market in a mediocre fashion? I would argue that the market does not reward mediocrity - and the 5% you have gained are the least likely to appreciate your effort anyway.<p>(</i>) pick whichever number here you prefer.<p>Take an average hotel website for example? It's certainly all-inclusive, but at the same time is horribly unusable. It has evolved since 1995, and it's still as awful as it was then. Does a hotel gain 5% more occupancy for making it all inclusive, or do they lose more than 5% for having a horrible interface?<p>Personally I don't believe any site is ""all inclusive"". Those primitive enough to include the bottom end, are too dull for the folk on the top end. So the real question becomes, would you rather have the top, or bottom demographic?<p>Bearing in mind that for the vast majority the decision to not have JavaScript support is completely their own?<p>Now of course every site has different considerations. But in my opinion the starting point for the discussion is ""how much is that 5% worth?""<p>Will Modernizr make everyone happy all the time? Well, no. Then again, nothing will.",1305638791

With Modernizr, he'll (at best) get the watered down IE6 version with flat buttons and sharp corners, etc. At worst, if you're not doing progressive enhancement right and you've based critical functionality on one of the injected classes, you might cause some real problems for this user.<p>I guess I just see this as a limitation of Modernizr, and not a reason to throw out the baby with the bath water.

This is true and something that you have to be willing to accept to use it.<p>His proposed alternatives are strange however. He suggests server-side browser sniffing, a bad idea as the article itself explains. Alternatively he suggests using CSS cascading, but this is a bit of a tautology since this is the problem Modernizr was designed to solve.<p>My personal opinion is that Modernizr is a bit of a kludge, but often the least ugly option available.",1305637906

You can then pick one of two ways to generate your reports and transform your data. You can do them in real time - when a user requests the data. Or you can do it as a batch process and do the whole OLTP to OLAP offline.<p>On insert you calculate everything as each hit comes in and fill in your reporting structure directly.<p>Both the select with real-time report generation and the insert approach give users access to real time data. Select with an offline transformation script will provide cached data until the batch process is run again.<p>Imma guess that you're users want as-real-time as possible, with some data having to be more real-time than other. This is where you adopt some form of hybrid/mix.<p>As for actual implementation...First, can you afford to lose data? Now don't jump the gun and immediately say ""no"". A lot (but certainly not all) of analysis of this type of data works on averages and general trends. If you happen to lose a couple hundred rows in a couple hundred thousands, it doesn't really change the outcome that much. Anyways, it's important to know this because some storage engines support non-durable writes (writes to memory) which are stupid fast, but might result in lost data (or you can possibly write your own buffering logic in the app/web code to spin off another thread and write every 500 hits in a bulk-insert).<p>Technologies. MongoDB has a couple things going for it. First, writes are fast, and they can either be done to memory (stupid fast) or to disk (or to X replicas). Even writes to disk are pretty damn fast (to X replicas will largely depend on network latency). The other thing MongoDB has going for it is MapReduce...sadly it's single threaded, but whether you are doing real-time reporting on an offline OLTP->OLAP transformation, MapReduce is significantly more powerful than OrderBy.<p>In chapter 6 of the (free) Little MongoDB Book (<a href=""http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf</a>) I actually outlined the initial OLTP to OLAP process we were using for a very modest reporting tool.<p>Since then, we've switched to Redis and do it all on insert to provide real-time analytics. However, we are only tracking 3 very basic incrementing statistics. You can see the code here: <a href=""https://github.com/mogade/mogade-server/blob/master/app/models/stat.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mogade/mogade-server/blob/master/app/mode...</a> (the hit method).<p>Of course, why don't you just use Google Analytics?<p><i>EDIT:</i><p>If your data processing needs are truly huge, you'll likely end up with something like Hadoop (which I haven't had the opportunity/pleasure to need, so I can only mention it in passing).",1305637369

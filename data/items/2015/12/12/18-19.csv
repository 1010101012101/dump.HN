10723657,comment,10717003,10723454,0,0,mstade,,,"Having lived a number of years in London, both before and after Uber made an appearance, my experience is that black cab drivers generally have a better idea of where things are and how to get there – without the need of GPS – however that&#x27;s not to say they provide better service.<p>More than once have I had to tell my black cab driver that he&#x27;s going down an inefficient route, and it&#x27;s obvious (albeit difficult to prove) that this was on purpose to jack up the price for the ride. Worse: there&#x27;s no one I can call for a refund. In contrast, I&#x27;ve contacted Uber when this has happened with their drivers and always been given credits to make up the difference. Credits are no refund, for sure, but on the other hand I&#x27;ve kept using the service so I suppose it works out much the same.<p>On the other hand, more than once have I had to actually give my Uber driver turn-by-turn directions because the Uber app is terrible with routing, the driver ignores it, or both.<p>My best experience in London has been with Uber exec. The cars are nicer, the drivers are generally more knowledgeable and professional, and most importantly they&#x27;ve learned to not rely on Uber&#x27;s crappy mapping but rather use some other device to figure out the best route. More often than not, this means Google Maps (which, I think, Uber uses as well yet still manages to be useless) and some creative use of intermediate turns to avoid traffic – knowledge that likely comes from experience driving down London&#x27;s streets as opposed to studying maps in a class room.<p>There was a brief moment, before Uber had any significant presence in London, that an app called Hailo provided an Uber like experience but only contracted black cabs. This worked quite well, since they solved the two worst problems with black cabs, in my opinion:<p>1. Finding one\n2. Paying for it (most only deal in cash)<p>Uber obviously fixed both of these, but also provides more comfortable cars (at least on the exec level) and more often than not more professional drivers (hit and miss, the UberX level is a lottery.)<p>My typical experience with black cab drivers is that they are middle aged white males with a very conservative and xenophobic world view, lack of respect for women, and not afraid to share it. I&#x27;m white, and male, but still find this very uncomfortable and not something I like to support financially. Only once have I encountered a female black cab driver, and we even discussed that fact. She told me that she estimated the number of female drivers to be around 10% of the driver workforce, but I&#x27;ve seen numbers[1] to suggest it&#x27;s much lower than that.<p>In any event, these days if I have to travel to London, I exclusively use Uber Exec, simply because I find that service seems to hit the sweet spot of professionalism, service, and comfort, at a price that&#x27;s <i>still</i> cheaper than a black cab – and I don&#x27;t have to carry cash. That said, I feel no loyalty to Uber and if there was a competitor that could provide an experience with a more consistent track record (as mentioned UberX is hit-and-miss) I probably wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try them out.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.cglloyds.co.uk/news/2015/02/12/interview-with-Londons-Few-Female-Cab-Drivers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cglloyds.co.uk/news/2015/02/12/interview-with-Lo...</a>",1449945851

The idea is that the firmware burned into ROM is not user serviceable - that it&#x27;s never intended to be replaced and is intrinsically a part of the hardware.  To have a completely different view when it comes to firmware that is loaded at initialization time seems a bit silly to me.  This code is just as intrinsically a part of the function of the device, but instead of having to swap a board back to get a firmware update the firmware can be updated in the field.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/free-bios.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/free-bios.html</a>, specifically: &#x27;The ethical issues of free software arise because users obtain programs and install them in computers; they don&#x27;t really apply to hidden embedded computers, or the BIOS burned in a ROM, or the microcode inside a processor chip, or the firmware that is wired into a processor in an I/O device. In aspects that relate to their design, those things are software; but as regards copying and modification, they may as well be hardware. The BIOS in ROM was, indeed, not a problem.&#x27;",1449945692

Now in your 20s you want to sign up for a soccer league. The local league has multiple divisions for different ability levels. What do you do? Do you sign up for the highest, so that you can be exposed to great play? Or do you sign up for the division that matches your own ability? The answer for most people is obvious. You sign up for the division that matches your own ability. If you sign up for a top-level league, no one will pass the ball, and when you get the ball, you&#x27;ll have it taken away so fast you won&#x27;t have a chance to get better.<p>The idea that the best way to help someone who is behind, is to put them with those farthest ahead, is completely insane.

It is not helpful to be in classes with people who are far ahead of you, as you won&#x27;t get the practice on the basic, foundational topics that you need. You will be lost, and then fall even further behind. On the other hand, if you are grouped with people of your own ability, you have the opportunity to work hard, be among the best in the class, and feel much greater personal satisfaction.

When I was young I shared a few black shiny and big-headed cricket pets with my brothers. After hoping for hours in shorts, up and down the meadow, we returned to home and show our treasures: a wall lizard nest that we keep warm and wet until eclosion, three yellow and white butterflies, several grasshoppers and crickets... Males and females are easy to identify. Two males can not be put in the same cage and want to live isolated most of the time. We hunt and keep them for a while before to be released again in the meadow. Boys nowadays just keep excited pressing buttons all the evening instead, a really sad way to spend a glorious summer evening in my opinion. We liked to hear it singing in the balcony at night, is a relaxing sound. You could go to a news stand then and buy small plastic cages specially for housing crickets. (Cardboard boxes are just not good enough, because crickets will chew a hole in a coin and escape).<p>I can&#x27;t help to point that this toy is a luxury palace for a cricket by comparison with our small cages.

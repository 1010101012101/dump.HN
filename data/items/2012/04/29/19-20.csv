3906881,comment,3906526,3906645,6,0,robomartin,,,"There's a much deeper question on the whole concept of taxation in general.  What is it for and where should the limits be?<p>If you really look around you'll quickly learned that everything is taxed.  Everything.  Politicians have gotten very good at finding all sorts of areas where they can insert a probe and extract ""blood"".  From gasoline to telephones, communications, dogs, cars, food, air travel, tobacco, etc.  Here's one attempt at a list:\n<a href=""http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/taxed-enough-already"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/taxed-enough-alr...</a><p>Here in California it is not uncommon to hear of more hair-brained schemes to levy taxes on more things.  A little-bit here and a little-bit there and politicians have collect billions to keep their gravy train going.<p>Regardless of whether we are talking about personal or corporate taxes, or taxes in general, it is important to always keep in mind what the ""mission statement"" might be for taxes.  Lately the lines on this have blurred.<p>In general terms taxes should be used to run the government, military and reasonable social services (the last one being debatable).<p>Lately, at least in California and other similarly-afflicted states, a huge percentage of taxes are being dedicated to supporting a ridiculous pension infrastructure and a bloated government and public employee sector. Tax increases are being proposed with the sole purpose of finding funding for union pensions.  We, then, exist to ensure that the union ""class"" gets to live happily every-after with their wonderful lifetime pensions and healthcare.  This is beyond wrong.  This is criminal.<p>I don't have a problem with the idea of questioning if large companies are paying what they are legally supposed to.  At the same time, the system should also demand that government be responsible and not exist to create and maintain their own ecosystem through the abuse of taxation.  Name one government entity that, over the last few years, has put forth cuts and savings measures on par with families and businesses across this nation.  Exactly.<p>Watch closely what is happening with the post office.  Here's a clear case of a government entity that should start to see massive cuts and reorganization.  What do you want to bet that we carry these people on our taxes for the rest of our lives?  So, rather than being able to devote our money to the furthering of our own kids and culture we are obligated, through taxation, to support useless hordes of government employees.  This isn't going to end well.",1335729526

A team behind a proven software for Windows or OSX could say ""Hey look we've made this great tool for Windows/OSX users and made a lot of money on it.. We'll bring it to Linux if we raise X amount of dollars"". The Linux users are significant enough and generous enough (as proven by the humble bundles) that it would work financially and would make the Linux ecosystem explode with new variety.<p>Open source developers on the other hand might find it easier to raise funds and continue to hack away on their projects with a similar solution.

It's just that the way it's phrased, it sounds like Unicode's design <i>contributed</i> to this NULL-terminal problem, when in fact even NULL-terminated ASCII strings cannot 'handle' a null character in this sense.<p>To augment your idea, though, how about you use '0xFF 0x00' as a terminator?

3906851,comment,3906760,3906760,1,0,thisisstupid,,,"Hi Andrew,<p>I agree with the premise of your post - (top) CS departments do offer machine learning / stats classes in later year of their programmes. I, myself, am taking probabilistic modelling and ML at the graduate level (although, still an undergrad).<p>What I disagree is that a main thing data scientists do is ""work with regular expressions (not hard!), find, grep, sed, awk, and other Unix tools"". In fact, if you've done any work on real datasets and have, say, 40GB of data, the last thing you want to be doing is writing regexps or playing with awk. Instead, you want to parallelize your pre-processing steps with Hadoop, or, perhaps, some other higher-level MapReduce framework.<p>Now that you have data this big, you also run into another problem - Matlab is no longer capable of loading your data into RAM. So this is where various stochastic sampling techniques come into play. And once you're done building your model, then you might want to use your full dataset. At this point, we again turn to Hadoop and, perhaps, Mahout.<p>To sum this up, the premise of your article is correct, but the advice you're giving is not, given the context. Sure, awk, grep and other Unix tools are good to know and learn, but won't help you much beyond working with small datasets.

For example NUL (U+0000) can be encoded as 00 or as C0 80. The second encoding is illegal because it's longer than necessary and forbidden by standard, but naive parser may extract NUL out of it. If UTF-8 input was not properly sanitized, or there is a bug in charset converter, this may result in exploit like SQL injection or arbitrary filesystem access or something like that: malicious party can encode not only NUL, but "", /, \ etc this way.<p>Also UTF-8 string can't be cut at arbitrary position. Byte groups (UTF-8 runes) must be processed as a whole, so appear either on left side or on the right side of cut.<p>Reversing of UTF-8 string is tricky, especially when illegal character sequences are present in input string and corresponding code points (U+FFFD) must be preserved in output string.<p>I think UTF-8 for network transmitted data and disk I/O is inevitable, but our software should keep all in-memory strings in UCS-4 only, and take adequate security precautions in all places where conversion between UTF-8 and UCS-4 happens.<p>And sizeof(wchar_t)==4 in GCC ABI is not a design defect, wchar_t exists for a good reason.

And, contrary to Mr. O'Reilly's assertions at the beginning of his piece, I don't say this because I think Apple can spend its money better than the US Government can. For this argument, I don't care either way because it's irrelevant; he merely dismissed a strawman.<p>The question has to do with our tax code. Is it achieving the goals that we created it to achieve? If so, then there is nothing to discuss, so presumably it's not.

That's basically how the QFN[1] and other 'no-leads' ICs are mounted.<p>There are 2 big problems though: You've got a huge overhang area, so if you do use flux, it's not going to be able to escape, and will stay as voids in the joint. But if you don't, you'll have to find some other way to replicate the cleaning and oxide stripping behaviour in order to get the solder to bond properly. Chemical cleaning and then storage/soldering in an inert atmosphere might help, but I don't know.<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it's really quite hard to reflow (heat to melting point) the solder layer attached to your big heatsink, without bringing the whole assembly up to that temperature (what with the whole point of the heatsink being to get heat away from there as fast as possible). And if you do that, even if you don't fry the chip straight away, you've now got all that thermal energy stored in the large mass of the heatsink to dissipate. And it has to be done relatively evenly to avoid mechanical stress on the joint due to material expansion/contraction.<p>Actually yeah, having thought it through, it is going to be pretty tricky :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-flat_no-leads_package"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-flat_no-leads_package</a>",1335727426

Several investors, declining, confirmed to me that the amount I was asking for was frighteningly low. I showed breakdowns of what would go to hiring and equipment, what would go to advertising, and what was the emergency fund - ($100k) - and how we really wouldn't need more because it would start paying for itself quickly. That wasn't satisfying to them.<p>What I also didn't know was that turning a profit was the last thing on their minds. It took me awhile to piece that together. I have to thank HN for opening my eyes to it.<p>The problem with speculative investors is that they aren't producing anything of value. They aren't building the software, they aren't in the trenches trying to acquire users or running customer service.<p>So I launched with a couple of friends who threw in some very, very small investments of a few grand, rented the equipment I would have wanted to buy, and ran it myself. And I haven't been able to grow it nearly as fast as I would have wanted to. But y'know what? It's making a profit. I just paid a 12.4% dividend on investments for the first quarter. Average time on the site is 45 minutes. We convert 1.5% of users at an average of $75 each. And I hold 81.5% of the company.<p>So... are investors looking for massively overhyped, vaporous, disruptive monster-IPOs wrong? No, but it's kind of like going to the track and only betting on the longest-shot horses you can find.

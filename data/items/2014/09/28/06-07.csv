8379139,comment,8376458,8378232,2,0,dottrap,,,"Linus Torvalds was just at Debconf14 and specifically addressed how broken shipping application binaries for Linux desktop is.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmHRSeA2c8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmHRSeA2c8</a><p>The most relevant parts start at about 6min and 41min.<p>Highlights:<p>- .deb vs .rpm misses the whole point. The problem is application writers just want to ship an application binary for &quot;Linux&quot;, but it is a nightmare.<p>- Except for the kernel which strives for ABI stability, everything else in the Linux distros constantly break binary compatibility, including the most important library, glibc.<p>- Package maintainers are forced to use shared libraries for everything, even packages that are unstable and not well used which means apps will break<p>- You can&#x27;t install packages under these systems as non-root<p>- He ships binaries for his SCUBA diving app for Windows and OS X. He only ships source for Linux. That&#x27;s sad.<p>- Static linking is a possible solution, but that is sad too.<p>(For the record, he points to Valve as a potential savior but says they will probably do the sad thing of static linking. They aren&#x27;t doing quite this. They ship a set of dynamic libraries called Steam Runtime that all Steam games can draw from. Better than static linking, but still kind of sad.)<p>At the 41 minute segment, a user celebrates the &quot;good backwards compatibility&quot; for a 19 year binary he still has, and Linus points out that is &quot;patting ourselves on the back&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t address the real compatibility issues which are modern binaries.<p>I can attest to the glibc hell. Another simple example is clock_gettime(). Just trying to ship a binary between Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 is enough to bang your head. (I think this problem appears between 12 and 13 too.) On one version, it is found in glibc, but in the other it is in librt. This prevents the binary from working on both.<p>Linus also criticizes Java (mentioned in the parent). That didn&#x27;t work for him either.<p>As for Windows, Windows still has DLL-hell. It&#x27;s sad that Microsoft won&#x27;t ship their Visual Studio common C and C++ runtimes with the OS (MSVC*dll), even though they finally put version numbers in the file name now. And they make it harder than it should be to deploy your app with them. However, this is still a vast improvement over what Linux distros are doing (as Linus points out).<p>(edit: formatting)",1411887385

8379134,comment,8377345,8379030,1,0,Rapzid,,,"Thanks for the reply Darren.  I had actually read all of the cattle.io docs and have started poking through the source code.  My initial reaction was that I <i>really</i> liked how the orchestration of resources was modelled as a type of state machine.  It really clicked for me and I could see how something like this would have value on it&#x27;s own as a sort of run-deck or the like.  It also simplifies the agents.. I can see how creating a .Net agent would be dead simple, and I&#x27;m a firm believer that if you&#x27;re orchestrating on Windows you&#x27;ll end up wishing you were using .Net eventually if you aren&#x27;t already.<p>But to the topic at hand, I was a bit confused about how the bidding comes in to play with Diego.  After reading the Diego design notes, <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-design-notes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-design-notes</a> , I&#x27;m believing this mostly has to do with the scheduling.  So it seems to be an alternative to the omega-style serialized scheduler of Flynn, or however Fleet handles this.  My current understanding is that stampede.io relies on Fleet to handle scheduling, I&#x27;m not sure how stock cattle.io gets about it..  It would seem CF still has high-level orchestration(going from staging, then running, etc) and that a comparison between the two systems would be more involved than I had thought(that and cattle.io concerns itself with IaaS as well) :|",1411887186

8379077,comment,8377680,8378963,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Can you expand a little bit on that line of reasoning?<p>Yes, certainly. Einstein was called out on his frequent allusions to god in his public talks and writings, and under some pressure he finally described how he saw god and religion.<p>Einstein said that his references to god were in fact with respect to Spinoza&#x27;s god, an abstract god who played no part in human affairs and that bore no resemblance to the god religious believers picture. In other words, nature -- not a judge, but a morally neutral environment.<p>> But let&#x27;s consider a different claim: that the existence of God, the origin and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason.<p>But that&#x27;s not possible without evidence. Let me explain the difference between a scientist&#x27;s attitude toward issues of fact, and a religious believer&#x27;s attitude.<p>To a religious believer, a claim is assumed to be true until evidence proves it false. To a scientist, a claim is assumed to be <i>false until evidence proves it true</i> -- the exact opposite.<p>Why do scientists take this position, formally known as the <i>null hypothesis</i>? Because it&#x27;s the only rational way to address issues of evidence. Let&#x27;s take Bigfoot as an example -- to a nonscientist, Bigfoot exists until his nonexistence is proven. But disproving Bigfoot&#x27;s existence requires <i>proof of a negative</i>, which is an impossible evidentiary burden.<p>Bigfoot could be hiding under some rock on a distant planet, therefore proving his nonexistence is not possible, therefore Bigfoot exists. Therefore everything exists -- UFOs, fairies, a teapot orbiting out in space in Bertrand Russell&#x27;s famous argument on this issue (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_teapot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_teapot</a>), and god -- all without a shred of evidence.<p>Imagine if law adopted a religious outlook -- people would be guilty of any crimes they were <i>unable to prove they didn&#x27;t commit</i>. But law (at least in modern times) adopts an approximately scientific attitude toward evidence, usually codified as &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot;<p>This is the real meaning of the chasm between religion and science, and it&#x27;s not a trivial one.<p>> To develop the idea we might reasonably consider whether any of the loftier domains of the physical sciences, e.g. physical cosmology, can tell us anything about God&#x27;s existence.<p>Very easy to answer -- without evidence, no such claim can be sustained.

8379075,comment,8378065,8378964,4,0,nkurz,,,"My first thought was that this was an interesting approach, but that there was no speed advantage because of the cache flush and pipeline reset.  But maybe it could be made to work...<p>What if instead of overwriting an existing instruction, you generated the instructions you needed and appended them to a new writable and executable buffer. Then every 100/1000/1000000 characters, you terminate it with a &#x27;ret&#x27; and &#x27;call&#x27; into it.   It branchlessly updates the set of XMM/YMM/ZMM registers you are using without touching memory.  Repeat until you&#x27;ve read to the end of your input, then store the vector register results by writing their contents out to RAM in a known order.  Perhaps you cycle between a few buffers so that the address you are calling into is never cached.<p>Overkill, but it seems like this might actually be pretty fast, presuming you can generate the instructions fast enough.  I&#x27;ve considered this technique before for fast integer decompression when trying to avoid branch errors, but never so far as to actually test it.",1411884261

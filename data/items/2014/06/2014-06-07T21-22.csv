You object to my surveillance activities and ask discovery of same. My evidence that Carol is a spy may be obviously privileged, but if I give you my files on Alice, Bob, and Donald it&#x27;s easy to guess that I view Carol as somehow different from the others.<p>Now, I could in theory furnish minimal information on Carol that would not clearly distinguish her from the other three, but that puts the Executive Branch in the awkward position of making judgments about what degree of truth it is appropriate to provide, which is the sort of thing that is properly the province of the Judicial Branch. So the Executive Branch argues that compliance would necessarily mean an abrogation of Judicial Branch functions if it is not to impair he Executive Branch&#x27;s lawful security function, and now you&#x27;ve got a separation-of-powers problem.<p>What happens in many cases and <i>may</i> happen in this one, is that if there isn&#x27;t a clear legal principle which guides the balance of the interests the Court may review the material in question and decide exactly what should be handed over and what can be retained, which decision might then be appealed to  higher court by one party or the other.",1402178325

If the two players flip coins to chose their sides they will both end up winning 50% of games in the long run. Likewise if they are able to randomize their choices perfectly, they will both win 50% of games.<p>If your opponent plays in a sub-optimal manner (e.g. they chose the left side more often than the right), then the best strategy to use is an <i>exploitative</i> one (e.g. I see you chose left more than right so I always chose left), however, in this case you gain by changing your strategy (so no Nash equilibrium).<p>I can&#x27;t see any way to &#x27;beat&#x27; this simple game and win more than 50% of games in the long run without using an exploitable strategy, so it seems that chimps have somehow evolved to become better at playing this game in a game theory optimal manner than us.",1402178278

However, to use this value in a collection like a List or Map, the compiler must convert it into an Integer object.<p>...<p>> So an integer in Java frequently looks more like this and consumes between 16 and 24 bytes of memory.<p>> This is a Location type which holds the location of some object in three dimensional space. It is written in Go, so each Location consumes exactly 24 bytes of storage. We can use this type to construct an array type of 1,000 Locations, which consumes exactly 24,000 bytes of memory.<p>You could have constructed an array of 3,000 ints in Java also for 24,000 + a header bytes of memory.<p>Go has been around for 4+ years now.

The Bill of Rights is the collection of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, and made so under the power conveyed by Article 5 of the Constitution. Article 5 clearly allows for amendments to the Constitution, and a clear instance of when this is the case is in Article 1 Section 9 Paragraph 4 being amended by contrary language in the 16th Amendment. However, not all amendments are clearly contrary to, or magnifying the verbiage of the original text. In these cases, it is up to the courts to decide.

The Magic Mouse excels at some key areas, but it&#x27;s vastly inferior in some others. Overall, it ends up being worse for certain types of uses (long term, high performance).<p>Here&#x27;s the breakdown of the Magic Mouse for various mousing tasks:<p>Vertical Scrolling - the Magic Mouse is hands down way better than G9 or any other mouse.<p>Horizontal Scrolling - Magic Mouse wins here even harder than at vertical scrolling. This is definitely one of its highlights.<p>Pointer tracking - it&#x27;s not as good as a gaming grade laser mouse, but it&#x27;s good enough. This isn&#x27;t the part that makes people hate it.<p>Gestures - pretty good, but not as amazing as the Magic Trackpad. Better than normal mouse that have none, but &quot;decent gesture support&quot; is not necessary better than &quot;no gesture support&quot;, because it should be great to be usable.<p>Left clicking - okay.<p>Right clicking - not so great. You have to physically lift your left finger so it doesn&#x27;t touch the mouse surface in order to right click. This is okay to do once every 5-10 minutes, but more often than your hand will get tired really fast.<p>Now, here&#x27;s the part that absolutely kills the mouse and the main reason why so many people dislike it, IMO.<p>Switching between various modes - performs really poorly compared to, e.g., Logitech G9 or pretty much any other standard mouse. Here&#x27;s a worst case benchmark that showcases the weakness here: imagine you need to, in rapid succession, do a left click, right click, scroll a fixed amount, repeat. Try doing that as fast as you can on for 90 seconds on a Magic Mouse. Your hand will be extremely tired, because each of the 3 modes of operation are best performed using different hand positions. On the other hand, with a mouse like G9, your hand position is almost identical for all 3 tasks. So alternating between them is effortless in comparison.<p>So the bottom-line is: the magic mouse excels at some key areas (which makes some people love it), but fails really hard at some other (less noticeable to the average user) key areas and becomes really tiring to use at high performance for longer periods of time (which makes people hate it).<p>It&#x27;s an example of Apple failing to build a &quot;great _all around_&quot; experience that they usually succeed at (see MacBook Pro Retina, iPhone hardware, etc.).",1402177653

The central question, which they never address, is whether a massive change of ease of discovery of information is a quantitative or a qualitative change.  Much of this information was always available -- eg for minor criminal history, if you had the resources to go county by county and check.  Pretending that it&#x27;s somehow inherently true or obvious that when a 2 second effort on google unearths the same information that the same rules should apply is simply stupid.  There&#x27;s a real debate we should have about what information should be available, about whom, for how long, with what expirations, etc, and Jimmy and Eric Schmidt and the founders of google aren&#x27;t obviously right.  Also, we should just in general be wary of rich assholes; all those people won&#x27;t suffer consequences whereas plenty of non rich people do suffer consequences.<p>Also, saying that a very powerful privacy tool that forces google to forget certain information makes it hard to make &quot;real progress on privacy issues&quot; makes one wonder what exactly he thinks privacy is.  And you can see below that he deliberately conflates freedom of speech -- which individuals will continue to enjoy -- with the instant and easy availability of all information (as commercially selected by Google, etc).<p>And again, fta, we see that Jimmy is another rich asshole -- just like Eric Schmidt -- that thinks he should have privacy, but you shouldn&#x27;t:<p><pre><code>   Back in 2005, Wales admitted to editing his own Wikipedia bio — a practice \n   frowned upon by the site.

But he did agree to \n   answer our other questions about the committee’s role and his personal views \n   on the ECJ ruling.

In fact, my typed notes usually contained more information (as the article notes) since I am a much faster typist than writer.<p>In both cases, I basically wrote down what the professor said. It might have been abbreviated, and I wouldn&#x27;t bother with things I didn&#x27;t think mattered, but they were very much essentially an unstructured and disjointed narrative of the class. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had the time to structure them (into say, pro/con lists) because that kind of information often was something I could only extract after the fact. For example, a professor might start speaking about a particular subject, mention a benefit to that approach (pro, right?!) but then go on another five minutes about what that entailed, leaving that part of my notes long behind and so keeping me from really structuring it as a pro/con list. If I thought a professor was saying something especially important I might sit there, absorb it, and frantically write down a condensed version as he started into something else, but that was as close as I got to any kind of structure.<p>On the very rare occasions I reread and reorganized my notes, I did do something of the sort. But I rarely bothered because a) my notes were hardly readable in the first place and b) it didn&#x27;t seem worth it since I already understood the material by that time. Oddly, I think my bad handwriting might have contributed to the quality of my notes: when I did go back and read them, I had to read them very slowly, again and again, to understand them and I often had to fill in several words from context since they were mostly illegible.",1402176831

It would only be reasonable that such programs be, at a minimum, prepared for court oversight. If preservation of evidence cannot be guaranteed then the program should not be used to enforce the law. I find it particularly troubling that this system was not only never envisioned to be used to pursue a warrant from the courts, but also designed to make it impossible to do so by making the act of proving the legality of the evidence collected by making a chain-of-custody analysis deliberately conflict with national security interests. I believe this is clearly analogous to a defensive weapon which is designed to kill enemies of the country, but although it regularly also kills civilians the government refuses to allow it to be inspected (and potentially fixed) using the excuse that turning it off would harm even more civilians. I unequivocally support the defence and enforcement of our national security, political and economic interests.

If someone seeks to be offended to avoid having to engage with the actual argument, that&#x27;s on them, and they probably didn&#x27;t need the pretense of caring about the insult to begin with.<p>> The question is: was it deliberate, or was it simply an error, or a misunderstanding? People make mistakes, that&#x27;s unfortunate, but it&#x27;s understandable.<p>The problems with google&#x27;s approach have been pointed out almost immediately after their policy became known. If it was a simple mistake in the sense of an accident, it would have been corrected then. Google might not have set out to cause harm, but drafting their policies and sticking to them in contempt of the harm they are causing is a deliberate, voluntary move.<p>For a hamhanded car analogy, if someone parks in a parking space for the disabled out of laziness, and now some guy in a wheelchair has to cover another block&#x27;s worth of distance because he had to park elsewhere, it&#x27;s not okay just because they didn&#x27;t do it to cause him harm, it&#x27;s still bad because they didn&#x27;t care enough about not causing him harm to avoid it. Something that hurts a disadvantaged group out of disregard for their needs rather than out of malice is still cause for offense and not just a mistake.<p>> In a different culture, it might well be the worse thing you could say to someone.<p>I think that&#x27;s really unlikely. I might conjecture a hypothetical culture where insults are expected and polite, but I think it&#x27;s sufficient to look at the actual cultural context.

7863124,comment,7862973,7863089,8,0,stevejohnson,,,"Genuine answer here. There&#x27;s no need to apologize for not constantly immersing yourself in the workings of Apple platforms. :-)<p>JavaScript is just another interface to Apple&#x27;s &quot;Open Scripting Architecture (OSA).&quot; Previously, AppleScript was the only way to use it. The fact that they added another language indicates nothing about whether OSA will ever come to iOS. My guess is it won&#x27;t; the new extensions APIs will likely handle any inter-app communication Apple wants to allow, because they are designed with iOS&#x27;s sandbox model in mind already.<p>Put another way, Javascript is to AppleScript with respect to OS X automation, as Scala is to Java on the JVM. The existence of Scala does not indicate that the JVM will be ported to the Haiku OS. (There may be a better analogy but that&#x27;s what I came up with.)",1402175824

7863121,comment,7862577,7862717,9,0,anigbrowl,,,"It&#x27;s not the preservation of the data that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s the collision of civil procedure discovery rules with natioanl security issues: <i>The EFF had wanted the NSA to preserve all data collection in bulk, regardless of what legal authority it was collected under — that way, the government would be forced to hand it over as part of the discovery process as the case moves forward.</i><p>In general, disputants in civil litigation have to provide complete transparency. If I sue you over a business matter, for example, you have to provide <i>everything</i> that you might have on record in relation to that business matter, not just those documents which are responsive to my initial complaint. My lawyers will then pore over those records and file an amended complaint that makes maximum use of <i>your</i> information against you. In turn, your lawyers will almost certainly counter-sue me and make a similar request for my documents on the matter, to find out whether I know something that you don&#x27;t. This is completely different from a criminal warrant, where the state has to articulate in advance waht it&#x27;s looking for (although such requests can be fairly broad).<p>The reason it works this way is because civil itigants are ofen at a severe disadvantage. If I have a bad experience with BigCorp and sue, I don&#x27;t know in advance what specific documents or records to request for evidence, because I&#x27;m not privy to BigCorp&#x27;s inner workings, have no insight into which BigCorp employees or managers were involved with the situation or what actions they took, and so it would be very easy for BigCorp to give me the runaround - an experience most people are familiar with if they&#x27;ve ever had a problem with a bank or received poor customer service from a large organization. So the civil discovery process is designed to correct that imbalance by giving a plaintiff&#x27;s attorney access to all the same information as the defendant&#x27;s attorneys, and allowing plaintiffs to amend their complaint for greater specificity after the discovery process. (Of course this system can be abused too; some defendants will deliberately swamp a plaintiff with far more information than actually requested, in order to leave the plaintiff&#x27;s attorney&#x27;s looking for a needle in a haystack. Attorneys usually contract out that research task and after the verdict is passed down there is often further litigation about the appropriate assignment of expenses.)<p>Now, of course  the discover process can involve a defenedant having to hand over a great deal of information that is <i>not</i> relevant to the actual dispute, with negative implications for privacy and business confidentiality. But since attorneys are all officers of the court, they are bound as part of their license not to make public any information they receive which is not responsive to the matter being litigated. For example, suppose a plaintiff&#x27;s attorney discovers that the CEO of BigCorp is having an extramarital affair, but that fact isn&#x27;t germane to the litigation. The plaintiff&#x27;s attorney would be subject to severe sanctions, maybe even disbarment, for leaking or threatening to reveal that information at trial in hopes of causing embarrassment or jury bias towards BigCorp.<p>So here the EFF is saying (as is normal) &#x27;give me everything you&#x27;ve got, our lawyers will sort through it and cherry pick it for relevance.&#x27; The NSA is arguing in turn that it can&#x27;t do so because the EFF&#x27;s legal team doesn&#x27;t have the relevant security clearances, and that the public&#x27;s security interest eclipses the public&#x27;s transparency interest - which may well be true, in Constitutional terms. A lto of people liek to argue that the Constitution, or more specifically the Bill of Rights, exists to protect the people from government tyrrany, but the BoR is only part of the constitution and doesn&#x27;t automatically trump other parts. The Constitution also grants a large number of powers to government and the legal authority derived from that stands on an <i>equal</i> footing with the public&#x27;s interests that are articulated in the Bill of Rights.",1402175718

If a company can solve this problem, document how you&#x27;ve done it (AFTER the fact) and present it to a board of government scientists. If they believe you, you get the prize money.<p>And make the prize money something like $5 billion or so. Chump change for what you&#x27;re asking for. Besides, it has to be an amount that would provide decades of comfort for a company of at least a dozen people + a nice reward for any investors.<p>This worked for draining swamps in the late middle ages. It worked for building things like clocks and compasses, and these sorts of prizes is how ocean-capable ships were designed in the first place. I would argue that the (early) prizes were for &#x27;allow a ship to navigate without any visible markers on the ground&#x27;, about as nebulous a concept as &#x27;lower atmospheric co2 by 50% - or at least prove you can do it&#x27; would be.",1380883802

6494648,comment,6493839,6494188,2,0,kmdev,,,"Unfortunately, your assumption that less money to consumers translates to wiser financial decisions is incorrect. It&#x27;s well studied that quite the opposite behavior occurs and for good reason; more stress and less access to time saving goods and services. On top of the huge disadvantage that levies on a person, the things that person DOES need start costing more. In the vast majority of the states, having a car is a necessity to work. Loans cost more if you can even get one so you end up spending what little is there on a clunker and all the time and energy that goes in to that heap. Uh oh, now you can get to your job, but if you&#x27;re working anywhere near minimum wage and have a family (that doesn&#x27;t just include kids and spouses, but also elderly parents (whose social security and medicare aren&#x27;t enough), you won&#x27;t have the cashflow to keep everything going. So you end up with a payday loan and so on. I think everyone has the picture by now.<p>You mention that the &#x27;right&#x27; industries will shrink and the &#x27;wrong&#x27; will expand. Let&#x27;s make that leap and follow it through, ignoring the pedantry of arguing what&#x27;s a &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;wrong&#x27; industry. I get the point you&#x27;re trying to make with that. There are two obvious paths. First, that as it stands now, increased corporate profits has not translated to increasing wages or employment. Regardless of whether the &#x27;right&#x27; or &#x27;wrong&#x27; industries expand, that still translates to less money in the hands of those that have the most need to spend it. The article does a much better job communicating the consequences of that. On the second path, I&#x27;ll ignore the previous and just look at the overall growth consequences. If we assume that indeed only the industries producing things consumers need expand that eliminates a ton of research, development and source of unexpected discoveries (and jobs and wages and... I digress). How many &#x27;useless&#x27; web apps and services are out there that also contribute to open source? Did consumers really need Google? Not at all, but damn if we don&#x27;t all enjoy many of the things Google has contributed to our sector.<p>The following isn&#x27;t in reply to you, Kokey, but I want to get it out there.<p>Of course government spending on things that don&#x27;t contribute to real growth are a terrible idea. Government spending on infrastructure, education and healthcare, however, contribute more than the sum total of their costs. Most like to use the NASA example to illustrate that point, but how about finally investing in upgrading our power grid? A nationwide upgrade would put hundreds of thousands to work including a huge number of engineers and other knowledge jobs. Not to mention, we&#x27;d also be increasing our knowledge, expertise and intellectual property as a nation in a sector vital to every country on the globe during the process. What about using the next few billion we were going to subsidize telcoms with to upgrade our internet infrastructure (I don&#x27;t know anyone who has been informed of the billions given to telcoms to upgrade infrastructure that wasn&#x27;t used for that at all, that wasn&#x27;t furious about it)? But what about healthcare? Surely that&#x27;s just a money pit, right? A healthy population is more productive. Simple as that.<p>I doubt anyone reading this can&#x27;t see that these kinds of large government spending projects and programs pay for themselves many times over in all sorts of varying ways.",1380883424

Surely they must have the tightest and most restrictive regulations with OSHA being such a pest. I think some people on the gulf coast would like to have a word with you.<p>Surely deregulation will lead to more competitive free markets! Take a look at the 19th and early 20th century economy for some excellent examples of how wonderful monopolies are (railroads, oil, etc). I&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;re not against government regulation of utility infrastructure since I&#x27;ll assume you wouldn&#x27;t like hoping a company will decide your area is profitable enough to build out or having to have new wiring and piping run to your house to switch to a competitors infrastructure.<p>Labor laws. Pffft. Who needs those? We have unions to ensure businesses don&#x27;t mistreat workers. Oh wait. Surely an employer would never take advantage of someone to pad their bottom line. Yeah.<p>Are there areas where the government does some ridiculous things? Sure. Does it cost money to protect and treat workers respectfully? Sure.

6494618,comment,6493510,6494524,7,0,chris_wot,,,"I&#x27;ll deal with what I wrote only, not the rest of your silliness :-)<p>The basic argument is that those who want restrictions to content have been attempting to chip away at what is essentially an open platform. While the W3C&#x27;s argument is that it is an &quot;extension&quot; to the HTMLMediaElement, and while the draft goes to great pains to state that it is not a DRM system, in actual fact it goes a great way towards allowing for a DRM system.<p>If you review the diagram in the draft [1], you will see that it covers playback of certain content. Currently, it is restricted to media files. But you can see that once this is adopted, it would then lower the barriers for media companies and other interested actors to push for encryption mechanisms for individual elements.<p>Even worse, note that the Content Decryption Module (CDM) is a &quot;part of or add-on to the user agent that provides functionality for one or more Key Systems&quot;. In other words, these will probably need to be implemented as binary blobs which are add-ons for browsers. They may need to use specific technologies that are part of particular operating systems.<p>What does this leave us all with? Well, it leaves us with the promogulation of a bad idea (restrictive DRM) implemented using a variety of browser specific extensions that may need to utilise the specific technologies of a particular operating system.<p>As an example, you could be forced to use an add-on for Internet Explorer that can only be used on Windows 8.<p>So in other words, the plan is a bad one for technical reasons, and for political reasons it lowers the barriers to campaigning for more restrictive measures leaking nto the rest of the standard.<p>1. <a href=""https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/encrypted-media/stack_overview.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/encrypted-med...</a>",1380882511

In contrast, the geological record contains long-term evidence for a variety of global environmental perturbations, including ocean acidification plus their associated biotic responses. We review events exhibiting evidence for elevated atmospheric CO2, global warming, and ocean acidification over the past ~300 million years of Earths history, some with contemporaneous extinction or evolutionary turnover among marine calcifiers. Although similarities exist, no past event perfectly parallels future projections in terms of disrupting the balance of ocean carbonate chemistrya consequence of the unprecedented rapidity of CO2 release currently taking place.</i>",1380882212

In the past, reduction of prices via higher efficiencies (= fewer jobs) has generally been a near-universal good: it freed up the workforce for other, more useful activities.  Nowadays, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any new segment of industry spurring lower-skilled job growth.  The flip side of prices getting lower is that job availability/quality goes down.<p>One could see France&#x27;s stand against higher efficiencies as, effectively, a form of monetary redistribution.  Perhaps the choice is between a society with low prices and a large underclass of un/under-employed, or higher prices and most people being able to make ends meet.

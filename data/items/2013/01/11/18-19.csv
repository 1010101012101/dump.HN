This was just as people were getting into the busy holiday season. He really can't come to any conclusions yet as 6 weeks there has not been enough time for people to write their reviews. He acknowledges this, but discards it, and concludes in essence that most people are thieves who obtained the book under false pretenses. In a year he could make that case, and even then it would only be reasonable if  he sent out a few reminders.<p>I am glad to see though that he did publish lists of the reviews he did find so that anyone whose review was overlooked has a chance to respond.<p>Unfortunately, his post there ruins the experiment.<p>I did not participate in the experiment but if I had and was about to go live with my review and then suddenly was publicly accused of being a thief, I would not go forward with an ordinary review publication since it would seem at that point to be trying to wiggle out of something. Instead I would write a blistering criticism of his methodology.<p>The claims and article are so shoddy in fact that it damages my opinion of his work overall.<p>I sometimes write book reviews on my blog. I don't accept free or discounted books, it's just books I've read. I have quite a backlog. Right now I have a stack of 30 books that I will read. Some of these I won't get to for a couple years. Not every one of them will merit a review. It's not reasonable for an author to expect amateur reviewers will get to their book within a few weeks of receiving it, especially when there is no stated deadline.<p>Additional thoughts:<p>* Reading further through the comments on his blog, in the first few comments I found 15 people who mention they are in the process of reading it, or who have not gotten to it yet but plan to. There were more; I just stopped counting at 15. There are no comments (among those first ones at least) from people gloating that they got away with an unwarranted discount. Several fulfill their obligation inline by posting their review thoughts right there in his blog.<p>* It should also be mentioned also that these days even hardcover books in modest quantity are very inexpensive to print when there's no color plates, so the $11 paid almost certainly ensured that money was not lost on the deal as far as printing and shipping costs goes.<p>* Deep down in the comments Scheiner responds to the comments and it seems he realizes he screwed up with his post and drastically underestimated the number of people who take a while to get around to and complete reading a book.",1357930536

The community has developed a few tool to track ""tainted"" money.<p>Also, you already trust an anonymous form of money: cash. Why so? Mostly because insurance exists against cash theft. As the Bitcoin ecosystem develops, eventually an insurance market will develop too. It sounds like Bitcoin is too unmature for you. So, wait. In this theft case, the exchange itself is providing this insurance to you: they guaranteed they will cover the stolen funds themselves.<p>Also, the beauty of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust an exchange like the one that was the victim of the theft. You can decide to take care of your own security by storing bitcoins on your own computer. There are a few efforts in progress to develop credit-card sized hardware wallet in order to provide extremely safe bitcoin wallets to non-technical users who are unable to, or don't know how to keep a computer secure for hosting a Bitcoin wallet.

The university has largely already been commoditized and that's a part of why it's so vulnerable to disruption.<p>Ah, but that's what I'm saying.  I would fully agree with industry not being the purpose of education iff the only people who went to universities had the financial means to not need to join industry afterwards, and our world didn't require highly educated people for something other than research and education.  It is unfortunate that the two are so incompatible at the moment, but I think they will adapt to each other in the next decade.<p>To address the initial point, I don't feel strongly about it but I don't think programming Android or iOS apps in college as part of a curriculum is a bad thing, even if it is tied to industry.

5044248,comment,5042991,5042991,1,0,zeidrich,,,"To me, failure is the the result of an action which causes stress.<p>That sounds wrong I guess, because you assume that you can have stressful situations where you succeed.  But more correctly I mean that when you make that internalized evaluation of whether you should do something or not, you look back on your experience doing that thing, and remember whether it caused you stress or if it made you motivated.  Even if the process is stressful, if the end result is more enjoyable than stressful, it's a success. Otherwise a failure.<p>Failure is a pretty key part of learning and building habits.  Things that you have attempted and failed are going to drum of feelings of stress and anxiety when you contemplate attempting them again.  Things that you have attempted and succeeded at are going to bring feelings of motivation when you think about doing them.<p>I don't know that changing what failure means to you affects a lot, but I definitely think that for me, understanding how stress plays into my willingness to continue trying to do something makes a big difference.  For instance, when you allow yourself to be really hard on yourself for an interstitial failure, (like making a schedule to work out 3 times a week and missing a day) it makes you feel a bit more stressed the next time you consider attempting it... it gets harder.  Eventually you decide it's too hard to keep trying if you're just going to fail, and you give up (often you attribute this to personal failings).  But if you want to get in the habit of going to the gym 3 times per week, the best way to do it is to go to the gym 3 times per week.  Missing a day shouldn't cause stress, nor should missing a month. You shouldn't feel ""failure"", because the ""success"" condition should be the results of going to the gym regularly, not some artificial construction of maintaining a schedule.  And in that respect, you're not failing, you're just not achieving that success condition as quickly as possible.<p>When you base your internalized feelings of success or failure around external constructs like that, you kind of undermine your actual learning and habit forming systems. Is your goal really to be fit? Because the goal you are really working towards is forcing a routine. The achievement of some abstract goal (checking off all the attendance boxes for an undefined length of time) instead of a more organic goal (actually feeling healthier).<p>I used the workout schedule as an example because it's an example where the end result makes you feel good on it's own.  But I think this idea can be used in business too.  Failure should be something you feel in situations that you want to avoid in the future, but you need to be careful not to feel too much failure for situations you want to improve.  If you associate the whole action as a failure, you'll just have more difficulty attempting it in the future, improving.<p>I have pretty good control over how I deal with stress, but I struggle with how to organize my priorities. The goal is to do my best and only let myself feel stress when it's absolutely necessary, or when I'm in a situation that if I fail, I should avoid trying it again.<p>Some people use stress to force themselves into action, because it's a strong motivator.  These people tend to dislike many things.  Failure comes frequently to them, and just the idea of failure causes stress and anxiety, which fuels them further.  It's one way to handle things, and I used to deal with things this way, but I think it's less healthy, and less controllable.<p>In conclusion, Failure is an abstract up condition made up to cause stress for not meeting an abstract goal.  They are methods we use to affect our internal decision and habit forming processes.  Success is an abstract reward for meeting a goal that may not have it's own intrinsically rewarding qualities.  Failure is an abstract stressor for not meeting that goal that may not have it's own intrinsically painful qualities. If we understand how we are, individually, affected by stress and reward, we can structure how and when we let ourselves feel failure to help stop demotivating us from our real objectives.<p>For me, rarely letting myself feel like I've failed has reduced my day to day stress, which makes it a lot easier to control myself emotionally.  That was a hard thing to let go of though. However, if I need to try to motivate myself, setting goals with a success condition and no failure condition seems to work better.  I started doing Judo a few months ago, the instructor had to leave town and I didn't jive with the new instructor as much, and I hurt myself and decided to stop going to the class.  Some people would feel like they failed by not following through with that.  If another class with a different instructor were to start up they might feel less inclined to sign up because they already tried to do that and failed.  But I only remember how I enjoyed the class, and would look forward to doing it again if I could enjoy it the same way.",1357930006

Cities are generally configured with zoning laws designed to preserve a certain standard of living for the larger community that extends beyond just a single apartment or building.  It helps to preserve the intended use of those properties for people that choose to buy in those neighborhoods.<p>For instance it gives property owners in a residential neighborhood an assurance that a neighboring building can't decide to convert their rooftop to a nightclub potentially disturbing the neighboring buildings with noise, foot-traffic, car traffic, drunks, trash, fights, etc.  If you gave individual landlords the right to make these decisions without wider oversight, you'd run into a lot more issues like these.  Sure - today they can petition to override existing zoning regulations and that sometimes happens, but residential issues are larger than just an individual apartment or building.",1357929235

5044119,comment,5042997,5043306,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is something I've been thinking about a bit lately, the difference between 'intent' to renege, vs 'just happened' to renege on a previous agreement. I had a manager once who well tell people in all earnestly that he was going to work to get them promoted, but when that didn't happen the question became did he lie? did he do the work and not succeed? Could he have even succeeded ? The person who stuck around waiting for the promotion feels completely let down and lied to, regardless.<p>So how do we make conditional commitments? Sometimes it annoys people when I won't answer yes or no to a commitment but instead say ""I'll do my best."" When pressed I can articulate the various uncertainties between now and the execution of the commitment that could derail it, but they are just that uncertain. Sometimes people say ""Just say yes, and if something comes up let me know."" I've done this in the past and had people accuse me of 'making excuses' which of course I feel is unfair :-).<p>There is certainly an element of 'value' here in that the consequence of not doing something has a cost and if the cost is small sometimes less effort is made in the follow through. If money is involved that is generally a more explicit definition of cost. But if someone says, ""Hey my son Jimmy is on the special team at this weekend's High School football game, can you come by and cheer him on?"" what is the cost of being unable to do that? Sometimes small (there are lots of people at the game) and sometimes large (this person really wanted to see you validate their support of their child's athletic activities) and sometimes in the middle.<p>Schneir positioned the transaction into the 'trust' category, you say you will do something and I trust that you will do it. The consequence of you not doing it is a loss of trust on my part. But the trust currency isn't previously established. Clearly my kids have a vested interest in keeping my trust level high because I can restrict access to the vehicles, but Bruce doesn't know me, and if he trusts me more or trusts me less do I care?

Unless you are on a laggy connection and up arrow delays and you push it twice and end up running the wrong command!<p>If you have lots of jitter and lag, i suggest using Mosh which I've found to be amazingly awesome when using it on Amtrak's spotty free wifi (3G uplink).",1357927307

That is, the private key is stored offline.<p>There is really no excuse for exchanges not using cold storage.",1357927276

Each <i>end-user</i> is granted a /64 network which has over 4 billion times the number of IPs than exist on the entire IPv4 internet.<p>Even with MAC-based IPv6 autoconfiguration to reduce the number of IPs you have to scan using tables of assigned vendor prefixes, you still have a truly massive number of IPs to scan before you find anyone.<p>Put another way, it would take over 500,000 years to just send an ICMPv6 packet to a /64 block (assuming you could even narrow it down to a /64 which itself seems just as unlikely) with a 1 Gbps connection (over ethernet).",1357927206

Banks are in the business of investing money which has been deposited with them.  As a result of (state and federal) legislation, banks are liable for making depositors whole in the event of theft, so they are motivated to invest significant sums in security.",1357927204

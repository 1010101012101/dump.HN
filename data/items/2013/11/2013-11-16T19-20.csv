6746215,comment,6726357,6739069,1,0,eeperson,,,"I guess I wasn&#x27;t clear in my previous question.  I know you can build a blocking interface our of a non-blocking one.  My question was how you go the other way.  How do you create a non-blocking interface of of a blocking one.  The parent post seemed to imply that Erlang was able to do this.  As far as I can tell this can&#x27;t actually be done.  If you have a blocking call you still have to block an OS thread somewhere.<p>If this can&#x27;t be done, then that brings me back to my previous point.  It seems like the important thing is that you have non-blocking IO and not that you have an M:N threading model in the runtime.  If you have non-blocking IO then it seems like you could easily implement an M:N threading model as a library without making it awkward to interact with.<p>Is there some assumption I&#x27;m making that doesn&#x27;t make sense?",1384631934

6746206,comment,6744708,6745000,4,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">(a) applications behaved well in the absence of permissions<p>As an app developer, I sympathize, but if you&#x27;ve got a reasonably complex app that requires 8 permissions, that&#x27;s 255 permutations of code paths that you need to test (that you don&#x27;t need to test right now) to make sure your app performs correctly. And that&#x27;s not a reasonable request to make of an app developer.<p>Aside from that, some apps rely on, e.g., INTERNET permission to do their monetization. Aside: It&#x27;s majorly not cool to &quot;block ads&quot; just because you don&#x27;t like ads; pay for the ad-free version if you don&#x27;t want to see ads. It&#x27;s cheap in almost all cases. It&#x27;s HARD to make money as an app developer; it may not be technically stealing to block ads, but it&#x27;s ethically indistinguishable.<p>That said, as an app developer I would <i>love</i> to have the ability to request OPTIONAL permissions, or even better, request them at runtime (basically, let the OS bring up a &quot;Do you want to let this app have PERMISSION_A, PERMISSION_B, and PERMISSION_C, to enable the following feature: FEATURE DESCRIPTION&quot;). Again, though, I&#x27;d want to request a SUITE of permissions at once, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about testing with random user-configured permutations of permissions.<p>There are some features I&#x27;d love to add, but they wouldn&#x27;t be needed by everyone -- and I wouldn&#x27;t want to scare people away from downloading my app, so I don&#x27;t add them at all.<p>But I absolutely would still want guaranteed permissions: If my app needs Internet to make money, then I don&#x27;t want someone to be able to use it if they&#x27;re blocking Internet for the app, or otherwise blocking ads on the phone. You don&#x27;t want the ads? You&#x27;re free to use another app, or pay to turn the ads off.",1384631764

6746202,comment,6744708,6745915,2,0,bostik,,,"> Many of the most popular utility apps ask for very intrusive permissions<p>At least that is getting rectified, little by little. Apparently 4.3 introduced a tool called &quot;Apps Ops&quot;, which brings some of the fine-grained permission control seen in Symbian (where it was actually possible to select which permissions to grant) to Android. [1]<p>Once the power users learn to make most of this tool, the app developers will have no choice but to learn to cope with their apps getting too onerous permissions yanked from under their feet. Which, to me, is a <i>very</i> good thing indeed. It gives the developers one more avenue to compete in - make your app too nosy and you risk getting sidelined by an upstart clone that behaves better with user privacy.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.phonearena.com/news/A-hidden-Android-4.3-feature-unearthed-Permissions-Manager_id45753"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonearena.com/news/A-hidden-Android-4.3-feature-...</a>",1384631725

A 4-5% failure rate, at the point of installation, would have been absolutely inconceivable in that job.<p>Sure, there were <i>lots</i> of failures, most caused by assembly errors, some caused by damage during assembly, some due to component failures, but the <i>vast</i> majority were caught before the trucks were loaded.  One guy with a rolling swivel chair and  several industrial-sized KVM switches can verify that 500 <i>(what you might expect for several computer labs across a single school district, for school districts the size we were dealing with)</i> or so PCs will more or less work in really just a few minutes.  I would assert that this sort of manual sanity checking is the sort of operation that is embarrassingly parallelizable too.  Two people can check a batch of 1000 just as fast as one person can check 500.  20 people should be able to do 10,000.<p>And this was a small operation.  Were we larger, it may have made sense to look into more automation.<p>Between those checks, and when they were hauled into schools and plugged in?

They naturally map it to one entity ; not because they are stupid but because the entity is interacting with them solely through that one identity and they don&#x27;t have incentives to care for the inner workings of that entity.<p>> It is also data driven hence they look at metrics that are considered success like registers over abandonments. Brand tarnish is a long term outcome, therefore it can not be seen in typical a/b testing cycles. Hence it is ignored, or even gamed upon for short term metric gain. This is true for all corps that equate success with short cycle data driven metrics.<p>Like: &quot;we don&#x27;t care about those abandonments because we got these phone numbers which are more valuable and show we are a trusty brand&quot; ?

But i am yet to see a commercial git repo which doesn&#x27;t maintain a central branch. The amount of confusion it puts an average developer into, specially if they are coming from subversion background does eat a lot of energy. I bet the person making the decision to switch to git, didn&#x27;t foresee that (i didn&#x27;t). Otherwise, you always would question if it is worth the trouble maintaining the project. Having said that, although there are countless benefits of git, but the one that truly makes it worthwhile in my scenario was the difference in merging capability.

It&#x27;s ambitious.<p>Meteor is not yet another nodeJS web-framework or client side JS framework. It also doesn&#x27;t stop at combining the both (with a beautiful DDP to share data between C/S). Meteor&#x27; s architecture will make it possible to use it&#x27;s components for all sorts of applications (other then the obvious web-apps).<p>2. It&#x27;s as easy or as complex as you want it to be.<p>You can write a meteor app in 4 files or in a complex packaged structure. No need to overcomplexify, if you dont&#x27;t want to. But you cán write large, complex, stable and maintainable code.<p>3. It embraces the eco-system.<p>You can rely on all of the NPM packages out there for your serverside logic and use all of the available frontend UI libraries and scripts. It will also enable writing complete reusable components in 1 package: servers-side logic, data-model, client-side logic, UI, ... all in one.<p>Biggest upcoming updates:<p>* Meteor UI.\nBetter approach then any other UI framework out there (including Facebook&#x27;s react or FTLab&#x27;s fruitmachine)<p>* Galaxy.\nDeploy and scale your app on your own infrastructure or in the cloud by pressing a few buttons.<p>To counter a few of the cons in this thread:<p>* It&#x27;s not reached 1.0 and it is therefor not production ready. I&#x27;d suggest writing your new applications in meteor anyway. Meteor matures quicker then any other framework out there. Is is well funded and here to stay.<p>* It is not scalable. Maybe not easy right now to make it scalable. But it certainly will be soon, when using mongodb oplog and galaxy will make it really easy to scale your service.<p>I run an agency in Belgium (redandivory.com) and we switched completely to meteor for all of our new projects.

Rows in the specialized, subclass, table would show up in the generalized, superclass, table (sans extra columns), but the subclass table would only show the relevant specialized type rows, with non-null columns where needed.

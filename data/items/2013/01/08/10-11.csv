The first specification, Touch Events, has been essentially abandoned.</i>[1]<p>> The mobile web is at this point not even usuable on a non-webkit browser. This is bad for the web. You are doing it. Please stop doing it.<p>There's no need to hector web developers about this. (I assume that's what you meant by 'you'.) It's mostly up to the browser makers to hash this out. Microsoft's contribution to Webkit was an exemplary and, from what I can see, much-welcomed response to Apple's patent shenanigans over Touch. Let's just give it time.<p>It's worth bearing in mind that Android (which ships Webkit by default) is currently the only mainstream mobile OS that even allows unrestricted use of independent browser technology, which is partly why Firefox Mobile is only available for that platform.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/microsoft-offers-patches-to-webkit-to-aid-touch-compatibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/micros...</a>",1357642747

We've been long past the point where raw CPU performance even matters for high-end games anymore, for some time already. Porting between e.g. PPC as used in consoles and x86 is business as usual, so I don't see why porting to ARM would be much more difficult.<p>The main problem right now is that ARM performance is simply not there yet. It might be somewhere in the future, but even that remains to be seen, it's not entirely clear how well ARM designs will keep scaling up as they start to approach midrange x86 chips.

5025641,comment,5025211,5025500,2,0,yk,,,"It is not possible, without some amount of luck. \nThe reason is, that you can think of the data + decompressor as a program which contains the data as some binary blob. There are less than 2^s different possible executables, where s is the filesize of the compressor together with the compressed data. And therefore 2^s different outputs. On the other hand, there are 2^l different original files (l is the filesize). Therefore only a few files can be compressed to a smaller file size. To be precise, you can compress at best 2^s files out of the 2^l ones by l-s bits.<p>Thinking a bit further, for a file of length l, the probability getting a file that can be compressed is smaller than<p>\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} 2^{-k}  [1]<p>which approaches 1 for l against infinity.

For example, you can generate a new address and use it to receive bitcoins without revealing anything about yourself at the time of payment, and without revealing to any third party that you were paid.<p>Making payments without leaking any information is much more difficult. You would have to pass your bitcoins through a third party which you trust not to reveal the link between deposits and withdrawals. If you don't fully trust any such service, you can pass through multiple independent ones. Even then, somebody could correlate deposits and withdrawals by their size and timing. There exist Mixer Services (<a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mixing_service"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mixing_service</a>) which are designed to make this difficult.",1357640970

In the past cross-platform game development was done as separate projects, often handing off ""porting"" the game to a platform to an external team, even. Today it's more common to use engines (such as the unreal engine) which support all the major platforms (PC, 360, and PS3 typically, for first-person, high graphic-load style games), and then do the development for all versions concurrently. Typically you'd just have your regular builds set up to produce versions for each platform as a matter of routine, and you'd have a consistent testing experience for each. You'd still end up with customizations and tweaks for each individual platform but for the most part all of the hard work of targeting and optimizing for each platform is automated.",1357640866

Some of the more interesting stories where he ""abuses the rules"":<p>* He bet that he could hit a golf ball a mile, ""as long as bounces and rolls are allowed...  flat ground of course""...  When the wager was accepted, he teed off at a frozen pond, where it wasn't that difficult to accomplish.<p>* Two variations on beating a champion at their own game:<p>- Slim played Minnesota Fats at pool, ""as long as I can provide the cue sticks""...  And then beat Fats when they both had to play with broomsticks instead of real pool cues.<p>- Slim bet that he could beat a very good ping pong player, ""as long as I get to pick the rackets""...  When the wager was accepted, Slim brought two identical cast iron skillets and let his opponent pick which ""racket"" he wanted.  Without having practiced, his opponent didn't stand a chance.\n-- Later, someone else approached Slim and wanted to do the same bet.  They had heard of the original bet, and had an Asian pingpong champion ""ringer"".  (It seems pitifully obvious to me that Slim wouldn't pull the same trick after the story was out, but apparently this gambler had his Asian ringer practice with a skillet and thought he would be ""safe"")...  For the second bet, Slim used ""standard"" Coca-Cola bottles, and won again.",1357640408

AIG was in a situation where the expectation was for it to go out of business because of its own (possibly illegal) mismanagement. It was offered a deal whose price, rather than being morally repugnant or open-ended, was merely expensive. And no one was going to die in any case. So let's try this:<p>You've decided to push a rather nice antique couch off the back of a high-flying plane for reasons all your own. While it falls, someone radios you and says, ""look, I'll snatch this couch out of the air with this really expensive-to-fly jet with grappling hooks I have, but afterwards you'll owe me 80% of what you make selling it or renting it to those weird antique museums"". Turns out the guy calling you really just wants to prevent the couch from crashing into a residential area, but he figures that in order to afford this crazy couch-saving stunt, he needs a big chunk of equity in the couch, which will be splinters if he doesn't save it anyway. And you, having decided that dropping a valuable piece of furniture from 30,000 feet was a bad idea after all, take the deal.<p>It turns out that you made a good move, because later you sell the couch and make lots of money, a lot of which goes to the crazy couch-saver guy. And you still think the deal sucks, so much so that, apparently, it was <i>illegal</i> for some reason, and you should get to keep a higher percentage of the couch's proceeds.<p>Now, what part of that seems like duress?",1357640406

Price, I haven't heard anything about.<p>As for advantages, it's probably the same as any other console, which means it comes with the same disadvantages. There will probably be steam box approved games on steam, which you will be sure will work in it, and you may also see some developers targeting it specifically.<p>But yes, if you know what you're doing, there probably wont be any advantage on choosing this over your own custom built PC.

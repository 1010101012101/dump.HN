If users can only up vote, the vote value is the same as the number of voters. But if users can also down vote, then the number of voters  is a missing information. The number of readers is also a missing information. <p>If v is the vote value and n is the number of voters, v/n is the score. It is a value between -100% and 100%. 1/n is the vote weight on the score. A big vote weight could motivate people to read and vote. Karma would also influence vote weight. <p>The number of readers is also a usefull feedback, a kind of popularity, and it should also somehow influence karma.<p>Adding the possibility to view news sorted by score, popularity and/or weight would give new perspective on the information.<p>Last year I wanted to create an electronic journal using this mechanism with other features I'll keep secret for now. I had to give up for various reasons, though I still believe it can work if it gets enough funding to prime the money pump. The name 'ejnl.com' is now to sell. ;-)",1178008513

1252398,comment,1251879,1252135,0,0,squee,,,"This is an intriguing comment, but I'm not sure it's valid in all cases. From my experience, getting up to feed a baby isn't something a woman does to fulfill her role - it's something she does to get sleep. I could not sleep if my baby was crying, or even just restless. My husband could. I could feed the baby; my husband could not. So I was the one who woke up to feed the baby. (Fortunately, feeding him put me right back to sleep, most of the time, due to the drowsiness-inducing effects of oxytocin.) I get the same kind of elevated mood from staying up all night programming or writing, not because it fulfills my role as I believe it to be - though it does, at least when it goes well - but because there is a physiological chain of events that leads to the mood elevation. I'm glad researchers are working on figuring out exactly what that chain of events is, because as a lifelong insomniac, it's a phenomenon I've noticed before, and I've often wished I could bottle it.",1270813507

Of course he's wrong.<p>Having said that, I don't think he's wrong on the big picture economics, more on the particular facts of the examples. It's about people wanting to ship binary drivers rather than just release the source so that others can fix it for you. Or generalize it so that your specific hardware widget is just one of many similar widgets all running the same basic code that can be mainained at a much lower cost (by any measure).<p>Of course hardware folks don't want to do that if they feel they have lock-in, for exactly the reasons discussed in this article.

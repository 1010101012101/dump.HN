And, from what Apple's been churning out, it seems to work.<p>I also recall hearing that Apple engineers didn't think the iMac was technically possible, and Jobs made them build it anyway.",1224228199

335390,comment,334457,335365,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Trying to move attention away from the ridiculous and nationalistic parts of your post to a part of it that was less so, isn't going to work. Take a look over your post again and I'm sure you'll see the portions of it that refer to.<p>The fact of the matter now is politics doesn't run on altruism. If you truly believe that there isn't an overwhelmingly large portion of your establishment doing their damn best to make sure the US stays the one and only true super power and that their reasons for doing this are not largely selfish, then you are lost, my friend. Call it ""stability"" if you like, but it doesn't change what it really is underneath. Need for control, the desired end product being alleviation of fear. I have a problem with anyone telling me they know what's best for me.<p>Smart people in the rest of the world try hard to make a distinction between the US government and the US people (especially at the moment), maybe you should start doing the same.",1224227462

335388,comment,332417,332507,0,0,petercooper,,,"> Apple wants to eat its cake and have it, if they can.<p>I'd say that makes Apple more like a Merecedes-Benz of the computer world than Porsche. Porsche produces extremely high end cars for under 1% of the market. Mercedes-Benz produces high quality ""prestige"" cars but still wants large market share.<p>Given that Jobs even drives a Merc, I think there's something to this comparison ;-)",1224227271

He either gets a part in a growing business, or, less likely, he gets to discover that a ""friend"" is not really a friend at all. Both valuable in their own ways.<p>All that said.. original poster, get everything formalized ASAP!",1224227097

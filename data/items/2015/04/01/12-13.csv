9303164,comment,9293310,9294649,0,0,mercurial,,,"> In terms of informal reasoning, the benefits of lack of internal (to a function) mutable state are essentially zero, or better worded, lack of local mutable state increases the complexity of a function. It&#x27;s not like your state doesn&#x27;t change if you use recursion and immutability... it certainly does, it just mutates transiently while you are building up your result. That&#x27;s often more difficult to reason about than a typical imperative solution with mutability.<p>But you can have local mutable state in OCaml using refs... In fact, that&#x27;s exactly how the gen library works (hide a ref in a closure). That said, I find it easier to understand a sequence of maps/folds/filters than figuring out what a for loop is supposed to represent.<p>> Okay, fine, perhaps I am a shit developer who simple isn&#x27;t smart enough or lacks the experience, but the reality is when you are working on a team, the chances are that you will have a very difficult time gathering 20, 30, or more solid functional developers let alone that many OCaml developers. Ideally, you want your team to all be at least competent in the language you are using and that&#x27;s harder to achieve with OCaml.<p>That&#x27;s a fair point. On the other hand, it&#x27;s very difficult to find good imperative programmers anyway, and I find that it&#x27;s more difficult to shoot yourself in the foot with OCaml.",1427893131

Another important approach is to understand what forces re-computations and re-renderings and try to minimize them when you can.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to serve non-reactive data (meteor-dumb-collections) and obviate many performance concerns related to reactivity.<p>The speed and relative ease of working with Meteor makes this approach well worth it to me.<p>Also worth noting is that many of the production apps built with Meteor are not billed as a &quot;real time solution to x&quot;.

9303088,comment,9297316,9297466,0,0,inthewoods,,,"Very interested in this - and thanks for the detailed write-up on your blog on how to execute the Netlify/Contentful setup. One question: a lot of pages I work on are of the format &quot;one big page&quot; where you&#x27;ve got all the content on one page, with some navigation element to get you up and down the page. Basically the pages are divided into &quot;bands&quot; or &quot;sections&quot;.<p>When I&#x27;ve tried to build these with static site generators (our current favorite is hexo but I&#x27;m going to look at roots), I&#x27;ve found that there isn&#x27;t a good way to separate out content. We end up with the content being stored in .JADE files which are definitely not content editor friendly. I haven&#x27;t found anyway to deal with this in a markdown file either. So we end up with a nice solution for the developers, but a poor solution for the content editor.<p>Do you have any approach to this using Contentful? Do you setup sections as individual entries, or is all the content for a page a single entry?<p>Lastly, how do clients feel about using Contentful? Is there any concern that they might go out of business? This is the common concern I hear with using anything other than Wordpress and would love to hear how you address it.",1427891851

9303085,comment,9302665,9302665,0,0,gedrap,,,"I use Firefox OS as main phone (ZTE Open C) since October, came with version 1.3.<p>The biggest disappointment is lack of applications. So you can&#x27;t get notifications for Facebook messages, etc. But that&#x27;s ok, given that the phone is in a very early stage and Facebook haven&#x27;t built a proper app for it yet.<p>There are some bugs which might be slightly annoying at first, but it&#x27;s ok once you get used to it. The most frustrating one is the text prediction when using the keyboard, because it doesn&#x27;t learn automatically and I am messaging in 2 languages... But I guess that can be counted as an edge case. The navigation (GPS) works surprisingly well though! Overall, it&#x27;s worth giving a try especially given it&#x27;s price.<p>I am quite excited about it&#x27;s future. The code is easy to read and should be relatively easy to add new features / modifications yourself. So even if it won&#x27;t become popular in mainstream (and it&#x27;s really hard to win user share in the current market), it can be an interesting platform for hacking.<p>I wrote a bit more about it at <a href=""http://blog.gedrap.me/blog/2014/10/19/a-month-of-using-firefox-os-as-the-main-phone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.gedrap.me/blog/2014/10/19/a-month-of-using-firef...</a>",1427891828

He will happily tell you that<p>a) Much of what he does is automatable and rather boring (takeoff, landing interesting; the rest very dull), and that it&#x27;s mostly punching settings into computers. Indeed, he does not have complete ability to do whatever he pleases - if, for example, he climbs too fast or steps outside flight parameters set by the airline (set mostly for cost issues), he would expect to be facing disciplinary action.<p>b) That a large amount of the training book-work that they have to go through is irrelevant for flying a modern airliner - but is in place mostly to act as a barrier to entry and to keep wages high.<p>c) That the biggest barrier to &#x27;self-flying planes&#x27; (which doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;autonomous&#x27;, it may be drone-style remote-control or other options) is the <i>perception</i> of safety.<p>It&#x27;s the last part that&#x27;s interesting. The Economist ran an article years ago (I can&#x27;t find a weblink sadly) about how a UPS cargo plane was flown entirely remotely on a test flight. It noted that humans seem to prefer the risk of a &quot;human being&quot; flying them around vs a &quot;computer&quot; - _Even If_ the data showed that the latter was much safer. It went on to point out that this might well be the case given the proportion of accidents classified as &quot;Controlled flight into terrain&quot; (I.E: the pilot crashed an airworthy plane into the ground).<p>It will be interesting to see if that public perception shifts given recent events.

9302976,comment,9302665,9302941,0,0,minot,,,"Here&#x27;s the text<p>Talking about Mozilla, the first thing that comes to mind is the Firefox Browser, powered with Gecko Engine, smooth rendering, and fast browsing capabilities. But that’s not all; Mozilla has been spending 15 years in developing what would perhaps become the next generation of smarter phones. Although not as prominent as Android OS or iOS, this would certainly let the ‘low-spec’ world touch the higher hierarchy of the mobile world. Unlike major mobile operating systems, which were designed based on Linux codes, Mozilla created their Firefox Os (project name: Boot to Gecko) on an HTML platform, more precisely HTML 5. Meaning; light weight and cheaper Smart Phones. Basing around HTML 5, Firefox intended to provide an alternative system to mobile devices, so that the applications used by users can directly communicate with the cellphone hardware. Despite aiming for low-budget handsets, Mozilla intends to compete directly with commercially developed operating systems such as Apple&#x27;s iOS, Google&#x27;s Android, Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Phone as well as other community-based open source systems such as Ubuntu Touch.<p>Considering the world of Internet, only one-third of the entire population has access to Internet or is online. This means that two-third of the world population cannot access to the world-wide-web, either because the connectivity is expensive or else the inability to afford a device that would ensure that accessibility. Even if Internet is made cheaper, the devices that support proper Internet activities aren’t going to be cheaper. And even if a device has been managed, the next issue that arises is the feasibility of a cheap handset towards web applications which are often resource consuming – in terms of available Storage and RAM. To bridge this gap it is essential for a system to exist that can cope up with low-end devices and has the capability to equally render web based features, keeping in mind that neither the Internet provider nor the device itself ask further investment from the user.<p>The idea that emerged was to bring web activities before the population that wouldn’t simply be able to afford smart phones, which lead Mozilla to design an OS that would bridge this gap, and hence targeting the low-spec devices. The OS and the applications used by the OS are entirely based on HTML 5 code, keeping the apps very small in size compared to their equivalence at Android or iOS stores, meaning lower data-transfer and hence cheaper maintenance.<p>Another good thing; since there are more HTML experienced work-force than there are for Linux or iOS, it is presumable that there could be greater collection of applications compared to Android store. Firefox OS’ unique feature to run web-based apps will provide openness that&#8217;s not present in the mobile-technology ecosystems where localized aspirations surround Android and iOS, especially. In those latter two environments, tight links binds the operating system, online services, app stores, and apps together, making it harder for people to use alternatives once they&#8217;ve lodged and invested. But with the iOS and the Android dominating the market today, programmers are lavishing resources on building apps that run natively in the platform instead of web versions that run everywhere. But a positive feature of the Firefox oriented apps is that, the applications being HTML5 and JavaScript based makes them a few KB in size. This ensures lower RAM usage and lower data cost. Besides, once you have downloaded the apps, these apps are readily available to all the devices you manage under the Firefox OS. A superior feature compared to synchronizing all the heavy application in the proprietary operating systems, and think of all the data and time they would consume.<p>Although the UI relates to Android and iOS to some extent, it differs in concept and purpose of the OS. The App screen specifically relates to iOS, user interactions and interface behaviors  are very similar to that of iOS. Even the ‘Home’ button operates the very same way; you click it, and any app you are running closes down and takes you to the app screen. You&#8217;ll also see the iOS-like scrollwheel interface for picking dates and time. Although Mozilla has their own browser that has its own fashion and interface, interestingly, the browser in the Firefox OS has a similar ‘Top Sites’ feature as in Safari. Perhaps, the Mozilla guys wanted their OS to be more of a replacement to iOS than Android. But the good news is, anyone who loves, or used, or wants to use an Apple iPhone, will find this in their dexterity and at much affordable rate. And yet, it doesn’t mean a total similarity, as I mentioned earlier, the interface relates to both iOS and Android – the notifications bar works like a cross between Android and the iOS7.<p>The one unique feature you could point is the Search Bar. Often in proprietary systems, swiping to the leftmost screen opens the search bar for your device, but in the Firefox OS the search bar opens for the Firefox App Store. And when you type ‘Youtube’, instead of bring the YouTube app, it also brings other apps that are related to YouTube or are linked to it. This is interesting especially when you want more info or want a drifted idea from what you are actually looking for. You can even save the search as ‘Smart Collection’ – one of their new features, so you can head back to your search list like clicking an app for search results.<p>To talk about the apps, these are not composed interfaces that bring everything from the site before you as in other major platforms. Instead, the apps directly link to the webpage, that is, since native apps in this OS are built on HTML5 and JavaScript, a well-designed mobile site will look and behave as if they are apps. This feature comes in handy when certain apps like Facebook and Skype do not portray the potentials as they do in desktop versions or even the mobile versions. Furthermore, why glitch your phone with an app that doesn’t provide any additional feature compared to its web-version? And Mozilla is adopting new web technologies that will enable the advanced features in Firefox OS, which will blur the distinction between a native app and a mobile site even further.<p>I must agree it isn’t well built and lacks a lot of user-friendliness in its design, only because we are accustomed to slick responses and tech-feel of the iOS and Android, besides Blackberry OS, Windows, and even the Symbian OS. But it is just beginning; they are constantly adding improvements and let’s hope the best would come from them.",1427890183

Did it mean sacrificing material for a mate, or a more standard development?<p>Most midgame analysis use the concepts of force, space, and time[1], and he didn&#x27;t even mention these terms, so I was left confused.<p>I am not sure what my level is, but pretty much all I did in my two years in prison was play chess, and in my relatively short stay, I became around the 5th best player &quot;on the yard&quot; and was able to play at the specific table where only the best players could play.<p>There were over 1500 inmates at the facility I was at, and at least half of them played chess as it was one of the only board games readily available, so playing at that table was no mean feat.<p>We would play for $1 a game and it became my &quot;hustle&quot; (a hustle in prison is something that allows you to make money doing something of value, like making some else&#x27;s rack (bed), or sneaking food out of the kitchen etc).<p>Anyway, I digress...I try to play at coffee shops when I can these days but I find often the existing players seem snobbish and its hard to find a game with the better players.<p>[1] <a href=""http://chessimprover.com/force-space-and-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chessimprover.com/force-space-and-time/</a>",1427889951

In any case, presumably you did not find something like Weebly a hard problem -- most programmers don't -- yet we're undeniably providing value to quite a few people: 1.5 million and counting.<p>You can't criticize someone for working on the needs of a large market, just because that large market doesn't happen to include you.",1237456649
523090,comment,522675,522897,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"The measure isn't whether something is <i>hard</i>, it's whether people will use it. It's great when that something is both.<p>There are tons of copy-cat websites because they are addressing huge markets with many different niches and until the demand curve is perfectly filled out, there will continue to be more of such sites. The most successful sites you see are as good as they are because people did use them and they gave feedback to make them better and fill in the holes -- they more often than not started out pretty bad. (check out YouTube: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20050428014715/http://www.youtube.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20050428014715/http://www.youtube...</a> )<p>I suggest taking your ideas and doing something with them. You'll find out that your ideas aren't so priceless after all. Fantasies made into reality are not necessarily solutions that work for other people. You have got to prove that your fantasies are really solutions, and repeatedly. You'll find out the sites that even bubble up to your attention have gone through many months/years of hard work and maintain themselves off some level of merit and integrity.<p>But even before that hard work, it takes time to develop skills and relationships that will prop you up when you need it. This is not just true on the web but in any profession. Your offline skills and the ability to communicate your ideas are extremely important and often overlooked by many programmers who aspire to be more than 9-5ers.",1237456492

This leaks a lot of information about the content even if the packets are encrypted, regardless of what encryption protocol is used. We strongly recommend that you avoid using VBR codecs if you want to make a secure phone call.<p><...><p>...This means that Skype is vulnerable to VBR leakage regardless of the quality of Skype's built-in crypto.""",1237456481

523075,comment,522307,522307,0,0,10ren,,,"He makes an interesting point that Google <i>hasn't</i> been a category-killer, in anything but search. Perhaps the most dangerous thing about them is the fear they create in you, <i>making you give up.</i><p><i>Did Google Video kill YouTube?</i><p>1. market win: YouTube's advantage there was mass adoption/network effects... which the article's SimulScribe doesn't seem to have yet.<p>2. tech win: I'm a bit leery of touting technological prowess, because through fast iteration anyone can catch up (especially if they have an example to work towards - tech history is full of these stories). The crucial exception is if the leading tech still isn't good enough. If that sounds counterintuitive, read it as ""has room for improvement"". Because as the new entrant catches up to where you were, you have moved ahead. The danger for you is if your product is already perfect - then you have no where to run!<p>The other way of protecting a tech advantage is through patents. The article doesn't mention patents, but perhaps that's because they create bad PR. People don't like patents. Some people <i>hate</i> patents. However, he's partnered with IBM, and he's talking about technical advantage in difficult field. If his tech really is that advanced, it's hard to believe he wouldn't have patents on it.<p>However, none of that matters, because he anticipates that the carriers' fear of google will drive them into his arms. He didn't say this, but an acquisition seems likely to me. If not by a carrier, then by google itself.",1237455912

I have a device on my desk right now called the CurrentCost that measures my home electricity usage. It's very popular amongst the HomeCamp home hacking community. It's very cheap, being given away free by two UK electricity suppliers.

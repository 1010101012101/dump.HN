The most recent change is roughly a month old and has actually made it more apparent that job postings are not regular stories.<p>From <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsnews.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsnews.html</a> :<p>""I've just released a new version that fixes much of the brokenness of the way job listings used to be handled. When I first added jobs, to save time I reused as much of the code for stories as possible. This worked well enough when HN was a small community, but it has been working less well now that HN has grown.<p>A lot of the newly arrived users seem not to have realized that job listings are the ads here-- that while they look like stories, they're not. The new code makes this more evident. Jobs no longer have points or submitters, and in fact the ranking algorithm for jobs is now completely different. Now instead of being ranked by points, jobs simply start at position 4 and slide down the page at 4 positions per hour. To prevent the frontpage from being overloaded with jobs, no one can post a new job when there is still one in the top half of the page.<p>I still have to make jobs persist longer on the jobs page. I may also have to add a job posting queue. For now it's first come first served.""",1308351392

2667409,comment,2666780,2667126,13,0,Dove,,,"All measurements in the real world come with error bars.  Indeed, at a certain scale the thing you're measuring generally becomes ill-defined.  The length of a piece of string to tenths of an inch is pretty easy to define.  If you magnify it so the end is rough, it's harder.  Zoom in to subatomic, and things get really difficult to define, let alone measure.<p>Given that any error bar contains some rational numbers, the case can be made that rationals are all you'll ever need for measurements in the real world.  Nothing can ever be measured so precisely that it has a definitively irrational length.<p>However, irrational numbers do serve as a useful abstraction when dealing with the real world, since one is often working in different scales.  A rational approximation of pi that works in one context -- say, construction paper projects -- might not be good enough in another -- say, orbital mechanics.  Identifying the abstract, transcendental value has the practical application that you can use a rational approximation appropriate to the scale.",1308351330

2667348,comment,2660436,2667072,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Fair point, I do get emotional.<p>I get angry with people who hijack legitimate scientific enquiries to manipulate others into doing their bidding. And I get frustrated with people who argue conjecture and theory as fact.<p>There is great science in climatology. Its fascinating and we learn new things every day. None of it suggests that any actions humans take will change the fact that the earth's climate is changing. Just like you can't simulatenously both believe in the science of evolution and that it no longer is a factor in humans.<p>So its scientific to say that our models show that CO2, as a green house gas, has a significant influence on climate. Its not scientific to say if humans make less CO2 the climate will stop changing. It is perfectly reasonable to say that if humans reduce their CO2 generation it will change the rate of change of CO2 in the atmosphere.<p>A great web site which focuses on the science is Skeptical Science [1]. I like it because they are pretty aggressive at seeking out all the journal articles and papers and seem to be pretty good about even talking about papers they don't agree with.<p>A recent article they posted talked about the PETM extinction event [2]. In that event, where there were no humans present, CO2 levels on the planet shot up, the planet warmed and lots of things died off. The study is great, the science is sound, and I'm sure the paper is cited often. Unfortunately nobody has yet figured out <i>why</i> the CO2 shot up.<p>So when you read this, on the one hand you can say ""Look it doesn't matter why, human activity is causing a similar jump in CO2 and it killed lots of stuff then we need to address this."" I don't disagree with that statement at all.<p>I disagree with the non-scientific statement ""if we address human CO2 generation this won't happen."" Is that a subtle difference? I don't think so. What ever caused CO2 to spike without human help could happen again, and if it does we're in a world of hurt. So people who approach this issue less emotionally talk about both changing how much CO2 (or any other green house gases) we liberate into the atmosphere <i>and</i> ways to survive climate changes. When people try to tell me that if I do what they say it will ""help stop climate change"" I get irritated with them.<p>[1] http:://skepticalscience.com/<p>[2] <a href=""http://skepticalscience.com/co2-rising-ten-times-faster-than-petm-extinction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skepticalscience.com/co2-rising-ten-times-faster-than...</a>",1308350182

The further development seems to require to ""shrink the die"" of our brain and/or increase/improving of the energy intake.<p>""Shrinking the die"" is biological evolutionary process that will take time on the scale of several generations at least (Einstein's brain, smaller, yet more densely packed and having more energy generating cells than the average human's brain, shows that it is a viable, in principle, option)<p>Wrt. improving of the energy intake - i think we're on the brink (ie. in the next few decades) of bio-engineering of the meat-comparable and, this is much more important, more effective-than-meat energy carrying and generating proteins (or whatever compounds it will result in) for human consumption, and in result - move of the humans past the meat (as meat eating would be an artificial dumbing down of yourself) and we'll see the world in the new light.

Your wage is simply the price of your labor. In the long-run, wages are flexible just like all of the other prices. Admittedly wolfram|alpha does not have extensive historical graphs available, but I am not trying to write a book here.<p>If you are down-voting because you have not received a pay increase lately, then you should be aware of the fact that wages are usually a bit more sticky than other prices in the short run.<p>If you are down-voting this, I would appreciate engaging you in honest discussion about the point that I made above.<p>The parent post said that inflation gives workers a little pay cut every year. Painting this wonderful image of a worker sliding into poverty. This is demonstrably false. Yes, a 1% or a 2% rise in inflation will impact your real earnings, but wages are not a static process and they do reflect the actual costs of living changes that take place over time.<p>As an economist, I am constantly amazed by how poorly the press discusses inflation and how little most people know about what inflation is and how it interacts with other variables within an economy.

Good security would take enough time and money to make the whole thing economically unviable.<p>Airport security in the US is poor because the policies are a series of politically convenient patches applied to a broken system.  In Israel, where the threat of terrorism is <i>far</i> greater, their airport security is both much more effective and much less invasive.  Why?  Because it was designed to work, from the ground up.  They don't hire legions of idiots at minimum wage or close to it to do their security.  They hire ex-military and ex-mossad people to surveil travellers.  They have highly-trained people who know how to spot potential terrorists, and multiple layers of security (usually just someone saying hi and engaging in light chatter) that catch the vast majority of problem people before they get anywhere close to an airplane.<p>The US system is expensive, invasive, and ineffective.  That doesn't mean airport security in general is doomed to fail, it means the US is incompetent at it.",1308348485

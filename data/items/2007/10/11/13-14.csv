The probability of a bad event is low, but the stake is very very high if it occurs : you have no law to protect yourself in the international zone, and international conventions are notoriously ignored in certain countries.\n2) is fleeing your country a really great thing at all if your life is not at stake ?\n3) is going where everybody goes to do what everybody does really smart ? Is being mainstream smart ?<p>But I know that this is not taking the easiest path nor is it doing <i>everything</i> I can do to reach success, since I would raise my success probability by simply moving to Bay Area.",1192111191

You don't have to be in Silicon Valley to write software.  Anyone in Duluth, MN can create software and load it on a server for users all over the world to use or purchase.<p>The market for numbers 2, 3 and 4 are geographically limited, however:<p>#2 and #4) The highest concentration of software companies in the  world is in Silicon Valley.  This in generally your market for #2 and #4.  Your chances of interaction with someone interested in buying your IP are much higher in SV than in Duluth.  Your chances of finding someone interested in paying top dollar to acquire a proven group of developers  increases exponentially in SV. <p>#3) Many companies are interested in purchasing large communities of users.  These tend to be located in large urban areas, however.  If I'm Chief Acquisitions Officer  (CAO) for BigMediaCo, and I'm interested in acquiring a startup that has a big community of users, it's not going to hurt if that company is based in Silicon Valley.  It adds to the CAO's prestige if he has to travel to silicon valley to acquire a startup.  <p>But, ask yourself this question:  How would that CAO feel about traveling to Duluth to talk about the acquisition?<p>Also, the value of a network increases exponentially with the number of users in the network.  In SV, it's hard to <i>avoid</i> networking with entrepreneurs and people in the software industry.  It's really not that large, and after you've been here for any length of time, there are no more than 2-4 degrees of separation between you and everybody else in the Valley, including people who want to fund you or acquire you.  <p>Case in point:  I've been here for 1 year, and I know for a fact that there are 3 degrees of separation between myself,  Guy Kawasaki and Woz, and 2 degrees of separation between 3 different VC's and me.  That would probably never happen in Duluth.<p>",1192111098
66247,comment,66165,66165,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So let's see, the question is whether or not you should spend two days doing _something_ to the code that will make your ownership of it easier to manage?<p>\nSounds like a no-brainer. Go for it. Of course, you'd better be sure you can really pull it off in a couple of days. Programmers are notorious for under-estimating these things. But in general, if you're going to be doing something for 2 months or more and you can do something up front that saves you ten percent or so -- do the math. Don't get into ""always rewrite"" or ""never rewrite""<p>\nIf you can recreate what they're doing that quickly, you're not that far along the development path anyway. There's a whole different answer if they've spent 3 months plugging away at it and already have paying customers. But it doesn't sound like you are there.",1192110863

66243,comment,66193,66193,0,0,amalcon,,,"Yeah, I'd noticed this a while ago.  It's actually pretty nice if you've told Firefox to ask you about cookies first.  I find that if the top site in the search results tries to set a cookie, it's often also one of those times that it's worth skipping to the second.<p>What's interesting about this is that it won't so much help spy on you (it won't), as tell people how effective their search engine optimization is (prefetch requests where referrer=Google mean you hit the top on something).  I would expect it would make it slightly <i>harder</i> (one more hoop) to spy on you, because getting the cookie does not necessarily imply that you clicked the link.",1192110348

Our next big challenge is to make the random people who have information our buyers are looking for comfortable when they come to the site.  These are generally folks with little or no net acumen that we've contacted out of the blue.  If making an uber sleek web 2.0 landing page is the way to make them comfortable, then we'll absolutely do that.  ",1192107858

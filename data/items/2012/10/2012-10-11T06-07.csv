Any test which aims to probe the limits of the simulation can, itself, be simulated at higher accuracy with only a slight loss of real-time speed.  In fact, it's highly likely that different parts of the universe are simulated with varying amounts of precision.<p>Heck, even if the simulators goofed, they can always fix the simulation, rewind the universe back to a prior checkpoint, and begin anew.",1349938690

Firstly this ascribes knowledge of the mind set of the emps. Secondly this ignores the fact that Zynga also was a ""safer"" firm given its history and at the time, certain prospects.<p>The employees for that firm which are hurting today aren't necessarily the same as your first batch or second batch hires in an untested startup.<p>(this is why I didn't comment - there are many ways to slice and dice this further, and suffer from badly drawn edges and subsets)<p>2) His description of it as startup lottery. The underlying philosophy here on HN, and in most places which discuss startups is strongly merit oriented.
His statement carried the implication that all the discussions so far were eye wash - it was a lottery and people lost, bad luck.<p>His later clarifications were pretty crucial to explain his context, but I can completely see where he ticked people off.",1349938624

4639792,comment,4638918,4638918,3,0,jineris,,,"As a feminist management theorist and geek, study conclusions like this always frustrate me.  Obviously, the study sheds little light on the actual cause of the correlation, but my guess based on my personal experiences with leadership strategy is this:<p>The choice to hire diversely is symptomatic of certain types of thinking:
1) Open / wide / flexible thinking.  Someone who hires diversely is more likely to find it easier to conceptualize worldviews farther from their own as still relevant.
2) Civic responsiblity / empathy.  A desire to be a part of the solution to gender imbalance rather than a part of the imbalance.
3) Long term thinking.  Having people who are more different from you on the team is a more effective solution in the long run, because you're likely to cover more bases.<p>This means that leaders who make the choice to hire diversely are more likely to also be leaders who plan slightly further ahead, are more dextrous in the different ways they could see problems, and able to focus on non-top-down perspectives on the business, such as what the customer might be thinking.  (All of this is correlative of course, not a->b.)  As a result, leaders who hire diversely are more likely to be already be leaders who are better at running a successful company.<p>Ie, diversity is a litmus, not a direct cause.<p>I would be very, very surprised to find if, someday when women run 50% of companies and are in workforce balance, companies with women executives are still more likely to be successful.<p>EDIT: I do, however, think there is also an edge to leadership that can sometimes come simply from being in a minority, whatever the minority is.  Not because there's anything wrong with white men, but simply because there's a unique perspective on problems and indirect causality that you get from being at a cultural disadvantage that, if you manage not to get weighed down by it, ends up being pretty useful in business.",1349938513

Don't be surprised if people come back in kind.<p>Now what you're now admitting is that your real prior isn't 50/50 or anything close.  You're starting from the assumption that it is incredibly unlikely that women can make much of a difference, and therefore you really do require extraordinary evidence before you'll even consider the <i>possibility</i> that hiring women could help.  In short your mind is so made up that your actual prior can fairly be described as fact resistant.<p>But is that a reasonable theory to have?  Independent estimates are that women make an estimated 85% of all consumer purchases.  If having women at the top of your company helps you figure out how to talk to that group, there is a clear potential connection between success and having women involved.<p>You don't like where this is leading?  Well try something a little less biased on for size.  If the vast majority of startups do not have women at a high level, but ability is equally divided between women and men, does that mean that startups with women involved early likely have an advantage getting better people?<p>I'm seeing lots of reasons to see that it could be <i>plausible</i> that having women involved early is beneficial for your startup.

You speak of 'learning from the whole thing' but clearly the GP post is complaining about that very same thing... that the author focused in on an idea and presented it without appearing to have learned of the wider context. Or if the author does know, he's not communicated that.<p>Someone with knowledge is likely to ask which school of Buddhism in attempt to understand the analogy. If Theravada, then does DROdio mean that his discipline is the equivalent of precepts that he his following?<p>In that sense self-discipline is just another word for practise and routine. An attempt to make an action second-nature.<p>The article also specifically says: ""Think of the self discipline of a Buddhist monk practicing monastic silence for years next time you're tempted to stray from prioritizing successfully.""<p>Buddhists rarely practise silence in the form of a vow of silence in the Western religious sense, this Buddhist saying expresses it better:<p><pre><code>   Do not speak, unless it improves on silence.

Observing that a Buddhist monk appears to have discipline and then repeating such behaviour without understanding why would be to cargo cult.<p>To go back to your last line again, 'picking out one little piece of a post to whine about instead of learning from the whole thing', I think it's precisely because most people on HN do want to learn about everything that we do pick things apart.

Actually, to be honest as I'm disgusted by the company for how they are handling things. Morale is in a slump and pressure from above to cut costs and increase profit is insane.<p>But to get back on topic: The policy this blogger has encountered deals with how a dealer must authenticate a customer before making any financially-impacting decisions or contractual obligations. As far as the lawyers are concerned this is to protect the company. If we mail out a new iPhone 5 and charge an account $100, then when it turns out you are not who you said that's simply too bad for us. We just lost an expensive phone. Arguably, it appears to make no sense in some scenarios like the one mentioned (where one could reasonably assume they are speaking to the correct person) but the reality is the person calling you has no bloody clue who you are. The account likely came up on their screen and the system dialed your number. You could be the account holder or a kid holding the phone.<p>The poor sucker calling you is likely sitting in a mile-long row of phones tethered to the desk by cords forced to listen to people complain all day long. Really, that's no different than just about every call centre. You asked for a manager... now guess what? You (if you're lucky) just got transferred to another call centre. Go figure.<p>Sales and service isn't all about money but that's all these big blind companies are able to see. You can complain about it all day long and it doesn't change a thing.

Like any earning occupation, landlording takes attention to detail, the ability not to procrastinate, and people skills.  Unlike most occupations, landlording will bring you into contact with some of the worst people the planet has to offer, under what has to be the worst possible set of circumstances.  If you <i>want</i> to lose your faith in humanity, I encourage you to take up landlording.<p>There are easier ways to live rent-free, unless, as I say, you have the personal skills to ride herd on grown children or if you are lucky enough to own your property in an area where normal people rent, and you can find good tenants on a regular basis.",1349936151

That means nobody can make him do anything and he has a very long time to get his house in order.<p>All they would have to do to make Wall Street happy now is lay-off a whole bunch of people and start making 20% profit.

Please don't get so worked up about sloppy posts and ""attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"" :-)<p>The 0.5 prior thing was an irrelevant use of the principle of indifference. What I really had in mind was a situation with the null hypothesis that having early women on board has no effect on the success rate of a startup whereas H_1 would be that they do have an effect. However, from my description I think what came out was a prior of the kind P(success | women).<p>Without using any terminology, intuitively the point I was trying to make (ineptly, as you point out) was this: the likelihood that I assign to the statement that ""having women early in a startup increases its succeed rate"" is very low, I need to see <i>many</i> cases, form startups working on diverse areas for me to update my likelihood value for this. Why? Because I don't think that a subset of population selected with no clear connection to success will affect the success of a startup. Clearly, if the selection has some obvious connection, e.g. coming from a highly educated family, being good in programming, etc. then it <i>will</i> affect success. It's just not clear to me how  being a female or black or gay or Indian, etc. has such a connection. I may, of course, be wrong.<p>And what about the irony of me calling the kettle black: I don't hold my HN posts to the same standard as research reports from a major company.",1349935623

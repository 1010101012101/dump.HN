Hardly anyone does it now, and relatively few have ever done it. Steve Yegge certainly hasn't""<p>For me, the point Steve makes is that the optimum is to build for yourself. The feedback loop is instant. That's where the best software gets written. When developers wake up at 3am with some idea for a feature that would make the software <i>they</i> want, work better.<p>If you're trying to write software for others, it's going to end up as mediocre and probably not entirely what they wanted.",1218549497

All those are much easier than space, and more useful.<p>Humanity hasn't had an outward frontier since the initial spread. The real frontier is technological and faces inward (Moore's law). The engineering solution is refactoring away the bloat of our bodies, when all we need is the minds. Become smaller, become faster, amplify intelligence, virtualize. This universe is cold, lifeless and slow - let's find a new universe in every atom, that's much more interesting.<p></wild-speculation>",1218548754

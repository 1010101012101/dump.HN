8171376,comment,8170318,8170318,3,0,monochromatic,,,"> The patent behind all these lawsuits is not particularly innovative. It claims something about sending notifications after an emergency phone call. Here’s the gist from one of the figures . . . .<p>This is a little disingenuous. You know the patent doesn&#x27;t cover the &quot;gist&quot; or any particular figure. It covers the claims (which you don&#x27;t mention at all, even in passing). And for some reason, you don&#x27;t even tell us what the patent number is so we can look at it for ourselves!<p>From a little googling, I suspect that we&#x27;re talking about Pat. No. 6,775,356. But why hide the ball and characterize the patent as &quot;not particularly innovative&quot; when you could just let people see it for themselves?<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US6775356.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.goog...</a>",1407902272

8171359,comment,8167130,8171234,3,0,whyenot,,,"> that needs HTML?<p>I think you are setting the bar a little too high. It seems to me like there is quite a bit of mail that benefits from HTML. Superscripts, subscripts, italics, bold and colored text (used in moderation), inline images (used in moderation) can be really useful when discussing concepts that aren&#x27;t easily reduced to characters.<p>Suppose your email would benefit from some mathematical formulas. You can do the old standby and drop into latex math mode, but the person on the other end of the email might not understand what you mean by<p>\\sum_{n=1}^k\\,\\frac{1}{n} \\;=\\; \\ln k + \\gamma + \\varepsilon_k < \\ln k + 1<p>much easier and clearer to use LaTeXiT or something similar and copy/paste in an inline image with the formula correctly formatted.<p>Or, say you are a taxonomist. Italics in species names are not just a stylistic choice, they also convey additional meaning. For example in<p><i>Epilobium ciliatum</i> Raf. subsp. <i>watsonii</i> (Barbey) Hoch & P.H. Raven f. <i>rosa</i><p>the italics show what parts of the full scientific name refer to the species and what parts refer to authors or levels of taxonomic organization (subspecies and form). You can&#x27;t do that with plain text (you could of course do it with markdown, though)...<p>plain text is sufficient of course; but sometimes the additional bells and whistles of HTML really are useful.",1407901574

MPK is very family-friendly, I&#x27;m sure you and your family will enjoy it.<p>I lived in Palo Alto in a 2BR/2BA apartment near El Camino and California. Not the most luxurious space, but it did me just fine. I was alone, so I Airbnb&#x27;d the 2nd room, earning about $2k a month. My rent was $2700, plus ~$100 for utilities and Internet. I made enough that the $2700 wasn&#x27;t a big deal if I had to eat the whole thing, but I was alone, so I optimized. MPK&#x27;s free food definitely helped me keep costs low too, but of course, that doesn&#x27;t quite help the rest of your family.<p>These are questions best answered by Peeps @ FB, but you&#x27;re not the first, and I&#x27;m sure they have plenty of resources to help you out.<p>All said and done, it&#x27;s definitely doable, but depending on your salary, it could be tight.

8171351,comment,8170283,8171285,3,0,bollockitis,,,"> You need to conserve that vital energy for sleep. My son is almost 15 months. I&#x27;ve been so long without sleep, that the rare occasion I get 8 hours or more I think my body just assumes I&#x27;m dead and starts breaking down.<p>I feel your pain. My daughter just turned 1. Up until a month ago, she was still waking up 3 or 4 times a night. Sometimes more. We had gone so long without regular sleep that my wife and I had gained over 30 pounds. We became irritable, tense, and we were getting ourselves noticed at work for poor performance and tardiness. And despite being happily married for nearly 15 years, our mariage was in jeopardy.<p>We decided it was time to try sleep training. We first tried a gentle, &quot;fewer tears&quot; method[1]. It sort of worked, but my daughter quickly regressed and became worse than before. Our presence stimulated her rather than soothed her, so staying in the room just made things worse. So, in desperation, we tried Jodi Mindell&#x27;s more old-fashioned method[2].<p>It worked. Beginning on night 3 of sleep training, we got 8 hours of unbroken, joyous sleep, and we have gotten regular sleep ever since. My daughter still wakes from time-to-time, but it&#x27;s no big deal now. We can put her back to sleep in a matter of minutes rather than the hours it used to take before.<p>The best part though is that my daughter is so much more rested as well. We didn&#x27;t realize that her poor sleep habits were taking such a toll on her. After a few days of good sleep, she began to smile and laugh more often. She began babbling like never before. She was less cranky, more patient, and her daytime naps even improved. It was like a damn miracle.<p>Anyway, long story short: take your own advice and prioritize your sleep. If you haven&#x27;t tried sleep training yet, do it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Lady%C2%AE%C2%92s-Good-Night-Tight/dp/1593155581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Lady%C2%AE%C2%92s-Good-Night-Tig...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Through-Night-Infants-Toddlers-ebook/dp/B000FC13TU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Through-Night-Infants-Toddler...</a>",1407901371

The important ratio is weight to volume.<p>Don&#x27;t forget crush resistance with a minimum of construction material. But as it turns out, a spherical shell is the optimal shape for all the stated requirements -- it evenly distributes the compressive force across its surface, it represents the optimal ratio of surface area to volume, and it therefore follows that a sphere represents the smallest mass per enclosed volume.<p>> But if you have a a structure from which you&#x27;ve removed the air that is too heavy to float in air you get no prize.<p>That&#x27;s certainly true. But for a vessel with a fixed wall thickness, making it larger greatly increases the chance that it will rise, because the enclosed volume increases so much faster than the surface area.<p>This would all be easier on Venus, where the atmospheric pressure is vastly greater than here, but the gravitational force is less.

8171336,comment,8169367,8171276,8,0,mehrdada,,,"I am well aware of the quality of the schools in Iran and can directly compare it US schools, having gone to school in both countries. That Newsweek article is not surprising to me, but in some areas it is inaccurate in my opinion. You do see high quality individuals graduating from Sharif university, which is highlighted in the article, but concluding the school itself is &quot;successful&quot; or competitive is incorrect.  The fact of the matter is that there is a nationwide exam to enter college level education for all schools and you basically choose your school (and major) based on your rank in that exam. In that society, engineering majors, specifically Electrical Engineering majors, tend to have high status, so if you do well, you end up going to study EE at Sharif University, probably not because you are a fan of EE or you think Sharif is any good: it just has to be better than other schools.<p>The outcome of this is simple: you&#x27;ll have selected top N individuals from an exam of half a million people and put them in a single school. Of course you&#x27;re going to see those people shine. That says _nothing_ about the absolute quality of what that school gives you, just how good it is relative to its peers in the country, and I define quality as &quot;output - input&quot;.  The &quot;input&quot; is high quality, but the delta is merely meh in my opinion. Also, the students are high quality--the faculty are generally not (unlike what&#x27;s mentioned in the article), but they do end up taking some credit.<p>In terms of the contribution of the country, I can just say that she is a survivor of an accident years ago, where seven talented math students died, whom had similar achievements to hers at the time.

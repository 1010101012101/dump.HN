From the link: ""Please be aware that an extension of time to file your return does not grant you any extension of time to pay your tax liability.""<p>It is possible to file an application for a payment plan with the IRS. IIRC, you can only do this once every 5 years or so; having done it anytime in the last five years disqualifies you from being eligible for a payment plan. You must also show that you can't actually afford the amount owed. You're able to choose your own payment plan -- $/month for N months -- but the longer you stretch it out, the uglier it gets, due to interest. If you default on the payment plan for any reason, there are some pretty serious fees and other interest added on (so said my CPA).<p>The big lesson for me here is that there is a 15% self-employment tax for sole proprietors and partnerships, and that it's assessed against your AGI, no matter how low your AGI is. I was confused about this and hadn't bothered to figure out my tax situation ahead of time because I was certain that my AGI would put me below the usual poverty line. But, there is no such thing for those that are self-employed. Oops.<p>I would have saved myself quite a bit of money if I'd taken care of this earlier last year, rather than waiting until the deadline was too near.",1270161995

  <% form_for do |f| %> still works with deprecation notices [YK]<p>* Add a new #mount method on the router that does not anchor the PATH_INFO
  at the end [YK & CL]<p>* Create a new LookupContext object that is responsible for performantly
  finding a template for a given pattern [JV]<p>* Removed relative_url_for in favor of respecting SCRIPT_NAME [YK & CL]<p>* Changed file streaming to use Rack::Sendfile middleware [YK]<p>* ActionDispatch::Request#content_type returns a String to be compatible with
  Rack::Request. Use #content_mime_type for the Mime::Type instance [YK]<p>* Updated Prototype to 1.6.1 and Scriptaculous to 1.8.3 [ML]<p>* Change the preferred way that URL helpers are included into a class[YK & CL]<p><pre><code>    # for all helpers including named routes

    Model.validators_on(:field)

Creative destruction is when an obsolete industry or practice is allowed to fail. Some people lose jobs, and find other ones later. It hurts.<p>Societal collapse is when we all starve to death because we are all critically dependent on modern industrial agriculture. It <i>kills</i>.<p>There's a difference. Preventing creative destruction is choosing to avoid pain now with death not-too-far-from-now. I am not being metaphorical. The article cites examples where just that happened; all those collapses were accompanied by carrying-capacity reductions, which is a rather dry technical way of saying ""lots of people died"".<p>A society full of people who don't get this distinction is a rather scary prospect, but alas, more people now than ever before get this and it's still probably nowhere near enough.<p>(Questions about whether our society is facing just such an inflection point right now left as an exercise for the reader, as well as what ""pain-avoidance"" measures are currently floating around that might qualify.)",1270160449

Somehow though, it seems like Apple's brand manages to get everyone on board, both consumer and developer.<p>I'm not being dismissive. Apple's brand seems like a great tool for moving the industry forward. Changing the way people use computers requires both consumers and developers to agree that this is a platform worth investing in, and Apple consistently pulls that off.<p>What other company could have convinced the entire industry that they needed to port some version of their product to a new proprietary platform?",1270160195

The closest parallel right now is an iPhone, of course, but this is much, much larger. I've been developing for it since the SDK became available and believe me, the size alone has extremely significant ramifications on design once you unlearn the ""old ways"" of thinking about application usability.<p>2) The iPad comes at this from the other angle: Why should I have to sit down at a desk or carefully balance a 5lb. machine on my lap just to check the weather and update my friends on Twitter?<p>3) It remains to be seen if the iPad will suffer the same fate. I personally doubt it will, but we can't know that yet. As for typing, most reviews I've read agree that portrait mode kind of sucks but they were all pleasantly surprised by landscape typing. I don't think Apple has ever claimed that touchscreen typing would be as fast or as nice as a real keyboard (indeed they even sell a physical keyboard iPad dock). This relates to #2 in that the iPad asks the question: How much typing should you <i>really</i> need to do for common computing tasks?<p>4) The controlled experience is what makes this all work, IMO. Without it, you'd have a mess. (See: all other software markets.) Apple still approves a lot of crap apps on the App Store that don't seem to ""get it,"" but at least they can't kill all the rest of my apps or ruin the overall experience. A lot of people seem to feel there's some kind of tyrannical evil purpose behind the App Store wall, but I think it's why the App Store has been such a success in the first place. (As annoying as it can be at times...)<p>5) Keep it away from kids?! Are you crazy? This form factor is, in all likelihood, the future. My 16mo son may grow up never owning a clunky desktop or laptop. My shiny MacBook Pro will feel like a dinosaur to him someday, I'm sure. Could it get broken? Sure. Could a laptop? You bet! What's the difference? Kids will be kids - buy insurance. :)",1270159941

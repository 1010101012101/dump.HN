Every time I want to access a DB, I have to do something to the effect of:<p>userDB.get(uid, function(err,doc){
  if(err){
    // log error
  }
  // Do something with doc
});<p>This is fine on a small scale, but as my app grows, it gets really hard to read the code. What if I have 5 DB queries? That is 5 levels of indentation, and a lot of extra code. I would imagine the above being written in Ruby + Rails as:<p>userData = Users.find(:uid => uid)<p>which results in no indentation, and is very easy to follow.<p>The most common solution I've heard to this is ""Well, just use named functions!"" This seems to produce even uglier code: because functions have to be declared <i>before</i> I can use them, I have to declare the business logic in reverse order. This means that I have to read code ""backwards"" to get the linear flow! And, in my experience, each named function does little more than execute a DB query.<p>It almost seems like this problem could be resolved with a little syntactic sugar:<p>userDB.get(uid) -> (err, res)

603081,comment,602307,602307,0,0,drawkbox,,,"I think this is a technology evolution natural move.  This will probably happen every few decades to the most capable new language or platform.<p>There is a strong religious backing to Scheme being the only way to teach core CS fundamentals at MIT.  I think that is an emotional almost fanboy reaction at times probably filled with heavy bias.<p>Python is a great balance of showing many sides of programming, it can be as eye opening as Lisp. Python is functional and object-oriented.  Python is a simplifying tool and culture.  All platforms used here should be simplifying.<p>Python can get you building market ready desktop applications, web applications, building robotics, scientific computing, game development, algorithms and AI and nearly anything out there Python is at the tip of the spear. Python is rapid iterations and prototype friendly.
The frameworks of Python are more capable to wrap nearly anything, that is what software engineering is about now. It is the same evolution software process has taken from the CMM, to CMMI (supporting modular and libraries), to Agile and a more natural iterative process rather than top down design everything from the bottom up approach.  You can still do that, it is just not the majority of software engineering today, and it will continue to simplify.<p>Are Scheme and Lisp programmers who are biased because they had that more hardcore bottom up technique really thinking this degrades the experience or is this more of a bias that is being attacked. Or has software engineering fundamentally changed?<p>Scheme will not go away.  This does not mean that people will stop making compilers or REPL.  It simply means the starting place is different. It might even drive some better compilers and multi-platform tools because of the quirkiness of many compiler systems out there will drive good engineeers to simplify that process.<p>That is what we do, we simplify problems.<p>I would argue Python makes for more marketable and capable graduates to be successful almost immediately after school, but I don't think it harms the fundamentals much. Good developers and engineers still take time to get better.  No one is the best programmer in college, it takes time and experiences after the academics to be highly skilled.   Python fits closely with computer science and is very capable of taking the torch.<p>I do think that there is a benefit to learning from a more difficult and core understanding because it is more downhill from there but Python is hardly the worst case scenario here.<p>I think that Python is perfect for teaching CS because of the flexibility, libraries, open source but support by Google (they are big on CS and like Python) and many other reasons.<p>What can you make in Scheme that you can't make in Python, very little.<p>Would you rather it be Java or C# they are teaching?",1242022768

Here's the actual text:<p>""Unfortunately, you can't tell the class of a C++ object given a pointer to it at run time. So if you debug a crashed C++ program and find a pointer somewhere in its guts, and you don't know its type, you'll have to guess that ""0000000600000005"" is a Point. Which is completely obvious, because that's the way a pair of adjacent integers looks like in hexadecimal memory listings of a little endian 32 bit machine. And two adjacent integers might be a Point. Or some other two-integer structure. Or a part of a three-integer-and-a-float structure. Or they might be two unrelated numbers which just happen to be adjacent.<p>Which is why you can't automatically collect the garbage of C++ programs.""<p>Which part are you claiming is wrong? (Be careful.) The entire first paragraph even Bjarne Stroustrup would agree with once he was done hemming and hawing. Post-mortem inference of types of dynamic objects in C++ programs is undecidable. In higher-level OO languages, memory is organized as framed objects, not as a bag of bytes. The main thrust of this questioned answer had nothing to do with GC.<p>And he's right about this being what makes GC and C++ bad fits for one another, too, though he skipped a few steps. Getting out the sock puppets, without the ability to tell the type of an in-memory object, you can't compact the heap. If you want to move an object, you can't just assume anything in memory with the bit pattern of that object's address is a pointer, because it might be two shorts or a double or whatever that happens to have that bit pattern.<p>While conservative, non-compacting garbage collectors can be built in theory, they're too slow in practice. Check out the source to Hans Boehm's C/C++ collector; it stops all the threads in the process, and analyzes liveness starting from each thread's CPU registers, each thread's entire stack, and the entire static data segment. By the implementors' own admission, this will not scale to large numbers of threads, or large address spaces. Even if this approach is refined significantly, if your garbage-collected program lives long enough, you <i>need</i> compacting garbage collection, or fragmentation will kill you just as surely as exhaustion would have.<p>And if you are so convinced that performant, general purpose GC can be dropped into large C++ codebases, you have a straightforward way of both shutting me up, and having a very interesting ycombinator startup. A drop-in operator new overload that does compacting, generational, safe GC would have a readymade market, with very deep pockets, from companies stuck maintaining enormous piles of C++ code with intractable memory management bugs.",1242022457

Any sane CS department would take these into account. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly apparent that in many cases MIT in general and course 6 in particular make decisions mostly because of popularity, marketability, buzz, or peer pressure. This is not how you innovate.<p>""Library use is relatively easy"" is not true for all cases; you are correct. 6.01 uses libraries which are well-built and relatively friendly. This is the first 6 class students take, after all. Classes later in the curriculum will have students using libraries of their own selection or writing compilers or operating systems for modern processors (should the student choose to take those courses). Between teaching fundamental concepts and teaching how to use a library, concepts should win out in introductory courses. Whatever skill it takes to use a library or documented system will be learned in time.<p>I don't <i>absolutely</i> know the answer to whether Caltech would do something similar but I would wager a great deal that they wouldn't.

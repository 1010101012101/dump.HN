The other for the worse.<p>FWIW, one is full of theoretical fluff from someone who earns through selling books and tapes.  Do what he says and you make actually take your focus OFF the ball.  The other is about the best of us who have achieved remarkable things.  Now which one do you really want to read?<p>(As far as habits are concerned, I just changed ONE HABIT to be more like some guy named Wozniak.  This changed my entire thinking about my project and has made all the difference.  I would name the habit something like ""Loading all of the details about one thing into my head's main memory at the same time"".  Reread Chapter 3 to see what I'm talking about.)",1202993191

I'm working with PaySimple now and the service has been pretty nice, but it was a lot of paperwork and hassle, and now the effort in using the API..<p>I just looked at ClickBank.  <a href=""http://www.clickbank.com/recurring_billing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clickbank.com/recurring_billing.html</a><p>They were the defacto standard of people selling ebooks, but now they look like they have a recurring option.  Their commission is higher I'm sure than a merchant account + gateway, and you have to use their credit card form, but it's probably the easiest to setup and lowest setup fees.",1202992069

I was very relieved when I found someone else did.<p>You admit a few of these mundane questions are 'kind of interesting'.

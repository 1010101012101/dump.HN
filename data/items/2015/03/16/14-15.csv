Chances are that most of the great programmers you ever meet followed a sensible schedule, slept well at night, didn&#x27;t disassemble any electronic device in their childhood to see how it worked and lived a pretty average middle class life without any huge sacrifice required to achieve success.<p>Chances are you won&#x27;t read about that because it would make for pretty boring stories. Regular, progressive learning doesn&#x27;t sound as cool as caffeine fueled 4-day programming sprees.<p>Then again, people with a truly passionate temperament exist, which is usually great to have around and brighten the mood, but doesn&#x27;t tell much about actual programming skills.",1426517969

At the time, I agreed to allow recurring billing (though I don&#x27;t consciously remember doing this).  After a few years of seeing the recurring charge on my bank statement, I called to get a debit card with a new number.  They sent me a new card with the same number (but new expirey).  After discovering a fresh charge in the next yearly cycle, I called my bank to &quot;contest&quot; the charges.  They asked if I had talked to them (the vendor, Yahoo in this case) or otherwise explicitly cancelled my &quot;subscription&quot; and told them I had no way of recovering my account information and wasn&#x27;t about to navigate their phone-based customer service.  My bank did absolutely nothing to help me.  Moving forward, I&#x27;ve sought to minimize any form of accounts following this paradigm.

It seems to me that much of OS X&#x27;s hidden and non-obvious functionality is just there to satisfy someone&#x27;s incorrect definition of what would be functional for the end user.<p>> The Windows equivalents of these things are just dead icons.<p>That&#x27;s incorrect. Based on your own example - Chrome and IE both have progress bars in download icons. The value of being able to transfer an in-progress download to another machine seems highly questionable to me and I seriously doubt that anyone would need such functionality on a regular basis. But, I rest assured knowing that whatever I need Windows to do, I can make it do whereas Apple typically locks down the APIs that one might need to do something different than the &quot;Apple way&quot;.<p>And I think that having the entire UI update immediately after checking a box is really stupid because I cannot cancel all of my changes at once. But that&#x27;s the Apple way - remove all functionality and claim that it&#x27;s somehow a superior product. It&#x27;s also a useless workflow for changes that might not be undoable, so it cannot be employed everywhere and now the end user has to deal with multiple workflows. Meanwhile -  OK, Cancel and Apply present the full spectrum of functionality in a consistent and logical way that is not hidden from the user.",1426517831

While it is possible to successfully raise a child in a one-parent family it is a difficult variable; there is a reason why the news includes single parent as a hardship in their tales. Locating child-care, staying home with a kid who is sick and cannot attend day care, one income wages, and a host of other variables create issues for allocating the one-on-one time necessary to develop the ABC&#x27;s, numbers, and mannerisms that a two-parent family is capable of; be they gay, straight, black, white, asiatic, hispanic.<p>The question is how can we, as a society, encourage two-parent families, so we can get people a good start to be successful?<p>On the website, there are societal factors within Japan that are creating suicidal individuals without any hope for the future:<p>* Salary careers are no longer as optimum as before, Mr. Tadayuki is taking the same action as those of second born individuals from centuries past, seeking opportunities in other lands. Staying in Japan only creates suicidal thoughts.<p>* Hostess girls fall into the same trap as strippers, there is so much up front monies to be made that pursuing a career seems dubious for those who are not able to see long term benefits or have requirements that necessitate large up-front monies (drug habits).

Video gives your landing page and company instant credibility. It is also a medium of communication people are comfortable with. This greatly increases your sign up conversion rate. I put together a list of some great startup explainer videos I really like and some different things I took away from them.<p><i>Robin Hood</i> - “Free stock trading” -  https://vimeo.com/87163777 - It always helps when you’ve got Adam from Sandwich video on the job. The anticipation and confidence is strikingly similar to DollarShaveClub. This resulted in 300k prelaunch emails.<p><i>VidFall</i> - “Videos play, prices fall”   https://vimeo.com/84588387 - Example of a great animated video. This is how you do it on a budget. Professional voice over is a MUST!<p><i>Notabli</i> - “Your Child’s Greatest Moments” - https://vimeo.com/119583565 - You don’t need a voiceover. Your job is simply to inspire. Use images and music that hits home and is relatable.<p><i>Dollar Shave Club</i> - “Great shave for a fraction of the price” - https://vimeo.com/37974974 - We’ve all seen it, but come one… it is genius. You have to take risks.. plain and simple.<p>Other takeaways:\n- Always use your Vimeo link. There won’t be a pre-roll advertisement. \n- Try to avoid the future tense (Our company will XYZ…). You’ll want this video to last a long time. \n- Strike an emotion and take risks. A simple explainer video/powtunes video kills a little piece of me each time I open one.\n- Sometimes professionals like Sandwich video will take equity in your company to create your video. It could be the exposure you need to succeed. Go for it!<p>Would love to hear what you guys think makes a great pre-launch video. Or if you have any other great examples.

The developer workflow is a bit different than that of GitHub/GitLab but it&#x27;s nothing that should hinder development. Primarily it revolves around using a client-side command/utility called &#x27;arcanist&#x27; in order to submit code for reviews. The largest difficulty is working with feature branches which is a newer concept at my company.<p>I have it working with LDAP + ssh access (a la GitHub, everyone uses the &#x27;git&#x27; account to push but uses their own keypair for authentication). The review system works quite well, and one thing that I hadn&#x27;t seen in other systems is the ability to &quot;squash&quot; revisions -> while the code is being reviewed and updated, once it&#x27;s finally &#x27;landed&#x27; into the repository all the diffs can be squished to a single commit rather than having multiple commits correcting eachother. One of the nicer things about running Phabricator is that it has quite a bit of documentation, and<p>I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with Phabricator, and the bright people working on it are always helpful in the IRC.<p>The largest gripe I have with Phabricator is the UI is a little tedious at times (multiple page navigations for doing some things which feel like it could be simpler, etc.).<p>You can create yourself an account on their hosted version, and browse their development of Phabricator: <a href=""https://secure.phabricator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.phabricator.com/</a><p>Edit:\nOne other thing I wanted to point out which Phabricator does that GitHub/GitLab and others do not appear to - Phabricator starts to form a model around &quot;Ownership&quot; of code which has been useful on a large project.

While it&#x27;s a reasonable observation about housing politics, it does invite potentially false equivalence.  A kind of equivalence is built into the term itself - &quot;not in my backyard&quot; means everyone recognizes something is needed, but nobody wants it near them.  In this case, everyone wants to live in the low density section of a high density area.<p>Still, this term encompasses everyone from bernal heights hippies who want to keep density at 18,311/sq mi to atherton billionaires who want to keep it at 1,400.  It includes noe valley &quot;activists&quot; who don&#x27;t want to tear down 100 year old houses and mountain view city council members who voted to allow massive new corporate construction bringing tens (hundreds?) of thousands of new workers to their region but specifically banned new residential construction near those places of business.<p>All in all, yeah, I hear you on the noe/bernal/mission activists.  They are a bit nimbytastic, no doubt.

Buttons on each info box to remove individual listings, or favorite / star. Perhaps some of my own comments. Slowly iterate iterate until I get a list of 4 or 5 that look most promising. If possible, allow overlaying with custom maps, or at least have info about transit (nightbus can be a requirement for some, subway for others).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even mind seeding some of the data, if I had to.

And this weekend, I finally achieved the Python gold badge (my area of focus). It was hard to get, took a long time, and I benefited from strong English skills and research skills as well as my Python and programming skills.<p>I mentioned it to my boss this morning, also a technical type, he told me that and $3 would buy me a cup of coffee.

You need all the essential syscalls to do something sensible and if any of the required parts doesn&#x27;t work the whole thing fails.<p>So start with something simpler. Start by making a kernel that can run /bin/true, that never reclaims memory, that only boots on whichever VM you&#x27;re using for testing. You absolutely can start with a kernel that&#x27;s simple enough to write in a week, maybe even a day or hour, and work up from there. See <a href=""http://www.hokstad.com/compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hokstad.com/compiler</a> for a good example of doing something in small pieces that you might think had to be written all at once before you could test any of it.<p>> I spent the past 3 weeks doing exactly that, refactoring a code base. I knew exactly where I wanted to go, but eventually it meant working for about a week on code without being able to compile, not even think of testing it, because everything was moving around and getting reorganized. However now I&#x27;m enjoying the fruits of that week; a much cleaner codebase, easier to work with and I even managed to eliminate some Voodoo code nobody knew why it was there, except that it made things work and things broke if you touched it.<p>Which is great until you put it back together and it doesn&#x27;t work. Then what do you do? I&#x27;ve watched literally this happen at a previous job, and been called in to help fix it. It was a painful and terrifying experience that I never want to go through again.<p>In my experience with a little more thought you can do these things while keeping it working at the intermediate stage.

Tellingly, his whole essay is focused on &quot;passion&quot; == &quot;time expenditure wasted&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s another type of &quot;passion&quot; where it&#x27;s equal to &quot;extreme interest in subject matter&quot; or &quot;pursuit of intellectual puzzles&quot;.<p>Since the author uses &quot;passion&quot; as &quot;time wasted&quot;, his view of programming comes off as a white-collar version of bricklayer.  Don&#x27;t lay any more bricks and cement than is necessary for the construction foreman.  Punch in the clock at 9am.  Punch out promptly at 5pm.  It&#x27;s all about <i>time</i>.<p>See the relevant phrase excerpts:<p>> put in a solid eight hours<p>> spending twelve to sixteen hours a day in the office<p>> forsake everything else to spend more time coding as a badge of honor.<p>> programmers who spend all their waking hours on the job<p>> working several weeks of twelve-to-fourteen hour days with \nonly Sundays off<p>> spend all night on the job<p>> Put in a solid eight hour day, and then get the hell out. G<p>>, once you have worked a solid eight hour day, leave the office and silence your phone<p>>, and ignore your bosses when they bitch about you only working nine-to-five.<p>Being driven like a slave for 12 to 16 hour days is a legitimate gripe but harping on the word &quot;passion&quot; (or the fact that his superiors label it as &quot;passion&quot;) is blaming the wrong thing.<p>I concede that there are many enterprise companies who need trying to recruit &quot;passionate&quot; programmers to maintain boring CRUD apps.  Sure, a lot of these programming jobs are soul-crushing bricklaying work.  Their use of &quot;passion&quot; is self-serving and rightfully triggers a jaded reaction.<p>However, a lot of startups need &quot;passionate&quot; programmers who genuinly <i>enjoy</i> algorithms, solving graphs, etc that are relevant to the companies unique technical challenges.  Yes, even this type of &quot;passionate&quot; programmer will tend to spend  more than 8 hours on the job.  It&#x27;s because they <i>like</i> the work they do.  Jony Ive at Apple spends 12 hours at work because he&#x27;s <i>passionate</i> and not because he&#x27;s being chastised by Tim Cook.  (Jony Ive is already a multi-millionaire and can quit if he feels he&#x27;s being exploited.)

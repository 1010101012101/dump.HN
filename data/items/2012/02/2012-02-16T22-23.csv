I've found that their nameservers often have a rather high latency, peaking up to 300ms at times. They are the cheapest hosting I know, and for a good reason it seems, but I don't mind paying a couple euros per year extra for better service.
If I were to switch registrar though, I guess I'll need to buy the domain again? I have 3 years left at Versio, but I'm not really happy about their service... When doing a whois lookup it claims to be registered only till next year, but apparently they automatically renew it.<p>- Can anyone recommend me a registrar, preferably in the Netherlands or otherwise Europe, with good nameservers? 
- Will I need to buy the domain again after transferring it, or might they have a special price if I only need DNS while the domain is registered already?
- Is it possible to only use the nameservers of another ISP while not transferring the domain itself? (Incase moving it turns out to be rather expensive.)<p>Why I don't ask this all at Versio? I don't expect them to recommend me any other registrars, and their support sucks (I didn't think I'd need it when choosing for this registrar). They give incomplete answers, and they often simply don't know the answer. So I'd appreciate if anyone here could help :)<p>Thanks a lot!

There also currently is no info to users that their data will be centrally stored by chute in the app GUI, I am no lawyer but after the recent privacy backlashes it might be a good idea to add a note regarding this.
From my point of view, as things stand today with the current focus on privacy, such a feature would need to be completely device based or at least on the servers of the developer of the particular app itself. In another comment a little further down it was also hinted that the chute API might get a price tag at some point (with a free tier), these two things combined unfortunately make it unusable for me at this point.<p>Really love the idea though, hope we get to see a purely device based version of this at some point (by chute or somebody else).",1329429678

These seem to be the most prevalent:<p>Visio/Omnigraffle - you can export to a pdf or a selection of images & hack out a click through from there.<p>Balsamiq with this: \nhttp://eclecticguy.com/2008/11/06/assembling-demos-from-balsamiq-mockups/\nwhile waiting for this: \nhttp://getsatisfaction.com/balsamiq/topics/help_me_design_the_linking_mockups_feature<p>Axure RP:\nhttp://www.axure.com/<p>I've used previous versions of Axure and while it was initially thrilling (hitting that sweet spot in between handcoding a click through & having the project features of a Visio-type program) I found the undesirable tendency for the tool to influence the designs. I'll be testing the latest version & if anyone is interesting i can let you know how that compares to the mix.<p>Adobe InDesign / Powerpoint - granted, this is the strangest method i know - but it can be rather effective used to build an (internally) linked document.  Too bad every other part of that experience is clunky.<p>Beyond those above, there's always the code it from scratch and/or use a WYSIWYG approach.  There's also paper and/or index cards - but for now I'm limiting the field to digital options.<p>My ideal tool of course gives me complete control to present the ideas quickly while not requiring me to get so far into their domain specific language that I lose perspective on the actual problem at hand.  This seems to be the biggest danger with the 'from scratch' approach as you can of course to all sorts of wonderful things in an html clickthrough that have nothing to do with the work at hand. At the other end of the spectrum, though, a pdf presentation is quite quick - but not very interactive & subsequently not great for user testing.<p>Any secret (or not so secret) weapons out there?

I think that outsourcing their problems to the community is their best chance at meeting their objectives.<p>But gee, guys, at least <i>give</i> them a mission that they can succeed or fail at. Even if the moon was a bad idea, the process of trying to acheive that mission hopefully would drive out more innovations in manned spaceflight. Putting off the easier smaller goal in favor of a longer-away more vague goal is total idiocy from an organizational standpoint. We know this from our technology projects and startups. Give them something they can achieve in little pieces. Make them focus on results instead of process. Keep an eye on a vision, any vision, and get the organization able to execute around that vision. Public, simple, clear visions are best. Long complicated diagrams and 35-year plans are total bullshit.<p>This is just another nail in their coffin.<p>I'm really disappointed hearing this.",1241179905

Martin Fowler clearly defines the issues at stake as well as possible cultural (generational, geographical) that could affect how people perceive the slides and the community's reaction.  Martin also gives thoughtful responses to common statements made regarding this issue.<p>The two most helpful insights in the article are ""The crucial point is: do we want to create an environment where 'thin-skinned' people aren't welcome?"" and ""I can't choose whether someone is offended by my actions. I can choose whether I care.""<p>So far I haven't seen those ideas related elsewhere, and I would like to know y'all's thoughts on them.",1241179442
588371,comment,587610,587610,0,0,ggruschow,,,"Is the issue really commercial DBs? It seems like most projects that use a (SQL) DB are solving a problem they shouldn't have, and doing it in an overly complicated manner.<p>If a project truly requires ACID to the point there's a sensible worry about the disk holding the right data, I'm pretty sure I'd save money (and hair) paying for a medium server and a license to deal with that (particular) data. It's really rare to run into a problem that requires both that level of reliability <i>and</i> needs performance beyond what a medium server can reasonably handle. I think most projects are far far more likely to screw the data in some other way, so one could question if it's worthwhile.<p>I'm saying this having had to implement true ACID transactions (and replication) myself. It's a ton of work getting it right through all of the layers of libraries, os, filesystems, controllers, and drives. It's hard to trust user-level programs to be able to do it given an arbitrary stack below them. I place more trust in a system that can cut through some of those layers (or call across campus and control how some of those layers work) and work with particular hardware.<p>I place even more trust in someone screwing the data up at a higher level and it really not mattering nearly as much as people make it out to anyway. Even in ""critical"" cases like storing financial transactions, it usually just results in people having to call around or get in and fixing a few things.. which is WAY cheaper than the huge cost to lower the odds by 90%, and you've got to be prepared to do that anyway.",1241179408

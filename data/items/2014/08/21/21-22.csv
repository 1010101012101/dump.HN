8209863,comment,8209180,8209180,2,0,csandreasen,,,"Though I&#x27;ve advocated for more metrics-based accountability in the past and agree with the author on that level, I don&#x27;t know that tying a profit incentive is necessarily a good thing.  It encourages people to vote for which policy is more profitable, which may or may not equate to which policy is more effective.  If the goal was, for example, to reduce crime rate, it would be more profitable for me to vote for the Sheriff who&#x27;s slightly more likely to fail but simultaneously more likely to cook the books than the one who has a 50/50 shot of actually decreasing the crime rate.<p>What if the policy in question is a rather difficult problem where all solutions are equally likely to fail?  Would that discourage everyone to vote on that policy except for those who are already wealthy enough to make a risky investment?<p>Stepping back further, this would likely discourage anyone who didn&#x27;t have sufficient disposable income to vote, thus making policy more lopsided.  If I lose my job, how do I vote on establishing/expanding a safety net when I have to worry about feeding my family?  If I can&#x27;t vote, does that effectively mean that welfare and similar programs will be voted out by those that have no use for it?",1408658351

So I guess my point is, you may be selected even if you are not ideal for one side or the other just because of the rules of the dance of voir dire and random luck of the draw (I was the last one seated, if they had avoided on passing one less person I would have walked out on day 1).<p>The trial ended up being about cold therapy devices and a guy who was suing a local corporation saying the device caused problems in his knee.  I was initially surprised the defense (who still had passes) kept me around because in the original juror questioning I&#x27;m sure I came off as the liberal/borderline-anti-corporate-socialist lefty that I am.<p>In any case, the defense did a really good job of rationally showing that the device didn&#x27;t cause the harm and the harm was the result of medical malpractice from the actual doctor; but the plaintiffs had a way more charismatic law team and almost won the case; in the end it was a mistrial with me and a few others holding out for the defense, plaintiffs would have won with one more vote (since it was civil it wasn&#x27;t required to be unanimous);  3 days of very painful deliberation, trying to calmly explain to others on the jury how badly they misinterpreted the testimony and evidence and how they were manipulated by the plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys (but, you know, not saying it outright like that).<p>The whole experience was actually pretty interesting though 6 weeks was at least 5 weeks too long.

But this is where I get confused about the payouts.  The predictions have to be tied to reality in some way to have any value.  So the backers of a given policy choice have a financial incentive to see it exceed predictions, while the opposition has incentive to see it fail completely.<p>They could game the metric to avoid paying out as much, and do something like pass out pot brownies to kids in day care.

You&#x27;re running a ton of tests, yet I see no mention of how you&#x27;re adjusting your tests to account for multiple testing. The more tests you run the higher the chance you have of getting a false positive. Couple this with the majority of things you test probably won&#x27;t be significantly better, and your chance of encountering a false positive is much much higher than you might think. You&#x27;re running hundreds of tests and using a p-value of 0.05, but your chances of a false positive in your tests is much much much higher than 5%. Beware multiple tests and especially beware of the base rate fallacy.<p>2. Your post has no mention of statistical power or the size of the effect you&#x27;re looking to detect. That makes me think you might not have considered this.

I got called again a couple years later where I was working independently on my own software projects, where if I didn&#x27;t ship, I didn&#x27;t get paid.<p>I took the obvious rational choice of using every trick in the book to successfully get out of it both times.  The alternative would be a potentially unbounded chunk of my time gone, and that much farther behind on my goals.  Large companies can get a kind of diversification, but I&#x27;m sure jury duty hits small companies hard as well.<p>The system is broken.  I get the need for civilian juries, but the cost should be more fairly distributed by encouraging jurors to show up by paying jurors a reasonable wage rather than the pittance of a couple dollars a day that is currently paid in most jurisdictions, and at the same time, let people opt out by just saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to&quot; without having to give a reason (or better yet, opt in instead).  We&#x27;d raise wage high enough to get some target percentage (like, say, 50%) of called citizens motivated enough to show up, or possibly compensate jurors pro rata based off of 120% of their average declared income on the previous 2-3 years of tax returns.<p>We&#x27;d have to raise taxes by a small amount to cover these payouts, but that&#x27;s completely reasonable as we&#x27;re shifting the burden from randomly chosen individuals of whom unreasonable demands are made today to a more broad and even and shallow tax base.  It&#x27;s the same reason we pay road work crews a wage rather than randomly selecting every week who cleans the roads.  And if we pay enough to still get 50% of jurors showing up completely volitionally, we&#x27;d still avoid the problem of &quot;professional jurors&quot; who would try to game the system by serving on many juries.",1408657225

It&#x27;s not &quot;20 times less lines&quot; so much as it is &quot;20 times clearer expression&quot;. Not that it&#x27;s exactly 20x, but it seems better. When you express things more clearly, and structure your code more like your problem, and less like your programming language, you shed a lot of accidental complexity ( See Out of the Tarpit - <a href=""http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf</a> ), so managing the complexity of your project is easier, which means fixing bugs and adding new features is also easier. I think this is the route being implied when they say you can develop features faster.

Then wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to argue in favor of this new system?<p>My point is that even though there are widely accepted <i>moral</i> arguments for why &quot;one vote per person&quot; is the best way to organize society, it really boils down to an <i>economic</i> argument about what the actual results of such a society will be. I suspect few people would support &quot;one vote per person&quot; on moral grounds if they believed that another system would result in a society where everyone is better off.

For instance, a tiny coin-cell battery can have a significant impact on the flying ability of a small insect (we targeted dragonflies).

I&#x27;d love to get back into &#x27;insect cyborg&#x27; work.<p>EDIT: And after looking a bit more, it seems that the actual paper describes the surgical process for implanting the electrodes such that the rebuilding of the moths tissue actually makes them be a part of the moth.

Some investors would never see themselves as gamblers but are. Some are over-cautious and moralistic about their investing.<p>Similarly, while there are frivolous lawsuits, and lawsuits that are technically not frivolous but are very harmful, like patent trolls and SLAPPs, there are also domains where personal liability does not reach today, like police violence, that could benefit from bonded practitioners with their bond at stake.<p>No matter, the plaintiff thinks I&#x27;m too establishment.

I think overall it helps adoption if you have layers that are not completely foreign to the implementing developers.

I&#x27;ve recently received some bids for a small job involving heavy machinery, and -- at least in this area -- suspect that owning your own business in that &quot;boring&quot; market provides a more reliable source of revenue with a better quality of life than 95% of HN readers who work in cubicles at tech companies.<p>Owner A is a fellow who owns a bay area company that does grading work. He built his own house in the Woodside flatlands, where land costs tend to run in the millions of dollars, and the construction cost including permits of building a new house may be $2M-$3M alone. Neighbors include Larry Ellison and the Steve Jobs ex-Jackling estate. It&#x27;s true he&#x27;s driving around a lot for bids, but many folks would prefer that to staring at a screen. It&#x27;s probably psychologically and physically healthier as well.<p>Owner B is a fellow who owns a bay area company that does excavation and sewer work. He owns a house in Portola Valley (another affluent community, for instance home to VC Vinod Khosla, who hosted Obama recently) and a second home in the Sierra foothills. Has a stable of Porsches and eight motorcycles. Is a pillar of the community, and sends his crew out to open roads closed by storms or downed trees when the town or fire department can&#x27;t get to them quickly enough.<p>They may miss out on the upsides of billion-dollar IPOs, but a precious small percentage of startup founders or employees will get those anyway, especially post-Sarbanes-Oxley.

8209588,comment,8206038,8209033,4,0,dragonwriter,,,"> SBCL also uses static linking. It doesn&#x27;t recompile every ASDF imported library whenever I compile my application.  It just does so when it is actually necessary. Why doesn&#x27;t it work so easily in Haskell?<p>It does; in fact, in GHC -- the dominant Haskell implementation -- at least, its even easier: it doesn&#x27;t recompile installed packages <i>period</i>. Packages are precompiled, and are merely linked when you compile an application that they depend on.<p>Aside from it being <i>factually incorrect</i>, I&#x27;m not sure why this is even relevant to the discussion here -- &quot;dependency hell&quot; doesn&#x27;t come from recompiling libraries when you recompile applications, it comes from conflicts between version requirements for dependencies among packages installed in a single repository (which is why sandboxing is a tool for addressing it.) It manifests when you try to install a package with dependency conflicts with another app, not when you try to compile an app that depends on the conflicting packages.<p>> I think it&#x27;s the strong type system because every small code change can break the whole fragile structure of a Haskell application.<p>I think before you try to explain <i>why</i> something happens, you should first be sure that the thing you are describing <i>actually happens</i>.<p>> Could that be the reason why there are (AFAIK) so many hackage projects aged or even unmaintained?<p>I suspect the reason is the same that there are so many Ruby Gems in the main repos that are aged or even unmaintained (and I&#x27;d be surprised if this was different in any similar package database that wasn&#x27;t actively culled of non-current projects -- which would have its own downside) -- the repository system is, by design, low cost to enter, so lots of things that have no strong demand or lasting commitment get posted to it.",1408655039

It should be capable of categorizing tweets about an event as headline(MJ's dead), more info at(latimes.com), comments.<p>In short it should search twitter for real news and display it in a traditional blog style. Perhaps, it could even display excerpts from the info source site.
The comments display should be real time so that you can in effect discuss the news with totally random people without having to follow them or anything.<p>A killer feature would be an up/down voting system, so that any noise in the news items gets immediately voted out.
Btw killer domain name. Perhaps use ""What's tweetin now?"" as a tag line.<p>EDIT: Why it would be valuable: Ask Jeff Goldblum :P ( <a href=""http://technologizer.com/2009/06/25/twitter-the-fastest-way-to-get-informed-or-misinformed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technologizer.com/2009/06/25/twitter-the-fastest-way-...</a> )<p>EDIT2: You could also add a user rating system like the one at stackoverflow, in order to get the bots out and give more weightage to more popular users.",1246186600

It explains what we're looking at.<p>As the grandparent explains, this article has no context in the title (""[unspellable] website launched""), and no context in the target site.  It's just a black hole (or rather a grey hole, given the site's look and feel).  I made it back here without any idea what it was or why I had been sent there.<p>The grandparent's assessment was completely correct and delivered constructively.  It should not have been voted down.",1246184912

It may be a fun exercise, or a nightmare, but either way it'll be something different for a little while.<p>Submit your ideas and vote the best ones up to the top. Once a field of ideas has been established and I think a winner emerges I shall start a marathon session until completion.<p>Challenge me with wild ideas, or suggest simple tools to improve upon whatever already exists.. but whatever it is, explain why it would be valuable to you and others.<p>I'm open to the idea of giving the person who submits the winning idea a stake in the project, but as I'm in the UK it may be difficult to do so formally. Feel free to discuss whatever you think would be appropriate and I'll do my best to come up with something fair to reward your creativity.<p>Let's be tweetin!",1246183748

I just can't find any common ground from which to empathize with anything he has yet written.  He's somewhat well known, is he not?  Is all of his writing like this?",1246183690

Here are some salacious examples to titivate you, but we're not going to tell you anything about what it actually does, how it works, or cases where it didn't find anything.<p>As with most of these sorts of items I'm left hanging, no better off because I knew these sorts of tools existed, and worse off because I've wasted 5 minutes trying to find some detail or content.",1246183501

Most concurrent/distributed systems in Erlang are built on OTP, the set of libraries built on those primitives, which has it&#x27;s own set of higher level tools and abstractions (supervisors, gen_servers, FSMs) that provide a lot of the failsafes and profiling built-in. Basic Actor concurrency is simple in principle (but like most things in distributed computing) extremely hairy in practice, and OTP&#x27;s libraries and templates take care of almost all of it (a reasonable analogy might be naked C++ vs. C++ with the standard libraries and Boost -- you CAN implement your own raw pointer-mungling data structures, but almost nobody does).",1372809046

If you have a treadmill that that is just frustrating and inaccurate you will also stop.<p>But as soon as a new mode of input is good enougth, people have fun doing things with these input modes even if there is a more efficent way to input. People play with controllers even if it is clear that a shooter can be played better with a mouse.

I&#x27;ve been fine with Apple&#x27;s &quot;Walled Garden&quot; App Store approach, because I do believe it offers consumers an amount of safety when buying apps.<p>Anecdotally, I tell friends and family who are new to their iPhone (or Mac, iPad), that they don&#x27;t need anti-virus, certainly not on their iPhone. They don&#x27;t need to worry about downloading bad apps from the App Store, Apple doesn&#x27;t let anything bad in (Android has a history of malware in its app store). It&#x27;s what they <i>expect</i> from owning an Apple device.<p>I really don&#x27;t want to have to start telling them, &quot;Careful, you could be downloading a fake app&quot; anytime soon. I believe Apple should work harder to stop apps like these from getting into the store - it&#x27;s much better for developers and consumers.",1372807354

I think I understand your frustration, but I&#x27;m not clear on the solution.<p>> ...take the old Windows taskbar...place it on the left...Add typical application-tab-management features to the taskbar...then most people won&#x27;t need application-tabs.<p>I think that I have this with Windows (7/8/2012) and 7+ Taskbar Tweaker.<p>I can separate all my app windows and each will show up in my taskbar. I can drag/drop reorder them without them getting grouped up (via 7+). I can close each taskbar item with a middle-click of my mouse button or right-click menu just like in Chrome. The ability to do all of this tanks to 7+ is indeed liberating. (However, I still need tabs for browser and code windows.)<p>Based on the quoted text above, it seems like you&#x27;re suggesting that we just go back to individual windows (i.e. no tabbed document interfaces in any app). Let&#x27;s call that Idea X. But then you say:<p>> ...application-tabs are easier to use than windows. Their drawback is that they silo tabs from different applications away from each other. Let&#x27;s break that restriction.<p>Reading the last two sentences I thought...what you&#x27;re suggesting is that a single window could contain tabs from separate apps. That way you could group windows A and C together when you need to. Is that correct? I was imagining Chrome where each tab could be a different app&#x27;s window and they could all just be grouped however you want. (This is Idea Y.)<p>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re suggesting - I don&#x27;t know - it could be nice (if done well...in a way that meets everyone&#x27;s needs), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to solve your described scenario. You&#x27;d have to group all of your app-window-tabs ahead of time and that&#x27;s as much work as you&#x27;re doing now.<p>Did you suggest Idea X, Y, both or did I miss something?",1372806744

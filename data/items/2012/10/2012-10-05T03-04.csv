4615616,comment,4612996,4614948,3,0,Ogre,,,"The DRY ideal in this case would be more about describing the relationship only once, and having that relationship then propagate everywhere it needs to, most especially to the foreign keys in your database schema.<p>Sometimes, reaching that ideal is not practical and in the name of pragmatism a programmer will indeed repeat themselves.  But that repetition is where the trouble starts.  If you have to describe a relationship twice, then sooner or later someone is going to forget to update one place or the other.  As a database guy, you would like them to always remember to update the place that tells the database about that relationship.  But in reality, it may be just as likely that someone will update the model and forget to update the database.<p>The idea with DRY is that you should try very hard to find a way to represent the relationship only once so that mistakes can't happen, but that doesn't mean sacrificing the integrity of your data to do so.<p>That said, I know little about Rails, and perhaps it's hard to do it right, or at least easy to do it wrong.",1349409420

In the real world, database normalization isn't automatically the right answer, and there can be valid reasons for repeating yourself.<p>Then again, there can be valid reasons for repeating yourself when writing code as well. Personally, I prefer ""don't repeat yourself without a clear reason for doing so"", which is a very different guideline.",1349409404

Antidepressants can block or reverse these neuronal deficits, although typical antidepressants have limited efficacy and delayed response times of weeks to months. A notable recent discovery shows that ketamine, a N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, produces rapid (within hours) antidepressant responses in patients who are resistant to typical antidepressants. Basic studies show that ketamine rapidly induces synaptogenesis and reverses the synaptic deficits caused by chronic stress. These findings highlight the central importance of homeostatic control of mood circuit connections and form the basis of a synaptogenic hypothesis of depression and treatment response.</i>",1349409159

Utterly and completely.<p>I don't know if Jeff has read ""Getting Things Done"" By David Allen. Or he has read ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. With Regards GTD, David Allen specifically mentions its very easy to get on and off GTD framework. Because GTD does require a level discipline to get it work. Or any Time management framework ever invented for that matter.<p>If to-do lists are not working for you, then you have one of the signs.<p>1. You don't have a lot of things to do in your daily schedule at the first place. Making the purpose of list obsolete.<p>2. You have very few but large monolithic tasks that don't need to be written down, and generally fit in comfortably into your brain cache.<p>3. You are not frequently interrupted.<p>4. You don't procrastinate.<p>5. You are just not disciplined to follow the list discipline.<p>>>Eventually I realized that the problem wasn't me. All my to-do lists started out as innocuous tools to assist me in my life, but slowly transformed, each and every time, into thankless, soul-draining exercises in reductionism.<p>Sorry to-do lists do work. Don't make to-do lists a religious ritual you need to follow. They are there for a reason and if you fit into that framework its futile to use it.<p>>>Lists give the illusion of progress.<p>When were lists meant to measure progress? They are meant to track your work, your brain only has a limited capacity to store things. When you put to many to-do tasks in your brain, you start to worry about it. And then most of your energy goes into worrying than executing those tasks.<p>The whole purpose of lists is to dump your brain on paper. Then execute them, if you are interrupted you know where to start after you get back. In other words they work like stacks in software.<p>>>Lists give the illusion of accomplishment.<p>Lists of completed Lists are definitely an <i>indication</i> of accomplishment.<p>>>Lists make you feel guilty for not achieving these things.<p>That is why they work in most cases.<p>>>Lists make you feel guilty for continually delaying certain items.
Lists make you feel guilty for not doing things you don't want to be doing anyway.<p>Why do you put them on the list anyway. Lists are not books used to maintain vision statements. They are tools to put <i>actionable items</i> whose progress you can measure.<p>>>Lists make you prioritize the wrong things.<p>Lists are dumb. You create them. How can they make you prioritize wrong things.<p>The problem is over zealousness. As I said before a list is not your vision statement.<p>Write things in the list what you want to do. Not what you dream about, or want to have 10 years from now.<p>David Allen covers this in his book, These sort of things should ideally go in a 10 year plan or whatever year plan and its progress must be reviewed every Saturday or so.<p>>>Lists are inefficient. (Think of what you could be doing with all the time you spend maintaining your lists!)<p>Think of what you could not be doing if you didn't know the time needed on what you have been doing, doing currently or likely to do in the future. How will you know where you could save time and use it elsewhere?<p>>>Lists suck the enjoyment out of activities, making most things feel like an obligation.<p>This is true if you work at a resort. But if you are somebody who has to 5-6 meetings, go for status updates, answer 20 emails, solve two bugs, tend to your home and track your personal projects all in a day. Without getting organized you are not going to make it.<p>>>Lists don't actually make you more organized long term.<p>Because you stop just there. You don't have a list of lists.<p>>>Lists can close you off to spontaneity and exploration of things you didn't plan for. (Let's face it, it's impossible to really plan some things in life.)<p>That is why you should run your life like an agile project and not in the waterfall model.<p>>>If you can't wake up every day and, using your 100% original equipment God-given organic brain, come up with the three most important things you need to do that day<p>Most people don't have 3-most important things in life.<p>In fact lists exists because most don't have 3-most important things in life.",1349408895

Basically, you need to do as much as possible on the client side, even when packets are not going through, to make the interface feel responsive.<p>The issue might also be exacerbated by a simple lack of bandwidth, or maybe some problem with HTML5 (I admit, I am not that familiar with HTML5 as a dev environment.)<p><a href=""http://bombermine.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bombermine.ru</a>, on the other hand, was as smooth as butter for me.

This problem is exacerbated when you say:<p>> I disagree that increasing ""exponentially""... is always faster ... Both versions have the same worst-case running time<p>Worst case, sure, but how do you compute average? You could take a selection of n number of integers from 0 to infinity and the number of guesses until you found the correct answer, but of course you can't do this because you can't easily get a random number to test with that is between 0 and infinity. That said, it is fairly clear that x * x is faster than 2x is faster than x+1, but you can only prove this to be true once you pick an arbitrary limit less than infinity -- and the benefits of the better algorithm are only evident as you approach infinity.<p>Seems like a catch 22.

Asimov used the analogy of a gas: an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, but can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy. (Physicists know this as the Kinetic theory.) Asimov applied this concept to the population of his fictional Galactic Empire, which numbered a quintillion. The character responsible for the science's creation, Hari Seldon, established two axioms:<p>1. that the population whose behaviour was modeled should be sufficiently large
2. that the population should remain in ignorance of the results of the application of psychohistorical analyses </i><p>I believe we are already laying the ""foundation for this study. Look at the market. The foundation of the market is us - our consumption (which I believe is ultimately unsustainable - but that's another discussion). At it's core, that's what the market is all about. Right now I suspect Goldman (and the other investment houses) have stopped trying to <i>predict</i> the market. They are trying to <i>control</i> the market. Which leads to many of the problems we have now.<p>Without accurate data, predictions, you can't completely control risk. So risk remains.<p>Anyway to answer your question; I just repeated the theory of Asimov and argued why I thought the theories of  psychohistory were already in practice. Which of course they <i>were</i>, since everyone <i>was</i> trying to predict the course of the market; which meant predicting the course of the herd. So if you studied people (all of the people), you could win in the market.<p>But much of the market has changed in the last 20 years.

I think a certain amount of humility is called for when making claims about how someone ELSE could improve his or her productivity.<p>For example, in my own practice (and contrary to the above), a to-do list has the most value to me precisely for things that I'd like to do someday, and not things I need to do now. This is because I need the list for things that tend to float out of short-term memory. I don't need it for immediate or high-priority tasks, because I tend not to forget those. People are different.<p>It's absolutely a fine thing to say, ""This practice improved my productivity. I offer it to you, for your evaluation, in case you find it helpful, too."" But even if 95% of workers are more productive with practice X, maybe I am a member of the 5% minority that is more productive with practice Y. It is silly to assume that given various ways of approaching a problem, there is ONE way that will better for 100% of people .<p>Being a professional means I own the responsibility for deciding how to accomplish something. Sometimes a group needs to reach a consensus on how to do something, e.g., pick one source code control system, rather than letting each programmer pick whichever they think makes them individually most productive. But choosing a personal to-do list is personal decison.",1349406131

Somehow you're expected to build things with that.<p>For those that love to build things from the ground up or to carve out new solutions, Node is a great place to be. I think it's got enormous potential and is biggest opportunity since Python and Ruby took off around years ago.<p>Just don't think because you can create the same sorts of apps with Node that it's as easy.<p>Ruby on Rails even three years ago was laughable compared to today's toolset. Node is catching up quickly, covering ground faster than Ruby ever did, but still lagging.",1349406099

</code></pre>
Why not? I wouldn't have thought startups are limited only to webapps/software? We're building from the ground up?<p><pre><code>  It doesn't really have a huge scaling potential does it? 
</code></pre>
Why not? You don't think Pixar (800+ employees) and Dreamworks (1400+ employees) started out as large companies did you?<p>In fact, to further illustrate my point, I'll actually give you a rough timeline on how Disney started.<p><pre><code>  1923 - Walt Disney animating on own, formed company with brother in August of that year
  1924 - Joined by Ub Iwerks and others from Kansas city
  1925 - Company size grows to 12
  1929 - Sound comes in, steamboat willie released
  1930 - Staff increased to 30
  1932 - More than 100 employees
  1934 - More than 200 employees, Work on first film starts (snow white)
  1935 - more than 400 employees
  1937 - more than 800 employees
  1939 - more than 1000 employees
</code></pre>
So by 1939, they had only just released their first Cinema release, were working on 4 films concurrently (but had many small scale projects under their belt) and had essentially defined the entire field of animation for generations to come. In fact, a lot of the stuff they figured out back then is still applicable today.<p>What's even more startling is when you consider just how much they did, when each film at the time required approximately 2.5 million drawings to complete.<p><pre><code>  Your output is constrained by your animation stable surely.
</code></pre>
I'd say no, it really depends on how you set up the animation pipeline.<p>I've got a different model in mind. I don't want to say too much on how it works, but it has potential to create lots of content with a significantly smaller sized team (to start out with).<p>That's not to say I don't have aspirations to scale it, I do. I'm just focussing on building something from the ground up.",1237366545

521394,comment,521229,521377,0,0,wyclif,,,"Well, part of the ""do it in the Valley"" advocacy is social or VC-oriented.  All those alpha geeks in one place make a lot of connections, work together, recommend each other, go to similar events during rare non-work hours, and some even hire each other or found 2nd startups with partners they met working for their previous employer.  For me, it's easy to grant the truth of this because the history of how these startups began is public record.  I'd rather not try to deny that such connections have great value.<p>I tend to take a more romantic view, one that says that it doesn't matter so much if you don't live in SV or Cambridge, MA even if the current metrics show that your startup will be more successful in those places.<p>I wonder whether SV/Cambridge will lose a little pull since VC has dried up a lot.  Also, buying a home is going to get a lot cheaper in rural places.  Of course, not all cheap places are equal, but what if it truly, really didn't matter where you located?  There's crucial things to research like infrastructure, high speed network capability, the reliability of the public utilities.  The Midwest US could be a great place to found a startup.<p>It seems to me the desire to reach ramen profitability by operating cheaply can outweigh the cachet of advice and networking in the meatspace.",1237366455

It's not (even though there <i>are</i> dirty players) and it's becoming a lot less dirty all the time, since people are becoming smarter at what to buy and not.<p>If you have specialized knowledge and can help people solve a problem or learn something they really want to learn, you can honestly and sincerely produce a product, an e-book, a real book, a video course - whatever - and sell it for a profit. Nothing dirty about that, and the more sincere you are nowadays, the better you'll do.<p>The ""information"" business is no more dirty than any other business. Do the majority of sysadmins do it other than for the money? (No) Do the majority of journalists write pro bono on the side? (Nah) Selling information is no dirtier than selling your time and, heck, I've seen just as many passionate and decent people in the info game than elsewhere.<p>Oh, and don't outsource the ""marketing copy."" It's your personal voice and the personal connection your potential customers will feel for you that will ""sell"" your product. You don't want to be wasting time ""convincing"" people to buy - you want to seem authoritative enough and so trustworthy that people are begging to see more of what you have.<p>P.S. You might enjoy looking into something called the ""underachiever method."" It'll provide one of the best ways to establish what it is you should be producing. It was a course once upon a time but you can get all the core ideas for free with a bit of Googling :)",1237366418

Straw man argument. The original post was a series of questions. My reply to your comment was the hypothesis I posed to myself. They don't contradict each other as the questions were posed as a result of the hypothesis.<p><pre><code>  This is an absurdly small and misleading sample, even within your stated target.
</code></pre>
This was never intended to be conclusive market research, this is just to see if it warranted further research into the topic. In a short space of time (4 hours) I've received some good feedback and suggestions from both parties and been directed to some resources (eg the zombie comic) that I didn't know existed.<p>I could have, for all intensive purposes spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours conducting extensive research - or I could just build the damn thing and release it for much less than what it would cost to obtain ""accurate research"".<p><pre><code>  versus a large, general audience of young viewers who enjoy (and pay for) digital animation content.
</code></pre>
You know, this is where your false argument falls down. You don't have to have a customer paying for the actual content, or even advertising to be able to monetise it. They sure help, but it's not the only method.<p><pre><code>   You specifically stated that you wanted to do this as a low-cost thing
</code></pre>
Finally, you got something correct.<p><pre><code>  thus you can't be making high-quality, specialized content
</code></pre>
Oops, spoke too soon.<p>Just because the big name companies like Pixar and Dreamworks are throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at creating this kind of entertainment, doesn't mean that it is the only way.<p>Think about it for a second, really break it down into its component parts. Your typical animation FILM by those 2 studios is around 90 minutes of entertainment and costs upwards of 100 million dollars each. It's about on par with what Hollywood is spending on films.<p>Now lets look at your average tv show, 22 minutes of entertainment. So if we used the Hollywood blockbuster model, each episode should cost around $25 million plus right? No, it doesn't work that way.<p>Lost for example, which is notorious for being expensive to produce cost (in its first year) $44 million for 22 episodes at 43 minutes (approx) running time each.<p>That's an approximate 10 times the entertainment, for less than half the cost.<p>So if Film and TV operate at completely different scales, then obviously there is a huge disconnect between the cost of production and the amount that someone can be entertained.<p>To further back up my concept, I present to you a video called ""Big Buck Bunny"" - it is essentially a video demo that was created by the Blender Foundation for their open source tool.<p>This video is 10 minutes of animation, completed in 3 months with (depending on how you look at the team makeup) 7-9 guys from concept to delivery using only open source software<p><a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/1084537"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vimeo.com/1084537</a><p>That surely doesn't look like a low quality animation to me.

Though my first read of the material is usually in the paper version of the book (if only so that I may escape my computer chair), my second note-taking pass is always from the digital copy, for I've found taking notes easier when the material is on-screen and adjacent to my text editor. Taking screenshots of illuminating diagrams and inserting them into my notes is much faster than re-sketching the diagrams by hand. The ability to search the book's text rather than thumbing through an index is appreciated. The PDF version of my physics textbook is made available on its associated Web site ( <a href=""http://physicssource.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physicssource.ca/</a> ) -- the electronic copy provided there is the latest printing, which resolves numerous ambiguities and errors present in my paper copy's earlier printing.<p>The only downside I've encountered is the manner in which an electronic textbook tethers me to my computer.

We&#x27;re <i>serious</i>! We&#x27;re <i>engineers</i>! Your language is just a toy because our managers want to keep us fungible!&quot;<p>What does an average &quot;real engineer&quot; C++ programmer have at their disposal? C++ has an ersatz type system (not algebraic and not connected to type theory) and an ersatz macro system (templates and preprocessing) and it offloads type signing onto the programmer (no help from an inferencer). It also lacks a garbage-collector because its followers are still afraid of non-existing &quot;performance penalties&quot;. C++ has an ambiguous grammar that is context-dependent and requires infinite lookahead. Its creator is not any revolutionary thinker like Alan Kay, just some guy that wrote a language and become famous for writing that language. He also said that we hear a lot of complaints about C++ just because a lot of people use it, not because it&#x27;s crap.<p>But bullies like restalis rejoice in the fact that know-nothing managers keep choosing C++ because it&#x27;s the industry bandwagon and you can count on universities to supply the market with a fresh load of programmers trained in mediocre tools time and again.<p>You&#x27;re a bandwagoner.",1429797590

9426663,comment,9426247,9426247,0,0,bko,,,"I think it&#x27;s important to know what Libor is and how it&#x27;s determined.<p>> Each morning, just before 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time, a group of major banks are asked the rate at which they could borrow funds from other banks. The banks confidentially send their results for each of the 15 loan maturities - ranging from overnight to one year - to the market intelligence firm Thomson Reuters. The organization throws out figures in the highest and lowest quartile and averages the remaining half. [0]<p>The rate is used to determine the interest paid on some mortgages (adjustable rate mortgages) as well as some securities (floating rate, pegged to Libor and swaps). You don&#x27;t need to know too much about finance to suspect that the method of determining Libor (informal polling of banks) is ripe for manipulation. I don&#x27;t think the manipulation was biased in any one direction but probably biased based on the particular banks opportunities for that day. Anyone investing in these products or with floating rate mortgages should (in theory) understand how their products work and understand the implications of the method that Libor is set.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to excuse collusion. Just because something is completely transparent and easily gamed doesn&#x27;t excuse dishonesty. My comment is just meant to temper the response and perhaps consider a better system for determining benchmarks.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/how-is-libor-determined.asp#ixzz3Y8kc1mbR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/how-is-libor-dete...</a>",1429797465

However, that is what they are new characters. They are not going replace Cap, Wolverine, Iron-Man, or Thor.

And that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s been a lot of work lately in doing things that either build on or bypass the CA system. For instance, even if you get a valid CA certificate for a site you want to spoof, it still has to be a <i>different</i> certificate, so there&#x27;s more work on certificate pinning. Sure, that doesn&#x27;t help if the spoof cert is up the first time a given person visits a site, but it still raises the bar for successfully attacking a site surreptitiously, because anyone who hits the site post-pin will get a big warning, which can be picked up with other things. Now the attack has to be even better targeted.<p>And there&#x27;s other work going on lately, and while it may not be immediately visible to the general public because this all takes time, it really seems to me this has all gotten a lot more vigorous over the last year. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s all Snowden per se... it seems to me generalized security consciousness has gone up lately, like we passed a critical threshold of people&#x27;s work feeding back on other people&#x27;s work and the community as a whole has moved to a new level of effectiveness. It&#x27;ll still be a while before we really see the changes but I think some changes are coming. (Not <i>Utopia</i>. We&#x27;ve still got a long ways to go.

He is not tracking a specific entity.  Party A meanwhile is doing everything in his power to hide his large intentions (trading across multiple venues, with different executors, at different times, at different sizes, etc).

This is the mechanic for how that smoothness occurs and happens in real life and needn&#x27;t add any impossible principles to the mix for it to occur.<p>In either case, Party A is unhappy about it jumping.

If you vote down, you should not comment.

He&#x27;s spot on about the fundamental players; they want the market to be inefficient so they can make up the difference when it goes to the right value, and they don&#x27;t want to leak their decisions that they&#x27;ve paid a lot of money to come to.<p>To add complexity, it&#x27;s not necessarily the case that someone who almost never trades is spoofing, or that they don&#x27;t want to trade. Consider a simple strategy: I am willing to offer GE shares at 20.00 if the the wider index is trading at 100. In fact because there&#x27;s some sort of relationship (real or imagined) I&#x27;m happy to sell as long as I get more than 1/5 of the index price for my GE shares. I&#x27;m also willing to buy on a similar ratio.<p>Now every time someone trades some other share, the index will move. And I will have to move my price.<p>The thing with spoofing is a spoofer doesn&#x27;t want to trade. They just want to raise until everyone else folds. Just like in poker, it creates noise in the market. How exactly you prove that is hard to say.<p>Another thing, related to manipulation: you can move the market by actually trading as well. Especially if you&#x27;re a big guy. I can&#x27;t count the number of times (normally around expiry) when the index has moved unnaturally only to come right back. I think guys are getting done for this now, and it&#x27;s about time.",1429794119

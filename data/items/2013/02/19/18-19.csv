And when you say weight, you're ignoring other factors like muscle mass, water retention, others, that aren't really what we mean when we say lose weight. (Although incidentally, cutting carbs decreases water retention which is one very valid counter to the low-carb weight loss claims.)<p>Ignoring the very direct counter-statement by OP that he increased his caloric intake and still found success cannot be dismissed.",1361300398

I think the difference is already apparent in that sentence  Drew isnt a substitute for PG and PG isnt a substitute for Drew.<p>YC has never been just PG, there has always been a group of partners (which has increased over a period of time and includes some part-time founders) and you can always arrange time with the partners during office hours.<p>Sure PG and the other partners can provide you with some excellent advice but, no one is an expert in every single vertical. YC fully understand that which is why they bring experts in during YC for dinners as well as hosting conferences for the founders throughout the year.<p>I believe the alumni network has made YC stronger because, they've funded so many companies that there's likely to be other members in the alumni network within the same industry and/or using a similar technology to you  and if you ever need their help then they are there to help you.",1361300379

5246280,story,,,2,7,Acidpunk,"Can I become a developer from scratch at the age of 26?",,"First off I am based in London England ( UK )<p>Basically I was the typical kid during school up until about the age of 14 when I lost interest academically. My grades suffered and I limped through until I got out of secondary school barely getting qualifications as nothing interested me. I went through several college courses BTEC in IT and lost interest in those pretty quickly as the pace of academic study just doesn't seem to suit me.<p>I tried my hand at a few professional courses afterwards starting with A+ and MCSE & Cisco's CCNA and again I was getting involved but the teaching always seemed to be the stumbling block and I'd lose interest.<p>I bounced around for a few years and then finally made the choice to go back to University about 2 years ago. I started off well and obviously my interest in Intro to Programming & Fruther Programming Modules kept me entertained and I got really nice grades 93% and 97% respectively.<p>However once those parts of my Computer Science course finished the other 6 modules served 0 interest for me and I dropped out shortly after.<p>So as you can see limited practical experience little to no formal education.<p>What I do have is an insatiable passion for Computing in general, I grew up addicted to Hardware and followed it relentlessly then got really into Web Dev when I was 16 and then Networking which is what lead me to Cisco and I really enjoyed coding at University.<p>So for someone who's terrible at going the Academic route have I missed the boat on me becoming a developer or am I just not going into things as I should just become self taught?<p>I've been to Google Campus in London there are a ton of startups and the prevailing tend it seemed was the need for Javascript developers. I'm sure I could pick up Javascript quickly enough as well as relearn HTML & CSS<p>Question is, Can I realistically expect to find work with nothing but being self taught & making a GitHub account to show my work ?",1361300312

I don't either, but their main point and recommendation seems pretty uncontroversial:<p>> <i>Colleges need to improve online courses before they deploy them widely. Moreover, schools with high numbers of students needing remedial education should consider requiring at least some students to demonstrate success in traditional classes before allowing them to take online courses.</i><p>They mention some studies (that I haven't read because I'm at work; I'm sure they're not bulletproof) that are broadly consistent with that recommendation.  It would be great to have a truly randomized experiment, but that's unlikely to happen (although one could approximate a randomized experiment w/out too many ethical implications.  For all I know the studies do that, but I don't know).<p>But, as someone who almost never attended lectures as an undergrad, all of the same arguments about online lectures can be made (and I have made) about learning directly from the textbooks.  Most people seem to find that difficult, so I wouldn't be totally shocked to learn that there is a tangible benefit to actually being in the same room as the instructor and asking for clarification at the moment of confusion.<p>Disclaimer: I teach at a university.  For the 250 student intro lecture I teach, I would be unsurprised if it could be taught just as well online, but I would want decent data on it before making up my mind.

There is simply no way the neoconservatives could have convinced Congress of the need to invade Afghanistan or Iraq without the 9/11 attacks. Pearl Harbor may have forced our hand more clearly, so to speak, but both attacks were deep provocations.\nYou can separate out the intent of the attacks if you want to be precise--Japan's to establish military domination in the Pacific, and Al Qaeda's simply to wreak havoc, or what have you--but in broader terms each represented a physical challenge to the United States' influence over particular spheres. And besides, the point that's trying to be made here is exactly that: There may not be any more ""Pearl Harbors,"" if you want to define Pearl Harbor as a military attack by a sovereign nation.

What I don't see is any push to take software engineers and educate them about the lower level stuff to defend against hackers.  Why is this a problem?<p>In your typical large enterprise, software people are paid much better than network people.  (remember, we're not talking about Google or Rackspace.  administering a typical corporate network is relatively simplistic, since the level of variance in software is higher than in network configurations).<p>I used to work in networking, and quickly got bored and learned software and GTFO of the lame networking world.  The networking people I currently know who have obtained the CISSPA security certs have no friggin clue how to code, and frankly just aren't that smart when it comes to this kind of thing.  The people I want defending our networks are the folks at DEFCON who are hacking into every other machine in the room just for fun.  But if you look at the requirements for getting these industry certs, I don't think these people would even qualify.

The reason I am sure I am correct about is two reasons. One is that every time I explain problems with PPACA, I am labelled an ignorant health care reform bigot/hater/militant/republitard/teabagger even though I fully support and advocate for single payer. My support for single payer is deemed irrelevant though, all that is important in this debate with most people is that the all concerns with PPACA be dismissed with handwaving, and anyone opposing it is painted an enemy of reform. The second reason is that the majority of people I have talked to who have issues with PPACA also support or are highly positive towards the idea of a single payer system. Therefore I do not believe that every person he talked to who had objections to PPACA was opposed to reform, that was his own inference.",1361298679

People tend to eat what they grew up eating, and western cuisine is the product of historical contexts in which grain was cheap and meat/fat was expensive.

You can get a lot of the flavor and filling quality of meat and fat without the extra calories from the carbs.<p>E.g. most of the calories in a fajita comes from the tortilla. Most people on a diet might cut net calories by eating half a fajita. Now they're just hungry. I'd rather eat an extra-big portion of the filling out of fajita, maybe with some cheese crumbled on top, and cut calories by getting rid of the least flavorful part of the meal.

I'm going to do my best to provide a quick, yet thorough summary. I hope this helps.<p>Who am I? I'm a techie and a fitness nut. I've played high level basketball, amateur football, rugby, aussie rules football. I've done some triathlons (not my forte), a couple ultra races (hate them, learned a lot about myself). My current area is gaining muscle, losing fat, and building strength. I write fitness books in my nights and weekends (no link provided).<p>I'll try to give the briefest of summaries, though I know it is going to be challenging. If I didn't summarize something well enough or if it is unclear, let me know and I can try to do a better job.<p><i>1. Calories vs Macros also known as Weight vs Composition</i><p>Calories matter for losing and gaining weight, but they don't tell the whole story. If the only thing you know about are calories, you can't lose weight or gain weight intelligently (ie. lose fat and gain muscle). You can do it by accident, but you certainly can't do it optimally.<p>But, I'll offer this, if the only thing you care about is the number on the scale, you can safely just track calories and eat in a deficit. You'll lose weight.<p>Macros, or macronutrients, are important to understand so you can achieve the goal you actually care about. Most people say ""lose weight"" and mean ""lose fat"". ""Gain weight"" actually means ""gain lean muscle"".<p>If that is true of you, you need to understand and track macros. And, no, you do not need to track both macros and calories.  Macros are just fine.<p><i>2. Gaining Muscle</i><p>I wrote an entire book on gaining lean muscle mass complete with 3 workouts, nutrition info and a diet. I'm going to do my best to summarize it here as quickly as possible.<p>A. Workout with heavy weights (see workouts below). \nB. Spike insulin after a workout (more on this in a sec). \nC. Cycle your days.<p>Recommend: \nFor C, cycle your food in the following manner:<p>Workout days: 1g protein/desired lean bodyweight. Even simpler (if you hate math), just 1g protein/desired bodyweight. 1-2g carbs (post workout only)/desired lean bodyweight (this is more important to nail 100%), .5g fat(before workout only)/desired lean bodyweight.<p>Non-workout days: 1g protein/desired lean bodyweight. Even simpler (if you hate math), just 1g protein/desired bodyweight. 0-30g MAX carbs, .5g fat(before workout only)/desired lean bodyweight.<p>For B, you can see above that I'm recommending carbs post workout. The goal with the carbs is two fold: to replenish glycogen stores and to spike insulin. If you are diabetic or for some other reason can't eat carbs, you can still spike insulin, though not as fast and not as high. If no carbs, do the following: protein shake with creatine, leucine (5-10g) and MCT oil (prefer straight MCT, but coconut oil will do as well). (Note: this is the same shake I use in the 'lose fat' below to still build some muscle while losing fat).<p><i>3. Losing Fat</i><p>Again, I wrote an entire book on this, so I'll do my best to summarize. Remember, lose fat probably means 'lose fat and maintain whatever lean muscle mass I currently have' .<p>A. Workout with heavy weights (preferred, mostly to maintain your muscle mass...need to continue to stimulate the body), sprints/HIIT, or very low intensity walking (mid-level cardio, i.e. running is bad for this goal, just FYI). \nB. Spike insulin without carbs post heavy weight workout. If HIIT or low intensity cardio, NO insulin spike. \nC. Carbs once a week.<p>For A, I prefer people to continue to workout with heavy weights simply to make sure they can maintain their muscle, or even pack a bit more on.<p>For B, just use the same post workout shake above. Again, if workout was HIIT or low-intensity cardio, don't do this.<p>And for C, follow ""non-workout day"" above and go ultra low carb for 5-6 days a week (in a row). Then carb-refeed (also called carbing up) once or twice a week. I highly recommend you start out with this approach: \n6.5 days ultra low carb (less than 30g/day) and then on the 7th night, have a 6 hour window where you eat basically whatever carbs you want. On the order of 300-700g of carbs in that window. The next day you are going to feel pretty bloated and you'll gain weight (water), but in 2-3 days all that is gone and you are back to losing fat. The reason for the .5 days of carbs is hormonal adjustment.<p>I initially intended to write much more, but this is already getting too long for a HN post. It is really hard to summarize everything down to the barest of essentials, so I hope I did an adequate enough job for people to get a start.",1361297575

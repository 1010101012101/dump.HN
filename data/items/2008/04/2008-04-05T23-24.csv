You: It's so certain, it's basically guaranteed!<p>You can be a person who behaves very aggressively with what appears to be extremely risky behavior but at the same time calculate risk very carefully with as much data as possible. This is what I aim to be, a calculated risk taker. Not a foolish man who dives head first without thinking.<p>Motivation is really great, but I don't see a lot of value in blind optimism.",1207438839

155864,comment,155717,155801,0,0,hugh,,,"If by ""stereotypes are usually correct"" you mean that if there is a stereotype that says ""people of group G have property P"" then people in group G are statistically more likely than average to have property P than the general population, then you may very well be right that stereotypes are correct more often than they're incorrect, but it kinda misses the point of why stereotyping is a bad idea.",1207438579

155859,comment,155717,155717,0,0,lutorm,,,"Stereotype threat is such an interesting concept. It's closely connected to the idea of malleability of intelligence as explained in e.g. this article:<p><a href=""http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-sm...</a><p>It raises interesting issues of what people actually mean when they want someone who ""is smart and gets things done"". Just the basic expression ""smart people"" seems to imply that you have rejected the idea of malleability of intelligence and think that people are either smart or not. I'm not really arguing that there is not an innate random quality to ""aptitude"", but if you believe that article you don't want someone who is smart, you want someone who has worked hard to acquire important skills, since people who just think of themselves as ""smart"" are more likely to cave when faced with difficulty.",1207437597

In these numerous cases, ""future price"" would not equal lower. Certainly, technology drives prices down but technology is not the only factor that affects pricing. Unless you mean very long term? But in very long term, everything is just going to go to zero so that frame of reference is not very useful.<p>I agree that this elimination of competition is bad for the consumers, bad for innovation, and bad for those more capable companies that didn't get the huge funding. It's just making the rich richer.",1207437369

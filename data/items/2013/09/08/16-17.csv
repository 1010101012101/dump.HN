Assuming that you&#x27;ve done a reasonable job of option 2, I gravitate towards option 1 and maybe option 4 (depending on how confident you are of your team&#x27;s technical capabilities and how expensive consultants are relative to additional hardware).<p>These are intermediate steps that have helped, giving us some time to figure we whether want to migrate to a different database:<p>1) We started using InnoDB a few years ago.<p>2) One of our common queries joined parts of multiple large tables; we essentially cached the useful parts of the join and put the results into a memory table.<p>3) Our non-production server is under a lot of load from our back-end processes, and we decided to move the database to a RAM disk, which greatly improved performance. It&#x27;s important to note that, while inconvenient, a power outage is not catastrophic in our case (e.g. we don&#x27;t deal with financial transactions); we do daily backups to non-volatile memory. For around $5,000, you can build your own server that has over 250 GB of RAM and then put it into a co-location facility.<p>We seriously considered migrating to Postgres, but #3 has bought us some time on that front. It might be that we eventually still migrate, but we prefer to do it after the company is on better financial footing. It might also be that while we wait, other less painful options open up over time (e.g. maybe MariaDB will suffice).<p>I hope the situation resolves well.",1378659587

Synchronous, sequential circuits can be obtained by taking a combinational circuit and connecting the first n outputs to the first n inputs via D flip-flops. If you want asynchronous circuits, you can add another combinator that takes a circuit and a connects the first n outputs to the first n inputs without the flip-flops.<p>With these definitions, it&#x27;s quite straight forward to manipulate circuits in a functional manner.",1378659442

For this technique we recommend rigorous training. -Horowitz<p>All therapy is &quot;black magic&quot; in the sense that no-one quite understands exactly how it works.  CBT gets props because it&#x27;s one of the few therapies that has a manual and can actually be studied scientifically.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but I prefer to speak with a therapist who doesn&#x27;t have to consult a manual for every response he/she makes.  Therapy is ultimately a human relationship, and just as messy and unpredictable as any other relationship - and subject to all the contingencies thereofe.<p>Just because something cannot be studied scientifically does not mean it is not effective.  Evidence for the limited long term effectiveness (high relapse rates, ect) of shallow and manualized interventions like CBT is growing by the day.  Compare that with more messy therapies that dig deeper (like psychodynamic) whose outcomes actually improve the longer the subjects are tracked.<p>The vast majority of the effectiveness of therapy is due to hope (placebo effect) and the relationship.  Focusing on the &quot;technique&quot; is distracting and leads to a view of therapy as something that is done to you, as opposed to something that is done with you.  Lasting change comes from taking personal responsibility, not from having special &quot;scientific&quot; techniques done to you.<p>That para-professionals with 2 weeks of training have outcomes as good or sometimes better than those with Ph.d&#x27;s in clinical psychology is all one needs to know when deciding whether or not to categorize psychotherapy as a science.",1378659047

Yes, no doubt Montessori had a big impact back in the day -- it&#x27;s still being felt now. But I doubt that this explains all of the changes we&#x27;re seeing. More likely is that things that seem to work are copied.<p>Models are always faulty in some way, but using them appropriately can be a good thing. The problem many of these corporate styles addresses is that <i>it&#x27;s very easy to overconstrain your solution space without realizing it</i>. This turns out to be extremely important in creative tasks. Not so much everywhere, but in places where teams are supposed to be both creating and radically optimizing their work streams? Makes a huge difference.<p>We&#x27;re also seeing the emergence of a personal corporate brand, where companies are supposed to have personalities, like people. Employees are encouraged to get Twitter accounts. Everything that faces the public is supposed to look like &quot;Hey! We&#x27;re having a blast here, and we can&#x27;t wait to help you out.&quot; The majority of the corporate submarine pieces we see on HN have this subtext.<p>These are major changes.

6349254,comment,6348504,6349023,2,0,mokus,,,"> If those documents were not supposed to be viewable, the server should reject the request.<p>It certainly should, but it also should be obvious that this was not information that he was authorized to have, and he was prosecuted for intentionally scraping it after noticing the misconfiguration - not for making an HTTP GET request.<p>The idea that a GET request is like asking a clerk for an item under a counter is appealing, but doesn&#x27;t really work because granting access is not the same as granting authorization.  Authorization requires intent, and an HTTP server is incapable of intent (at this point in history, anyway).  The fact that the server can be misconfigured and is fundamentally incapable of realizing it means it makes a lot more sense to think of it as the counter rather than the clerk, and items with 403 responses as items that are under a glass counter.  For this same reason, the FOIA request example doesn&#x27;t work either.  A human (or many of them) processes that request.<p>Additionally, the items he took were not items the store sells, they were clearly items the store should not have out in a public place (so yes, the &quot;store&quot; is absolutely not blameless).<p>In light of these observations, I think a better analogy is this:<p>A man walks into a store.  He spots a binder on the back counter, just close enough he can reach it without actually stepping behind the front counter.  It contains a printout of the store&#x27;s mailing/cold-calling list that they use for [whatever silly purpose].  The clerk is busy elsewhere, so he starts flipping through it page by page, taking a photo of each one with his smart phone.<p>Now, I&#x27;m still not sure what I think of the legality or morality of the situation, especially when you try to factor in intent.  I&#x27;m also not a legal professional of any kind, so I know even less about what a court would think about all that.  But I do think that these details are relevant, and leaving them out of an analogy creates a false impression that there&#x27;s nothing even debatable about the situation.<p>Edited to add: FWIW I do agree that AT&T is very much at fault, mainly for the reasons phaus gave in the comment sibling to yours.  I just don&#x27;t think it is obviously the case that their guilt excuses the person that takes advantage of that negligence.",1378658468

Others in the same vein are Agda, Idris, Epigram, Isabelle. Each one shares more similarities with the others than with their &quot;host&quot; language (if one exists) of which they&#x27;re usually syntactic cousins.<p>That said, each of them is far more similar to OCaml/Haskell than say, C.<p>They are all based to some degree or another on Martin Lf&#x27;s Intuitionistic Type Theory which is a wonderful unification of mathematical logic and straightforward functional programming in the same vein as the Curry-Howard Isomorphism.<p>Generally, much of the forward research is aimed at making the proofs more automatic and easier to use. The problem is wildly intractable by brute force, so much cleverer tricks must be employed. Some of these are quite wonderful and suggest new ways of programming as a dialogue between a human and an intelligent compiler that I really hope become more common in the future, though the industry will be unlikely to drive it. See the literature on Epigram for some talk about this.<p>There&#x27;s also an important distinction between proof systems and &quot;dependently typed languages&quot; where proof systems restrict their power greatly so as to ensure the things which are proved in them are mathematically consistent while dependently typed languages which are more &quot;practical&quot; seek only to provide proof-like heuristic support to programming. In the former, you&#x27;ll likely see a complex way of describing group theory in the language of program types and the program itself is irrelevant because its mere existence is sufficient for logical purposes. In the latter, you&#x27;ll see a strong synthesis of a program and its internal logic as expressed by its types which ensure that invalid programs are wildly difficult to write as you&#x27;ll likely have to abuse some crazy flaw in intuitionistic logic in order to do so.<p>The most canonical example is the fixed-length vector where you can write things like &quot;append takes two vectors and results in one that&#x27;s the sum of their lengths&quot; and thus track (statically!) that you have no out of bounds errors possible in your program. It&#x27;s also incredibly useful for getting nice properties like &quot;this vector-of-vectors representation of a matrix is <i>not</i> ragged&quot; confirmed at compile time... something that even an advanced non-dependently typed language like Haskell or OCaml is (mostly) strictly in the domain of runtime checking.",1378657785

These are quite different things, coming from quite different places. Open plan offices have very little to do with happy employees, and everything to do with productivity.<p>I detect a subtext when he says &#x27;hierarchical is better, managers should think about strategy, Blackberry CEOs are a <i>professional</i> manager and a <i>technician</i> (which is a loaded word, as it means a low skilled technical worker).<p>I mean, is this a backlash against the increasingly irrelevance of management in flat organizations? If we read an article by an IT worker, explaining that Amazon Cloud might be making him irrelevant, but companies migrating to it are making a huge mistake, then we would see his true motivations in writing that. I wonder if computer enabled flat management is making people like Schumpeter feel under threat.<p>The idea of risks and experimentation, is that companies like Google are not creating products through a predictable process - they are farming black swans.<p>You can manufacture software to spec predictably. If you can find developers who will work to spec, remain motivated without personal control of their work, and generally put up with being treated like a production line worker, you can make software on a production line.

Normally it is a very small value for the number of simultaneous connections you likely support. Increasing it can result in elimination of random pauses/slowdowns.<p>In general, it is impossible to &quot;tune MySQL&quot; though. You can allow it to use more system resources and in some cases you can get it to be less durable to gain write performance, but to get orders of magnitude increases you need to restructure your data. Try sharing or partitioning data. Increase or reduce the number of indecies. Denormalize data. Archive logs to flat files. Put the OS, /var/lib, and /var/log on separate physical drives. Run MySQL on bare metal since disk IO is often a bottleneck and virtualization can add overhead. Restructure the data. At one point a write heavy app I was optimizing was logging things to the database (that needed to be queries). Each log entry contained extra data we did not query. One speed up that worked was throwing the majority of the extra data into a single gzipped JSON blob. This made it easier for MySQL to fetch fewer pages. Less IO, faster operation.",1378657086

6349175,comment,6347401,6347401,3,0,thelettere,,,"&quot;Mental illnesses are disorders of the brain that disrupt a persons thinking, feeling, moods, and ability to relate to others.  Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illnesses are brain disorders... [They] are not a result of personal weakness, lack of character, or poor upbringing.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s from a 2000 pamphlet written by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  Kandal&#x27;s claim that this is new is BS - it&#x27;s an old idea, and one not demonstrated by the research he cites.  It&#x27;s simply more evidence that mental illnesses are mediated by biological processes - something we&#x27;ve known for years.<p>The claim that mental illnesses are &quot;caused&quot; by biology is just as false now as it was then, and these experiments make no suggestion in either direction.<p>Clearly, neither study permits inferences about cause.  Again, just because biological processes are involved does not mean that it is triggered by it.  This is the same idea that&#x27;s been pushed by over-zealous neuro-scientists for years.  It&#x27;s based on the belief that if we just drill down far enough in biology and genetics, we will explain most of the variance in behaviors.<p>If you don&#x27;t cherry-pick the evidence, the whole picture suggests the same story that we&#x27;ve known for quite a while - but some in the psych/mental illness field aren&#x27;t satisfied with it because the truth doesn&#x27;t fit with their cravings for prestige - with our cultural obsession with the biological being more &quot;real&quot; than the social.  Not to mention the financial aspects - one of the reasons we know so little about the social etiology of mental illness is because there&#x27;s so little funding available for it.<p>The evidence suggests that environmental factors are just as involved - and in many cases is the primary cause, which plays on biological vulnerabilities that determine how the illness is expressed and through which it becomes self-perpetuating, not only for the individual, but on down through the family through cultural transmission and epigenetics.<p>Why does this even matter though?  Because our perceptions of mental illness influences its outcome - how we view mental illness determines in large part what it is and how it expresses itself.  If we believe it&#x27;s fundamentally a fixed genetic and biological disorder that the individual themselves is helpless to do anything about, then through the nocebo effect it becomes a self fulfilling prophesy.

It also helps with writes because it can take a lot of pressure off the master.<p>...assuming you&#x27;re webvet.com it looks like you&#x27;re scaling drupal, so these would be my first questions: are you using the views module? if so, kill that, as well as anything else by merlin (panels, etc).  and look at your indexes.  setup pressflow + percona.  master & slave db.  reverse proxy caching (varnish or nginx) are all good places to start.  hostwise if you&#x27;re not already on amazon, you can get a lot of mileage out of a service like voxel that lets you mix VPSs (cheap webheads) with physical hardware.  it&#x27;s not great and it may well be worth biting the more expensive bullet and going to AWS for long term needs, but it&#x27;s a lot better than linode for an underwater db.<p>my email is in my profile if you&#x27;d like more detail - drupal is a bear at first but it can be scaled for a while.",1378656246

6349142,comment,6348903,6348903,1,0,morgo,,,"Hi!<p>There are some good suggestions in this thread already.  Step #1 is to determine why it is slow.<p>If it is slow under load, then I am going to suspect that you are hitting table locks - which means you need to migrate to InnoDB (row locking + MVCC).  Important to point out: a bigger server may not actually help enough here, because while you are waiting on locks nothing can be done while there is free capacity waiting to be used.<p>If it is just generally slow related to growth, it can probably be improved by indexing - which will help you reduce what data needs to be in RAM.<p>In either case, two third party tools to suggest:\n- pt-query-digest: aggregate your slow query log.  You want to use 0 seconds as the threshold, record 20 minutes of slow queries during regular activity.  Methodology described here: <a href=""http://gtowey.blogspot.ca/2012/07/slow-query-log-is-not.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gtowey.blogspot.ca/2012/07/slow-query-log-is-not.html</a><p>- pt-online-schema-change: you can migrate from MyISAM to InnoDB online via triggers (not online by default).<p>Both tools part of <a href=""http://www.percona.com/software/percona-toolkit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.percona.com/software/percona-toolkit</a>",1378656187

That being; if it weren&#x27;t for interference from intelligent life, humans, the earth would go on being in perfect environmental equilibrium for all time.  In reality the earth&#x27;s environment has always been changing.  Those changes have been taking place since the beginning and many of them were the result of the effects of various living organisms humans included.<p>So isn&#x27;t the desire of humans to preserve &#x27;our&#x27; environment, in it&#x27;s present state, in some sense a selfish desire to curtail the inevitable march of environmental change which might threaten the species but would almost certainly happen with or without us?",1378656031

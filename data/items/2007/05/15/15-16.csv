(Actually, I suspect an even bigger advantage is a supportive peer group and a sense that you don't want to let your investors down, but nobody's mentioned that yet.)  That's worth a lot more than a bank loan, because it's <i>a lot more than money</i>.  A bank loan for $15,000 will not increase your startup's chances of success nearly as much as being accepted to YC.",1179244575
22260,comment,22248,22248,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"Essay comes off as a poorly written rant.  However, there is a sliver of truth there; PG would benefit from a little more humility.  So would the whole program, actually.  It sometimes has a very ""clubby"" feel to it - you're either in, or you're not.<p>Even though this isn't a big issue now, it might benefit them to address it before YC gets a reputation of arrogance.  This is especially important, given YC essentially bashes a thousand egos a year.  Even if 1% of those guys start blogs like this, that's bad news.",1179244236
22259,comment,22248,22248,0,0,npk,,,"Wow,<p>This guy's whole blog (not just the article) is based on bashing YC & YC funded companies.  There are some valid cons to YC Funding: the funding comes at a low valuation, and it is scary to build a company without a clear path to monetization.  But this guy basically repeats this over, and over, and over again.  Don't expect any enlightenment.  Lame.\n",1179244224
22258,comment,21863,22184,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Is FreeNet really all that successful?  I remember seriously looking into it back in 2000, when Napster and Gnutella and FreeNet were all the rage, and thinking it was incredibly innovative and potentially world-changing.  However, back then it had no GUI and required that you search for files by <i>hash code</i>, both of which were showstoppers for me.  I've kinda forgotten about it since, because none of my friends use it.  The Wikipedia article suggests that it still has speed and usability problems.  Have they fixed the showstoppers that made me ignore it in 2000?",1179244175
22257,comment,22248,22248,0,0,budu3,,,"I guess the Newsweek article is bringing PG a lot of unwanted attention.<p>\ ""there is no need for a marketing budget when youÂve got Internet word of mouth.Â Of course - build it and they will come right?<p>In PG's defense I don't think he meant to imply that if you build it they'll come. I think he was emphasising the power of Internet word of mouth for an Internet business as opposed to traditions marketing channels. BTW. It doesn't seem like the above quote was PG's, unless I'm mistaken.<p>That being said, the author made some valid points. For one, even if the YC hopefully know they gonna accept the offer even before applying, giving them 5 mins to respond, and then suggesting that anyone not responding within that time in unintelligent makes PG come of as arrogant, if not a bully.<p>Secondly, I don't think PG can be blamed for a YC founder's personal choice to leave his pregnant wife to pursue a startup (this is a far stretch from the true story) and poor dietary choices of YC founders.

It's constantly improving, e.g. generics, enums, and much more with version 5, and there's talk of adding closures to the language.<p>The amount of open source software and libraries for Java is also staggering.<p>The JVM platform is great and improving all the time. <p>If you like dynamic languages, why not try something that runs on the JVM as bytecode, like Groovy, JRuby, or Jython?  You'll get the best of both worlds and can call Java code from your dynamic language.",1179242164

22242,comment,22062,22062,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"No. <p>In fact, Google uses it to build their web apps (GWT). Its not going away, rather it keeps expanding and morphing to fit new emerging needs.<p>To hackers who feel tied down by the rigid structure of statically typed languages, it probably seems dead. Higher level loosely typed interpreted languages seem to be the growing trend now.<p>Dead on the Client? I don't think so. Does no one here code in Eclipse? Azureus and several other really good client apps are Java. It is a very attractive choice considering the wide range of classes in the core API and in open source libraries.<p>Besides GWT, Java web development sucks though, IMHO. JSF did not improve things much. They are trying to add AJAX features but it just doesn't work. Its too cumbersome for hackers to work with IMHO. ",1179241513

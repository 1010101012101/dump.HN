As a developer, I was able to install other browsers (that was against the company IT policy, but I didn't care). When I was working on the business side, though, I didn't have admin access to my machine, and so I had to use IE6, like everyone else.<p>All the internal apps were built to work on IE6, too. And there are a <i>lot</i> of internal apps. Half of them wouldn't display properly on Firefox when I tried opening them there (this was a few years ago, I didn't try Chrome or Safari).",1275735525

    damage readability. Further, a good compiler will get
    most, if not all, of the efficiency for you without
    making these changes.

If changes damage readability and don't change the compiled code, <i>don't make them!</i><p>Readability has to be balanced against efficiency, but too often people think something is more efficient when it isn't.  As always, profile before ""improving.""<p>As I say, these are issues for discussion.

1406715,comment,1406402,1406402,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I would think Freyd and Scedrov's work on Allegories (replace functions in categories with relations) would be more suitable for relational databases. That said I'm somewhat skeptical of the use of category theory as more than just a beautiful descriptive language. As someone once mentioned, ""it's all just definitions, there are no theorems"", which is a bit of a stretch but there is truth in it.<p>Mathematically a function is just a special case of a relation. I like to think of relations, as they might be modeled as columns of a table, as ""extensional"" (they relate things to one another), functions are more like attributes. Storing relations in tables involves a commitment to a schema. This is the beauty of a document store such as CouchDB. A document is a uniquely identified collection of name-value pairs. There's nothing that prevents one from viewing these values as other entities but I like to model them as attributes. In this sense document stores seem to occupy a sweet spot in between relational databases and graph databases, such as RDF where every instance is just part of a labeled graph, or k-v stores where the values can be anything.<p>However at the end of the day, databases are all about b-trees and page boundaries and the Yoneda embedding just isn't going to help you with that, in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_(category_theory)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_(category_theory)</a>",1275733497

Regardless of how many history books you may read, for example, it will not shed the same insight as a profound discussion with a highly-experienced academic in the field. This is true for many aspects of the humanities.<p>Which isn't to say self-study is worthless, but rather that it is a poor substitute for interaction with your professors. IMHO to claim that liberal arts can be just as well studied by oneself is myopic and tunnel-visioned, and about equivalent to me claiming that aspiring nuclear engineers should pick up some textbooks instead of going to school.<p>IMHO the whole topic of the monetary worth of schooling is an interesting and worthwhile one - but discussions on it on forums such as this one is invariably tainted by the fact that many people in our field have incredibly arrogant and misguided superiority complexes about technical degrees over the arts. I personally tend to think that one ought to be responsible for their own academic spending, and that studies of the arts is a luxury that not everyone can afford - but I hesitate to voice this often, since many of my engineering peers hold this opinion out of disdain and trivialization of the humanities, and I really don't want to be associated with that kind of ignorance.",1275732121

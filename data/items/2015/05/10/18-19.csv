The maintainer scolds you for using merges instead of fast forwards.&quot;<p>Imagine you clone a repo. So your version is identical. You now add a couple more commits to master. Now, to make them identical again, all you have to do is upload the new commits, and then get his master branch to update to point to the latest one. Makes sense, right? That&#x27;s a fast-forward.<p>Instead, what you do is merge your latest commit with the older commit two back, which creates a third commit with <i>identical content to the previous one</i>. That&#x27;s silly, right? That&#x27;s why fast-forward instead of merge.<p>> &quot;You decide to bring in some more code from the public repo. Here is a 6000 word essay on what rebase means.&quot;<p>Rebase is when you take the content from a chain of commits, and make a completely new chain with that same content, just because it makes it look neater. You then change the branch from pointing at the head of the old chain to pointing at the head of the new. That&#x27;s all it does. The old chain is still there until it&#x27;s garbage collected a few weeks later (or you tag it to stop it disappearing).<p>> &quot;You try to look at an old version of the code. Suddenly you are in ‘detached HEAD’ state. The End.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the fear is here, so I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you. Create a test repository with a few commits and change the hashes below for real ones:<p><pre><code>    git checkout master # on master, whew\n    git checkout e34a53 # oh no, detached head\n    git checkout master # it&#x27;s ok, back on master, whew\n    git checkout 343a34 # oh no, detached head\n    git checkout master # it&#x27;s ok, back on master, whew\n    git checkout fe34ee # oh no, detached head\n    git checkout master # it&#x27;s ok, back on master, whew\n    git checkout a567ed # oh no, detached head\n    git checkout master # it&#x27;s ok, back on master, whew\n</code></pre>\nRepeat until you&#x27;re not panicking? :-)",1431283313

I used CrashPlan and Backblaze before that, for a couple of years, but had issues with both.<p>I would like to point out something many people overlook. If you use an online backup service, check how decryption is done. If you have to supply your decryption password to an on-line form, somebody has access to your data, and all the encryption has been for nothing (this was my problem with Backblaze).<p>Arq is great, because it decouples storage from backup. You pay for Arq, which buys you a backup program, and you buy storage separately, from any of the supported providers. You can also switch storage providers over the long term. I am very happy with this approach.<p>Arq has also proven to be much more reliable than either Crashplan or Backblaze&#x27;s client app.",1431283166

And I think that should be obvious to everyone, locking up people in unsafe areas, where others too are ill in mind, where most are folks who&#x27;ve had poor lives and poor fortunes, it only reinforces the wrong ideals and norms. The Scandinavian model of rehabilitation probably works better: putting people in safe homes with counselors who show love instead of hate, and a general treatment of dignity (one that they were not shown before -- indeed almost all violent criminals come from broken homes, almost all criminals never had a positive and loving authority figure to show them the way). Why not break the cycle and treat them with respect?<p>> I don&#x27;t think that justification is as important when we&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s essentially a commercial crime. It doesn&#x27;t even implicate personal safety in the same way as say burglary.<p>I don&#x27;t like that distinction of violent crimes and non-violent crimes, it&#x27;s too easy, it makes it seem like the non-violent crimes are not bad enough. You know how michaelochurch used to equate managers who gave references to attempted murder or something to that effect? That was of course silly, but I can actually kind of appreciate the logic in that... in today&#x27;s society these actions essentially make or break a person&#x27;s life. Not in terms of life and death, but it makes the difference of a life of dignity and work to possible homelessness and a complete inability to provide for your family. And further down in this continuum, there&#x27;s financial crimes, there&#x27;s the SV crimes (inculcating bullshit ideas by way of crafty advertising, .

The first is the notion of optimization by randomness and the second is evolution by natural selection.<p>For the first issue, there are is a simple way of seeing what I&#x27;m talking about; If you are trying to optimize an algorithm for <i>given</i> results, there are three broad techniques which I will categorize for simplicity as &#x27;stupid&#x27;, &#x27;random&#x27;, and &#x27;smart.&#x27;<p>For instance, if I wanted to sort a deck of cards, I could just shuffle it until I had a sorted deck. That&#x27;s &#x27;random.&#x27; This is not the worst you can do, and only if you do worse can random be an improvement. To do worse, you have to actively prevent the deck from becoming sorted. (For example, by using an algorithm that guarantees a 1-3-2 order at the start.) Randomness is not optimization, and stupidity is optimization away from the goal. Smart is convergence on a goal.<p>However, evolution is not a goal directed process. Those who exist are simply those who lived long enough in the environments they happened find themselves. Randomness doesn&#x27;t improve any organism or any feature of any organism: it only improves <i>diversity</i>, which allows for more niches to be filled. I mean, maybe this increases the availability of food or the amount of space per organism or something, but it doesn&#x27;t actually improve organisms. It improves the environment by making it less hostile to life in the abstract.<p>So it has nothing to do with hill climbing or optimization per se.",1431281325

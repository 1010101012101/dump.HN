There are a significant number of people who seem to think that ""relevant for everyone"" belongs on other sites, whereas ""<i>specifically</i> relevant to hackers"" belongs here.  You can go to reddit for ""relevant for everyone"".  Also, consider how <i>much</i> stuff is relevant to everyone.  It would swamp the hacker news in a heartbeat if we started adding everything that's relevant.",1203875984

Compare that to the article's ""If you're 95th-percentile lucky you might get a post-doc position, then you have a 50-50 chance of getting a tenure <i>track</i> position.""  Your odds are about 10 times better with the tech startup.<p>Then consider that at a minimum, you should expect 2 years of postdoc and another 6 years before getting tenure.  That's now 14 years of training before you can actually work on what you want.  14 startup attempts with a 90% failure rate gives you a roughly 80% chance of success.

122557,comment,122121,122121,0,0,wallflower,,,"In the network marketing world (of which I observed as a passive participant briefly), they have a saying - don't confuse activity as productivity. For example, in network marketing, filling out paperwork and reading web sites and listening to tapes are (low-value) spin your wheel activities. Approaching prospects, inviting people to meetings, mentoring, and selling product are high-value productivity. These productive activities can all be measured: As one of the co-founders of HP said in a maxim: ""You can't make what you don't measure"". For your startup, intend to focus on activities where you can measure results and success. Billing will be one - you can even see if people actually use it.",1203874211

If you're building something people want, selling software over the internet can be figured out, and you can find developers to make it.<p>The first thing start ups should do is show evidence that people want what you are offering.  Afterwards, figure out if the cost of customer acquisition < price they will pay (or advertising or whatever). Then you have a good business idea.<p>Viaweb, for instance, let businesses get a web presence easily at a price they could afford.

And sometimes they are unaware of how they do what they do - they just do it - like some hackers.

Behind the soft-porn young american look/magalog that is the A&F marketing ethos, there is a darker side of requiring low-hourly-wage earning employees to spend nearly all their wages on A&F clothes (lawsuit was settled) and attractive employees being required to recruit other attractive employees (either sex) to work for A&F, whenever they were out and about (e.g. partying).",1203873620

The first is the organisation's rate of expansion. The second is the quality of human resources.<p>Regarding the rate of expansion, it is widely known that a company which repeatly grows at 100% per year is consumed by bozos. However, an organisation which does not expand may also be consumed by bozos. This is because the superstars don't wish to remain in a company which is mere ""treading water"" and therefore the quality of staff declines. It is very likely that the optimal rate of expansion is small and steady on the basis that it is better to not hire at all rather than hire badly.<p>Regarding human resources, if you've got a company with 100 staff then it is logical to delegate hiring. At this point, hiring takes a life of its own. After human resources personnel are added or replaced, you'll have people who've been hired by people who've been hired by people that you hired personally. If you're not careful then new hires could be of <i>any</i> quality.<p>Google has been relatively close to 100% expansion in some years. So, I'd argue that Google's human resources is closely monitored. Indeed, you could take an educated guess and say that the success of hiring could be monitored with an algorithm. Maybe this is a ranking algorithm? It is also extremely probable that job applications are filtered automatically.",1203873019

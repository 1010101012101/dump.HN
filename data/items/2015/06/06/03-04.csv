With this, I actually ended up choosing to work mostly on open source projects and contracting work (contracting part time). I was in Ohio, so cost of living is next to nothing compared to SF (my share of a 3br house is $400/mo 10 minutes from downtown Columbus).<p>From here, once I had the desire to get back into the grind and onto a team I started selectively applying to new firms I was interested in and truly trying to make a connection, rather than blindly sending out resumes.<p>It took about 6 months to get to the point I wanted to dive back in again, but I have worked on wonderful and incredibly interesting projects ranging from designing packages for the Atom editor to enable better accessibility for the blind to working with medical and legal startups adding features.

I recommend this because it walks through the implementation of basic data structures that you will be working with no matter what you&#x27;re doing.<p>K&R is a good reference, but I only found it useful after I knew enough to actually get things done. I didn&#x27;t find it good to learn with, and I was already proficient in a couple of scripting languages.<p>I also recommend Richard Stevens books. Advanced Unix Programming and Unix Network Programming are excellent. I&#x27;m not sure what you want to work on, so that might not be relevant.<p>For studying how non-trivial things are implemented I like TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, and The Design and Implementation of the Freebsd Operating System.<p>One of the things you&#x27;re going to find about C that&#x27;s different from higher level languages is that it&#x27;s so minimal that you&#x27;re going to have to build up a personal library of code to get things done.<p>For code samples, I like to look at OpenBSD. It&#x27;s all in one place and there&#x27;s less cruft than most of the alternatives. This is useful because while the key tasks of a particular program might be described well in one of the books I mentioned, it&#x27;s not the same as a real modern program. I&#x27;ve found it really helpful to actually look at something that&#x27;s stood the test of time for inspiration. Also, it&#x27;s man pages are awesome.

9669555,comment,9666194,9668962,0,0,tempestn,,,"Thanks.  From that page, the part that most directly addresses my concerns is this:<p>> Do grants distort local markets? It seems possible to us that a large infusion of cash into an area could alter economic opportunities for both recipients and non-recipients. Such effects could be positive (for example by spurring investment and job creation or by increasing the availability of retail goods) or negative (for example, by leading primarily to local inflation). The limited evidence addressing this issue in the RCT of GiveDirectly&#x27;s program in Rarieda[1] and the broader literature on cash transfers points to no distortion. There is an ongoing RCT[2] of GiveDirectly&#x27;s program that is testing for macroeconomic effects.<p>Not a ton of concrete results as yet, especially for the larger macroeconomic effects, but at least from that one study the local effects appear to be minor. Certainly more research would be valuable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#Whatarethepotentialdownsidesoftheintervention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cas...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly#GE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-dir...</a>",1433562574

In another work of his (and he&#x27;s not the only one analysing these matters), he lampoons the kinds of critique offered by Ethan Miller.<p>Kirschenbaum writes: &quot;Herewith, then, are some of the terrible things of my title, hardly any of which are exaggerated for effect: Digital humanities is a nest of big data ideologues. Digital humanities digs MOOCs. Digital humanities is an artifact of the post-9/11 security and surveillance state (the NSA of the MLA). Like Johnny, digital humanities can’t read. Digital humanities doesn’t do theory. Digital humanities never historicizes. Digital humanities is complicit. Digital humanities is naive. Digital humanities is hollow huckster boosterism. Digital humanities is managerial. Digital humanities is the academic import of Silicon Valley solutionism (the term that is the shibboleth of bad-boy tech critic Evgeny Morozov). Digital humanities cannot abide critique. Digital humanities appeals to those in search of an oasis from the concerns of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Digital humanities does not inhale (easily the best line of the bunch). Digital humanities wears Google Glass. Digital humanities wears thick, thick glasses (guilty). Perhaps most damning of all: digital humanities is something separate from the rest of the humanities, and—this is the real secret—digital humanities wants it that way. Terrible things indeed these are!&quot;[2]<p>Miller reiterates many of these positions without acknowledgement that not only have they been discussed before, they have even become points of ridicule. Perhaps one does not need to agree with those <i>within</i> DH, like Kirschenbaum, but to regurgitate &quot;MOOCs&quot;, &quot;silicon valley&quot; and &quot;big data&quot; without at least a passing familiarity with the discussions that have been going on is more than a little shallow.<p>Yet, DH usually thinks of itself as &quot;big tent&quot;, so competing histories and conceptions are part of its very fabric, and sure to be welcomed. The problem with assessments of DH from the <i>outside</i> is that they usually end up rather unsavoury and polemic, hence Kirschenbaum&#x27;s invocation of William Pannapacker&#x27;s rabble rousing and the attendant fallout.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-2-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackw...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dhterriblethingskirschenbaum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dhterrible...</a>",1433560579

(we statically link QT and boost, which may cause more headaches than the default dynamic linking).<p>Specifically, maintaining backwards compatibility on OSX while marching forward with newer versions of the os has been a very big pain. We recently dropped support for OSX 10.6 because we simply could not get QT to statically compile on Yosemite, even after extracting the 10.6 SDK from a legacy xcode download. We did manage to keep 10.7 support though, thankfully, using the same SDK extraction method.<p>On Linux, the upgrade from QT 4.8 to 5.4 was the roughest. the number of dependencies dramatically increased, complicating the compilation of QT and breaking compatibility with older distros (specifically CentOS 6.x, where we hear the most complaints)<p>Windows & visual studio has always been our preferred developer environment, with the latest version of both. Maintaining support back to Windows XP has been particularly easy and painless. Where on Linux, it seems like the glibc requirements march forward with every release of gcc, and on osx it becomes dramatically more difficult to support older versions of the os with each new release.<p>A side note about QT on Windows - compiling QT and your application on the newest version of Windows helps a lot for customers on that platform - for instance, before we compiled on Windows 8, the application UI would default back to the legacy battleship grey theme, and simply rebuilding on Windows 8 with no source modifications fixed it.",1433560454

I refer you to the Eiffel and Ada language specifications for possible ways to specify such contracts, invariants, and pre- and postconditions. Common convention is that functions that return a value do not have visible side-effects at all (the Ada &#x27;83 rationale specifically found limitations that disallowed all side effects at the language level too limiting). See: Command-query separation. Adhering to CQS, queries do not mutate arguments, and commands are expected to; hence, you need to know the specific contracts for commands and how they affect their arguments, but can rely on query arguments not changing.<p>More generally, mutability of arguments is just one aspect of a contract;  importantly, in order to be able to optimize or change the internal representation of an object, we may desire the option of having mutability of the concrete state even where the abstract state remains immutable (e.g. splay trees or self-organizing lists, arguments that have internal caches, etc.). Languages that force a knowledge of immutability of the concrete state at the call site can thus violate principles of modularity in that they limit how the implementation may change.<p>Declarations of immutability of only the location of the variable at the call site (as with out/ref parameters in C#) are of even more limited value; while they guard against some clerical errors, it is not clear that this protection justifies the additional syntactic footprint.<p>Back to Nim: The simple solution to ensure that a variable is not being modified by the callee, if you desire that, is to use a &quot;let&quot; rather than a &quot;var&quot; declaration. In fact, using &quot;let&quot; for values that you do not intend to change further and only use &quot;var&quot; variables where they are expected to be mutated throughout a procedure is already idiomatic Nim [1] and should guard against the majority of related clerical errors of this kind.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/Style-Guide-for-Nim-Code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/Style-Guide-for-Nim-Code</a>",1433559786

It can only be &quot;free&quot; in the sense that in many cases they decide to not charge each other for the privilege of sending data, as long as the connection benefits both sides equally. Both sides still have the cost of buying equipment and running their infrastructure to actually transport data to/from the connection point.<p>If one side dumps of a lot of traffic towards the other they can save investments in their own infrastructure: e.g. if a provider gives all their traffic going to the east coast to someone else at a peering point in LA, then they save the money necessary to maintain a good connection across the US, and the other has to pay for that. Which is why they might not be willing to do it for free if they see no equivalent benefit for it.<p>Example: Normal customers have to pay their ISPs for their connections, because the ISP doesn&#x27;t gain anything from giving you internet for free.<p>But if google offers peering they&#x27;ll probably say yes, because they can&#x27;t tell their customers &quot;sorry, we don&#x27;t connect to google&quot; and if they can get the data to google as close to you as possible, the less cost they have transporting it.<p>And if Netflix wants a connection (and send TONS of data their way), they might do it for free, because good connection to netflix == happy customers. Or they might think that Netflix has more to gain from a good connection than they do and they demand Netflix pay for it.",1433559644

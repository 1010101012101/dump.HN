Often I don't succeed in that but sometimes I do and it feels good.<p>Give me an interesting task that has few dependencies to others and you're going to have a hard time removing me from the computer. Give me a loose task that requires a lot of waiting and you're going to have a hard time removing me from HN or from other interests.<p>If I try to be highly productive all the time, I just fail myself and get depressed. Since that doesn't work I try to optimize my workflow by working on things that benefit from the idle lulls. Tasks that last days or weeks are most suitable: there might be a lot of ""idling"" but when I get to writing code I can bang 16 hours straight and accomplish in a day what would otherwise have taken ten days.<p>Conversely, doing a lot of communication-bound work will soon make me feel busy and exhausted. I'll be waiting or polling something all the time, and what's worse, I can't start anything I think is real work because I have to maintain the stack of pending tasks all the time so I know how to unwind when they finish one by one. If I dive into something then it'll take even more time for me to figure out what to do when I next hit the event loop again.<p>I try to teach myself that even little work <i>is enough</i>: working like I would love to work, the artist's way of work, is pretty much impossible in a business environment. If I'm confident I've done enough eventhough it's nothing compared to a weekend roll with a hobby project, then I don't feel so bad about getting ""nothing"" done. And when I get done a lot, I try to enjoy it as a precious window of time rather than the minimal bar I should reach in the following weeks.",1329044262

3581556,comment,3581442,3581442,17,0,pron,,,"Oh those poor, poor sheep. It's funny how eagerly people are willing to give up their privacy and freedom for some marginal benefit. And Facebook's dangers will always vastly outweigh its meager benefits. A relative of mine was just denied residency at a prestigious hospital when the admissions committee found out through Facebook that she has children, and there are numerous other examples. And the root of the problem is more than Facebook's monopoly or terrifying business model; these will be somewhat mitigated when its services, which have proven so far to be essential, will be commoditized (just like e-mail) by the wonderful Diaspora* and others like it. The root of the problem is people's willingness to expose themselves. And maybe I'm wrong, and it's not a problem at all but a cultural shift, or maybe even a necessary outlet for a human desire that's always been there.<p>What I am certain of is that Facebook's IPO comes at a time of peak-Facebook. The ridiculous valuations Facebook and other web companies, and the outlandish profit multipliers analysts bestow on them never cease to amaze me. When companies grow so quickly it's hard to know when something really mirrors a true market shift or is just a fad. And even if it's not a fad, competitors can disrupt the market just as easily. After all, if investors expect upcommers to succeed so quickly, it must surely mean that they expect ""established"" companies to fail just as quickly; you can't have it both ways. Who could have predicted five years ago that Facebook will pose such a threat to Google (search)? Search seemed like it will forever be the preferred method of finding things online. And so will Facebook be displaced (or squeezed) by something new that comes along, or its product commoditized and Facebook turned into AOL circa 1994. The whole web economy is built on black swans (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory</a>).<p>But whenever Facebook's inevitable market decline arrives (and it will happen quite soon), the question remains whether people's extroversion or naivete will continue to be fodder for web corporations. I would like to hope that with time and with the proper lessons learned, this behavior, too, will decline.<p>Good article, BTW.",1329044062

3581554,comment,3581386,3581488,3,0,lusr,,,"I'd argue that having a blocked credit card is FAR more manageable than a blocked debit card and this is precisely why I almost always only carry credit cards (I also move my income into an investment account from my cheque account as soon as I'm paid, less expenses expected in the next week).<p>Firstly, most recurring billing systems are built with credit card failures in mind - the card can expire or be listed as a hot card, for instance, and needs to be updated.  This has happened to me and you are not penalised in any way.  I've also, once or twice, gone over my limit without the card being rejected - the bank seems to give me some sort grace credit.  This is fine by me since any fraudulent transactions on a credit card are <i>claims</i> against me that the bank needs to prove.  I can switch to another credit card if that card gets marked as a hot card.<p>Secondly, a debit card is usually linked to a cheque or savings account. If it's a cheque account you could end up incurring overdraft charges which totally screw you over and mess up your standing with the bank;  if it's a savings account, you're screwed out of your savings while the bank investigates and returns your money (bank I worked for until recently stated that it takes SIX WEEKS to investigate when a friend's debit card was cloned... that's a lot of lost interest).",1329043884

3581550,comment,3581157,3581157,7,0,Sanddancer,,,"This is a deeper issue than just firewire. Yes, disabling firewire will stop this one vector of the attack, but there are plenty of other devices out there that can use DMA channels. I imagine someone halfway decent with vhdl and other languages can code an fpga that'll take the pci-e channel and enumerate as another device that the OS has DMA drivers for, like a SATA controller chipset or a sound card. From there, one has to implement just enough of the expected behaviors -- for a SATA controller, perhaps pretend to have a 1 meg drive attached to it, for example -- to get a DMA channel and continue as with the firewire attack.<p>The issue here is that Apple, like most OS vendors, still don't seem to use the IOMMU facilities built into chipsets, especially for untrusted devices, like anything connected to a thunderbolt port. Considering that the Firewire attack has been known for several years, it's rather foolish that a company would implement a spec that can provide direct access to RAM without such basic precautions.",1329043825

The camera is, sadly, always situated just above the lead vehicle in the selected platoon. A free roaming camera would have been better as it would have given you more opportunities to view the action. Still, the camera is very useful and really succeeds at drawing you into the action. The camera is very, very easy to use--just bump the edges of your screen with the mouse...well, the mouse cursor, not the actual mouse itself. The camera then spins around the lead unit of the platoon. Vertical movement isn't as good. The angle of the camera doesn't allow you to look straight down on your units or get down on the ground beside them. Oh well, c'est la guerre. There's also a Strategic view that's better for getting an overall impression of the terrain elevation, but it's no good for seeing the action.

3581531,comment,3577454,3580792,1,0,csallen,,,"Thanks for the post. I find myself both agreeing with some of your points, but disagreeing with the way you've chosen to frame the debate:<p><pre><code>  I agree that:\n    - theft necessarily deprives the victim of property\n    - an of act copyright infringement *can* adversely affect the victim\n    - copyright gives many people an incentive to create art\n    - some artists support themselves entirely via profits from copyright\n  I disagree that:\n    - copyrighted material is the equivalent of property\n    - copyright infringement *ever* deprives the victim of property\n    - an act of copyright infringement necessarily affects the victim adversely\n    - copyright infringement today noticeably harms the progress of the arts\n</code></pre>\nYour view -- that copyrights make an author's work the ""property"" of that author -- is extremely common. Given the historical evidence, however, I believe that view is completely at odds with the purposes of copyright (in the US, at least). In the words of Thomas Jefferson:<p><pre><code>  ""Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give\n  an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men\n  to pursue ideas...""\n</code></pre>\nOur copyright laws do not treat words, ideas, thoughts, etc as property that can be owned. They simply give artists exclusive rights to how their creations can be <i>used</i>: copied, sold, displayed, performed, etc. Infringing upon someone's copyrighted work by performing it without permission, for example, is therefore not the same as theft. Even the Supreme Court of the United States agrees: ""...interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud.""<p>This technical/legal difference translates into a moral difference, because it necessarily changes the way you view the issue. The Constitution's framers consistently espoused that speech, ideas, and invention should be free, and that copyright is an <i>exception</i> to this freedom. It was created <i>solely</i> to provide incentives for creation, not because it's ""morally necessity"" to compensate authors. If anything, it was viewed a moral <i>wrong</i>, allowed <i>only</i> because of the incentives it created. More quotes:<p><pre><code>  ""That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the\n  moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to\n  have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature... Society may give an\n  exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to\n  pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done,\n  according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint\n  from anybody... generally speaking, other nations have thought that these\n  monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society""\n  -- Thomas Jefferson\n\n  ""That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be\n  glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we\n  should do freely and generously.""\n  --Benjamin Franklin\n</code></pre>\nSo copyright infringement is certainly not the equivalent of theft. All that said, you may claim that it remains immoral because it decreases artistic incentives, and in doing so hinders the progress of the arts and sciences. If you were to say that, I would agree with you completely. However, today we've expanded the umbrella of what qualifies as an ""infringement"" much too far.<p>Original copyright law focused almost exclusively on profits. Works could be shared, read, performed, displayed, etc, as long as it was done in private and for free. Only for-profit public uses of a work required permission from the author. The point was not to force everyone who enjoyed your work to pay, but to ensure that you had a <i>monopoly</i>. In other words, to ensure that no one could compete with you financially. For example, another artist using your work and selling it.<p>Today, things are different. We have the internet, CD copying, file sharing, etc. These allow people to enjoy share and enjoy artistic works <i>freely and privately</i>. It's not the same as, say, copying 1000 VHS tapes and selling them to passersby on the street.<p>So when the record labels lobby Congress to make file-sharing illegal, because now they only make $10billion a year instead of $14billion, that's a perversion of copyright law. <i>That's</i> what's immoral. Copyright law doesn't exist to guarantee middlemen insane profits. Nor does it exist to control what citizens do for free in their own homes, whether or not that activity ultimately affects artistic profits. It exists to provide sufficient incentives, and <i>that's it.</i><p>The ONLY argument for the immorality of piracy must revolve around whether it is actually harmful to the progress of the arts. My question to you is this: Has the rampant file-sharing made possible by the internet harmed artistic or scientific progress? Are books and movies and plays and inventions disappearing? Is the current state of things unsustainable? Most certainly not. If anything, the opposite is true: sharing on the internet has only <i>spurred</i> the creation of new arts and invention by creating a bigger and more easily-accessible market than has ever existed.<p>The question can also be presented in reverse: Has the repeated extension of copyright terms, lobbied for by giant content companies, helped the arts? When oure forefathers created copyright law, it lasted a maximum of 28 years. Today it lasts for an entire lifetime PLUS 70 years. Entire decades worth of movies, books, music, etc are being lost, as they remain under the control of copyright owners who have abandoned them because they are no longer profitable. The public <i>could</i> have and <i>would</i> have maintained them and improved upon them. But instead, we have to watch them rot. I'll finish with this quote, from a court case in 1821:<p><pre><code>  ""While one great object was, by holding out a reasonable reward to inventors, and\n  giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited period, to\n  stimulate the efforts of genius; the main object was `to promote the progress of\n  science and useful arts;' and this could be done best, by giving the public at\n  large a right to make, construct, use, and vend the thing invented, at as early a \n  period as possible, having a due regard to the rights of the inventor. If an\n  inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the\n  secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the\n  monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole\n  profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure;\n  and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to\n  secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus\n  exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it\n  during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and  \n  the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to\n  communicate their discoveries.""</code></pre>",1329042892

3581513,comment,3581103,3581194,2,0,todsul,,,"Is AWS really that great for startups (under $100/month hosting)? What about Linode et al? AFAIK, AWS is min $70/month to host a regular dynamic website, whereas Linode starts at $19/month. With intelligent caching (ESI, etc), that $19 can handle 500+ req/sec. Or say 20k+ req/sec for static files (i.e full-page cached sites). Sure there are limitations, but I'd imagine Linode/Slicehost/Rackspace (unmanaged) being better for statups who run regular dynamic websites (with little need for serious elasticity). These VPS providers have load balancing, great communities, good doco, month-to-month contracts, etc.<p>Admittedly, this isn't my field, so I'd love to hear from someone in-the-know about whether Linode is on par with AWS with regard to most startups (who don't need the extra services Amazon provide over VPS providers).",1329042330

I didn't read that particular article or the discussion (I find Noam Chomsky to be...benign in his absurdity), but it seemed interesting to other folks, so I didn't mind it.<p>This meta-discussion is actually kinda weird and doesn't really fit the character of the place, either.<p>Maybe we shouldn't encourage this sort of thing, and just let the votes and editors do their jobs.",1242021338

So Facebook isn't popular just because everyone's on there. Of course, that helps. One could argue that its strength in that time was having everyone at your college on Facebook.",1242021287

603047,comment,602531,602625,0,0,dhs,,,"The traditional way of financing print media was to have the advertisers pay for the paper, printing and administration, whereas the purchasing price went to pay for the actual journalism, the researchers, writers, editors. That way, at least the good, investigative journalism was independent of the advertisers, and could even criticize them. The web made the paper/printing costs vanish, but also the purchasing price, so now the news-consuming public does not pay the journalists any more. Web advertising and ambitious news gathering (which is not afraid to investigate the behavior of the advertising companies if there's a good story to be found) are mutually exclusive.<p>And it's a cheap shot to tell the journalists: ""Go find yourself a better business nodel, you old-media turkeys hahaha."" People who used to pay for content stop doing so, advertisers will not pay for content that they can't control and that might investigate their own companies, and we're loosing independent journalism that way. There's a bit too much joking about this for my liking.",1242020829

I'm not pushing Scheme or the metacircular evaluator as the totality of theoretical or applied computer science. My interest is entirely in the educational value of building a REPL versus, say, a robotic control system. MIT has a <i>lot</i> of robotics opportunities from clubs to IAP (winter term) competitions to UROPs (undergrad research). MIT doesn't have a lot of REPL building opportunities.<p>In fact, I believe it is possible with the new curriculum to graduate from MIT with a degree in CS and have <i>never</i> built a REPL or a compiler.

Scheme and Scheme's approach to programming can, I'm sure, be useful as one part of a larger curriculum, but more often it feels as if I'm talking to someone who, say, learned how to take a derivative via limits, and then decided that it would be all right never to learn anything more about calculus in the course of a mathematics degree.

603010,comment,602942,602997,0,0,tolmasky,,,"Perhaps his point is not that they should take down the denier groups but instead let back in the breast feeding pictures.<p>Clearly the tone of the article doesn't make that appear to be the case, but Arrington is indeed correct in pointing out a discrepancy here. I find it funny that people champion Facebook in the comments for taking such a ""high ground"", when clearly they are <i>not</i> doing so in the case of breast feeding images. Facebook <i>is</i> censoring its content, albeit making some controversial choices, but censoring all the same.<p>If free speech is free speech, then the images should be allowed back on. There exists no reasonable argument for removing them outside of ""they're offensive to X group"", and that is the exact same argument being made about the denier situation.<p>I think its great that Facebook has relatively pro free speech attitudes, but let's not kid ourselves here: every choice about what stays on and what doesn't is purely based on marketing. In this country we have a problem with nudity, so the breast feeding pictures are out. If enough people got angry about the denier groups, I guarantee those would be taken out as well. At the end of the day, its absolutely true that these choices are a function of cowardice: not wanting to upset certain demographics that would leave their service.",1242018418

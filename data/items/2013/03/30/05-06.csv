Because compression requires some minimum amount of data before it can even begin to compress, let alone start to send the compressed bitstream over a physical link.

Take classes in different languages (classes comparing languages are even better).  I find it difficult to learn new languages, particularly new paradigms, without the help of someone who knows them.<p>-Low-level stuff.  Assembly, basic electronics, C.  These are the topics I found classes covered the best (compared to learning on my own).  It's not directly relevant to my job, but I just have a generally better sense of how computers work.<p>-Work in groups.  I didn't do enough of this, and I think it handicapped me a bit.

Get invested in the topic, meet people, learn some stuff and see if any connections arise. You meet people in the real world in situations that you have in common, and that's how finding relationships online should be too. Some people may want the instant-gratification of going out to a bar to meet this person or maybe they're just gunning for a one-night-stand, which is fine too. But if my friends are anything to base things off of, distance is no longer an issue for people looking for serious, long-term relationships.

But the university owns literally 5-6 city blocks of prime Chicago real estate (tax free, of course). It's interesting to note that between 1972 and 1994, there was no new construction on the Northwestern Memorial campus. Then in 1999, two huge new buildings went up, then a women's hospital in 2007, a new children's hospital in 2012, and a new outpatient facility is slated to open in next year. These are each $350-500 million high-rise buildings. And these aren't utilitarian buildings of the kind that were pervasive in the 1970's. They're nicer than most F500 headquarters.",1364621808

It's very easy to put on a symposium with a 60-70% acceptance rate: you just filter out the stuff that is clearly not good, and is not going to contribute. It's not <i>much</i> harder to go to 40-50%: you raise your bar for how well thought out something needs to be, how well it needs to ground itself in the existing research, and how good the prose itself needs to be.<p>But once you start going south of that, things quickly get problematic. Now you start rejecting decent stuff, for reasons that depend on random assignment of reviewers: some reviewers are harsher than others, and if you don't correct for it, that impacts things. You have not easily comparable factors: is borderline contribution in area A better or worse than borderline contribution in area B? How precisely do you weight every possible factor? Is interestingness, rigor, or clearness of communication more important? You also, as you get towards 10-20% acceptance rates, easily end up slipping into a mode where papers get accepted more because of ""can't find a reason to reject it"" rather than ""would actually want to accept it"". Reviewers become very critical (since most papers need to be rejected), and look for any reason they can find to reject a paper. So what survives is not the <i>best</i> papers, but the papers nobody could find a good enough reason to reject. What that usually means is either 1) airtight incremental work; or 2) blockbuster media-friendly work.<p>More generally, I think it gets exponentially harder to make any kind of review process meaningful as you accept a smaller and smaller percentage of applications. I believe I can honestly set up a screening system for accepting the top 30% of an applicant pool with at least <i>acceptable</i> error. But the top 5%? It starts looking like rolling dice. If Stanford does it better, I'd love to know how!",1364619917
